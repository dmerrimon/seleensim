participatory collaboration in developi[INVESTIGATOR_475357] c ommunity co-leadership and input.  
This led to further changes in the design, including an expansion of outcomes to include 
employment status and homel essness risk factors and prioritization among other outcomes; 
expansion of the scope of agencies , provide r types , and client populations to include a wider 
range of community-based agencies and vulnerable client populations such as  the homeless and 
prisoner re -entry clients, seniors, substance abusers, and neighborhoods with high concentrations 
of African Ame ricans.  To respond to these community priorities, a competing supplement 
proposal was submitted and two of four requested years were funded, which resulted in an 
expansion in expected client sample size and restoration of some data collection elements  
dropped with budget cuts (e.g.,  12-month client outcomes ).  Subsequently, there was a second 
wave of community input with final  changes in outcomes  to include homelessness risk factors as 
outcomes resulting in a decision to increase client enrollment by a fur ther 20% because with 
inclusion of the homeless and criminal justice populations there was an expected decrease in 
follow-up response from 80 to 65-70%.  In addition, at this stage community input led to some 
changes in intervention design, including: 1) inclusion for both intervention conditions of materials to support lower level staff in providing education, case management, screening and 
tracking outcomes; and resources for team management ; as well as: 2) an increase in the 
intensity of the technical as sistance intervention to be comparable to best- available technical 
assistance for evidence- based practice in public sector agencies.  T he final protocol that was 
implemented remains broadly consistent with the original aims of the project but with outcomes 
more consistent with community priorities for functional status, wellness, and avoiding 
homelessness; a more intensive comparison intervention; a more diverse agency sample with 
more emphasis on community agencies; and greater  planned client enrollment.  Because this 
document concerns client outcomes only, we present information in this Protocol only on aims,

 2. Specific Aims  
Under- resourced communities of color in low income, largely ethnic -minority neighborhoods 
face an excess ive burden of illness from depression due to higher prevalence of depression and 
lower access to quality care.  1   Evidence-based quality improvement (QI) programs for 
depression in primary care settings—where many low -income and minority patients receive their 
only mental health care —can enhance quality of depression care and improve health outcomes. 
These programs are under -utilized in community -based health care s ettings, and have not been 
adapted for use across diverse agencies (social service, faith based, primary and specialty care) 
that could partner to support disease management for depression.  Partners in Care (PIC)2, 3  and 
WE Care4 are interventions designed to improve access to evidence- based depression treatments 
(medication management or psychotherapy) for prima ry care patients and, in WE Care, social 
service clients. PIC evaluated a services delivery intervention while WE Care was an effectiveness trial with study -provided treatments. Both studies promoted use of the same 
evidence -based treatments. Both PIC and WE Care programs improved use of evidence- based 
treatments for depression and health outcomes for African Americans and Latinos.  The PIC 
interventions reduced health outcome disparities evident in usual care in the first follow- up year 
and at five- year fo llow-up.  While these findings offer hope to under- resourced communities, 
such communities have poor resources to support implementation of these programs, and may 
have historical distrust in research and health care settings. There is no evidence- based ap proach 
to support agency networks in under- resourced communities in implementing QI programs for 
depression.  To address this information gap, we proposed Community Partners in Care (CPIC), 
a group- level randomized, controlled trial, with randomization at the level of an agency site or 
“unit.” The trial is  fielded in two underserved communities, Hollywood and South Los Angeles, 
and conducted through a community- participatory, partnered research (CPPR) ap proach.  The 
specific aims are:  
1. To engage two communities of color in improving safety-net care for depression.  
2. To examine the effects on three levels of stakeholders of an innovative, community-engagement and network capacity building intervention that implements PIC and WE Care 
QI toolkits, compared to low-intensity dissemination (i.e., control).  The control condition 
that includes review of findings and toolkits in a conference followed by [CONTACT_475388] a website.  The stakeholders and outcomes of interest are:

This study builds on our extensive prior work in PIC/ WE Care and pi[INVESTIGATOR_475358] a model of community engagement in under- resourced 
communities of color to depression QI, and in the Community Partner ship Initiative to  develop 
agency networks in under- resourced communities in Los Angeles that are concerned with mental 
health and substance abuse issues. The proposal initiates a long- term research agenda, by 
[CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_475359] a community engagement approach and a 
more standard time -limited technical assistance approach to implementing community- wide 
quality improvement programs for depression in under-resourced communities. 
 
3. Background and Significance  
Overview:  In the last decade, there has been increasing attention by [CONTACT_240645], providers, the 
public, and scientists to the “quality chasm” or gap between the promise of clinical research and 
the realities of clinical practice, including for psychiatric conditions su ch as depression.5, 6  The 
Institute of Medicine defines quality as the effectiveness, efficiency, client -centeredness, 
timeliness, and equity of care. 6  McGlynn and her colleagues found that only 55% of persons 
with a chronic health condition received appropriate care; and quality of care for depression was close to this mediocre average.
[ADDRESS_609501] that the community engagement approach, through increasing access, will increase services use across health and social services sectors.  
 While there has been increasing attention to workforce impacts of mental health conditions including depression,
15 few data are available on the effects of improving care for 
depression on employment in underserved communities, particularly on entry into employment for the unemployed.  Employment and work productivity losses comprise 62% of the economic 
burden of depression, and are estimated to be 51.[ADDRESS_609502] individual program technical assistance approach, leads to 
improved employment outcomes, addressing an important gap in the literature. 
 The existence of a quality gap and outcome disparities constitute evidence of a “science 
dissemination” gap23-[ADDRESS_609503] that a sound 
framework to improve depression care in underserved communities should incorporate effective 
interventions at three levels: evidence -based treatments; quality improvement strate gies; and 
community- based implementation  strategies that can be applied across the diverse agencies 
supporting underserved clients. Underserved communities of color often have poor resources to

“action research”43, 44 and “engaged scholarship.”[ADDRESS_609505], individual agency technical assistance model.  
Depression as a Tracer Condition:  Depression, i.e., unipolar depressive disorder, is an excellent 
“tracer” condi tion for studying quality of care because of its high prevalence (at least 8 -10% of 
the population in a year49 and associated morbidity.  Our prior work has shown that depression is 
associated with as much or more limitation in daily functioning and well- being as most major 
chronic conditions such as diabetes 50-[ADDRESS_609506] 
definition of depression for this proposal, “probable depressive disorder” that includes persons with depressive disorder and those with depressive symptoms without having a current 
depressive disorder, because that full range can benefit from disease management.  
Many persons with depression do not receive mental health care, and most receive such 
care through primary care or community agencies, such as faith -based settings.
11, 65, [ADDRESS_609507]- party management of services; clinical features of 
depression such as social withdrawal; so cietal factors such as social stigma and limited public 
knowledge; and clinician factors such as limited knowledge or experience.5, 14, 29, [ADDRESS_609508] decade, many in need of depression care did not receive counseling, medications, or referral.
66 The poor and ethnic 
minorities are particularly unlikely to receive needed care.14, 29, 73   There are many barriers to 
provision of evidence-based psychotherapy such as lack of criteria for licensing providers in 
such treatments.5, 38  Outside of organized group practices, coordination between primary and 
mental health care is often difficult, given widespread use of “carve-out” behavioral health management companies that operate largely independently of health plans or medical practices.
5, 
26  Public sector mental health agencies prioritize clients with severe and persistent illness, while 
public primary care agencies are not organized or financed to support ongoing mental health 
care.  The proposed community engagement intervention is designed to help compensate for 
these factors by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_475360]. 
Quality Improvement for Depression:  There have been several demonstrations of the 
effectiveness of QI programs for depression in primary care74 suggesting that: 1) collaborative 
care75 improves quality of care and health outcomes for depressed patients14, 76 -83; more efficient 
methods, such as telephone case management improve outcomes84-86; 3) multimodal strategies 
that include case management tend to be more effective than improving clinician knowledge or 
Page 10 of 72 
 skills alone87-89; 4) such programs can improve outcomes for adolescents90 and the elderly81, 91; 
and 4) active outreach strategies help engage low -income and minority groups in such care.4, 92 
The President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommended implementing QI 
programs for depression, citing the IMPACT study as a model.[ADDRESS_609509] been stimulating dissemination through financing innovations,
94, 95 information technology,81, 96 clarifying gains for purchasers 
(caremangementfordepression.org),18 or developi[INVESTIGATOR_475361].97   
Partners in Care (PIC) was a group -level randomized trial in which managed, primary 
care practices were randomized to usual care or one of two QI programs that provided resources 
to encourage use of evidence-based treatments for depressed adults. Both interventions were 
implemented by [CONTACT_475389] g 
clinicians, patients, and intervention staff.  One intervention facilitated use of evidence- based 
medication management through supporting nurse care managers for 6-12 months, while the 
other facilitated access to evidence -based therapy for depression through lowering the copay for 
sessions with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_475362] (CBT) for Depression.60 The 
interventions improved quality of care, depression and quality- of-life outcomes and employment 
status over two years; and they generated cost- effectiveness ratios relative to usual care within 
the range expected for a widely -used medical therapy.13, 14, [ADDRESS_609510] follow- up year 4 and 
at five -years, particularly under the therapy- resource model .3  The PIC interventions facilitated 
use of evidence- based treatments following practice priorities and resources and patient and 
clinician preferences,14, 98, 99 and thus are suitable for use with a community- engagement 
approach because they permit the flexibility to fit implementation to network needs.  The PIC therapy -based QI is the proposed services intervention f or this study because it was effective 
over time among Latinos and African Americans.
3  WE Care is unique among depression 
interventions in encouraging and facilitating access to evidence- based treatments for depression 
among low-income, minority women who visited community social service agencies or health clinics. The study found that active outreach was necessary for increasing the engagement of 
low-income women in care, and that efforts to decrease structural barriers to care by [CONTACT_475390].
4  WE Care used an individual-
level randomized, controlled designed to compare enhanced community usual care to medication

 management or CBT; and the treatments improved outcomes relative to usual community 
services over the first year.4  WE Care has the social service setting and client activation 
approaches to complement the PIC services delivery approach.  The two studies used consistent treatment protocols.  
CPPR and Community Engagement Depression Initiatives:
  Community Participatory Partnered 
Research promotes equal partnership of community and academic partners while building 
capacity for partnered planning and community implementation of research-informed 
programs.[ADDRESS_609511] involves identifying a health issue that fits community and academic priorities; developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coalition of stakeholders who inform and support the 
initiative; engaging  the community through activities that provide information, determine 
readiness to proceed, and obtain input; and initiating work groups that develop, implement, and evaluate action plans.
[ADDRESS_609512] and active and inclusive participation; power 
sharing and equity; mutual benefit; and flexibility in  pursuing goals, methods, and timeframes to 
fit priorities and capacities of communities.
30, 36   
Because we found long-lasting outcome gains for depressed minorities in PIC and WE 
Care, we initiated pi[INVESTIGATOR_48085] t studies of CPPR and community engagement concerning depression in 
the communities for this proposal. One pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Witness for Wellness (W4W), led by [CONTACT_475391] (witness4wellness.org),31 developed a coalition of 40 community 
agencies and academic institutions to assess, in the community, the salience of depression and the PIC/WE Care interventions. The coalition sponsored a conference attended by [CONTACT_46431] 500 
community members and providers, in which support for this focus emerged.
31  Data from 
surveys and field notes of discussion groups framed the charge for 3 working groups that formulated action plans that were approved by [CONTACT_475392].
101  Supporting Wellness 
focused on policy and advocacy, and secured membership in Los Angeles County’s planning for 
Page [ADDRESS_609513] ance abuse 
counselors, and social workers. These pi[INVESTIGATOR_475363].  Conceptual Framework :
 The field of implementation and dissemination research is emerging in 
mental health.  The relevant literature derives from diffusion of innovation theory,104-[ADDRESS_609514] depression services 
delivery. According to diffusion theory, ‘complexity’ and ‘trialability’ may affect adoption.  In 
addition, resources for dissemination may interact with community priorities and capacities to 
influence practice. The arrow between these constructs represents the community -engagement 
Page [ADDRESS_609515] arrow 
represents the implementation plans, their adoption, fit to network, and sustaina bility. Care 
influences outcomes of stakeholders, which influence capacities for community planning, 
iteratively.  Our design mirrors this framework.  
In Figure 1, we indicate by a star areas potentially affected by [CONTACT_475393].  
We stimulate  community engagement through a participatory, network development model.31, 32, 
38  We introduce into these partnerships the PIC/WE Care toolkits and training and their 
adaptations for the capacities of diverse safety -net agencies.  The proposed study design 
experimentally varies org anizational exposure to the community engagement intervention versus 
low-intensity dissemination. During the study, the lead community agencies (QueensCare, 
HAAF, DMH), host a conference that facilitates feedback on the outcomes of implementation. 
The proposed planning process may affect organizational commitment, a component of culture, 
and receptivity to innovation, a component of climate.  By [CONTACT_475394] a 
network, we hope to increase partnership capacity.  By [CONTACT_475395] f or implementing 
evidence -based toolkits, we hope to improve knowledge, attitudes, skills, and commitment to 
sustained change.   
Figure 1 is a framework and not a specific theory, but is suited to applying concepts from 
theories to guide hypotheses. We rely on concepts from diffusion of innovation45, 104 
organizational learning114, 115 116 and network theories117, 118 social movement theory,16, 119, 120 
social learning theory,121 a community engagement framework31 and a community intervention 
model for fitting intervention needs to agency capacity.3  PIC applies the collaborative care 
model of chronic disease management,75 which is based on diverse theories including social 
influence theory110, 122, 123 and social learning theory,124 CBT, one of the treatments promoted by 
[CONTACT_475396]/WE Care, is based on social cognitive learning theory.59

We suggest that stakeholder trust, ownership, and commitment generated by a community 
engagement approach is a necessary but not sufficient step to promoting implementation and 
sustainability of evidence -based programs in underserved communities. Resources to support use 
of programs and their availability and flexibility for adaptation to network capacities are required.  We rely on organizational learning and network theories to explicate how agencies 
learn to establish “commu nities of practice” by [CONTACT_475397], sharing knowledge, 
and developi[INVESTIGATOR_475364].  We use 
diffusion of innovation theory to understand the process of implementation and the 
characteristi cs of interventions that promote adoption and sustainability.  In particular, we 
introduce systematic variation in organizations’ support for implementation. How organizations “fit” evidence- based programs to their structures, the structures they create, and the experience 
of participants in doing so, will be the subject of an implementation process evaluation.  We will use concepts from these diverse theories and frameworks and project data to specify a conceptual 
model of the process of implementation.       
Page 15 of 72 
 For some services delivery interventions, such Multisystemic Therapy125 and Assertive 
Community Treatment,98, 126, 127 a high degree of fidelity is necessary to improve outcomes.  We 
think that variable adherence to PIC/WE Care will be effective, because positive outcomes have 
been observed across diverse QI program s65, 74 and less intensive models.84 A similar assumption 
underlies initiatives to promote use of depression QI programs in primary care through financing and other innovations.
66, 95, 97  
 4. Research Des ign and Methods  
We propose a group-level, randomized controlled tria l to assess the effectiveness of a community 
engagement intervention, compared to an individual program technical assistance intervention, in 
increasing community agency and clinician use of quality improvement interventions for 
depression; and improving client quality of care and outcomes.  The project is longitudinal at 
three levels of stakeholders: agency/administrator, clinicians/case worker, and client.  The study 
is conducted in two, underserved, largely minority communities in Los Angeles: Hollywood and 
South Los Angeles.  We considered alternative designs, including an observational (pre-post) 
design and randomizing at the individual client or provider level.  An observational study has 
less internal validity; individual-level randomization risks contamination of conditions.   
We will recruit agencies (social service agencies, primary care agencies, and mental 
health agencies, and community partners such as faith -based organizations), using the 
Community Partnership Initiative sampling frame, and their “units,” or service locations or teams, which we also refer to as “programs.”  50 -60 units or programs (expanded in the revision 
to 70-80; and then considering addition of homeless/prisoner re- entry to 80 -100 programs) , 
balanced across the two communities and including diverse agencies, will be selected and 
randomized to the community engagement or low-intensity control dissemination condition.  The 
first year is a planning phase for agency and provider recruitment and intervention and measures 
modification and documentation with community input. (With community input the planning 
year was expanded to 2 years to accommodate recruitment of the larger program and client 
sample; all benchmarks and timelines discussed below were shifted to one year later).  Between 
months 6-12, we will field the baseline web surveys for administrators and clinicians.  Agencies will be recruited in batches, South Los Angeles followed by [CONTACT_475398].  We will host Kick -Off 
Conferences to explain the study to agencies and their representatives and introduce the quality 
Page 16 of 72 
 improvement toolkits that are common to both intervention conditions to all agencies/programs.  
Each conference is followed by [CONTACT_475399], followed six 
months later by [CONTACT_475400] a panel study with 
baseline and [ADDRESS_609516] year of the study.  
4.1. Sampling  
Communities
:  We selected by [CONTACT_475401] (Hollywood and 
South Los Angeles) with large, low-income, mainly minority populations, where we have strong existing partnerships.   
The County of Los Angeles, with nearly [ADDRESS_609517] populous 
and diverse counties in the [LOCATION_002]: of the population, 43.9% are Latino, 33.5% white, 
12.3% Asian, 10% Black and 0.3% American Indian.  Over 20% live below the federal poverty 
level128 with ethnic minorities over -represented among the poor.  South Los Angeles  has a 
population of about 1.5 million, with 60% Hispanic, 35% African American, 3% non- Hispanic 
While and 2% Asian American. The communities of South Los Angeles suffer from some of the 
highest rate of morbidity and mortality and the lowest rate of educational attainment, family 
income and insurance coverage in Los Angeles County.[ADDRESS_609518] half a million: 60% Hispanic, 3% Af rican American, 17% non-Hispanic White and 
17.3% Asian American.  Over half are foreign born and less than half have a high school 
diploma.  A little over a quarter live in poverty and the median household income is 25% less 
than the co unty as a whole.[ADDRESS_609519] percentages 
of adults and children with no regular source of care.130  
Agencies :  The agencies to be included in the study will be those who participated in the 
Community Partnership Initiative and their partners.[ADDRESS_609520] of their sites or ‘units’ that provide services 
to adults and have at least one full- time equivalent clinician or case worker.  Agencies will be 
enrolled in a rolling fashion over six months, grouped into two main batches, one for each area.  We will recruit clinicians from this pool of units and finalize unit selection at the conclusion of 
agency/clinician enrollment by [CONTACT_24473] 13.  
(NOTE: With community input in the design period, the definition of agencies was expanded to 
include homeless-serving, prisoner re-entry and “community-trusted locations, including parks and recreation centers, senior citizen centers, faith-based programs, hair salons, and exercise 
clubs.  In addition, to incorporate community priorities for vulnerable populations into account, 
each community was invited to nominate two vulnerable groups for over-sampling.  South Los 
Angeles selected substance abuse agencies  and neighborhoods with high concentration of 
African Americans.  Hollywood- Metro selected homeless clients and senior citizens. )  
Units  or Programs
:  Sampling will be carried out with sites or autonomous divisions within sites 
as the units to be sampled. We expect to identify at least [ADDRESS_609521] within  strata to obtain  a sample of  unit sample that is 30 -40% primary care, 30-40% social 
service, and 20-30% mental health units that serve more “general community” populations, such 
as CalWorks contract agencies.  In this way, we anticipate having at  least 10 units from each 
category to facilitate fitting statistical models.  We will attempt to enroll about 20 -30% more 
units than needed, to a llow for withdrawal/attrition.  We will include those units in the 
administrator/clinician surveys even if not selected for the main trial to track spi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]-over of intervention activities or parallel types of program exposure from the market. Social service 
agencies are included to participate in screening, education, referral, and case management.  
Primary care settings can play roles in screening, assessment, case management, and treatment.  
Mental health specialty clinics provide treatment, consultation and supervision, and some units 
may participate in screening.  We will replace units with others in the same stratum as needed.  
Units are the “unit of randomization” for this study.  We will enroll units in batches (groups of 
Page 18 of 72 
 units) with “batch” as a blocking factor, randomizing units within batches to intervention or 
control.   
Administrators : Each participating agency will identify a lead administrator.  Some agencies will 
have a second administrator if they have units assigned to both study conditions.  Administrators in all agencies will be asked to complete web -surveys at baseline and 12-18 months .  They will 
be asked to facilitate agency participation in the intervention study and conferences.   
Case Workers and Clinicians :  Using lists of providers/case workers serving adults in 
participating units in the main study, we will randomly select up to 5 full- time case workers or 
clinicians per unit; but we will allow part- time (at least 50%) clinicians if necessary.  We will 
provide them with recruitment packets, followed by [CONTACT_475402].  We will randomly select from the remainder in the same site/agen cy to replace refusers/drop -outs. (NOTE:  With 
community input, the definition of “provider” was expanded to all staff with direct client contact, including volunteers. We offered an invitation to all such staff to participate if they wished.  In 
addition, we permitted staff of participating programs to participate in intervention activities, 
whether or not they enrolled as providers in the study).  Consenting providers will be asked to 
complete baseline and follow -up web surveys at 18 months and to partici pate in implementation 
for PIC/WE Care, depending on their intervention assignment.  In PIC, 2 providers declined participation, and over 90% participated in 18-month surveys.  Providers will learn of their unit’s 
participation status by [CONTACT_475403] -off Conference for their community.  We expect to 
have 175-225 case workers and providers in the main trial (Note: expanded with expansion of the overall study to 250-300) .   
Clients :  In social service, community- based, and primary care units selected for the main trial, 
we will advertise the study with posters and fliers.  On designated screening days, clinic staff 
will invite a consecutive sample of adult clients (over 18) visiting participating clinicians to 
discuss study participation with RAND field staff.  (Note:  With community input, community 
members were hired and supervised by [CONTACT_578]).  Screening will occur over a one-month period for each unit. We expect 6 ,000 adult clients to be approached and 4,200 to complete screener 
surveys.  Those over 18 with a positive depression score will be asked to enroll and complete a baseline interview that day or by [CONTACT_6492] -up telephone call and to participate in a 6-month 
telephone survey.  Clients who do not speak English or Spanish, or who are too confused or agitated to complete the screener will be excluded.  
Page 19 of 72 
 Sample size:  We expect 20% of clients to be eligible, due to the low- income of the communities.  
Some of the community agencies at the CPI [INVESTIGATOR_475365] 75% of their 
population had mild to moderate depression.  Of [ADDRESS_609522] 70% to enroll 
and complete baseline (588), 500 (85%) to complete 6-month, and 470 (80%) to complete 12-
month follow-up, based on PIC experience.  
(NOTE: Client screening protocols were changed in several ways.  First, because the type of 
programs was expanded to include homeless-serving programs and other programs for 
vulnerable populations that did not necessarily have traditional ‘waiting rooms’ we also planned 
to screen at events such as food lines, but for those locations used a random selection rather 
than consecutive selection strategy.  Second, all client targets were increased by [CONTACT_726] 30% 
for the expanded sample for employment analyses and to compensate for lower follow-up 
retention  rates due to inclusion of homeless clients .  However, because depression rates were 
much higher on average than expected (18-50% depending on the sector) and because acceptance of screener and study enrollment offer was higher than expected (greater than 90%), 
we were able to use the same expected number of completed screener surveys to achieve both the 
necessary increases in enrollment and analytic sample for the expanded study.)  
4.2. Intervention Assignment  
Within each community and stratified by [CONTACT_475404], we will randomly assign, using a 
computerized random number generator, the intervention conditions (community engagement 
implementation or low -intensity control dissemination) to the 50-60 units (programs) for 
screening clients.  We will randomiz e additional units only providing implementation support 
(and not supporting client screening) to the two conditions.  Within large networks (e.g., 
QueensCare), we may assign common conditions to collaborating units to maintain network ties.  
We will consider randomizing units that are matched based on program size and client 
sociodemographics, to improve client comparability by [CONTACT_475405], as in PIC.
132  Agency 
administrators and participating clinicians will be informed of their intervention status by [CONTACT_31711] .  
(NOTE:  Because of the large number of programs to be recruited, and the very diverse type of 
sectors recruited, and not all sectors had available up- to-date county lists, we decided to 
determine program eligibility in stages, in order to randomize a set of probable final programs, after which we planned to conduct site visits to determine final eligibility and final agreement of 
programs to participate.)    
Page [ADDRESS_609523]  access to intervention assignment 
information on a “need- to-know” basis (such as to answer questions from progra ms with 
recruitment finalized and notified of intervention status).  Providers will be notified of program 
assignment through their program administrators.  Clients will not be directly notified of their 
program’s intervention status by [CONTACT_1758], but could be notified by [CONTACT_475406]’s administrator 
or providers.  Survey staff for baseline and follow-up status will be blinded to program 
intervention assignment status.     
4.3. Intervention Conditions  
Resources for Services (Individual Program Technical Assistance ): The lower -intensity 
condition is time -limited (3 -4 months) technical assistance to individual programs to implement 
the toolkits of PIC/WE Care at a community conference, with post- conference access to PIC 
toolkits through a website (Table 1 b elow).  Control units will be invited to the final Community 
Feedback Conference and offered assistance post -trial in further use of the intervention 
materials, based on their preferences after reviewing the findings of CPIC.  
(NOTE:  In the community feed back during the design period, this intervention condition was 
significantly expanded in scope with increased intensity, to meet the goal of having technical 
assistance that reasonably approximates the highest standards of implementation of evidence-
based practices in the county based on current training practices.  The resulting model was 
offering programs in this condition up to 12 webinars covering all components of the training 
model as well as offering individual site visits to primary care clinics.  I n addition, with 
community input, the RS Intervention had a leadership team of experts in medication management, case management, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression; staff support 
as well as a community engagement and outreach specialist to help assure that individual 
agencies would participate.  
(Note:  The originally planned collaborative care toolkit from PIC/We-Care for both 
intervention conditions was expanded to accommodate the community’s preference to include all 
staff with direct clien t contact, including nonprofessional and volunteer staff.  We included a 
Page [ADDRESS_609524] using PIC/We-Care and IMPACT toolkits.)

Community Engagement and Planning or CEP :  The CEP intervention condition follows the 
principles of community engagement reviewed above, and promotes the inclusion of relevant stakeholders in planning and recognizes participants as equal partners, promoting mutual respect, 
trust, ownership or products, and equal decision making authority. Inclusiveness is thought to be 
a key factor in the success of coalitions.
133, 134  By [CONTACT_6561] a negotiation of priorities and 
resources across academic and community partners, the intervention builds capacity for research-informed action through knowledge dissemination and community leadership.
31 To support 
community e ngagement, we developed a manual community members30 and guide for academic 
partners.32 The three main phases of this intervention will include a 4-month planning phase led 
by a partnered Council including community leaders from the assigned agencies and study QI and depression experts, guided by [CONTACT_475407], an 
implementation phase following the model of implementation developed in the planning phase, and monitoring and oversight to provide course corrections over that implementation phase.  
(NOTE: CEP was guided by a written manual developed during the design phase using 
community and academic partnered input. In addition, because the RS intervention had a more 
intensive intervention  as described above, the CEP Councils were given a budget of $15K per 
Page 22 of 72 
 community to support trainings, roughly comparable to the study’s costs of supporting the model 
of training in RS).   
CEP Planning and Training : Intervention activities will be initiated at the Kick -off Conference 
for each community.  Attendees will include administrative and clinicians from units in both intervention conditions, and grass-roots community members supported by [CONTACT_475408], QueensCare 
and Behavioral Health Services, the lead community partne rs.  We will provide a study 
orientation and review PIC/WE Care findings and materials and access to the RAND PIC 
website and copi[INVESTIGATOR_475368]  (see Table 1). Grass roots 
members and civic leaders will join discussion groups for CE units only.  In this session, co-chairs for the CE planning council will be elected.  The CE council will meet [ADDRESS_609525] an in-
depth review of the goals, structure, content, and training requirements for PIC/WE Care and our recently adapted materials, and summarize requirements in a spreadsheet. To develop network 
implementation capacity, the council will review the mission, services, staffing and resources of 
participating units, preparing summary tables.  Using CE negotiation principles (e.g., inclusion/fairness) the council will develop strategies to fit network capacities to PIC/WE Care  
requirements. A consensus on the implementation plan will be developed using a modified Delphi approach.
135 The action plan will outline agency roles, provide a blueprint for services 
coordination, and identify key contacts.  For example, social service agencies may be assigned to education or case management roles; community members may be assigned as therapy coaches 
or educators; clinicians may determine which agency provides therapi[INVESTIGATOR_475369].  During the planning period, study experts will train agency leaders in use of 
PIC/WE Care protocols.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_475370] a 2-day conference followed by [CONTACT_245825]-
taped supervision of a first case when possible, as in PIC and WE Care.  Medication experts 
(primary care, specialty care) and case workers/care m anagers will be trained in one- day 
seminars with practice sessions.  Community members will receive 1 -day training as client 
advocates/coaches. Manuals supporting activities by [CONTACT_15098], therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], caseworkers, and 
community coaches will be provided. (NOTE: CEP Councils developed plans for training that fit 
Page 23 of 72 
 each community and were typi[INVESTIGATOR_475371], such as having more 
training sessions, opportunities for make-ups, and more intensive supervision).  
CEP Implementation : Agency intervention leaders, supported by [CONTACT_475409]/case workers in delivering PIC/WE Care protocols and provide consultation and 
supervision. The council will provide oversight, reviewing monthly reports from lead 
administrator s and intervention experts, with feedback to unit leaders and intervention experts.  
These meetings will follow the CE P model for inclusiveness and fairness/respect and include 
grass -root community member perspectives supported by [CONTACT_475408], QueensCare and Behavioral 
Health Services, the lead community -based agencies . The monthly reports from intervention 
leaders will describe progress, problems encountered.  As clients are enrolled, program 
administrative  staff will be notified, with client permission .  Support for use of depression 
treatments will be encouraged for 6 -12 months at the client level as in PIC.  (NOTE:  The 
training model for this condition was modified with community input to be joint training by [CONTACT_475410].  We note that the design calls for notification of programs about 
client enrollment in CPIC but not RS programs ).  
Community Feedback Conference : The lead CBOs will sponsor a Community Feedback 
Conference at 40 months (after all client outcomes data are collected), inviting all CPIC agencies 
as well as civic leaders and community members.  The overall study council co -chairs will 
review outcomes findings, implementation stories, and council recommendations.  Break out groups will discuss implications for implementing and  sustaining depression services in the 
community.  All participating agencies will be supported in having access to and using the study’s intervention materials .  The toolkits and other intervention features for CEP and RS are 
summarized in Table 2.

4.4. Data Sources  and Measures  
Data on agencies include reports from administrators at baseline and follow-up web- surveys at 
12-18 months.  Data on clinicians/case workers will be obtained through self- report web -surveys 
at the same time points. Data on clients will be obtained through screening and baseline surveys 
among those positive for probable depression.  Enrolled depressed clients will participate in [ADDRESS_609526] for validity and reliability. Table 2 summarizes key client 
concepts  (prior to community input), with a star for priority measures (primary and secondary 
outcomes).  We also include important intermediate outcomes.  Client measures will be in English or Spanish.   
Intervention Status
: The main independent variable is  intervention status.   
Client Characteristics : Client demographics and insurance status will be reported at screening 
and baseline.  We will use data from the screener and baseline diagnostic instrument (MINI 136) 
to categorize patients as having depressive disorder (i.e., 12-month major depressive or 
dysthymic disorder plus having 30-day depressive symptoms) versus “subthreshold depression,” 
defined as not having recent disorder but screening positive on the C PIC screener. The 
depression screener will be the Patient Health Questionnaire, 8 -item version (PHQ8) to permit 
comparisons to WE Care and other studies.  We will use items from HCC to assess self- report of 
lifetime diagnosis by a provider of schizophrenia or psychosis or lifetime hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475374].
[ADDRESS_609527] er141 and alcohol problems142 use of avoidant and/or active copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274],14 patient beliefs about depression, and perceived stigma concerns (e.g., difficulty in 
getting a job, getting health insurance, or social relationships).143  The presence of 19 specific 
chronic conditions will be assessed as well as prior provider diagnosis of schizophrenia, prior psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including for psychosis) and use of psychotropic medications.  We 
will include a subset of Katon’s self-efficacy for controlling depression items (e.g., how 
confident are you in your ability to recognize early on when you are starting to get depressed?).  
Suicidal ideation will be assessed as part of the MINI and PHQ9.  Current and past substance use 
Page 27 of 72 
 will be assessed at baseline using a modification of the drug section of the MINI.  (NOTE:  
Given community input, the original planned use of the PIC depression screener was switched to 
the PHQ [ADDRESS_609528] “depression” and the thought was that some clients might not endorsed this item because of discomfort with the word.  We created an 
alternative version without the word depression, included both versions and allowed clients to be 
counted as depressed on the PHQ8 if they endorsed either version of this item; but Pearson 
correlation of the 2 versions was 0.99.)  
Process of Care
:  Clients will also be asked about perceived need for treatment and how likely 
they would be to accept treatment or r eferral if it was recommended. Depressed clients will be 
asked at baseline and follow-up to report their use of primary care and mental health specialty 
services, including physician visits, prescription drugs, emergency room visits, and inpatient care 
over the prior six months.  Following AHRQ13, 56, 144 and prior work we will develop an indicator 
of two or more months of antidepressant medication or 4 or more counseling sessions.47  We will 
derive measures of use of services (e.g., primary care, mental health, emergency rooms, social 
service agencies, faith -based agencies).  Clients who improve may not need treatment over time, 
so we will develop a measure of unmet need for treatment, defined as having probable depression but not receiving appropriate care versus not improved or in care.  This measure 
combines outcomes and treatment data and thus has more power, while preserving intent to treat 
analyses.
13  (NOTE: Based on community input, services use measures were expanded to include 
services in a wide range of services  sectors  in the community relevant to depression, such as 
servi ces in substance abuse agencies, telephone hotlines, self-help groups, community centers 
and other trusted locations) .  
Outcomes of Care.   
Mental and Physical Health -Related Quality of Life:  Clients will complete the SF -12 at baseline 
and follow-up.  Published results support the validity and responsiveness of the SF-12.145  We 
found hig h reliability for telephone and mail- survey administration for the global scale for 
mental health -related quality of life MCS12 (0.84).  The MCS12 is considered the primary 
outcome of interest as it integrates information on negative states such as psychol ogical distress 
and on positive states such as wellness of particular interest to community members, and under 
the hypothesis that the community engagement intervention relative to technical assistance will 
Page 28 of 72 
 increase both depression treatment rates, thus lowering distress as well as increase social 
supports and/or address social determinants of mental health improving mental wellness. 
Depression Status:  We will also include the PHQ9.146 which has different cut-points but 
particularly examining whether there is mild/moderate depression (PHQ score greater than or equal to 10). The PHQ9 is a primary outcome measure under the hypothesis that the community 
engagement intervention would improve through networks access to depression treatments and 
thus lower symptoms.   
(NOTE: Based on community feedback, the highest priority outcome was mental health-
related quality of life and the primary measures for the study were designated as the MCS12 
(community and academic primary outcome) and the PHQ9 (academic primary outcome).  In 
addition, the community placed a high priority of “peace of mind” or mental wellness, so we 
created a sepa rate scale using the positive well-being measures available from these measures 
counting as mental wellness having wellness or any of the 3 items. In addition, the community also placed an emphasis on having good physical activity, especially with the inclusion of senior 
citizen groups in the study.  W e included a single- item measure of physical activity to assess this 
outcome.)   Household and Work Productivity
:  Current employment status will be assessed at baseline and 
follow -up as well as self- assessed work productivity (days of work missed; days late to work or 
left work early; rating of productivity) in the last month. employment and work productivity 
measures will be assessed in all client waves, and will use the World Health Organization Health 
and Productivity Questionnaire,  ( http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/hpq/index.php ) a well -
validated instrument49, 65, 147 that has been used to measure effects of depression treatment on 
employment outcomes (Wang 2007).(NOTE:  These measures were added with the Revision 
proposal, based on the community feedback that employment was a high priority for the 
community.  The study was fielded at the height of the economic recession in the [LOCATION_002]).  
Homelessness Risk Factors:  After the community input prioritized inclusion of homeless populations, and after the prioritization of employment status and expansion of the sample to 
accommodate studying employment, the partnership determined that it would be important to 
track homelessness and risk factors for homelessness owing to the inclusion of this group and the 
possibility that agencies serving the homeless might be able to do so more effectively und er the 
community engagement intervention model.  To this end, measures were included, similar to life 
Page 29 of 72 
 stress event items, of the presence or absence in the prior six months of 4 factors:  Either being 
currently homeless or  living in a shelter or having mul tiple risk factors  for homelessness , 
including no place to stay for 2 or more nights; being concerned about not having enough to eat (food insecurity), severe financial crisis, and eviction from major place of residence.  These were 
combined into a simple count as a prioritized secondary outcome, from community interest.   
 
QI (PIC/WE Care)  implementation.  We will assess a variety of implementation processes , 
including provider/staff exposure to training, specific implementation plans of intervention 
planning councils, depression QI toolkit adaptation, use of treatment protocols by [CONTACT_15098], care 
managers, coaches, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and strategies to sustain or spread implementation, through 
reports by [CONTACT_475413], contact [CONTACT_475414], session reports of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], council action plans and updates, and monthly 
reports (see Pearson et al 2005).

Sampling and Nonresponse Weights:   We will create weights to account for the sampling design 
as well as for response. For example, weights at the provider level will be created as products of sample selection weights at the organizational unit and provider level, and response weights, 
which will be modeled based on logistic regressions of response indicators on provider 
characteristics
149, [ADDRESS_609531] 
methods for variance estimation including generalized estimating equations or sandwich variance 
estimators)152-154  a main analytical tool in PIC. We will use software that facilitates analysis of 
data from complex sample designs, such as STATA, SUDAAN, PRO C ROBUSTREG in SAS 
V9, and SAS macros developed by [CONTACT_475415].150   
Missing Data:  Missing data  can result in  response bias. It is known that mixed- effects models 
handle cases with incomplete follow-up based on an implicit missing- at-random assumption.[ADDRESS_609532] models drop participants  from analyses when 
any explanatory variable is missing.  In CPIC, we will use multiple imputation techniques to account for missing data and the uncertainty in the imputed values.
155, 156  The analytic team has 
extensive experience with multiple imputation.157-159 In line with our earlier findings about the 
sensitivity of inferences to underlying data distributions,158 we will consider hot-deck and model-
based imputation, relying on hot-deck strategies when data distributions are highly skewed but leaving open the possibility of handling several variables simultaneously using model- based 
strategies if data distributions appear suitably behaved.
  
Analytic Strategies :  Our analysis uses an intent- to-treat (ITT) framework. To improve the 
precision of the estimate d intervention effect, we will conduct a series of bivariate analyses to 
Page 31 of 72 
 identify the potential covariates to be considered for a multiple regression model.  Confounding 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_475416]. We will use model -building strategies to obtain final models.160  
Assumptions of normality will also be evaluated.  For example, we will explore various 
transformations (e.g., log and square root) for life event variables due to the often skewed 
distribution  of event counts.  Smearing estimates will be used, if necessary, for retransformation, 
applying separate factors for each intervention group to ensure consistent estimates.161, [ADDRESS_609533] will hav e a very skewed distribution, either because 
there will be many zeros (e.g. sick days) and/or because the distribution of observed values has a 
very long tail (e.g. services utilization).  In such cases, we will draw upon statistical models 
developed for handling these type of data, in particular a two -part model to separately handle 
zero values and a skewed distribution among non- zeros161 Tobit- type sample selection  models163; 
split-sample techniques to distinguish between different functional forms and to avoid 
overfitting161; and dynamic models, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_475376], duration analysis, 
and count models.164, 165  
Multiple Comparisons:   We will address multiple comparisons by [CONTACT_475417]-hypothesis value of 0.5.  We will consider but will not rely solely on Bonferroni adjustments and related methods that incorporate bounds 
on the probability of a single false finding of significance.  We will also consider the false 
discovery rate (FDR)
166, a framework that offers more sensitive tests of significance when large 
numbers of tests are carried out by [CONTACT_475418] a uniform distribution.   
Hypotheses and Analysis Plans for Aim 2:  To examine the effects on client access to care, 
quality of care, and depression- related  outcomes.  
Hypothese s: We hypothesize that the community -engagement approach will lead to greater 
improvement over 6-12months in client’s access to  care, quality of care, and health outcomes 
than the technical assistance condition.  In underserved communities, greater participation in planning, which com munity engagement instills, is anticipated to improve uptake of health 
interventions.
34  Further, the community- engagement intervention utilizes many principles of 
social -science theory that support behavior change such as practice and skill development104, 124, 
Page 32 of 72 
 167; development of opi[INVESTIGATOR_46830],110 and stimulation of network development 118 and cross-
organizational “communities of practice” that promote identification with common goals and 
sharing of knowledge,119 improving capacity for implementation.   
 (NOTE:  Based on community input this hypothesis was modified to prioritize mental health-
related quality of life as the primary outcome because it represents both positive and negative 
mental health states, and then to separately examine both poor mental health and mental 
wellness as secondary outcomes; and to expand the include physical activity as both a social 
determinant of mental and physical health and especially relevant to elderly clients ; and also to 
include employment status, missed work days, and risk factors for homelessness as important outcomes.  Further, the concept of quality of care was modified to reflect, in addition to 
traditional indicators of use of antidepressant medication and/or counseling for depression, use 
of depression- related case management and counseling services in alternative community 
services sectors. Services us e was hypothesized to increase under the community engagement 
model relative to the technical assistance model)   
Overview :  The primary goal in this group- level randomized trial is to estimate the difference in 
effects on outcomes, between intervention arms (e.g., CE condition vs. low-intensity control). To 
test our main hypotheses (that CEP would be more effective than RS in improving client health 
outcomes and addressing community priorities for housing and employment, while likely 
increasing services ut ilization), we will conduct intent- to-treat, comparative effectiveness 
analyses using intervention status as the independent variable.  We will estimate logistic regression models for indicator variables and loglinear models for counts.  Consistent with 
recommendations for group- level trials, (8) main models will incorporate adjustment for baseline 
status of dependent variables and covariates: age, sex, >=3 chronic conditions, education, race/ethnicity, family poverty, [ADDRESS_609534]- level 
169 imputation.  Estimates and p -values are calculated using SUDAAN 
(http://www.rti.org/sudaan/) taking into account clustering within programs and weighting.  We 
supplement findings from adjusted models with result s from raw data to assess robustness.  We 
will use two -sided tests with p<.05 for statistical significance.

We will also apply multilevel models to clinician data, with clinicians taking on the role 
of “individuals.”   
The primary outcome comparisons will b e based on client mental health -related quality 
of life  and an  indicator of probable depression (see Table 2).  U sing the clients’ baseline and 6 -
month follow-up data, we will evaluate the CE intervention effects on primary mental health 
outcomes, and community priorities/secondary outcomes of physical activity, homelessness risk 
factors and employment, indicators of quality of care (use of antidepressant medications and 
healthcare counseling for depression) and services use in all community services sector s.  We 
will take into account the clustered design for a group-randomized trial.  W e will treat the 
intervention condition as the primary predictor in an intent- to-treat framework .  For a given 
outcome variable, we will include the baseline measure for that variable as a covariate along with demographic and baseline variables and stratification variables from the study design for 
additional adjustment.  We will also control for other baseline characteristics and stratification 
variables.  To examine intervention effects using longitudinal data (6 and 12 months), we will 
add individual-level random effects to account for repeated measurements within individuals and 
include interactions between time and the intervention indicator variable.    
Power for 6-Month  Client Outcomes Analyses  
Page [ADDRESS_609536] in comparing two group means is a function of the cluster 
size (m), the number of clusters (J), and the intra -class correlation (ICC), the ratio of the 
between -cluster  variability between  clusters to the total variability. In our application where 
cluster is organization unit, we use Kish’s method176, [ADDRESS_609537] errors by [CONTACT_475419] (VIF) defined as VIF=1+(m -1)×ICC, where ICC is the intra -class 
correlation at the organization unit level.  For analysis of repeated measures, we use an extended 
formula accounting for inter -temporal correlations within individuals and within units177  Based 
on PIC data, outcome analyses on depression care and clinic outcomes have shown that the ICC at the clinic level is either absent or around 0.01, and inter- temporal correlation coefficients 
within individuals and within units over a 12-month time period are greater than 0.60.  PIC provider data shows that ICCs are nearly absent for provider experience and around 0.00-0.[ADDRESS_609538], we 
use degrees of freedom equal to (number of clusters – 2) when ICC>0, which is  conservative for 
assessing significance, although we als o explore setting degrees of freedom equal to N-2 
(N=total sample size) for the scenario where ICC=0 (the optimistic scenario).  We also note that 
regression analyses adjusting for baseline covariates and stratification variables can improve 
statistical po wer if covariates explain a substantial portion of the uncertainty.
177  All power 
analyses are conducted with power of 80% or above as adequate, assuming two- sided tests with 
significance level 0.05.  For client data, we provide detailed power analysis for two primary study variables ( appropriate depression care and probable depression). 
Our initial power analyses were based on assumptions about effect sizes derived from 
prior studies of primary care patients, including ethnic minority patients, and that the main 
intervention effect wou ld be related to increasing rates of treatments for depression.  During the 
partnered design year, as the community leaders requested inclusion of especially vulnerable populations and services sectors for inclusion expanded, for example to faith-based age ncies, 
senior centers, homeless -serving providers, and prisoner-reentry programs, and outcomes were 
added such employment, we revisited our estimates of power.  First, to accommodate the interest 
Page [ADDRESS_609539] sizes might not be as large as planned, because of the greater 
difficulty in improving outcomes in complex populations.  We therefore decided to assume that 
we needed approximately a n increase in enrolled sample relative to our proposed sample for 
adequate power under more conventional conditions for fielding quality improvement interventions.  These adjustments are given in the Table 3 below, including power for originally 
proposed sample based on prior primary care studies; power for the analysis of the same sample 
to address employment; and then based on revised assumptions, prior to any recruitment, to 
capture smaller effect sizes expected for a more clinically and socially vulnerable sample with 
potentially higher attrition rates. After the participatory design phase, the final study was 
designed to have a power of .80 with an alpha of .05 (two-sided) and ICC=.00-.[ADDRESS_609540] group difference of 10% to 11% or higher in comparing two proportions and standardized effects size of .20 -.22  or higher in comparing two means. Enrolling 557-600 participants per 
condition (1114-1200 in total) allowed a retention rate of 65-70% at [ADDRESS_609541] sizes for main analyses (80% power (alpha=0.05), two -sided test)*

6. CPIC 3 -Year extension  (PCORI award # 1845) 
Background:   Depression is a leading cause of morbidity with disparities in care.  Depression 
collaborative care, a team -based approach supporting care management, patient activation and 
evidence -based treatments, is effective relative to usual care but o ften unavailable in under-
resourced communities.  Community Partners in Care (CPIC) randomized 95 programs in healthcare and community -based (e.g., social services, faith -based) service sectors in two 
communities to Resources for Services (RS) for individual program technical assistance versus 
Page 37 of 72 
 Community Engagement and Planning (CEP) for multi-sector coalition support for depression 
collaborative care.  For depressed clients, CEP relative to RS reduced having poor mental health-
related quality of life (MHRQL ) and behavioral health hospi[INVESTIGATOR_308998] 6-12 months. Longer-
term outcomes are unknown. 
Aims:   This extension study of CPIC aims to: 
1. Compare CEP and RS effects at 3 -year follow -up, 2-years after intervention support, on 
primary (depression and MHRQL ), community -prioritized outcomes of physical health -related 
quality of life (PHRQL) and behavioral health hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and outpatient services use (secondary); 
2. Compare effects of CEP and RS at 6, 12, and 36 months for CPIC participants enrolled in 
healthcare or community -based service sectors;  
3. Describe outcome priorities for African American and Latino depressed clients, and as 
perceived by [CONTACT_39487]. 
4. Describe views of stakeholders planning the Los Angeles County Health Neighborhood 
Initiative  (HNI) informed by [CONTACT_405905]; and national stakeholders briefed on CPIC and HNI. 
We hypothesized that CEP relative to RS would improve long- term mental and physical health 
and reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475377], overall and within sector.  We expected stakeholders to 
prioritize social factors and mental health.  
Methods:   Extension Study (Aims 1 -3): Between 1/2014-10/2014, we approached 1004 CPIC 
clients initially screened as depressed from 89 programs and eligible for 3-year surveys; 600 
participated (60%; RS 293, CEP 307). Aim 3: For client qualitative interviews, we approached 
163 consecutive 3- year survey participants stratified by [CONTACT_73789], race/ethnicity, gender and 
intervention; 104 participated (64%).  For staff, we notified 289 completing 12 month surveys and used purposive follow-up stratified by [CONTACT_29436], service sector and intervention, to 
complete 51 interviews.  Aim 4:  We interviewed 49 county and community leaders planning HNI and 14 of 34 leaders attending a national briefing. 
Data Sources:  Self -report surveys (Aims 1 and 2) and semi-structured interviews (Aims 3 and 
4). 
Measures:   Client outcomes are poor MHRQL (MCS-12 ≤ 40) and depression (PHQ-8≥10) 
(primary); PHRQL (12 -item physical composite score (PCS -12), mental wellness, and 
behavioral- health hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475377] (community -prioritized); and use of outpatient services 
Page 38 of 72 
 (secondary).  Clients and providers were asked about priorities for care and national stakeholders 
for responses to CPIC findings and related policy initiatives. 
4-year follow-up of the 3-year sample (extension study).   
The CPIC 4 -year follow -up was added based on community-stakeholder input that 
additional follow-up of the 3- year sample was desired to show longer- term effects on depression 
remission .  This follow-up built on the 3-year extension study as we ll as an opportunity to 
explore of using an existing funded cohort to recruit potential subjects into the Community and 
Patient Partnered Rese arch Network (CPPRN).   
Analyses  plan:  We will conduct 3- year end -status intent- to-treat analyses, and for 4- year 
follow-up of the 3- year sample, 4 -year end status, w ith intervention status as the main 
independent variable, adjusted for baseline status and covariates, with response weights and multiple imputation (Aim 1); subanalyses of intervention effects within service sector at each 
follow- up (Aim 2); sensitivity a nalyses (raw data, longitudinal modeling and sector- by-
intervention interactions); and thematic analyses of qualitative data (Aims 3 and 4)  
 
7. Limitations  
The proposed study is based in two under-resourced communities in Los Angeles; findings may not nece ssarily apply to other communities. Other limitations include the group -level randomized 
design, which is quasi- experimental. We rely on self -report measures and for this analysis 6 -
month client outcomes.  This remains an ambitious study in terms of design and scope in the 
context of a partnered research approach.   
 
8. Protection of Human Subjects  
8.1. RISKS TO THE SUBJECTS  
8.1a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
The proposed research will involve five groups of human subjects, agencies/administrators; 
clinicians/case workers; clients of these clinicians, and community members and civic leaders, 
and the research team itself.  The study is a randomized controlled trial of a community -
engagement, network building implementation intervention versus a low- intensity dissemination 
approach using a conference and access to a website with Partners in Care (PIC) toolkits.  The 
Page [ADDRESS_609543] intervention training for controls supported by [CONTACT_475420].  
Communities:  We selected by [CONTACT_475421], low-income, and largely uninsured and predominantly minority 
populations, for which we had established partnerships.   
Agencies:  We will contact [CONTACT_475422] (66 to date, 2 more to be completed; plus 10 attending the 
Feedback Conference).  We will ask them to participate in a websurvey in which we will identify 
other potential partners.  We expect 15-[ADDRESS_609544] one full -time equivalent clinicians/case work ers 
that serve adults; and to provide the number of eligible clinicians or case workers in those locations.  These units will be the focus of clinician recruitment (see below).  We expect most 
participating agencies to have [ADDRESS_609545] to identify 150 -200 
eligible units across agencies.  
All participating agencies’ eligible units (150 -200) will be considered for selection into 
the main trial.  We will select a stratified sample, by [CONTACT_475423], to achieve 50 -60 participating 
units (25-30 per community) for the main study, but expect to have another 25-30 participate in the ongoing administrator and clinician surveys but not in the main study.  
Among the participating organizational units, we will randomly assign them (stratified by 
[CONTACT_475424]) to participation in the 2 study conditions; for very large, well-
Page 40 of 72 
 established, multi-agency networks (such as QueensCare), we may randomize units within that 
network to preserve network ties.  Agencies and organizational units will be informed of their 
randomization status by [CONTACT_475425]’s Phase [ADDRESS_609546] units in both Phase 1 intervention conditions in the trial, and for this purpose, will identify a lead administrator for that agency for each intervention condition, and ask the 
additional administrator to complete the baseline administrator survey.  This will increase the 
admin istrator pool across the 80 CPIC agencies to about 100. 
All agencies will be asked to commit to participate in the administrator/agency web 
surveys, clinician surveys, and Feedback Conference.  Agencies selected for the main trial will 
be asked to send 1-[ADDRESS_609547] training after the main trial.  
Agencies/units assigned to community engagement implementation will participate in 4 
months of planning and training for use of PIC/WE Care and to design an approach to fit the programs to their resources, priorities, and sites, with support of community members serving as 
co-intervention planners.  Then they will participate in 12-18 months of implementing PIC/WE 
Care, including training the clinicians within participating units and sup porting access to 
evidence -based treatment treatments for depressed clients enrolled into a client study.  Those 
assigned to low-intensity, standard dissemination will attend a conference and have access to PIC toolkits on a website, but will not be asked to participate in other intervention planning or 
implementation at that time.  Agencies/units in both conditions will be asked to participate in 
client enrollment within each unit, designed to achieve screening of a defined client pool for 
depression and enrollment of several depressed clients for each unit into baseline surveys and 6-
month and 12-month follow-up surveys.  In community- engagement practices, those clients will 
be identified to the practice so that they can initiate PIC/WE Care intervention activities to facilitate access to evidence-based depression treatments, following the approach developed 
within their implementation planning period.  Following the 6-month outcomes data collection 
for the client study, the agencies in the community engage ment condition will be asked to 
identify representatives to participate in collaborative analyses and preparation of findings for presentation at the Community Feedback Conference, attended by [CONTACT_475426], to 
Page [ADDRESS_609548] training for controls.  
Administrators:  The administrator sample will be recruited from all participating CPIC 
agencies (see above), including those from the original respondents to the Community 
Partnership Initiative, those for agencies joining CPIC after being nominated for inclusion (i.e., 
primary care and specialty care partners of social service agencies in CPIC), and the additional 
lead administrators for those agencies with units in both Phase [ADDRESS_609549] 
100 administrators in the study.   Administrators will be asked to complete baseline, 12-month, 
24-month, and 36-month follow-up websurveys on behalf of their agency, and to participate in 
the other relevant  study activities f or their agency, see above.  
Clinicians:  We will ask administrators to complete a form for each selected unit for the 
study within their agency (see above), listing the number of full-time providers of services to 
adults within that unit.  Using lists of providers we will select 5 at random, using other providers 
(including part time or 50% working clinicians) for replacements as needed, using random 
selection from the remainder.  We will send recruitment packets with follow -up telephone 
contact/fax, and as needed, and for larger agencies make presentations to units to explain the study.  Clinicians/case workers will be asked to complete a baseline websurvey on the 
background and knowledge of and treatment practices for depression.  All cl inicians will be 
asked to participate in follow-up websurveys at 12, 24, and [ADDRESS_609550] about 200 -
250 clinicians/case workers to enroll in the units participating in the main trail and another 100-150 in nonparticipating units. 
Clinicians in units assigned to the main study will be asked to participate in the client 
outcomes study. One or two clinicians for each participating unit will be identified by [CONTACT_475427] “lead” clinicians for purpose of participating in planning and assuming roles of 
trainers of other clinicians in interventions.  These lead clinicians will be nominated by [CONTACT_475428], not selected by [CONTACT_1758] . The lead clinicians for their unit, may be asked by [CONTACT_475429] -off Community Conference and Feedback Community Conference.  
Page 42 of 72 
 Lead clinicians (and key administrators) may be asked to participate in semi-structured 
interviews about impl emen tation at the end of the trial.  
When participating in the community engagement intervention (initial trial or wait- list 
period for controls after main trial), clinicians/case workers will be asked to participate in 
PIC/WE Care training activities relev ant to the scope of their practice (care managers, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], 
medication specialists, outreach workers, educations, etc.), using training materials from the study, with help from their agency’s lead clinician(s) and study investigators. 
Clinicians will be  free to participate or not in CPIC, and in the training activities, 
conferences, expert leader roles, and other activities of the project.  They will be able to select 
treatments with their clients or not use treatments.  There is no control by [CONTACT_475430].  Clinicians will not be paid for their participation but will receive token gift certificates or com parably small thank -you tokens. 
Clients:  The clients will be recruited from a consecutive sample of adults visiting each 
participating clinician/case worker, over a one to two month period for that site.  Agencies will 
be given fliers and other materials to advertise the study and screening days if they wish.  
Agency staff at the unit will ask clients if they would be interested in par ticipating in a research 
study in which the agency/clinic is participating.  If interested, the client will be referred to the study field interviewer.  The interviewer will ask the client to complete a screening survey.  
Clinicians can also refer to the study. We expect [ADDRESS_609551] 4200 to complete the screener survey.  This phase will not require 
written consent, because we will not obtain client identifiers.  Those with a positive depression 
score (840), which indicates probable (but not certain) depression, will be asked to consent to 
participate in a baseline assessment and two follow -up surveys at 6 and 12 months.  The client 
baseline survey will be completed on the same day at the agency /unit or, if this is not feasible for 
the client, in a follow -up telephone call from RAND survey staff.  An estimated [ADDRESS_609552] of local mental 
health agencies in case they perceive a need for care.  
Page 43 of 72 
 Clients from agency units/clinicians in the community engagement condition will be 
identified to their practice for initiation of the PIC/WE Care program, and clients will be given 
contact [CONTACT_19297] a care manager in the intervention group.  Depending on the scope of 
practice for the agency unit in which they were screened, clients may be asked to participate in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a strategy for education and referral, clinical assessment for depression, or counseling 
or medication management, and to work with a case manager for follow-up; for some of these 
activities, clients may be referred to other agencies within the intervention network, for example, 
to receive medication management or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  Clients and clinicians will 
be able to select their choice of treatments and fit them to client needs.  Clients will be able to 
select other resources available to them, outside of the study or network, or other services within 
the n etwork, and remain in the s tudy.  
Clients from agencies in the low -intensity dissemination condition (control) will be given 
the standard referral information and encouraged if they are concerned about their mental health 
or welfare to talk to their agency clinician or other provider.  Further, their participating CPIC 
clinician or case worker will have previously had exposure to PIC/WE Care materials, through 
an initial conference presentation and discussion and access to toolkits on the website. Clients 
from the low-intensity control will be able to receive medication or counseling supported 
through usual community services.  
Client participants in both intervention conditions will be asked to complete a follow-up 
telephone survey at [ADDRESS_609553] 
85% response at 6 months (N=500) and 80% at 12 months (N=470). 
Collaborating Institutions and Sites: The lead  collaborating institutions for the research will be 
RAND, UCLA, Healthy African American Families, QueensCare, and Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health.  In addition, research activities conducted by [CONTACT_464], and 
intervention activities by c ommunity providers, will occur in the participating agencies.  Because 
those agencies are not yet recruited, we cannot identify those agencies at this time.  Agencies recruited may have their own Internal Review Board, and we will support submissions of the 
study as needed to those IRBs, and otherwise these agencies will be asked to assign their IRB 
needs to RAND.  We will collect information on whether the organization has its own IRB for 
Page [ADDRESS_609554] only one institution 
as the sole IRB for that  pair of institutions.  For research not involving human tissues, requiring 
FDA approval, or involving UCLA HIPPA issues (i.e., involving UCLA patient records), the reviewing institution is RAND.  This policy went into effect September 1, 2006. Thus for CP IC, 
RAND will be the lead IRB; separate UCLA IRB review will not be required.  
Community Leaders and Advisors:  For intervention groups, key agency leaders 
participate in the [ADDRESS_609555] of Supervisors and the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office ([CONTACT_33749], and 
representatives from local neighborhood planning councils), as part of the advisory group for 
planning.  This addition of grass-roots community members and civic leaders, helps make the 
overall project a community -wide project, supports the community-engagement model, and 
builds community support for implementation.  These are public roles, but the participants are also research subjects because they will be asked to complete conference surveys; notes of 
planning meetings are project data; and training and planning meetings and conferences, may be 
attended by [CONTACT_475431].  For these activities, the community leaders and advisors are also 
research subjects and will be asked to sign a consent form for participation in the re search 
activities of the project.  Community members will be recruited for their advisory roles by [CONTACT_475432], through advertising among the community contacts for these roles.  
The Community members participating in these roles will rec eive thank -you stipends from the 
CBOs.  The civic leaders will be recruited from the mayor’s and Board of Supervisor offices (see support letters), with additional nominations from those offices and the lead CBOs, as they have 
broad knowledge of community leadership in their areas.  Civic leaders will not receive a stipend 
for participating, as it is assumed to be within the scope of their usual duties.      
Page 45 of 72 
  
Research Investigators and Staff: Project research investigators and staff participating in trainin g, 
implementation planning meetings, and conference activities including the collaborative research analyses of data with agency administrators, will also be research subjects as they will be 
involved in minutes from meetings and subject to observation and other qualitative data 
collection activities, just like the community members and civic leaders.  Those project staff 
serving in those collaborator/consulting roles with community agencies, will be asked to sign a 
consent form as a research participant, as in Witness for Wellness.  
8.1b. Sources of Materials  
Data Sources:  Data on agencies and units derives from reports from lead administrators from the 
pre-study Community Partnership Initiative and four longitudinal web-surveys at baseline, 12, 
24, and 36 follow-up.  Data on clinicians/case workers is obtained through four self- report web -
surveys at the same time points.  Data on clients is obtained through screening surveys with a 
follow- up baseline face- to-face or telephone- administered interview for th ose screening positive 
for depression; and, for enrolled depressed clients only, at 6-and12-month follow-up telephone interviews.  Other sources of data are minutes and action plans from planning meetings and 
conferences, field notes of conferences, meetin gs, and training sessions, before- after surveys for 
conference participants (for Kick -Off, Feedback, and Quality Assurance Conferences), and other 
qualitative interviews for the process evaluation, conducted periodically (such as at trial exit for 
administrators) as part of the implementation process evaluation.   
8.1c.  Potential Risks  
Administrators and Clinicians:  There is some minor risk of social harm (embarrassment) to administrators or clinicians due to the evaluation process (for example, through f eeling compared 
with other administrators or clinicians).  Also, there will be an increase in the caseloads of the providers in the intervention agencies, but a given provider will only have a few enrolled 
depressed patients in the study, that load is not great.  Thus, we think it unlikely that agencies 
will assume an undue burden in selecting the scope of implementation.  Over time, this may or 
may not translate into economic risk for the agencies or providers, since improved patient 
outcomes may well redu ce intensity of services over time for some clients, and increase it for 
others.   
Page 46 of 72 
 Providers will help define the implementation plans for use of service delivery 
interventions that support use of evidence-based treatments.  None of the treatments supported 
by [CONTACT_1758], and none of the service delivery interventions (PIC/WE Care), are new 
interventions; they are not “experimental” treatments or interventions, as their evidence -basis is 
already well -established.  Providers and clients are not mandated to us e particular treatments, 
i.e., they are assigned to resources to support care decisions, not mandated to particular 
treatments; and providers can refuse to use study materials and remain in the study, and clients 
can refuse treatments or select others, and  remain in the study.  Providers face potential 
malpractice suits for adverse treatment outcomes under usual practice, and while there is always a risk for an adverse treatment outcome (such as a side effect, or no treatment response), these 
are less likel y with evidence- based care, so if anything the overall chances of malpractice suits 
for treating depression should be less for providers supported by [CONTACT_475433]-based care strategies.  In the unlikely event that a malpractice claim is b rought (for example, 
because of a complication from medication), treating providers would be covered by [CONTACT_475434].  
Clients:  Potential risks to clients participating in this study, from the study itself, are 
minimal, and chiefly consist of the embarrassment of revealing personal information to a 
stranger or neutral party. There is also some risk that information on a mental health condition, if 
entered into the medical record or reported on an insurance claim form, could establish a history 
of a pre -existing condition making it more difficult to be covered by [CONTACT_475435], 
but only in some companies, should the client change jobs or try to change insurance.  Consents will suggest that clients disc uss such concerns with their providers, and providing training will 
alert providers to this standard concern in clinical practice.  The interventions will be in addition to the patient’s usual course of treatment, not a replacement for it, and clients can choose to use 
any study materials, such as the PIC client brochure, or use a treatment (such as Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy that was supported by [CONTACT_3449]-training of a community provider), or to not use 
these resources, and stay in the study.  Clients are not assigned to treatments, and all treatment 
decisions will be up to clients and the providers they choose to visit.  The client’s usual provider 
will continue to be responsible for treatment and will be responsible for application of the 
protocols, or providers to w hich the client is referred.  
Page 47 of 72 
 Because the treatments the study interventions support are not experimental, side effects 
from them (for example, normal side effects of antidepressant medications) experienced by 
[CONTACT_137190], would not be considered “adverse events” of the study itself, but expected side effects of 
standard practice treatments.   
We will collect data from the clients about lifetime and current depression and other 
psychiatric disorders (alcoholism, panic disorder, psychotic symptoms).  I f a life -threatening 
situation is encountered during screening, telephone interviews or other contact [CONTACT_475436], emergency protocols similar to those developed for PIC will be followed.  Depending on 
whether the situation comes up in the agency/unit or through a study telephone interview, clients 
with an emergency will either be walked to a clinician in their agency and the study staff will 
assist the client in explaining the situation; or the telephone survey staff will contact [CONTACT_978] (or if 
an ur gent life -threatening situation, either contact [ADDRESS_609556] 
911, which greatly speeds up the response).  In over [ADDRESS_609557]; in the last (8 -
year) follow -up of PIC participants, there were no emergency events; but in tests of the PI’s 
response time through randomly selected times for calls, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_475378], with 2 minutes of the call from survey staff.  Thus, we are very 
experienced with facilitating activation of and effective use of an emergency response system for 
studies of depressed clients.   
Clients will be paid $20 for the baseline survey and $30 for the 6-month follow-up 
survey. Clients will receive a small gift certificate for completing the screener.  
Community Members, Civic Leaders, and Researchers:  For other participants in implementation 
planning and collaborative research activities, we expect individuals to agree to serve these roles 
who are comfortable with public visibility.  Community members will be supported in their roles 
by [CONTACT_475437].  Community members are in a more vulnerable position and will receive 
stipends for their roles by [CONTACT_475438], but ci vic leaders and researchers will not receive stipends.  
The main risks to these participants is embarrassment or insecurity in serving in a public role.  
 
8.2. ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
8.2a.  Recruitment and Informed Consent   
 
Page 48 of 72 
 Lead administrators from the participating agencies will be asked to review a description of 
CPIC on the web survey, and will review that description with appropriate leaders within their 
agency.  Agencies will submit a signed letter to initiate their participation.  The composition and 
recruitment procedures are provided in detail above, but briefly include agencies participating in the Community Partnership Initiative; and additional primary care and specialty care agencies 
identified by [CONTACT_475439].  There will be 80 
organizations that participate.  The organizations will be invited by [CONTACT_475440] a 
participating agency and the subsequent study activities.  Organizations will be free not to 
participate.  
Administrator s and Clinicians: We will ask each participating agency to identify 1 
administrator, supplemented in agencies with organizational units in both intervention 
conditions, by [CONTACT_475441], for an approximate sample 
of 100 administrators. Administrators identify organizational units with full time clinicians/case 
workers for adults, and these units will be arrayed by [CONTACT_475442] 50-[ADDRESS_609558] some clinicians participating in  units that are not selected for the study.  
Clinicians/Case Workers:   Using l ists of all full- time clinicians or case workers for adults 
within selected units, we will use recruitment packets and follow -up calls to recruit 5 clinicians 
per unit, replacing as necessary from remaining clinicians; and if necessary replacing units with  
others from the remaining nonselected pool.  In PIC, all but [ADDRESS_609559] 200-250 clinicians in the 60 main study units and another 100- 150 from 
other units.  Clinicians will be free to choose not to participate in the study or in particular activities of the study.  
Clients: We will recruit a consecutive sample of adult clients visiting participating 
clinicians, over a t wo week period for that site.  Following posting of notices for the study or 
sending fliers, the agency’s staff will ask their clients if they are interested in participating in a research project in which the agency is participating.  If the client is interested, he/she will be 
directed to see the RAND field staff person assigned to that agency.  We hope to talk to [ADDRESS_609560] with the participant and/or provide referrals to a specific 
doctor or clinic identified for this purpose within each geographical area.  During PIC telephone 
interviews there were no instances where interviewers encountered life- threatening physical 
health situa tions.  However, there were about [ADDRESS_609561] been recently suicidal (out of about 
[ADDRESS_609562]).  Following the approved protocol, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_475379] (usually within 24 hours or as soon as they could be reached by [CONTACT_756]) and 
discussed the situation.  In all instances, the patients were well aware of their options for 
treatment, all were in active treatment, and all were dis cussing their symptoms with their 
providers and felt they did not need additional assistance contact[CONTACT_475443].  Most subjects 
Page [ADDRESS_609563] the PI’s responsiveness by [CONTACT_475444], and the response to the telephone center was within 2 minutes over 10 calls. 
All patient- identifying information will be kept confidential.  RAND’s Survey Research 
Group (SRG) will use one set of identifiers (Field IDs) in their contacts with participants.  Our 
senior programmer will receive field data from SRG and transform the Field IDs to another set of IDs (Analytic IDs) before the data are available to the investig ators.  The file that links the 2 IDs 
will be secured and accessible only to the senior programmer and RAND’s privacy office.  Identifiable hard copy data will be maintained separately by [CONTACT_475445]-up surveys.  A 
detailed data safeguarding plan will be developed for the study and submitted to the IRBs at RAND and UCLA for approval.  See section on Data and Safety Monitoring Plan below. 
All field staff who interact with clients will receive at least [ADDRESS_609564] had 
treatments (and not gotten better), and for clinicians, administrators, and other participants, 
embarrassment, extra efforts, or for agencies, the possibility of increased costs; but all 
participants are free to participate or not in the study and activities within the study, and the 
study is designed to adjust implementation of the services delivery interventions to the priorities 
and resources of the agencies, and the treatment preferences of providers and clients. The more 
serious risks of clients having difficulty with insurance in future jobs from a history of treatment 
are rare compared to the common risks  of untreated depression.  Further the implementation 
strategy being studied, community engagement, is specifically designed to provide the empowerment and flexibility for participate meaningfully in social planning, such as improving 
healthcare delivery.  
Page 52 of 72 
 This study will provide several types of new knowledge: 1) the effectiveness of a 
community-engagement based implementation intervention relative to standard, low- intensity 
dissemination; 2) strategies that community agencies and members use to learn about 
implementing evidence -based interventions; and 3) the process of implementation of evidence-
based depression quality improvement programs in underserved communities of color.    
These knowledge gains for the field, will likely help develop a stronger focus on 
dissemination and implementation for a stigmatized  condition such as depression.We believe that 
the gains of the study, in terms of knowledge and substantive gains to the community, exceed the 
risks for participants.  
 
9. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The administrator and clinician website will be maintained by [CONTACT_14574].  Most of the data collected 
from administrators and clinicians will be entered into a secure web data base that is password 
protected.  Access to this data base will be limited to a se nior programmer and Ruth Klap, the 
data manager at UCLA.  Field IDs will be replaced with Analytic IDs before data are released for analysis. Contact [CONTACT_475446], to enable their contact [CONTACT_475447], conferences, etc. A program, such as PGP, that provides RSA level security will be used 
to encrypt files before sending them by [CONTACT_6968]. The passwords for encrypted files will be 
transmitted directly to the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_475380] (no messages will be left) or by 
[CONTACT_475448].  Hard copy administrator and clinician agreements and interview forms will be kept at 
RAND.  All client data will be maintained at RAND.  RAND will initiate all written contacts, 
telephone or other personal contact [CONTACT_20688]; UCLA initiates contact [CONTACT_475449] a web survey.  Hard 
copy administrator and clinician agreements a nd interview forms will be kept in locked file 
cabinets with limited access.  
The use of Web -based technology presents additional concerns in relation to loss of 
confidentiality. To ensure the security and integrity of our data, we use technology similar to that used to protect credit card information in e- commerce applications: all exchanges between a 
user's browser and the server are two-way encrypted with the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol to prevent eavesdroppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tampering, or data forgery. SSL protocols use 128-bit cryptography 
Page [ADDRESS_609565] protection. Different user profil es allow access to relevant sections of the database. For 
example, study clinicians can view and edit data on their own patients only. Investigators can see recruitment and intervention data for their study site and de- identified summary data for all study  
sites for comparison.  For additional security of the data, we use only unique study identification numbers to identify study patients on data forms, and we do not transmit patients' names, 
medical record numbers, or other identifying information over the Internet.  
Hard copy patient participation agreements will be sent to the Survey Research Group at 
RAND on a weekly basis from each of the screening sites.  They will be logged in and put on-
line by [CONTACT_475450](s) and then stored in locked file cabin ets.  The screening forms will be 
sent to data entry after which the hard copy will be stored in locked file cabinets. Judy Perlman, SRG, will be responsible for the safeguarding of the hard copy of these forms while they are in 
the field and once the form s are at RA ND. 
Baseline surveys will be collected on laptop computers sing Computer Assisted Personal 
Interviewing (CAPI).  Access to the notebook computer will require a password.  An additional 
password will be required for access to the survey data.  Da ta will be transferred from the laptops 
to network drives with restricted access regularly.   The follow-up surveys will be conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CAPI) by [CONTACT_475451].  
This data will be safeguarded at  RAND.  Only de -identified data will be shared with UCLA.  
Worksheets, logs and call records that contain the patient names and RAND IDs used by 
[CONTACT_475452].  After the field period, the worksheets will be kept in locked file cabinets.  As much as 
possible, Field IDs will be used as identifiers on worksheets rather than patient identifiers. 
We will have an on -line file of patient names and telephone numbers during the data 
collection period.  This system will track the status of each patient and provider until the data 
collection is completed and will help in the scheduling of cases.  These files have access 
restricted by [CONTACT_475453] a need to use them to operate 
the study and who have signed the oath of confidentiality.  Judy Perlman will be responsible for 
safeguarding these files during the data collection period.  When data collection is completed, 
Page [ADDRESS_609566] read and write access restricted to Bernadette.  The analytic ID for 
participants and/or other RAND- assigned identifiers will replace the identifying information in 
all fields that would identify individuals or clinics be fore primary data are made available to the 
analysis team.  Following analysis, reports will be prepared.  These reports will not contain any 
data that could identify individual clients or providers. 
The raw data and the computer data files will be kept fo r at least one year following the 
publication of the final reports on the study.  Upon the completion of the study, the link files, and 
the survey data files will be turned over to the RAND Privacy R esource Team for safeguarding.  
Employees who will be handling any participant-identifying computer files, worksheets, 
or medical record information as well as the survey interviewers and their supervisor will sign an 
oath of confidentiality.  As part of their training, they will be instructed in the rules of 
confidentiality and data safeguarding for the study. 
Process for Handling and Reporting Adverse Events (AEs):  If an AE in the nature of 
threat to harm self or others occurs in the agency during the screening, consenting, baseline 
survey interaction, the client’s provider or a provider designated by [CONTACT_475454]’s consent.  Events occurring during telephone interviews with clients will be 
reported to the SRG supervisor who will immediately contact [CONTACT_079], [CONTACT_475506] or a project clinician designated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wells ([CONTACT_475507], [CONTACT_475508]).  [CONTACT_240617] (or a 
designated backup clinician) will be always on call during the field period.  [CONTACT_240617] decides 
how the event is to be handled (e.g., phones a suicidal patient, reports elderly abuse).  When the 
event is resolved, [CONTACT_240617] will write a summary of the occurrence and submit it to the IRB.  
The IRB determines whether further notification is warranted.  
Data Safeguarding and Management Board (DSMB):  The DSMB is charged  as an external, 
independent oversight board, to monitor the conduct of the study for ongoing feasibility, data 
integrity and safety. NIMH has its own DSMP for clinical trials.  If determined that the study 
requires a DSMP, we will use the NIMH DSMP.  Howe ver, we think this study may not require 
a DSMP.  The reason is that it is a randomized, controlled trial of an intervention to implement 
Page [ADDRESS_609567] dissemination approach.  Neither approach increases patient 
risks appreciably in that they both support improved treatment approaches if implemented.  The 
study does not promote use of new treatments or unproven treatments, except for the value of the 
implementation approach itself, which is directed at a network and organizational unit level. 
If recommended for DSMP, CPIC will work with the selected DSMB members identified 
by [CONTACT_52042]; they will be selected to have appropriate expertise and no conflic ts of interests. These 
members will monitor the study and ensure that monitoring is timely and effective. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_475381], respond to any DSMB queries or suggestions and submit 
the DSMB reports to all IRBs after DSMB meetings . 
Data to be Reviewed:  Prior to the start of the study, the board would review the protocol and 
overall plans for data and safety monitoring. The board then will review patient flow and subject 
entry to ensure adequate recruitment and retention of subjects and will monitor the occurrence of 
adverse events related to participation in the protocol. However, we point out that the main 
adverse events relevant to a study of this nature, are likely to be either expected complications of 
depression or of treatments.  Overall in clinical trials of depression, adverse events may include: 
deaths, suicide attempts, study dropout, psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and clinical deterioration 
defined as emergent suicidal or plan, development of serious substance abuse, or eme rgence of a 
new psychiatric or medical diagnosis or behavior posing significant risk to the subjects or others.   
Relative to clinical treatment trials, this study has infrequent monitoring of patients and is 
mainly able to identify clinical problems at the time of the subject being in a screening visit when a social service worker or clinician will be present; and at telephone follow -up, when 
emergency procedures are handled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_475382].  During main community- wide implementation, community organizations are implementing the protocols 
under their own priorities and resources, and the study does not monitor their patient care, except through a sample of clients in the second cross- sectional survey, i.e., it is real community 
implementation, and that phase is not randomized.  This study is more like a “fifth” or “sixth” 
level trial, and is not of treatment per se, or services delivery per se, but of implementation of 
evidence -based interventions at these levels.  
Page 56 of 72 
 Schedule of Meetin gs: If recommended for a DSMB, we suggest teleconferences for the 
meetings, once in the first year; at [ADDRESS_609568] predominantly minority participants at the client level; 2/[ADDRESS_609569] will use bilingual interviewers 
and all instruments will be available in English and in Spanish.

prior to study initiation  in 3/18/2008. HSPC id: w2812-06-01; Federalwide Assurance number 
(FWA):  FWA00003425; IRB number: IRB00000051.   
Page 58 of 72 
  
Client components including informed consent forms for screener, enrollment, baseline, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up were approved in 10/22/2009 through 10/21/2010 (w2812-06-01-CR02), with extensions through 10/3/2014 (w2812-0601-AM09, w2812-06-01-CR03, w2812-06-01- CR04 , w2812-06-01-CR05, w2812-06-01- CR06 ).   
 Partner agencies approved the referenced research by [CONTACT_475457] , 
or if requiring their own IRB, through approval by [CONTACT_11577], prior to client recruitment at their 
agency .  For agencies with their own IRB, the IRB focused on initial client recruitment into the 
study.  The initial consents covered screening for eligibility and enrollment in the trial, including 
baseline through 12-month follow-up, in the enrollment consent. A ll longer- term follow-up 
human subjects approval was through RAND IRB with the recruited clients .   
   Three-year extension was approved by [CONTACT_475458] 10/3/2014 through 10/3/2016 (w2812-06-01-CR07, w2812-06-01- CR08 ). An amendment was approved in 2/29/2016 (w2812-06-01- AM25)  
for contact[CONTACT_425698] 600 CPIC clients who completed the 36-month follow-up interviews by [CONTACT_648], for the 4 -year follow -up survey and enrollment into a new program (CPPRN).

 A1. Analytic Sample  
Enrollment  
The study settings were South Los Angeles and Hollywood- Metro. Participant sampling 
(program and client recruitment) and randomization are described in greater detail in prior 
publications. Within enrolled programs, clients were screened for eligibility in waiting rooms 
(consecutive selection) or events (random selection) between March 2010 to November 2010 by 
[CONTACT_475464]. Staff 
approached 4 ,645 adults (age ≥18) ove r 2-3 days per program; 4440 (96%) agreed to screening. 
Study eligibility was limited to clients providing contact [CONTACT_475465] a 
score of 10 or greater on a modified 8- item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -8) (3). Of 4 ,440 
screened, 1 ,322 (30%) were eligible and 1246 (94%) consented. In our previous publications,(1 -
3) we created enrollment weights based on propensity weighting adjustment, by [CONTACT_475466]. The reciprocal of the predicted 
response probability was used as the enrollment weight for each participant. See Supplementary 
Materials in  publications. 1-5 
Telephone survey 
Baseline survey.  Between April 27, 2010-January 2, 2011, we approached 1,246 
consented clients for baseline telephone survey conducted by [CONTACT_475467] 981 clients (79% of 1246 consented, RS: 492, CEP: 489) completed the baseline, 36 refused (RS: 17, CEP: 19), [ADDRESS_609574] (RS: 96, CEP: 131), and 2 deceased 
(RS: 1, CEP: 1). 
[ADDRESS_609575] 11, 2011, we 
approached 1093 participants (RS: 540, CEP: 553) for 6-month follow-up telephone survey; [ADDRESS_609576] because their bas eline survey response 
status was in one of following categories: final refusal, ill or incarceration, unable to contact, or deceased. Of 1093 attempted for 6-month follow-up, N=759 (69% of attempted, RS: 380, CEP: 
359) completed the survey, 12 refused (RS: 3, CEP: 9), [ADDRESS_609577] (RS: 157, 
CEP: 164), and 3 deceased (RS: 1, CEP: 2).  
12 month follow- up survey.  Between May 10, 2011 and March 12, 2012, we approached 
974 participants for 12-month follow-up telephone survey; 272 enrolled participants were not 
attempted for 12-month follow-up based on their baseline or 6 month survey status. Of 974 
A-3 
 attempted for 12-month follow-up, N=733 (75% of attempted, RS: 364, CEP: 369) completed 
the survey, 7 refused (RS: 4, CEP: 3), [ADDRESS_609578] (RS: 109, CEP: 120), and 5 
deceased (RS: 3, CEP: 2).  
3 year follow -up survey (extension study). Between 1/14/2014 and 10/14/2014, we 
attempted to contact 1004 participants for 36-month follow-up with exclusion who deceased 
(RS: 4, CEP: 4), who made final refusal in previous wave (RS: 22; CEP: 27), or who had no data 
on baseline, 6, and 12 months (RS: 84; CEP: 101).  Of 1014 attempted for 36-month follow-up, 
600 (600/1014=59%) participated (RS 293, CEP:307), 24 were deceased (RS:14, CEP:11), 10 
refused  (RS:7, CEP:3), 3 were too ill/incapable (RS:2, CEP:1), and 367 (RE:180, CEP:186) were 
not able to be reached. 
4-year follow-up of the 3-year sample (extension study).  The CPIC [ADDRESS_609579], the Community and Patient Partnered 
Research Network (CPPRN).  Between 3/31/2016 and 5/26/2016, we attempted to contact 598 
clients (RS: 292, CEP: 306) who completed CPIC 3 years interview participants excluding 2 that declined follow-up (RS 1, CEP 1). The telephone interview took about 15-20 minutes. At the end 
of the interview, a respondent was asked “Would you like to hear about the CPPRN program?” 
and “do you agree to be part of the CPPRN?” if answered ‘yes’.  Of those, 283 (47.3%) 
participated (RS 143, CEP 140), with 308 not reached (RS 143, CEP 165), 1 deceased (RS 1, 
CEP 0) , 5 refused (RS 5, CEP 0), and 1 too ill to participate (RS 0, CEP 1).

A2. Weighting 
Enrollment The enrollment weight was intended to make the enrolled sample (n=1,246) 
representative of a specific target population. 6, 7  That target population was defined as people 
who were: age [ADDRESS_609580] the 
enrollment among those eligible.  The reciprocal of the predicted response probability was used 
as the enrollment weight for each participant.  Five versions of the enrollment weight were 
created corresponding to five imputed screener data, because imputed predictors from the 
A-4 
 screener data were used in fitting logistic regressions.  Common predictors of age, community, 
and type of programs were used in all models. 
Attrition  The analytic sample for 6 months is comprised of 1,018 participants who completed 
baseline, or 6-month telephone follow-up surveys.  We used nonresponse weighting to address missing data for subjects who did not who did neither complete baseline nor 6 months follow-up 
telephone surveys.  We started with a large set of independent categorical variables to be 
considered for a logistic regression on the outcome of response among enrolled participants.  The 
final model included predictors that were significant ( p<0.05) for either intervention arm (age, 
gender, ethnicity, living situation, income, US born), as well as for two design variables (community and sector of the screening program).  The final weights defined on the analytic 
sample were the product of the two adjustment factors for enrollment and nonresponse. See 
Supplementary Materials in  publications. We applied the weights to the 36-month outcome 
analysis excluding 24 deceased cases (1,004 attempted - 24 deceased = 980). The weights for 3-year main analysis defined on the analytic sample were the product of the two adjustment factors 
for enrollment and nonresponse. See Supplementary Materials in previous publications. 
1-[ADDRESS_609581] follow-up status from 3- year sample included screener 
sector, age, education, working for pay, PCS-12, poor mental health- related quality of life at 
baseline, and risk for homelessness at 3 years.  
 
A3. Multiple Imputation  
Item-level Missing Data  We used an extended hot deck multiple imputation technique to impute 
missing values for item-level nonresponse. 8, 9  The procedure was based on cycling through each 
missing -data pattern on each variable with incomplete items.  This m ethod involved two steps: 1) 
forming imputation classes based on the predicted mean of the variable being imputed from a multiple regression model, and 2) drawing imputations at random from observed data within 
each class based on an approximate Bayesian b ootstrap.  To reflect the uncertainty of donor cells 
we created bootstrap weights and then used the product of the bootstrap weights in the multiple imputation model.  Five imputed datasets were created.  Each of the imputed data sets differs by 
[CONTACT_475468] 
A-[ADDRESS_609582] variables had item -level missingness rates  of less than 5% except 
for base line income and MINI variables.  With imputations stratified by [CONTACT_475469], 5 
alternative imputed datasets were produced for screener, baseline, 6 month, 12 month, and 3 year 
follow-ups, and multiple imputation infere nces were used in all analysis . 10, 11   
The approach for selecting variables for multiple regression models was intended to 
preserve the associations and relationships among variables.  In general, we identified common 
predictors for all imputation models  including design variables (community, type of programs), 
social demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, living situation, income, and working status), and PHQ- 8 score.  For baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and three 
year d ata, baseline health variables (count of chronic medical conditions, PCS12 and MCS12) 
were included.  In addition to these common predictors, each imputation model also included 
other predictors to be used in later analyses of interest. The order in which variables were 
imputed was determined based on a judgment of the analytic importance of the variables and the 
degree of missing data. Earlier imputed values were used during subsequent imputation steps, 
implying some dependence on the order in which variables were imputed.  
Unit-Level Multiple Imputation
 We used a hot deck multiple imputation procedure based on an 
approximate Bayesian bootstrap method for unit- level missing data.  12, 13  This model assumes 
that both missingness and dropout arise from mechani sms that are missing at random (MAR) in 
the sense defined by [CONTACT_11369].  Our imputation techniques attempted to include information related 
to the missing values whenever possible.  We first modeled the propensity of response at a given 
time point (coded 1 if response and 0 if nonresponse).  In Step 2, we stratified cases based on the 
quintiles of the propensity scores and used the approximate Bayesian bootstrap to select donors. In practice these procedures were applied in sequence for the baseline, 6 -month, 12-month, and 
3-year data, with imputations stratified by [CONTACT_475470].  We started with imputing 
baseline.  For each of the 5 item- level imputed screener datasets, we imputed a unit -level 
imputation baseline dataset.  Limited to the analytic s ample of 1 ,018, we then used baseline 
variables as predictors for modeling 6 and 12-month follow-up data and produced unit- level 
imputation datasets.  In modeling the logistic regression of predicting response propensities, we 
started with a large set of i ndependent variables.  The final baseline model included the 
predictors: age, gender, ethnicity, income, living situation, US born, community, and type of 
A-6 
 screening program.  The 6 -month models included participants characteristics assessed at 
screener (ag e, gender, ethnicity, health insurance, and type of screening program.), and baseline 
clinic and service variables (multiple chronic conditions, alcohol abuse or use of illicit drugs, any 
depression care).  The 12-month models included additional variables: community, PHQ-8 
assesses at screener, mental wellness, homeless status at baseline.   The 3 years models included 
age, gender, ethnicity, employment status, ≥[ADDRESS_609583] 6 months, type of 
screening program, and community with additional stratum variable sector (social-community 
screening sector vs healthcare Screening Sector) in Step 2.  Values for participants who were 
deceased were no t imputed.  
 A4. Analyses 
For all study components (including supplement components discussed below), we convened working groups co- chaired by [CONTACT_475471], data 
output and discuss findings. Analyses for 6-month outcome: 
We conducted intent- to-treat, comparative -effectiveness  
analyses with  intervention status as the  independent variable, using logistic regression for 
dichotomous measures and Poisson regression models for count variables.  Covariates were 
selected to account for known associations of sociodemographic and clinical status indicators 
with primary outcome measures .  We adjusted for baseline status of dependent variables  and 
covariates (age, sex, ≥[ADDRESS_609584] of 18, education, 
race/ethnicity, family income < federal poverty level, 12 -month alcohol abuse or use of illicit 
drugs at baseline, 12-month depressive disorder at baseline , and community).  All analyses were 
conducted using SUDAAN Version 10.0 (http://www.rti.org/sudaan/) and accounted for clusteri ng (clients within programs), weighti ng, and multiple imputations .  Significance of 
comparisons by [CONTACT_475472].  Results of logistic regression models are presented as odds ratios (OR) and Poisson models as rate ratios (RR) with 
95 % confidence intervals.  We illustrate results for intervention groups adjusted for covariates 
using standardized predictions generated from fitted regression models. 
14  We  present Cohen’s 
effect size index h, defined for dichotomous variables,15 where h=0.20 is small, h=0.50 is 
medium and h=0.80 is large.  We supplement adjusted models with unadjusted raw data to assess 
A-7 
 robustness.  We applied a Bonferroni adjustment considering two primary outcomes (Poor 
mental health qualify of life MCS -12<=40, and at least mild depression PHQ- 9>=10 ) and 
compared the proportion of results across outcomes favoring one intervention to an assumed 
null-hypothesis of 0.5. 
Analyses for 12-month outcome:  We conducted intent- to-treat analyses of repeated measures 
including all participants with available data at baseline, 6 -, or 12-months by [CONTACT_475473] 9.2 (SAS Institute).  We used a model -based approach with unweighted data.  Initial 
explorations of 3-level, random- effects logistic models using SAS PROC GLIMMIX  for binary 
outcomes yielded unstable estimates for program -speciﬁc random effects. 16, 17 
We analyzed dicho tomous and count outcomes by [CONTACT_475474] a generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) framework.  18 Speciﬁ cally, we ﬁtted logistic regression models for binary out-
comes and Poisson models for count data using SAS PROC GENMOD, specifying exchangeable correlation at the pro gram level, with regression  adjustment for baseli ne covariates (age, sex, 
>=3 chronic conditions, education, race/ethnicity, family poverty, alcohol abuse or use of illicit drugs in the past [ADDRESS_609585] 12 months, and community).  We 
then developed a contrast involving a linear combination of coefﬁcients to test intervention 
effects at each end point (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) and test ed differences between 
interven tion groups in change from baseline to 6 and 12 months. 
The results of analyses of binary outcomes are presented as odds ratios, and the results of 
Poisson regression analyses of count data are p resented as rate ratios.  We treated time as a 
continuous variable and examined the ﬁxed effects for time and intervention, and their 
interactions.  We included quadratic terms (squared effect of time and its interaction with the 
intervention) which allowed insight into whether changes are greater from baseline to [ADDRESS_609586] regression model by [CONTACT_475475].  We accounted for the multilevel 
data structure with clients nested within pro -grams and repeated meas urements nested within 
clients.  To account for the intraclass  correlation expected in the data, we speciﬁed random 
effects at the program  level and an autoregressive covariance structure within clients to account 
for within -client correlation over time.  
A-8 
 We conducted sensitivity analyses for alternative rep resentatio ns of time as a continuous 
or class variable and for alternative weighting approaches.  To investigate possible nonignorable 
effects,  we used 2 methods.  For continuous measures (such as MCS -12 and number of service 
visits), we multiplied igno rable-model i mputations alterna tively by 1.1 and 0.9 to reveal 
sensitivity to 10% departures from ignorable-model predictions with dichotomized versions of 
continuous measures (MCS- 12 <= 40) based on the imputed continuous value.  For categorical 
imputations where refe rence cells wer e based on an underlying continuous measure (that is, 
predicted response propensity) including an indicator for any utilization and adjusted Bayes ian 
bootstrap imputations reﬂecting unit nonresponse at a particular time point, nonignorable imputations for cases in nonboundary reference cells were generated by [CONTACT_475476]. 
19  We also conducted 12-month endpoint analysis controllin g baseline with weighting 
adjustment and presented standardized predictions. 2, 14 
Analyses for 3-year outcome: 
We conducted 3 years endpoint analysis controlling baseline with weighting adjustment (see analysis strategy for 6 months).  Giv en multiple secondary outcomes, 
19 we built on the false-
discovery- rate (FDR) framework  [ADDRESS_609587]-adjusted p values (pFDR) in interpreting results across a large number of 
regression analyses .  Results with pFDR <.[ADDRESS_609588] for the two primary outcomes, the community-prioritized outcomes, service use in t he 
health care sector, service use in the social -community sector, medication use, and summary 
utilization indicators.  
 We conducted a longitudinal sensitivity analysis using all waves of data (baseline, 6-months, 12-months, 3-years) without response weights, adjusting for baseline covariates as in the 
primary analysis.  We specified a spline model, with a linear segment between baseline and the 
first follow -up for initial improvement and another linear segment for the subsequent follow-ups; 
the two linear segments were speciﬁed to join at the ﬁrst follow-up.  In analyzing continuously 
scaled PCS -12 as the dependent variable, we used a 3- level, mixed -effects regression model by 
[CONTACT_475475].  To account for the intraclass correlation due to the multi level 
structure, we specified random effects at the program level and a spatial power covariance 
A-9 
 structure at the client level to account for unequal spacing of waves .  Initial explorations of 3-
level, random- effects logistic models using SAS PROC GLIMMIX for binary outcomes yielded 
unstable estimates for program -specific random effects.  We utilized a generalized estimating 
equation (GEE) framework  with logistic regression models for binary outcomes and Poisson 
models for counts using SAS PROC GENMOD, spec ifying exchangeable correlation at the 
program level.  From the estimated spline models, we developed a contrast involving a linear 
combination of coefficients to test intervention effects at each end point (baseline, 6-months, 12-
months, and 3- years) and tested differences between intervention groups in change from baseline 
to 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years.  Exploratory analyses. The CPIC study had 2 primary outcomes: poor MHRQL (12- item 
mental health composite score, MCS-12<=40), and depressive symptom s (PHQ-8 >=10 or PHQ-
2 < 3 for 4 -year follow -up); and a community-prioritized outcome of mental wellness (a response 
of at least “a good bit of the time” in the previous 4 weeks to feeling calm or peaceful, having energy, or being happy), based on community input matched to the 36- item short-form health 
survey quality-of- life items.  We developed 2 indicators: “clinical remission” (PHQ -8 < 10 or 
PHQ-2 < 3) and, with stakeholder input, “co mmunity -deﬁned remission” (PHQ-8 < 10 or PHQ-2 
< 3 or MCS-12 > 40 or any mental wellness). We also used a count of survey periods in remission from baseline up to 3-year follow-up. Intervention status was the cl ient’s program 
assignment at en rollment to CEP or RS.  
For time (survey period) to ﬁrst remission, we used Cox proportional hazard models for 
the full sample with any survey data (n = 1018), limited to those at risk for subsequent clinical (n = 995) and community- deﬁned (n = 408) remission at baseline. We used linear re gression for 
number of periods in remission during the course of 3 years for the full sample (n = 1018). We developed models including intervention status, adding social determinants, then depression 
treatment .

Analyses for 4 -year outcome: 
We conducted intent -to-treat analyses with intervention status as the main  independent 
variable, using lo gistic regression for probability of remission (clinical, community -deﬁned) for 
the sample with 4 -year data (n = 298). We conducted analyses par allel to the [ADDRESS_609589];28(10):1268-78. doi: 10.1007/s11606-013-2484-3. Epub 2013 May 7. Erratum in: J Gen Inte rn Med. 2013

RAND/UCLA IN FORMATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH  Page [ADDRESS_609597] YOU BEEN SELECTED?  
You were selected for the main project  because you reported some symptoms of depression or 
stress in the short screening interview. Many problems and stresses can cause similar symptoms. 
Only a provider who has done a clinical assessment can tell whether you have depression or 
another health issue that might benefit from treatment.  
 WHAT WILL WE ASK  YOU TO DO?  
For this research project  we will ask you  to: 
1.  Complete a 1 hour telephone interview in the next two weeks for which we will give you 
$15 to thank you for your time.  
2. Complete another interview in  6 months and one more in  12 months. You will receive $20 
for the 6 -month interview and $[ADDRESS_609598] ? 
No, the proje ct does not provide treatment. The project  can only give you a list of places where 
you can go to receive treatment. It is up to you to decide if you want treatment. We cannot 
guarantee that any agency on this list can take you for treatment, or take you q uickly.  
 If you get assessed or treated for depression, it may be important for you to discuss what goes into your written record with your provider. This is important because some private insurance companies sometimes deny coverage or set prices based on  an individual’s treatment history.  
 BENEFITS  OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROJECT  
• Some people find the interviews interesting and helpful in their understanding some of their feelings.  
• You might receive information about depression that might help you or someone you know.

Want to Know More?  
We are only asking you to participate in telephone interviews, but you may be 
wondering why we are doing this project  or what is going to happen during 
the project . This sheet will give you more information about CPIC.   
 
WHAT IS THE MAIN PROJECT ABOUT?  
This project  compares two different ways  of supporting community- based agencies in 
providing services for depression. All participating agencies  are being provided with 
some help . Some agencies are supported ind ependently by [CONTACT_475483]. Other agencies are supported to work together as a group to improve 
services . For example , they might share resources or staff.  
 
Agencies are placed in the individual support or group planning by [CONTACT_3364], like a coin 
toss, also called randomization. Regardless of which support  program they are in, all 
agencies are free to use or not to use the resources provided by [CONTACT_46776].  
 
The resources provided by [CONTACT_475484], assessment, and treatments 
that are proven to help people with depression. There are no new or experimental 
treatments being supported in the project.  
 
The agency that you are in now has been assigned t o one of the two ways we 
mentioned above for improving services.  
 
• You are free to tell a provider or staff member at this agency about your 
participation in this project  if you wish.  
• The provider or staff member at this agency is  free to work with you us ing 
resources from the project  or to follow their usual procedures.  
 
If this agency has been assigned to the group planning model for improving services, 
you may receive a follow -up call or be asked to return for a visit at either this agency or 
another agency from the group of agencies working together. That is the main way that you will learn that your agency is in the group -support program.  
 
Regardless, you will be able to visit or use agencies in your community and receive 
services as you normally would. You and your providers will also be able to choose 
whether or not to use any resources from this project  that are offered to you. That is, 
these resources may be new options that you can choose to use or not.  
 
Either way, all agencies have support from the information and resources provided by 
[CONTACT_475485]. We hope to learn  whether it is 
better for agencies to do their best by [CONTACT_475486], and that is why the project  is being conducted by [CONTACT_475487]. We will use the results of the project to share what we learned together about 
how to improve depression services in the community.

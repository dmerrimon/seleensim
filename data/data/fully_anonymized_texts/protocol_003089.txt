3.0BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Everolimus  is a novel  oral derivative  of rapamycin.  
 
Everolimus  has been  in clinical  development  since 1996  as an immuno suppressant  in solid organ 
transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (C ertica n®) for prophylaxis  of rejection in 
renal  and cardiac transplantation in a number  of countries,  including the majority  of the European 
Union.  Everolimus  has been  in development  for patients  with various  malignanci es since  2002.  
 
Everolimus  is being investigated  as an anticancer  agent  based  on its potential  to act: 
 
• Directly  on the tumor  cells by [CONTACT_482902]  
 
• Indirectly  by [CONTACT_61670] a ngiogenesis,  leading  to reduced  tumor  vascularity (via potent  inhibition of 
tumor  cell HIF-1 activity, vascular en dothelial  growth factor  (VEGF)  production,  and VEGF - 
induced proliferation of endothelial  cells).  The role of angiog enesis  in the maintenance of solid 
tumor  growth is well established,  and the mammalian  target  of rapamyc in (mTOR)  pathway  has 
been  implicated  in the regulation of tumor  production of proangiogenic  factors as well as 
modulation of VEGFR  signaling in endothelial  cells.  
 
At weekly  and daily schedules  and at various  doses  explo red, Everolimus  is gener ally well tolerated. 
The most  frequent  adverse events  (rash,  mucos itis, fatigue,  and headache)  associat ed with 
Everolimus  therapy  are manageable.  Noninfect ious pneumonitis  has been reported with mTOR 
inhibitors,  but is commonly  low grade  and reversible.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_620327] and Mechanism  of Action  
 
At the cellular  and molecular  levels,  Everolimus  acts as a sig nal transduction inhibit or. Everolimus 
selectively  inhibits  mTOR,  a key and highly  conservative serine- threonine  kinase,  which is present in 
all cells and is a centr al regulator  of protein synthesis and ultimately  cell growth,  cell proliferation, 
angiogenesis,  and cell survival. mT OR is the only currently  known target  of Everolimus.(1)  
 
mTOR  is downstream  of the PI3K/AKT  pathway, a pathway  known to be dysregulated in a wide 
spectrum  of human  cancers (e.g., through loss/m utation of the PTEN  negative  regulator,  through 
PI3K mutat ion/amplification,  through AKT/PKB overexpression/overactivation,  and through 
modulation of tuberous  sclerosis co mplex  1 and 2 (TSC1/TSC2)  tumor  suppressors).  In addition, 
activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR  pathway  is frequently  a characteristic  of worseni ng prognosis 
through  increased aggressiveness, r esistance to treatment,  and progression.  
 
The main known functions of  mTOR  include the following (1- 2):

 • mTOR  functions  as a se nsor of mitogens,  growth factors, and energy  and nutrient  levels, 
facilita ting cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase  in appropriate growth  condition s. 
• The PI3K/mTOR  pathway  itself is frequently  activated in many  human  cancers, and oncogenic 
transformation may sensitize tumor  cells to mTOR inhibitors.  
• Through the inactivation of the eukar yotic transl ation initiation factor  (elf)4E- binding proteins  (4E- 
BP1)  and activation  of the 40S ribosomal  S6 kinases (i.e., p 70S6K1),  mTOR  regulates  the 
translation of important  messages, including those encoding the HIF-1 proteins,  c-myc, ornithine 
decarboxylase,  and cyclin D1, as well as riboso mal proteins  themselves.  
• The activation  of the mT OR  pathway  leads  to the increas ed production  of proangi ogenic  factors 
(i.e., VEGF)  in tumors  and to tumor,  endothelial,  and smooth muscle cell growth  and 
proliferation.  
• The regulation of mTOR  signaling  is complex  and involves  positive  regulators,  such as AKT that 
phosphorylate and inactivate  negative regulators  such as the TSC1/TSC 2. 
 
 
 
mTOR  is represented by [ADDRESS_620328] multiprot ein signaling  complexes, 
mTOR  complex  1 (mTORC1,  rapamycin sensiti ve) and mT OR  complex  2 (mTORC2,  rapamycin 
insensi tive).(3)  
 
mTORC1  is mainly  activated  via the PI3 kinase pathway  through AKT (also  known  as PKB,  protein 
kinase B) and the TSC1/TSC2.(2)  Activated AKT phosphorylates  TSC2,  which  lead to the 
dissociation  of the TSC1/TSC2  complex,  thus inhibiting the ability of TSC2  to act as a GTPase - 
activating pr otein.  This allows Rheb,  a small  G-protein,  to remain in a GTP-bound state and to 
activate mTORC1.  AKT can also activate  mTORC1  by [CONTACT_482903] -rich AKT substrate 
of 40 kilodaltons (PRAS40),  thereby  [CONTACT_214791]40 -mediated inhibition  of mTORC1.(4 -5) 
 
mTORC2  is activated through a currently unknown me chanism,  possibly  by [CONTACT_482904] 
(RTK)  signaling.(4)  It has been  sugg ested that mTORC2  phos phorylates  and activates  a different 
pool of AKT that is not upstream  of mTORC1.  PH domain leucine -rich repeat protein phosphatase 
(PHLPP)  plays a role of a negative regulator.  mTORC2  is rapamycin insensitive and is required f or 
the organiz ation of the actin  cytoske leton.(3)  
 
mTORC1 -mediated  signaling is subject  to modulation by [CONTACT_482905],  such as Everolimus.  Once  these ag ents bind to the 12 kDa cytosolic FK 506-binding 
protein  12 (FKBP12),  an immunop hilin, the resulting rapamycin- FKBP12  complexes  bind to a 
specific  site near the catalytic  domain  of mT O RC1 and inhibit  phospho rylation of mTOR  substrates. 
As a conseq uence,  downstream  signaling  events  involved  in regulation of the G1 to S-phase 
transition are inhibited.  This mechanism  is thought to be responsible for the immun osuppressive 
effects  of rapamycin as well as its putative  antineoplastic  activity.(6) As many  cancers  are 
characteriz ed by [CONTACT_482906] G1 transit  (e.g., overexpr ession of cyclin  or cyclin- dependent 
kinases),  inhibition  of mTOR becomes  an intriguing target  for inducing cytostasis.(2) 
 
 
3.2 Preclinical Studies

IRB#:  10-165A(1)  
Page  [ADDRESS_620329] demonstrated th at Everolim us is a potent  inhibitor  of the proliferation 
of a range  of human tumor  cell lines in vitro, with IC50s rangi ng from sub/low  nanomol ar (nM) to µM 
concentrati ons, concent rations  capa ble of being  reached in patients  at the doses  used in clinical 
trials.  
 
Everolimus  was shown  to have activity  in human  tumor  cell lines originating from lung,  breast, 
prostate,  colon,  kidney,  melanoma,  and glioblas toma.  Everolimus  was also shown to have  activity  in 
human  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  cells,  where  induction  of apoptosis  was reported, (7) as well as in 
acute  myeloid  leukemia  cells,(8)  adult T-cell leukemia  cells, (9) diffuse  large B-cell lymphoma cel ls 
(DLBCL),( 10) pancreatic  tumor  cells,(11)  ovarian cancer  cells,(12 -13) and hepatoc ellular carcinoma 
cells.(14)  
 
As a single  agent,  Everolimus  inhibited proliferation in 3 mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (Jeko1, 
SP49,  and NCEB1)  approximately  40% to 65% compared  to control  cells. This was associat ed with 
G1 cell-cycle arrest  and reduced ph osphorylation of the mT OR  downstream  target,  4E-BP1.(15)  
 
In a clonoge nic assay  using  cells from 81 patient -derived tumor  xenografts  never  cultured in vitro (11 
human  tumor types,  with 3 to 24 tumors  each:  bladder,  colon, gastric,  non- small  cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC)  [adeno,  squamous  epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130],  and large cell], small  cell lung cancer  (SCLC),  breast, 
ovarian,  pancreatic,  renal, melanom a, and pleur amesothelioma),  Everolimus  inhibit ed colony 
formation  in a concentrat ion-depende nt manner.  In addition,  normal  hemat opoietic  stem cells were 
insensi tive to Everolim us, with an IC50 about  15-fold higher  than the tumor  lines.  
 
Everolimus  also inhibits the proliferat ion of human  umbilical vein endothel ial cells (HUVECS),  with 
particular  potency  against  VEGF -induced prolife ration.  The inhibition  of endothelial  proliferation a nd 
antiangioge nic activity  of Everolimus  was confirmed in vivo, as Everolimus  selectively  inhibited 
VEGF -dependent  angiogenic  response. Mice with primary  and metastatic  tumors  treated  with 
Everolimus  showed a significant  reduction  in blood vessel d ensity  when  compared to controls  at well 
tolerated doses. Additi onally,  activity  in a VEG F-impregnated  s.c. implant model  of angiogenesis  and 
reduced vascularity (vessel density)  of Everoli mus - treated  tumors  (muri ne melanom a) provided 
evidence of in vivo effects  of angiog enesis. 
 
Everolimus  also inhibits tumor  grow th in vivo in xenografted,  syngeneic,  and orthotopic  animal 
models,  residing longer  in tumor  tissue than in plasma  and demonstrating high tumor  penetration in a 
rat pancr eatic tumor  model.  These effects  occurred within  the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg  p.o. 
daily.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the antitumor  activity of Everol imus monot herapy  was that of reducing tumor  growth 
rates  rather  than producing regressio ns or stable disease.  
 
Everolimus,  administered p.o., was a potent  inhibitor  of tumor  growth and well tolerat ed in: 
 
• an s.c. mouse xenograft  model,  established from a variety  of tumor  cell lines of diverse 
histotypes  (NSCLC,  pancreatic,  colon,  melanoma,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_015]),  including a P-gp170 
overexpres sing multidrug -resistant  tumor  line 
• a series  of low-passage tumor  xenografts  established directly  from human tumor  material, 
maintained only in vivo and conside red highly  predictive  of therapeutic  outcome in patients. 
These included breast  (5 lines),  colorectal  (9 lines), gastric  (3 lines),  lung (22 lines,  including

 adenocarci nomas,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_309928], large cell and small  cell histotypes),  melanoma (6 lines), 
ovarian  (4 lines),  pancr eatic (3 lines), and renal  (6 lines).  
• in 2 syngeneic  models  (CA20948  rat pancreatic,  B16/Bl6 mo use orthotop ic melanoma) 
Taken  together, these d ata indicate the broad  antiproliferative potential  of Everolim us. 
It is not clear which  molecular  deter minants  predict  respo nsiveness of tumor  cells to Everolim us. 
Molecular  analysis  has revealed that relative  sensitivity  to Everolimus  in vitro correlates  with the 
degree  of phosphorylation (activation)  of the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribosomal  protein. 
PTEN  status  alone  may not be predictive  of Everolimus  relative  in vitro sensitivity;  however,  in some 
cases (i.e., GBM)  there is also a cor relation with PTEN  status.  
 
In preclinical  models,  the administration of Everolimus  is asso ciated with reduction of protein 
phosphorylation in target  proteins  downstream  of mTOR,  notably  phosphorylated  S6 (pS6)  and p4E- 
BP1,  and occasionally  with an increase in phos phorylation AKT (pAKT).  
 
 
3.2.1  Preclinical  Safe ty  
 
In safety  pharmacologic  studies,  Everolimus  was devoid  of relevant  effects  on vital functions, 
including  the cardiovascular, respi [INVESTIGATOR_696],  and nervous  systems. Everol imus had no influence on QT 
interval  prolongation.  Furthermore,  Everolimus  showed no antigenic  potential.  Although Everolimus 
passes  the blood- brain  barrier,  there was no indication  of relevant  changes  in the behavior  of 
rodents,  even after single oral doses  up to 2000 mg/kg or after repeated administration of up to 40 
mg/kg/day.  Based  on these findin gs, the potential  of Everolimus  to affect  vital functi ons in patients is 
considered to be low. 
 
Everolimus  is consi dered to have  no genotoxicity  or carcinog enicity  potential.  All significant  adverse 
events  observed  in preclinical toxicology studies  with Everolimus  in mice,  rats, monkeys,  and 
minipi[INVESTIGATOR_482871],  and were,  at least in part, reversible  after a 2- or 4-week  recovery  period,  with 
the exception of the changes  in male  reproductive organs,  most notably  testes. Ocular  effects 
(lenticular  disorders)  observed  in rats were not observed  in any other  species  and are considered t o 
be a species-specif ic disorder.  
 
 
3.3 Clinical  Experience  
 
3.3.1  Everolimus  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Everolimus  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_63946] a median  tmax of 1 to 2 hours.  The bioavailability  of the drug is 
believed to be 11% or greater.  The area under  the curve (AUC) 0-τ is dose -proportional  over the dose 
range between 5 mg and 70 mg in the weekly  regimen and 5 mg and 10 mg in the daily regi men. C max  
is dose- proportional  between 5 mg and 10 mg for both the weekly  and daily regimens.  At doses of  20 
mg/w eek and higher, the increase in Cm ax is less than dose -proportional.  The coefficient  of

 Trough  levels  (24 hours  postdose)  correlate well with AUC 0-τ at steady  state during  daily 
administration.  
 
In whole blood, at a daily dose  of 10 mg, about  20% of Everolimus  is confined in plasma, with 26% 
being  unbo und. The remaining 80% is sequester ed in blood  cells.  
 
Everolimus  is extensively  metabolized in the liver and eliminated in the bile. Major  metabolites  are 
inactive.  Elimination  half-life is approximately  30 hours.  The clearance of Everolim us is 
approximat ely halved in patients  with mild-moderate hepatic  impairment  (Child -Pugh Class  A or B), 
while  renal  impairment  has little or no impact  on the pharmacokinetics  of Everolimus.  
 
Age, weight,  and sex in the adult  population  do not affect  the pharmacokinetics  of Everolimus  to a 
clinically  relevant  extent. The clearance of Everolimus  is reduced in children.  Pharmacokinetic 
characteris tics are not notably  different  between Caucasian and Japane se subjects, whereas  in 
Black  patie nts, populati on pharmacokinetic  studies  have  shown  an average 20% higher clearanc e. 
 
A high- fat meal altered  the absorpti on of Everolimus,  with a 1.3-hour delay  in tmax, a 60% reduction in 
Cmax, and a 16% reduction  in AUC.  
 
Everolimus  is a substrate of cytochrome P450  3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4)  and a substrate  and 
moderate inhibitor  of the multidrug efflux  pump P- glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1,  or ABCB1).  Hence,  its 
metabolism  is sensitive to drugs  that modify  these enzymes  (substrates, inducers,  or inhibitors  of 
these  enzymes). Competitive  inhibi tion could  occur when Everolimus  is combined with drugs  that 
are also CYP3A4  or P-gp substrates.

Phar macokinetic/phar macodynamic  modeling based  on inhibition of the biomarker  p70S6 kinase 1 
[S6K1]  in peripheral  blood mononuclear  cells (PBMC)  sugg ests that 5 mg to 10 mg daily should b e 
an adequate dose to produce a high degree of sustained target inhibiti on ([Study  C2101] / [Study  
2102]).(16)  Furthermor e, molecular  pharmacodynamic  (MPD)  studies,  using immun ohistochemis try 
(IHC)  in biopsied tumor  tissue,  assessed the degree of inhibition and its duration  for pS6, p4E-BP1, 
and pAKT  expression with the daily and weekly  dosing.  There was high inhibition  of the downstream 
markers  S6K1  and 4E-BP1 at 5mg/day, which  was complete at 10 mg/day,  and preliminary  results 
suggest  an increase in pAKT expression,  with maximal  effect at 10 mg daily ([Study  C2107]).(17)  
 
 
3.3.3  Clinical Experience  with Everolimus  
 
Since  1996,  Everolimus  has been in vestigated as a component  of multidrug  immun osuppression in 
solid organ  transplantation.  On July 8, 2003,  the European Union  approved the use of Everolimu s, 
under  the trade  name  [CONTACT_482930] n®, as prophylaxis  of organ  rejection in adult patients  receiving an 
allogeneic  renal or cardiac  transpla nt. The most  frequent  adverse drug reactions  in this setting  are 
highly  specif ic to the transplant  contex t. However, certain  events  are gene ralizable,  most notably  
myelosuppression,  skin disorders,  and increas es in blood lipid levels.

 In March  2009,  the [LOCATION_002]  Food and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approved  Everolimus  for the 
treatment  of advanced renal  cell carcinoma (RCC)  in patients  with advanced RCC after treatment 
with sunitinib or sorafenib has failed.  
 
Everolimus  has been  in developme nt for patients  with cancer since 2002.  As of August  31, 2008, 
approximat ely [ADDRESS_620330] been  treated in [COMPANY_001] -sponsored or 
non-Novart is-sponsored studies, and in 3 healt hy volunteer  clinical  stud ies. Overall,  [COMPANY_001] 
sponsored a total of 28 studies  of Everolimus  administered either  as single agent  (n=13) or in 
combination with other  antitumor  agents  (n=15).  Ongoing or completed investigator -sponsored 
studies  also enrolled over [ADDRESS_620331] been  or are being conducted  in various  advanced 
malignanci es. Five Phase  I studies  evaluated several  escala ting doses  with either  weekly or daily 
administration (Studies  C2101/02,  C2106,  C2107,  C1101)  of Everolim us, with the objective  to identify 
an optimal  regimen and dosage based on safety, pharmacokinetics,  and knowledge of the drug’s 
molecular  effec ts on various  tumors.  The 10 mg/day  and 50 mg to 70 mg/week  dosages  were 
proposed for further  studies when using  Everolimus  as a single  agent  and as a target maximum 
dose  in combi nation stu dies. In addition,  2 Phase I studies, one conduc ted in prosta te cancer (Study 
C2106)  and the other  in Japanese p atients  with advanced cancers  (Study C1101),  evaluated the 
safety  and the molecular  changes  in tumor  associated with the administration of Everolimus.  
 
Two Phase II monotherapy  studies  were  design ed to evaluate the safety  and efficacy of a single 
dose of 10 mg administered daily,  including Study C2235 in advanced  NSCLC  (n=81)  and Study 
C2239  in advanced pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors  (n=160).  
 
A Phase  III, randomized,  double- blind,  placebo- controlled study  in patients  with metastatic  RCC who 
progressed on a VEGFR TK inhibitor  (TKI)  demonstrated that everolimus,  adminis tered daily at an 
oral dose of 10 mg, provides positive clinical  benefit.(18)  Median progression- free survival (PFS)  
was prolonged from 1.87 months  for patients  recei ving placebo to 4.01 months  for everolimus - 
treated  patients, assessed by [CONTACT_482907] (hazard ratio,  0.30;  
95% CI, 0.22– 0.40;  p<0·0001).  
 
Updated results  presen ted at the American Society  of Clinical  Oncology  2009 Genitourinary  Cancers 
Symposium  (19) demonstrated everolimus  as having even greater  superiority  to placebo in the 
primary  endpoint  of PFS.  Median  PFS was prolonged from 1.9 months  for patients  receiving  placebo 
to 4.9 months  for everolimus -treated patients,  assessed by [CONTACT_482908] (hazard  ratio,  0.33;  95% CI, 0.25– 0.43;  p<0.001).  
 
Overall,  the most  frequent  adverse effects  suspected  to be re lated to Everolimus  have  been 
stomatitis, r ash, anemia,  fatigue,  asthenia,  diarrhea, anorexia,  nausea,  hypercholeste rolemia, 
mucosal  inflammation,  vomiting,  hypertriglycerid emia,  cough,  peripheral  edema,  dry skin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], 
pruritus,  and dyspnea.  The most common  grade 3 or 4 adverse reacti ons suspected to be related to 
treatment  were  anemia,  infectio ns, hyperglycem ia, stomatitis, fatigue,  lymphopenia, 
hypercholesterolemia,  pneumonitis,  and elevated gamma -glutamyltransferase conc entrations.  
Noninfectio us low-grade (grade  1/2) pneumonitis  has led to the development  of treatment  guidelines

The trial is looking at an active agent,  namely  gemcitabine  in combinati on with a novel  agent  with 
pre-clinical data suggesting that urothelial cancer represents  a rationale  target  for m-TOR inhibition. 
A trial at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering Cancer  Center  (MSKCC)  (protocol  08-123) of Everolimus  in 
patients  with metastatic  transitional  cell carcinoma  of the urothelium  that has progressed after first- 
line therapy  with a 2-mo nth progression free survival  endpoi nt is ongoing.  
 
  
At MSKCC,  we perform ed an immu nohistochemical  (IHC)  study  to assess whether  mTOR pathw ay 
markers  are expressed in high-stage bladder  urothelial  carcin omas.  The study  was carried  out on a 
tissue microarray  of 92 cases of invasive urothelial  carcino ma of the bladder (≥ pT2) using 
antibodies  against  phospho- S6 and phospho- 4E BP1,  both markers  for an activated mTOR 
pathway.  Staining was graded  as 0 to 3+ (0=0-5%; 1+=6 -25%;  2+=26 -50%;  and 3+=>50%  tumor 
cells positive)  for phsop ho-S6 (cytoplasmic) and phospho-4E BP1 (cyto plasmic  and/or nuclear). 
Presence of at least two evaluable cores  from each tumor  was required f or inclusion  in the final 
evaluation.  The results  of immunor eactivity  in tumor  cells demonstrated that mT OR  pathway 
markers  are overexpressed in invasive  urothelial  carcinoma  of the bladder with correlation of 
expression seen  within  molecules  of the mTOR  pathway  using  Spearm ans correlati on coefficient 
(rho=0.411)  (see table below).(34)  This suggests that m-TOR targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482872].

3.4 Gemcitabine  
 
Gemcitabine (2',2'-difluoro-2' deoxycytidine;  Gemzar,  Eli Lilly and Co, Indianapolis,  IN) is a novel 
deoxy cytidine  analog  with a broad  spectrum  of antitumor  activity.  Gemcit abine has a molecular 
weight  of 299.66,  and after intracell ular activatio n, the active  metabolite is incorporat ed into DNA, 
resulting in inhibition of further  DNA synthesis. Gemcitabine may also inhibit  ribonucleotide 
reductase a nd cytidine deaminase as part of its cyto toxic activity.(20) Si nce its approval in 1996 by 
[CONTACT_482909], (20-21) gemcitabine has been found  to have effective 
antitumor  activity  against  a broad  spectrum  of tumor  types, including  breast,  ovarian,  non-small  cell 
lung,  and bladder.  Studies  in patients with metastatic  transitional  cell carcinoma (TCC)  of the 
bladder  have  reported overall  response rates  to single-agent  gemcitabi ne that ranged from 22.5%  in 
previously  treated  patie nts to 28% in those who were  not previously  treated.(22- 24) These studies 
also report ed that single-agent  gemcitabine therapy was well tolerated and that the incidence of 
systemic side effects  was low. A multicenter,  randomized,  Phase III study  in patients  with

vinblastine,  doxorubicin,  and cisplatin (MVAC),  although overall  survival was similar  in both treatment  
groups.(25)  On the basis  of its excell ent clinical activity, patient  tolerability,  and chemical 
characteris tics, gemcit abine repres ents a logical  candidate for intravesic al therapy.  
 
3.4.1  Preclinical  Studie s  with Intravesical  Gemcitabine  
 
We studied  the toxicolo gy and pharmacokinetics  of gemcitabine delivered  intravesically  in dogs  to 
provide  the basis  for subsequent  clinical  studies. 
 
Methods:  Toxicolo gy (n=6): The animals  (in groups  of 2) received 100 mg, 350 mg, or 1 g of 
gemcitabine intravesically  on alternate days 3 times/week  for 4 weeks.  The animals  were  observed 
for signs  of toxicity;  gemcitabine levels and peripheral  blood  counts  were taken 3 times  weekly. 
Tetrahydrouridine (THU)  was added  to prevent  ex vivo degradation  of gemcitabine  by [CONTACT_482910].  One dog from each group  was euthanized at day [ADDRESS_620333] dose and the other  dog 
from each group  at day 14. Full necropsy was performed  in all animals.  Urine  specime ns with and 
without  THU were  examined to exclude any degradation of the drug.  Pharmacokinetics  (n=5): 
Intravesical  gemcitabine was given  at 100 mg (n=2),  350 mg (equivalent  to 1000mg/m2 human  
dose)  (n=2),  and 3.5 g (n=1).  Intravenous  gemcitabine was given at 350 mg (n=2).  Serum  samp les 
were  drawn at 30 minutes  and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 ho urs. 
 
Results:  Toxicology: 100 mg and 350 mg were well tolerated,  with no demonstrable side effec ts. At 
350 mg, the white  cell co unt nadir  was 2.9 and 3.1 (x103µl)  and the platelet  count  dropped to 97 and 
63 (x103/µl).  Necropsy revealed normal  bone marrow  cellularity,  normal  bladder  histology,  and no 
other  abnormalities.  At 1000  mg, signs  of severe  toxicity  were  seen;  these dogs received  only 3 
doses.  One dog died at day 3 following  cessation of treatment  and 1 was euthaniz ed at day 5 due to 
febrile neutropenia.  The necropsy  was consistent with hemorrhagic  cystitis and gastr ointestinal 
toxicity.  Pharmacokinet ics: At 100 mg and 350 mg, significant  systemic absorption of gemcitabine 
was seen,  with peak  serum levels  observed  at 1 hour and with detectable levels  up to 8 hours 
following  intravesical  gemcitabine.  For a given dose, the AUC for intravesical administration is 
approximat ely half that of the intravenous  infusi on. As the AUC is a better  predictor  of toxicity,  it is 
concluded t hat the equivalent  systemic dose,  if given  intravesically,  would be half as toxic.  
 
 
3.4.2  Clinical Experience  with Intravesical  Ge mcitabine  
 
We conduc ted a Phase I study  of gemcitabine a dministered intravesically  in 18 patients  with TCC of 
the bladder  refractory  to Bacille  Calm ette-Guér in (BCG),  and the results  showed excellent  tolerability 
to intravesical  gemcitabine given  twice  a week. (26) The patients  included 14 men and 4 women (4:1 
male/female ratio),  with a median  age of 74 years  (range,  37–86 years).  Stages  of bladder  cancer 
included refractory  0is in 12 patients  and recurr ent T1 carcin oma with or without  0is in 6 patients. 
Patients  were previously  treated  with 1 to 4 courses of BCG,  and 5 patien ts had been  previously  
treated  wi th  intravesical  chemotherapy,  including  mitomycin, valrubicin,  thiotepa,  and Adriamycin.

 Four intravesical do se levels of gemcitabine were evaluated:  500 mg, 1000 mg, 1500  mg, and 2000 
mg. Of the 18 eligible  patients, 3 were enrolled  at dose level I (500 mg), 6 at dose  level II (1000  mg), 
3 at dose level III (1500  mg), and 6 at dose level IV (2000  mg). Intravesical  gemcit abine was 
administered twice  weekly  in [ADDRESS_620334] between courses, f or a 
total of 12 in stillations. At the end of 8 weeks, pa tients  were  evaluated for response.  Patients  who 
demonstrated CR (negative posttreatment  cytology  and cystoscopy)  underwent  close surveillance 
with serial  cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_193238] 3-month intervals.  If recurrence was detected,  2 additional  courses  (3 
weeks  each,  separated by 1 week)  of intravesical  gemcitabine could  be considered,  followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]- 
evaluation.  For patients  who did not achieve initial  CR or who suffered a relapse,  a radical 
cystectomy was recommended.  
 
Toxicity:  Gemcitabine as an intravesical agent was well tolerated.  The most commonly  observed 
toxicities  were as follows:  At dose level I (500 mg; n=3),  1 patient  had grade  1 nausea, and there was  
no urothelial  toxici ty. At dose  level II (1000  mg; n=6),  4 patients  experienced grade 2 urinary 
frequency  (more  than 2 times  normal  frequency  or urinatio n) and 1 experienced grade 3 urinary  
frequency  (more  than hourly  urination with urgency);  intermittent  gross  hematuria without  clots was 
present  in 3 patients,  2 patients  experienced grade 1 nausea  and fatigue,  and 1 patie nt had a skin 
reaction that resembled a grade  3 hand- foot syndrome.  At dose level III (1500 mg; n=3),  minimal 
urinary  symptoms  were  experienced by [CONTACT_21129] 3 patients, but no systemic symptoms  were  observed.  At 
dose  level IV (2000  mg; n=6),  urinary  symptoms  were  minimal;  grade 3 t hrombocyt openia  and 
neutropenia was seen in 1 patient,  without  infectious  complications,  but no grade  4 systemic 
toxicities  were observed.  DLT was not reached;  [ADDRESS_620335]  soluble  dose in 100 mL of 
sodium  chloride. 
 
Phar macokinetics:  Levels  of gemcit abine in the serum  were  evaluated at all [ADDRESS_620336],  seventh,  and ninth instillations. Serum  levels  of gemcitabine  were detected at dose level 
IV (2000  mg) in [ADDRESS_620337] 3 dose levels  (500, 1000,  and 1500  mg). 
 
Based  on the results  of our Phase  I study,  we subsequently  conducted  a Phase II trial in patien ts 
with superficial  TCC of the bladder  who were refractory  or intolerant  to BCG  therapy  and who had 
refused  cystectomy.(27)  The patients  included  22 men and 8 women  (7:3 male/female ratio),  with a 
median  age of 70 years  (range,  43–89 years).  Stages  of bladder cancer  immediately  before 
intravesical  instilla tion included 0is in [ADDRESS_620338] between courses, for a total of 12 instillations.  At the end of 8 
weeks, patients were  evaluated for response.  Patients  who demonstrated CR (cytolo gy and 
cystoscopy) underwent  close  surveillance with urine cytology  and serial  cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_193238] 3- to 4- 
month intervals. For patients  who did not achieve initial CR, a radical  cystectomy was recommen ded. 
The median follow -up for all patients was 19 months  (range,  0 to 35 months).  Of the  
30 pa tients  treated with intravesical  gemcitabine,  15 (50%;  95% CI, 32%–68%)  had CR; however, 
only 21% (95%  CI, 0%–43%)  of these patients  were  free of recurrence  at 1 year.  Therefore,  of the 
total 30 patients  treated with intravesical  gemcit abine,  only 10% (95%  CI, 0%–21%)  were  free of 
recurrence  at 1 year.  Of the  15 patients who achieved CR, 14 were  available  for recur rence and

 progression analysis:  12 had tumor  recurrence,  with a median  recurre nce-free survival time of 3.6 
months  (95%  CI, 2.9–11.0 months),  and 2 had no tumor  recurrence at 23 and 29 months, 
respectively. Overall,  2 patients  had progression to a higher  stage  while  receiving ge mcitabine 
therapy.  The median follow -up for patients  without progression or cystectomy was 19 months 
(range,  2 to 35 months).  Of the 30 patients,  11 (37%) underwent  a cystectomy after treatment  with 
gemcitabine;  4 of these 11 patients  had CR to the gemcitabine therapy.  
 
Toxicity:  Gemcitabine as an intravesical agent was well tolerated in this Phase II study, with a 
reported  toxicity  similar  to that of our Phase I study: grade  2 dysuria (occasional  pain or difficulty 
urinating)  in 3 patients,  grade 3 dysuria (continuo us difficulty  urinating ch aracterized by [CONTACT_482911])  in 6 patients,  a rash on the glans  penis  in 1 patie nt, and cellulitis of the leg (requiring 
intravenous  antibiotics)  in [ADDRESS_620339] been evaluated in 2 
other  Phase I studies, albeit  using a less intensive weekly  schedule.  Laufer et al studied  the weekly 
administration of gemcitabine in 15 patients  who had recur rent TCC after intravesical  therapy.(28) 
Levels  of gemcitabine in the serum  were  low in patients  receiving 40 mg/mL,  and they were 
undetectable at concent rations  of 5 mg/mL,  10 mg/mL,  15 mg/mL,  and 20 mg/mL.  Levels  of the 
metabolite dFdU  (difluorodeoxyuridi ne), howev er, were  detectable in plasma  of patients  receivin g 
gemcitabine at concent rations  of 15 mg/mL  or higher,  which  implies  that the amount  of gemcitabine 
absorbed at lower  doses  is minimal.  Laufer  and colleagues  found that intravesical  gemcitabine  was 
well tolerat ed and had minimal  toxici ty, and 9 of the 13 patien ts available f or assessm ent were  free of  
recurrence  at 12 weeks. In their Phase  I study, De Berardinis  et al found that at concentrations  of 
40 mg/mL  gemcitabine was systemically  undet ectable,  but they were able to detect  the inactive 
metabolite dFdU  in plasma.(29)  
 
In our experience,  substantial  CR can be achieved initially  in patients  receiving intravesical 
gemcitabine,  but the 1-year durable CR was only 10% as the majority  of patients  underwent  a 
relapse  within  12 months,  which  supports the concept of combining intravesical  gemcitabine with 
other  agents  to improve  the durability  of CR. 
 
 
 
3.5 Carcinoma In  Situ (0is)  
 
3.5.1  Natural  History  of Bladder  Cancer  
 
More  than 70,000  new cases  of bladder cancer  are diagnos ed each  year in the [LOCATION_002].(30) 
Seventy  to 80% of bladder tumors  are non-muscle invasive tumors  (stage  Ta, Tis, T1), 25% are 
muscle invasive  (stage  T2, T3), and 5% are metastatic. Sixty to 70% of non-muscle invasive  tumors 
recur,  while  20% to 30% progress  to a higher  stage or grade.(31)  
 
Superficial  or non-muscle invasive urothelial  bladder cancer  (UBC)  includes  stages  Ta, T1, and Tis 
(carcinoma in situ – 0is), with frequencies  of 60%, 30%,  and 10%,  respectively.  The term “non- 
muscle invasive  bladder  cancer”  embraces  a spectrum  of tumors  with varying  degrees  of clinical 
behavior.  The low-grade Ta lesions  common ly recur but rarely  progress  to muscle invasion.  On the 
other  hand,  T1 tumors  represent  a heterogeneous  populati on, including some  of which  behave  in an 
indolent  fashion  and typi[INVESTIGATOR_482873],  as well as others  that behave more

3.5.2  Recurrence 
 
Recurrence rate after transurethral  resection (T UR) ranges  from 30% to 90%,  depending on size, 
site, multifocality,  the presence  of 0is, grade,  and prior history  of bladder  cancer.  The high 
recurrence  rate and the unpredictability  of the progression p attern of bladder cancer  have  led to the 
widespread use of intravesical  therapy as a supp lement  to TUR.  Non-muscle invasive UBC lends 
itself to intrav esical  therapy owing to direct  contact [CONTACT_482912].  Furthermore,  some  agents  can be used  at high doses, with minimal  systemic 
side effec ts due to minimal  absorption.  
 
In a prospective longitudinal  study,  the National  Bladder  Cancer  Collaborative  Group  A (NBCCGA) 
identified a group  of patients  with superficial TCC treated  solely  by [CONTACT_482913].  In this study, size itself did not seem  to be a factor  unless  it was 
greater  than 5 cm. An increased  recurrence rate occurred  in patients  with multiple  tumors,  Grade  3 
disease,  concomitant  0is, lamina propr ia invasion,  and positive  cytology.(32)  
 
 
3.5.3  Progression  
 
Progression is defined as the development  of muscle invasion or metastasis and occu rs in 20% to 
30% of patients who present  with superficial d isease. The NBCCGA  identified tumor  grade,  lamina 
propria  invasion,  and associated 0 is as indicators of progression.  Two percent  of patients with grade 
1 tumors  progressed co mpared to 11% with Grade  2 and 45% with Grade  3, with the majority 
progressing within  24 months  of diagnosis.(32)  Four percent of patients  with Ta lesions progressed 
versus 30% with T1 tumors.  Eight  percent  of tumors without  mucosal  abnormalities  progressed 
versus 33% with moder ate to severe  dysplasia.  In a compi[INVESTIGATOR_482874],  Herr et al reported a 29% 
progression for T1 tumors  and 40% for T1 G3. (33) It is clear  that the poor prognosis  of superfici al 
TCC is predominantly  due to patients with T1 disease.  The high recurre nce rate and t he 
unpredictability  of the progression p attern have led to the investigation of new approaches.

chemotherapeutic  agent  and the tumor.  Furthermore,  very high doses  of some  agents  could  be used 
with minimal  systemic side effects  due to the lack of absorption (e.g.,  mitomycin  is given  at a dose of 
40 mg weekly  for 8 weeks). This led to the widespread use of intravesical  therapy  after resecting the 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_482875]  0is. BCG,  thiotepa, mitomycin  
C, and doxorubicin have b een used  as intravesical agents.  The highest  tumor -free success  rate has 
been  reported  after intravesic al BCG  therapy. Multicenter  studies  have shown that thiotepa and 
doxorubicin are inferior  to BCG  in preventing  tumor  recurrences. In studies comparing mitomycin and 
BCG,  initial tumor -free response r ates are comparable for the 2 agents, with some studies  suggesting  
an advantage for BCG therapy. In a randomized trial comparing BCG to no Amended:  1/11/11

 intravesical  therapy,  38% of patien ts treated  with BCG progressed at 10 years  versus 63% for the 
control  group. There was no significant  difference  between groups  with regard  to stage. Progression 
was defined as muscle invasion or metastatic  disease.  The median  survival times  for both groups 
have  not been  reached.  Ten-year survival in BCG was 75% compared  with 55% in the control  group. 
Patients  with an initial in complete response  to BCG have a poor outcome.  The overall  risk of 
progression is 95% at 5 years  for 0is patients  with an incomplete response but only 19% in those 
with an initial CR. Alternative  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482876] B CG. Mitomycin  C, with a 
15% respo nse when  given intravesically,  is the most  active chemotherapeutic  agent. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_482877], mitomycin  C has neither delayed progression nor preserving the bladd er. Thus, 
more  active agents  need  to be identi fied. 
 
BCG  is associated with toxicity  in the form of local complicatio ns, such as cystitis  in 90% of patien ts, 
requiring interruption  of treatment  in 3.6%,  hematuria in 9%, epi[INVESTIGATOR_482878] 0.4%,  contracted  bladder 
in 0.2%,  granulomatous  prostatitis  in 0.9%,  renal  abscess in 0.1 %, and ureteral  obstruction in 0.3%. 
Systemic complications  represent  the main  concern in BCG -treated  patients. Fever  up to 38.5°C  is 
frequently  observed,  pneumonia and hepatitis  have been reported in 0.9% of patients, and sepsis in 
0.4%.  
 
Everolimus  selectively inhibits  mTOR  (mammal ian target  of rapamycin),  a serine -threonine  kinase, 
which  is present  in all cells and a central regulat or of protein synthesis a nd ultimately  cell growth, 
proliferation,  angiogenesis  and survival.(1) mTOR  is downstr eam of PI3K (phosphatidyl -inosit ol-3- 
kinase)/AKT, a pathway  known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers  through 
various  potential  mech anisms  including loss/mut ation of the PTEN  (phosphatase and tensin  homolog 
deleted  on Chromosome 1 0) negative regulator,  PI3K mutation/amplificati on, AKT/PKB 
overexpres sion/overactivation,  and/or  modulation of TSC1/TSC2  tumor  suppressors. In addition, 
activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR  pathway  is frequently  associated with increased aggressiveness, 
resistance to treatment  and progression.  Previous  work has demonstrated the over-expression of 
activated mTOR  pathway  markers  including ph ospho- S6 and phospho -4E BP1 in invasive  urothelial 
carcinoma specimens.(34)  Preclinical studies  have  demonstrated that that mutational  activation  of 
the PI3K  pathway  through loss of PTEN or activation of the serine/threonine kinase,  AKT, makes 
tumor  cells more sensitive to the anti-tumor  effects  of mTOR  inhibitors.( 35-38) These findings  have 
provided the rationale to explore  the anti-tumor  activity of mTOR in hibitors  in patients with PTEN - 
deficient  tumors  with a proof -of-concept  phase  1 neoadjuvant  trial of rapamycin in patients  with 
recurrent  glioblastoma whose tumors  lacked  PTEN  expression demonstrating anticancer activity.

3.6 Rationale  for this  Study  
 
Rationale  for this study  includes  the following:  
 
1) Standard  manageme nt for patients  with high-risk superfici al disease who fail BCG therapy  is 
removal  of the bladder  (cystectomy). There  is a paucity  of active agents  for patients  who fail 
intravesical  BCG,  none  of which  eliminates  the need for cystectomy.

ME MOR IAL  SLOAN -KETTER ING  CANC ER CEN TER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:  10-165A(1)  
Page  18 of 62  
 2) Patients  wish to avoid  a cystecto my because cystectomy  generally  requires  an external  collecting 
device for urine,  which  is associa ted with poor self-image  and quality  of life. Surgery  results  in 
impotence in men due to the need to remove  the prostate as part of the surgical procedure.  
 
3) The favorable activity  of gemcitabine,  includin g CR, when given  systemically in metastatic 
urothelial  carcinoma  and transient  CR when  used intravesically  for non-muscle-invasive UBC.  
 
4) The acce ptable clinical toxicity  profile  of gemcitabine when given  intravesically.  
 
5) The need  to increase the durabili ty of the response to intravesical ch emotherapy.  
 
6) This proposed  study  targets  patients with stage 0is UBC who have  failed or have relapsed after 
intravesical  BCG,  the standard treatment  for this stage  of disease.  Unfortunately,  standard therapy  is 
frequently  ineffective in the setting  of persistent  or recurrent  disease. Persistent or recurrent  0is after 
BCG  is an ominous  sign. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_482879],  some  patients  refuse cystecto my because  of 
quality  of life concerns  and request  alternative  treatment.  The standard  of care for patients  who 
failed  or d id  not respond to BCG has not changed in over 25 years  and new approaches  are needed 
for this patient populati on. 
 
7) Intravesical  valrubicin  is the only agent approved  by [CONTACT_1622].  It is a modestly  active  agent  in this 
setting, with a 21% CR rate reported in a Phase II study, and a 1-year durable CR of 13%.  It is 
infrequently  used in the urologic  communi ty because of the significant  local toxicity  and short 
durability  of the response.  
 
8) We have  shown that gemcitabine given  twice weekly  was associat ed with minimal  bladder  
irritation  and tolerable myelosuppression.  We proceeded with a Phase II study, documenting a CR of 
50%.  However,  the 1-ye ar durable CR was only 10%,  suggesting a need  for maintenance therapy. 
 
9) There is a clear  need for novel  agents  in BCG-refractory  0is. Furthermore,  an active  agent  that 
can be administered systemically has the added  advantage of potentially  treating  upper tract 
disease,  which  occurs  in 20% of this patient  population.  
 
10) The mTOR  inhibitor  Everolimus  has been  shown to inhibit  protein  synthesis and g rowth  of 
bladder  cancer  cells in vitro.  Everolimus  is efficacious  in treating bladder  cancer cells in vivo. mT OR 
inhibitors  have also shown synergism with gemcitabine in pancreatic  cell lines, supporting  the 
concept  of combination therapy  using  Everolim us with intravesical  gemcitabine.

4.1.2  Proposed  Correl ative Studies  
 
1) Analysis  of pretreatment  tumor  tissue specimens in all patients by [CONTACT_482914]- S6 and phospho- 4E BP1 as well as PTEN,  .phospho -AKT and 
PRAS 40, a downstream  substrate of AKT.  The total number  of unstained slides  required for this is 
10 unstained slides  or 1 paraffin -embedded block. This will not require  research biopsies. 
 
 
The staining will be performed  at the Core  Lab of MSKCC’s  Department  of Patholo gy. The stains  will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_482915] (Hikmat  Al-Ahmadie)  and the staining will be 
graded  as 0 to 3+ (0 = 0-5%; 1+ = 6-25%;  and 3+ = >50%  tumor  cells positive).  
 
2) Pretreatm ent tumor  samples  will be evaluated for PTEN  and PIK3CA mutational  status using 
bidirection al full length  sequencing.  This assay  will be performed  by [CONTACT_482916]/or  the Sequenom  technique at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility  at MSKCC.  This assay will 
require  [ADDRESS_620347] the patient  to take the study  drug exactly  as specified in the protocol.  Patients will be

5.1.1  Drug  Dispensing/Administration  
 
Administration will be pe rformed  on an outpatient basis. Everolimus  will be dispensed as tablets  at 
the beginni ng of each treatment  cycle. In case of dose  modif ication,  patients will be asked to return 
all of their previously  dispensed medication to the clinic and they will be dispensed new- strength 
tablets.  
 
All dosages  prescribed  and dispens ed to the patient  and all dose changes during the study  must be 
recorded.  
 
Medication l abels  will co mply with US legal  requirements  and will be printed in English.  They  will 
supply  no information about  the patient. The storage conditi ons for study  drug will be described o n 
the medication  label.  
 
Everolimus  will be provided by [CONTACT_216775]. Everolimus  is formulated  as tablets for oral administrat ion of 
5mg strength.  Tablets  are blister -packed under  aluminum  foil in units of 10 tablets, w hich should  be 
opened  only at the time of administration as drug is both hygroscopic  and light-sensitive.

Patients  will be observed for DLTs  through one cycle of treatment  (4 weeks) prior to dose esca lation 
for the next dose level.  No intrapat ient dose escalation will occur. DLTs  will be defined as follows, 
using  NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.0:

2)  Febrile  neutropenia (absolute  neutrophil  count (ANC))  < 1000/μL  plus oral temperature to 8.5°C)  
 
3)  Grade  4 neutropenia (ANC  <500 /μL) for ≥ 7 days 
 
4)  Other  grade  4 hematologic  toxicity  
 
5)  Other  nonhematologic  grade  3 or 4 treatment -related toxicity,  excluding n ausea/vomiting,  rash, 
untreated hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_482880]  3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days.

 Patients  whose  treatment  is interrup ted or permanently  discontinued due to an adverse event  or

until the adverse event  or abnormal  laboratory  resolves  or returns to grade 1. If a patient  requires  a

9.3.2  Management  of Stomatitis/Oral Muco sitis/Mouth  Ulcers  
Stomatitis/oral  mucositis/ mouth ulcers  due to Everolimus  should be treated using  local supportive 
care.  Please  note that investigators  in earlier  trials have described the oral toxicities  associat ed with 
Everolimus  as mouth  ulcers,  rather  than mucositis  or stoma titis. If your examination reveals  mouth 
ulcers  rather  than a more  general  inflammation of the mouth,  please classify  the adverse event  as 
such. Please follow  the paradigm  below  for treatment  of stomatitis/oral  mucositis/mouth ulcers:  
 
1.  For mild toxicity  (grade  1), use conservative  measures  such as non-alcoholic  mouth  wash  or 
salt water (0.9% ) mouth wash  several  times  a day until resolution.  
2.  F or  more  severe  toxicity,  (such  as grade 2, in which  case patients  have pain but are a ble to 
maintain adequate oral alimentation,  or grade 3, in which  case patients  cannot  maintain  
adequate oral alimentation),  the suggested treatments  are topi[INVESTIGATOR_482890]  
(i.e., local  anesthetics such  as benzocaine,  butyl amin obenzoate,  tetracaine 
hydrochlor ide, menthol,  or phenol)  with or without  topi[INVESTIGATOR_80118],  such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1%  (Kenalog  in Orabas e®). 
3.  Agents  cont aining hydrogen peroxide,  iodine,  and thyme  derivatives  may tend to worsen  mouth 
ulcers.  It is preferable to avoid  these  agents.  
4.  Antifungal  agents  must be avoided unless  a fungal infection is diagnose d. In particular,  systemic 
imidazole  antifungal  agents (ketoc onazole,  fluconazole,  itraconazole,  etc.) should be avoided in 
all patients due to their strong  inhibition of Everolimus  metabolism,  thereby  [CONTACT_482923].  Therefore,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_482891].  Similarly,  antiviral agen ts such as acyclovir should  be avoided unless  a viral infecti on 
is diagnos ed. 
Note:  Stom atitis/oral mu cositis  should  be appropriately  graded using  the functional  grading  given  on 
the NCI-CTCAE,  version 4.0. 
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_620369] be taken  in the fasting  state.  Grade 2 
hypercholesterolemia  (>300  mg/dL  or 7.75 mmol /L) or grade  2 hypertriglyceridemia (>2.[ADDRESS_620370]) 
should  be treated  with a 3-hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl ( HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor  (e.g., 
atorvastatin,  pravastatin)  or appropriate  lipid-lowering medication,  in addition to diet. Patients  should 
be monitored clinically  and through serum  biochemistry  for the development  of rhabdomyo lysis and 
other  adverse events  as required in the product  label/data sh eets for HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors.

 Note:  Concomitant  therapy  with fibrates  and an HMG- CoA reductase in hibitor  is associated with an 
increased risk of a rare but serious  skeletal  muscle toxicity  manifested by [CONTACT_090],  markedly 
elevated creatine kinase (CPK)  levels and myoglobinuria,  acute  renal  failure,  and, sometimes,  
death.  The risk versus  benefit  of using  this therapy should  be determined for individ ual patients 
based on their risk of cardiovascular  complicati ons of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
 
Grade  3 hyperglycemia has been ob served  in patients  receiving Everolimus  therapy.  In many  cases 
in study  Everolimus  C2222,  the affected  patients  had an abnormal fasting  glucose at baseline. 
Monitoring of fasting  serum glucose is recommended prior to the start of everolimus  therapy  and 
periodically  thereafter.  Based  on this finding,  it is suggested t hat optimal  glucose con trol should b e 
achieved before starting  a patient  on Everoli mus and should be monitored during  Everoli mus 
therapy.  
 
 
 
9.3.4  Management  of non-infectious  pneumonitis

(grade  2 = not interfering with activities  of daily living, or grade  3 = interf ering with activities  of daily 
living  and oxygen  indica ted) have  been  noted  in patients  receiving Everolimus  therapy. 
Noninfectio us pneumonitis  has been  associat ed with Everolimus  and other  mT OR  inhibitors.(40)  In 
order  to monitor  for asymptomatic  (grade  1) pulmonary infiltrates,  a chest X-ray is required  if a CT 
scan of chest is not used for bimonthly  disease evaluations.  Additional  chest CT scans may be 
performed,  when clinic ally necessa ry. If noninfectious  pneumonitis  develops,  a consultation  with a 
pulmonologist  should be considered.  If the patient develops  grade 3 pneumonitis,  treatment  with 
Everolimus  should  be interrupted and the patient  should be treated  as medically  indicated (short 
course corticosteroids,  oxygen,  etc.).

Patients  will be instructed not to take any additional  medicat ions (inclu ding over-the-counter  products)  
during the course of the study without  prior consulta tion with the investigato r. At each visit, the 
investig ator will ask the patient  about any new medications  he/she  is or has taken after the start of the 
study  drug.  
 
All Concomitant  medications/Significant  non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482892] ≤30 days prior to start and after 
start of study drug,  including physical therapy  and blood transfusions, sh ould be recorded.  
 
The followi ng restrictio ns apply  during  the entire duration of the study: 
 
• No other  investigation al therapy  should  be given to patients.  
 
• No anticancer  agents  other than the study  medication  should be given to patients.  If such agen ts 
are required for a patient, then the patient must  first be withd rawn from the study. 
• Co-administration  with strong  inhibi tors of CYP3 A4 (e.g.,  ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  ritonavir)  or 
P-gp should  be avoided  
 
• Seville  orange,  star fruit, grapefruit,  and their juices affect  P450 and P- gp activity. Concomitant 
use should be avoided  
• Co-administration  with moderate CYP3A4  inhibitors  (e.g.,  erythromycin, fluconaz ole) or P-gp 
inhibitors  should be used with caution. If patient  requires  co-a dministrati on of moderate CYP3A4

 inhibitors  or P-gp inhibit ors, reduce  the dose  of Everolimus  to half the currently  used dose. 
Additional  dose reducti ons to every  other  day may be required  to manage toxicities.  If the 
inhibitor  is discontinued,  the Everolimus  dose sho uld be returned to the dose used  prior to 
initiation  of the moderate CYP3A4 /P-gp inhibit or. 
• Avoid  the use of strong  CYP3A4  inducers. 
 
• No chronic  treatment  with systemic steroids  or other immun osuppressive agents  (at a dose 
equivalent  or greater  than 20 mg prednisone per day).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_482893].  
• Everolimus  may affect t he response to vaccinations, making  the response to the vaccination le ss 
effective. Live vaccines should be avoided while  a patient  is treated  with Everolimus.  
 
• Oral anticoa gulants  such as warfarin are CYP2 C9 substrat es and, as such, no interaction  with 
Everolimus  is expected.  However,  drug-drug interaction stud ies between macrolide antibiotics 
and warfarin  have  produced  mixed  outcomes  and the disparity  in these findings  has led to the 
conclusion t hat multiple  factors  may alter the clearance  of warfarin.  The co-administ ration  of 
Everolimus  and oral anticoagulants  is possi ble but should be subject  to verification  of 
coagulation (INR)  once  steady  state is reached ( after one week’s  treatm ent).

11.0TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS 
 
Known Undesirable  Side Effects  of Everolimus  
 
Overall,  the most  frequent  adverse effects  suspected  to be re lated to Everolimus  have  been 
stomatitis, r ash, anemia,  fatigue,  asthenia,  diarrhea, anorexia,  nausea,  hypercholeste rolemia, 
mucosal  inflammation,  vomiting,  hypertriglycerid emia,  cough,  peripheral  edema,  dry skin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], 
pruritus,  and dyspnea.  The most common  grade [ADDRESS_620397]  of rapamycins (sirolimus,  temsirolimus,  and everolimus). 
Numerous  case reports  in the literat ure suggest  that rapamy cin-associat ed pneumonitis  is relatively 
unaggressive,  limited  in extent,  and reversible upon  drug discontinuation.  The term ‘pneumonitis’  is 
used  here to describe no ninfectious, nonmalignant  infiltration  in the lungs,  which  is evident 
radiologic ally. More  precise diagn osis should  follow histocytological  examination following lung 
biopsy,  generally  during  bronchosc opy that may or may not be symptoma tic. 
 
In oncology  studies  with Everolimus,  severe  pneumonitis  susp ected as drug-related has been 
reported  as a serious  adverse event  on 13 occasions  and additionally  in the following  associat ed 
preferred terms,  includi ng acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_41333] (n=2),  alveolitis  (n=1)  and allergic 
alveolitis  (n=1), interstitial  lung disease (n=10),  lung infiltration (n=23),  cryptogenic  organizing 
pneumonia,  lung consolidation,  pulmonary  alveol ar hemorrh age, pulmonary  toxicity,  and pulmonary

 fibrosis  (n=1, each).  One fatal case of drug- related pneumonitis  was reported for a patient  with 
metastatic  infiltrating  ductal carcin oma of the breast  treated with 10 mg/day,  which  developed 
approximat ely 2 months  after starting  Everolimu s. Cytologies  for both the pleural  and pericardial fluids  
were  positive  for malignancy.  The death  was conside red possibly  related  to the underlying  late stage 
tumor  and study  drug.  Addition ally, 1 patient treated  with 10 mg/day  died due to severe  acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_482896]. Thoracic  computed tomography  (CT) scan 
demonstrated condensa tion in the majority  of the left lower  lobe and frosted glass  appearance in the 
left upper  lobe, lingula,  and right lung. 
 
Along with the cases  of noninfectious pneumonitis,  serious opportunistic  infectio ns have also been 
reported  in cancer  patien ts treated  with Everolim us: mycobacterium, aspergillus,  and fatal candida l 
sepsis, and fatal pneumocystis  carinii, in particul ar. Because Everolimus,  as other  rapamycins, 
inhibits  proliferation of activated lymphocytes  and reduces  neutrophil  counts, treatment  with 
Everolimus  must  be considered as predisposing patients  to the risk of infection.  This risk will b e 
higher  in patients severe ly immuno compromised because  of their underlying disease and/or  co- 
medications.  Outcome  may be fatal in case of serious  infections. 
 
A reduction  in blood  cell counts  is frequent  when Everolimus  therapy  is initiated.  Without clinical 
significance  and infreque ntly, anemia and thrombocytopenia  have been reported.  In heavily 
pretreated patients  with aggressive lymph oma, the inciden ce of grade  3 anemia,  neutropenia,  and 
thrombocyt openia was reported  to be 11%,  16%,  and 30%,  respectively. Serious,  suspected drug- 
related  hemorrhages  have been exceptional.  Nevertheless,  Everolimus  should  be considered as 
predisposi ng patients  to hemorrhage,  potentially  fatal, should  they develop severe drug-related 
thrombocyt openia.  
 
Discrete,  reversible cha nges  in liver enzymes  have  been  found  to occur  in numerous  patients  during 
treatment  with Everolim us in oncology clinical stu dies and in a study  in rheumatoid arthritis.  In 
oncology  studies,  these  changes  may be evident only in patients  witho ut severe underlying  morbidity. 
The increase in aspartate  transaminase (AST)  and alanine transaminase (ALT)  generally  appears 
after 4 weeks  of treatment.  In all but a few cases it does not exceed grade  1 (≤2.5 x UL N). Similarly, 
mild increas es in alkaline  phosphatas es can coexist. Spontaneous  corrections  or intermittent 
correction w ith continu ed treatment  can occur.  Serum  bilirub in is not increased.  In studies  of patients 
with advanced cancers,  clinic ally relevant  changes  in liver enzymes  have been  invariably  associated 
with the prese nce of liver metastases  and/or  progression of the underlying  cancer.  
 
Renal  failure has been  reported  in 5 suspected cases to date. One patient  with no alternative 
explanation made  a complete recovery following  study  drug adjustment  and no treatment/therapy  for 
the event.  The rest of the patients  had concurr ent morbidities,  which  might  have contributed to the 
reported  events. 
 
Hypophosphatemia,  hypomagnesemia,  hypona tremia,  and hypocalcemia have  been  reported  as 
serious  adverse reacti ons. Electrol ytes should be monitored  in patients  treated  with Everolimus.  
More  detailed information regarding Everolimus  reported suspected toxicities  and individual  cases  is 
provided in the [Investigator’s  Brochure].

12.0CRITERIA  FOR  THERAP EUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Complete response (CR) is defined  as no evidence of disease (by [CONTACT_482924]). 
Progression is defined as the development  of invasion  or metastasis. If the patient  develops  a 
recurrence,  they will be considered having  failed treatment.  Patients  will also be considered  having 
failed  treatment  if there is no respo nse to treatment  after two cycles. 
 
 
Patients  will receive  cystoscopy and cytology every 3 months.  If a sus pi[INVESTIGATOR_482897] y 
or cytology  is found,  then a TUR will be performed no later than 4 weeks  from the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]/ positive  
test to determine presence  or absence of disease.  For purposes  of the primary  endpoint,  patients 
demonstrating a CR at 11 months  will un dergo cystoscopy and cytology  (and if suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665], t hen a 
TUR)  between 11 and 13 months.  
 
 
13.0CRITERIA FOR  REMOVAL  FROM STUDY  
 
If at any time the patient  develops  progressive disease he/she will be taken  off study  and referred for 
alternative therapy.  
 
If at any time the patient  develops  unacceptable toxicity  he/she  will be re moved from study. 
 
If at any point  a patient  develops  any grade  4 toxicity  suspected to be related to gemcitabine,  the 
patient  will be taken  off study. 
 
If a patient  requires  a dose delay  from Everoli mus of >[ADDRESS_620398] be disco ntinued from the study. 
If the patient  requires  a dose delay  from gemcit abine of >14 days, the patient  will be taken  off study. 
If at anytime  the patient  is found  to be ineligib le for the protocol  as desig nated in the section on 
Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligib ility (i.e., a change in diagn osis), the patient will be removed from 
the study.  
 
Patients  who are removed from study  due to withdrawal  of consent,  lost to follow -up, or 
administrat ive problems  should not be consider ed unevaluable and will be replaced.  
 
 
 
14.0BIOS TATISTI CS 
 
Basis  for sample size 
 
Phase  I: Patients  will be accrued in the standard 3+3 fashion such that the MTD is the dose level at 
which  no more than 1 out of 6 patients experience DLT.  This portion will accrue  between 2 and 18 
patients.

 Phase  II: The purpose  of this phase  of the study  is to assess the efficacy of gemcitabine plus 
Everolimus  in patients  with BCG-refractory  disease.  The primary  endpoint  will be the proportion of 
patients  who are disease- free at 1 year following start of therapy.  
 
Historically,  only about  10% of patie nts in this sett ing will be disease- free 1 year following therapy, 
therefore a 1- year disease -free rate of 10% would be consi dered not promising,  while  a 30% rate 
would be considered prom ising.  We have chosen  a single -stage design  and set the type I (falsely 
accepting a non-promising  therapy)  and type II error  (falsely  rejecting a p romising  therapy)  rates  at 
0.05 and 0.10, respectiv ely. This portion of the study will enroll  33 patien ts (6 can be carried  over 
from the MTD cohort  of the phase I p ortion).  If there are 7 or more  who are disease-fr ee at 1 year, 
the treatment  will be de clared  effec tive and worthy  of further  testing.  
 
In order  to confirm  the safety  of the regimen,  patients  will con tinuously  be monitored  for excessive 
toxicity  and early stopp ing rules  for toxicity  will be em ployed.  Unaccept able toxicity  is defined  as any 
grade 3 or higher  local toxicity  including hematuria,  urgency,  and frequency. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482898] e provided in the table below.

Secondary  endpoints  
 
a)  To determine  the CR rate (by [CONTACT_482901]) in patients  receiving Everol imus in 
combination with intravesical gemci tabine.  We will ca lculate  the proporti on of patients  who 
demonstrate CR at any time within  the year following start of therapy,  with a 95% confidence 
interval.  With 33 patient s, we will be able to estimate  this proportion within +/- 18%.  
 
b)  To determine  the survival of patients treated  with Everolim us in combi nation with intravesical 
gemcitabine.  Overall  survival following  start of therapy  will be estimated using Kaplan- Meier 
methods.  
 
c)  To evaluate for activated mTOR  pathway  markers  as well as PTEN  status  and AKT 
activation in all pretreatment  and analysis  of posttreatment  specimens  when  availabl e. These 
analyses  will be descript ive in nature and will be used to generate  hypotheses  for future 
studies.  mTOR and PTEN status  will be summarized descriptively,  overall  and separately  for 
those  with and without  a CR.

16.1Quality  Assurance  
 
 
 
Monthly  registration  reports will be ge nerated to monitor  patient  accruals and completeness  of 
registration data.  Routine  data quality reports  will be generated  to assess missing  data and 
incons istencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be 
monitored periodical ly throughout  the study  period  and potential problem s will be brought  to the 
attention  of the study  team  for discussion and action. Random -sample d ata quality  and protocol 
compliance audits  will be conducted by [CONTACT_279143] a minim um of two times  per year,  more 
frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.2Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center  were 
approved by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new policies 
set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Canc er Institute  for Data and 
Safety  Moni toring  of Clinical Trials,”  which  can be found  at: 
http://cance rtrials.nci.nih. gov/researchers/dsm/index.htm l. The DSM  Plans at MSKCC  were 
established and are monitored  by [CONTACT_482926].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring Plans  can be found on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://m skweb2. mskcc.o rg /irb/index .htm 
 
 
There are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  and 
quality.  There are institu tional processes  in place  for quality  assurance (e.g., protocol  monitoring, 
compliance and data verification  audits,  therapeu tic response,  and staff education on clinic al 
research QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control, plus there are two institution al 
committees  that are responsible for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The 
committees,  Data and Safety  Monitoring Commit tee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials and the 
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials,  report to the Center’s 
Research  Council  and Institution al Review  Board. 
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each pr otocol  will be assessed for its level of 
risk and degree of monitoring requi red. Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house 
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperat ive group,  etc.) will be addressed and the monitoring 
procedures  will be estab lished  at the time of protocol  activat ion.

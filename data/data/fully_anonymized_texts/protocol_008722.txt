response
x To explore the association of vaccine response with treatment
STUDY DESIGN General design
Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study assessing the effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181149] (SC) for 52 weeks in patients with persistent asthma. 
Periods
The clinical trial consists of 3 periods:
x Screening Period (4±1 weeks): to determine a patient’s eligibility 
status and establish level of asthma control before randomization
x Treatment Period (52 weeks): treat with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328639]     
x Post-treatment Period (12 weeks): to monitor a patient’s status 
when off study drug treatment for patients not participating in the 
long term extension study
Screening Period
Prior to screening, patients must be on a stable background therapy of a 
medium to high dose of inhaled corticos teroid (ICS) in combination with a 
second controller medication (eg, long-acting beta agonist [LABA], leukotriene 
receptor antagonist [LTRA], methylxanthine s, etc) for at least 3 months with a 
stable dose PRQWKSULRUWR9LVLW3DWLHQWVUHTXLULQJDWKLUGFRQWUROOH UDUH

The Screening Period will be 4±1 w eeks (21-35 days) in duration.
Randomized Treatment Period
Patients will be randomized to either dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328640] a treatment duration of 52 weeks.
During the Randomized Treatment Period, patients will continue the stable 
dose(s) of controller medication used during the Screening Period. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and 
encouraged to return to the site for study visits and participate in assessments 
according to the visit schedule until the end of the study with a +/-5 day window (See study flowchart for patients after permanent treatment
discontinuation in Section 1.3). At the time of permanent treatment 
discontinuation, patients will perform early treatment discontinuation visit 
(ETD) with all the assessments defined fo r Visit 18 (EOT). Under exceptional 
circumstances when a patient cannot come to the site for the scheduled visit, 
a phone contact [CONTACT_328722]. During the 
phone contact, at least information about AEs, concomitant medication and asthma exacerbation events should be collected. In addition, patients who 
discontinue early from treatment or pati ents who choose not to participate in 
the open label extension (OLE) study may be asked to return to the clinic to 
have additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall 
assessment of antibody titers and/or clinical presentation at the time of
discontinuation or at the time of last study visit.
Post-treatment Period
After completing the treatment period, patients will be evaluated for [ADDRESS_405862]-
treatment period of this trial.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination:   
The sample size calculation of this study was based on a comparison 
between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] [ADDRESS_405871] to the 2 primary 
endpoints: annualized rate of severe exacerbations during the 52-week 
treatment period and absolute change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12. 
Assuming the number of severe exacerbations follows a negative binomial 
distribution with a dispersion parameter of 2, a placebo annualized rate of exacerbations being 0.6, a randomization ratio of 2:2:1:1, with 1638 randomized patients (546 for each dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328646] 273 for each 
matching placebo group), the study will have 99% power to detect a 55% 
relative risk reduction (ie, annualized rate of 0.27 for the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24769]) in 
the annualized rate of severe exacerbations at the 2-tailed significance level RIĮ $VVXPLQJSDWLHQWVZLWKDEDVHOLQHHRVLQRSKLOFRX QW
cells/μL (0.3 giga/L), approximately 690 patients (230 for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300mg 
q2w and 115 for the matching placebo) will provide 91% power to detect a 55% relative risk reduction for the subgroup. Assuming a common standard 
deviation of 0.5 L, 1638 patients will prov ide 98% power to detect a treatment 
difference of 0.15 L in the change of FEV1 from baseline at Week 12 for the 
overall population, and 690 patients will provide 88% power to detect a treatment difference of 0.18 L for patients with a baseline eosinophil count FHOOV  ō(0.3 giga/L). The overall study re cruitment will continue until at

Patients will be randomized using a 2:2:1:1 randomization ratio for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
300 mg q2w, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 200 mg q2w, placebo q2w in 2 mL and placebo q2w

Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<18 years, \HDUV at screening,

dose level (medium, high) and country.
In addition, in order to have additional patients treated with drug 
manufactured using the intended comme rcial process, approximately 220 
patients will be randomized in addition to the originally planned sample size (1638).
Analysis populations:
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be intent-to-
treat (ITT) population defined as a ll randomized patients. The efficacy 
analyses will be conducted according to the treatment to which they are 
randomized.
The secondary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be HEos

eosiQRSKLOFRXQW cells/PL 
The analysis population for the safety endpoints will be the safety population, 
defined as all patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount 
of treatment administered. The safety analyses will be conducted according to 
the treatment that patients actually received.
Analysis of the primary endpoints: 
The annualized rate of severe exacerbation events will be analyzed using a 
negative binomial regression model. The model will include the total number 
of events occurring during the 52 weeks as the response variable, with the treatment group, age, region (pooled country), baseline eosinophil strata, 
baseline ICS dose level and number of severe exacerbation events within [ADDRESS_405873] model with 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach.  The model will include change from 
baseline FEV 1values up to Week 12 as response variables, and factors for 
treatment, age, sex, height, region (pooled country), baseline eosinophil
strata, baseline ICS dose level, visit, treatment by-visit interaction, baseline FEV
1value, and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates. An unstructured 
correlation matrix will be used to model t he within-patient errors. Parameters 
will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method using the 
Newton-Raphson algorithm. Statistical in ferences on treatment comparisons

Multiplicity considerations 
To strongly control the type-I error rate for the primary family (2 primary 
endpoints and 2 doses), a hierarchical testing procedure will be applied at a 
2-sided 5% significant level, ie, each hypothesis will be formally tested only if 
the preceding one is significant at the 5% level. The hierarchy of the tests will 
be: 1) annualized severe exacerbation rate  for 300mg q2w versus placebo, 2) 
absolute change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 for 300mg q2w versus 
placebo, 3) annualized severe exacerbation rate for 200mg q2w versus placebo and 4) absolute change from baseline in FEV
1at Week 12 for 200mg 
q2w versus placebo.
If both doses are significant for both primary endpoints, a selective set of 
secondary endpoints will be tested following a hierarchical testing procedure 
at a 2-sided 5% significant level. The first four tests will be 1) % change from 
baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 for 300 mg q2w versus placebo 2) absolute 
change from baseline in AQLQ global score at Week 12 for 300 mg q2w versus placebo 3) % change from baseline in FEV
1at Week 12 for 200 mg 
q2w versus placebo, 4) absolute change from baseline in AQLQ global score 
at Week [ADDRESS_405875] of secondary 
endpoints to be tested in the hierarchical  order will be spec ified in SAP. The 
overall familywise error rate will be strongly controlled at a 2-sided 5% level for all tested endpoints across dose groups.
Handling of missing data
Sensitivity analyses excluding the additi onal off-treatment measurements will 
be performed to corroborate the primar y analyses. The reason and pattern of 
missing data will be carefully examined and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_328647].
Analysis of other secondary endpoints 
The annualized rate of exacerbation events, including severe exacerbation 
events resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328648], will be analyzed using the same way as for severe exacerbation events.
Time to severe exacerbation will be analyzed using a Cox regression model
with time to event as the dependent variable, and treatment, age, region 
(pooled country), baseline eosinophil strata, baseline ICS dose level and
number of asthma events prior to the study as covariates. The Kaplan-Meier 
method will be used to derive the proportion of patients with an asthma exacerbation event at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52, specific to each treatment 
group.
The change from baseline for continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a 
MMRM in the same fashion as for the endpoint of FEV
1. Sex and height will 
be included as covariates only in the models for spi[INVESTIGATOR_328649]. .
The safety variables, including AEs, l aboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG, 
and physical examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

iEvery 2 week (q2w) investigational product administrations must be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 11 days. The randomized Treatment Peri od visits occur every 2 weeks up to Week 12 and then every 4 weeks, alternating 
with q2w home administration of IMP (patient, caregiver, or health care professional) without study visit up to the end of treat ment period at Week 52. After Week 12, if the patient or Investigator decides not to 
administer IMP at home, the IMP injections can be performed at th e site by [CONTACT_181252]. Patients will be monitore d at the study site for a minimum of [ADDRESS_405878] 12 weeks. 
jElectronic diary/PEF meter is used for daily recording of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol use, asthma contr oller drug use, oral steroid requirements, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma 
symptoms, morning and evening asthma symptom NRS scores and AM and PM PEF. This device is dispensed at Visit 1 and information is downloaded from this device on the other indicated days.
kACQ-7 is completed in the patient’s electronic diary during clinic visits. ACQ-7 (Asthma Control Questionnaire 7-question version ) score will be used to follow up evaluations in all patients.  ACQ-5 (the first 5 items 
of the ACQ-7) score is used for eligibility evaluation at visit [ADDRESS_405879] of 1 hour.
mVital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per  minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths per minute), body temper ature (degrees Celsius) and body weight (kg) will be measured at the screening and 
randomization visits (Visits 1 and 2) and every subsequent visi t. Height (cm) will be measured only at screening (Visit 1) for a dults, and be measured at the screening and randomization visits (Visits 1 and 2) and 
every subsequent visit for adolescents. Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same arm at each visit, a nd will be measured prior to receiving inve stigational product at the clinic visits.

oHematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell (WBC) count with five-part differential count, diffe rential count, and total red blood cell count. Serum chemistry: creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen, glucose, uric acid, total cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal ra nge, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), bicarbonat e, and creatine phosphokinase. Clinical laboratory testing at Visit 1 and Visit 17 
(only applicable for patients who plan to participate in the OLE study) include hepatitis screen covering hepatitis B surface anti gen (HBs Ag), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs Ab), hepatitis B core antibody (HBc
Ab) including HBcAb IgM and total, hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCV Ab), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screen (Anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). In case of results 
showing HBs Ag (negative), and HBc Ab total (positive), a hepa titis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) testing must be performed prior to ran domization to determine eligibility. In case of results showing HCV Ab (positive), a

4.2.1 Population rationale 
In this study, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328658]-on to an inha led corticosteroid in combination with one or 
two other controller medications in patients with persistent asthma.  The population is comprised 
of patients with a phys ician diagnosis of DVWKPDIRUP onths, based on the Global Initiative for 
Asthma (GINA) 2014 Guidelines (3) and entry cr iteria described in Section 7. As described 
above, in addition to suffering the symptoms associ ated with a lack of asthma control, such 
patients utilize a disproportionate level of health  care services, may suffe r the long term adverse 
effects of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids, and ultimately, are at increased risk of a severe asthma exacerbation.
4.2.2 Design rationale
This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-contro lled, parallel group study. The clinical 
trial consists of three periods, using an add-on therapy approach to inhaled corticosteroid in 
combination with one or two other controller medicines: 
xScreening Period (4±1 weeks)
xRandomized Treatment Period (52 weeks)
xPost-treatment Period (12 weeks)
This study has two arms of placebo with different  volume, which is to match the different dose 
regimens of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg q2w and 200 mg  q2w respectively. Both the patient and 
investigator will be blinded to assigned active drug or placebo, but will not be blinded to the dose 
level of  dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg/matching placebo or   dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 200 mg/matching placebo due to 
different volume size (2 mL vs 1.14 mL).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - Page 344.2.4 Rationale for dose and regimen selection 
The dose regimens of subcutaneous (SC) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328661] 300 mg every 
2 weeks (q2w) or [ADDRESS_405900] 3%, partially controlled or 
uncontrolled by [INVESTIGATOR_49377]-to-high doses of IC S plus LABA (fluticasone/salmeterol, 
budesonide/formoterol, or mometasone/formote rol) were randomized to the study. The study 
showed significant efficacy in a population of mostly severe asth matics with poor asthma control 
and decreased lung function with mostly high do ses of ICS in combination with a LABA.  
In the dose ranging study (DRI12544 study), 776 patie nts with asthma uncontrolled by [INVESTIGATOR_49377]-
to-high dose ICS plus LABA were randomized in the study. Four dose regimens (300 mg q2w 
with 600mg loading dose, 200 mg q2w with 400mg loading dose, 300mg q4w with 600 mg 
loading dose and 200mg q4w with 400 mg loading dose) were tested in the study. The results 
showed that [ADDRESS_405901] proposed 
adult Phase 3 dose (300 mg q2w) is not expected  to exceed the observed adult exposure at the
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328662] 300 mg once weekl y, which was observed to be generally well 
tolerated in adults. Therefore, adolescent dos ing at 300 mg q2w or 200 mg q2w regimen is 
expected to yield dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328663] a height ened safety risk in this age population.

(S[LOCATION_003]R) has also been low. In addition, no im balance in the frequency of TEAEs between 
patients treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_328666], with the exception of injection 
site reactions, nasopharyngitis and headache. In summary, the safety data observed so far in

[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized treatment period
During this period, patients will cont inue to take their controller  medication(s) used during the 
screening period. The dose and regimen should not be  changed. Only a transient increase in dose 
of ICS in addition to other rescue medication will  be allowed to treat acute symptoms of asthma 
as per investigator's guidance. This will be recorded in the eDiary.
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-treatment period
Upon completing the randomized treatment period , patients not continuing with the open label 
extension study will proceed to be  treated with the controller me dication regimen and dose used 
during the randomized treatment period, which coul d be adjusted based on the medical judgment 
of the investigator of the pa tients’ asthma control status. 
8.2.2 Reliever medication
The reliever medication will not be dispensed or supplied by [CONTACT_456]. 
Patients may administer albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol MDI as reliever 
medication as needed during the study. Nebulizer so lutions may be used as an alternative delivery 
method.  
The description of the criterion for qualifying an asthma exacerbation event based on nebulizer 
using, will use the nebulizer-to-puff conversion fact or for application to loss of asthma control 
(LOAC) definition.

Study patients, Investigators, and study site pe rsonnel will not have access to the randomization

8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study
In case of an adverse event (A E), the code should only be br oken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_328728] (IVRS)/interact ive web response system (IWRS) and/or by [CONTACT_328729].   If the blind is broken, the Investigator 
should document the date, time of day and reason for code breaking.   
Subject withdrawal will only occur when the code break call is ma de at the site level, not the 
study level. This means that if the Emergenc y Unblinding transaction is performed by [CONTACT_1275] (ie, at the site level), then the subjec t will be withdrawn from treatment. However, if 
the Emergency Unblinding transaction is performed by [CONTACT_125460] (GSO) (ie, at the 
study level, as the GSO is not site based), then the subject will not be withdrawn from treatment.
At the facilities where the systemic drug con centration measurements, anti-drug antibodies and 
selected biomarkers are determined, the samples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to unblinding of responsible bioanalysts. Bioana lysts are excluded from the clinical trial team.
Patients, investigators and site personnel will not have access to assay results for 
immunoglobulins (IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA and Ig M) after the first administration of study 
medication because these values have the potential for unblinding.  Furthermore, neither patients, investigators nor site personnel will have access to eotaxin-3, antigen-specific IgE, total IgE, 
Eosinophil Cationic Protein (ECP),  TARC or periostin while the study is ongoing, as the related 
data are not essential for patient care and have the potential for unblinding.

Patients should complete the following PROs before spi[INVESTIGATOR_328693]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ (S)
The AQLQ (S) was designed as a self-administere d patient reported outcome to measure the 
functional impairments that are most troublesome to patients as a result of their asthma (seeAppendix F). The instrument is comprised of 32 ite ms, each rated on a 7-point Likert scales from 
1 to 7. The AQLQ(S) has 4 domains. The domains and the number of items in each domain are as 
follows: 
xSymptoms (12 items)
xActivity limitation (11 items)
xEmotional function (5 items) 
xEnvironmental Stimuli (4 items) 
A global score is calculated ranging from 1 to 7 and a score by [CONTACT_121982]. Higher scores indicate 
better quality of life.
The instrument has been used in many clinical tr ials, and it has been shown to be reliable, valid 
(patient interviews), and sensitive to change. The MCID for AQLQ(S) is 0.5 (11).

comprised of 14 items: 7 related to anxiety and 7 to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is 
scored from 0-3; one can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. 
The HADS was found to perform well in assessi ng anxiety disorders a nd depression in both 
somatic and psychiatric cases and (not only in hosp ital practice for which it was first designed) in 
primary care patients and the general population (13). The MID for the HADS-A (anxiety) has

EQ-5D-5L is a standardized heal th-related quality of life ques tionnaire developed by [CONTACT_185250] a simple, generic measur e of health for clinical and economic appraisal 
(18). EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by [CONTACT_1962]. 
The EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 pages – th e EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ VAS (see
Appendix I). The EQ-5D descriptiv e system comprises 5 dimensions : mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort and a nxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, 
slight problems, moderate probl ems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS) records the respondent’s se lf-rated health on a vert ical visual analogue 
scale. The EQ VAS ‘thermometer’ has endpoints of 100 (Best imaginable health state) at the top 
and 0 (Worst imaginable health state) at the bo ttom. The MCID for the EQ-5D in asthma patients 
has been reported to be in the range of .001 to 0.074 (19, 20)

9.2.2 Safety and tolerability endpoints
The same safety assessments will be applied ac ross all arms.  Adverse events, including serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of spec ial interest (AESI), will  be collected at every 
visit. The Investigator will ask the patient how he /she has felt since the last study visit. The study 
specific and general safety criter ia are detailed in Section 10.4.1. To assure the continuing safety 
of patients in this study, an independent DMC will be responsible for reviewing the safety data on 
a periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in Section 6.4.
Safety observations 
xThe Investigator should take a ll appropriate measures to ensure  the safety of the patients. 
Notably, he/she should follow up the outcome of  SAEs /AESI until clin ical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal or until progression has been 
stabilized or death. In all cases, this may im ply that observations will continue beyond the 
last planned visit per protocol , and that additional investigat ions may be requested by [CONTACT_429]. 
xWhen treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485]. 
xIn case of any SAE/AESI with immediate no tification brought to th e attention of the 
Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her 
to be caused by [CONTACT_7198] w ith a reasonable possibility, this should be 
reported to the Sponsor.

analyses.
The blood DNA sample, and the DNA or RNA that is extracted, will be assigned a second
number, a Genetic ID (de- identification code) that is different  from the Subject ID. This “double 
coding” is performed to separate a su bject’s medical information and DNA data.
The clinical study data (coded by S ubject ID) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environment from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by [CONTACT_328743]). The key linking Subject ID and

Patients will be encouraged to provide vaccinatio n plans for the following vaccines, tetanus (alone 
or combined), any injectable influenza, any pne umococcal and any meningococcal, which are in 
line with the patients age and local medical practi ce (live attenuated vaccin es are excluded) during 
the study. Subjects planning to receive any of th e above listed vaccines during the study may 
optionally sign a separate informed consent for co llection of 2 blood samples for assay of vaccine
IgG in serum for each vaccine: the first should be drawn within 6 weeks pr ior to vaccination and 
then the second should be drawn 3 to 4 weeks afte r vaccination (up to [ADDRESS_405952] allowed).
Vaccinations should preferably occur after comple tion of at least 12 weeks of treatment, while 
remaining in compliance with the patient’s r ecommended immunization schedule. Pre-vaccine 
blood sample collection will not ta ke place until patient is on treatment of IMP for at least 6 
weeks. Blood collections should be c onducted at regularly scheduled stud y visits but, if this is not 
feasible, could also be done at unscheduled vis its. The details on the date(s) of vaccination and the 
specific vaccines that are administered, such as brand and antigenic strain s, should be collected

blood samples will be collected at the visit specifi ed in the study flow chart, 15 mL each, will be 
collected into a dry, red topped tube (or into smal ler tubes of equivalent total volume) kept at 
room temperature for 30 minutes and then centr ifuged at approximately 1500 g for 10 minutes at 
room temperature.  The serum will then be transferred, in equal portions, into 3 storage tubes, 
which will be immediately capped and frozen in an upright position at -20°C or colder. 
These archived serum samples, and any residual  or leftover serum, pl asma or blood remaining 
from planned laboratory work, may be used for research purposes  related to asthma 
(eg, exploratory biomarkers of disease or drug e ffect), additional drug safety assessments or 
development and validation of bioassay methods  beyond those defined in the present protocol. 
These samples will remain labelle d with the same identifiers as  the ones used during the study 
(ie, subject ID, sample ID). They will be transfer red to a [COMPANY_011] site (or a subcontractor site) 
which can be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. The Sponsor has 
included safeguards for protecting subject confid entiality and personal data (see Section 14.3 and

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
The clinical trial consists of three periods, using an add-on therapy approach to inhaled 
corticosteroid in combination with on e or two other controller medications:
xScreening Period (4±1 weeks; Visit 1) 
xRandomized Treatment Period ( 52 weeks; Visits 2-18) 
xPost-treatment Period (1 2 weeks; Visits 19-21) 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (relativ e to the first injection) , as scheduled. The visit 
schedule should be adhered to w ithin the ± [ADDRESS_405955] s. However, if the visit can only be done at a 
different time of the day and the patient is not fa sting, then he/she should be advised to have a 
light meal and the site should document that se rum chemistry was not obtained under fasting 
conditions. For spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], it should be performed at approximately the same time of the day at 
each visit throughout the study. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for study visits and particip ate in assessments according to the visit schedule 
until the end of the study with a +/-5 day window (See Section 1.3). Under exceptional 
circumstances when a patient cannot come to the site for the scheduled vi sit, a phone contact [CONTACT_328744]. Duri ng the phone contact, at least information about 
AEs, concomitant medication and asthma exacerbation events should be collected. 
Patients who discontinue early from treatment or  patients who choose not to participate in the 
OLE study may be asked to return to the clinic  to have additional ADA samples collected for 
analysis based on the overall assessment of anti body titers and/or clinical presentation at the time 
of discontinuation or at th e time of last study visit.
Reminder: sexually active female patients of re productive potential are re quired to practice an 
effective contraception throughout the participati on in the study including a 12-week period after
last IMP dose. Sites should c ounsel these patients, with spec ial attention towards adolescent 
patients regarding the importance of practicing responsible and effective contraception throughout 
the participation in the study including  a 12-week period af ter last IMP dose.
Prior to all screening assessments, after discus sion of participation in the study, the written 
consent form (including voluntar y participation in pharmacogenetic  testing/future use of blood 
samples/vaccination testing) must be signed and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this stud y are grouped under the heading of a single visit 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be pe rformed over more than 1 site visit if necessary, as

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - Page 70long as the screening visit window prior to randomization (Day 1) is respected. If certain dynamic 
laboratory tests do not meet the e ligibility criteria, these laborato ry assessments may be repeated, 
at the discretion of the investigator, if it is j udged to be likely to return to acceptable range for 
study inclusion within the screen ing visit window (35 days) prior to Day1. These patients do not 
need to sign a new ICF and be allocated a ne w patient number within this same screening 
window.  
Patients that fail the initial screening for exclus ion criteria, eg, concomitant medications, may be 
rescreened for study eligibility [ADDRESS_405956] sign a new 
consent form and will be allocated a new patient number; all of the Visit [ADDRESS_405957] be 
repeated (refer to Section 8.4 for further instru ctions related to rescreening) unless a prior 
assessment is performed within the ti me frame permitted prior to study entry. 
Patients that fail the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or Randomization Visit (Visit 2) because of eDiary 
/spi[INVESTIGATOR_181218], or patient-relate d / site personnel-relate d unintentional errors 
may be rescreened one time after approval is gran ted by [CONTACT_1034]’s clinical study director. In 
every case of rescreen allowance due to tech nical equipment malfunction and/or unintentional 
human error(s), the Study Investigator must document receipt of Sponsor approval and when 
applicable, document the site’s corrective ac tion plan to prevent future occurrences.  
When approaching the season appropriate for infl uenza vaccination, patients will be reminded to 
inform the clinic staff about vaccination plans. Similarly, when approaching the planned date of 
tetanus (alone or combined), any pneumococcal and any meningococcal vaccination, patients will be reminded about the related pre- and post-vacc ination blood sampling for vaccine IgG testing. 
Those who have not yet signed the separate cons ent for collection of blood pre-vaccination (eg, 
those who make mid-study decisions about vaccina tions) may do so just pr ior to blood collection.
It is recommended that assessments /procedures at a site visit are performed in the following order 
if applicable, and these assessments/procedures should be done prior to IMP administration: 
1. Patient-reported outcomes and other questionnaires 
2. Procedures: 
a) ECG

Source data is all information in or iginal records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_122567], observations, or other activities in a clin ical trial necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial. Source data are contai ned in source documents. Source documents are 
original documents, data and records such as hosp ital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, reco rded data from automated instruments, etc.
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be tran scribed directly from source documents.  Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central labora tories, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], nitric oxide measurement, 
ECG, and patient electronic diary / PEF meter will be considered source data.
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
The IMP should be continued whenever possible.  In case the IMP is stopped, it should be

The patients may withdraw from treatment with th e IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the r eason, or this may be the Investigator’s  decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the CRF or 
e-CRF.
Patients must be withdrawn from the treatmen t (ie, from any further investigational product 
administration) for the following reasons:  
xAt their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (Legally 
authorized representative means an individua l or judicial or othe r body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospe ctive patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research).

10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in  a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.
Protocol defined asthma exacerbation events are collected as efficacy endpoints via the “Asthma 
Exacerbation Events” form. These events should not be reported as AEs unless they fulfill a seriousness criterion.
For this study, asthma exacerbations should be managed by [CONTACT_181283] / international asthma management guidelines.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event
Aserious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical  occurrence that at any dose:
xResults in death, or 
xIs life-threatening, or  
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the defin ition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
xRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606], or 
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
xIs a medically important event
Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326868] (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the othe r outcomes listed in the definition above.

- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Anaphylaxis (refer to Appendix M for Definition of Anaphylaxis) 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agra nulocytosis, aplastic anem ia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], ep ileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse - ALT >[ADDRESS_406030] + total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_406031] or ALT increase > [ADDRESS_406032] 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality 
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling) 
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions - Cancers diagnosed during the study 
- Chronic neurodegenerative dis eases (newly diagnosed)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest
An adverse event of special intere st (AESI) is an AE (serious or  non-serious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s pr oduct or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by [CONTACT_328748]. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize a nd understand them. Advers e events of special 
interest may be added or removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be informed  immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described Section 10.4.4, even if not  fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding pages in the CRF (to be  sent) or screens in the e-CRF. 
xAnaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic re actions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (refer to Appendix M for Definition of Anaphylaxis) 
xSevere injection site reactions  that last longer than [ADDRESS_406033] one of the following criteria:
- Any serious infection (SAE) - Requires parenteral (intravenous, intramuscu lar, subcutaneous) antimicrobial therapy 
- Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 weeks

if it fulfills one of the seri ousness criteria (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female par ticipant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
xSymptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP/NIMP
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) w ith the IMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_328749] 11 days. The circumstances (ie, 
accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if 
any, entered on separate adverse event forms.
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) w ith any NIMP is an event suspected by [CONTACT_328750]. The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentiona l) should be clearly speci fied in the verbatim and 
symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms.

xThe Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last pla nned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_328751]. 
Patients who experience an ongoi ng SAE or an AESI with i mmediate notification, at the

notification.    
Infections defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] should be reported as  AESIs within 24 hours. 
A complete diagnostic work-up should be perf ormed (i.e., cultures, histopathological or 
cytological evaluation, antigen dete ction and serum antibody titers).  Patients should be referred to 
an infectious disease specialist if deemed ne cessary for diagnostic work up and appropriate 
treatment.
Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the infection is resolved.

No pre-clinical and clinical data has suggested any hepatic toxicity of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]; however, as a 
general consideration of clini cal development, the administration of immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulating agents may represent an ad ditional risk factor for hepatotoxicity.  
Hepatitis virus tests and liver function tests (LFT) will be performed at Visit 1, prior to 
randomization to exclude those patient s with high risk of hepatitis in fection or severe liver injury 
from this study (Refer to Section 7.2 and Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

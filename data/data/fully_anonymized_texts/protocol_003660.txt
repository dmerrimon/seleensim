Purpose,
 
Background
 
and
 
Rationale
 
 
2.1
 
Objective
 
The
 
overall
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
examine
 
the
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
of
 
easier
 
versus
 
harder
 
goals.
  
If
 
feasibility
 
and
 
acceptability
 
are
 
established,
 
efficacy
 
can
 
be
 
evaluated
 
in
 
a
 
subsequent,
 
fully-powered
 
optimization
 
trial.
 
The
 
overarching
 
research
 
question
 
of
 
this
 
line
 
of
 
work
 
is
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
optimal
 
goal
 
setting
 
intensities
 
that
 
maximize
 
weight
 
loss
 
in
 
a
 
digital
 
intervention
 
for
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight
 
or
 
obesity.

To

the

the

Aim

To
 
determine
 
the
 
acceptability
 
of

and
 
the
 
other

2.3
 
Background
 
and
 
Significance
 
2.3.1
 
Obesity
 
Obesity
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
public
 
health
 
problem.
 
Obesity
 
has
 
become
 
a
 
pervasive
 
health
 
concern
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
with
 
rates
 
of
 
42%
 
among
 
adults
 
and
 
another
 
30+%
 
overweight.
 
Excess
 
weight
 
heightens
 
risk
 
for
 
chronic
 
diseases,
 
including
 
type
 
[ADDRESS_329693]
 
for
 
treating
 
overweight
 
and
 
obesity.
 
These
 
5
 
 
traditional
 
treatments
 
are
 
effective
 
in
 
producing
 
weight
 
loss
 
up
 
to
 
10%,
 
but
 
often
 
lack
 
scalability.
 
This
 
research
 
is
 
significant
 
because
 
it
 
will
 
optimize
 
a
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
that
 
has
 
potential
 
for
 
broad
 
reach
 
and
 
scalability.
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_329694];
 
thus,
 
more
 
work
 
is
 
needed
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
fully
 
digital
 
approaches.
 
2.3.3
 
Goal
 
setting
 
Goal
 
setting
 
is
 
a
 
core
 
component
 
of
 
behavioral
 
obesity
 
treatment.
 
Goals
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
behaviors
 
(e.g.,
 
to
 
exercise
 
more)
 
or
 
outcomes
 
(e.g.,
 
to
 
lose
 
weight).
 
Many
 
behavioral
 
obesity
 
treatments
 
include
 
goals
 
for
 
weight
 
loss,
 
physical
 
activity,
 
and
 
calories,
 
yet
 
there
 
is
 
large
 
variability
 
in
 
the
 
specific
 
intensities
 
of
 
these
 
goals.
 
Past
 
research
 
has
 
shown
 
that
 
personalized
 
goals
 
are
 
helpful
 
at
 
promoting
 
behavior
 
change,
 
adaptive
 
goals
 
help
 
more
 
than
 
static
 
goals,
  
immediate
 
goals
 
help
 
more
 
than
 
gradual
 
goals,
 
and
 
larger
 
goals
 
help
 
more
 
than
 
smaller
 
goals,
 
However,
 
to
 
our
 
knowledge,
 
no
 
study
 
has
 
examined
 
the
 
optimal
 
goal
 
intensity
 
(i.e.,
 
harder
 
versus
 
easier
 
goals)
 
to
 
be
 
given
 
in
 
a
 
fully
 
digital
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention.
 
Doing
 
so
 
would
 
aid
 
in
 
identifying
 
the
 
most
 
efficacious
 
and
 
least
 
burdensome
 
approach
 
to
 
goal
 
setting
 
in
 
a
 
highly
 
scalable
 
context.

Theoretical
 
Framework
 
Self-regulation
 
theories,
 
including
 
Social
 
Cognitive
 
Theory
 
and
 
Control
 
Theory,
 
posit
 
that
 
behavior
 
change
 
occurs
 
through
 
comparison
 
of
 
one’s
 
behavior
 
to
 
one’s
 
goals
 
or
 
past
 
performance.
 
Meta-analyses
 
have
 
demonstrated
 
that
 
goal
 
setting,
 
self-monitoring,
 
and
 
feedback
 
work
 
in
 
tandem
 
to
 
promote
 
greater
 
behavior
 
change
 
and
 
weight
 
loss.

The
 
Multiphase

is
 
an
 
engineering-inspi[INVESTIGATOR_270430].
 
MOST
 
involves
 
three
 
phases:
 
Preparation,
 
Optimization,

Evaluation.
 
In
 
the

components

In
 
the
 
Optimization
 
phase,
 
the
 
unique
 
and
 
combined
 
effects
 
of
 
those
 
components
 
are
 
evaluated
 
in
 
a
 
fully-powered
 
trial.
 
Often,
 
a
 
factorial
 
design
 
is
 
used.
 
Components
 
and
 
component-levels
 
that
 
produce
 
a
 
minimal
 
clinically
 
important
 
difference
 
are
 
retained
 
in
 
the
 
newly
 
optimized
 
intervention,
 
whereas
 
those
 
that
 
produce
 
minimal
 
or
 
iatrogenic
 
effects
 
are
 
removed.
 
Lastly,
 
in
 
the
 
Evaluation
 
phase,
 
the
 
newly
 
optimized
 
intervention
 
is
 
tested
 
against
 
a

Randomization

Following

we
 
will
 
randomize
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
16
 
conditions
 
using
 
permuted
 
block
 
randomization
 
with
 
a
 
block
 
size
 
of
 
16.
 
The

allocation
 
sequence
 
will
 
be
 
generated
 
by
 
[CONTACT_41530]’s
 
PI
 
[INVESTIGATOR_270434].
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
use
 
REDCap
 
to
 
implement
 
the
 
random
 
allocation
 
sequence
 
(i.e.,
 
randomize
 
a
 
participant)
 
once
 
both
 
the
 
baseline
 
weight
 
and
 
web-based
 
surveys
 
are
 
submitted.
 
The
 
first
 
day
 
of
 
the
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
will
 
occur
 
approximately
 
two
 
days
 
after
 
randomization.
 
On
 
that
 
day,
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
automated
 
email
 
describing
 
their
 
treatment
 
assignment.
 
Participants
 
will

Study
 
staff
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
masked
 
to
 
treatment
 
assignment
 
due
 
to
 
logistical
 
limitations
 
and
 
the
 
need
 
for

However,
 
all
 
surveys
 
will
 
be

that

a
 
behavioral
 
weight

intervention
 
that
 
is
 
of

intensity
 
and
 
remotely

Risks
 
to
 
participants
 
are
 
anticipated
 
to
 
be
 
low
 
given
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
examining
 
evidence-based
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
and
 
promoting
 
weight
 
loss
 
through
 
lifestyle
 
change
 
(e.g.,
 
decrease
 
intake
 
of
 
unhealthy
 
foods,
 
increase
 
steps).
 
We

not
 
be

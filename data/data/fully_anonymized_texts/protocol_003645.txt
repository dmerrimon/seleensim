dropout is around 20% with this dropout frequency staying relatively stable over the past [ADDRESS_968966] been a number of dramatic soft CL innovations 
during this time frame (e.g., widely available daily disposable CL s, silicone hydrogel CL materials with high 
oxygen transmissibility , new CL surface coatings ).[ADDRESS_968967] insights into the full day CL  wearing experience over one month .  
 
II. SPECIFIC AIM  
 We plan to accomplish our goal s by [CONTACT_155281]: 
 
Aim 1: Determine if Total30 Sphere  CLs provide a comfortable wearing experience all day. 
Hypothesis  1: Patients who are refit in Total30 Sphere CLs will have a comfortable wearing experience 
after 16 hours as based on visual analog scale ( VAS) scores.  
 
III. STUDY DESIGN  
 
Subjects  
 This one- month , three -visit study will be conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, 
AL, [LOCATION_003]). Subjects will be recruited via clinic records, email, and fliers.  Subjects will be screened prior to the 
study visit with an IRB approved phone screening survey. Adult , 18- to 45- year-old, CL wearers who have 
20/20 visual acuity or better and who are minimally symptomatic will be recruited (Contact [CONTACT_506779] [CLDEQ] -8 ≤10).
3, [ADDRESS_968968] 6 months and be a current CL 
wearer . Subjects will be required to provide a glasses prescription that is less than 3 years old. Subjects will be 
required to be willing to start wearing their CLs between 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM and wear their CLs until 11:[ADDRESS_968969] research (40 subjects + 8 subjects to account for attrition and missing data) .
8-10 An additional 10 
subjects are being requested to account for screen fails; however, recruitment will stop when 48 subjects fully 
qualify for this study  (max of 58 subjects) .  
Version 6 
 
Surveys and Clinical Tests  
 
Visit 1 : Baseline  
 
1. Subject History, Eligibility, Informed Consent:  Subjects will be asked to repeat the IRB approved phone 
screening survey at the study visit to verify that they are still eligible for the study.  All subjects  will be screened 
with the  CLDEQ -[ADDRESS_968970] two weeks to verify that they are 
asymptomatic CL wearers . While subjects will be asked to report to the visit without their CLs , they will be  asked 
to complete the CLDEQ -8 as if they are wearing their habitual CLs.  All relevant patient demographics will be 
collected via a questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_473]. Non- eligible subjects will be dismissed at this time 
or rescheduled depending upon the reason for ineligibility. Eligible subjects will be enrolled, consented, and requested to sign a privacy document .  
 
2. Visual Acuity  with Spectacles : Visual acuity will be measured with a Bailey -Lovie high- contrast chart.  
 
3. Manifest Refraction:  The investigator will determine the subject’s refractive error with a phoropter, and 
binocular balance will be performed if best -corrected visual acuity is equal in between eyes.  
 
4. Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy: The investigator will use a slit -lamp biomicroscope to document normal and/or 
remarkable findings of the anterior eye structures: eyelashes (blepharitis), eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  
 
5. CL Fitting:  Subject will be fit in Total30 Sphere CLs. The CLs will be evaluated for centration, movement, 
coverage, and CL power adjustments will only be made if they improve Snellen visual acuity. Subjects will be 
given a 1- month supply of CLEAR CARE® CL solution. Subjects will be educated on how to use CLEAR CARE® . 
 
6. Subject Compliance & Daily Comfort:  All subjects will be encouraged to wear their CLs for at least 16 hours 
per day  and to start wearing their CLs between 6:00 AM and 8:[ADDRESS_968971] study visit to mak e sure that 
they system is compatible with their phone. These surveys will ask s ubjects about their eye comfort with a visual 
analog scale (slider scale with 0 as neutral comfort, - 50 extremely uncomfortable, and +50 extremely 
comfortable ) at before CL application, directly after CL application,  and at [ADDRESS_968972] 5 day s. This same system will be used to monitor how many hours 
they wear their CLs each day. Subjects will finally  be asked to complete these surveys on day 14 and 1 day prior 
to their 1- month visit  (1 month) to understand comfort over the life of the CLs . Subjec ts will be called the day 
before the day 14 and 1- month surveys to remind them about these surveys.  Subjects will be allowed to schedule 
their day 14 and 1- month surveys within 3 days of these time points to allow for better compliance.   
 Visit 2: 1 Week  
 
1. Visual Acuity with CLs:  Visual acuity will be measured with a Bailey -Lovie high- contrast chart.  
 
2. Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy:  The investigator will use a slit -lamp biomicroscope to document normal and/or 
remarkable findings of the anterior eye structures: eyelashes (blepharitis), eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  
 
3. CL Evaluation:  The CLs will be evaluated for centration, movement, and coverage, and lens power 
adjustments will only be made if they improve Snellen visual acuity. If a refractive er ror adjustment of more than 
0.25 D is made, the patient will be given a new set of lenses and be required to repeat the 1 -week visit.  
 
Visit 3: 1 Month  
 
1. Visual Acuity with CLs:  Visual acuity will be measured with a Bailey -Lovie high- contrast chart.  
 
2. Slit -Lamp Biomicroscopy:  The investigator will use a slit -lamp biomicroscope to document normal and/or 
remarkable findings of the anterior eye structures: eyelashes (blepharitis),  eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea.  
Version 6 
 
3. CL Evaluation:  The CLs will be evaluated for centration, movement, and coverage, and lens power 
adjustments will only be made if they improve Snellen visual acuity. If interested, the patient will be given a 
prescription for the CLs upon request.  
 
4. Study Completion:  The subject will be compensated for their time, and they will be released from the study.  
 Data Analysis  
 All data will be analyzed with Stata/IC 15 (StataCorp LLC ; TX, [LOCATION_003]). VAS comfort scores will serve as the 
primary endpoint and be reported as percent of patients who are comfortable at each timepoint. C omfort 
comparisons across visits or across the wear day  will serve as exploratory endpoints, and these outcomes will 
be measured with paired t -tests or ANOVA .  
 Training of Study Personnel  
 
Prior to enrolling any subjects all examiners will par ticipate in a training session developed by [INVESTIGATOR_154159] D. Pucker, 
OD, PhD. This full investigator meeting will ensure that all study investigators are performing the procedures in 
the same manner. Data from each investigator’s first subject will also be monitored for quality control by [CONTACT_10748]’s coordinator before the investigator is allowed to see additional subjects.  
 
IV. Study Timeline  
 
  [ADDRESS_968973] describing comfort across the wear day will be submitted  to Academy 2022 San Diego (main 
outcome) , and an abstract will be submitted to Heart of America Eye Congress describing how comfort 
changes over the wear month. A  manuscript  on the same topic s will be submitted to Contact [CONTACT_19550] & Anterior 
Eye after the Academy [ADDRESS_968974] not been presented/submitted elsewhere.    
VI. Conclusions  
 This project will be among the first to describe the progression of CL comfort throughout the day for Total30 
Sphere CLs. These data are important because they could provide insight into end of day CL discomfort, and 
they will provide data needed for proper patient education.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 15 of 110 Template 18.01 INTRODUCTION
Study D9108C00002 (NeoCOAST) is a platform study assessing the efficacy and safety of 
neoadjuvant durvalumab alone or in combination with novel agents in subjects withresectable, early-stage (Stage I [> 2 cm] to IIIA) non-small cell l ung cancer (NSCLC). New 
combination treatment arms can be added duri ng the course of the study via a protocol 
amendment, as novel agents of interest become available for testing in this population of 
patients (Section 1.6.3 ).
1.[ADDRESS_971844] common cancer in both men and women, with an estimated 
234,030 new cases of lung cancer in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in 2018, and remains the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. NSCLC represents approximately 85% of all lung cancers, and 30% of patients present with resectable NSCLC at diagnosis ( American Cancer 
Society, 2018 ). Resectable, early-stage NSCLC is considered a potentially curable disease, 
and the standard of care is surgery alone or surgery with adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
platinum-based doublet chemotherapy ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2018 ). 
However, up to 55% of patients eventually relapse after surgery and die from NSCLC (Uramoto and Tanaka, 2014 ). 
Based on the National Cancer Data Base dataset, patients had 5-year survival rates ranging 
from approximately 70% for Stage IA1 NSCLC to 20% for Stage IIIA NSCLC ( Chansky et 
al, 2017 ). The use of adjuvant chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen has been shown 
to provide survival benefit in patients with resected, early-stage NSCLC; a quantitative meta-analysis of multiple clinical trials evaluati ng adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a 4% 
to 5% improvement in overall survival (OS) with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy following 
surgery compared to surgery alone ( Burdett et al, 2015 ). In addition, preoperative neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy has also been studied in several trials in patients with resectable NSCLC (Burdett et al, 2006 ). A meta-analysis of 7 trials showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
improved OS versus surgery alone (5-year OS rate of 20% vs 14%, respectively). Furthermore, the use of a neoadjuvant approach offers the possibility for assessing clinical and molecular biomarkers that may correlate with se nsitivity to therapy and possibly, long-term 
outcomes. 
Compared with adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC, the use of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy resulted in a higher proportion of patients receiving the planned chemotherapy 
regimen, which supports the notion that early-stage NSCLC patients have a more favorable clinical condition before compared to after a major surgical lung resection ( Felip et al, 2010 ). 
In addition, patients with resectable NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy have higher rates of pathol ogical tumor res ponse (complete response and/or ≤10% residual viable 
tumor cells) within the resected specimen compared to patients who underwent surgery alone,

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_971845] clinical benefit and correl ates with improved outcomes ( Cascone et al, 
2018 ; Felip et al, 2010 ; Machtay et al, 2004 ; Pataer et al, 2012 ). In other tumor types, such as 
early-stage breast cancer, pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlates with OS, and is consid ered a valid and widely used endpoint in 
clinical studies ( Bear et al, 2006 ; Rastogi et al, 2008 ).
In the subset of patients with Stage IIIA and N2 disease, the role of surgery remains 
controversial. In general, for unselected patients with Stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC, both chemotherapy alone or in combination with ra diation followed by [CONTACT_713700], but neither showed an OS benefit with the use of surgery ( Albain et al, 2009 ; Eberhardt et al, 2015 ; van Meerbeeck et al, 2007 ).
However, a critical appraisal of these studies demonstrates that the Stage IIIA-N2 population 
is heterogeneous and a subset of patients such as those requiring only a lobectomy/bilobectomy instead of a total pneumonectomy, or those with a single lymph node 
(N2 single station) smaller than 3 cm can be considered candidates for surgery ( Decaluwé et 
al, 2009 ; Martins et al, 2012 ; Pless et al, 2015 ; van Meerbeeck et al, 2007 ). Furthermore, it is 
recommended that Stage IIIA-N2 (single nodal station, ≤3 cm in size) disease be rigorously 
confirmed (ie, both radiologically and invasively) and the presence of N3 disease be clearlyexcluded ( Vansteenkiste et al, 2010 ).
Recently, the role of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 
(PD-L1) inhibition has been evaluated for the treatment of resectable, early-stage NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting. In a single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], a total of 21 subjects with resectable, 
early-stage NSCLC received one month of neoadjuvant treatment with nivolumab 
(OPDIVO®). After 1 month of treatment with neoadjuvant nivolumab, radiologic responseswere observed in 2 (9.5%) subjects, and major pathological responses (MPRs) were observed in 45% of the resected tumors ( Forde et al, 2018 ). In another small Phase 2, single-arm study 
evaluating neoadjuvant atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) alone, MPRs were observed in 10 of 50 (20%) subjects, including 3 subjects who had pCRs in the primary tumor. Three subjects had partial responses (PRs) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1; Rusch et al, 2018 ). Overall, both studies concluded that neoadjuvant 
nivolumab and atezolizumab were safe and did not delay the planned surgical resection. These 
studies also demonstrated the potential for using pathologic changes within the tumor as an 
objective measure of antitumor activity.
Overall, early-stage NSCLC, despi[INVESTIGATOR_713681], has a high risk of relapse and 
death due to disease progression. Thus, new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713682]-term prognosis for patients with  resectable, early-stage NSCLC.

[IP_ADDRESS] Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1
PD-1, PD-L1, and programmed cell death ligand-2 (PD-L2) are part of a complex system of 
receptors and ligands that control T-cell activation. PD-L1 expression helps tumors evade 
detection and elimination by [CONTACT_27639] ( Chen and Mellman, 2013 ; Juneja et al, 
2017 ; Keir et al, 2008 ; Ohaegbulam et al, 2015 ). The binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 on activated 
T cells delivers an inhibitory signal preve nting T cells from killing target tumor cells ( Pardoll, 
2012 ; Zou and Chen, 2008 ; Zou et al, 2016 ). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting PD-1 
(nivolumab, pembrolizumab [KEYTRUDA®]) and PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab) have shown evidence of antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with NSCLC and have been granted approvals by [CONTACT_713701]/or the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of NSCLC ( IMFINZI® US Package Insert [PI], 
2018 ; KEYTRUDA US PI, 2018 ; OPDIVO US PI, 2018 ; TECENTRIQ US PI, 2018 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] CD73
Adenosine is a regulatory autocrine and paracrine factor that accumulates in the tumor 
microenvironment, influencing immune activity, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Upon apoptotic 
or necrotic cell death, tumor cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the extracellular space. ATP has been shown to lead to a pro-inflammatory response. To prevent an immune overactivation, tissues express cluster of differentiation (CD)39 and CD73 to en zymatically 
convert ATP to adenosine, which induces a localized immunosuppressive response through multiple immune cell types. In the extracellular  space, CD39 and CD 73 in tan dem metab olize 
ATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and AMP to adenosine, respectively, and are a 
major source of extracellular adenosine. Extracellular adenosine impairs the proliferation and 
effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes while simultaneously contributing to the immunosuppressive effects of both regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, 
among others ( Vijayan et al, 2017 ). The rate limiting step in the generation of extracellular 
adenosine is the dephosphorylation of AMP by [CONTACT_398]73. 
One mechanism by [CONTACT_713702]73. Overexpression of CD73 has been associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types ( Inoue et al, 2017 ; Turcotte et al, 2015 ; Vijayan et al, 2017 ). Notably, 
high CD73 expression in NSCLC was associated with poor OS and recurrence free survival in 
a multivariate analysis ( Inoue et al, 2017 ). It is hypothesized that blocking CD73 activity will 
reduce adenosine production, thus augmenting host and/or immunotherapy response to tumor.
[IP_ADDRESS] NKG2a
Major histocompatibility co mplex E (HLA-E) is a non-classical major histocompatib ility 
complex class I molecule, over-expressed by [CONTACT_713703] a variety of tumor types. 
HLA-E can present antigens to the CD94/NKG2a receptors on the surface of some types of lymphocytes. Activation of CD94/NKG2a receptors induces inhibitory signals that suppress

cells against stressed, infected, or “transformed” cells. Such activity has been described as a possible mechanism in immune escape of cancer cells ( Borrego et al, 1998 ; Braud et al, 1998 ). 
Conversely, the blockade of CD94/NKG2a by [CONTACT_713704], enhancing notably their cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing HLA-E. 
Furthermore, blockade of CD94/NKG2a may enhance NK-mediated antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity ( Denis et al, 2017 ). NK cells can also decrease metastasis through 
immunosurveillance ( López-Soto et al, 2017 ; Malladi et al, 2016 )
Expression of CD94/NKG2a has been documented by [CONTACT_713705] T lymphocytes and 
NK cells infiltrating solid tumors. CD94/NKG2a appeared to be over-expressed in tumor-infiltrating NK cells as compared to NK cells present in the non-tumoral areas of the same tissue or in the blood. Hyper-expression of CD94/NKG2a by [CONTACT_713706] ( Mamessier et al, 2011 ; 
Platonova et al, 2011 ; Sheu et al, 2005 ) and has been documented in a variety of solid tumors
including NSCLC, colorectal, ovarian, endometrial, pancreatic, and prostate cancers(Aparicio-Pages et al, 1991 ; Gooden et al, 2011 ; Iannone et al, 2015 ; Pasero et al, 2015 ; Peng 
et al, 2014 ; Tarle et al, 1993 ; Zeestraten et al, 2014 ). In addition, expression of HLA-E has 
been shown to correlate with a poor outcome in colorectal, ovarian, or endometrial carcinoma(Emens et al, 2017 ; Gooden et al, 2011 ; Guo et al, 2015 ; Versluis et al, 2017 ).
[IP_ADDRESS] STAT3
Interactions between tumor cells, immune cells and other cell types within the tumor 
microenvironment have a significant impact on the progression of cancer. Inflammatory cells, 
fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the microenvironment release cytokines, chemokines and 
growth factors to stimulate tumor growth and to modulate the invasive potential of tumor cells. These signals al so create immunosuppressive networks that enable immune evasion of 
tumor cells ( Yu et al, 2007 ). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) drives 
the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor from tumor cells, and also regulates the production of pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic cytokines, as well as immune suppressive signaling in immune cells. Thus, STAT3 establishes a critical crosstalk between tumor cells and tumor-asso ciated immune cells and is a central component 
of a ‘feed-forward loop’ that shifts the tumor microenvironment to a more pro-tumorigenic 
phenotype ( Kortylewski et al, 2009 ; Yu et al, 2007 ).

activation. Refer to the current durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for details. 
1.2.2 Oleclumab
Oleclumab (MEDI9447) is a human IgG1 lambda mAb that selectively binds to CD73, and leads to a reduction in CD73 expression through internalization, thus contributing to decreased adenosine production ( Geoghegan et al, 2016 ; Hay et al, 2016 ). It contains a triple mutation in 
the heavy chain constant region for reduced effector function. The enzymatic blockade of CD73 and decreased expression caused by [CONTACT_713707]73 may lead to increased antitumor immunity. Refer to the current oleclumab IB for details. 
1.2.3 Monalizumab
Monalizumab (IPH2201) is a humanized mAb of the IgG-[ADDRESS_971847] the CD94/NKG2a subunit of the heterodimeric inhibitory CD94/NKG2a receptor expressed by [CONTACT_33111], activated αβ CD8+ T cells and 
γδ-T cells. By [CONTACT_33112]94/NKG2a, monalizumab

1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
Five-year survival rates in early-stage NSC LC ranges from approximately  70% for S tage IA1 
disease to 20% for Stage IIIA disease, with the majority of patients experiencing post-surgical 
relapse and disease recurrence ( Chansky et al, 2017 ; Goldstraw et al, 2007 ). Adjuvant 
platinum-based chemotherapy provides an approximate 5% increase in survival benefit compared to surgery alone, with rates of overall Grade 3 to 4 toxicity of 66%. Thus, there is 
an unmet medical need for more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713683]-stage NSCLC. 
Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in the neoadjuvant setting may provide clinical benefit by [CONTACT_713709], and eradicating micrometastas es prior to surgery, 
thereby [CONTACT_713710]. Two recent clinical studies have shown that blockade of PD-l/PD-L1 in the neoadjuvant setting may yield clinically meaningful pathological response 
(MPR and pCR) in subjects with resectable, early-stage NSCLC without delaying planned surgical resection ( Forde et al, 2018 ;Rusch et al, 2018 ). 
In the NeoCOAST study, utilizing a neoadjuvant approach to assess the role of durvalumab 
alone or in combination with novel agents has several advantages. First, durvalumab alone or 
in combination with novel agents may result  in pathological response and/or downstaging 
prior to surgery. Second, the resected tumors can be analyzed and provides a unique opportunity to pe rform correlative biomarker studies a nd investigate changes in the tumor 
microenvironment. Predictive biomarkers or underlying resistance mechanisms may be identified, which will help inform future durvalumab-based combination therapy studies. Additionally, nonclinical evidence supports that immune response to neoadjuvant immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_713684], which may 
enhance the antitumor immune response  ( Liu et al, 2016 ). Further, in order to maximize the 
benefit-risk assessment, the treatment period duration will be short, which will minimize treatment exposure, potential AEs, and avoid delaying the planned surgical tumor resection.
The NeoCOAST study will utilize a platform st udy design, which will allow for the rapid 
evaluation of neoadjuvant durvalumab alone or in combination with novel agents in patients with resectable, early-stage (Stage I [> 2 cm] to IIIA) NSCLC. Combining a platform study design with early efficacy endpoints (eg, MPR) will provide a more dynamic approach to

Neoadjuvant durvalumab and novel oncology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 18Jan2019; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_971848] a known mechanism of action
that could be additive or synergistic with durvalumab, an established recommended dose in 
combination with durvalumab with an acceptable safety profile, and preliminary evidence of 
clinical activity in combination with durvalumab in a solid tumor setting. As a starting point, oleclumab, monalizumab, and danvatirsen meet these criteria, and will be used in combination with durvalumab as the init ial combin ation arms of this platform study.
1.5.1 Rationale for Inclusion of Durvalumab in Combination with Oleclumab
High CD73 expression in NSCLC is associated with poor OS and recurrence free survival in a 
multivariate analysis ( Inoue et al, 2017 ). CD73 is known to contribute to the 
immunosuppressive effects of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, among others ( Vijayan et al, 2017 ). Nonclinical experiments have shown increased 
tumor growth inhibition and survival in tumor bearing mice treated with anti-CD73 antibody in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies ( Hay et al, 2016 ). As oleclumab selectively 
binds to CD73 and inhibits adenosine production as well as leads to a reduction in CD73 expression, the combination with durvalumab is  hypothesized to have a synergistic effect on 
reversal of immune suppression in the tumor mi croenvironment. Oleclumab in combination 
with durvalumab had a manageable safety profile in Study D6070C00001 (see Section 1.4.2 ),
further supporting exploration of this treatment combination.

which have been shown to be associated with improved survival ( Felip et al, 2010 ; Machtay et
al, 2004 ; Pataer et al, 2012 ).
This protocol will allow subjects with resec table, early-stage (Stage I [> 2 cm] to IIIA) 
NSCLC to receive durvalumab alone or in combination with novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and potentially achieve pathological response. Selection of the combination novel agents was based on nonclinical and clinical data supporting a potentially favorable interaction with durvalumab in this patient population, with a well-tol erated and manageable safety profile.

Overall, oleclumab and durvalumab combination therapy has demonstrated an acceptable 
safety profile (Section 1.4.2 ).  
 
For oleclumab, important potential risks include arterial calcifications, arterial ischemic

joint calcifications.  
 
Other important potential risks associated with the administration of mAbs include IRRs, 
anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or serious allergic reactions, and immune complex disease. Additional potential risks associated with any IV administration are localized infection, redness, swelling, pain, and induration at the administration site. Given the mode of action of oleclumab, the theoretical risk associated with removing the inhibition of adenosine on the microenvironment favors increased antitumor immunity when combined with durvalumab, as well as the risk of emergence of autoimmune phenomena.

theoretical risks that could be related to its ad ministration. These risks include adverse effects 
on the immune system, such as emergence of autoimmune phenomena, increased risk of infection, acute generalized or delayed hypersensitivity reactions, immunogenicity, local injection-site r eactions and AEs associated with th e blocking effect on CD94/NKG2a

For danvatirsen, important identified risks are thrombocytopenia and liver enzyme elevations

3.1.1 Overview
Study D9108C00002 (NeoCOAST) is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, randomized, 
multidrug platform study of durvalu mab alone or in combination with novel agents in subjects 
with resectable, early-stage (Stage I [> 2 cm] to IIIA) NSCLC.
Subjects will be enrolled and randomized into the durvalumab alone or combination treatment 
arms. Information on subject randomization and sample size is provided in Section 4.6.1 and 
Section 4.8.2 , respectively. Up to approximately 25 sites globally will participate in this study.
Treatment arms may be opened sequentially or in parallel. Subjects will be treated with 
durvalumab alone or in combination with novel agents for up to 28 days, followed by [CONTACT_78043]. After surgical resection, sub jects will be followed up to Day 105 ( Figure 1 ). New 
durvalumab combination therapy arms may be added based on emerging nonclinical and 
clinical data via a protocol amendment (Section 1.6.3 ). Interim futility analyses will be 
performed using Bayesian pre dictive probabilities (Section 4.8.7 ).

4.1.[ADDRESS_971869] Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identif ication (SID) number will be 
assigned by a central system (eg, an interactive voice/web response system [IXRS]), and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study  eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The 
SID number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation, if applicable. 
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria and 
are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not be 
randomized or receive study treatment. Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for 
participation in this study (screen failure) may  be re-screened, only after discussion with and 
permission from the sponsor or its designee. Further details regarding rando mization are 
detailed in Section 4.6.1 .
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects are free to withdraw their consent to participate in the study (study treatment and 
assessments) at any time, without prejudice to  further treatment. All study drug(s) should be 
returned by [CONTACT_423]. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further study visits or d ata coll ection should take p lace.

disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. If samples are already analyzed, 
MedImmune is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. As collection of the 
biological samples is an integral part of the st udy, if a subject decides to withdraw consent to 
the use of donated biological samples, then the subject will also be withdrawn from further 
study participation.
The Principal Investigator:
!Ensures subject’s withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to MedImmune.
!Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented.
!Ensures the organization(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed, the action documented 
and the signed document returned to the study site.
!Ensures that the subject and MedImmune are informed about the sample disposal.
MedImmune ensures the organizations holding the samples is/are informed about the 
withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed and the action documented and returned to the study site.

4.3.1 Eff icacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Response
Pathological tumor response will be assessed locally in the resected specimens. Hematoxylin 
and eosin-stained slides of sections of the gross residual tumor will be prepared by 
[CONTACT_152456]. At least [ADDRESS_971881] imated by [CONTACT_713714]-sectional 
area of the viable tumor cells with  estimated cross-sectional total tumor (including areas of
necrosis, fibrosis, and/or inflammation). The resu lts from all slides will be averaged together 
to determine the mean values for each subject. MPR is defined by ≤10% viable tumor cells in 
the resected specimen. pCR is defined as no residual viable tumor cells in the resected specimen. At the discretion of the sponsor, an independent, central review may be considered to evaluate pathological response. 
RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix F ) will be used to assess subject response to treatment and allow 
calculation of ORR. Disease assessments will be performed according to the schedules in Section 4.2. Radiographical confirmation of a response is not feasible due to the length of the 
study (eg, a confirmatory scan will not be performed). Tumor assessments may include the following evaluations: cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest, abdomen, and brain. 
!MRI (preferred) or CT scans of the brain will be performed at screening for all subjects
!CT or MRI scan of the chest and abdomen will be performed at screening and with each 
disease assessment for all subjects. 
The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast; if CT with contrast is 
contraindicated, CT without contrast is preferred over MRI. The preferred method for central 
nervous system imaging is MRI; if CT scan is performed, CT with contrast is required. The same method is preferre d for all subsequent tumor assessments. 
Computed Tomography Scan
!CT (contrast preferred) scans of the chest and abdomen should be performed with 
contiguous cuts in slice thickness of [ADDRESS_971882] should be performed using a 
5-mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. The same imaging device should be used for 
serial evaluations.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan
!MRI scan of the chest and abdomen is acceptable for measurement of lesions provided 
that the same anatomical plane is used for serial assessments.

4.3.2 Lung Cancer Surgery
Feasibility to surgery will be evaluated (Section 4.8.4 ). General recommendations for the 
surgical therapy of subjects with resectable NSCLC include, where feasible:
!Anatomical resection consisting of at least a lobectomy
!Adequate collection of the margins of resection 
!N1 and N2 node resection and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_713688] a minimum of three N2 
stations sampled or preferentially a complete mediastinal lymph node resection
!Complete ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection is highly recommended for 
subjects undergoing resection for Stage IIIA-N2 disease
!A complete resection is the most important prognostic factor and should include free 
resection margins including mediastinal lymph node dissection
!Subjects who are eligible for an anatomic segmentectomy with formal ligation of the 
segmental artery and bronchus, and node dissection as described above can be considered after discussion with the medical monitor

4.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Evaluation and Methods
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate PK in plasma or serum when durvalumab is 
administered alone and/or in combination with novel agents. Additionally, PK of novel agents administered in combination with durvalumab will be evaluated; see Section 4.2for collection 
time points. Evaluations will be performed using a validated immunoassay.
In combination arms, at visits when predose and end of infusion samples are required, PK 
predose (within 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion) and end of infusion (within [ADDRESS_971887] end of infusion) samples will be collected according to the administration time of each study drug. For example: PK predose Agent 1 collected →Agent 1 administration → PK 
end of infusion Agent 1 collected → PK predose Agent 2 collected →Agent 2 administration 
→ PK end of infusion Agent 2 collected.
4.3.6 Immunogenicity Evaluation and Methods
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate antidrug antibody (ADA) responses to biological 
agents (durvalumab, oleclumab, monalizumab, and danvatirsen) when durvalumab is administered alone or in combinat ion with novel agents; see Section 4.2for collection time 
points. Evaluations will be performed using a validated immunoassay. Tiered analyses will be performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay components, and the positive-
negative cut points will be statistically determined from drug-naive validation samples. 
Samples may be utilized for further characterization of the ADA response.
In all tr eatment arms, ADA samples will be collected within [ADDRESS_971888] study drug only. For example: ADA predose Agent 1 and Agent 2 collected → Agent 1 administration → Agent 2 administration.

The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurren ce. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being e nrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment should be recorded as an AE or SAE.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE that:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject
!Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
5.[ADDRESS_971917](s) and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_713725]. An AESI may be serious or nonserious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this investigational product(s).
5.3.[ADDRESS_971918] for Durvalumab-containing 
Regimens
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or

Neoadjuvant durvalumab and novel oncology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 18Jan2019; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73 of 110 Template 18.0interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants, and/or hormone replacement therapy. 
These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy 
and combination therapy. An immune-mediated adverse event (imAE) is defined as an AE that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and 
histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shoul d be used to support an imAE diagnosis. 
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the imAE.
If the investigator has any questions determining whether an AE is an imAE, the investigator 
should promptly contact [CONTACT_713726]. AESIs observe d with durvalumab include:
!Diarrhea/colitis and intestinal perforations
!Pneumonitis
!Hepatitis
!Endocrinopathies (ie, events of hypophysitis/ hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
adrenal insufficiency, and hyper- and hypothyroidism)
!Rash/dermatitis
!Nephritis
!Pancreatitis
!Myocarditis
!Myositis/polymyositis
!Neuropathy/neuromuscular toxicity (eg, Guillain-Barré and myasthenia gravis)
!Immune complex disease. The immune system can respond to foreign mAbs by 
[CONTACT_33140]-anti-human antibodies, which may result in formation of immune complexes and their deposition in blood vessels, joints, and glomeruli causing 
symptomatic disease (eg, vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, arthritis, serum sickness). 
Subjects who experience an AE suspected to be immune-complex related and with 
confirmed presence of ADAs will discontinue treatment. Immune-complex disease will 
be managed in accordance with standard of care.
!Other inflammatory responses that are rare/less frequent with a potential immune-
mediated etiology include, but are not limited to, pericarditis, sarcoidosis, uveitis and 
other events involving the eye, skin, hematological and rheumatological events.
In addition, IRRs and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a different underlying 
pharmacological etiology are also considered  AESIs. Infusion of biological products is 
commonly associated with IRRs. Anaphylaxis and IRRs have some common manifestations 
and may be difficult to distinguish from each  other. IRRs are commonly observed during or 
shortly after the first time of exposure to therapeutic mAbs delivered through IV infusion. These reactions are less common following subs equent exposures. Unlike IRRs, anaphylaxis 
is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent exposure to an antigen, and it is most

is advised to carefully examine symptoms of adverse reactions observed during or shortly after exposure to investigational product, and consider the above-mentioned facts prior to 
making a final diagnosis. For the investigator’s convenience and to facilitate consistency in judgments, a copy of the National Institute of  Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and 
Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) guidance for anaphylaxis diagnosis is 
provided in Appendix C .
Further information on these risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab IB. More specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in the Toxicity Management Guidelines (Section 3.1.3 ). These guidelines 
have been prepared by [CONTACT_713728] e investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical

and thrombosis. Because of this potential risk, potential subjects with a history of myocardial 
infarction or or any other arterial thrombotic even t within 6 months before  study entry are not 
eligible (see Section 4.1.3 ). These events require urgent medical management, which should 
be performed according to consensus guidelines developed by [CONTACT_713729].
Edema
Edema (eg, pulmonary or peripheral) is regarded as an AESI due to oleclumab potential risks 
of increased microvascular permeability. For subjects who develop ≥ Grade 2 pulmonary 
edema or ≥Grade 3 peripheral edema after treatment with durvalumab plus oleclumab, doses 
should be omi tted (S ection 3.1.3 ), and therapy may be discontinued at the discretion of the

regarding the co-involvement of disease progression, if appropriate, and should assign 
main and contributory causes of death.
•Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem (autopsy) may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy

progression should not be reported as an SAE (see reporting guidelines in Section 5.4.3 ).
The term disease progression should not be reported as an AE or SAE, however, medically 
significant individual events and/or laboratory abnorm alities associ ated with disease 
progression (see definition of disease progression a bove) that fulfill the AE or SAE definition 
should be reported.
New Cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the investigational product(s) and have been identified after the subject’s inclusion in the study. New metastatic lesion(s) of the 
subject’s known cancer should not be reported as a new cancer.

If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel must
inform the appropriate sponsor re presentative(s) within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later 
than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated study representative works with  the investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the sponsor’s patient safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days 
of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform sponsor representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system, an automated email aler t is sent to inform the designated sponsor 
representative(s).
If the EDC system is not available, then the i nvestigator or other study site personnel reports 
an SAE to the appropriate sponsor representative by [CONTACT_756]. The sponsor representative will advise the investigator/study site personnel how to proceed.

administration in doses significantly exceeding those specified in the protocol (> 10% of 
recommended dose) is considered an overdose; overdose in an amount ≤10% of the specified 
dose and not associated with AEs does not need to be reported.
!An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF  and on the Overdose eCRF module.
!An overdose without associated AEs is onl y reported on the Overdose eCRF module.
If an overdose on any investigational product occurs  during the course of the study, then the 
investigator or other site personnel s hould i nform appropriate sponsor representatives 
immediately, but no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s patient safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply; see Section 5.5. 
For other overdoses (ie, those not associated with  an AE or SAE), reporting must occur within

If a subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, investigational product should be 
discontinued immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_713692] a contraceptive medication. 
Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth or congenital abnormality) should be  followed up and documented even if the 
subject was discontinued from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95 of 110 Template 18.09.2 Protocol Amendment 1
Text revisions resulting from this amendment are incorporated in the body of Protocol 
Amendment 1. The principal reason for this ame ndment is to address feedback provided by
[CONTACT_3133] (FDA) after the Investigational New Drug filing. 
Substantial changes to the protocol are summarized below.
1 Section 3.1.3 (Management of Study Medication Related Toxicities): Specified that for 
subjects who develop ≥ Grade 2 pulmonary edema or ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_971947].
2 Table 5 (Schedule of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Period Procedures): 
(a) Added ECG assessments predose and immediately after the end of danvatirsen 
infusion on Week 0, Day [ADDRESS_971948]. 
(b) Added PK assessments on Week 3, Day [ADDRESS_971949]. 
3 Section 4.8.4 (Safety): Clarified that the SRC will assess feasibility to surgery for all 
treatment arms during every meeting and added safety measures in the event that more than [ADDRESS_971950] per treatment arm experiences a delay in receiving the planned surgery 
(outside of the prespecified exclusionary reasons) to address an FDA request. 
4 Section 5.3.2 (Adverse Events of Special Interest Associated with Oleclumab): Revised to 
state that for subjects who develop ≥ Grade 2 pulmonary edema or ≥ Grade 3 peripheral 
edema (previously ≥ Grade 3 edema) after treatment with durvalumab and oleclumab, 
doses should be omitted, and therapy may be discontinued at the discretion of the 
investigator per FDA request.
Changes to the protocol considered to be non-substantial are summarized below: 
1 Figure 1 (Study Flow Diagram): Removed Ar m E and Arm F from the study design figure 
per FDA request. 
2 Table 5 (Schedule of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Period Procedures): 
(a) Footnote a: Added a dosing window of ± 3 days on Week 2, Day 1 and Week 4, 
Day 1 of danvatirsen administration to provide greater scheduling flexibility for the 
subjects.  
(b) Footnote n: Removed text on the timing of performing a brain MRI or CT scan, “This 
must be performed only after study eligibility is confirmed, to detect intracranial 
metastasis” to correct an error, as subjects with brain metastasis have late-stage 
NSCLC and would not be eligible to participate in this study. 
(c) Footnote q: Revised to “treatment” arms (previously “combination” arms) to clarify 
that ADA samples from all treatment arms (including durvalumab monotherapy) will 
be collected within [ADDRESS_971951] study drug only.

Females of Childbearing Potential:
Females of childbearing potential must use at least one of the highly effective methods of 
contraception described in Table A1 from screening to [ADDRESS_971952].
Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile 
(ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or postmenopausal. The 
definition of postmenopausal status in this study include:
!Women < [ADDRESS_971953] been amenorrhoeic for ≥ [ADDRESS_971954]-menopausal range for the institution or 
underwent su rgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).
!Women ≥ [ADDRESS_971955] been amenorrhoeic for 
≥12 months in the absence of any exogenous hormonal treatment, or underwent surgical 
sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_49838]).
Non-sterilized Male Subjects
Non-sterilized male subjects must use a male condom with spermicide from screening to 
[ADDRESS_971956].

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98 of 110 Template 18.0Appendix B Additional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169939] a SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not consid ered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity bu t may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
!Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
!Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
!Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
!Blood dyscrasias (eg, neut ropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
!Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Assessment of Severity
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. Severity will be graded acc ording to the NCI CTCAE v5.0 as provided in 
below. The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0

Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death.
Grade [ADDRESS_971958]. The followi ng factors should be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that an AE may ha ve been caused by [CONTACT_7198].
!Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigational product. Has the subject actually 
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
!Consistency with known investigational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect investigational product (pharmacology and toxicology) 
or products of the same pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its 
pharmacological properties? 
MedImmune Protocol D9108C00002 (NeoCOAST) Amendment 2
Neoadjuvant durvalumab and novel oncology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 18Jan2019; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 100 of 110 Template 18.0!De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_469027]?
!No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_230614], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
!Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected investigational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? MedImmune would not normally recommend or 
support a re-challenge.
!Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
!Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the investigational product?
!Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as well as treatment-emergent 
SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required 
during the study (eg, blood collection, washout of an existing medication). The following guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_316788]:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to  an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 102 of 110 Template 18.0Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
D1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report potential Hy’s Law cases and Hy’s Law cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalities can be found in the Toxi city Management Guidelines (see Section 3.1.3 ).
During the course of the study, the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets 
potential Hy’s Law criteria at any point during the study.
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for th e determination of potential Hy’s Law and 
Hy’s Law events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visits and other visits including all local laboratory evaluations even if collected outside of the study visits.
The investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver biochemistry) for possible potential Hy’s Law events.
The investigator participates, together with MedImmune clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting potential Hy’s Law criteria to agree whether Hy’s 
Law criteria are met. Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry other than drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_7198]. 
The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to potential Hy’s Law/Hy’s Law
cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
D2 Definitions
D 2.1 Potential Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN at any point during the study 
following the start of investigational product irrespective of an increase in ALP.
D 2.2 Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the investigational product, can be found to explain the combination of increases; eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, or another drug.

Neoadjuvant durvalumab and novel oncology therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 18Jan2019; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 103 of 110 Template 18.0For potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law, the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be 
coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
D3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to identify cases of potential Hy’s Law, it is important to perform a comprehensive 
review of laboratory data for any subject w ho meets any of the following identif ication criteria 
in isolation or in combination:
!ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
!AST ≥ 3 × ULN
!TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
The investigator will, without delay, review each new laboratory report and if the 
identification cr iteria are met will:
!Notify the sponsor study representative
!Determine whether the subject meets potential Hy’s Law criteria (see Section D2) by 
[CONTACT_48886]
!Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF
D4 Follow-up
D 4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the subject does not meet potential H y’s Law criteria the investigator will:
!Inform the study representative that the s ubject has not met potential Hy’s Law criteria.
!Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory re sults according to the guidance provided in 
the study protocol.
D 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the subject does meet potential Hy’s Law criteria the investigator will:
!Notify the sponsor study representative who will then inform the study team
!Within 1 day of potential Hy’s Law criteria being met, the investigator will report the 
case as an SAE of Potential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and 
causality assessment ‘yes/related’ according to  clinical study protocol process for SAE 
reporting

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 104 of 110 Template 18.0The medical monitor cont acts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree on an 
approach for the study subjects’ follow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_280886]:
!Monitor the subject until liver bioc hemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. 
Complete the follow-up SAE Form as required.
!Investigate the etiology of the event and perfo rm diagnostic investigations as discussed 
with the medical monitor. 
!Complete the relevant CRF Modules as information becomes available
D5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this section should be followed for all cases where potential Hy’s Law
criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially  detected, th e medical 
monitor will contact [CONTACT_619979]’s Law criteria other than DILI 
caused by [CONTACT_7198], to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities per local requirements from the date potential Hy’s Law criteria were met. The medical monitor and Global Safety Physician will also be i nvolved in this review together 
with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the 
instructions below.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
!If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
!If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event 
term; causality and seriousness criteria) following the sponsor’s standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the investigational product:
!Send the updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to the sponsor’s standard 
processes.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 105 of 110 Template 18.0∀The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion s hould be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
∀As there is no alternative explanation for the Hy’s Law case, a causality assessment 
of ‘related’ should be assigned
If, there is an unavoidable delay of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for Hy’s Law, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
!Provide any further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law (report 
term now ‘Hy’s Law case’), ensuring causality as sessment is related to the investigational 
product and seriousness criteria ar e medically important, accord ing to the clinical study 
protocol process for SAE reporting
!Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether Hy’s Law criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted potential Hy’s 
Law SAE report following clinical study protocol process for SAE reporting, according to 
the outcome of the review and amend the reported  term if an alternative explanation for 
the liver biochemistry elevations is determined
D6 Laboratory Tests
To evaluate the underlying etiology of potential Hy’s Law cases, relevant laboratory tests will 
be performed as outlined in Section 4.3.4 . Additional laboratory assessments may be 
performed as clinically indicated.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY [ADDRESS_971959] v1.1 Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target Lesions
!CR- Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target 
or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if 
there are target nodes). 
!PR- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
!Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered PD.)
!Stable Disease (SD) - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on 
study.
Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
!CR- Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. 
All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 
!Non-CR/Non-PD - Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.
!PD- Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions will be defined as the overall 
level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy (see Section 4.1.6 ). In the absence of measurable disease, 
change in non-measurable disease comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a pleural 
effusion from ‘tr ace’ to ‘large,’ an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to 
widespread.
Appearance of New Lesions
The appearance of new lesions is considered PD according to RECIST v1.1. Considering the 
unique response kinetics that have been observed with immunotherapy, new lesions can nonetheless derive clinical benefit ( Borghaei et al, 2015 ). 
Evaluation of Overall Response
Table F1 provides ove rall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target 
and non-target lesions with or without the appearance of new lesions.

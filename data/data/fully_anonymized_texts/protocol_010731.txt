General Study Information 
 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Andrea Cheville, MD, MSCE               Study Title: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7447] a Pain Mana gement Intervention Preparatory to a Fu ture Pragmatic Trial (ASCENT)    
 Protocol version number and da te: October 3, 2023 V4     
 
Research Question and Aims 
 Hypothesis This study will adapt intervention components that were prev iously validated in several pragmatic clinical trials: 
E2C2 (#18-007779), NOHARM (#20-004839) and COPE (#11-008151), for remote  delivery to rural dwelling 
and Hispanic Cancer Survivors.   We  will refine the sociocultural, linguist ic, IT, and clinical aspects of the 
intervention through iterative design cycles. We recognize that the need s of the targeted subgroups are 
heterogeneous and may require patien t-specific matching of language, IT  modes, extent of portal-based 
delivery, among other aspects, in or der to optimize patient engagement  and experience.  Intervention 
components will be integrated and test ed in a future parallel group, two-ar m randomized clinical trial at six 
Mayo Clinic sites. The full tr ial is anticipated to begin later this year under a se parate IRB application.   
 We hypothesize that an iteratively refi ned, EHR-based modular approach that  combines specific intervention 
components in accordance with a patien t’s sociocultural, IT, and linguistic  needs, will demonstrate fidelity, 
usability, and acceptability among our target population of Hispanic, rural dwelling, and rural dwelling 
Hispanic cancer survivors experi ences moderate or worse pain. 
  Aims, purpose, or objectives 
To refine and pi[INVESTIGATOR_170772] a validated collaborative care model-based intervention aimed at 
improving pain control among rural dwelling and Hispanic cancer survivors. The intervention will align pain 
care with evidence-based best practices and address SDOH and other barriers to patient s’ receipt of appropriate 
care. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_170773], linguistic, and IT adaptation of the intervention for the target 
demographic to inform the implementation of the future Achieving Equity through SocioCulturally-informed, 
Digitally Enabled Cancer Pain ManagemeNT  (ASCENT) randomized control trial.   
 
Background    
Cancer pain is a key case study in  health disparities in the US.  Cancer pain is preval ent, undertreated, and 
remains a major cause of suffering, impa irment, and disability for millions of Americans.  Individual pain 
interventions and care models show promise for cancer pain in controlle d settings. Unfortunately, typi[INVESTIGATOR_170774], fail to consider  health disparities populations (HDPs), 
and are unable to serve broad and diverse populations. This  situation will only worsen with time. For example, 
by 2030, the number already underserved Hispanic cancer su rvivors in the U.S. will increase to 4 million.
  
 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_199946] eadily growing proportion of cancer survivors, but are 
also increasingly immigrati ng to rural communities, pot entially placing th em at “double risk” for poor 
outcomes. Digitally-facilitated solutions are especial ly well matched for these disparities, and can be 
customized to address the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], yet distinct, needs of these HDPs. Doing so would provide a vital proof 
of concept and may illustrate the promise of digitally based, patient-c entered approaches to 
mitigating other disparities. 
 
This preparatory pi[INVESTIGATOR_170775] w iterative refinement of intervention  components and study procedures to 
optimize their sociocultural and lingu istic  appropriateness, feasibility, and acceptability. The study will 
optimize patient-facing cancer pain support components of an  EHR-facilitated, evidence-based bundle in a 
manner that meets the diverse needs of the target sample. 
 
Study Design and Methods 
 
Methods  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will test our ASCE NT intervention at the following Mayo C linic locations: [COMPANY_002]ster, Arizona, 
[LOCATION_012], Mankato, Eau Claire  and La Crosse. For this minimal risk study without in-person patient contact, 
patients can be recruited from the pr eviously mentioned locations, but re search activities are only being 
conducted at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster and Mayo Clinic Ar izona. We will recruit th ree groups of individuals: 
Rural, Hispanic, Rural & Hispanic. Participants who are experiencing cancer-related pain and who meet 
inclusion criteria will be recruite d and will have the opportunity receive additional education material in an 
initial mailing as well as s upport from Pain Care Managers  (PCMs) and Community H ealth Workers (CHWs) to 
manage their pain. The study team will provide as much material as possible in Spanish for participants who 
speak only Spanish or prefer to read in Spanish. The study team includes members who speak Spanish fluently. 
These members may include, but are not  limited to study coordinators, PCMs, CHWs, and other support staff. If 
a patient speaks only Spanish and the team member doe s not, a telephone interpreter will be utilized. PCMs and 
CHWs will follow a validated pain management algorithm that includes evidence based and guideline-endorsed 
best practices for managing cancer related pain and addressing Social Dete rminants of Health (SDOH) barriers 
to receipt of recommended care. The ASCENT interventi ons in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_170776] e management of ca ncer-related pain.  
  Part 1 – Testing the ASCENT Intervention Components   Intervention Potentially eligible participants will be identified using data found in the Epic EHR Chronicles database, including qualifying appointments, ethnicity, RUCA highly rural zip code , and cancer diagnoses (Approved in 
IRB# 22-008103). Patients who meet the el ectronic criteria listed in this protocol will r eceive information about 
our study and a pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ques tionnaire via the patient portal, Welcome tablet 
functionality, or Interactive Voice Response (IVR). We ar e seeking a waiver of cons ent due to the volume of 
patients this would involve acr oss the [ADDRESS_199947] practice in caring for cancer su rvivors. IVR is an automated telephon e service provided by [CONTACT_170789] (RevSpring).  Research coordina tors will attempt to enroll and form ally consent patients who endorse

 pain >5/10 and who respond to this in itial outreach. Recruitment calls will al so be made to screen patients who 
do not respond for pi[INVESTIGATOR_170777] (See Recruitment & Consent section for more detail s). Patients will be able to 
opt out of hearing more in formation or being contact[CONTACT_426] a study coordinator at multiple points in the trial 
recruitment and enrollment procedures. After consent, participants may be sent additional education materials in 
an initial mailing. The en gagement, intake, visit 2, final visit, and follow up calls will  be recorded for fidelity 
monitoring. All study visits will be c onducted via telephone or video call.  
 
We will test prototype re cruitment scripts in English and Spanish.  At the end of the recruitm ent process, 
participants will be queried about their experience. For each call, CRCs will indicate sections of the script that seemed wordy, awkward, confusing, or prompted questions  from prospecive participant s.  We will additionally 
record recruitment conversations.  Tapes will be revi ewed by [CONTACT_170790], ASCENT implementation scientists, and CRCs.   
All data used to direct the IVR calls is maintained  on Mayo Clinic servers and no data are released to 
RevSpring. RevSpring has been used by [CONTACT_170791][INVESTIGATOR_170778]-up patient 
reported outcome measures to over two thousand patients.  The ASCENT pain NRS questionnaire responses will 
reside on our server and will not go outside of the firewall.  Data going to the RevSpring platform is transient in 
nature and is purged once the result s are uploaded into Epic. TAP approva l has been granted to RevSpring’s 
IVR system and there are Business A ssociate Agreements (BAA) and Inform ation Security Agreements (ISA) 
in place, which covers how PHI can be used and stored.  
 
Recruitment Call: The research coordinator will forma lly recruit interested and eligible participants. 
Eligibility criteri a include a pathologically confirmed solid or liquid can cer diagnosis, excluding acute 
leukemia, within 15 years of study enrollment; pain rated > 5/10; and a PH8-8 score of < 9. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_170779].  Patien ts who consent ot participate will be asked questions 
to determine their access to and facility with technological devices, a nd the extent to which they can 
access broadband internet. Should the participant need a device to participate in the visits described in 
this protocol, the study team will send one to them for temporary use. The res earch coordinator will then 
schedule a time for the participant to meet with the Pain Care Ma nager (PCM) and Community Health 
Worker (CHW) either via telephone or video visit. 
 Engagement Call: The CHW will meet with the participant via video vi sit or telephone to discuss the 
ASCENT study, gain an initial understanding of the pa tient’s pain, and introduce the practice of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a pain journal. The CHW will also obtain patient s’ SDOH background to iden tify barriers that may 
impact their ability to access pain treatment. The CHW will re view first and second-line treatment 
options so that the patient is awar e of the treatment options available to them. This conversation will be 
informed by a “Conversation Guid e” bundle developed for the study.  
 Intake Visit: The PCM and CHW will meet with the pa rticipant via video visit or telephone to discuss 
the cancer-related pain they are experiencing (PCM),  as well as obtain thei r SDOH background to help 
identify barriers that may impac t their ability to access pain treat ment (CHW). The PCM and CHW will 
work with the patient to develop an action plan to  help address their pain by [CONTACT_14662] a “Conversation 
Guide” bundle developed for the study. This guide w ill share approved patient education materials for 
self-guided pain management, pr ovide information on online tools,  (such as our study website) and 
structure interaction between the participant and PC M/CHW. Participants will be able to receive the 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/2017 
 
       Page 4 of 10 
 Conversation Guide in a variety of formats per their preference (portal,  paper mailing, web, email, etc). 
The conversation between the PCM a nd the participant will lead the PC M to make suggestions/referrals 
from the below Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions, which consis t of 6 treatment domains.  
  
 
T i e r  1       T i e r  2  
Exercise     Integrative Medicine  Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)   -Massage Medicine      -Acupuncture 
        - M i n d f u l n e s s         Spi[INVESTIGATOR_170780]        P a i n  C l i n i c  R e f e r r a l s         Palliative and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_170781]: A second visit will take place approxima tely 2 weeks after the intake visit, depending on 
the availability of the pa rticipant, PCM and CHW. In this visit,  the participant will give an update on 
their pain and additional resources may be suggested by [CONTACT_170792]/or CHW.  
 
Final Visit: The third visit will be the final visit between the participant, PCM and CHW and will take 
place approximately 4 weeks after the intake (dep ending on patient, PCM and CHW availability). 
Participant progress will be reviewed, final r ecommendations and referrals will be made.  
 
Participant Surveys: After a participant has completed the three visits listed a bove, they will be sent a 
short survey via email, mail or por tal to give feedback about their experience. Telephone may also be 
used to administer the survey. This  feedback may help facilitate a ny necessary changes for the future 
ASCENT trial.   
 
Follow Up Visits & NRS pain surveys: the CHW or  PCM may conduct  follow up calls between intake 
and visit 2 and/or between visit 2 an d the final visit. As pain levels, SDOH barriers and level of needed 
assistance vary from patient to patient, these will be  scheduled as needed on a participant-by-participant 
basis at the discretion of the PCM/CHW and partic ipant. Additionally, the participant will receive 
regular pain NRS surveys via portal and/or IVR. CH Ws and PCMs will check in with patients via portal 
or text message to see how patients are doi ng and if follow up vi sits are required.  
 Remuneration : Participants will be reimbursed for their part icipation in this study. They will receive $50 for 
the intake visit, $50 for visit 2, $50 fo r the final visit and $20 for the comple tion of the participant survey for a 
total of up to $170. No remuneration will be given for recr uitment or follow up calls. Payment will be submitted 
within [ADDRESS_199948] deposit via 
payroll for Mayo Employees.  Care Manager Conferences : The ASCENT study team will work co llaboratively with Medical Oncology, 
Social Work, Physical Therapy, Pallia tive Care, and other applicable areas  to address patient needs. Care 
Manager Conferences will take place weekly during this pi [INVESTIGATOR_170782] a 
collaborative approach can be addressed in a timely manner. During the conferences the PCM will present the patient’s pain and related issues to an interdiscip linary group of pain specialists potentially including 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_199949] 
practice approach that is integral to clinical practices across the Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Participants will not be 
involved in these conferences but the feedback gathered will help the PCM/CHW assist th e participant.  
 
Recruitment & Consent   
Using existing Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) tools, potentially eligible participants with a scheduled 
encounter in Medical Oncology, Hematol ogy, or Community Medicine will be id entified via an EHR report, which the 
study coordinator(s) will regularly pull. Those with a patient portal will be sent a study invitation via portal message prior 
to their encounter.  Nonresponders will receive the invitation during clinical registration on an Epic Welcome tablet.   
Patients who do not interact with the invitation via their protal  of Welcome tablet will be sent the invitation by [CONTACT_2319].  Any 
follow-up recruitment attempts being will be conducted via portal message, telephone , or mail. Patients who do not have a 
portal set up will be initially invited to participate via Epic Welcome tablet.  Non responders will be approached via mail 
or telephone, with follow-up recruitment attempts being done via telephone. Potential participants will not be contact[CONTACT_170793] 3 times total.   We are seeking a waiver of signed informed consent as we ll as a waiver of signed HIPAA for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_170783] l. Due to the minimal risk this study poses, as well as the 
complexities of recruiting rural and Hispanic populations and the likelihood of including undocumented Hispanic 
participants, we think a waiver is justified cons istent with the intent of existing regulations. 
 Consenting will be conducted orally, at which point the particip ants will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The research coordinator will administer a few IT rela ted questions to assess technology usage and fluency.  
 
Part 2 – Qualitative Interviews & Focus Groups   Patient Interviews : A subset of participants (up to 40 total) will be recruited to take part in an interview about 
their experience in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  Our goal is to reach thematic saturation. We will assu me that thematic saturation 
has been reached when further observ ations and analysis reveal no new th emes. Those who are interested will 
meet one time with a member of our study team via telepho ne or video. We are seek ing approval for oral 
consent and waiver of HIPAA for the same reasons outlined in the intervention recruitment section of this protocol. Remuneration in the amount of $30 will be given for participation in this interview. The interview will 
be recorded and transcribed for data analysis purposes and stored on a secured server.   Study Team Interviews: Up to 15 ASCENT study interventionalists will be interviewed and asked for feedback 
and experiences from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Recruitment will be  done via email and the oral consent document will be 
attached to the email. A response to th e invitation to schedule an interview will be regarded as an agreement to 
participate. No remuneration wi ll be given for participation.  
 Provider Focus Groups: 2-[ADDRESS_199950] of this additional s upport to patients on provider 
workflow and obtain feedback about wh at they may like to see from the fu ture ASCENT trial (e.g., how they 
want to be informed when their patients are enrolled in ASCENT, what in formation about their patients’ pain 
management they would like to  be alerted to and how). Recruitment will  be done via email and the oral consent 
document will be attached to the email. A response to the invitation to schedule an interview will be regarded as 
an agreement to participate.No remunera tion will be given for participating.

Intervention Fidelity 
All of the above components of the intervention are regarded as “impor tant” but not “essential” to the patient 
experience in the trial. We will assess fidelity by [CONTACT_170794]: recruitment, intake  call, unscheduled CHW contacts, 
planning call, and scheduled PCM check-ins.  For pi[INVESTIGATOR_170784].  Two individuals 
to review transcripts of the touchpoint s and document whether >95% of essent ial elements are present.  If an 
encounter includes fewer that 95% of the elements, the in terventionalists will review training materials and role 
play the touchpoint with senior ASCENT team members.   
 
Measurement  Refinement of Intervention Components: Assessment of the usability and a cceptability of specific intervention components and study processes will 
require data collection appropr iate to these study compone nts and will be tailored to each touchpoint.  In 
addition to multi-stakeholder review of recorded interactions, CRC- and PCM-identified ineffective script 
sections, participant-reported experience, extent and nature of family/lay caregiver involvement, and fidelity checklists, touchpoint specifi c assessments will include: 
 Recruitment – proportion of opened and completed Epic questionnaires, proportion of patients calling the 
ASCENT 1-[ADDRESS_199951].  Engagement and Intake Visits – propor tion of patients who provide complete pain and SDOH histories, select a 
Tier 1 pain management option, and develop a SMART goal; proportion of patients requesting review of Tier 2 options, patient engagement with s ections of the ASCENT Conversati on Guide (assessed by [CONTACT_170795] 11-point numerical rating scales (NRS). 
 Planning Visit – proportion of patients requesting revisions to the recomm ended plan, proportion of patients 
completing SMART goal; category of pain intervention sele cted as initial focus of multi-modal pain care plan; 
type of participant-select ed provider as PCM contact. 
 Final Visit – proportion of patien ts able to receive and ini tiate use of modality select ed during the planning visit, 
category of barriers impeding receipt  of recommended pain care, genera l assessment of ASCENT program 
(NRS).   Follow Up Visits & NRS pain surveys: Proportion of patients completing surveys by [CONTACT_170796], 
cause of pain escalation (categorical), participant-perceived ba rriers (categorical). 
  PROM collection: The following outcome measures will be  collected at baseline (after cons ent but required before moving on to 
engagement) and when patients exit the pi[INVESTIGATOR_170785] 4-5 weeks: 
 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IR B [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_199952] PROM  data via telephone interview with a CRC. 
 
Risks and Benefits The risks of the ASCENT pi[INVESTIGATOR_170786]-related pain.  Nothing in this trial will impede patients them from 
getting whatever pain modalities they  and their team agree they need.  The benefits to patients include the 
potential for safer and more guidelin e-concordant pain management and lower risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_170787].  
 
Protection of Human Subjects Care will be taken to ensure that patients’ data ar e protected. Data from chart review, patient-reported 
preferences, and patient-reported outcom es will be stored securely on password protected Mayo Clinic research 
servers. Clinicians will still be able  to make professional judgments about the appropriateness of engaging 
patients in specific conversations ab out pain management throughout thei r post-surgical recovery, and may 
disregard EHR-prompts as appropriate.  
Subject Information 
 Target accrual is the proposed total number of subjects to be in cluded in this study at Mayo Clinic. A “Subject”

Data Anal ysis 
  Power analyses may not be appropriate if  this is a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_39400], but end-point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory . Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the information.   Endpoints: Optimized components and process Our target endpoint is optimization of  key study processes and intervention components.  We will use modified, 
multi-stakeholder Delphi processes to determine when a study process/ component has been optimized.  A  
process/component will be considered optimized when  80% of De lphi process participants agree that 
sociocultural appropriatness, usabilit y, patient-centricity, and acceptability have been optimized.  After that 
point no further iterative refi nement cycles will occur. 
 Response rates Our goal is to achieve >90% response rates for PROM assessments, recruitm ent questionnaires, and remote pain 
assessments.  Iterative design cycles  will continue with diffe rent modes, delivery approaches, follow up for non-
response, and preface text.  Qualitative data We will incrementally and iteratively develop a  coding scheme beginning with the first 
transcript. Categories, groups of content sharing common f eatures, will be created a nd abstraction of the text 
will be accomplished by [CONTACT_170797]. Subcat egories will be identified to further delineate the 
content. Finally, themes or ideas that cut across categor ies will be created. As new concepts emerge, they will 
be defined and added to the coding scheme. If data satu ration is not reached we w ill consider the need for 
additional interviews.

 Future trial endpoints 
Primary:  Brief Pain Inventory Secondary: PROMIS Physical Function, Sleep Distur bance and Anxiety Comput erized Adaptive Tests  
We will assess the psychometric perfor mance of the PROM study endpoints in target subgroups.   In addition to 
calculating descriptive st atistics  for primary and secondary outcomes  at baseline and when participants go off 
study, we will graph PROM scores in aggregate and by [CONTACT_170798]-defined subgroups to assess for ceiling 
and floor effects and distribut ion of scores across the full trait range.  Although the anticipated sample sizes will 
be limited, 20 Hispanics and 20 rural dwellers,  we will compare measures of central tendency and variance in 
participants’ PROM scores to those repor ted for other cohorts  and used to cal culate the full trial’s sample size. 
This will clarify the whether review of th e trial’s power calculation is warranted.

Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981091] frequent cause of cancer death in both men and 
women in North America, accounting for approximately 13% of all cancers 
diagnosed and 28% of all cancer deaths.  There will be an estimated 
173,770 new lung cancer cases in the [LOCATION_002] in the year 2004 with 
an estimated 160,440 deaths due to lung cancer.1 Seventy -five percent of 
patients with bronchogenic carcinoma will be diagnosed with non -small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  The number of patients with early or localized 
disease (currently an estimated 15 -20% of NSCLC patients)[ADDRESS_981092] 
scanning.  
 
The treatment of choice for stage I (T1 -T2N0) NSCLC is surgical resection 
which results in 5 -year survival rates of approximately 60 to 70%.3-5 
Occasionally, however, there are patients with early -stage NSCLC that are 
unable to tolerate surgical resection or the postoperative recovery period 
due to various comorbidities.  
 
While conventionally fractionated radiation therapy has been utilized as 
nonsurgical therapy for these medically inoperable patient s, close 
observation with no specific cancer therapy has also been advocated in 
highly selected cases.  McGarry, et. al., reviewed outcomes in 75 patients 
who had received no specific cancer therapy for stage I NSCLC, and the 
cause of death was progressive  cancer in 53% of cases with a median 
survival time of 14.2 ± 2.4 months.6 
 
Definitive conventionally fractionated RT for early -stage NSCLC  is 
considered reasonable non -surgical therapy but yields poor 5 -year survival 
rates ranging from 10 to 30%.7-[ADDRESS_981093] conventionally fractionated 4,500 to 6,600 cGy. This benefit was 
evident in both survival and local control in these patients.10-14 Sibley, et. 
al., reviewed 156 medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC 
treated with primary RT at Duke University between 1980 and 1995. They 
reported a 5 -year, cause -specific survival rate of 32%. There was a trend 
toward improved survival in those patients achieving local control which 
approached significance for higher RT doses (p = 0.07).[ADDRESS_981094] published a series treating 56 patients with medically 
inoperable NSCLC with a median dose of 70 Gy using conformal 
radiotherapy techniques.15 Actuarial local control rates were 69% and 63% 
at two - and three years of follow up, respectively.  These data serve as the 
estimate for statistical power calculations fo r this trial.  
 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981095] historically encompassed the primary tumor as well 
as the regional lymphatics in the ipsilateral hilum and mediastinum. This 
elective treatment was based on the identified risk of occult lymph node 
involvement ranging u p to 20% in some surgical series.16 In recent years, 
elimination of elective nodal irradiation, which is potentially poorly 
tolerated in this population,17 has been validated by [CONTACT_718867].18-21 Slotman, et. al., in a study from the Netherlands, reported the 
use of limited "postage -stamp" fields to treat early stage lung cancer 
patients using hypofractionated RT ( i.e., 4,800 cGy in 400 -cGy fractions). 
Reported 3 -year overall and disease -specific survival rates were 42% and 
76%, respectively.[ADDRESS_981096] revolutionized the delivery of 
radiation doses appropriate for tumor cell killing.  
 
In thi s new era of three -dimensional treatment planning, more precise 
delivery methods are available allowing for dose escalation to the target 
volume without excessive dose being deposited in normal tissues. The 
RTOG has completed an extensive dose escalation s tudy of 
conventionally fractionated three -dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D -
CRT) for NSCLC for stages I, II, and III disease as long as all detectable 
tumor can be encompassed by [CONTACT_718868] l ymph nodes.22 No mechanism for minimizing 
lung and tumor movements was utilized.  One hundred and seventy -nine 
patients were treated with radiation doses escalated to as high as 90.3 
Gy.  Patients were stratified within each dose level according to the 
percentage of the total lung volume that received >20 Gy with the 
treatment plan (V 20). For patients receiving radiation alone or radiation 
following induction chemotherapy, data from RTOG 9311 established that 
the radiation dose could be safely escalated usi ng 3D -CRT techniques to 
83.8 Gy for patients with V 20 values of <25% and to 77.4 Gy for patients 
with V 20 values between 25% and 36%, using fraction sizes of 2.15 Gy. 
Excess mortality was observed at 90.3 Gy with two dose -related deaths. 
The incidence of g rade 3 or higher acute toxicity is less than 10%; 
however, grade 3 or higher late toxicity was approximately 15%.  
 
1.2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy  
 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the delivery of high 
precision, biologically potent doses of radiation to tumors of the chest, 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 6 of 37 
 abdomen, and pelvis. Implementing elements of 3D -CRT with stereotactic 
targeting, SBRT permits delivery of 3 -4 high  dose fractions totaling 48 -60 
Gy with good local control and low toxicity.  
 
Blomgren, et. al., from the Karolinska Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_718850], Sweden 
reported the results of over 100 patients treated in the extracranial 
stereotactic frame (developed by [CONTACT_718869][INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
for metastases in the chest and abdomen beginning in 1992.23, [ADDRESS_981097] scans to assess response to treatment 
demonstrated disappearance in 35%, reduction in 41%, sta bilization in 
18%, and progression in only one patient (the largest tumor treated in the 
report).  Because of concern for acute inflammatory effects, all patients 
were pre -medicated with corticosteroids prior to treatment.  Side effects 
were, however, limi ted and primarily consisted of fatigue and fever for a 
few days after the treatments.  One patient experienced typi[INVESTIGATOR_718851], with subsequent fibrosis, and 
another developed a chronic cough.  There was no severe l ate pulmonary 
toxicity or treatment -related deaths.  
 
A phase I dose escalation trial has been completed at Indiana University 
for treatment of medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC.26, 27 
SBRT was administered with large doses per fraction in an  extracranial 
stereotactic body frame, which includes a system for decreasing breathing 
motion. The starting dose was 8 Gy times 3 (24 Gy total), and fraction 
dose was escalated by 2 Gy per fraction for each cohort.  The target 
lesion was outlined by a phy sician and designated as the gross tumor 
volume (GTV).  An additional 0.[ADDRESS_981098] was added to the GTV to constitute the PTV based on 
validation measurements for this commercially available system.23, 28, 29 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 7 to 10 non -coplanar beams were used to encompass the PTV.  
Dose was prescribed to the 80% isodose line. However, higher isodoses 
occurred within the center of the target mimicking the heterogeneous dose 
profile common to intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery.  The treatment 
isocenter was id entified with 3 -D coordinates defined stereotactically and 
localized on verniers attached to the frame. No skin or bony landmarks 
were used to set the treatment isocenter; however, orthogonal port films 
were used on a daily basis for isocenter verification .30 Separate dose 
escalations were carried out independently for patients with T1 versus T2 
small (≤ 5 cm) versus T2 large (5-7 cm) tumors at diagnosis.  
 
According to the Indiana University protocol guidelines, dose -limiting 
toxicity (DLT) was any grade 3 cardiac or pulmonary toxicity or any grade 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981099] dose escalation proto col with 3 patient cohorts with 
minimum 1 month between dose levels to assess toxicity. Patients were 
categorized into separate independent dose escalations according to 
tumor volume, T1 vs. T2 (≤ 5 cm) vs. T2 (> 5 to ≤ 7 cm). Grade 3 
pneumonitis was seen at a dose of 14 x 3 = 42 Gy total in one T2 patient 
with a 7 -cm tumor and transient grade 3 hypoxia was seen at 16 x 3 = [ADDRESS_981100] x -ray after 
treatment. Nine of these patients had a decline of an element of their 
pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, DLCO, or PO2) by 10 -20% of 
predicted which returned bac k to baseline values with follow -up in all but 
two. The timing of onset of this toxicity was generally acute to subacute (< 
[ADDRESS_981101] cases).  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not 
reached on this trial for patients with T1 tumors and smaller T2 t umors (≤ 
5 cm).  Dose -limiting pneumonitis or pericarditis occurred in 2/5 patients 
with larger T2 tumors (>5 to ≤ 7 cm) at a dose of 24 x 3 = 72 Gy defining 
the MTD for this subgroup at 22 x 3 = 66 Gy.  Patients treated at a dose of 
22 Gy per fraction tim es three fractions had follow up of over 24 months 
without late toxicity for all T -stage tumor categories.  Treatment failure 
within the PTV has been observed in 8 of 26 patients treated at doses of 
up to 20 x 3 = 60 Gy.  However, all but one of these loca l failures occurred 
at doses of 16 x 3 = 48 Gy or lower.31 
 
Onishi, et. al., showed that patients treated with biologically effective 
doses (BED) of 100 Gy [using BED = nd(1 +d/ /), where n = number of 
fractions, d =  dose per fraction, and / = 10 for acute -reacting tissue] 
had better local control and survival compared to those receiving BED 
<100 Gy. Local recurrence rates were significantly lower for tumors 
treated with BED 100 Gy (8.1% vs. 26.4%, p < 0.01). The 3 -year overall 
survival rate of medically operable patients was 88.4% for BED 100 Gy 
compared with 69.4% for BED <[ADDRESS_981102] an increased risk of radiation pneumonitis associated with 
conventional large volume radiation fields.  SBRT permits dose escalation 
by [CONTACT_718870] -dose treatment volume.  
 
The RTOG opened in May 2004 a phase II trial of SBRT in the treatment 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 8 of 37 
 of medically inoperable patients with stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer 
in an effort to determine if SBRT could achieve acceptable local control as 
seen in retrospective series.24, 26, 32 -38 A secondary objective is to 
determine if this technique achieves acceptable treatment -related toxicity. 
In this trial, patients with T1, T2 (≤ 5 cm), or T3 (≤ 5 cm), N0, M0 medically 
inoperable non -small cell lung can cer are treated with SBRT to a total of 
[ADDRESS_981103] and structures 
of the mediastinum as well as patients with any T -stage tumor within or 
touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree.  This region is defined as 
a volume 2 cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree (carina, 
right and left main bronchi, right and left upper lobe bronchi, intermedius 
bronchus, right middle l obe bronchus, lingular bronchus, and right and left 
lower lobe bronchi). See figure below:  
 
Figure 1.0  
 
1.3 Rationale for Proposed SBRT Dose Schema  
 
Because the proximal bronchial tree functions more as a serial organ 
similar to the hollow viscera (e.g. GI tr act) as opposed to the periphery of 
the lungs which function in parallel with inherent redundancy, focal 
radiation injury to the central lung structures such as the bronchi can 
theoretically adversely affect the distal parenchyma. For this reason and 
becau se of their proximity to large blood vessels, central lung tumors have 
been excluded from most SBRT trials. The tolerance of the bronchial tree 

 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981104] 
treated patients with central lung lesions  on their SBRT trials without 
adverse consequences.  Doses of 60 Gy delivered in 3 fractions of 20 Gy 
each were tolerated by [CONTACT_718871] (unpublished 
data).   Onishi and colleagues made no effort to restrict the location of 
eligible tum ors, irrespective of whether they were located adjacent to a 
major bronchus or blood vessel. Seventeen patients (6.9%) experienced 
symptomatic radiation -induced pulmonary toxicity (grade >1), 88% of 
which had pulmonary fibrosis or emphysema prior to SBRT. Pulmonary 
symptoms resolved in most patients with or without steroid therapy. No 
vascular or cardiac complications were encountered.[ADDRESS_981105] reported a case of chronic radiation bronchitis in a 73 
year old woman with medically inoperable T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma of 
the lung which developed as a severe cough 6 months after treatment with 
SBRT to 50 Gy in 5 fractions of 10 Gy each. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy 
revealed thick circumferentially coated bronchial mucosa in a segmental 
bronchus which was located within the 90% dose area. A follow -up 
bronchoscopy at 12 months confirmed marked stenosis in the segmental 
bronchus without tumor pro gression.39 
 
The efficacy and safety of endobronchial  brachytherapy (EBBT) in which 
high doses per fraction are delivered to the bronchi from within have been 
well established in the literature. This well -tolerated procedure delivers 
very high doses of radiation to the bronchial mucosa with a low 
complicatio n rate and provides a high likelihood for durable palliation of 
symptoms that are associated with endobronchial tumors. Given the 
paucity of data evaluating the toxicity of SBRT for central lung tumors, a 
crude comparison with EBBT is reasonable.  
 
Speiser  and Spratling described radiation bronchitis and stenosis 
secondary to high dose rate endobronchial irradiation which occurred in 
12% of patients.40, 41 The complication rate increased slightly with 
concurrent external beam radiation therapy, curative intent, prior laser 
photoresection, and/or large cell his tology. There was no significant 
difference in complication rate between the three study groups receiving 
10 Gy at 5 mm depth via medium dose rate EBBT for three fractions, 10 
Gy at 10 mm depth via high dose rate EBBT for three fractions, or 7.5 Gy 
at 10 m m depth via high dose rate EBBT for three fractions. Radiation 
bronchitis and stenosis (RBS) was defined in this study as a spectrum of 
clinical changes which occurred in the tracheobronchial tree as seen on 
follow -up bronchoscopy 6 weeks after the EBBT tr eatment. Higher grade 
(grade 3 and 4) RBS was characterized by a severe inflammatory 
response with marked membranous exudates and mild to severe 
fibrosis/stenosis requiring various interventions to re -establish the full 
lumen of the airway. This degree of late toxicity developed in 6% of 
patients with means of 43 and 55 weeks for grade 3 and 4, respectively. 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 10 of 37 
 Intervention was typi[INVESTIGATOR_718852] 4 
reactions because of the circumferential fibrosis leading to progressive 
reduction  in the luminal diameter of the bronchus. Fatal hemoptysis 
occurred with an overall rate of 7.3%. In all cases, patients dying of 
massive hemoptysis had residual or recurrent carcinoma seen on 
bronchoscopy, post -mortem exam, and/or radiographic studies. Th ere 
were no proven cases of necrosis into the pulmonary artery in the 
absence of residual or recurrent carcinoma.  
 
M. D. Anderson has reported their ten -year experience with EBBT. Most 
patients received 3,000 cGy via EBBT delivered to a depth of 6 mm and 
divided into 2 fractions of 1500 cGy each over 2 weeks. Complications 
occurred in 19 out of 175 treated patients (11 % crude rate) with an 
actuarial complication rate of 13% at [ADDRESS_981106] 
ratio of 5%.[ADDRESS_981107] repo rted a very low complication rate in their 
published experience of 95 patients with inoperable endobronchial lung 
tumors treated with either 7.5 Gy times three one week apart or 10 Gy 
times two one week apart. Endobronchial irradiation was delivered to a 
1.0-cm depth using remote afterloading high dose rate brachytherapy with 
iridium -192. Sixty patients (63%) had previously received large field 
external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to 46 Gy. Estimated BED for acute -
reacting tissues (α/β = 10) was 40 Gy for EBBT  and 55.2 Gy for EBRT. 
One patient (1%) had hemoptysis in week [ADDRESS_981108] be taken 
to optimize the delivery and fractionation of SBRT for central lung tumors 
in order to provide good local tumor control while minimizing toxici ty.  
 
Accurate and precise treatment planning and delivery methods should be 
employed in an effort to reduce the deleterious effects of setup error and 
organ motion. Deep inspi[INVESTIGATOR_212746] -hold techniques and respi[INVESTIGATOR_718853] a beam -on mode is triggered by [CONTACT_718872][INVESTIGATOR_718854].44, 45 
Others are studying a surrogate marker for tumor motion which is detected 
by a tracking system that allows the radiation source to follow the position 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981109] recent technological advances in adaptive 
image -guided radiotherapy provides the Siteman Cancer Center a unique 
environment to deliver SBRT and track i ts efficacy. Four -dimensional 
computed tomography (4D -CT) and Varian Real -time Position Monitor® 
(RPM) together allow for accurate monitoring of and compensation for 
individualized tumor movement. T he Varian Trilogy® linear accelerator 
provides improved ef ficiency with online localization using the onboard 
cone -beam kV CT which will eliminate the need for a pretreatment CT 
simulation. Furthermore, the Trilogy has been developed specifically as a 
stereotactic radiotherapy treatment machine calibrated to a pr ecision of 
within 0.5 mm and capable of delivering SBRT with a specific high dose 
rate 6 MV photon beam at up to 1000 MU/min. The fluoroscopic 
capabilities of the Onboard Imager® will provide additional confirmation of 
coverage of the tumor during normal b reathing motion.  
 
With the improved accuracy and efficiency of the above tools, evaluation 
of SBRT for central lung tumors is feasible and desirable. We, therefore, 
propose a dose escalation schema starting with doses that are considered 
safe but suboptim al for tumor control (i.e. BED approaching 100 Gy), and 
escalating the dose per fraction to reach more optimal BED values. In 
order to reduce the toxicity of this treatment, we feel it is logical to 
increase the number of fractions from the current RTOG pr otocol.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_981110] 3 months of minimum follow 
up were required prior to opening the next dose level to accrual.  
 
The mean (range) of follow up duration for cohorts A (n=5), B  (n=6), C  
(n=6), and D  (n=5) are 22.9 (6 -47), 25.3 (2 -42), 17.3 (13 -22), and 6.6 (1 -
11) months, respectively.  Two additional patients recently completed 
therapy on cohort C and are awaiting their initial follow up.  Two patients 
treated to [ADDRESS_981111] been no protocol -related toxicities to date. 
The overall primary tumor control rate is 95.8%.  One primary tumor failure 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981112] occurred thus within 
cohorts B , C, or D.  Sixteen of 24 patients remain alive with a projected 3 -
year overall survival rate of 54.3%.  Based on the outstanding local control 
achieved at [ADDRESS_981113] chosen to proceed 
to Phase II of this trial.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVE S 
 
1. The primary objective  of the Phase I portion of this study is to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the 
trachea and proximal bronchial tree.  
 
2. The primary objective  of the phase II portion of this study is to determine if the 
MTD determined in Phase I achieves acceptable local control (i.e. >80%) for 
this medically inoperable population of patients with non -small cell lung 
cancer.  
 
3. The secondary objective  of Phase II is  to estimate the rates of regional nodal 
recurrence, disseminated recurrence, disease -free and overall survival at two 
years.  
 
 
3.0 ELIGIBILITY

2. Staging studies must identify patient as AJCC Stage I or II based on only 1 of 
following combinations of TNM staging:

3. Primary tumor must be arising in one of the following central chest locations:  
a. Within or touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree  (a volume 2cm 
in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree [carina, R & L main 
bronchi, R & L upper lobe bronchi, inte rmedius bronchus, R middle lobe 
bronchus, lingular bronchus, R & L lower lobe bronchi]) - see Figure 1  
b. Adjacent to (within 5 mm) or invading the mediastinal pleura  
c. Adjacent to (within 5 mm) or invading the parietal pericardium  
4. To differentiate T3 lesions i nvolving the mediastinal pleura from T4 lesions 
involving major vessels or organs, a chest MRI will be obtained. If any 
uncertainty remains, the patient will have four -dimensional CT scans (4DCT) 
in an effort to determine the degree of tumor motion.  A fre ely mobile tumor 
during ventilation will be judged to be T3 disease.  
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 13 of 37 
 5. Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes <1cm and no abnormal hilar or 
mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0.   Patients with >1cm hilar or 
mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or  abnormal PET (including suspi[INVESTIGATOR_718855]-diagnostic uptake) may be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all 
abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer.  
6. Primary tumor must be technically resectable by [CONTACT_718874], w ith a reasonable possibility of obtaining a gross total 
resection with negative margins (potentially curative resection, 
PCR).   However, patients must have underlying physiological medical 
problems prohibiting PCR (i.e., problems with general anesthesia, t he 
operation, the post -op recovery period, or removal of adjacent functioning 
lung) or refuse surgery.   Deeming a patient medically inoperable based on 
pulmonary function for surgical resection may include any of the 
following:   baseline FEV1 <40% predicte d; post -operative predicted FEV1 
<30% predicted; severely reduced diffusion capacity; baseline hypoxemia 
and/or hypercapnia; exercise oxygen consumption <50% predicted; severe 
pulmonary hypertension; diabetes with severe end organ damage; severe 
cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease; or severe chronic heart 
disease.  Any one of these problems will qualify a patient for this trial.

4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this 
study.  Patients will also be identified by [CONTACT_22705], middle, and last initials.  If 
the patient has no middle  initial, a dash will be used on the case report 
forms (CRFs).  All data will be recorded with this identification number on 
the appropriate CRFs.  
 
 
5.0 RADIATION THERAPY  
 
5.1 Dose Specifications  
 
5.1.1  Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
 
The term “stereotactic” for the purposes of this protocol implies the 
targeting, planning, and directing of therapy using beams of 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981117] skin marks or bony landmarks that 
are indirectly referenced to the tumor.  This known 3D coordinate 
system may include external fiducial markers (i.e.  Elekta body 
frame), internal fiducial markers (i.e. gold s eeds), or image -guided 
systems using either on -board kV or cone beam CT imaging (i.e. 
Varian Trilogy linear accelerator).  
 
5.1.2  Dose Fractionation  
 
Patients will receive 5 fractions of radiation according to Table 1. 
The dose for all patients will be 9 to 12 Gy per fraction to the 
prescription line at the edge of the PTV, depending on the dose 
level assigned for the patient.  
 
Table 1: Phase I Dose Es calation Scheme  
Dose 
Level  Fractionation  Biological Equivalent 
Tumor Dose  
1 9 Gy x 5 fractions  85.5 Gy  
2 10 Gy x 5 fractions  100 Gy  
3 11 Gy x 5 fractions  115.5. Gy  
4 12 Gy x 5 fractions  132 Gy  
 
* Each patient must have a minimum follow up period of 3 months 
prior to proceeding to the next dose level.  After completing accrual 
to dose levels 2 and 3 (during the 3 month assessment window) 
accrual to the trial may continue at the previous ‘safe’ dos e level.  
For example, if dose level 1 proves safe, patients can be accrued 
and treated at dose level 1 during the 3 month window of toxicity 
assessment between dose levels 2 and 3.   
 
5.1.3  Premedications  
 
Unless contraindicated, it is recommended that all patients receive 
corticosteroid premedication (e.g. Decadron 4 mg p.o. in a single 
dose, or equivalent) 15 -60 minutes prior to each of the three 
treatments for the intended purpose of modulating immediate 
pulmonary inflammatory effects. Analgesic premedication to avoid 
general discomfort during long treatment durations also is 
recommended when appropriate.  
  
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 16 of 37 
  
5.2 Technical Factors  
 
5.2.1  Physical Factors  
 
Only photon (x -ray) beams produced by [CONTACT_718876]. Photon beams with energies of 6 MV are preferred.  
Photon beam energies greater than 10 MV but not more than 15 
MV will only be allowed for a limited number (≤ 2) beams that must 
travel  more than a cumulative distance of 10 cm through soft tissue 
(not lung) to reach the isocenter.  
 
5.2.2  Minimum Field Aperture (Field Size) Dimension  
 
Due to uncertainties in beam commissioning resulting from 
electronic disequilibrium within small beam apertures , a minimum 
field dimension of 3.5 cm is required for any field used for treatment 
delivery. It is understood that this may exceed the technical 
requirements listed in Section 5.4 for small lesions (< 2.5 cm axial 
GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm cranio -caudal GT V dimension). In such 
cases, the prescription dose is still prescribed to the edge of the 
defined PTV.  
 
5.2.3  Dose Verification at Treatment  
 
Personal dosimeter measurements (e.g. diode, TLD, etc.) must be 
obtained for surface dose verification for accessible beams for the 
first fraction.  
 
5.3 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
 
5.3.1  Patient Positioning  
 
Patients will be positioned in a stable  position capable of allowing 
accurate reproducibility of the target position from treatment to 
treatment. Positions uncomfortable for the patient should be 
avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled movement during treatments. 
A variety of immobilization syste ms may be utilized including 
stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three sides and 
large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients external contours) with 
reference to the stereotactic coordinate system. Patient 
immobilization must be reliable enoug h to insure that the Gross 
Tumor Volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the confines of the 
Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) as defined in Section 5.4 with 
any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  
 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981118] of 
internal organ motion (i.e. breathing, etc.) on target positioning and 
reproducibility. Acceptable maneuvers including reliable abdominal 
compression and accelerator beam gating with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_280493].  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_981119] localization of the GTV isocenter is required prior to each 
fraction.  The process is as follows:  A limited CT scan designed to 
encompass the GTV will be obtained.  The GTV will be contoured 
by [CONTACT_718877].  These x, y, and z coordinates will be used to 
set up the patient for stereotactic therapy.  If the patient requires 
transfer from the CT couch to the treatment couch, isocenter 
localization images (anterior/p osterior and lateral) should be 
obtained prior to each treatment on the treatment unit to ensure 
proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e., isocenter) of the 
simulated fields.  
 
5.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
 
5.4.1  Image Acquisition  
 
Computed Tomography (CT) using four -dimensional imaging 
techniques will be the primary image platform for targeting and 
treatment planning. The planning CT scans must allow 
simultaneous view of the patient anatomy and fiducial system for 
stereotactic targe ting and must be done with IV contrast, unless the 
patient has allergic problems with contrast or has renal 
insufficiency. Contrast will allow better distinction between tumor 
and adjacent vessels or atelectasis. Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 
degrees wi ll be required with spacing ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_981120] lines, disc, or tape. The target lesion will be outlined by [CONTACT_718878] (GTV). The target will generally be drawn using CT 
pulmonary windows.  However, soft tissue windows with contrast 
may be used to avoid inclusion of adjacent vessels, atelectasis, or 
mediastinal or chest wall structures within the GTV. This target will 
not be enlarged whatsoever for prophylactic treatment 
(including no “margin” for presumed microscopic extension); 
rather, only include abnormal CT signal consistent with gross 
tumor (i.e., the GTV and the Clinical Target Volume, CTV, are 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 18 of 37 
 identical) . An additional 0.[ADDRESS_981121] (cranio -caudal) will be added to the GTV to 
constitute the planning treatment volume (PTV). These margins will 
be used at all sites, even if a particular site uses equipment or 
techn iques felt to be more accurate.  
 
5.4.2  Dosimetry  
 
Three -dimensional coplanar or non -coplanar beam arrangements 
will be custom designed for each case to deliver highly conformal 
prescription dose distributions. Non -opposing, noncoplanar beams 
are preferable. Typi [INVESTIGATOR_897], 7 -10 beams of radiation will be used with 
roughly equal weighting. Generally, more beams are used for larger 
lesion sizes. When static beams are used, a minimum of 7 non -
opposing beams should be used. For arc rotation techniques, a 
minimum of 340 de grees (cumulative for all beams) should be 
utilized. For this protocol, the isocenter is defined as the common 
point of gantry and couch rotation for the treatment unit. Field 
aperture size and shape should correspond nearly identically to the 
projection o f the PTV along a beam’s eye view (i.e. no additional 
“margin” for dose build up at the edges of the blocks or MLC jaws 
beyond the PTV). The only exception will be when observing the 
minimum field dimension of 3.5 cm when treating small lesions (see 
above) . As such, prescription lines covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_718856] 60 -90% line (rather than 95 -100%); however, higher 
isodoses (hotspots) must be manipulated to occur within the target 
and not in adjacent normal tissue. The isocenter in stereotactic 
coordinates may be determined either from fiducial markers or 
directly from the tumor using image -guidance and translated to the 
treatment record. The treatment dose plan will be made up of 
multiple static beams or arcs as described above. The plan should 
be n ormalized to a defined point corresponding closely to the 
center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be 
the isocenter of the beam rotation.  However, it is not a protocol 
requirement for this point to be the isocenter. Regardless, the p oint 
identified as COM PTV must have defined stereotactic coordinates 
and receive 100% of the normalized dose. Because the beam 
apertures coincide nearly directly with the edge of the PTV (little or 
no added margin), the external border of the PTV will be c overed 
by a lower isodose surface than usually used in conventional 
radiotherapy planning – typi[INVESTIGATOR_195088] 80%, but ranging from 60 -
90%. The prescription dose ranging from 45 to 60 Gy in five 
fractions (per patient dose assignment) will be delivered to t he 
margin of the PTV and fulfill the requirements below. As such, a 
“hot spot” will exist within the PTV centrally at the COM PTV. 
 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 19 of 37 
 For purposes of dose planning and calculation of monitor units for 
actual treatment, all tissues within the body, including l ung, will be 
corrected for tissue heterogeneity.  
 
Successful treatment planning will require accomplishment of 
all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Normalization  – The treatment plan should be normalized such 
that 100% corresponds to the center of mass of the PTV 
(COM PTV). This point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_424430] (but is not 
required to correspond) to the isocenter of the treatment beams.  
 
2. Prescription Isodose Su rface Coverage  – The prescription 
isodose surface will be chosen such that 95% of the target 
volume (PTV) is conformally covered by [CONTACT_718879] (i.e., 9 Gy per fraction x 5 fractions = 45 Gy  
total), and 99% of the target volume (PTV) receives a minimum 
of 90% of the prescription dose (i.e., 8.1 Gy per fraction = 40.5 
Gy total).  
 
3. Target Dose Heterogeneity  – The prescription isodose surface 
selected in number 2 (above) must be ≥ 60% of the dose  at the 
center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV) and ≤ 90% of the dose at 
the center of mass of the PTV (COM PTV). The COM PTV 
corresponds to the normalization point (100%) of the plan as 
noted in 1) above.  
 
4. High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]  
a. Location - Any dose greater than 105%  of the prescription 
dose (i.e., > 9.45 Gy per fraction = 47.25 Gy total for dose 
level 1) should occur primarily within the PTV itself and not 
within the normal tissues outside of the PTV. Therefore, the 
cumulative volume of all tissue outside of the PTV receiving 
a dose greater than 105% of prescription dose (>9.45 Gy per 
fraction = 47.25 Gy total) should be no more than 15% of the 
PTV volume.  
b. Volume - Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such 
that the ratio of the volume of the prescription isodos e 
meeting criteria 1) through 4) to the volume of the PTV is 
ideally < 1.2 (See table below). These criteria will not be 
required to be met in treating very small tumors (< 2.5 cm 
axial GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV 
dimension) where the requir ed minimum field size of 3.5 cm 
(see Section 5.4.2) results in the inability to meet a 
conformality ratio of 1.2.  
 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981122] be rapid in all 
directions and meet the following criteria:  
a. Location - The maximum total dose over all 5 fractions in 
Gray (Gy) to any point [ADDRESS_981123] from the PTV in 
any direction be no greater than D 2cm where D 2cm is given 
by [CONTACT_30557].  
b. Volume - The ratio of the volume of 50% of the prescription 
dose (4.5Gy per fraction = 22.5 Gy total) isodose to the 
volume of the PTV must be no greater than R 50% where 
R50% is given by [CONTACT_30557].

 6.2.6  Whole Lung   
 
Both the right and left lungs should be contoured as one structure. 
Contouring should be carried out using pulmonary windows. All 
inflated and collapsed lung should be cont oured.  However, gross

8.1 Dosimetry Compliance  
 
Exceeding the critical organ dose limits by [CONTACT_726] 2.5% constitutes a 
minor protocol violation. Exceedi ng these dose limits by [CONTACT_726] 5% 
constitutes a major protocol violation.  
 
8.2 Treatment Delivery Compliance  
 
Set-up films will be compared to digitally reconstructed radiographs from 
the same beam’s eye view. Deviations of less than 0.[ADDRESS_981129] will be considered minor protocol 
deviations. Deviations greater than those listed as m inor will be 
considered major protocol deviations.  
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 23 of 37 
  
 
9.0 RADIATION TOXICITY  
 
9.1 Radiation Pneumonitis  
 
Radiation pneumonitis is a subacute (weeks to months from treatment) 
inflammation of the end bronchioles and alveoli. The infiltrate on chest x -
ray should inclu de the area treated to high dose, but may extend outside 
of these regions. The infiltrates may be characteristically “geometric” 
corresponding to the radiation portal, but may also be ill defined. Patients 
reporting symptoms as above will be promptly evalu ated and treated. Mild 
radiation pneumonitis may be treated with non -steroidal anti -inflammatory 
agents or steroid inhalers. More significant pneumonitis will be treated with 
systemic steroids, bronchodilators, and pulmonary toilet. Supra - and 
concurrent i nfections should be treated with antibiotics. Consideration of 
prophylaxis of opportunistic infections should be considered in 
immunocompromised patients.  It is unlikely that symptomatic pneumonitis 
will occur during the weeks radiation is actually delive red to the patients. 
However, if a patient experiences pneumonitis prior to completing therapy, 
therapy should be put on hold until symptoms resolve. At that point, a 
clinical decision whether to finish therapy will be made by [CONTACT_30780].  
 
9.2 Bronchial Injury  
 
In the Indiana University phase I study published by [CONTACT_718880]., the majority of patients treated at doses of 
20 Gy times 3 fractions = 60 Gy or higher ultimately experienced 
atelectasis (collapse) of lung downstream from the area of treatment. This 
was felt to be related to injury of bronchi or bronchioles within or near the 
treated tumor. By [CONTACT_718881] a period of [ADDRESS_981130] similar imaging 
characteristics, radiology reports will often describe the overall pro cess as 
progressive disease while the actual tumor may be stable or shrinking. 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981131] parameters, pleural effusion or 
pleuritic pain (associated with coll apse), should all be graded according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 3.0).

12.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION  
 
12.1 Baseline documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions  
 
Patients enrolled to this protocol should have clinical stage I (T1 or T2, N0, 
M0) non -small cell lung cancer. At time of treatment, they should only 
have one site of gross disease i n the lung with no metastases. The 
primary lung tumor should be identified as the target lesion and recorded 
and measured at baseline and with each follow -up imaging evaluation. 
The longest diameter (LD) for the target lesion will be calculated from the 
treatment planning CT scan using pulmonary windowing and reported 
as the baseline LD. The baseline LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_718884]. For follow -up assessment, diagnostic CT 
scans performed using a [ADDRESS_981140] x -ray determination will be allowed as long as the 
target lesion is clearly visible. Changes in serum tumor markers will not be 
allowed for assessment of either local tumor progression or metastatic 
progression.  
 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/[ADDRESS_981141], an FDG -PET scan may be used to determine the clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_718858].  The FDG -PET should be interpreted with the 
original diagnostic FDG -PET.  Lesions with a high suspi[INVESTIGATOR_718859].  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) that appear after treatment (e.g., 
regional lymph nodes and distant metastases) should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at the point of their 
appearance and with each follow up. Non -target lesions should constitute 
measurable disease, which by [CONTACT_718885][INVESTIGATOR_718860] a dimension of at least 1.0 cm. 
Assessment of regional lymphatic or metastatic progression will be made 
in comparison to the required pretreatment stag ing studies or any other 
pretreatment imaging evaluations available. Only non -target lesions

13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
 
 
13.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
Adverse events grade 2 or above will be tracked as described below; 
grade 1 events will not be collected.  
 
Definition:   any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject 
including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.  
 
Grading:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 
will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 3.0 
can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/
ctcaev3.pdf ).  
 
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness and Seriousness:   the 
definitions for the terms listed that should be used are those provided by 
[CONTACT_9092]’ Office of Human 
Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on 
OHRP’s website: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/AdvEvntGuid.htm . 
 
13.2 Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
 
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population 
being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
• Suggest that the research places participants or others at a greater risk 
of harm (including physical, psycholo gical, economic, or social harm) 
than was previously known or recognized.  
 
13.3 Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional 
policies that govern human subjects research or failure to follow the 
determinations of the I RB.  Noncompliance may occur due to lack of

substantial harm to subjects or others, or that materially, compromises the 
rights or welfare of participants.  
  
13.5 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) 
and the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(QASMC):  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_718861] d to promptly notify the IRB of the following events:  
• Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others 
which occur at WU, any BJH or SLCH institution, or that impacts 
participants or the conduct of the study.  
• Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or 
determinations of the IRB.  
• Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of 
participants to participate or continue participation in the research 
study  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_981143] be collected which occur within 30 days of discontinuation 
of dosing or completion of the patient’s participation in the study if the last 
scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  
 
13.6.1  Follow Up Reports  
 
Follow up reports are only required to be submitted if the new 
information changes the original assessment or indicates, in the 
light of new information, that there is an increase d risk of harm to 
the participant or ot hers.  
 
13.7 SBRT Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All acute and late adverse events from protocol radiation therapy will be 
reported and scored.  Since the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_718862] 04/19/19  Page 29 of 37 
 treatment and follow -up for each of these patients, he is responsible for 
reporting adverse events to th e study coordinator.  NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 will be used 
to score adverse events.  A copy of the CTCAE v3.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP home page : 
 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/
ctcaev3.pdf ). 
 
For purposes of this protocol, serious adverse events related to 
stereo tactic radiation therapy include those listed as Grade [ADDRESS_981144] to scoring FEV1 and DLCO as reported on pulmonary 
function tests, an SAE will be scored relative to the % change from 
baseline.  Changes will be referenced to the baseline for a given patient 
(which will be abnormal for most p atients), using a defined proportional 
decline.  This scheme is depi[INVESTIGATOR_413209].

15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1 Statistical Methods for Phase I Portion  
 
15.1.1  Objective and Endpoint  
 
The primary objective of Phase I is to estimate the rate of acute and 
late treatment -related grade 3 or 4 toxicity (per CTCAE, v.3.0) 
related to specific symptoms, including:  
• Gastrointestinal: dysphagia, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, 
esophageal ulceration;  
• Cardiac: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiomyopathy, 
ventricular dysfunction;  
• Hemorrhage: pulmonary or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_696];  
• Pulmonary: decline in pulmonary function as measured by 
[CONTACT_83503], pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, 
hypoxemia, pleural effusion   
• Or any other grade 4 or 5 toxicity attributed  to the therapy.  
 
15.1.2  Dose Escalation Schema  
 
In order to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
radiotherapy, in terms of Gy  per fraction, that can be delivered 
using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for central lung 
tumors, acceptable morbidity criteria must be defined. Since some 
of toxicities in the current study are life threatening, we hope to 
control the dose li miting toxicity (DLT: defined as a Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity) rate in a relatively low level. The 
design will take a “5+3” strategy rather than the conventional “3+3” 
design (see below).  
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 32 of 37 
  
This study consists of four escalating dose level s, only one of which 
will be open for accrual at any time.  Dose Level A (9 Gy x 5 = 45 
Gy; BED = 85.5 Gy*) will open first.  Five (maximally eight) patients 
will be accrued to this dose level.  After Dose Level A is closed, 
accrual will begin to Dose Leve l B (10 Gy x 5 = 50 Gy; BED = 100 
Gy*). New dose levels cannot be opened until the preceding RT 
dose is deemed to be acceptable. At a given dose level, after [ADDRESS_981146] to treatment morbidity. Dose escalation will be determined 
as follows:  
• If there are no acute dose limiting toxicities (DLTs: defined as a 
grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic toxicities) in the first 5 patients 
(0/5), t hen the current dose will be deemed to be acceptable 
and will be escalated.  
• If there is [ADDRESS_981147] 5 patients (1/5), then 
an additional 3 patients will be recruited and followed for a 
minimum of 90 days. If there is 1 acute DLT obser ved (1/8), 
then the current dose will be deemed to be acceptable and will 
be escalated. If there are 2 or more acute DLTs observed 
(≥2/8), then the current dose will be deemed over -toxicity and 
the previous dose level will be considered as MTD for the Phas e 
II trial (the study will be terminated if Level A is the current 
dose).  
• If there are [ADDRESS_981148] 5 patients 
(≥2/5), the current dose will be considered over -toxicity and the 
previous dose level will be considered as MTD for  the Phase II 
trial (the study will be terminated if Level A is the current dose).  
• However, the final decision for MTD will be based on a cohort of 
8 patients and no re -escalation will be considered after “step -
down” to the previous dosage level.  
• If at an y time a grade 5 toxicity (death) is observed, accrual will 
be suspended and the event will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9532].  
• This study is designed with 4 possible SBRT dose levels.  If the 
4th dose level is achieved, then the maximum sample size for 
this study is 32 patients.  Nominally, such a “5+3” design will 
control the DLT around 12.5% level.  
• After completing accrual to dose levels 2 and 3 (during the 3 
month assessment window) accrual to t he trial may continue at 
the previous ‘safe’ dose level.  For example, if dose level 1 
proves safe, patients can be accrued and treated at dose level 1 
during the 3 month window of toxicity assessment between 
dose levels 2 and 3.

15.2 Statistical Methods for Phase II Portion  
 
15.2.1  Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint of Phase II is to estimate the local control rate 
at two years and the secondary endpoint of Phase II include the 
rates of local recurrence, regional recurrence, disease -free and 
overall survival at two years.  
 
15.2.2  Study Design  
 
This phase II study aims to improve the two -year local control rate 
from 60% to 80% , assuming that a control rate less than 60% is not 
of interest and that a 2 -year control rate of 80% or more would 
definitely be of interest. Based on Fleming’s single -stage design , [ADDRESS_981149] such 
an improvement wit h 80% power and at a 2 -sided Type I error rate 
of 0.05. However, t he above sample size is a conservative estimate 
because it is based on Fisher’s exact test for binary data. In the 
final analysis for local control rate, we will use survival data analysis 
(i.e., log -rank test) where more information (i.e., the exact times to 
local failures) will be utilized . 
 
15.2.[ADDRESS_981150] limit 
estimator will be used to describe the distribution of local -failure 
free survival. The median time to local -failure and its 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated. The Kaplan -Meier product 
limit estimator will also be used to graphically describe progression 
free survival, overall survival as well as regional nodal recurrence -
free survival. The proportion of patients who respond (completely or 
partially) will also be estimated and the correspond ing 95% 
confidence intervals will be computed.  
 
 
Protocol Version date 04/19/19  Page 34 of 37 
 15.3 Monitoring the Study for Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_718865], defined 
as acute (within 90 days of the start of treatment) or late (more than 90 
days from the start of treatment) grade 3 or 4 toxicity (per CTCAE, v.3.0) 
related to specific symptoms as detailed in Section 1 6.1 or any grade 4 or 
5 toxicity attributed to the therapy. If a patient has more than one 
unacceptable toxicity, they will only be counted as one unacceptable 
toxicity for this analysis.   
 
By [CONTACT_105453] a toxicity rate of 10% or less is acceptable and that a 
toxicity rate of 20% or more would definitely be unacceptable. Based on 
the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) with 80% power and 0.[ADDRESS_981151] (43th) patient has 
completed the trial.  If a grade 5 toxicity (death) is obser ved at any time, 
accrual will be suspended and the event will be reviewed by [CONTACT_718886].  
 
15.[ADDRESS_981152] 95% confidence that t he “true” local control rate is no larger than 
82%. Note that in the phase II setting, a trial usually will be stopped only 
because of futility. This trial will be continued even an overwhelming 
efficacy is observed in the interim analysis, and thus to hav e a more 
reliable estimation for the true treatment efficacy.

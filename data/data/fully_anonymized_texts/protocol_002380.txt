 6 1.0 Introduction : 
1.1 Background:  
Each year, more than 100,000 patients in the U.S. develop bone metastasis from spread of their 
primary cancer  [1].  Bone is the third most common site of metastat ic disease after liver and 
lung.  While all bones can be affected, the most common  site of disease spread is the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  
Complications from this metastatic spread include bone pain, pathologic fracture, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_424386] .  The incidence of bone 
metastasis is expected to increase  over the next decade as patient survival improves due to 
advances in anticancer therapy [2].  This will make the treatment of this problem more important 
in the overall management of the surviving cancer patient.  
 
1.2 Stereotactic Radiation  Thera py: 
‘Stereotactic radiosurgery’ generally refers to a radiotherapy procedure design ed to treat deep -
seated brain tumors or abnormalities, and is commonly performed on a specialized machine, 
such as the Gamma Knife.  This pro cedure involves immobilizing the patient (cranial halo), 
affixing a stable 3 -D coordinate system ( fiducial box and head frame), performing high 
resolution imaging (CT or MRI), registering the images to the coordinate system using a 
computer, virtually simu lating delivery of very focal and conformal dose profiles of radiation 
with steep dose gradients toward normal tissue, and finally carrying out the treatment with sub -
millimeter accuracy.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_424387] (15 -40 Gy) are given in a si ngle 
treatment with this technique.  Any adjacent normal tissues that receive this dose may be 
significantly damaged, thus the requirement for very conformal treatments with rapid dose fall -
off.  An alternate strategy has been to divide total radiation dos e into 2 -5 fractions, still with 
fairly large dose per fraction ( 5-10 Gy), attempting to decrease adjacent normal tissue toxicity.  
These fractionated techniques are referred to as ‘stereotactic radiotherapy,’ and are carried out 
with hope that surrounding  normal tissue will tolerate the treatment as a result of relatively more 
successful sublethal damage repair as compared to tumor.  
 
Translation of the stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy concepts to extracranial sites has 
not been straightforward [4-6].  With brain treatments, the skull serves as an excellent surface to 
rigidly couple the immobilization frame using stainless steel pi[INVESTIGATOR_424388].  Once 
the skull is immobilized, targets within the s kull are likewise immobilized in that there is very 
little movement of intracranial structures outside of fluid waves around the ventricles.  Such is 
not the case for extracranial soft tissue sites.  Inherent motion, such as the heart beating, lungs 
expand ing and emptying, and bowels churning results in movement of potential targets.  In 
addition, the external surface anatomy does not have structures amenable to rigid fixation to a 
frame.  In 1994, Lax, et al, from the Karolinska Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424389] a fiducial stereotactic coordinate s ystem 
along its side panels [6].  The system used vacuum pi[INVESTIGATOR_424390] (maximizing surface area of contact) and correlation of external anatomical reference 
points on the sternum and calf .  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_424391] 3-[ADDRESS_536524] on 
today m odern radiation treatment machines.  The vertebral bones can serve as an internal fi ducial 
for highly precise treatments.  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_424392] [7-10]. 
 
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a new therapeutic paradigm for treating localized 
tumors outside of the central nervous system and involves delivering very high doses of focused 
 7 radiation using unique beam arran gements and special  immobilization equipment [11].  As 
already demonstrated in lung and liver cancers, these treatments offer hope for improved local 
control of cancers th at may translate into gains in survival especially for smaller early stage 
lesions.  SBRT employs daily treatment doses dramatically higher than typi[INVESTIGATOR_424393] (CFRT).  In turn, it is incorrect to assume that 
SBRT  radiobiology is similar to historical CFRT.  Indeed, a unique biology of radiation response 
for very large dose per fraction treatments is being appreciated both in terms of tumor control as 
well as normal tissue consequences translating into unique clini cal outcomes.  For example, local 
control with CFRT in early stage lung cancer is consistently reported below 50% while several 
series using SBRT show local control around 90% [19, 20] . Similarly, high control rates with 
SBRT for spi[INVESTIGATOR_424394], University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_106735], and Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [14-16].  The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_424395] 500 patients treated with single fraction stereotactic 
radiotherapy for spi[INVESTIGATOR_424396] 90% and long term pain 
improvement rates of 86% [15]. 
 
The radiation dose that ca n be delivered stereotactically to vertebral body metastasis is limited by 
[CONTACT_424438].  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_424397].  Henry 
Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424398] 49 patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_424399] a dose escalation protoco l allowing a 
maximum of 10 Gy in a single fraction to 10% of the cord defined 6mm above and below the 
vertebral body [16].  This was found to be a well tolerated and safe constraint.  A radiation dose -
response relationship for pain control has not been clearly  established.  Large radiosurgical 
experiences have been reported with improved control with higher doses regardless of histology.  
Both large series from Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424400] 20 Gy in a single fraction [15, 16].   In patients that have 
received prior radiation to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424401].  Bilsky et al. 
has reported safely giving 20 Gy separated over 4 -5 treatments [14].  This protocol will deliver 
14-[ADDRESS_536525] received prior radiation t reatment to the affected level.   
 
1.3 Vertebroplasty : 
Currently, the management of metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_424402] a combination of surgery and radiotherapy for tumor suppression, 
pain reduction , and spi[INVESTIGATOR_424403] [17]. Extensive s urgical treatment is often limited by a 
patient’s poor general condition, the multifocal nature of the disease, or the patient’s short life 
expectancy. Radiation therapy alone does not impart early spi[INVESTIGATOR_424404] y and, frequently, 
patients progress to develop further vertebral body height loss or progressive deformity [18].  
Percutaneous vertebral augmentation procedures can be effective in preventing further vertebral 
body collapse and in improving pain relief.  
 
Percutaneous Vertebroplasty (PV) is a minimally invasive fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_424405] (PMMA) 
Initially developed in [LOCATION_009] in the late 1980’s to treat aggressive vertebral angiomas, 
vertebroplasty has gained widespread acceptance worldwide [19]. In the [LOCATION_002], it is 
predominantly used to treat osteoporotic compression fractures. Percutaneous kyphoplasty is a 
modifi cation of PV. It involves the percutaneous placement of balloons into the vertebral body, 
followed by [CONTACT_424439]/deflation sequence to create a cavity prior to the cement injection. The 
PK procedure may restore VB height and reduce kyphotic  angulation  p rior to PMMA 
injection [20]. 
 8 Vertebroplasty has been shown to be effective in controlling pain secondary to compression 
fractures in over 90% of patients in prospective studies [21]. Significant improvement in quality 
of life and decreased oral analgesic usage has also been shown. Although not widely used in the 
[LOCATION_002], vertebroplasty for metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_424406] s been shown in multiple studies to 
be effective in controlling pain and improving quality of life. In one study, 97% of patients 
experienced decrease in pain within 48 hours of the procedure. In another study 73% of patients 
decreased their ora l analgesic  dose by 50% or more [22-25]. 
 
The initial complication rate of vertebroplasty in patients with metastatic disease is reported to be 
approximately  10%[23]. This i s significant ly higher that  observed when the procedure is done 
for osteoporotic compression fractures (2 -5%). This is likely secondary to increased bony 
destruction in the cancer patient. Reported complications include cement leakage into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424407], neural fora mina or paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_424408]. Notably, most cement leaks are asymptomatic 
and the long term complication rate is reported to be 1.7%. Cement leakage into the neural 
foramina can cause a painful radiculopathy which typi[INVESTIGATOR_424409] t 
patients. Extravasation into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424410]. In some 
instances surgery to decompress the neural structures was necessary. Extravasation into the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_424411] r esult in pulmonary embo lism[26]. Increased 
back pain after the procedure has also been reported and is thought to be secondary to local 
irritation from the PMMA. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_424412] a short course of non -steroidal a nti-
inflammatory medications [25].  
 
1.[ADDRESS_536526] a pain response rate of approximately 50% at one month according to RTOG 97 -14[27].  
Stereotactic radiation treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_424413] a pain response of  
approximately 80% at one month and has  shown tumor control of 88% i n the largest single 
series [15].  This improved local control could be the reason for the d urable pain responses.  
Tumor control has even  translated to improvement of neurological symptoms as  seen in the trial 
done at Hen ry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [28].  
 
The rational for stereotactic radiotherapy  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424414].  The pr imary treatment for patients with metastatic disease 
is systemic therapy.  This therapy often decreases blood counts necessitating expensive 
supportive measures.  Stereotactic radiotherapy  can spare spi[INVESTIGATOR_424415]’s blood product s are made.  This is done by [CONTACT_424440].  It 
has been shown with this method that the risk of failure in adjacent vertebral bones is less than 
5%[29].  Next  the treatment is convenient  and quick allow ing patients to come for 1 -4 treatments 
instead of 10-15 treatments.  While the patients like this , it is also to their benefit because they 
can return  to systemic therapy quicker.  Lastly, stereotactic radiation  treatment is non -invasive.  
Recovery time from stereotactic radiation treatment is short and patients are often able to 
continue with their daily routines after treatment  or the next day.  
 
Radiation  cause s osteopenia and bone  loss [30-33].  While disruption of the destructive growth 
potential of malignant spi[INVESTIGATOR_424416], this radiation 
induced osteopenia becomes counterproductive, especially with time from treatment .  
Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that fortifies bone by [CONTACT_424441] 
 [ADDRESS_536527] ereotactic radiation treatments combined with vertebroplasty 
will increase pain relief at one month to 80% compared with conventional historical controls of 
approximately 50%  in the setting of patients with no prior radiation treatments and for the group 
of patients with a history of prior radiation stereotactic radiation combined with vertebroplasty 
will increase the pain relief at one month to 75% compared with conventional historical 
retreatment control of approximately 35% .  
 
1.5 Quality of Life (QOL) measurements:  
Patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_424417].  Focal treatments such as 
radiation are often used to palliate or prevent symptoms such as pain, decreased mobility, 
fracture, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377].  QOL measurements  have very important clinical 
implications since our therapy is directed at improving subjective symptoms such as pain.  
Improved understanding of patient’s symptoms and perceptions of treatment will guide what 
treatments are most advantageous in the futur e. 
 
1.5.1  Visual Analogue Scoring System (VAS):  
The VAS is a simple measure of pain in 11 scales (0 -10).  In the study comparing the 
reliability and validity of several measures of pain intensity, the composites of 0 -10 ratings 
was useful practically whe n maximal reliability is necessary in studies with relatively small 
sample sizes or in clinical settings where monitoring of changes in pain intensity in 
individuals is needed [34]. 
 
1.5.2  Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) : 
Pain originating form the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424418] a patient’s quality of life, because the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424419] -bearing area.  The BPI [CONTACT_832] a [ADDRESS_536528] item correlation (eg., for worst 
pain r = 0.93).  As these patients disease p rogresses, the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_1317] a valuable tool to 
access the general pain status.  Issues of the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_424420] [34, 35 ].  The BPI’s ease of translation and brief administration  (5 min) 
have made it a frequent used clinical tool in clinical trials where reduction or prevention of 
pain are the outcomes measured.  
 
 10 1.5.3  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT -G, version 4.0):  
The FACT -G is a commonly used tool for measuring the multidimensional components of 
health related quality of life (HRQOL) over four scales: physical well being (7 items), 
social/family well -being (7 items), emotional well being (6 items), and functional well 
being (7 items) [36].  FACT developed by [CONTACT_424442]., is a five point self rating scale (from 
“not at all” to “very much”).  Test -retest reliability is high for the subscales with correlation 
coefficients ranging from a high of .[ADDRESS_536529] has been translated into more than 25 different 
languages.  
 
1.5.4  EuroQol – 5 Dimension (EQ -5D): 
The EQ -5D is a method for obtaining evaluations of health related QOL, preference and 
utility scores to be use d as an adjustment to survival, and may be used in future cost -utility 
analysis.  It is a two -part questionnaire that takes approximately 5 minutes to complete [37].  
The first part consists of 5 dimensions including  mobility, self care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension can be graded on 3 levels 
including: 1 -no problems, 2 -moderate problems, and 3 -extreme problems.  Health states are 
defined by [CONTACT_424443] r esponses to the five dimensions, generating 243 
(35) health states to which unconsciousness and death are added [38].  The second part is a 
visual analogue scale valuing current health state measured on a [ADDRESS_536530] imaginable health state is scored as 100 at the top.  Both the five -item index 
score and the Visual a nalogue scale are transformed into a utility score between 0 “worst 
health state” and 1 “best health state”.  Either the index score or the visual analogue score 
can be used in the quality adjusted survival analysis, or enter the cost utility equation, 
depending on the health state(s) of interest [39].  Quality -adjusted survival time [U=sum of 
quality (qi) of health states K times the duration (si) spent in each health state] [40].  The 
EQ-5D has been translated into multiple languages which are available at 
http://www.euroqol.org/.  
 
2.0 Objectives : 
2.1  Primary :   To determine the efficacy of stereotactic body radiation for spi[INVESTIGATOR_424421] .  Both partial and complete response will be measured by [CONTACT_424444] (VAS).  Partial relief equals an improvement of 2 points on the VAS and complete pain response 
is defined by a score of 0 -1 on the VAS with no increase in narcotic requirement.  
 
2.2 Secondary :   
2.2.1 To determine the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) scored as the time of 
maximal pain relief to an increase of 2 on the VAS  
2.2.2 To determine the functional preservation of  improvement using the Brief Pain Inventory 
(BPI)  
 2.2.3 To prospectively assess patients quality of life (QOL) using the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer  Therapy – General (FACT -G) and patients utilities using the EuroQol (EQ -5D) 
2.2.4 To determine the long  term stability of the treated vertebral bone (such as fracture, sclerotic 
change, vertebral body height or  mal alignment) by [CONTACT_9268],  CT scan  and plain radiographs.

5.3 Accreditation  
5.3.1  Institutional Processes  
Prior to treating patients on protocol, the institution’s specific methods for 
immobi lization (e.g., frame vs. frameless), targeting, dose construction, daily verification 
of accuracy, ongoing assessment of accuracy and Quality Assurance policies must be 
described to and approved by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_424423].  The 
primary purpose of accreditation will be to insure that dose is delivered to the targets and 
avoiding normal tissues according to protocol criteria.  This accreditation may be 
assessed by [CONTACT_424445], conference calls, or direct observation via si te visits.  
Additional data may be required of institutions to verify that techniques are performing as 
intended.  
 
6.0  RADIATION THERAPY  
6.1 DOSE SPECIFICATIONS  
6.1.1  Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment  
The term “stereotactic” for the purposes of this pr otocol implies the targeting, planning, and 
directing of therapy using beams of radiation along any trajectory in [ADDRESS_536539] skin marks or bony landmarks and assumed to 
correlate to the actual tumor target based on a historical simulation.  It should be understood 
that Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) has become a treatment that is well 
beyond just stere otactic targeting.   Indeed SBRT is mostly about ablative range dose per 
fraction, accounting properly for errors including motion, careful construction of dosimetry 
that delivers high dose to the tumor and not normal tissues, and extra careful treatment 
delivery .  This protocol will require treatments to be conducted with the use of a fixed 3 -D 
coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_424446].  The coordinate system defined by [CONTACT_424447] 
 13 should be directly related to the radiation producing device (e.g., couch an d gantry) in a

within the patient according to this same [ADDRESS_536540] a target according to

6.1.3  Premedications  
Unless contraindicated, it is recommended but not required that all patients receive 
corticosteroid premedication (e.g. Decadron 4 mg p.o. in a single dose, or equivalent) 15 -60 
minutes prior to each of the five treatments for the intended purpose of modulating 
immedia te acute inflammatory effects.  Analgesic premedication to avoid general disc omfort 
during long treatment durations  is also recommended when appropriate.  
6.1.4  Supportive medicines  
Are allowed as medically indicated.  
 
6.2 Technical Factors  
6.2.1 Physical Factors  
 14 Only photon (x -ray) beams produced by [CONTACT_424448] 6 -21 MV 
will be allowed.  Cobalt -60 and charged particle beams (including electrons, protons, and 
heavier ions) are not allowed.  
6.2.2 Dose Verification at Treatment  
Personal dosimeter measurements (e.g. diode, TLD, etc.) may be obtained for surf ace dose 
verification for accessible beams as per institutional preference.  This information is not 
required by [CONTACT_760].  
 
6.3 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
6.3.1  Patient Positioning  
Patients will be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a stable positi on capable of allowing accurate 
reproducibility of the target position from treatment to treatment.  Positions uncomfortable 
for the patient should be avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled movement during treatments.  
A variety of immobilization systems ma y be utilized including stereotactic frames that 
surround the patient on three sides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients external 
contours) with reference to the stereotactic  coordinate system .  All positioning systems must 
be validated and acc redited by [CONTACT_49005] (Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_424426]) prior to enrolling or treating patients on this trial.  Patient immobilization must be 
reliable enough to insure that the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the 
confines of the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) as defined in Section 6.4 with any 
significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_536549] of internal organ motio n (i.e., 
breathing, etc.) on target positioning and reproducibility.  In some cases, the intrafractional 
tumor motion is small and no special maneuvers are required to achieve motion limits  (as is 
true with most spi[INVESTIGATOR_424427]).  Treating in the prone 
position will accentuate internal organ motion problems related to breathing and should be 
avoided unless special measures are taken to account for this motion.  When accounting for 
intrafractional motion, acceptable maneuvers  including  accelerator beam gating or tracking 
with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], and active breath -holding techniques. Internal organ inhibition 
maneuvers must be reliable enough to insure that the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) does not 
deviate beyond the confines of  the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) as defined in Section 
6.4 with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  Assessment of this motion will be left to the 
institution.  This type of interfractional motion analysis with correction is only required by 
[CONTACT_424449].  Intrafraction assessment during the course of 
each treatment (dynamic and adaptive maneuvers) is allowed and encouraged especially if 
treatment times are long.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_536550] 
prior to each treatment in the treatment position to ident ify the tumor target directly.  
Orthogonal kv or mv x-ray images (or patients should undergo a tomo graphic imaging study 
utilizing the linear accelerator couch, if available)  should  be obtained on the day of treatment 
and compared to digitally reconstructed images from simulation  to ensure proper alignment . 
 
6.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
6.4.1  Image Acquisition  
 15 Computed Tomography (CT) will be the primary image platform for targeting and treatment 
planning.  The planning CT scans must allow simultaneous view of the patient anatomy and 
fiducial system for stereotactic targeting.  Treatment plannin g images should be performed in 
the treatment position using all aids/maneuvers described above.  Axial acquisitions with 
gantry 0 degrees w ill be required with spacing ≤ [ADDRESS_536551] lines, disc, or tape.  
 
Image fusion with other imaging modalities such as MRI that might be useful in delineating 
the target and  normal tissues is encouraged.   MRI is to be done in the treatment position to 
allow for precise fusion.  
 
6.4.2  Target Volumes  
The GTV (gross tumor volume) will be defined as gross tumor visualized on CT/MRI scan in 
the vertebral body, para -spi[INVESTIGATOR_424428] , or in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470].  The CTV  (clinical target 
volume)  will include the GTV and contiguous bone marrow cavity adjacent to the tumor .  
The posterior elements of the vertebra will be included  in the CTV only when directly 
involved by [CONTACT_424450] .  GTV and  CTV target volume will be outlined by [CONTACT_424451].  The target will generally be drawn using CT soft tissue /bone  windows  and 
from fused MRI.  Since the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424429].  That is , the CTV will also be the PTV (planned target 
volume).     
6.4.3  Dosimetry  
Three -dimensional coplanar or non -coplanar beam, arc rotation, or Intensity Modulated 
Radiotherapy (IMRT) beam arrangements will be custom designed for eac h case to deliver 
highly conformal prescription dose distributions.  Non -opposing, non -coplanar beams are 
preferable.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 10 -15 beams of radiation will be used with roughly equal weighting  
for conventional linac treatments .  When static beams are u sed, a minimum of 10 non -
opposing beams should be used.  For arc rotation techniques, a minimum of 300 degrees 
(cumulative for all beams) should be utilized.  For CyberKnife treatments many more beams 
may be u tilized depending on the size and  the location.   For this protocol, the isocenter is 
defined as the common point of gantry and couch rotation for the treatment unit. Field 
aperture size and shape should correspond nearly identically to the projection of the PTV 
along a beam’s eye view (i.e. no addition al “margin” for dose build up at the edges of the 
blocks or MLC jaws beyond the PTV).  As such, prescription lines covering the PTV will 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 70 -90% line (rather than 95 -100%); however, higher isodoses (hotspots) 
must be manipulated to occur wi thin the target and not in adjacent normal tissue.  The 
isocenter in stereotactic coordinates will be determined from system fiducials (or directly 
from the tumor) and translated to the treatment record.  
 
The treatment dose plan will be made up of multiple  static beams or arcs as described above.  
The plan should be normalized to a defined point corresponding closely to the center of mass 
of the GTV  (COM GTV).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this point will be the isocenter of the beam rotation; 
however, it is not a protocol re quirement for this point to be the isocenter.  Regardless, the 
point identified as COM GTV must have defined stereotac tic coordinates and receive 100% of 
the normalized dose.  Because the beam apertures coincide nearly directly with the edge of 
the PTV (lit tle or no added margin), the external border of the PTV will be covered by a 
lower isodose surface than usually used in conventional radiotherapy planning, typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
around 80% but ranging from 70 -90%.  The prescription dose in  both the single fraction and  
five fr action treatments will be delivered to the margin of the GTV  and fulfill the 
 16 requirements below.  As such, a “hot spot” will exist within the GTV  centrally at the 
COM GTV with a magnitude of the prescription dose times the reciprocal of the chosen 
prescription iso dose line (i.e., 70 -90%).  
 
For purposes of dose planning and calculation of monitor units for actual treatment, all 
tissues within the body should be modeled in the planning system as to their electron density.  
Proper heterogeneity correcti on algorithms should be approved by [CONTACT_978].  
  
Successful treatment planning will require accomplishment of all of the following criteria:  
1) Normalization   
The treatment plan should be normalized such that 100% corresponds to the 
center of mass of the GTV (CO MGTV).  This point will typi[INVESTIGATOR_424430] 
(but is not required to correspond) to the isocenter of the treatment beams.  
2) Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage  
The prescription isodose surface will be chosen such that ≥95% of the target 
volume (PTV) is covered by [CONTACT_424452]  (see 
section 6.1.2)  and 99% of the target volume (PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of 
the minimum prescription dose.   However, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_424431] 
6.[ADDRESS_536552] tolerance with a potential protocol violation for target coverage.  
3) Target Dose H eterogeneity  
The prescrip tion isodose surface selected in number 2 (above) must be ≥ 60% of 
the dose at the center of mass of the GTV (COM GTV) and ≤ 90% of the dose at the 
center of mass of the GTV (COM GTV). The COM GTV corresponds to the 
normalization point (100%) of the plan as n oted in 1) above.  
4) High Dose Spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]  
a. Location  
Any dose greater than 105% of the prescription dose should occur primarily 
within the PTV itself and not within the normal tissues outside of the PTV.  
Therefore, the cumulative volume of all tissue outsi de of the PTV receiving a 
dose greater than 105% of prescription dose should be no more than 15% of 
the PTV volume.  Ideally, these hot spots will be manipulated to occur within 
the gross tumor volume.  IMRT and other techniques will be encouraged to 
accom plish this goal.  
b. Volume  
Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such that the ratio of the 
volume of the prescription isodose meeting criteria 1) through 4) to the 
volume of the PTV is less than 1.3.  
 
6.5 Critical Structures  
6.5.1  Critical Organ Do se-Volume Limits  
The following table s lists maximum dose limits to a point or volume within several critical 
organs.  These are absolute limits, and dose that exceeds these limits by 5% will constitute a 
major protocol violation . 
 
These limits were formula ted with the approval of the study committee using known 
tolerance data, radiobiological conversion models, norms used in current practice at 
academic centers.  Participating centers are encouraged to observe prudent treatment

0.3-0.5 cm will be considered minor protocol devi ations.  Deviations greater than those 
listed as minor will be considered major protocol deviations.  
6.8.4  Target Coverage Compliance  
As listed in sections 6.1.2 and 6.4.3, the protocol requires that 95% of the PTV volume be 
given the protocol dose while 9 9% of the PTV volume should get 90% of the prescribed 
dose.  A minor violation would be issued for PTV prescription dose coverage of 90 -95% 
while and a major violation for <90%.  A minor violation will be issued if between 95 -99% 
of the target volume recei ves 90% of the prescribed dose, while a major violation for <95% 
of the volume.  In regard to the GTV coverage, a minor violation will be issued for 
coverage of 85 -90% of the volume by [CONTACT_247374], while a major violation for 
<85% of the volume.

13.0 Statistical Consideration : 
13.1  Single Fraction Treatment Group  
Two -Stage Design and Sample Size Justification  
The planned sample size of 29 total eligible subjects is based on Simon two -stage optimal design 
with an overall significance level of 0.05 and power of 90% (Simon R, 1989).  The concept of this 
design is to permit early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_143395] a moderately long sequence of initial failure occurs. The 
historical response rate to conventional radiation treatments is 50%[27].  This response rate comes 
from the RTOG [ADDRESS_536572] of care for 
 26 palliation of pain bone metastasis in previously unirradiated patients and thus is used as the 
historical control for this group.  The statistical hypothesis tested is as follows:  
 
H0: p≤50% vs. H A: p≥80%, where p is one month pain response rat e 
 
Rejection of H [ADDRESS_536573] 6 of 9 eligible subjects respond, an 
additional 20 subjects will be enrolled into stage 2 of the study. If the total number of patients who 
respond (among the 29 patients) is 19 or more, the null hypothesis above will be rejected in favor 
of the alternate hypothesis.  
 
Under the null hypothesis (p≤50%), the expected sample size of the trial is only 14.  
 
The assumptions and specifications for Simon’s two -stage desig n are detailed in the following

13.2  Five Fraction Treatment Grou p 
Two -Stage Design and Sample Size Justification  
The planned sample size of 13 total eligible subjects is based on Simon two -stage optimal design 
with an overall significance level of 0.05 and power of 90% (Simon R, 1989).  The concept of this 
design is t o permit early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_143395] a moderately long sequence of initial failure occurs. The 
historical response rate to conventional radiation treatments is 35% [42].  This response rate comes 
from a subsequent analysis o f the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study which looked at 800 cGy in one 
fraction vs 2400 cGy in multiple fractions.  It represents combined complete and partial responses.  
This analysis details what the response rate to conventional radiation retreatment in the setting of 
prior irradiation to the treated area and thus is used as the historical control for this group.  The 
statistical hypothesis tested is as follows:  
 
H0: p≤35% vs. H A: p≥75%, where p is response rate  
 [ADDRESS_536576] 3 of 6 eligible subjects respond, 
additional 7 subjects will be enrolled into stage 2 of the study. If the total number of patients who 
respond (among the 13 patients) is 8 or more, the null hypothesis above wil l be rejected in favor of 
the alternate hypothesis.  
 
Under the null hypothesis (p≤35%), the expected sample size of the trial is only 9.  
 
The assumptions and specifications for Simon’s two -stage design are detailed in the following

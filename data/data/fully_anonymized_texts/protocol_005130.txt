 Cochlear Implantation in Adults with Asymmetric Hearing Loss  
Clinical Trial  
Protocol  
Introduction  
The advantages of binaural hearing (listening with two ears) over monaural hearing 
(listening with one ear) have been well documented and include sound localization, 
speech understanding in noise, judgments of distance and movement, and detection of 
soft o r distant speech (Cochran et al., 1968 ; Durlach and C olburn, 1978 ; Grantham, 
1986 ; Bronkhorst and Plomp, 1988 , 1989 ; Akeroyd, 2006 ; Colburn et al., 2006 ).  These 
advantages are achieved by [CONTACT_750496].  Because ears are spatially separated, the sound received at each ear differs in 
both time and amplitude information.  For example, whether localizing a sound or 
listening in noise, one ear is typi[INVESTIGATOR_750476] r, with the head 
acting as a barrier between the ears.  Consequently, the signal arrives at the near ear 
before the far ear, creating discrepancies in arrival time referred to as interaural time 
differences (ITDs).  Furthermore, because the head impedes th e sound, the signal has 
greater amplitude at the near ear compared to the far ear, which results in loudness 
differences between the ears referred to as interaural level differences (ILDs).  All 
audible sounds generate both ITDs and ILDs that are crucial f or central processing of 
auditory information.  The ability to reconcile these differences with great precision 
enables binaural listeners to localize sound and understand speech in background noise 
with little effort.  Having input to both ears also provi des a redundant signal to the 
auditory system, which is important for understanding soft speech and hearing distant 
sounds (Levitt and Rabiner, 1967a , b; Morera et al., 2005 ; Morera et al., 2012 ).  Studies 
utilizing self -assessment questionnaires have confirmed that monaural l isteners perceive 
deficits in everyday communication for understanding soft speech and speech in noise 
as well as for spatial hearing.  Moreover, studies have identified secondary effects of 
hearing loss such as fatigue, increased effort, anxiety and socia l isolation (Hétu et al., 
1988 ; Ringdahl and Grimby, 2000 ; Hicks and Tharpe, 2002 ; McCoy et al., 2005 ; 
Nachtegaal et al., 2009 ).  The degradation or complete loss of binaural  abilities can have 
a significant impact on daily communication and overall quality of life.   
Individuals with asymmetric hearing, that is, one ear with moderate hearing loss and one 
ear with severe to profound hearing loss (SPHL), lack binaural input and  are thus unable 
to attain binaural hearing advantages.  Clinically, attempts to fit amplification in the poor 
ear with SPHL are problematic due to the severity of the hearing loss and the limitations 
of hearing aid (HA) technology, which result in insuffi cient gain and reduced sound 
quality.  Patients often discontinue amplification in this ear due to lack of perceived 
benefit and are consequently rendered monaural listeners (Kochkin, 2010 ; Kaplan -
Neeman et al., 2012 ).  Interestingly, Noble and Gatehouse (2004 ) reported that patients 
with asymmetric hearing were significantly more disabled than those with symmetric 
hearing loss for speech recognition, spatial hearing and quality of sound.  
A treatment option for individuals with asymmetr ic hearing loss is a bilateral contralateral 
routing of the signal HA (BiCROS) (Oeding and Valente, 2013 ).  This system consists of 
a transmitter worn on the poor ear that pi[INVESTIGATOR_750477] a microphone and a HA 
with an integrated receiver that is worn on the better ear.  The HA provides amplification 
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page [ADDRESS_1027488] by [CONTACT_750497].  New technology, such as improve d digital 
signal processing and noise reduction circuitry, has been implemented in current 
BiCROS HAs in hopes of improving performance; these features were preferred by 
[CONTACT_750498] (Williams et al., 2012 ; Oeding and 
Valente, 2013 ).  However, test measures, specifically testing in noise, did not show a 
significant difference in performance between newer and older BiCROS technology.  In 
fact, Oeding and Valente (2013 ) found no difference between the unaided test condition 
and three BiCROS test conditions (no noise reduction circuitry, mild noise reduction, and 
maximum noise reduction).  Williams et al. (2012 ) also reported no statistically significant 
improv ement when testing in noise with newer versus older BiCROS technology.  
Furthermore, group mean scores in noise were no different when participants were 
tested with just a HA on the better ear (nothing on poor ear) versus the full BiCROS 
system.  These res ults were consistent regardless of the technology used (i.e., new or 
older).  A significant limitation of the BiCROS HA is that it does not provide binaural 
input.  As a result, individuals fit with a BiCROS are unable to take advantage of ITDs 
and ILDs, w hich are necessary for binaural processing to improve speech understanding 
in noise.  As noted above, ITDs and ILDs are also necessary for sound localization.  The 
research in this area (BiCROS and sound localization) is sparse; however, Arndt et al. 
(2011 ) evaluated localization abilities o f 11 individuals who had worn a contralateral 
routing of the signal (CROS) device for three weeks.  These individuals had one ear with 
SPHL and one ear with normal hearing.  Like the BiCROS system, the CROS device 
routes the signal from the poor hearing si de to the good hearing side but does not 
provide amplification to the better (normal hearing) ear.  Results of the Arndt study 
revealed no difference in sound localization ability between the CROS device and no 
device conditions.  Therefore, it is unlikely  that a BiCROS HA would be beneficial in 
localizing sound.  Again, because the BiCROS and CROS systems do not restore 
hearing to the poor ear, individuals using this technology do not receive binaural cues, 
such as ILDs or ITDs and consequently, cannot ach ieve advantages derived from 
binaural hearing.     
The treatment option most typi[INVESTIGATOR_750478] 
a HA fitted to the better ear only and no HA in the poorer ear.  As stated above, fitting a 
HA to an ear with a SPHL  and poor word recognition is generally unsuccessful and 
therefore not routinely done for individuals with a better hearing ear.  Insufficient gain, 
poor sound quality, and lack of perceived benefit when the poor ear is aided are 
common concerns.  Addition ally, it is often assumed that these individuals can function 
sufficiently well with conventional amplification in the better ear alone.  A weakness of 
this assumption is that fitting of amplification in one ear does not allow ITD or ILD 
comparisons and al l binaural processes are lost.  Therefore, optimized auditory function 
for real -life listening in conditions of noise, reverberation, speaker variation and distance 
is virtually eliminated.  
Adult cochlear implant (CI) candidates typi[INVESTIGATOR_750479].  In these cases, one ear or both ears may be 
implanted.  In cases of bilateral implantation, many studies have shown the feasibility of 
integrating signals from both ears, providing bilateral CI rec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_750480], 
better understanding of soft speech and improved localization compared to a unilateral 
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 8 
 CI (Litovsky et al., 2006 ; Buss et al., 2008 ; Dunn et al., 2012 ; Reeder et al., 2014 ).  A 
number of studies have also examined effects of bimodal input, listening with a CI in one 
ear and a HA in the other, in comparison to a  unilateral CI alone (Tyler et al., 2002 ; 
Morera et al., 2005 ; Ching et al., 2007 ; Potts et al., 2009 ; Morera et al., 2012 ).  
Participants in these studies had very little residual hearing in the non -implanted ear; the 
majority had moderately -severe -to-profound or severe -to-profound hearing loss in the 
non-implanted ear.  Even so,  the results revealed improved speech understanding in 
noise, improved speech understanding in quiet at both conversational and soft listening 
levels, and improved localization abilities in the bimodal listening condition (CI + HA) 
compared to the CI alone  listening condition.  In addition, participants preferred the 
combined input from a CI in one ear and a HA in the other, and showed higher ratings 
compared to either the CI or HA alone conditions on self -assessment questionnaires that 
probe communication functioning in everyday situations (Potts et al., 2009 ; Dwyer et al., 
2014 ). 
Recent studies at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have 
investigated the effects of asymmetric hearing loss and the possibility of restoring 
binaural abilities through coc hlear implantation.  Study participants had at least a 
moderate -to-profound hearing loss in one ear (that received a CI) but less hearing loss 
in the opposite ear (that continued HA use).  Initial results from 10 participants indicated 
the CI successfully restored hearing to the poor ear by [CONTACT_750499].  In general, CI sound field threshold levels from 250 -6000 Hz were 30 
dB HL or better (Firszt et al., 2012).  Adults with postlingual hearing loss demonstrated 
significant open -set speech recognition in the implanted ear at the six month test interval 
for measures in quiet and noise (Firszt et al., 2011 ; Firszt et al., 2012 ).  In addition to 
improved audibility and speech recognition with the implant in the poor hearing ear, 
study participants demonstrated significantly improved speech r ecognition and 
localization when comparing the six -month bimodal condition (CI + HA) to the pre -
implant, everyday listening condition (HA in the better ear alone) (Firszt et al., 2012 ).  
For sentences presente d at a soft level in quiet and for localization, scores at the six -
month test interval were significantly better in the bimodal condition than the HA in the 
better ear alone condition.  Furthermore, the improvements seen between pre - and post -
implant test conditions were supported by [CONTACT_750500], Spatial and 
Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ), (Firszt et al., 2012 ; Dwyer et al., 2014 ).   
In summary, many hearing -impaired patients fu nction with noticeable hearing 
asymmetry.  When hearing is asymmetric and the loss in the poor ear is moderate -to-
profound, lack of treatment for that ear is very common, which results in monaural 
hearing.  Listening with just one ear, particularly a heari ng-impaired ear, is detrimental to 
signal segregation and communication.  Individuals with asymmetric hearing loss 
frequently seek medical care due to pervasive communication difficulties.  The only 
available treatment that can provide hearing to the deaf ear is a CI.  At this time, 
individuals with asymmetric hearing loss are not routinely implanted in the poor hearing 
ear simply because the contralateral, better hearing ear has hearing loss in the 
moderate range rather than the severe to profound range.  A prospective, single -arm, 
multi -center clinical trial is critically needed to address the deficits of patients with 
asymmetric hearing loss and explore potential treatment with a CI.  Outcomes from this 
study will also inform a future pi[INVESTIGATOR_750481].

 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective :  Obtain preliminary efficacy data in adults with asymmetric hearing 
loss who receive a cochlear implant (CI) in the poor hearing ear and maintain a hearing 
aid (HA) in the better hearing ear.  Efficacy is defined  as post -implant improvement in 
the poor ear with a CI compared to pre -implant with a HA.  Measures are sound field 
threshold levels and CNC monosyllabic words in quiet.  
Secondary Objectives :   
1. Obtain efficacy data related to bimodal hearing.  Efficacy is defined as post -implant 
improvement (CI in poor ear + HA in better ear) compared to the pre -implant best -
aided condition (either HAs in both ears, or a HA in the better ear alone for adults 
with no aidable hearing in the poor ear).  Measures are sound localization, speech 
recognition in noise, speech recognition at soft presentation levels, perceived 
hearing handicap, and reported quality of life.   
2. Evaluate safety associated with cochlear implan tation in individuals with asymmetric 
hearing loss.  The safety evaluation will be based on the number, type and degree of 
all adverse events.  
3. Collect essential preliminary information related to test measures and methodology 
that can be used clinically in  a future Phase III clinical trial (e.g., localization, listening 
in noise, listening at soft levels).   
Study Design  
The study will be conducted as a multicenter, prospective, single -arm clinical trial, 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of cochlear impla ntation in patients with asymmetric 
hearing loss.  A repeated -measures analysis will be employed whereby [CONTACT_750501].  Thirty -seven individuals with asymmetric hearing loss will 
participate at three to four investigational sites .  Participants will be recruited from 
surgeons and audiologists in Otolaryngology departments at the participating sites.  Prior 
to receiving a CI in the poor hearing ear, participants will be evaluated as follows:  
• HA in the better ear alone  
• HA in the po or ear alone  
• Bilateral HAs  
Post-implant evaluations will occur at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial stimulation of 
the CI.  Participants will be evaluated as follows:  
• HA in the better ear alone  
• CI in the poor ear alone  
• HA and CI together  
The study lengt h for individual participants will be approximately [ADDRESS_1027489] approximately 5 years.  
These study results are essential for the development of a Phase III multi -center clinical 
trial, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_750482]/exclu sion criteria, test protocols, pre -implant baseline 
condition(s), and final sample size estimates.

Investigation Procedures  
Test Measures  
All testi ng will take place in a sound booth using calibrated equipment and test stimuli.   
Unaided Audiometric Threshold Levels  
Air and bone conduction audiometric threshold levels in dB HL will be obtained for both 
ears using standard audiometric test procedures (Carhart and Jerger, 1959 ).   
Air conduction threshold levels, using insert earphones, will be obtained at 250, 500, 
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 Hz.  When necessary, narrow band n oise will 
be used to mask the better hearing ear.   
Bone conduction threshold levels will be obtained at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 
4000 Hz.  When necessary, narrow band noise will be used to mask the better hearing 
ear.   
Aided FM, Tone Sound Field Th reshold Levels  
Sound field threshold levels will be obtained in the sound booth using frequency 
modulated (FM) tones presented through a loudspeaker situated at ear level at 0° 
azimuth.  The loudspeaker will be located 1.5 meters from the center of the par ticipant’s 
head.  Sound field levels will be obtained in dB HL at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 
and 6000 Hz.  Levels will be obtained at each frequency in 2 dB steps using the 
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 12 
 Hughson -Westlake procedure (Carhart and Jerger, 1959 ).  Participants will be instructed 
to press the response button every time the tone is heard, even if the tone is very soft.   
Consonant -Vowel Nucleus -Consonant (CNC) Word Test  
The CNC monosyllabic word test (Peterson and Lehiste, 1962 ) is part of the Minimum 
Speech Test Battery (Luxford and Ad Hoc Subcommittee, 2001 ) for CI candidates and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The test consists of [ADDRESS_1027495].  
The words are spoken by a male talker; each word is preceded by [CONTACT_21440] “ready.”   
CNC word testing will be administered in the sound field through a loudspeaker at ear 
level at 0° azimuth and 1.5 meters from the center of the participant’s head.  The test will 
be presented at [ADDRESS_1027496] and will be encouraged to guess when possible.  The tester will write down the 
participant’s response and words will be scored as a percent correct.   
AzBio Sentence Test  
The AzBio Sentence Test (Spahr et al., 2012 ) consists of [ADDRESS_1027497] Battery for Adult Cochlear Implant 
Users.  AzBio sentences are spoken by [CONTACT_750502], two males and two females; each 
talker presents five of the 20 sentences.  The sentences are spoken in a conversational 
style, are 4 -10 words in length, and approxim ate a fourth grade reading level (King et al., 
2012 ).   
The sentences will be presented in the sound field through a loudspeaker (0° azimuth, 
1.5 meters from center of participant’s head) at [ADDRESS_1027498] in 4 -talker babble noise using a +8 dB signal -to-noise ratio (SNR).  When sentences 
are presented in 4 -talker babble noise, sentences and noise will be presented through 
the same loudspeaker (0° azimuth).  The participant will repeat as much of the se ntence 
as possible.  The test will be scored as percent correct.  
Bamford -Kowal -Bench Speech -in-Noise (BKB -SIN) Test  
The BKB -SIN Test (Etymotic Research, 2005 ) will be administered in the sound field at 
[ADDRESS_1027499] with sentences presented from the front loudspeaker (0° azimuth) and 4 -
talker babble noise presented from a loudspeaker 90° t o the participant’s right and 90° to 
the participant’s left.  The BKB -SIN Test includes [ADDRESS_1027500] grade 
reading level.  The 4 -talker babble begins at a  +[ADDRESS_1027501] sentence and 
decreases by 3 dB after each sentence in order to obtain an SNR -50 score; that is, an 
SNR for which 50% of the key words are repeated by [CONTACT_2299].  The BKB -SIN Test 
is part of the New Minimum Speech Test Batter y for Adult Cochlear Implant Users, 2011.   
Localization Test  
A localization test will be administered in the sound field with stimuli presented from a 
140°, eight loudspeaker array.  Loudspeakers will be spaced 20° apart.  The participant 
will sit facing the center of the array (0° azimuth).  The loudspeakers are ap proximately 
at head level and numbered [ADDRESS_1027502] with the level roved by ± [ADDRESS_1027503] is preceded by [CONTACT_21440] 
“ready,” and both are presented from the same loudspeaker.  Prior to the onset of each 
trial, participants are instructed to keep their gaze fixed at 0° azimuth until the word 
“ready” is heard, at which point they are free to turn their head if desired.  After stating 
the loudspeaker number from which they heard the word, parti cipants will reposition their 
gaze to 0° azimuth.  Eight words are presented from each of the eight loudspeakers 
(total of 64 presentations); loudspeaker order is pseudo randomized.  A root mean

 square (RMS) error score is calculated as the mean source -response difference, 
irrespective of error direction (the square root of the quotient resulting from the sum of 
each source -response difference squared and divided by [CONTACT_54313]).  A lower 
RMS error score indicates less localization error, or greate r accuracy.  Localization in 
Noise  will be evaluated using the same system and stimuli with the addition of [ADDRESS_1027504] restaurant noise originating from all loudspeakers.  
Questionnaires  
Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)  
The HHIE (Ventry and Weinstein, 1982 ) is a 25 -item, self -assessment scale that 
quantifies the perceived emotional and social/situational consequences of hearing lo ss.  
It is composed of 13 emotional subscale items and 12 social/situational subscale items.  
Each item is a question that the participant answers as “Yes”, “Sometimes” or “No”.  The 
HHIE can be used to identify changes in handicap scores following a speci fic treatment 
or over time.  
Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3)  
The HUI3 (Furlong et al., 2001 ) provi des descriptive evidence on multiple dimensions of 
health status and results in a score for each dimension of health, and a health related 
quality of life overall score.  Health dimensions include vision, hearing, speech, 
ambulation/mobility, pain, dexteri ty, self -care, emotion and cognition.  Each dimension 
has [ADDRESS_1027505] describes 
their perceived ability.  The overall scores are on the conventional scale of dead = 0.[ADDRESS_1027506] health = 1 .00.  The HUI3 has been used in numerous clinical studies 
worldwide.  The HUI3 can be used to identify current health status as well as a change 
in health status over time or as the result of a specific event or treatment.  
Speech, Spatial and Sound Qualiti es (SSQ) Questionnaire  
The SSQ (Gatehouse and Noble, 2004 ) is a self -assessment questionnaire.  The 
participant will rate their perceived hearing ability for a number of listening situations.   
The questionnaire includes a broad rang e of domains and reflects the individual’s 
perception of functioning in real -world situations.  Section I, Speech hearing, probes 
speech recognition in a variety of sound environments with varying degrees of talker 
variability.  Section II, Spatial hearing , examines three components of spatial hearing, 
sound direction, distance, and movement.  Section III, Qualities of hearing, considers 
segregation of sound, naturalness, and listening effort.   
Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)  
The Glasgow Benefit  Inventory  (Robinson and Summerfield, 1996 ) was specifically 
developed for otorhinolaryngological conditions and interventions.  The GBI is a post -
intervention questionnaire that me asures change in health status following surgical 
intervention, e.g., CI surgery.  The GBI was designed to be patient -oriented, maximally 
sensitive to otorhinolaryngological interventions, and provide a common metric to 
compare benefit across different int erventions.  The questionnaire has 18 items and 
employs a five -point Likert scale that ranges from much better to much worse.  
Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL)  
The SADL (Uriate et al, 2005) probes patient satisfaction with hearing aids;  wording is 
modified for bimodal listeners. The participant will rate satisfaction for [ADDRESS_1027507], use, and communication.  The participants rate their 
satisfaction along a 7 -point scale from “Not at all” to “Tremendous ly”. 
Participant Interview Form  
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 14 
 This form guides investi gators as they query participants about tinnitus, dizziness, 
medications, and the incision/implant site (post -implant only).  The form will be used pre - 
and post -implant and will assist investigators in the identification of adverse events.  
The Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired (CPHI) – Communication 
Performance  
The CPHI (Demorest and Erdman, 1987) Communication Performance section is 18 
questions focused on situations the participant exp eriences at home, work and in social 
situations.  The spouse/significant other will complete regarding the participant’s 
communication abilities.  Each question is answered along a 5 -point scale from “Rarely, 
Almost Never” to “Usually, Almost Always”.    
The Hearing Impaired Impact – Significant Other Profile (HII -SOP)  
The HII -SOP (Preminger and Meeks, 2010) is designed for the spouse/significant other; 
and addresses the impact of hearing loss on the spouse/significant other (rather than on 
the participant ).  It is comprised of [ADDRESS_1027508].  The 
spouse/significant other answers Yes, Sometimes, or No to each question.  
Study Schedule  
A summary of the pre -implant and post -implant study test visits is provided in the Table 
on the following page.   
Pre-Implant Candidacy Evaluation  
The duration of this testing will be approximately [ADDRESS_1027509] the opportunity to take the consent document home to 
read and discuss with family and friends and will be encouraged to contac t the surgeon 
and/or the audiologist if there are questions.  Study team members will ensure that the 
potential participant is aware of all aspects of cochlear implantation as well as study 
expectations, the surgical procedure, and the post -implant study s chedule.  When 
informed consent is obtained, each section of the consent form will be reviewed and the 
potential participant will be given an opportunity to ask questions.  Individuals who are 
still interested in participating will sign and date the consen t form.  Several aspects of the 
individual’s participation will be highlighted during the consent process: (1) participation 
is voluntary; (2) the participant can withdraw from the study at any point for any reason; 
and (3) the participant will receive app ropriate clinical care whether or not they 
participate in the study.  The participant will be given a copy of the signed consent 
document.   
  
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page [ADDRESS_1027510] never had a failed poor ear HA or BiCROS HA trial will be fit during the 
Candidacy Evaluation and complete a 1 -2 week trial followed by [CONTACT_750503] (Alternative Therapy Assessment).  
Unaided Audiometric Threshold Levels  
Unaided audiometric threshold levels will be obtained to determine if the participant 
meets inclusion criteria.   
Air conduction threshol d levels using insert earphones will be obtained at 250, 500, 
1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and [ADDRESS_1027511] Institute S3.22 -2009 for 
electroacoustic assessme nt will be used to ensure proper HA functioning.  Amplification 
will be evaluated using real -ear measures with the AudioScan VerifitTM (or equivalent) 
system with speech stimuli for input levels of 50, [ADDRESS_1027512].  The evaluation will 
be based on the  National Acoustic Laboratories’ nonlinear fitting procedure, version 2 
(NAL -NL2).  If the participant’s HAs do not meet NAL -NL2 targets within +10 dB from 
500-4000 Hz, the HAs will be re -programmed until targets are met.  If the HAs cannot be 
adjusted to meet targets, the participant will be fit with clinic loaner HAs.  If the severity 
of the hearing loss or tolerance issues prohibit amplification at the prescribed levels, the 
HA will be programmed as close as possible to NAL -NL2 targets.  
Aided, FM Tone S ound Field Threshold levels  
Aided, FM tone threshold levels will be obtained in the sound field for each ear at 250, 
500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hz.  When testing the poor ear, the better ear 
will be plugged and muffed (Howard Leight Pre -Shaped F oam Earplug and Howard 
Leight Hearing Protection Thunder T1 earmuff) (Howard Leight, 2014a , b).  Based on 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_750483], the plug and muff provided an 
attenuation average of 48 dB for frequencies 250 – [ADDRESS_1027513] in two listening 
conditions, 1) HA in the better ear only and 2) HA in the poor ear only.  When testing the 
poor ear, the better ear will be plugged and muffed.  Testing will determine if the 
participant meets incl usion criteria.  
Alternative Therapy Assessment  
Participants who have not previously failed a poor ear HA or BiCROS  HA trial will be fit 
with one of those two HA options.  The audiologist will determine which HA to fit based 
on the participant’s hearing loss and preferences.  After at least 1 to 2 weeks of use, the 
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 17 
 participant will return to the center and complete an evaluation.  Performance will be 
compared (using measures listed below) between the better ear HA -alone condition and 
the bilateral or BiCROS HA condition.  If performance is better in the bilateral or BiCROS 
HA condition versus the better ear HA -alone con dition, and the participant prefers the 
alternative therapy, the participant will not continue in the study.  For participants who do 
continue in the study, these measures will not need to be repeated at the Pre -Implant 
Testing visit.

Safety  
A secondary objective of this study is to obtain data regarding the safety of cochlear 
implantation in adults with asymmetric hearing loss who receive a CI in the poor hearing 
ear and maintain a HA in the better hearing ear.  The safety evaluation will be based on 
the number, type and degree of all adverse events.   
A record of all adverse events will be kept.  No formal statistical hypothesi s will be 
tested.  The primary safety endpoint will be [ADDRESS_1027540] -implant will be summarized by [CONTACT_92920], 
severity/seriousness, and whether related to the device and/or implant procedure.   
Efficacy  
The primary study objective is to obtain preliminary efficacy data in adults with 
asymmetric hearing loss who receive a CI in the poor hearing ear and maintain a HA in 
the better hearing ear.  Efficacy is defined as post -implant improvement in the po or ear 
with a CI compared to pre -implant with a HA.  Measures are sound field threshold levels 
and CNC monosyllabic words in quiet.  
A secondary objective is to obtain efficacy data related to bimodal hearing.  Efficacy is 
defined as post -implant improvemen t (CI in poor ear + HA in better ear) compared to the 
pre-implant best -aided condition (either HAs in both ears, or a HA in the better ear alone 
for adults with no aidable hearing in the poor ear).  Measures are sound localization, 
speech recognition in no ise, speech recognition at soft presentation levels, perceived 
hearing handicap, and reported quality of life.   
Sample Size Justification  
The primary efficacy endpoint is change in CNC performance from pre -implant to post -
implant, with most of the gain ex pected to be achieved by [ADDRESS_1027541] deviations that range from .06 to .24.  Assuming a correlation between 
repeated measures of .5 (typi[INVESTIGATOR_750487])  these values translate into standardized 
mean differences (Cohen’s d) ranging from .[ADDRESS_1027542] (Cohen and 
Cohen, 1983 ; Keppel, 1991 ; Cohen, 1992 ).  As indicated, the planned sample size will 
provide adequate to excellent power to detect clinically meaningful differences.  Up to 40 
participants will be enrolled to allow for attrition.  
Note that the analyses described later will often be more comp lex than the simple 
approach used here for power calculations (a dependent means t -test), often involving 
change over longer periods of time, examining nonlinearity in the change profiles, and 
including additional predictors (e.g., patient characteristics) .  The impact of these 
modifications will generally be to increase power by [CONTACT_750512] w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page [ADDRESS_1027543] which change is compare d.  We chose this simpler power 
analysis approach because it represents well the clinical meaning of improvement and is 
not complicated by [CONTACT_750513].  
Data Analysis  
Prior to the major analyses, the data will be examined for distributiona l abnormalities and 
outliers that might indicate the need for transformation to conform to the assumptions 
(e.g., multivariate normality) underlying the planned statistical procedures.  When 
indicated, standard power transformations will be used to produce  approximately normal 
distributions (e.g., (Tuke y, 1977 ; Hamilton, 1992 ).  If acceptable transformations are not 
available, resampling procedures will be used to confirm the conclusions drawn from the 
analyses. Resampling (e.g., Hamilton, 1992 ; Mooney and Duval, 1993 ; Chernick, 1999 ) 
repre sents a general statistical approach that by[CONTACT_750514] -intensive 
re-sampling of the obtained data to produce empi[INVESTIGATOR_750488].  The approach is especially helpful when standard 
statistical approaches cannot be used with confidence and standard remedies (e.g., 
transformations) are not available.  
Because of the longitudinal nature of the data, the major analytic approach we will use is 
hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002 ; Heck and Thomas, 
2009 ; Hox, 2010 ; Snijders and Bosker, 2012 ).  We chose this approach becau se the 
data have a hierarchical structure, with the measures over time nested within individual 
patients. Thus for the majority of the analyses, we will use a two -level growth curve 
model, with both linear growth and quadratic growth (i.e., change in linea r growth over 
time or departure from an overall linear or straight line pattern) included.  HLM analysis 
is particularly well suited for longitudinal data with unequal spacing of measures and 
occasional missing data, both likely to be true in this study.  Standard approaches, such 
as repeated measures analysis of variance, cannot be used because the measurement 
spacing will vary at the individual level.  Missing data, which is not expected to be 
substantial, is handled in the HLM approach via maximum likeli hood estimation (e.g., 
Enders, 2010 ).  When HLM is used with smaller samples, standard errors may be 
reduced , although parameter estimates should not be biased (Raudenbush and Bryk, 
2002 ).  Accordingly, it may be necessary to use more conservative significance levels.   
Estimation in the HLM approach is best thought of as occurring at different levels.  At 
Level  1 of the statistical model, performance for a particular participant will be estimated 
as a quadratic polynomial growth curve.  This can be described by [CONTACT_430072], 
using CNC performance as the example outcome:  
e Time Time CNC ti2
ti i2 ti i1 i0 ti+ + += 
 
where the CN C performance at time t (e.g., six months) for participant i is estimated to 
be a function of an intercept ( 0i), a linear component for time ( 1i), and a quadratic 
component for time ( 2i).  The coefficients are expected to vary systematically across 
patients. At Level 2 of the model, the coefficients from Level 1 are viewed as outcomes 
that depend on patient characteristics:

i2 i3 23 i2 22 i2 21 20 i2i1 i3 13 i2 12 i1 11 10 i1i0 i3 03 i2 02 i1 01 00 i0
++++=++++=++++=
 
The three equations represent the intercept, linear component, and quadratic compon ent 
of growth, respectively.  The variables D 1i, D2i, and D 3i, represent generic predictors such 
as dummy codes that could represent the particular center from which a patient’s data 
were collected or patient characteristics (e.g., age) that might moderate  the efficacy of 
the implant.  These Level 2 predictors allow for systematic differences in patient 
performance to be detected.  
The HLM approach includes omnibus tests that can be used prior to more focused 
comparisons so that the Type I error rate is not inflated.  Judicious choice of centering 
the time variable allows targeted inferences about particular follow -up time -points. An 
important part of the HLM analysis are the diagnostic procedures to check assumptions 
(e.g., homogeneity of Level 1 variances) or to determine if models can be simplified 
(e.g., Level 2 residual variances of 0).  When necessary, standard model modifications 
will be applied (e.g., modeling sources of Level 1 heterogeneity).  
Some analyses will call for simpler approaches. For example, performance at particular 
measurement points will be of interest (e.g., at Pre -Implant, at [ADDRESS_1027545] -Implant, or 
at the conclusion of the study).  In these simpler analyses, standard univaria te and 
multivariate procedures (e.g., univariate or multivariate multiple regression [if continuous 
predictors are included] or analysis of variance [if only discrete predictors are tested]) will 
be used (Maxwell and Delaney, 1990 ; Keppel, 1991 ). 
Risk Benefit Statement  
The risks associated with CI surgery in this population are no greater than those 
associated with cochlear implantation in general.  Cochlear implantation is an accepted 
treatment option for those with bilateral moderate to profound sensorineural hearing 
loss.  However, the study population will have more residual hearing in the non -
implanted ear and there may be an additional risk of sound interference when adding a 
CI with a contralateral HA.  This will be monitored and recorded based on participant 
reports and comparison of performance between the HA -alone and bimodal conditions.  
Cochlear implantation is the only treatment option th at can restore partial hearing to an 
ear with severe to profound hearing loss.  It is well established that a CI can significantly 
improve audibility and speech understanding for individuals with postlingual onset of 
deafness.  Individuals with SPHL in one  ear and better hearing in the other ear may 
benefit from cochlear implantation by [CONTACT_750515].  Additionally, individuals with asymmetric hearing have the opportunity to benefit 
from HA use in the contralateral e ar that has better hearing.  Research has shown that 
bimodal hearing, a CI in one ear and a HA in the other ear, is well accepted by [CONTACT_750516] -implant ear and is beneficial when listening to soft 
speech, listening to speech in noise and in localizing sound (Ching et al., 2007 ; Potts et 
al., 2009 ; Firszt et al., 2012 ; Morera et al., 2012 ; Dwyer et al., 2014 ).  The potential to 
significantly improve speech recognition in the poor hearing ear, to improve 
understanding of soft speech and speech in noise, and to improve sound localization 
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 26 
 suggests cochlear implantation of the poor ear may provide an acceptable risk -benefit 
ratio for individuals with asymmetric hearing loss as described in this protocol.  
Good Clinical Practices Statement  
The study will be conducted in comp liance with federal standards of Good Clinical 
Practice, applicable government regulations and each investigational site’s Institutional 
Review Board.  Verification of IRB approval will be provided by [CONTACT_750517].  Any deviations from the protocol will be reported to the 
site’s Primary Investigator and the institution’s IRBs following each IRB’s institutional 
guidelines.  
Access to Study Documents and Monitoring  
Research staff at the sponsor site will communicate with  investigational sites at least 
quarterly to review study progress and assure the integrity of the accumulated data.  On - 
site visits to the investigational sites will occur prior to study initiation and at least 
annually thereafter.  Data generated by [CONTACT_750518], the FDA and other regulatory agencies.  
Upon completion of the study, a representative from the Sponsor will conduct a final site 
visit to verify that all participants and their data  are accounted for and that the regulatory 
records are complete.  
Quality Control Assurance  
Data will be provided to the Sponsor on case report forms.  When CRFs are received, 
the forms will be reviewed to verify completeness and to identify inconsistencies  or 
erroneous information.  Corrections to the case report forms shall be made by [CONTACT_750519] (i.e., single line through the incorrect entry, correct entry noted, initials of 
individual making correction, and date correction was made).  The inves tigational site 
will be contact[CONTACT_750520].  
Data received on CRFs will be entered into a database using typi[INVESTIGATOR_750489].  All data entry will be compared to the CRFs by [CONTACT_750521].  Samples of the CRFs received by [CONTACT_750522].  More comprehensive verification will be completed if deemed 
necessary.  
Data and Sa fety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The DSMB consists of three members, none of whom are directly involved in the 
research project:  an otologist, a biostatistician and an audiologist with cochlear implant 
experience.  The DSMB will review interim/cumulative data  for evidence of study -related 
adverse events, efficacy, and data quality, compliance with recruitment goals, adherence 
to the protocol, and factors that might affect the study outcome or impact participant 
safety.   
Institutional Review Board  
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page [ADDRESS_1027546] of 1996 (HIPAA), all information concerning study participants will be  
treated as confidential by [CONTACT_411164].  Each investigational site will 
follow the requirements of the site’s IRB regarding confidentiality.  
Data generated for the study will be stored in a limited -access file area and accessible 
only to study site research team members, the Sponsor, and FDA/relevant health 
authorities/regulatory agencies.  All reports and communications with the Sponsor 
relating to study participants will identify participants only by a unique participant 
identificat ion code.  Full participant identification will be kept by [CONTACT_750523].  
Protocol Amendments  
Protocol modifications that impact participant safety or study validity will be approved by 
[CONTACT_443745].  In addition, modifications will be documented in written 
form and approved by [CONTACT_647760]’s IRB prior to implementation.  In the 
case of a medical emergency, to remove immediate apparent hazard to participants, a 
change may b e made, preferably after discussion with the Sponsor.  In these instances, 
the IRB and FDA will be notified as soon as possible.  
  
Cochlear Implantation of Adults w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 28 
 Data Management  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  
All data requested  on the CRF will be recorded by [CONTACT_1704].  All missing 
data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was 
not done (N/D) or the question was not asked, “N/D” will be written to indicate such.  If 
the item i s not applicable (N/A) to the individual case, “N/A” will be written next to the 
entry.  All entries should be printed legibly.  
If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, a single straight line should 
be drawn through the incorrect entry a nd enter the correct data above it.  All such 
changes must be initialed and dated.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, 
investigators will print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_750490], data generated for the study will be stored in a 
limited -access file area and be accessible only to each study site’s research team 
members, the Sponsor, and FDA/relevant health authorities/regulatory agencies.  All 
reports a nd communications relating to study participants will identify participants only by 
a unique participant identification code.   
The Investigator must provide the Sponsor or designee with the following documents at 
the time of site qualification and prior t o study initiation and retain a copy in the site study

Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any unexpected medical occurrence or worsening of a pre -existing medical 
condition following implantation and exposure to the device, regardless of whether the 
AE is related to the surgery or device.   
Adverse events (AEs) that occur during this study may be associated with the CI 
surgery, including AEs from general anesthesia, or specifically associated with the 
device use.  An AE will be deemed device -related when, in the judgment of the study 
site’s Primary Investigator, there is a logical connection between the device use and th e 
event, above and beyond the study procedure itself.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A SAE is any unexpected medical occurrence which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88789] 24 hours or prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750494]  
• Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to 
a body structure  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment 
of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
A UADE is “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not pre viously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safet y, or welfare of subjects.” [FDA 21 CFR 812.3(s)]  
Investigator Responsibilities  
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible 
AEs.  Of primary concern will be the participant’s safety and providing appropriate 
medical care.  Detailed information regarding AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_750526] w ith Asymmetric Hearing Loss Clinical Trial  Page 30 
 the time an AE occurs using the “ Adverse Event CRF ”.  All AEs will be recorded from the 
day of enrollment to the time when the participant exits the study or to study ter mination, 
whichever is the last, even if the event was acknowledged as a risk factor in the 
Informed Consent . 
AEs will be recorded on the “ Adverse Event CRF ” and will include the following 
information:  
• Date of onset  
• Date reported to the clinic  
• Description of the AE  
• Seriousness (yes or no)  
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the AE to the device  
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the AE to the procedure  
• Treatment  
• Outcome  
• Relationship to device, implantation procedure and/or underly ing disease  
A UADE will be reported directly to the study site’s IRB and the Sponsor within 10 
working days of learning of the event or as dictated by [CONTACT_3452]’s IRB, whichever is 
sooner.  Information regarding the UADE will be recorded on the “ Unant icipated Adverse 
Device Effect CRF”.   
Adverse Event Follow -up – Investigator Responsibilities  
All AEs must be followed until resolution.  The study site will follow -up as necessary with 
the participant to explain as well as possible the reason for and nat ure of the AE.  This 
may include additional tests or consultation with other health care professionals.  The 
Sponsor may request that the study site perform additional specific evaluations.  AE 
follow -up information, as needed, will be recorded using a “ Previously Reported AE or 
UADE Follow -Up CRF”.  
Adverse Event Follow -up – Sponsor Responsibilities  
All AEs will be reported annually to FDA in accordance with the IDE regulation [FDA 21 
CFR Part 812.150(b)(5)].  All UADEs will be reported to FDA within 10 calendar days of 
the event in accordance with FDA 21 CFR Part 812.46(b) and 812.150(b)(1).  The 
Sponsor will notify all study sites of new safety information that alters the current risk -
benefit assessment or that would be sufficient to consider changes in  the overall conduct 
of the clinical trial.  
Protocol Deviations  
Any study -related activity not in compliance with the approved protocol is considered to 
be a protocol deviation.  Deviations required to protect the life or welfare of a participant 
do not re quire approval and should be performed immediately.  The IRB must be notified 
within 5 days of the event.   
If a study participant is unable to return for a study visit within the allotted ± [ADDRESS_1027548] the primary endpoint.  
Discontinued Participants  
Any participant can discontinue the study at any time without prejudice.  The site’s 
Primary Investigator may also discontinue a par ticipant at any time if health is a risk or if 
the participant is uncooperative and otherwise impacting the integrity of the data.  All 
withdrawals will be documented including the reason for withdrawal.  Efforts will be put 
forth to ensure near complete f ollow -up, particularly on assessment of primary outcomes 
and occurrence of adverse events.  Regular reminders, flexibility in scheduling of study 
visits to coincide with clinical visits, and close monitoring of due dates will facilitate 
obtaining as comple te data as possible.  Participants lost to follow -up will be contact[CONTACT_750527], email or mail.    
Premature Study Termination  
Each study site reserves the right to discontinue the study for any safety, ethical or 
administrative reason s at any time.  Participants who have already been implanted with 
the device will receive support, independent of study continuation.    
Product Accountability  
The three CI devices commercially available in the [LOCATION_002] will be used during the 
study.  The devices are manufactured by [CONTACT_749257], LLC (PMA 
P960058/S089/S098/S102), Cochlear Americas (PMA P970051/S028/S064/S096), and 
Med-EL Corporation (PMA P000025/S023/S029/S050/S061/S077).  All devices are 
commercially available and ship with their current commercial labeling.  
Because these devices are commercially available, no investigational labeling is 
included.

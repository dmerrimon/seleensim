DESIGN:  Work2Prevent  will advance  the science by [CONTACT_78389], tailoring, and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-testing a novel social and structural-level HIV intervention 
for YMSM and YTW of color ages16 -24 aime d at increa sing 
economic stability (i.e., employment) through youth empowerment 
and asset development, and decreasing HIV risk behaviors (i.e., 
sex work) associated with social and economic marginalization. 
DURATION:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing will last approximately 22 months   
POPULATION:  All focus group, p ilot-test, and the majority of key informant 
interview study participants will be Black/African American and/or 
Hispanic/Latinos males and transgender women (those assigned 
male at birth), ages 16 -24 who identify as either: (1) a man who has 
sex with men (MSM) and/or gay or bisexual man; or (2) a 
transgender woman and/or transse xual male-to-female/transwoman. 
Additionally, key informant interview study pa rticipants will be any 
race/ethnicity and sex/gender, but will be identified as an employer 
and/or hiring manager of an LGBT-inclusive company.  
STUDY INTERVENTION:  Intervention will consist of a series of 4 workshops that promote job 
seeking self -efficacy and job readiness. These workshops will be 
adapted from the existing iFOUR curriculum, a job readiness 
program for transwomen developed by [CONTACT_397205]. The 
iFOUR curriculum will be adapted based on feedback from the 
CAB, focus groups, and key informant interviews.   
DATA COLLECTION:  Data will be collected through transcribed, digital audio -recorded 
interviews, ACASI, and eCRFs.  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  Determine the essential components of a theoretically -driven and 
developmentally -appropriate e mployment intervention aimed at 
increasing job seeking self-efficacy and readiness among YMSM 
and YTW of color ages 16 -24. 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  Review and adapt relevant intervention components from the 
existing evidence -based employment program for HIV -positive 
adults (iFOUR) to YMSM and YTW of color.   
TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:  Refine and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the employment intervention .  
Refine and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the intervention in community -based settings.  
RISK/BENEFIT CATEGORY:  Minimal  
MONITORING:  Routine team monitoring of any adverse impact of the study will 
rely on the ATN Protocol Query & Notification System, a real -time, 
web-based interactive reporting system. Sites will also record and

Rev 08/05/[ADDRESS_499819] sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTW) face enormous 
disparities. In particular, HIV  risk and infection among YMSM  and Y TW remains a significant public 
health problem. Furthermore, YMSM  and YTW  experience  social  and economic  marginalization, which 
leads to high rates of unempl oyment,  sex work, drug use, homelessness,  and HIV risk. Sex in exchange  for 
money, drugs,  and/or food among  YMSM  and YTW  of color  is a significant  public  health  problem.  
Adolescent  sex work places  YMSM  and YTW  at increased  risk for STIs, HIV,  poor mental  health  
outcomes,  and subst ance abuse. Interventions  that trace  and disrupt  the pathways between social  and 
structural  determinants  of HIV infection  are needed. Structural -level  interventions  foster agency  to allow  
individuals  to act in their own and  their communities’  best interes ts, and have  been  positi vely associa ted 
with the uptake  of behavioral  and biomedical  technologi es, as well as the promotion  of health -enabling  
environments. To  date, few struct ural interventions  targeti ng adolescent  sexual  and gender  minorities  
exist,  and we know  of no studi es that have  explicitly  examined  the role  of employment  on HIV risk and 
prevention  for YMSM  and YTW.  Employment  as prevention  has the potential  to be a scala ble intervention  
that can be deployed  among  at-risk YMSM  and YTW.  
In the US,  YMSM  and YTW, experience  high rates  of HIV  infection  (CDC, 2012, 2013; Herbst et al., 
2008) . In 2010, YMSM,  including  YTW, age  13-24 rep resented 19% of all new HIV infections, and 72% 
of infections among adolescents (CDC, 2012) . However, such disparities  cannot  be attributed  to 
individual -level  risk alone,  but are situated  within larger  social and structural  contexts  that proximate  
YMSM  and YTW  of color  to increased  HIV expos ure (Baral et al., 2013; Bauer, Travers, Scanlon, & 
Coleman, 2012; Brennan et al., 2012; Garofalo, Osmer, Sullivan, Doll, & Harper, 2006; IOM, 2011; 
Operario & Nemoto, 2010) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_397188],  LGBT  people  face persistent  stigma,  
discrimination,  and victimization  in school,  the workpl ace, housing,  and health  care (Melendez et al., 
2006; Santos et al., 2014) .  Such  inequities  are met with limited  legal protectio ns as few state laws 
speci fically  protect  LBGT  people. As a result, a fair majority  of YMSM  and YTW  of color  live in poverty, 
experiencing  high rates  of homelessness,  unemploy ment, and limited  access  to health and HIV 
services (Bradford, Reisner, Honnold, & Xavier, 2013; Gayles, Kuhns, Kwon, Mustanski, & Garofalo, 
2016; Meyer, 2003; Millett et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2014; Sevelius, Patouhas, Keatley, & Johnson, 
2014) . 
Faced  with few economic  options  and protectio ns, YMSM  and YTW  may migrate  to non-tradition al 
economies or  “street  careers”  as a means  of survival.  In a study conducted  by [CONTACT_397206]/AIDS  Interventions  (ATN)  members in Los Angeles  (Belzer)  and Chicago  (Garofalo)  
[Co-I for this proposal],  76% of 151 YTW  ages 15-24 reported  engaging  in sex work,  with 35% in the past 
3-months (Auerbach, Parkhurst, & Caceres, 2011; Xavier, Bobbin, Singer, & Budd, 2005) . Among  HIV-
positive  YTW,  23% were  involved  in sex work —underscori ng the link between  adolescent  sex work  and 
HIV (Xavier et al., 2005) . In a large study  of YMSM  of color  (n=3,316,  median  age 19), roughly  12% 
reported  engaging in  sex work  (past  6-months)  (Melendez & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946], 2007) . Sex work  and HIV risk are 
further  complicated  by [CONTACT_397207]  (Gayles et al., 2016) .  Scala ble, low-cost, but potentially 
high impact, structural-level interventions that trace and disrupt the pathways between social and 
economic marginalization and adolescent HIV infection are sorely needed (Clements -Nolle, Marx, & 
Katz, 2006; Kammerer, Mason, Connors, & Durkee, 2001; Lomabrdi, Wilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 
2002) . Structural interventions, such as comprehensive sex education, universal condom access, clean 
syringe exchange, and increas ed healthcare coverage have significantly reduced the incidence of HIV 
(Bockting, Miner, Swinburne Romine, Hamilton, & Coleman, 2013; Bradford et al., 2013; Clements -
Nolle et al., 2006; Durso, Kastanis, Wilson, & Meyer, 2013; Grant et al., 2011; Kammerer et al., 2001; 
Lomabrdi et al., 2002; Reisner, Bailey, & Sevelius, 2014) . The objective of the proposed study is to

13 target economic stability (i.e., employment) as a structural -level intervention for preventing adolescent 
HIV. The  proposed  study will adapt  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test an effec tive theoreticall y-driven,  employment  program  
for HIV-positive  adults  (iFOUR ) (A Broken Bargain for LGBT Workers of Color , 2013; Dyer et al.,

Krehely, 2010; Wilson et al., 2009) to the needs  of at-risk YMSM and  YTW  of color,  ages 16-24. This 
proposal  is responsive  to the NIH HIV/AIDS  high priority  topic  by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007],  testing,  and implementing

2.4  Study Hypotheses/Research Questions   
We hypoth esize that this intervention  will be both feasible  and acceptable  to the target  populations  and 
that the intervention  will incre ase job self-efficacy and readiness,  as well as decrease HIV risk behavior.  
This study  will lead  to a final intervention  manual  to be tested  in an R01-type,  large  multi -site trial across  
the ATN study  sites.  
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
All research activities except for the community -based pi[INVESTIGATOR_397189] 
(UC), Center  for Interdisci plinary Inquiry  and Innovation  in Sexual  and Reproductive  Health  (Ci3). Ci3 is 
a foundation  and federally  funded  research  center focused  on advancing  adolesc ent sexual and 
reproductive  health  and rights  through innovative research  methodologies,  intervention  strategies,  and 
novel  solutions  to broad social  problems.  Ci3 has a dedicated  research  team  skilled  in cross-discipli nary 
collaboration  focus ed on adolescent  health  along with  a broad network of commu nity partners working 
with LGB T adolescents, and environments that will support the successful development, 
implementation, and evaluation of the project .

 Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_397190] a private area for the confidential conduct of the study, including study visits 
and workshop sessions.    
Conceptual  Model:  Our conceptual model (Figure 1 ) draws on the existing iFOUR theoretical 
framework that  operationalizes the Health Belief Model ( HBM ) and the Supported Employment  Model 
(SE) to hypothesize the potential relationship between adolescent employment and HIV risk. W e 
propose that employment, and subsequent economic connection and stability, serves as a structural -level 
intervention for adolescent HIV. Based on prior research, we hypothesize that the adapted and tailored 
iFOUR intervention will facilitate increased jo b seeking  self-efficacy and job readiness [Path A]  and 
ultimately increase employment placement and maintenance [Path B]. Further, we hypothesize that 
establishing economic stability will decrease engagement in HIV risk behaviors and increase HIV 
preventio n and care [Path C], and  decrease involvement with known social determinants of HIV (e.g., 
sex work, drug abuse) [Path D], that are directly linked to HIV transmission and acquisition [Paths E & 
F] among YMSM and YTW of color.

4.3 Recruitment and Screening  
Recru itment. Study participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_21171] (RAs) and study recruiters who 
are also  members of the target popu lation. For the CAB, focus groups, and key informant interviews , 
participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_397210] -existing network connections, including the Chicago 
Center for HIV Elimination and snowball sampling.  Planned recruitment strategies for LGBT -Inclusive 
Employers also include attending LGBTQ job fairs and emailing LGBTQ non -profits, LGBTQ -owned 
small businesses, and employers in the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index or Out & 
Equal, LGBT CareerLink lists.  
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_397191] s, participants will be recruited actively by [CONTACT_397211], and local gathering places and events for 
YMSM and YTW such as  night clubs, House & Ball events, and other p ublic places that serve the LGBT 
community (e.g., LGBT cen ters). Additionally, participants will be asked to refer friends or acquaintances  
that may be eligible. Passive recruitment will include posting study flyers and posters, and describing the 
study on Facebo ok and other social media websites.   
4.4 Informed Consent  
Consent  Proces s. Eligible study participants will be taken through the informed consent p rocess in a 
private room.  RAs will review the consent process to make a formal asse ssment of the participant’s 
decisional capac ity to conse nt prior to signing using a 2-step process. First, the RA will determine if the 
person unde rstands the study goals by [CONTACT_7939] “Can you tell me what this study is abou t?” In step 2, 
potential participants will be asked questions designed to assess  their capacity to unde rstand, appreciate, 
reason  with, and express a choice about participation in our spec ific protocol. Participants  are asked to: (1) 
name [CONTACT_112539]; (2) explain what they would do if they no longer 
wished to participate in the study; (3) explain what they would do if they experienced  distress du ring the 
study; and (4) identify potential risks for pa rticipating in the study. Responde nts will be enrolled only if 
they are able to provide clear and correct answers to each of these items. If study staff feels there is a 
question about the need  for a more formal asses sment of the decisional c apacity of a potential pa rticipant, 
they will con tact the Project Lead or other senior staff. Additionally, study staff will inform the person 
that the research study is voluntary and their dec ision whether or not to participate will not impact their 
relationsh ip with the research site or any subsequent participa tion in research studies or car e provided by [CONTACT_112769].  If they agree to participate, they will be immediately enrolled in the study (Appendix VI).

19 Paren tal Consen t. We will not require parental consent for study enrollment and participation. Parental 
consent may decrease participation rates becau se some youth will fear that they may be “outed” as a result 
of participation. Disclosure of sexual o rientation or gender  identity may place participating youth at risk 
for parental harassment, abuse or expulsion from the home. The nature and scope  of the proposed  research 
do not  pose more than “minimal risk” to participants (45 CFR Part 46.102): “the probab ility and 
magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than 
those ordinarily encoun tered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or  psychological 
examinations or tests.” Study measures are standard in this popu lation, as are waivers of parental 
permission for survey and interview studies. Additionally, risk beha vior asses sments will be based  on the 
National Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2015,  which has been  administered to youth in 9th to 12th grade. 
HIV/STI testing is also common (and encou raged) a mong this group, and  does not require parental 
permission or notification in the state of Illinois. 
To compensate for waiver of parental consent p articipants receive a formal individual assess ment of 
capac ity to conse nt (above) to ensure their understanding of study goals, proced ures, and risks from 
disclosure of sens itive information (see Consent Process). Consistent with national po licy 
recommenda tions from the Society for Adolescent Medicine, requiring parental pe rmission for the 
proposed  study would have a number of poss ible negative effects, including: (1) reduc ing the validity of 
the findings by [CONTACT_397212]/guardians; (2) increasing risk to some youth whose parents have a negative response  to the 
material in the permission forms that would (correctly) suggest their child has a minority or alternative 
gender identity; and (3) add ing little in the way of actual su bject protection, given the minimal risk of 
study participation.  
4.[ADDRESS_499836] Information Form will not contain any study data and will be maintained under double locks 
at the study site, separate from all study records, with access limited to designated site research personnel.  
4.6 Co-enrollment Guidelines  
Studies that open after this protocol is implemented can be considered for co -enrollment either by 
[CONTACT_103806] a blanket, one -time approval from the protocol team or by [CONTACT_397213] -by-case permission 
for co -enroll ment in writing from the protocol chair .  
5.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Aim 1: Determine the essential  components  of a theoreticall y-driven and developmentall y-
appropriat e empl oyment intervention  aimed  at increasing  job seeking  self-effica cy and readiness  
among  YMSM  and YTW  of color  ages 16-24. Two formative  assessment  strategies  will be used to 
determine  the essenti al components  of the employment  intervention:  (1) focus  groups  and (2) key 
informant  interv iews (Aim  1). First,  focus groups  be conducted  with current ly empl oyed and 
unemployed  (but seeking  employment)  YMSM  and YTW.  The goal of the  focus  groups  will be to 
ATN 151  
  Version 5.2 
  05/23/2017  
Rev 08/05/2019  
 
20 explore  and identify  the following:  perceived  barriers  to employment,  beliefs  in the benefit  of 
employment,  and career  counseling  needs of YMSM  and YTW. Additio nally, key components, 
including  potential  models  of the adapted iFOUR  employment  curriculum  will be shared and discussed 
with participan ts in order  to gauge  relevance  and potential  modif ications  for the target  population.  
Next,  we will conduct  key informant  interviews  with YMSM,  YTW,  and LGBT -inclusive  employers.  
The goal of this phase  of formative  research  will be to hone  and identif y key areas  related  to barrie rs 
and facilitators to hiring  and retainin g YMSM and YTW : YMS M and YTW caree r readiness,  
identifying  an inclusive employer,  and post- placement  support  necessary  to retain  YMSM  and YTW  
(Appendix II example  interview  guide).  
Focus  Groups:   Recruitmen t and Enrol lment.  We will recruit  up to 80 YMSM  and YTW of color,  ages 16-
24, to participate  in one of up to 10 focus groups  . 
Key Informant  Intervie ws: Recruitment  and Enrollment.  We will recruit  up to 64 key informant  YMSM  
(up to 12 ), YTW  (up to 12 ), and LGBT -inclusive  employers  (up to 40) to particip ate in key informant  
interviews.  Over [ADDRESS_499837]  a Corporate  Equality  Index  of 100%  (e.g.,  
Groupon,  Inc., McDonalds  Corp.,  etc) (HRC, 2015) . 
 
Aim 2: Review  and adapt  relevant  intervention  components  from  the existing  evidence -based 
empl oyment program  for HIV -positive  adults  (iFOUR)  to YMSM  and YTW  of color.  
Convene  a Community  Advisory  Board  (CAB).  Up to a 12-mem ber CAB  of YMSM,  YTW,  youth -
serving employment  and vocational  speci alists, LGBT  emplo yment  training  and placement  experts,  and 
sexual  health educators  will be led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hill and the investigative  team.  Members  of the  CAB  will 
meet  no less than [ADDRESS_499838]  YMSM’s  and YTW’s  experience  and employment  needs  (Aim  2).  
Aim 3: Refine , pre-test, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test the employment  intervention.  In order  to achieve Aim 3, we 
will incorporate  all qualita tive findings  and refine  the final interv ention  curric ulum modul es using  
additional feedback  from the CAB.  In addition, the CAB will assist with Phase [ADDRESS_499839] be pre-tested (Baseline , workshop s, Post-intervention ) with 
an initial sample of up to [ADDRESS_499840] of the final adapted  employment  intervention  will be completed with a 
diverse sample  of up to 70 YMSM  and YTW,  ages 16-24, in a single-arm longitudinal  pre/post  study of  
the employment  intervention  to evaluate  feasibil ity, acceptability,  program  satisf action, and preliminary 
efficacy  using assessments  at Baseline  (T1),  Post-Intervention  (T2),  and 8 Months  Follow -Up (T3).   
Aim 4: Refine  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test the intervention in community -based setting s. In order  to achieve Aim 4, we 
will refine  the procedures and intervention so that it may be conducted within community -based settings  
in order to  further test the implementation of assessments and workshop activities  in Phase 3 .  
The adapted  employment  intervention  will be completed with a diverse sample  of 40 YMSM  and YTW,  
ages 16-24, in a single-arm longitudinal  pre/post  study of  the employment  intervention  to evaluate  
feasibil ity, acceptability,  program  satisf action, and preliminary efficacy  using assessments  at Baseline  
(T1),  Post-Intervention  (T2),  and 3 Months  Follow -Up  (T3).

An ATN Study  Identification number ( SID) will be assigned by [CONTACT_397214] ( CDART ).  
5.2 Intervention/Investigation Procedures  
Up to 7 0 participants  will be enrolled for the intervention  pi[INVESTIGATOR_397192] 2  and up to 40 participants 
for phase 3 . Participants will complete a 4 session  workshop. Workshops will be in groups of 6 -12. These 
workshops will be based on the pre-existing iFOUR  program  (description below)  with modifications 
based on CAB, fo cus group, pre-test, and int erview er feedback.  
iFOUR  
The Increase Individual Income and Independence program (iFOUR) is an employment program that was 
developed over ten years ago to target the employment needs of HIV - positive people. The program was 
based on the Supported Employment framework that was developed to help connect people with a range 
of disabilities (physical and cognitive) to employment because of the benefits of employment, both 
monetary and non -monetary. Thus, researchers at the University of Illin ois-Chicago collaborated with 
Chicago House, a housing and support organization for HIV - positive individuals, to develop a Supported 
Employment program for HIV - positive individuals. Like Supported Employment, iFOUR provides a 
variety of supports to aid i n participants' job success, such as job training referrals, client -tailored job 
placement, post -employment assistance, and benefits planning. The program includes regular interviews 
to evaluate program outcomes, such as medication adherence, use of drugs and alcohol, and assessments 
of physical and mental health. Since 2005, the iFOUR program has been refined to better tailor to the 
needs of HIV - positive individuals, including the addition of one -on-one work with a career specialist. 
These specialists ass ess job readiness and are trained in the impact of HIV/AIDS on employment, so as to 
best assist participants with their career aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]. They also assist with linking participants to additional 
educational resources and provide support with interview pr eparation and development of resumes and 
cover letters. iFOUR also includes a four -week training workshop that is tailored to the needs of HIV -
positive participants, dealing with questions such as workplace discrimination, benefits maintenance, and 
the rel ationship of health beliefs and work. The workshop also covers confidence and communication 
skills, while highlighting the non -monetary benefits of employment. The iFOUR program has had 
positive outcomes for participants, documented in several studies (App endix IV). The goal of the current 
study is to tailor then pi[INVESTIGATOR_397193] -negative but at high -risk 
for acquiring HIV.

 GCP training  
 Human Subjects Protection training  
 W2P Workshop Facilitator Training : Members of the research team who facilitate workshop 
sessions will be trained by [CONTACT_397215]. This training includes an 
overview of how iF OUR  was implemented, challenges in implementation, and best practices for 
ensuring the utility of career readiness training.  
 Title IX  Training : All staff will complete  annual Title IX training in the prevention of sexual 
assault and sexual misconduct  via “Intersections: Preventing Harassment and Sexual Violence”  
 Suspected Child Abuse Reporting  Training : All staff will review guidelines related to their status 
as mandated reporters of suspected child abuse and neglect  if applicable by [CONTACT_76522] . 
Additionally, staff may opt  to complete the web-based training “Recognizing and Reporting

 HIV Testing Training : Staff engaged in the collection of biological samples will complete  a [ADDRESS_499842] AIDS Training and Education Center . 
 Ready Set PrEP! Training : All staff will complete training regarding HIV prevention and PrEP 
access through the AIDS Foundation of Chicago’s (AFC) “Ready Set PrEP!” This tr aining 
focuses on how antiretroviral medication can be used for prevention of HIV transmission and 
how social determinants of health impact PrEP access.  
5.2.4 Intervention Monitoring /Quality Control  
Research staff running the workshops will complete fidel ity assessment s during administration of  each 
workshop class to help ensure and evaluate homogeneity across workshop groups.  In addition, workshop 
staff will conduct a debriefing session after the administration of each workshop class in order to note any 
issues or observations.   
6.[ADDRESS_499843]-Intervention visits . We 
will then pi[INVESTIGATOR_397194] p articipants in a single -arm longitudinal pre -/post -study. A t Baseline , 
participants will complete a 30-60 minute audio -computer assisted self -interview (ACASI) survey covering  
sociodemographics, employment variables, HIV risk behavior variables, and potential modifying variables. 
Participants will also be asked fo r biological specimen  collection  for HIV/STIs screening and drug testing 
(such as  urine, oral /laryngeal  swab,  finger stick,  and anal swab).  Upon completion of the employment 
intervention  at Post-Intervention , participants will be asked to complete a second  30-[ADDRESS_499844]-intervention , participants will be asked to return to the 
study site to complete the Follow -Up visit and repeat  ACASI survey assessing sociodemographics, 
employment variables, HIV risk behavior variables, and potential modifying variables , as well as to provide 
repeat  biological specimens for HIV/STIs screening and drug testing.  
Phase 3  
We will further adapt study procedures and the employment intervention  so that it may be administered in  
community -based settings . All study procedures for Phase 3 are same as Phase 2 e xcept that the Follow -
Up visit is at 3 months follow -up, and the ACASI survey s are shorter in length at 20 -45 minutes each visit.

7.0 DATA COLLECTION AND SITE MONITORING  
7.1 Development of Protocol and Case Report Forms  
The ATN CC, in collaboration with the Protocol Team, is responsible for the development of this 
protocol as well as the Case Report Forms (CRFs) and Audio Computer -Assisted Self Interview 
(ACASI ). All CRFs for this study will be available for download from the ATN study website.  
7.[ADDRESS_499849] 
information collected on the ATN 151 Screening Form , which  will be entered into the study database 
using a method to maintain anonymit y. 
7.3  Data Collection  and Submission  
Research staff will be responsible for ensuring that CRF data is entered into CDART within one calendar 
week of data collection  in a timely manner . Data edits through range checks and field inconsistencies will 
ATN 151  
  Version 5.2 
  05/23/2017  
Rev 08/05/2019  
 
25 be built into the CDART database to enable real time correction of key entries and CRF completion 
errors.  
All data collected using  ACASI will be  developed within the CDART  web-based system . The 
participant’s SID will be used in order to link the interview responses to the participant’s CRF data. The 
ACASI data will be collected on Apple iPad devices using Qualtrics and the CDART data management 
tool. Data are stored on secure server s maintained by [CONTACT_3433] e ATN CC. No data is written to the iPad hard 
drive. Since data are persisted to the secure servers during data collection, if a network failure occurs 
during an interview little to no data will b e lost. The secured servers comply with FIMSA regulations  and 
are tightly controlled , and inaccessible to any person or application without appropriate credentials.  
Focus group  and key informant interviews will be digitally audio -recorded with participant consent. 
Immediately upon completion, th e digital audio files will be uploaded to a secure server. The audio 
recordings will be uploaded to a secure website belonging to a transcription company  (CastingWords) , 
who will listen to the recordings, transcribe them into a Microsoft Word file, and upl oad the transcript 
files to their secure website for download by [CONTACT_464]. Transcripts will be checked against audio 
recordings for accuracy. Once that process is complete, the audio files will be destroyed. [CONTACT_116044]  will 
ensure that the audio files are  destroyed by [CONTACT_397218], and permanently deleted from the 
University of Chicago OBGYN  server.  
Data fr om focus groups and key informant interview s will be transferred to the ATN CC. This data and 
all data collected using CDART will be submi tted to the NICHD’s Data and Specimen Hub (DASH) after 
completion of the study in accordance with the NICHD DASH Data Archive Policy 
(https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/Resource/Policies ) and the NIH Gra nts Policy Statement

Site study staff will track participant study recruitment and retention for all study  visits , as well as 
intervention sessions completed by [CONTACT_4317].   
8.[ADDRESS_499852] attempts.  
 For p articipants  that complete all [ADDRESS_499853] -intervention visit  will need to be 
completed w/in [ADDRESS_499854] workshop session , otherwise they may go on to complete the 
follow -up visit  at 8 months (±4 weeks) after the last workshop session  for Phase 2 and at 3 months (±2 
weeks ) for Phase 3 .  
 For participants  that complete  at least one but less than all four  of the workshop sessions  in the time 
allowed (within 12 weeks of baseline for Phase 2, and 4 weeks for Phase 3) , the post -intervention visit  
will need to be completed withi n [ADDRESS_499855] class 
completed ( ±4 weeks ) for Phase 2, and [ADDRESS_499856] class completed (±2  weeks ) for phase 3.   
 For participants  that do not complete any workshop sessions, the follow -up visit will need to be 
completed at 8 months (±4 weeks)  after Baseline for Phase 2, and 3 months (±2 weeks)  for Phase 3 .  
8.2.1  Completing the Audio Computer Assisted Self -Interview  
 The participant is reminded of his or her right to discontinue at any time with no penalty and 
the right to choose to leave any questions unanswered;  
 The participant is given headphones and a iPad in an accommodating, private and quiet area;   
 The research  staff assists with ACASI tutorials;  and 
 If the participant requires a break, research  staff will make sure the computer program is exited 
and re -entered properly so that the participant’s privacy is maintained   
8.2.1  Debriefing and Referral Pr ocedures for Audio Computer Assisted Self -Interview Participants  
 The participant will be debriefed about possible reactions to answering questions of a sensitive 
nature, such as short -term feelings of sadness or anxiety. Participants will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_397220];  
 Referrals for mental health services will be provided to all participants, if warranted; and  
 At the completion of the ACASI, the  research  staff member present during the session will ask 
the following question:  “Is there anything else about the interview that you would like to 
discuss?”

27 If the respondent says “no,”  they should  be thanked for participation. The respondent will be given 
contact [CONTACT_397221].   
If the response indicates the participant is in urgent need of mental health assistance, site staff should 
follow their individual site procedures for acute mental health referrals. Site staff s hould contact a 
supervisor immediately and stay with the study participant until the supervisor, mental health 
profes sional or emergency s ervices, if needed, arrives. Otherwise, the interviewer should say, "If you 
decide that you would like to speak with a counselor, here is the contact [CONTACT_19297] a counselor 
and a list of agencies in the community that provide this  service” and provide the list of referrals.  
8.3 Compensation  
Focus Groups :  Participants will receive $40 each for focus group participation. 
Key Informant Interviews : LGBTQ -friendly employers will be offered a $[ADDRESS_499857] for key informant 
interview participation. All other p articipants will receive $40 for key  informant interview participation.

8.4 Intervening on “Social Harms"  
8.4.[ADDRESS_499859] access  to a clinician or soc ial worker who can help them address any feelings and/or questions 
which arise over the course of their participation. The investigative team has condu cted studies with 
hund reds of assessment visits and has managed all visits succes sfully. Proced ures for youth who do 
experience discomfort are detailed below. 
All study records that identify the participant will be kept co nfidential, however there is a risk of loss of 
confidentiality such as by [CONTACT_397222] /neglect for participants 16-17 years old. All 
healthcare professionals are required by [CONTACT_397223]/or neglect. Although 
several of the proposed  assessment measures include elicit information about e xperiences  of 
discrimination and sexual beha viors, they do not specifically address child abuse  or neglect. Thus, a report 
of abuse  or neglect will only occur  if the participant knowingly volunteers this information. In addition, 
ATN 151  
  Version 5.2 
  05/23/2017  
Rev 08/05/2019  
 
28 all participants are told in the consent p rocess that statements of potential ha rm-to-self or others may 
require further assessment and/or reporting. The research team has  specific procedu res in place for 
referrals and strict co nfidentiality reporting. 
Additionally, a potential risk to confidentiality may occur if a participant tests positive for HIV or an  STI 
during the cou rse of the study. All participants will be told of reporting requirements during the consent 
process. If a participant tests positive for HIV or an  STI, s/he will be referred to the Chicago Center for 
HIV Elimination (CCHE) for confirmatory HIV testing and appropriate care. CCHE is required to report 
all new cases of HIV by [CONTACT_397224]. Other 
information, including risk factors and sex contacts, are also requested for pa rtner services. As an 
additional s afeguard, the proposed study has two practicing physicians who have extensive experience 
treating STIs and HIV/AIDS among YMSM and YTW of color. 
There is a general potential risk of a breach in confidentiality of participant information. However, all 
investigators and study staff have been  involved in several local and  national s tudies of YMSM and YTW 
and ha ve considerable experience implementing measures to protect participant confidentiality. Some of 
these s teps include signed confidentiality agreements, in-service training on confidentiality, and the 
assignment of study ID numbers for all participants. Additionally, all front-line research staff who will be 
working with the pa rticipants throughout the project will unde rgo routine ethics training and complete 
specialized confidentiality training around  HIV and other sens itive issues  through the Chicago 
Department of Public Health. All staff will have completed training regarding HIV prevention and PrEP 
access  through the AIDS Found ation of Chicago’s (AFC) “Ready  Set PrEP!” shou ld participants request  
additional information on these services. All staff will complete the Midwest AIDS Training and 
Education (MATEC) training and CDC Passpo rt to Partner Services HIV and  STI Prevention training 
prior to implementation. All data will be collected on secure network hosted by [CONTACT_397225]. 
8.4.[ADDRESS_499860] risk  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Discomfort or distress during the research   
Because  there is a potential for discomfort or distress due to the research topic, we will make every effort 
to create a secure environment (ensuring privacy) prior to conduc ting base line and follow-up assess ments 
and intervention sessions. Participants will be told that they do not ha ve to answer any question they do 
not wish to. Participants experiencing mild distress during the assessments will be offered a small break or 
will be reschedu led to complete the asses sment at a later da te. In the unlikely event that a  participant 
experiences  considerable distress, we will make a referral (if needed)  for clinical assess ment and/or 
counseling provided at each of the primary sites. Participants will be given the names and office phone  
numbers of the assessor, the Site Lead, and the Project Coordinator, and  will be provided with referrals 
for mental hea lth and supp ort services. The Site Lead  will be on-call for any  serious problems that a rise 
during asses sments and intervention sessions.

29 [IP_ADDRESS]  Disclosure  of abuse, homicide or suicide risk  
A number of proced ures will be taken to minimize risk to participants. The conse nt procedu res will 
explicitly state that participation in the research is voluntary, and that questionna ires will include items 
about sexual h istory, substance use, and sexual risk beha viors. Participants will be informed of the 
confidentiality of their respons es as well as the limits of that confidentiality. If a participant d iscloses 
suicidal ideation, any type of violence,  or homicidal intent, the research team will assess  the level of risk 
and determine the best course of action (e.g., sending the participant to the emergency room, notifying the 
police). Youth under age [ADDRESS_499861] cou rse of 
action, and that under cond itions of immediate danger or harm may require reporting or notification to 
appropriate authorities (i.e. the police or the Department of Children and Family Services). A 
determination of the decision-making capac ity of the participants will be done  prior to obtaining conse nt 
and research staff will pay  particular attention to participants’ understanding of the risks assoc iated with 
disclosure of information and the implications of that disclosure in accordance  with state law. 
During all study visits, there will be an on-site behavioral hea lth clinician or social worker to provide 
clinical bac kup to the RA, particularly conce rning issues  of child abuse, neglect, and suicidality. The on-
site beha vioral hea lth staff will have specific clinical expertise in managing the unique challenges facing 
young  sexual and gender minorities. Consistent with abuse  and/or neglect reporting requirements, shou ld 
a report to the au thorities be required, the information provided will be from the Project Lead at each  site. 
No mention of the youth’s participation in this particular research project will be disclosed.  We will 
inform pa rticipants that criminal beha vior (i.e. drug use) is not reported to authorities and that the 
information is entirely confidential. These p rocedu res will be reviewed in writing and in person by [CONTACT_397226], and  to minimize the inadvertent d isclosure of information. Regardless of age, if a participant 
discloses suicidal ideation or intent, the beha vioral hea lth clinician or social worker will be available to 
assess the level of risk and to help determine the best cou rse of action (e.g. send  to the emergency  room). 
8.5 Criteria for Premature Discontinuation  
Participants may choose to withdraw themselv es from the study at any time. The study is voluntary and 
the alternative to participating in any phase of the study is not participating.  
9.0 MONITORING & REPORTING SAFETY  EVENTS   
Site staff must follow their oversight  IRB's procedure for reporting and managing safety  events , as well as 
the ATN CC procedures outlined below  and in Chapter 10 of the ATN Manual of Policies and Procedures 
(MOPP) . Safety events  are reported  using the ATN QNS accessible through the  ATN website 
(https://www2.cscc.unc.edu/atn/ ). All safety events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_397227].  
9.1 Study Team Review  
Given that this study is a short pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a behavioral intervention with a single arm (a pre -/post 
study), this study will use  study team review for  clinical research monitoring (CRM), where the study 
team consists of the Protocol Team at UC , a NIH re presentative, and the Coordinating Center (CC) at 
UNC Chapel Hill. Safety  events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_64839] a case -by-case basis  at team 
meetings which will occur at least mont hly. The members of the study team and data to be reviewed at the 
meetings are described below.     
ATN 151  
  Version 5.2

Rev 08/05/2019  
 
30 Study team members:  
 Protocol Chair (s)  
 ATN Coordinating Center Investigator  
 Protocol Manager  
 Project Manager  
 NIH Representative  
During the study team meetings,  data quality and participant safety (e.g., number and type of  safety 
events , recruitment and retention ) will be reviewed  and the team will determine what actions are 
necessary , if any . The study team will also previously reported safety events  for which new information is 
available . 
The CC will monitor accrual and retention based on reports which they will generate monthly . Reports 
will include accrual, baseline characteristics, data quality, and completeness.  If there are any problems 
with accrual or retention rates at specific sites, the CC will work with the site to identify operational 
issues or problems and take appropriate action.  
9.2       Reportable Safety Event s  
There are three types of reportable safety events  that require expedited reporting in QNS (within 2 
reporting days of sit e awareness) :  
1. Adverse events (AEs) deemed to be possibly related or definitely related to the study that are 
severity grade 3 or higher  
2. All s erious adverse events (SAEs)  
3. Untoward events (UEs) deemed to be possibly related or definitely related  to the study that are 
severity grade 3 or higher  
Please note that all community UEs (not graded) and UEs grades [ADDRESS_499862] be reported within 5 reporting days of site 
awarene ss, and are up to the discretion of the site investigator and protocol team as to whether or not they 
are reportable.  
Once entered into QNS and after study team review, s afety event reports should be printed and filed with 
participant records (or with reg ulatory documents if not related to a specific participant ). In addition, 
study staff must also follow their oversight IRB procedures for reporting and managing safety events.  
For more information regarding the definitions of each type of  safety event  and details on reporting, 
please refer to the ATN CC MOPP Chapter 10.  
9.[ADDRESS_499863] be reported for the du ration of that participant’s enrollment in the study. After the 
protocol -defined reporting period ends, only events that study staff become aware of on a passive basis 
(from publicly available information) should be reported.  
The duration of the reporting period for community UEs events begins at project start -up and continues 
through any professional or lay publication of study findings. If the online reporting system is not 
available after study closure, electronic reports should be made directly to Progr am Staff at NICHD.  
ATN 151  
  Version 5.2 
  05/23/2017  
Rev 08/05/2019  
 
31 All potential safety events should be reported as soon as possible after site staff become aware of the 
event. Events that require expedited reporting ( are grade 3 or higher or SAEs of any grade) must be 
reported within 2 reporting days (see guidance below) of site awaren ess. Grades 1 & [ADDRESS_499864] be reported within 5 reporting days of site awareness.  
Reporting Days:  
• A reporting day starts at 12:00 AM (midnight) and ends at 11:59 PM local time.  
• A day is counted a s a reporting day regardless of the time of day that awareness occurred. The 
day a site indicates that site personnel became aware of an EAE that meets reporting criteria shall 
count as day 1 if that day occurs on a reporting day (i.e., Monday through Frid ay). If that day 
occurs on a non -reporting day (i.e., Saturday or Sunday), then the next reporting day shall count 
as day 1.  
• Monday through Friday count as reporting days.  
• Saturday and Sunday are not considered reporting days.  
• Any holiday that occurs on a Monday through Friday counts as a reporting day.  
10.0 STATISTICAL/ANALYTIC  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.[ADDRESS_499865] of qualitative 
research using focus groups of both: (1) the study population (i.e., YMSM and YTW); and (2) employers 
of the study population. The goal of Phase I is to tailor the interv ention, designed to increase employment 
in an adult population, to the study population.  
Phase II and III of the protocol will use a pre -/post design to determine preliminary efficacy of the revised 
intervention tailored to youth and designed to increase e mployment. Additional secondary outcomes, and 
potential mediators and effect modifiers of the intervention, will be considered.  
10.[ADDRESS_499866], at the expense of having a comparison group. This trade -off was appropriate given the 
exploratory nature of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_397195] . 
10.3  Statistical Analysis Plan  
10.3.1  Data Analysis  
The analytic plan is designed to : (1) tailor the adult intervention to youth; (2) assess intervention 
feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction ; and (3) determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention by 
[CONTACT_397228]-/post  assessments of employment  and sexual  risk behaviors . 
Phase I  
Data collection, storage, and analysis will take place at the study site (University of Chicago) and will be 
the resp onsibility of the Protocol Chair.  
Interviews and focus groups will be transcribed and coded by [CONTACT_397229]. These 
transcripts will be coded for patterns and themes that emerge from the data, and these data will be used to 
inform the rev ision of the employment intervention that will then be pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested. All focus groups and 
ATN 151  
  Version 5.2 
  05/23/2017  
Rev 08/05/2019  
 
32 key informant interviews will be digitally audio -recorded, transcribed (verbatim), and analyzed using 
emergent inductive logic data  aggregation and analysis in Atlas. ti 7.0. Major emergent themes will be 
used to create a codebook and two -independent coders will analyze all data separately and compare 
coding schema for internal reliability (Kappa) (Aim 1). Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the 
proportions a nd central tendencies  for all feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction measures: helpfulness, 
comprehensibility, quality, content appropriateness, engagement, utility, satisfaction, belief in efficacy, 
and recommendation to a friend.  
Datasets for Phase  I will be cleaned, verified and archived, and then entered into SPSS for analyses. All 
database files will be password -protected and backed up to a secure university server daily.  
Phase II  and III  
[IP_ADDRESS] Descriptive statistics  
Descriptive statistics wil l be used to analyze the proportions and central tendencies for participant 
sociodemographic characteristics collected in the surveys completed by [CONTACT_397230][INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tests. We 
will first generate frequencies, means, and other measures of central tendency as appropriate to describe 
our sample and outcomes at each of the three time points (T1, T2, T3). Sensitivity analyses will be 
performed to address extreme outlying variables , including the removal of records with extreme outlying 
values from analyses.  
Changes in primary and secondary outcomes between Baseline (T1) and Follow -Up (T3) will be assessed 
using paired t -tests for continuous variables and McNemar’s test for categor ical variables . Other statistical 
tests that appropriately account for the correlation in the dataset will be considered as needed.  All 
hypothesis testing will be done at an alpha -level of 0.1, given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/exploratory nature of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Modeling 
The primary goal of the modeling will be to help evaluate what characteristics could be mediators or 
effect modifiers of the effect of the intervention . Continuous outcomes will be analyzed using linear 
regression or generalized linear models, discret e outcomes will be analyzed using Poisson regression, and 
logistic regression will be used for binary and categorical outcomes . Only variables that have a 
statistically significant univariate relationship with the given outcome, at an alpha -level of 0.2, w ill be 
considered as potential mediators or effect modifiers for the effect of the intervention . 
Datasets for Phase 2 and 3 will be collected using CDART and cleaned, verified and archived by [CONTACT_397231].  
10.4 Missing, Unused and Spurious Data  
Every effort  will be made to ensure that the amount of missing data is kept to a minimum , as missing data 
can complicate the statistical analyses and/or result in biased parameter estimates.  
Several procedures will be used to conduct data analysis when data for eithe r outcomes or covariates are 
missing. The first step will be to assess the extent and pattern of missing data. If data are missing for only 
a few cases, then data analysis will be conducted only on study participants with complete data. However, 
when such a strategy would result in loss of data from a substantial proportion of participants, or if this 
approach would lead to biased or inaccurate results, then multiple imputation will be used.   
When the primary endpoint is missing, one data analysis will be c onducted using only cases with the 
endpoint.  
Participants who do not complete all of the workshops will still be included in the analysis if they attend 
the follow up visit (T3), in a similar manner as intent -to-treat, where individuals are assumed to have 
received the intervention that was intended.  We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis excluding these

Rev 08/05/[ADDRESS_499867] any study -specific identification recorded 
on their labels or associated requisition forms. Study data  will not be releas ed without written permission 
of the participant (and parent or legal guardian, when applicable), except as mandated by [CONTACT_67204] . 
Once all data has been  collected, identifying participant  information (including name) will be stripped  
from the database. Consents will only be access ible to designated research staff, and stored in a locked 
filing cabinet in secure offices.  
Computer files consisting of the participant tracking database, study data files, and  transcriptions will be 
stored on a UNC  server. The participant tracking database  contains contact [CONTACT_397232], and is completely pass word protected. The tracking database does not 
contain any clinical (i.e., personal  health information) or research-based  information; it only has 
information the participant has agreed to provide for the pu rposes  of tracking and communication. 
Data files are exported from the web-based  ACASI program (administered on a web-based  iPad platform) 
to a UNC  server and imported into the CDART  database  for storage and analysis. Transcripts are entered 
into Atlas.ti for storage and analysis also on the UNC  server. Data files do not include information that 
could be used to identify the participant from the data file alone. CDART is protected with indus try 
recognized security standards which will enc rypt data and will be further protected by [CONTACT_397233], to protect participant co nfidentiality. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_499868] Retention  
All data will be destroyed 7 years after the study is completed  or per NIH and/or institutional guidelines,

Risks to participants in this research study may include:    
Risk Category: Research not involving greater than minimal risk (45 CRF §46.404 and 21 CFR §50.51 )  
Participation in this study poses no more harm or discomfort to research participants than they may 
experience in normal daily life or during routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.  
Participation in this study does not involve any physica l risk. However, there is some risk of emotional 
discomfort or distress due to the personal nature of some questions. Participants will be informed that 
they are free to decline to answer any questions, or withdraw from participation at any time without 
penalty. Participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_397234]. If the response indicates the participant is in 
urgent need of mental health assistance, site s taff should follow their individual site  procedures for acute 
mental health referrals. Site staff s hould contact a supervisor immediately and stay with the study 
participant until the supervisor, mental health professional , or emergency services, if needed , arrives . 
11.3.[ADDRESS_499871] ( IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
This protocol, the informed consent documents , and any s ubsequent modifications will be  reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_397235] f or the oversight of the study. The informed consent 
will describe the  purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of 
participation.   
Signed  informed consent will be obtained from the participant (or parent, legal guardian, or person with 
power of attorney for participants who c annot consent for themselves). The participant ’s assent must also 
be obtained if he or she is able to understand the nature, significance, and risks of the study. The signed 
original consent/assent form will be kept on file at the site and a copy of the co nsent/assent form will be 
given to the participant and to the parent or legal guardian, if applicable.   
11.4.1 R isk Category: Minimal Risk  
Permission will be sought from at least one parent or guardian in accordance with local IRB/EC approved 
procedures unless the IRB/EC has waived the requirements for obtaining parental or guardian permission 
in accordance with 45 CFR §46.408 (c).

35 Assent of the children involved in this study will be sought in accordance with the regulations at 45 CFR 
§46.408(a) or 21 C FR §50.55 and local IRB/EC -approved policies and procedures.  
11.5 Waiver of the Requirement for Parental Permission for Special Circumstances   
Participating site IRB s will be requested to grant a waiver of parental/legal guardian consent to participate 
in this research study for youth participants under the age of legal majority based on state or local laws.  
Under 45 CFR Part 46.4116 (c), an IRB has the authority to waive parental permission if it determines 
that “a research protocol is designed for condit ions or a subject population for which parental or guardian 
permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects” and “an appropriate mechanism for 
protecting the children who will participate as research subjects is substituted” and “that th e waiver is not 
inconsistent with Federal, state, or local law.”  
The protocol team would submit that:  
 This study is not conside red greater than minimal risk. Participants will complete surveys and supply  
specimens for routine HIV monitoring. None of the content of this study is beyond what would be 
covered during routine medical or psychological visits or procedures related to the pr oblem behaviors 
being studied. The probability of harm from participating  in this study is no greater than that 
occurring in routine care.  
 The ATN site involved in the study and most other community agencies offering HIV -related services 
are confidential and do not require parental/legal guardian notification or permission to t reat under 
state regulations.  
 Contact[CONTACT_30697] a parent/legal guardian could constitute a breach of confidentiality for these HIV -positive 
participants and could potentially put some HIV -positive youth at risk for abuse or ousting from the 
home if parents/guardi ans are not aware of their HIV status.  
 It is expected that there will be participants who have not disclosed their HIV status to 
parents/guardians nor will the parents/guardian be aware of the  participant’s risk behaviors. A 
requirement for parental permis sion in this type of study could not only affect a person’s willingness 
to participate, but could also potentially impact the ability of researchers to engage in this type of 
HIV-related research with youth.  
 Adequate protection has been substituted by [CONTACT_397236].  
Under Illinois law (410 ILCS 305/9) minors can consent to STI and HIV testing without the consent or 
knowledge of said minor’s parent.

Rev 08/05/[ADDRESS_499880] ask that only one person  speaks  at a time.   
I am here to ask questions,  listen,  and make  sure everyone  has a chance  to share.  We would  like to hear 
from  all of you so if you’re  talking  a lot, I may ask you to give others  a chance.  If you aren’t  saying  much,  
I might  call on you to share  your ideas.  We will be recording  the session  to make  sure we don’t  miss 
anything  you say, but what  you say will not be linked  to your name  [CONTACT_397239].   
Also,  we want  to remind  you to please  not share  what  you hear in this group  today.  By [CONTACT_6073],  a focus  
group  is neither  private  nor confidential.  However,  it is important  that what  we say here stays  within the 
group.  If you want  to use the bathroom,  please  feel free, we just ask that you get up quietly.  Please  keep  
your cell phones  turned  off until we finish  the session.  We really  appreciate  your full participation.  
Let’s  begin.  To find out a bit more  about each other,  we will go around  the circle.  When  it is your turn, 
please  tell us your first name,  your favorite  city (other  than Chicago),  and where  you’d  like to go on 
vacation  if you could  go anywhere  in the world.  
1. I’d like to start by [CONTACT_397237].  What  kinds  of jobs have  you had in your 
lifetime?  What  is your favorite  job that you have  had?  What  did you like about  that job? What  is 
your least favorite  job? What  did you not like about  that job? 
2. Let’s  talk about  the job search.  How do you find out about  jobs you might  want  to apply  for? 
[Probe:  internet  – what  sites in particular?,  friends,  family,  etc.] When  looking  online,  what  do 
you search  for? When  you look at a job posting,  what  makes  you decide  to apply?  What  makes  
you decid e not to? 
3. Now  let’s talk about  applying  for a job. What  kinds  of things  have  you had to do to apply  for a 
job? [Probe:  in person  vs. online  application]  Have  you had to provide  a resume?  How  did you 
get your resume  ready?  What  do you include  on your resume ? What  do you leave  off?  
4. Okay,  let’s say you get an interview  for a job. How  do you prepare  for the interview?  What  do 
you wear?  What  time do you show  up? How  does your self-presentation  during  an interview  
differ  from  your self-presentation  on a regular  day?   
5. What  kinds  of experiences  have  you had during  job interviews?  What  questions  have  you been  
asked?  What  was the hardest  question  to answer?  Have  you been  asked  things  that seemed  
inappropriate  (unprofessional)?  Can you give examples?  Have  you ever not gotten  a job because  
of your sexual  orientation  or gender  identity?  How  do you know  that was the reason?

42 6. So let’s say you get hired  for a job (congratulations!).  What  kinds  of challenges  might  a young  
(gay man OR trans  woman)  of color  face when  starting  a new job? When  if ever do you disclose  
your (sexual  orientation  OR gender  identity)?  [Transwomen:  How  do you deal with providing  
paperwork  that might  not match  your gender  presentation?]  
7. Thinking  about  discrimination  at work  now:  Have  you ever had to interact with a 
(homophobic/transphobic)  co-worker  or boss?  What  happened?  How  did you respond?  Were  
there  any people  at that job who supported  you?  Were  there  any policies  against  discrimination?    
8. What  is the longest  you have  ever worked  at the same  place?  What was it about  that job that 
made  you want  to stay?  Did your employer  have  policies  that kept other  co-workers  or 
supervisors  from  discriminating  against  you because  of your sexual  orientation  or gender  
identity?  What  were  those  policies?  How  were  they communicated  to employees?  How  were  they 
enforced?   
9. Thinking  about  positive  work  environments  now:  Have  you ever had a job where  you felt safe 
being  “out”  about  your sexual  orientation/gender  identity?  What  made  that environment  feel safe 
and supportive?  What  could  employers  promote  that kind of supportive  environment?   
Thank  you so much  for your time and input!  We really  appreciate  your participation,  and we value  your 
feedback.

iFOUR Description  
Description of the iFOUR Program  
The Increase Individual Income and Independence program (iFOUR) is an employment program that was 
developed over ten years ago to target the employment needs of HIV -positive people. The program was 
based on the Supported Employment framework that was devel oped to help connect people with a range 
of disabilities (physical and cognitive) to employment because of the benefits of employment, both 
monetary and non -monetary. Thus, researchers at the University of Illinois -Chicago collaborated with 
Chicago House, a housing and support organization for HIV -positive individuals, to develop a Supported 
Employment program for HIV -positive individuals. Like Supported Employment, iFOUR provides a 
variety of supports to aid in participants' job success, such as job traini ng referrals, client -tailored job 
placement, post -employment assistance, and benefits planning. The program includes regular interviews 
to evaluate program outcomes, such as medication adherence, use of drugs and alcohol, and assessments 
of physical and me ntal health. Since 2005, the iFOUR program has been refined to better tailor to the 
needs of HIV -positive individuals, including the addition of one -on-one work with a career specialist. 
These specialists assess job readiness and are trained in the impact of HIV/AIDS on employment, so as to 
best assist participants with their career aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]. They also assist with linking participants to additional 
educational resources and provide support with interview preparation and development of resumes and 
cover l etters. iFOUR also includes a four -week training workshop that is tailored to the needs of HIV -
positive participants, dealing with questions such as workplace discrimination, benefits maintenance, and 
the relationship of health beliefs and work. The worksh op also covers confidence and communication 
skills, while highlighting the non -monetary benefits of employment. The iFOUR program has had 
positive outcomes for participants, documented in several studies (see references below). The goal of the 
current stud y is to tailor and then pi[INVESTIGATOR_397201] -negative but 
at high -risk for acquiring HIV.

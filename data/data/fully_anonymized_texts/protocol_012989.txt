PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  HIIN – COPD:   A Cluster Randomized, Stepped -Wedge Evaluation of Post 
Discharge Utilization among Patients wit h an Acute Exacerbation of COPD  
Study Design  A cluster randomized, stepped -wedge quality improvement evaluation  
Study 
Objectives  The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of using a COPD clinical 
pathway compared to usual care among patients with an acute COPD 
exacerbation, on [ADDRESS_333478] discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, and observation 
encounters)  
 
The secondary objectives are to examine the COPD clinical pathway’s effect on 
additional patient outcomes, such as the  
a. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care 30 -day readmission rate. This is a 
readmission rate among patients with an inpatient readmission to the same 
CHS facility as the index encounter.  
b. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate 
among patients with an inpatient or observation readmission to any CHS 
facility.  
c. The patient -centric 30 -day readmission rate where the primary diagnosis of 
the readmission is COPD.  
d. Length of stay  
e. Rate of follow -up visit within 5 days of discharge.  
f. Antibiotic order rate during admission  
g. Steroid order rate during admission  
h. Short acting bronchodilator order rate during admission  
Additional analyses will be to explore:  
 
a. The methodology for identification of COPD exacerbation within the first 
24 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272804]. 
b. As a sub -analysis, qualitative outcomes will be collected and measured 
with patients, providers, and leaders. These outcomes will be collected and 
evaluated, per a sub -study protocol addendum.  
Study 
Population  Patients 40 years of age or older hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272805]. A n acute exacerbation is defined as an encounter where the 
following criteria are met within 24 hours of admission.  
 
• The use of the COPD PowerPlan  or 
• A respi[INVESTIGATOR_272806] 
• The use of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_272807]: 1.0  
Version Date: 5 -15-17 
  
5 • A historical diagnosis of COPD or 
A history of COPD in the admitting documentation or 
A COPD diagnosis on the problem list AND  
An order of systemic steroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone)  
 
For the purposes of this project, the evaluable population will include patients who 
meet the same age criteria and have a discharge diagnosis of acu te exacerbation of 
COPD  
Study 
Procedures  During this project, patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272808] 
(COPD Pathway). The COPD clinical pathway will include four components: (i) 
discrete, evidence -based care steps (ii) patient navigation, (iii) daily data driven 
care gap identification, (iv) monthly leadership huddles.  
 
The evidence based care steps include: (1) verification of COPD diagnosis and 
severity, (2) patient/caregiver education regarding CO PD and basic self -
management skills, (3) standard pharmacologic bundle of systemic steroids, 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_126342], bronchodilators, (4) pneumococcal and influenza vaccination 
review and completion, (5) smoking cessation advice and therapy when 
appropriate, (6) comprehensive care management assessment, (7) 
recommendations for pulmonary consultation, (8) recommendations for palliative 
care consultation, (9) use of discharge checklist, (10) recommendations for content 
of outpatient follow -up, and will be driven  primarily by [CONTACT_272858] a 
comprehensive order -set that includes each component and a discharge check list.   
 
Patient navigation will be provided by [CONTACT_272859]  (COPD 
Coordinator) at each site. This role will be filled by [CONTACT_28045] (s) who already 
exists on a site’s care team. Because of this, the COPD Coordinator’s site role and 
background may vary by [CONTACT_3725]. The COPD Coordinators will be responsible for 
daily  monitoring of care gaps that exist for COPD patients and their respective 
sites and alerting appropriate team member to help close those gaps. The COPD 
Coordinators will receive a daily COPD Gaps list. The COPD Gaps list identifies 
patients who are hospit alized at that time and the associated gaps in receiving the 
evidence based care components.  
 
The intervention occurs at the site level and sites are randomized to the order they 
will receive the intervention in clusters of two.  Two additional facilities  will be 
added on a rolling basis in [ADDRESS_333479] criteria:  
 
• On a long acting bronchodilator for 24 hours  
• A short acting bronchodilator is scheduled no more frequently than 4 times 
daily for 24 hours

  • Be off IV steroids for 24 hours prior to discharge  
• A steroid prescri ption, or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• An antibiotic prescribed or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• A scheduled appointment with a care provider within 5 days of discharge  
• Received COPD education during discharge  
Statistical 
Analysis  Analyses is among patients identified as having an acute exacerbation of COPD 
based on final billed coding.  Comparisons of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272809].  The primary outcome, 60 -day utilization, will be compared between the 
two groups of patients using a logit link in the generalized estimating equations. 
Results will be present ed with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  
Sample Size 
Analysis  8 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272810] 2 facilities per 2 month 
increments. With the assumption of detecting a change in rates of 60 -day non -
elective acute care utilization from 43% in the control period to 33% in the 
intervention period, 59 patients with COPD exacerbation per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272811] a power of 0.80 (intra -class correlation coefficients 
(ICC)=0.05 and two -side α=0.05. To account for this varying cluster size, we 
inflated the number of patients by 25% resulting in an average of 74 patients per 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272812], resulting in a total sample size of 2960 patients among 
the intervention group.

1.3. Secondary Objectives  
 
a. The secondary objectives are to examine the COPD clinical pathway’s effect on additional patient 
outcomes, such as the  
i. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care [ADDRESS_333484] 24 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272814].  
c. Demographics and comorbid conditions will be characterized among the historical population of

2. BACKGRO UND  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by [CONTACT_96896][INVESTIGATOR_037], incompletely reversible expi[INVESTIGATOR_272815], intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_272816]. CO PD is hallmark ed with  periods of symptom stability, 
and periodic acute deteriorations of the patient’s disease condition, called exacerbations. Acute COPD 
exacerbations frequently lead to ED utilization and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272817]1. Reported 
COPD costs in the U.S. have reached approximately $ [ADDRESS_333485]  the estimated costs, and are only expected to contin ue rising.  Prior to implementation of the CMS 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272818], approximately 20% of patients admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272819] (all cause) within 30 days. Other types of acute care utilization following 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174847] (ED visits, Urgent Care encounters, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272820]2.   
Less stringent definitions of care utilization including readmission and ED and/or Urgent Care encounters 
further than 30 days out, can safely be assumed to be even worse.  
 
With the advent  of value based care , and the rise of bundled payments for a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_272821], 
it has become increasingly important to devise innovative care delivery systems and pathways that will 
both treat patients effectively in the acute setting and pr event readmissions. Further haste driving

10 innovation and work in this disease state, has been Medicare’s identification of COPD as a target for the 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272818] . This program  penalizes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272822] [ADDRESS_333486] a valid assessment of benefit, necessitate strategic, a 
priori evaluation planning and execution prior to widespread implementation.  
 
Healthcare systems  are increasingly adopting disease specific Clinical Pathways (CPW’s) . These pathways  
are structured , multidisciplinary care plans, often inclusiv e of order sets, that detail necessary care steps for 
patients with a specific disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_272823] 1980’s and fairly ubiquitous in many 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272824] 2000’s, they have a limited evidence base. A [ADDRESS_333487] , due to variability in study design s. However, 
review of the resulting data did show reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77085] (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.36 -0.94).  
Another review show ed that a 3 -month integrated disease management intervention (multidisciplinary, 
multi -faceted care)  among inpatients  was beneficial  with [ADDRESS_333488] been ongoing efforts to define the COPD population based on biologic factors, clinic al 
characteristics, and social determinants of health to help identify patients at risk for exacerbations, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], and mortality.  Some factors associated with increased risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272825] t failure, behavioral health issues, medical frailty, increasing age, and 
(simply) prior admission for a COPD exacerbation3,8.  Predictive models and scoring systems have been 
devised, most commonly using dyspnea scores, measurements of expi[INVESTIGATOR_272826], previous 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], age, and chronic comorbidities; however, use of these tools has not been proven to reduce 
acute healthcare utilization.  Attempts at care pathways for delivery of standardized intervention for acute 
COPD exacer bations and complex care interventions for patients with COPD have produced equivocal 
results and there is lack of consensus as to whether such clinical care pathways convincingly improve 
overall patient outc omes.  
 
Even as improvements are made in terms of  the understanding of the COPD population , and risk factors for 
readmission, the optimal method to reduce utilization  remains questionable. Attempts at care pathways  
nationwide , and other interventions for COPD patients have been undertaken with mixed repo rts of 
success. The state of research is best summarized by [CONTACT_272860] , while several intermediate or process -
oriented outcomes (such as patient self -report of ability to manage symptoms or number of follow -up 
phone calls made to patients) have been impacted by [CONTACT_272861], studies to date 
have yet  to convincingly illustrate an improvement in utilization rates after any such intervention9-11. 
 
3. RATIONALE  
To better enhance the care of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD, Carolinas HealthCare System 
(CHS) has designed a COPD clinical pathway, a structured multidisciplinary care plan. The care plan 
utilizes a  data system that identifies patients with exacerbation and care gaps in real -time. It includes an 
EMR based order set, patient education, and discharge criteria. A COPD pathway coordinator wh o works 
to close care gaps and ensure a standardized approach is also part of the care plan.  
 
Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: [ADDRESS_333489]  includes the following key components 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: and an order within 24 hours of being admitted of a short acting bronchodilator, an 
antibiotic, and a steroid, as well as a standardized discharge plan. A patient’s journey through the clinical  
pathway, ends at discharge. The discharge checklist requires that patients:  
 
• Be on a long acting bronchodilator for 24 hours  
• Bo on a short acting bronchodilator is scheduled no more frequently than 4 times daily for 24 hours  
• Be off IV steroids for 24 hou rs prior to discharge  
• Have a steroid prescription, or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• Have an antibiotic prescribed or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• Have a scheduled appointment with a care provider within 5 days of discharge  
• Receive COPD education during discharge  
This proposed evaluation is designed to guide CHS strategy and quality improvement for COPD by 
[CONTACT_272862]. Ultimately, as CHS deploys 
resource intensive i nterventions like this, it is important for the system and its patients to know answers to 
questions such as: Does this process impact readmissions and utilization?  
 
This research project is a pragmatic, randomized quality improvement evaluation which seek s to evaluate 
the effects of standardizing the use of a COPD clinical pathway across various participating facilities 
among patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD.  The outcomes evaluation of this quality 
improvement intervention has been designed to integrate into the routine care and minimize frontline staff 
burden by [CONTACT_272863] a real -world setting with no additional data collection 
outside of usual care.   
 
4. SUBJECT AND SITE SEL ECTION  
4.[ADDRESS_333490] will indicate patients newly hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272827] 24 -hour 
period) with symptoms of suspected acute COPD exacerbat ion, at any of the eight facilities. The list 
contains inpatient and observation encounters. The patient list will identify patients at any of the eight 
facilities throughout the project, not just once the facility has implemented the standardized use of t he 
COPD clinical pathway. For the purposes of this project, we are not enrolling towards a targeted patient 
accrual. We will enroll patients during a pre -determined data collection period, See Section 6.  
 
4.2 Subjects  
 
An acute exacerbation is defined as a n encounter where one the following criteria are met within 24 hours of 
admission.  
 
• The use of the COPD PowerPlan or 
• A respi[INVESTIGATOR_272828]: 1.0

• A historical diagnosis of COPD or 
A history of COPD in the admitting documentation or 
A COPD diagnosis on the problem list AND  
An order of systemic steroids (prednisone or methylprednisolone)  
 
To identify appropriate records of available clinical data for baseline and historical data collection and 
analysis, we will provision using the following ICD 10 code  for COPD:  J44.[ADDRESS_333491].

5.1.2 Secondary Outcome Variable(s)  
Secondary outcome variables of the evaluation include:  
 
Examining the COPD clinical pathway’s effect on additional patient outcomes, such as the  
i. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care [ADDRESS_333496] 24 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272831].  
 
As a sub -analysis, qualitative outcomes will be collected and measured with patients, providers, 
and leaders. These outcomes will be collected and evaluated, per a sub -study protocol addendum.  
 
5.2 Trial Design  
5.2.1  Justification for stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial  
The primary aim is to assess the effectiveness of a structured multidisciplinary care plans 
(intervention ), compared with standard care (control) on 60 -day non -elective acute care utilization 
(ED visits, obs ervation , and inpatient encounters). The COPD clinical pathway  will be delivered at 
the level of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272832] , thus minimizing contamination and the risk of selection bias , if 
subjects were randomized at the individual level12. Therefore, the unit of randomization and 
Version Number: 1.0  
Version Date: [ADDRESS_333497] volume and characteristics of patients in 
each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Thus, the stepped wedge design is advantageous  compared with other alternative 
designs.  
5.2.2 Randomization and allocation  
The stepped w edge design implies a baseline period , in which no clusters are exposed to the 
intervention12. Then, at the chosen tim e interval of two months, two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272833] ( Figure 1 ). This process continues until all eight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272834]. The order of this cross over process will be randomized . We 
will use block randomization to assign two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272835] a time to switch from the control to 
intervention using SAS Enterprise Guide version 6.1. Allocation will be communicated only to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272836]. Others including providers at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272837] -out. Patients in included hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272838].

5.2.3 Sample size analysis  
Calculations of sample size were based on the primary endpoints of 60 -day non -elective acute care 
utilization. With the assumption of detecting a change in rates of 60 -day non -elective acute care 
utilization from 43% in the control period to 33% in the intervention period , 59 patients with 
COPD exacerbation per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272839] a power of 0.80 (intra-class 
correlation coefficients (ICC) =0.05  and two -side α=0.05. Holding other parameters constant, the 
larger ICC is, the higher the power we will  obtain ( Figure 2 ). With sample size s per cluster per 
two months ranging from 30 to 158, our preliminary data shows that the coefficient of variation 
(CV) of sample size is approximately  0.5. To account for this varying cluster size, we inflated the 
number o f patients by 25% resulting in an average of [ADDRESS_333498] 1-Dec

The count, rates and 95% confidence intervals of [ADDRESS_333500] ed using  generalized estimating equations with fixed effects for intervention,  time (steps), and 
intervention multiply by [CONTACT_29623], accounting for the c luster randomized trial design with a random cluster 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) effect. We will estimate and report the intra class correlation coefficients for all outcome 
measures to assess assumptions for sample size analyses and for future investigations using simila r designs 
and outcomes. The primary  analyses will follow the intention to treat principle with an additional per 
protocol analysis  including by [CONTACT_272865] . The seco ndary analyses will include within cluster comparisons 
of intervention and control periods (not adjusting for any confounding effect of time) , as well as 
comparisons of a series of (unbalanced) quasi -parallel cluster trials  between those enrolled and unenr olled 
clusters at each intervention enrollment period . The same analyses plan will also be applied to secondary

18 • Stability on a long actin g bronchodilator  (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_35444], serevent)  
• Not requiring a short -acting bronchodilator more than qid  (e.g., albuterol, ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 
ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] -albuterol ) 
• Be on an oral steroid for 24 hours prior to discharge (e.g., prednisone, methylprednisolone)  
• A steroi d prescribed , supplied , or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• An antibiotic prescribed,  supplied , or have completed a 5 -day course while admitted  
• A scheduled appointment with a care provider within 5 days of discharge  
• Received COPD education prior to discharge  
7.1.4.  Patient  Identification and Care Gaps  
Patients are identified as de scribed in the ‘Subjects’ section. Care gaps that are monitored daily 
include the initiation  of the COPD PowerPlan  and the Respi[INVESTIGATOR_272846] D 
bronchodilat or protocol. The PowerPlan includes order sets for  a bronchodilator, an antibiotic, 
and a steroid . 
7.1.5.  COPD Pathway Coordinator  
Once a patient is identified,  their clinical path will be guided by [CONTACT_272867] c oordinator. These 
individuals will monitor the use of the COPD clinical p athway and assure that all milestones 
within the patient experience are addressed  including assuring that discharge needs are met . The 
Pathway Coordinator will use the COPD Pathway Pr ogram which will inform the flowsheet used 
to track and record the patients clinical path. The COPD Pathway Coordinator  will be 
responsible for  report ing any pathway gaps to both the discharge facilitator and the clinician 
involved in the patient ’s care.   
8. STUDY GOVERNANCE  
This quality improvement trial will be conducted at Carolinas HealthCare System.  It will be run jointly by 
[CONTACT_272868] (CORE) and the Pulmonology Department. Daniel 
Howard , MD, ( Pulmonologist ) will ser ve as the Princip al Investigator and Jason Roberge as the C o-
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_272847] (EC).  The EC will consist of leaders 
across the System involved in the trial, quality improvement, and implementation (Table 1).  The EC will 
have the overall responsibility of trial oversight and direction.  Th e EC will support dissemination of 
project findings and next steps.  The EC will receive monthly progress reports and will meet periodically  
for status updates from the team and to set direction.  When appropriate, ad hoc committee meetings will 
be schedul ed to discuss pressing concerns.

already leveraged in CHS facilities. While based  on evidence and present in some facilities, t hese elements 
of care  are not consistently applied across sites and COPD patients .  
 
There is always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information  (PHI) or medical 
information. However, the p rocesses identified in this protocol to enable the execution of this project,  do 
not increase inherent risk of disclosure. Carolinas HealthCare System utilizes several  hard and soft safety 
controls in the protection of patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are not 
limited to, multiple system firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices 
and bui ldings housing research and  patient data, and multiple layers of username [CONTACT_272870].  The project team will ensure that appropriate handling of patient PHI follows 
standard CHS procedure. In the event of PHI disclosure, the appropriate departments will be informed per 
legislation and privacy regulations.  
9.1. Data and Safety Monitoring P lan 
The Co-PIs are responsible for the ethical and compliant conduct of this project in accordance with 
local, state, and federal laws and regulations. Ongoing supervision of the study progress and conduct 
will be facilitated thro ugh at least monthly meetings with key stakeholders and the PI s. These monthly 
meetings will address  data updates , milestones, and concerns. Because this project presents no more 
than minimal risk to patients, per the FDA Guidance for Clinical Sponsors: Es tablishment and 
Operations of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, this study does not require oversight by a 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board or Committee.  
10. RESEARCH COMPLETION

For any closure, the following applies:  
• Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• All affected institutions must be informed as applicable , according to local law.   
• In case of a partial study or site closure, patients still participating in the COPD clinical pathway , or 
those who are considered in follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
 
The study will be considered complete when one or more of the following conditions is met:  
• The enrollment period has ended, and the data collection period is complete.  
• The IRB or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_272849].  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_272850] -off date.  
Upon study completion, a final report will be presented to the Executive Committee and all key 
stakeholders. The final report will detail all findings including primary, secondary and exploratory 
outcomes. The team will also prepare a manuscript for publication

1.1 SYNOPSIS  
 
Title: Prospective R andomized  Evaluation of 14F Thal Tube vs  [ADDRESS_775705] Tube for Hemothorax and Use of Maximum Barrier Precautions  
Phase:  Recruiting

[ADDRESS_775706], Charlotte, NC [ZIP_CODE]  
Study Description:  Traumatic hemothor ax and hemopneumothorax are common diagnoses 
which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_588990] a chest tube. A retrospective 
review has previously shown equivalence between [ADDRESS_775707] tubes and 
32 – [ADDRESS_775708] tubes for the non- emergent drainage of hemothorax;  
however, this study was not randomized. We seek to perform a prospective randomized trial that is adequately powered comparing efficacy of [ADDRESS_775709] tube insertions and compare empyema rates to our historical controls for patients with hemothorax, hemopneumothorax, and pneumothorax.  
Study Population:  Patients aged 18 and older diagnosed with a tra umatic pneumothorax, 
hemothorax or hemopneumothorax that require non -emergent 
placement of a thoracostomy tube as part of their care.  
Aims: Aim 1: Determine the safety and efficacy non -inferiority between small 
bore (14 Fr) and large bore (28 Fr) in the drainage of traumatic 
hemothorax and hemopneumothorax   
Aim 2: Determine the incidence of empyema in the setting of traumatic 
pneumothorax, hemothorax and hemopneumothorax with the addition of maximum barrier precautions  
 [ Time Frame: 90 days] 
Study Hypot hesis Aim 1: The investigators hypothesize that there is non -inferiority in 
safety and efficacy between the different chest tube sizes  
Aim 2: Maximum barrier precautions associated with a decrease in 
empyema rate.

 Number of Patients  Aim 1: With a sample  size of n=[ADDRESS_775711] 80% 
power to detect a non -inferiority margin difference between the group 
rates of 8% (allowing up to a 15% rate of drainage failure in the small 
14 tube size group and approximately 7% in the large 28 tube size group; α=0.05). 
 
Aim 2: With assumptions of empyema rate is 5% in the retrospective 
group and 2% in the prospective group, 586 patients in each group are needed to achieve a power of 0.8 with α=0.05. To account for potential attrition, we will inflate t he numbe r of patients by 10% resulting in a 
total of 645 patients in the retrospective group and 645 patients in the 
prospective group.  
Inclusion Criteria  
1. The patient is admitted to the trauma service.  
2. The patient has a pneumothorax, hemothorax and/or 
hemopneumot horax, requiring thoracostomy tube placement. 
3. Thoracostomy tube placement is able to be performed or 
witnessed by [CONTACT_588999].  
4. The patient has not had a chest tube in the past year. 
5. The patient is > 18 years of age.  
6. In the event the patient is decisionally impaired, consent will be 
obtained from the individual’s legally authorized representative (LAR) or from the individual’s healthcare power of attorney (HPA). 
7. In the instance of reversible impairment, initial consent would be 
obtained from the LAR/HPA and the patient will be approached for 
consent once he/she is deemed mentally competent by [CONTACT_272785]. 
 
Exclusion Criteria  
1. The patient is incarcerated  
2. The patient is known to be pregnant  
3. The patient is hemodynamically unstable, requiring emergent chest tube placement (in <10 minutes from evaluation).  
4. The patient will have more than one chest tube placed at the time 
of enrollment.

Description of Study 
Intervention:   Placement of [ADDRESS_775714] Tube for 
Hemopneumothorax.  
Study Duration:   2 Years 
Randomization  Permuted block randomization with random block sizes to allocate 
patients in a 1:[ADDRESS_775715] 2017 
 
 
Page | 9 
 Statistical Analysis  Data Management:  
All prospectively collected subject data will be recorded in Research 
Electronic Data Capture application (REDCap) software, collecting 
insertion specific data including use of a thyroid drape, use of hand scrubbing, gown, mask, sterile gloves, and surgical cap. The chest tube indication will be collected in the REDCap generated survey. The data 
will be entered into the electronic database within 3 business days of the 
enrollment or follow- up visit. 
 
Statistical procedures for Analysis:  
All analyses for this randomized trial will follow the intention to treat principle with an additional per protocol analysis given the non-
inferiority hypothesis. We will first compare the baseline characteristics 
of the patients by [CONTACT_589000]. If either exists, these factors will be taken into 
account in sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes.  
The rates of failure of drainage (primary outcome) will be estimated as proportions and compared between the two groups using a Chi- square 
test corrected for the non -inferiority hypothesis. We will present the 
findings using the difference in the proportions (rate in small group –rate in large group) and corresponding 95% upper confidence limit.   
Length of stay will be compared using Poisson regression with a main effect of group . Post insertion pain and vital signs will be compared 
using analysis of covariance controlling for pre-procedural pain and 
vital signs, respectively, with categorical group effect. We will compare 
rates of re-intervention and readmission using chi- square tests for 
independence (or Fisher’s exact tests) and present our findings using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
An interim analysis for inferiority will be conducted at 50% and 75% information accrual. This comparison of the primary outcome, 
failure of 
drainage, will be compared between the treatment arms with a one- sided 
test for superiority of the 28 tube compared to the 14 (α=0.05).  
 There will be no missing data for the primary outcome as all information will be documented during surgery (no loss to follow up of the patient).

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 BACKGROUND  
  
Trauma is the leading cause of death for Americans ages 1 -44 and a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Tube thoracostomy fo r drainage of blood and/or air 
in the thoracic cavity is a common procedure for patients sustaining both blunt and 
penetrating thoracic trauma. Within the last ten years, smaller bore chest tubes (≤20 Fr) 
are being used with increasing frequency to treat these patients.2 Increasing evidence 
continues to show less pain and similar efficacy of the small- bore tubes3,4. Presently, size 
14 Fr catheters are routinely used for pneumothorax and occasionall y used for 
hemothorax. Kulvatunyou et al demonstrated no difference in efficacy between small and large bore (>20 Fr) chest tube size for the treatment of hemothorax. However, the study sample was small and usage of the small -bore catheters was selective. Data regarding 
complications of tube placement and removal, duration of thoracostomy placement, and complications from different tube sizes particularly in the setting of hemothorax is still lacking 
3,4. 
 
Catheter related bloodstream infections have been s uccessfully reduced using a bundle 
including maximal barrier precautions6. Literature regarding empyema rates and the use 
of maximum barrier precautions during thoracostomy tube insertion remains scarce. A well designed prospective study has yet to be developed to properly address the chest tube size in the setting of traumatic hemothorax/hemopneumothorax or empyema rates 
with the use of maximum barrier precautions

Page | 14 
  
In our previous retrospective study, we saw a decrease in empyema rates with 14  Fr 
catheters (small bore) for pneumothorax where the use of a large drape is standard of care 
for barrier protection. This prospective study, also seeks to determine the efficacy of the addition of maximal barrier precautions in the prevention of empyema for patients with 
hemothorax and/or pneumothorax (Aim 2).  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASS ESSMENT  
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIA L RISKS  
Some risks from the insertion procedure are:  
• Bleeding or infection where the tube is inserted  
• Improper placement of the tube (into the tissu es, abdomen, or too far in the chest)  
• Injury to the lung  
• Injury to organs near the tube, such as the spleen, liver, stomach, heart, or diaphragm 
• Infection 
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIA L BENEFITS  
  
• Drainage of blood, fluid, or air from around lungs, heart, or esopha gus.

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
  
The proposed study is a single center, prospective, non- inferiority trial evaluating the 
efficacy of small bore (14 Fr) vs large bore thoracostomy tubes in the setting of trauma at 
an American College of Surgeons designated Level I trauma center. Each patient will 
receive a study approved thoracostomy tube as indicated and our standard of care 
thoracostomy tube Practice Guideline will be followed. The study period is from the time of enrollment (visit day 0) up to 90 days (±14 days) following the date of thoracostomy tube placement. A total of [ADDRESS_775728] of a thyroid drape, hand hygiene, sterile gown, 
mask, and gloves. The use of sterile technique will be consistent throughout the 
prospective study. This will limit the variability between the two treatment arms and 
allow a more accurate comparison of empyema rates between tube size and sterile technique. The use of prophylactic antimicrobial agents will also be collected for these subjects. A total of  645 subjects will be e nrolled in this study group ( inclusive of those 
patients enrolled as part of Aim I ).  
All participants will be monitored for their need for operative intervention (e.g. VATS), development of empyema, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], tube related complications (e.g.  tube misplacement, tube migration), and death which occurs between thoracostomy tube placement and follow-up.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) ADMINIST RATION  
Screened subjects eligible for study participation will have their inclusion/exclusion 
criteria verified by [CONTACT_2413]. The subject will be approached for consent by [CONTACT_589001]. Subjects with suspected pneumothorax alone will receive either a small bore (14 Fr) or large bore (28 Fr) tube chosen based on physician preference. Subjects with suspected hemothorax or hemopneumothorax will be randomized to receive either a small or large bore chest tube.  
Enrolled subjects will have their thoracostomy tube placement procedure observed and verified by [CONTACT_589002]. The training level of the individual performing the procedure will be recorded. Maximum barrier precautions for this study will be used during the placement procedure for all prospective subjects. Maximum 
barrier precautions for this study will be defined as the correct use of proper hand 
hygiene, a cap, surgical gown, sterile gloves, mask, and a thyroid drape.  The institutional standard of care thoracostomy tube Practice Guidelines will be followed.  
 
 
6.2 INDEX HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_588992], baseline demographic and injury characteristics will be 
recorded. Baseline data to be recorded include:  
• Demographics (age, sex)  
• Vital signs (pre - and post-tube insertion) 
• Mechanism of injury (blunt vs penetrating) 
• Radiographic findings (pneumothorax, hemothorax or hemopneumothorax) 
• Initial laboratory values (hematologic panel, chemistry panel, coagulation panel, 
toxicology, blood gases) 
• Calculated injury severity score  
The day of tube insertion will mark study day 0. Subjects will be monitored daily by 
[CONTACT_589003][INVESTIGATOR_059]. A daily data log will be kept for each patient/ The information to be recorded includes: 
• Volume of hemo/hemopneumothorax drainage 
• Tube misplacement  
• Tube migration  
• Presence of air leak  
• Need for additional thoracostomy tubes

 • Need for operative intervention (VATS, thoracotomy)  
• Date and time of  pneumo/hemo/hemopneumothorax resolution as confirmed by a 
radiologist 
• Date and time of chest tube removal  
• Recurrent pnemo/hemo/hemopneumothorax 
• Development of infection 
 
6.3 THREE (3) MONTH FOLLOW -UP (DAY 90±14 ) 
 
Each participant will be followed for three months (90 days).  Participants will receive a 
telephone follow-up on day 90 (+/-2 weeks). Information obtained during the call will include: survival, adverse events and readmission to any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_588993] (e.g.  empyema, re-accumulation/recurrent pneumo- or 
hemothorax, fibrothorax).  
 
6.4 MEASURES TO MINI MIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZA TION AND 
BLINDING  
 
We will use stratified permuted block randomization with random block sizes to allocate 
patients in a 1:1 allocation to th e 14 or 28 tube sizes. The randomization lists will be 
generated by a study statistician using SAS Enterprise Guide version 6.1 and stratified by [CONTACT_157478] (Emergency Department and Surgical & Trauma ICU). Randomization lists will be provided to the study coordinator and another study team member not affiliated with clinical care and assessments to place the allocations into number opaque envelopes. These envelopes will be pulled sequentially by [CONTACT_589004] a patient is deemed provisionally eligible for the study preserving allocation concealment. The ID of the envelope is recorded in the patient’s  research record.

 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSM ENTS 
 
The rates of failure of drainage (primary outcome) will be estimated as proportions and 
compared between the two groups using a Chi -square test corrected for the non -
inferiority hypothesis. The margin of non- inferiority is defined as of 8%.  
 
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER  ASSESSMENTS  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_588994], enrollment 
(screening and randomization), implementation, protocol deviations, data collection, and adverse events. The biostatistics team will generate monthly reports for the study team 
which will monitor screening, enrollment, completeness of data for intervention implementation and outcomes, adverse events, and protocol deviations. 
 
A medical monitor will determine the course of action necessary to meet safety goals and objectives.  After the first 20 patients are enrolled and randomized, the study statisticians 
will generate a safety report for medical monitor review. An interim analysis for 
inferiority at 50% and 75% information accrual (see section 9.4. 4: Planned Interim 
Analysis) will also be conducted . The medical monitor will recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_588995].

 8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE E VENTS 
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
subject temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may 
or may not be related to the use of the medical treatment or procedures.   
 In this study, we will not be recording AEs  unrelated to thoracostomy tube size, as both 
of the thoracostomy tubes used in this study are being used within their approved 
indications.  
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., treatment, 
follow-up), that results in one or more of the following:  
• Death 
• Life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
In this study, we will only be reporting SAEs that are determined to  be unexpected and 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the size of the initial thoracostomy tube.  The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_588996].  
 
SAEs will be reported in the manner and timeframe that is ou tlined in the Chesapeake 
IRB handbook.  
8.3.3 SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0 developed by 
[CONTACT_7681]’s National Cancer Institute will be used as a severity scale for each AE and SAE. The general descriptions of severity for each adverse event is as follows:

Page | 26 
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention i ndicated; limiting 
age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self -care activities of daily living  
Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 Death related to AE  
 
 
8.3.4 RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
The principle investigator will assess the relationship of an adverse event to the thoracostomy tube insertion procedure or tube size will be the according to the following 
definitions: 
 
Unrelated  There is no evidence of any causal relationship  
Possibly related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship. However, the 
influence of other factors may have contributed to the event.  
Probably 
related There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely  
Definitely 
related There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other 
possible c ontributing factors can be ruled out.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_775739] for this study include: misplacement of tube, tube migration, death during insertion procedure, air leak, empyema, need for additional 
interventions (VATS, thoracotomy, chest tube replacement), catheter related blood stream infection and thoracostomy tube related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  For the purposes of this study, deaths will  be captured as clinical outcomes and do not need to be reported as 
SAEs unless determined by [CONTACT_589006].  
 All unanticipated problems that meet study definition will be reported to the IRB. An unanticipated problem is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incid ence

hypothesize the rate of drainage failure to be approximately 7% in the large 28 tube size 
group. With a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_775745] 80% power to detec t a non-
inferiority margin difference between the group rates of 8% (allowing up to a 15% rate of 
drainage failure in the small 14 tube siz e group; α=0.05). In our prior study, we saw a 
20% vs 6.7% difference in needing additional procedures for pneumothorax with small vs 
large catheters but these numbers are based on draining air not blood. Sample size 
analyses were conducted in PASS 139.  
 
Aim II 
Calculations of sample size were based on two -group comparisons of empyema rates. 
With assumptions of empyema rate is 5% in the retrospective group and 2% in the prospective group, 586 patients in each group are needed to achieve a power of 0.8 with α=0.05. To account for potential attrition, we will inflate the number of patients by 10% 
resulting in a total of [ADDRESS_775746] 2017

 9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF TH E PRIMARY E FFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
  
The rates of failure of drainage (primary outcome) will be estimated as proportions and 
compared between the two groups using a Chi -square test corrected for the non -
inferiority hypothesis. We will present the findings using the diffe rence in the proportions 
(rate in small group –rate in large group) and corresponding 95% upper confidence limit. 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF TH E SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S) 
  Length of stay will be compared using Poisson regression with a main effect of group. Post inser tion pain and vital signs will be compared using analysis of covariance 
controlling for pre -procedural pain and vital signs, respectively, with categorical group 
effect. We will compare rates of re- intervention and readmission using chi -square tests 
for independence (or Fisher’s exact tests) and present our findings using relative risks and 
95% confidence intervals.  
9.4.4 PLANNED INTERIM ANA LYSES 
  An interim analysis for inferiority will be conducted at 50% and 75% information 
accrual. This comparison of the primary outcome, fail ure of drainage, will be compared 
between the treatment arms with a one -sided test for superiority of the 28 tube compared 
to the 14 (α=0.05).

The IRB approved informed consent form (ICF) will adhere to ICH GCP guidelines and 
comply with the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations as detailed in 21 CFR §50.25 and the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Once eligibility has been confirmed, an investigator/research coordinator will approach 
each patient or legally authorized representative (LAR) to explain the nature of the study, 
its purpose, expected duration, alternative forms of therapy available, benefits and risks of study participation. Patients who are GCS = 15 will be approached prior to thoracostomy tube insertion for study consent. Patients with GCS <15 will either be consented by [CONTACT_589007]-consent if mentation normalizes within 24 hours of tube insertion. Where consent has been obtained from a LAR; the patient will be approached for consent if the investigator later deems the patient GCS = [ADDRESS_775748] patients/ LARs will be approached in either the emergency room 
or intensive care unit for consent. After this explanation and before enrollment, the 
patient or authorized legal representative will be given ample time and opportunity to read the consent form. Patients/LARs who choose to participate will voluntarily sign and date the form in the presence of the investigator/research coordinator. 
It will be pointed out to the patient/LAR that they can refuse to participate in the study or 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further care and treatment.  
The patient/LAR will be given a copy of the signed and dated informed consent form. The acquisition of informed consent will be documented in the patient’s medical records.  
Patients/LARs will be informed of any significant new finding  which arises during the 
course of study participation that may affect their decision to continue participation.

 12 APPENDICES  
12.1 APPENDIX A: TRAUM A PRACTICE GUIDELINE  
 
 
   
This guideline is a suggested approach and is intended to supplement rather than substitute, for 
professional judgment.  The care provider may change this plan depending upon clinical 
circumstances and available resources, but should clearl y document in the medical record the 
rationale for doing so.  Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.  
 
I. Purpose: To have a guideline for tube thoracostomy management and simple pneumothorax management. 
II. The indications for the placement of a chest tube include:  
a. Hemothorax or pneumothorax by [CONTACT_589010]. 
b. Prophylactic chest drainage in patients with severe blunt chest trauma requiring positive pressure ventilation.  
c. Clinically significant pleural effusions or other pleural collections.  
d. Evidence of subcutaneous air in chest and/or neck.  
III. Chest tube insertion  
a. A [ADDRESS_775759] line treatment. A large bore catheter (28F or greater) may be used accordin g to physician judgment.  
IV. Chest Radiographs  
a. Post insertion CXR for tube placement should be done routinely after insertion.  
b. A routine CXR (PA/Lateral) should be obtained after the chest tube has been removed. ANY development of respi[INVESTIGATOR_588998] .  
c. When placing the patient on water seal from suction, a routine CXR is not necessary.  
d. Consideration should be given for obtaining a CXR when placing to water seal for any patient who has had a recurrent residual pneumothorax.  
V. An abrupt decrease in chest tube output (>50% decrease compared to prior 24 hours output) may indicate that the chest tube is no longer functional.  Consider obtaining 
CXR to rule out significant re ‐accumulation of pleural fluid before discontinuing 
chest tube.

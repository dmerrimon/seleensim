(RBC s)during 
the 24-week period prior to randomizat ion, wi th a mean baseline hemoglo bin level  ≤10.0 g/dL .
A total o f approximately  [ADDRESS_573569] 48 weeks in the DBTP, up to 15 months in the Open -label Phase 
(OLP) andthe PTFP will be for [ADDRESS_573570] dose 
(whichever occurs later) to completethePost-treatment Follow -up Peri odunder this study  orthe 
rollover protocol .
End of Treatment for each individual subject is defined as the date of the last IP dose in the
DBTP or OLP , whi chever occurs later .
End of Study for each individual subject should occur after the study  is unblinded and the 
OLP , orthe PTFP have been completed, as appropriate or at the End of Trial as defined below ,
whichever occurs later.
The End of Trial is defined as the date all subjects complete the OLP , if eligible (see 
Secti on3.1.3 ), or discont inue earlier , or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last 
subject that is required for primary , secondary , and/or exploratory  analysis as prespecified in the 
protocol , whichever is the later date .

luspatercept, and/or complete thelong-term follow-up of [ADDRESS_573572] dose (whichever occurs later), to complete the Post -treatm ent Foll ow-up Peri od under 
this study  or the rollo ver protocol.
Study Treatments
Experimental arm. Luspatercept will be provided by [CONTACT_14547] a lyophilized powder in 
vial. Luspatercept will be administered after reconstitution (see Secti on 7)as a subcutaneous 
(SC) inject ion to the subjects by [CONTACT_292027]. Subcutaneous inject ions will 
be given in the upper arm, abdo men, or thi
gh, every  3 weeks during the Treatment Period s, 
unless dose delay  or treatm ent di scont inuat ion is indicated. Subjects will start luspatercept at 1 .0
mg/kg dose level and can be dose escalated up to 1.25 mg/kg.
Control arm. Placebo to be used in the study will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride 
for inject ion) administered as a SC inject ion.Designated individuals will prepare the placebo 
syringes to m atch the active syringe. Subcutaneous injections will be given in the upper arm, 
abdomen, or thi gh every  3 weeks during the DBTP , unless dose del ay or treatm ent 
discontinuat ion is indicated .
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments
The p rimary  efficacy  assessment will  include:
Hemoglobin values over a continuous 12- week interval fro m Week 13 to Week 24 of

SF-36 v2, LIC / ICT responder analysis , mean change in LIC, mean change in serum  ferritin, 
transfusio n-freeperiod, duration of mean hemoglobin increase , mean change in the 6MWT .
Interim Analysis :No interim analysis is planned.
Timing of Analyses: The primary  clinical study report (CSR) will include safet y and efficacy  
param eters wi th a cut -off date at the time when th e last subject enrolled in the DBTP has 
completed 48 weeks in the DBTP or discontinued earlier (ie, at the time of the unblinding of the 
study ),whichever occurs l ater. Thus, the analysis will be conducted after all required information 
is available for these endpo ints (ie, after all  subjects have com pleted 48 weeks in the study or 
discontinued earlier).
The final CSR will include efficacy and safet y data at the time of the End of the Trial (EOT 
definit ion in Sect ion3.3).

3.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, doubl e - blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, mult icenter study  to determine 
the efficacy  and safet y of luspatercept (ACE -536) versus placebo in adults with non- transfusio n
dependent beta ()-thalassemia. The study  is divided into the Screening Period, Double-blind 
Treatment Period (DBTP) , Open -label Phase (OLP) and Post -treatment Fo llow-up Peri od
(PTFP) .The overall study  design is described in Figure 7.
It is planned to randomize approximately 150 subjects at a 2:[ADDRESS_573593] ident ificat ion docum ent (ID)number will be allocated via the Interactive 
Response Techno logy (IRT
)system as detailed in Section 7.3.The Screening Period will last up 
to4weeks with an administrative window of + 3days to allow all laboratory results to be 
available at sitefor evaluating the subject’s eligibilit y.During the Screening Period, the subject 
will undergo safet y and other assessments to determine eligibilit y for the study  as detailed in 
Table 3,Table of Events.
If the subject received transfusions during the 24 weeks prior to randomizat ion, 24 weeks of 
transfusio n history  (including units or volume transfused and pre -transfusio n hemoglo bin level ), 
shoul d be recorded in the subject’s ele ctroni c case report form (eCRF) . If subject sreceived ICT 
during the [ADDRESS_573594] use history  (incl uding t ypes of ICT 
and doses) should be recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF).
Re-screening is allowed, and a
new subject ID number will be as signed (see Section6.1).
Subjects will be stratified at the time of randomizati on based on: 
1.Baseline hemoglo bin level: 
≥ 8.5 g/dL
< 8.5 g/dL
2.Baseline NTDT -PRO T/W score :
≥ 3points
< 3points
3.1.2. Double -blind Treatment Period
Subjects will enter the Double -blind Treatm ent Period (DBTP) once they  have com pleted the 
requi red assessments in the Screeni ng Peri od and been randomized via the IRT sy stem , as 
detailed in Sect ion 7.3.The DBTP will begin on Dose [ADDRESS_573595] discontinued earlier. At that time, the study  will 
be unblinded

within 3 days of randomizat ion (can be on the same day  as rando mizat ion).
Eligible s ubjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1, luspatercept versus placebo ,at a starting 
dose l evel of 1.0 m g/kg administered by
 [CONTACT_6567] (SC) inject ion once every  [ADDRESS_573597] supportive care is allo wed in both the luspatercept and placebo groups. This will include 
RBC transfusio ns, iron-chelat ing agents, use of antibiot ic therapy, an tiviral and ant ifungal 
therapy ,nutritional support as needed, and other medicat ions that are not prohibited (see 
Secti on8.2),thus minimizing the safet y risk to patients. Please,also refer to Section 8.1.2 for 
concomitan tmedicat ion for anemia, Section 8.1.3 for concomitant iron chelat ion therapy  use and 
Secti on 8.1.4 for concomitant RBC tra nsfusio ns.
Study  visit s and seri al measurements of safet y and efficacy  parameters will be perform ed as 
described in Table 3,Table of Events.
After the study  is unblinded , and after DMC’s recommendat ion
:
Subjects who received placebo and have been assessed as per protocol at least up to 
48weeks after the first dose of IP (even if the IP is discont inued before complet e 48 
weeks of treatment), may access the Open Label Period ( OLP )to receive luspatercept for
amaximum 15 monthsbefore m oving to the rollo ver protocol for longer treatm ent.
Subjects receiving luspatercept maycontinue their treatment in the OLP for maximum 
15monthsbefore m oving to the rollo ver protocol for longer treatment (ie,5 years fro m

designed as a daily electronic diary (eDiary) with recall of β-thalassemia related 
symptoms during the past 24 hours. The six items assess presence and severit y of 
each symptom using a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no) to 10 
(extreme). The sesix items are:
Tiredness (lack of energy ) when not doing physical act ivity
Tiredness (lack of ene rgy) when doing physical activit y

match the active sy ringe. All staff except unblinded pharmacists and designated personnel will 
be blinded .The m anufacturer’s di rections for placebo storage and handling are to be fo llowed, as 
are standard clinical pract ices for ensuring sterilit y of the placebo.
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
Luspatercept or placebo will be administered as a SC inject ion to subjects by [CONTACT_450164]’s source record.
Subcutaneous inject ions will be given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen. Calculated doses 
requi ring reconst ituted volume greater than 1.2 mL should be divided into two separate similar 
volume injections across 2separate body sites using the same anatomical locat ion but on the 
opposite sites of the body  (example left thi gh and right thi gh).The m aximum  volume per SC 
inject ion shoul d not exceed 1.[ADDRESS_573712] igator ’s
judgment, and the inject ions can be given in the following order as needed, for example: 1) right 
upper arm, 2) left upper arm, 3) right upper thigh, 4) left upper thigh.
In the DBTP, s ubjects will be assigned to be administered treatment a s per one of the following 
regimens:
Luspatercept starting dose level 1.0mg/kg SC every 21 days
Placebo SC every  21 days
In the OLP, subjects previously rando mized to receive placebo will be assigned to be 
administered l
uspatercept starting dose level 1.0 mg/kg SC every [ADDRESS_573713] assigned dose.

Confident ial and Propri etary 83 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun 2020Treatment Administration Criteria : 
On dosing days, the fo llowing cri teria must be m et to all ow the administrati on of  the IP at the 
same dose l evel:
1.Predose Hb ,measured on the dosing day (or, the day  before dosing )by [CONTACT_450165]
<11.5 g/dL (if predose Hb is ≥ 11.5 g/dL, check if subject was transfused wit hin 21 days 
prior to current dose and review the pre -transfusio n Hb , if this is < 11.5 g/dL, the subject 
can be dosed, otherwise, the dose shoul d be delayed . If the first dose of IP (ie, Dose 1 ) 
shoul d be administered ,the dose should be delayed until Hb is < 11.5 g/dL, if subsequent 
doses should be administered (ie,Dose 2, Dose 3, etc.) , the dose should be delayed until 
Hb is ≤ 11.0 ). Refer to Table 5, Dose Delay, Dose Reduction and Discont inuat ion 
Guidelines .

Increase of Hb < 2.0 g/dL compared to the Hb level on Day 1 of previ ous dose 
3.Absence of related adverse event ≥ Grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE criteria (Appendix 
C)on dosing day
4.Predose WBC count (corrected by  [CONTACT_450166]) < 3 x baseline and absence of 
leukocy tosis Grade 3 according to NCI CTCAE on dosing day .
5. Leukopenia, n eutropeni a and/or thrombocytopenia shoul d be < Grade 3, as per NCI 
CTCAE criteria
6.Nodecrease of > 2 g/dL Hb from baseline (uninfluenced by [CONTACT_231132] n)or subject

IMPORTANT REMINDERS :
The above treatment administration criteria numbers 2, 3, and 4should not be applied onDose 1
Day 1(except for the absence o f leukocytosis) forthe DBTP.
Hem oglobin not influenced by a transfusio n, defined as Hb ≥ [ADDRESS_573714] -transfusio n, should be 
considered to allow IP dose administration. If a transfusion occurred within 21 days prior to 
dosing, and predose Hb is ≥ 11.5 g/dL, the pre -transfusion Hb may  be considered for dosing 
purposes.
If IP dose is delayed due to Hb level not meeting the above dose administration criteria, the Hb 
level should be retested on a weekly  basis or at a frequency  decided by  [CONTACT_24342]. 
Subje cts m ust have Hb and WBC count assessed and results available prior to each IP
administration , therefore, l ocal laboratory  resul ts can be used . However, in the DBTP central 
laboratory  resul t will be used, when available, to confirm Invest igator’s decisio n,therefore, 
blood sam ples will  be also collected and shipped to the central laboratory ,as detailed in the

protocol  requi red schedule or frequency .Complete data about drug administration, including any 
overdose, regardless of whether the overdose was accid ental  or intent ional, should be reported in 
theeCRF . See Secti on10.1 for the reporting of adverse events associated with overdose.
7.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
The treatment assignment (randomization) will occur at the end of the Screening Period, once all 
the required screening procedures have been completed and all required data have been 
submitted to the Sponsor or its authorized represent ative. Upon receiving acknowledgment of 
subjects’ eligibilit y from the Sponsor or i ts authorized representative, subject can be assigned for 
treatm ent using IRT. This study  will utilize the IRT for rando mizat ion. 
Designated research personnel at each inve stigational site will be assigned password protected, 
coded i dentification numbers which allows them to access the IRT to enroll subjects. For drug 
assignment at each dose start and in the event of any  dose reducti on, dose escalati on si te staff 
must contac t IRTto record the new dose level and obtain the new study  treatment assi gnment.
The rel ationship of the rando mizat ion number to the subject ID number will be described by a 
rando mizat ion algorithm. The rando mizat ion algorit hm will be emplo yed by  [CONTACT_450170] a subject to a treatment based on the prespecified rules, such as double -blind study , 
stratified rando mizat ion withrandomizat ion rati o active v ersusplacebo on a 2:1; subjects will be 
placed into the appropriate stratum per the responses/ data entered/collected for questions 
collect ing stratificat ion and based on the combinat
ion of these data points, the IRTwill place the 
subject in the next available slot within the appropriate stratum for that subject. The IRT will be 
utilized to ensure an equal weight central rando mization based on block randomizat ion method 
according to stratificat ion factors defined in Secti on3.1, Desi gn of  Stud y. The rando mizat ion 
number corresponds to a particular treatment arm within a stratum. The rando mizat ion number, 
by [CONTACT_5071], will not unblind a user to the subject’s treatment. The randomizat ion number should be 
coupl ed wi th all the unblinded code informat ion, in order the subject to become unblinded.
7.4. Packaging and Labeling
The l abel(s) for luspatercept will include Sponsor name, address and telephone number, the 
protocol  number, IP nam e, dosage form  and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per 
container, lot number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_11313] (where applicable), m edicat ion ident ificat ion/kit number, 
dosing instructi ons, storage condit ions, and required caution statements and/or regulatory 
statements as applicable. Addit ional information may  be included on the label as applicable per 
local regulati ons.
7.4.1. Blinding
For thi s trial, all subjects, study  site staff ,and Ce lgene Corporation representatives with the 
exception of designated individuals (eg, the pharmacist at the invest igational site), will  remain 
blinded to all treatment assignments until all subjects enrolled in the study  have completed 48 
weeks of double -blind treatm ent or di scont inue before reaching 48 weeks of double -blind 
treatm ent, whi chever is the earlier date, or at the time the study  is unblinded (per DMC 
recommendat ion) and the data base is locked.

Confident ial and Propri etary 88 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun 2020The designated site individual (for example the phar macist) at the invest igational site will use a 
syringe (that exactly matches the syringe used for reconst ituted luspatercept) and sterile normal 
saline (0.9% sodium chloride for inject ion) to prepare a matching placebo. Thus, the designated 
site individual at the invest igational site will  be unblinded and will give Invest igators and their 
staff luspatercept and placebo in a blinded manner.
Randomization, drug dispensing, dose reduction/escalat ion, and drug discontinuation will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_73294]. Authori zed si te personnel must contact [CONTACT_450171], study  drug assignment at the beginning of each cycle, to register dose reductions 
or escal ations, and treatment discont inuat ion. Confirmation o f each call will be sent to the 
investigat ional si te and Celgene.
For em ergency unblinding ,refer to Secti on12.2.
7.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal 
Accountabilit y for study  drug that i s administrated during the course of the study  is the 
responsibilit y of the Investigator or designee. Investi gational clinical supplies must be received 
by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secure and temperature -controlled 
location.The invest igational site must m aintain accurate records demonstrating dates and 
amounts of study  drug received, to whom  it was administered (subject -by-subject accounting), 
and accounts of any luspatercept accidentally or deliberately destr oyed or returned. Accurate 
recording of all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section o f the subject’s eCRF
and source documents. Unless otherwise notified, all vials o f study  drug, both used and unused, 
must be saved for drug accountabilit y.The used vials may be discarded, per the inst itution’s 
standard practice, after drug accountabilit y has been co mpleted by  [CONTACT_941] m onitor.The Invest igator 
must return all unused vials o f study  drug to the Sponsor at the end of the study , or the study  
drug may be destroy ed at the clinical site wit h the permission o f the Sponsor. For ei ther scenario, 
the outcom e must be docum ented on the drug accountabilit y log.The Sponsor will provide 
direction for the outcome of all unused vials.
Celgene (or desi gnee) will review wi th the Invest igator and relevant site personnel the process 
for invest igational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilit ies for the 
site versus Celgene (or designee).
7.6. Investigational Product Compliance
Study  drug will be administered as a SC injection at the clinical site by [CONTACT_39802].
Moni toring for pati ent com pliance wi th the treatment regimen is therefore unnecessary .
Accurate recording o f all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section o f the 
subject’s eCRF and source documents.
The Investigator or designee is responsible for accounting for all IP that is administered during 
the course of the study .

Confident ial and Propri etary 91 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun [ZIP_CODE]. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
9.1. Overview
The proposed Phase 2study  is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, mult icenter 
study  to determine the efficacy and safet y of luspatercept (ACE -536) versus placebo in adult 
NTDT subjects. The study popul ations, study  endpoints, and statistical plan arediscussed below.
9.2. Study Population Definitions
Study  popul ations to be analyzed are defined as fo llows: 
Intent -to-treat (ITT): The ITT populat ion will consist of all rando mized subjects regardless o f 
whether or not the subject received IP.
Per Protocol Set (PPS): Subjects in the ITT who have taken at least 1dose of IP and do not 
have major protocol deviat ions (details will be specified in the SAP prior to database [DB]lock).
The PPS popul ation might be used in addit ion to ITT population to analyze primary and 
secondary  endpo ints as detailed in the SAP.
Safety: The safet y populati on will  consist of all  subjects who were randomized and received at 
least 1dose of IP. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they  
actually received.
QoL Evalua blePopulation : The QoL evaluable populat ion consists of all subjects in the ITT 
popul ation who completed the health -related QoL assessment at baseline (screening) and at least 
one postbaseline assessment visit.
Statistical methods to handle missing data will be described in the SAP. The SAP will also 
describe detailed rules for data handling and analysis (eg, time windows, visit -by-visit analysis, 
endpo int analysis, protocol deviat ions).
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Based on the assumption o f a targeted primary endpoint response rates at least 50% in the 
luspatercept group and 10% for the placebo group, and 2:1 randomization, a total sample size of 
150 
(100 in the luspatercept group, 50in the placebo group) will have at least 99% power to 
detect the difference between the 2groups with a 2- sided alpha of 0.05 and assumed 10% drop -
out rate.
For NTDT -PRO T/W domain scores, assume the mean change fro m baseline scores at Week [ADDRESS_573724] ical power will be 91%.
Randomization and Stratification
Subjects will be rando mized to receive luspatercept or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. Randomizat ion will 
be acco mplished by [CONTACT_450172]. A stratified block 
rando mizat ion schedule will be implemented. Randomizat ion will be stratified by :

deviat ions will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions.
9.6. Efficacy Analysis
Primary analysis will be done after ALL subjects completed 48 weeks or discont inued earlier. 
Then at the end of the OLP phase, updated safet y and efficacy analysis will be done.
9.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of t his study is erythro id response, defined as an increase fro m 
baseline ≥1.0 g/dL in mean of hemoglo bin values over a continuous [ADDRESS_573725] 1 week apart within 4 weeks before Dose 1 .For discontinued subjects who do not complete 
24 weeks of the Double -blind Tr eatm ent Peri od, Hb data will continue to be collected (see 
Table 3). 
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be performed on the ITT populat ion. Cochran -
Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test will be performed wit h randomizat ion stratificat ion factor(s) in the model 
to com pare the treatment and placebo groups at 2 -sided 0.05 level; the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval for odds rati owill also be provided .
For a su bject, if the Hb average over Weeks [ADDRESS_573726] Hb 12- week average will be used.

Week 24(+7 days) , he/she will be considered as non-evaluable .Similar approach will be 
followed for Hb secondary endpo ints over Weeks 37 to 48 .
9.6.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis
The analyses of keysecondary  efficacy  endpoints will be performed on the ITT populat ion. The 
three key  secondary  endpoints are as follows:
1) Mean change fro m baseline in NTDT -PRO Ti redness and Weakness (T/W) domain score 
over a continuous 12- week interval fro m Week 13 to Week 24. 
2) Mean change fro m baseline in mean of hemoglo bin values over a c ontinuous 12

interval  from Week 13 to Week 24 in the absence of transfusio ns.
3) Proporti on of  subjects who have an increase from baseline ≥1.0 g/dL in mean of 
hemoglo bin values over a continuous 12 -week interval from Week 37 to Week 48 in the absence
of transfusio ns.
To control  the overall Type 1 error rate for three key  secondary  endpoints, the testing procedure 
will be implemented strictly in order: after the result from the primary efficacy analysis in the 
ITT populat ion shows statist ical significa nce, the key secondary endpo int [ADDRESS_573727] resul ts for primary  endpoint and the key  secondary  endpoints 1 and 2 are all significant. 
The details o f the multiplicity control  will be specified in the SAP.

Confident ial and Propri etary 101 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: [ADDRESS_573745] igator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
10.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any  AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (i e, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE);
Requi res inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24508] 
(hospi [INVESTIGATOR_208838] n, regardl ess of l ength of stay );
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions);
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect;
Const itutes an important medical event.
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208839]:
a standard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on.However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208840] a com plicat ion of therapy  administrati on will be 
reported as an SAE. 
routi ne treatm ent or m onitoring of the studied indication not associated with any  
deteri oration in condit ion.
the administration o f blood or pl atelet tran sfusionsas a routine treatment of the 
studi ed indicat ion.However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450116] a 
complicat ion of such transfusio n rem ains a reportable SAE.
a procedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, surgery , scans, e ndoscopy , 
sampling for laboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208840] a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE.

unrelated to the studied indicat ion, that has not worsened fro m baseline. 
emergency outpati ent treatm ent or observat ion that does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/ Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/ intensity of the event. 
The severit y/intensity of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms accordi ng to the 
current active minor versio n of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, 
Versi on 4.0); 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc_40
AEs that are not defined in CTCAE should be evaluated for s everit y/intensity according to the 
following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical  
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be 
need ed; no or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy  required
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n is possible
Grade 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation i n activit y, significant assistance 
requi red; significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_372087]
Grade 5 =Death -the event results in death
The term  “severe ”is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific ev ent (as in mild, moderate ,
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe sam e as “serious”which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or funct ioning.
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic

Confident ial and Propri etary 103 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun 2020intervent ions, or underlying condi tions provi de a sufficient 
explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship betw een the IP and 
the adverse event.
Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently available 
inform ation.Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspe cted of  being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a r ecord of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, di scont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if 
concomi tant and/or addi tional treatm ents were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study;
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity oris an exacerbat ion or worsening o f an exist ing 
condi tion.
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. If the abnormalit y was not

Confident ial and Propri etary 104 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun 2020a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the la boratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply  as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing 
potenti al or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events.
10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential:
Females of childbearing potential (FCBPs) are advised to avoid beco ming pregnant during study 
and for [ADDRESS_573746] dose of IP. Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including 
elevated βhCG or posi tive pregnancy  test in a femal e subject of childbearing potential regardless 
of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP , or wi thin [ADDRESS_573747] ’s last dose 
of IP, are considered immediately  reportable events. Invest igational product is to be discontinued 
immediately . The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy  test m ust be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  by [CONTACT_6968] , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form , or approved equivalent form.
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician- gyneco logist or another appropriate 
healt hcare professio nal for further eva luation.
The Investigator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy  and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  about the outcom e of the pregnancy  (either norm al or 
abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy  Follow-up Report Form  orapproved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Invest igator 
shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any o f the seri ous 
criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celg ene Drug Safet y by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within [ADDRESS_573748] igator’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report 
Form , or approved equivalent form .
All neonatal  deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_573749] igator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y by 
[CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 ho urs of the Investigator’s knowledge of the

Confident ial and Propri etary 105 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun 202010.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. All SAEs m ust be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y within [ADDRESS_573751] igator ’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], 
or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form.This instructi on pertains to init ial SAE r eports as well as any  follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This 
requi rement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relatio nship to IP) that occur during the study  
(from the time the subject signs informed consent unt il [ADDRESS_573752] dose of IP in the 
DBTP and/or OLP ) or any  SAE m ade known to th e Invest igator at any time thereafter that are 
suspected of being related to IP. Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after 
signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_27598]. If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
perform ed, copi [INVESTIGATOR_348863]. Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safet y.
Where required by [CONTACT_81689], the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant 
initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_208843] h Celgene and the IRB/EC.
10.5.1. Safety Queries
Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be co mmunicated fro m Celgene Drug Safet y to the si te via 
facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is expected to be no m ore than five (5) business 
days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causalit y assessment) m ay be handled by [CONTACT_648].
10.5.2. Thromboembolic Events
The occurrence of a thromboembo lic event will be monitored as an event of interest and should 
be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study . 
Invest igators are to report the occurrence of thromboembo lic events as SAEs to Celgene Drug 
Safety within [ADDRESS_573753] dose (whichever occurs later) .

Confident ial and Propri etary 106 ACE -536-B- THAL -002 Amendment 2 Final: 12 Jun 2020Events of new malignancy , premalignant lesio ns (excluding benign tumors or benign neoplasia) 
are to be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y within [ADDRESS_573754] igator’s knowledge of the 
event by  [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Rep ort Form , or approved 
equivalent form and must be considered an “Important Medi cal Event ”even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the e CRF and 
subject’s source documents. Docum entati on of  the diagnosed m alignancy must be provided at 
the time o f reporti ng as a serious adverse event ( eg, any  confirmatory  histol ogy or cy tology 
resul ts, x-rays, CT scans, etc.).
Malignancies or cancerous tumorsare lesions capable of invading into adjacent tissu es, and may  
be capable of spreading to distant tissues. A benign tumor has none of those properties.
Malignancy  or cancer is characterized by [CONTACT_292049], invasiveness, and metastasis.
Prem alignant or precancerous lesio ns refer to a state of disordered morph ology of cells that i s 
associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of cancer. If left untreated, these condit ions may lead to cancer. 
Such condit ions are usually eit her dy splasia or benign neoplasia (and the dividing line between 
those is sometimes blurry). Somet imes the term  “precancer ”is used to describe carcino ma in 
situ, whi ch is a noninvasive cancer that has not progressed to an aggressive, invasive stage. Not 
all carcino ma in situ will progress to invasive disease.
Prem alignant l esions are m orphol ogically at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_450117], and in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparent ly 
norm al counterpart.
10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events

12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products (Emergency 
Unblinding)
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study  unless in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the 
Invest igator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it is medically  imperat ive to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discont inued if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of 
the Invest igator, continuing IP can negat ively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.
The decisio n to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibilit y of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by [CONTACT_1034]. However, the Investigator may
contact [CONTACT_81695], mainly in the 
interest of the subject. 
The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only  in accordance wit h the protocol. The 
Invest igator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency  unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by [CONTACT_81696]’s source documentation.

The immune system distinguishes “self” from “non -self,” and targets “non- self” for elimination. 
This process forms the basis of our immunity to pathogens and the primary barrier to organ 
transplantation. Cancer, however, is neither “self” nor “non -self,” but rather “altered- self” and 
evades detection and elimination by [CONTACT_465249]. The ultimate goal of cancer immunotherapy is to target and reverse these tumor -induced 
immunosuppressive processes, allowing the activated immune system to eradicate the cancer and develop immunologic memory to combat future recurrences before they become clinically apparent  (1
). 
Radiotherapy has been a primary oncologic therapeutic modality for approximately a century, and it was recognized prior to 1950 that in rare circumstances, radiation of a single tumor 
resulted in regression of not only the irradiated tumor, but also regression of distant tumors  not 
irradiated.  This phenomenon was termed “The Abscopal Effect.”  Contemporary preclinical 
work from various tumor immunology groups have demonstrated that the abscopal effect is mediated by [CONTACT_27639]  (2, 3
). 
1.2 Biologic Rationale for Combining Immunotherapy and Stereotactic Radiotherapy  
Stereotactic radiotherapy  (SRT) , in which large radiation doses per fraction are given, has 
been combined with immunotherapy to potentiate the abscopal effect of radiotherapy ( 1). A 
recent review describes the biologic rationale for combining immunotherapy and SRT. Tumor 
cells can downregulate major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) expression to avoid 
immune system detection ( 4). One possible mechanism of the abscopal effect of radiation is 
upregulation of MHC I expression after radiation, which eliminates tumor cells’ ability to evade 
immune detection via this pathway  (3, 5, 6). Radiation also increases the quantity o f tumor -
specific antigens for immune presentation  (7). However, upregulation of MHC I expression and 
increased antigen supply are insufficient – activated T cells must be present to recognize and 
kill the tumor cells  (1, 6). 
Both cytotoxic T lymphocyte -associated protein 4 ( CTLA -4) inhibitors, by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_007] T cells 
activated for longer periods, and programmed death receptor -1 (PD-1) or programmed death -
ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, by [CONTACT_465250] T cells, can potentiate the abscopal 
effect of radiotherapy. However, a documented mechanism of tumor resistance to CTLA -4 
inhibition is upregulation of PD- 1 acti vity ( 8). Preclinical work has shown that PD -[ADDRESS_596756] of radiation therapy  (9, 10), and that tumors can increase PD -1 
activity after radiotherapy  (11). Correspondingly, a documented mechanism of tumor 
resistance to PD -1 inhibition is downregulation of MHC I expression ( 1). Therefore, the 
combination of SRT and PD -[ADDRESS_596757] treatment responses than either individually  (9, 11-15). In murine melanoma and 
mam mary carcinoma models, SRT augmented the response of combined PD- 1 and  
CTLA -4 inhibition, even in cell lines previously resistant to CTLA -4 inhibition ( 8). 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  13 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/[ADDRESS_596758] 5 years, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab 
(PD-1 inhibitors), atezolizumab and durvalumab (PD -L1 inhibitors),  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (a CTLA- 4 
inhibitor) have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with advanced solid tumors, first in melanoma (16-21
) and subsequently in non- small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) , renal cell 
carcinoma  (RCC) , squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck  (SCCHN) , and bladder cancer 
(22-36), among others , leading to approval by [CONTACT_3133] ( FDA) for 
their use in these cancers with additional indications expected in the near future . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_465230], the majority of cancers  progress 
on PD -[ADDRESS_596759] published case reports of patients who were failing immune checkpoint immunotherapy until they received SRT to a single lesion, after which regression of the 
irradiated lesion as well as lesions outside of the radiation field with attendant changes in molecular markers of immune activation was observed ( 1, 37, 38
). Similarly, radiotherapy to 
oligo -progressive metastatic lesions has been shown to prolong the efficacy of tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors in lung cancer  (39, 40 ). These reports have fueled a growing area of clinical 
investigation into the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy.  
1.[ADDRESS_596760] been shown to be effective in patients with melanoma that has previously 
progressed on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ( 41-43). In a three -arm phase 3 trial comparing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (a CTLA -
4 inhibitor), nivolumab (a PD -1 inhibitor), and dual immune therapy in treatment- naïve patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, nivolumab demonstrated superior  response rates 
and progression- free survival  compared to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] ( 44). These results were replicated with 
pembrolizumab compared to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (45). 
PD-1/PD -L1 inhibition  and CTLA -[ADDRESS_596761] different 
mechanisms of action ( 46). Since  PD-[ADDRESS_596762] inhibition has demonstrated superior 
response to CTLA -4 inhibition in melanoma ( 18, 44 ) and has proven effective in multiple 
cancer histologies after progression on CTLA -4 inhibition  (8, 41-43), we have decided to 
pursue the combination of PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibiting therapy and SRT rather than CTLA -4 
inhibiting therapy and SRT. The toxicity profile of PD -1 inhibition appears to be more favorable 
than that of CTLA -4 inhibition (44). Should our initial study  demonstrate favorable outcomes, 
then the combination of SRT and dual immune therapy could be evaluated in a subsequent 
study , given the excellent responses of dual immune therapy seen in melanoma.  
Although both classes of immune therapy have approval in melanoma,  PD-[ADDRESS_596763] 
FDA a pproval for use in NSCLC, RCC, and SCCHN, with additional indications expected in 
the near future. Also, the PD -L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, has been approved by [CONTACT_465251] #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  14 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  treatment of metastatic  urothelial carcinoma, with additional indications expected in the near 
future . Therefore , the use of PD -1 and PD -L1 inhibitors , instead of CTLA -4 inhibitors , expands 
the eligible population  now in this study and in the future . 
1.5 Inclusion of Multiple Advanced Solid Tumors  
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting therapy has demonstrated efficacy in multiple tumor types. Similarly, the 
abscopal effect has been seen in multiple tumor types  (47-57). By [CONTACT_465252]-[ADDRESS_596764] demonstrated 
efficacy in brain metastases  (58, 59
), and the combination of SRT and PD -1 inhibitors in the 
treatment of brain metastases has been shown to be safe  (60, 61). Additionally, the reduced 
blood brain barrier seen in brain metastases suggests that radiotherapy to these lesions offers 
a similar, if not identical, chance for immune reactivation compared to radiotherapy to 
extracranial sites  (62).  
Our radiation oncology group is not comfortable with observing intracranial disease given the potential for these lesions to quickly cause debility and/or death. Therefore, patients with brain 
metastases will be included in this  study provided all brain lesions can be  treated with SRT 
and there is extracranial measurable disease that can be observed.  Given the limited data on 
the immunogenicity of brain metastases, enrollment of patients who receive SRT to brain 
metastases alone will be limited and their data analyzed separately.  
1.[ADDRESS_596765] of the recent  clinical trials evaluating the combination of SRT and immunotherapy are 
enrolling patients who are naïve to immunotherapy, and recently published studies in 
melanoma, prostate cancer, and other solid malignancies investigated immunotherapy -naïve 
patients  (8, 63-65). However, in the seminal case report detailing the abscopal effect in a 
patient with metastatic melanoma, the patient, who had previously responded to ipil imumab 
but was progressing on immunotherapy, received SRT to a painful paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_465231]  (37). 
To date , no studies have prospectively examined combination therapy in patients with tumors 
that have progressed on prior immune checkpoint inhibiting therapy, recreating the conditions 
described in prior case reports . In this clinical trial, SRT and immunotherapy  will be combined 
to treat patients who have had disease control  from immunotherapy  but did not continue to 
improve.

measurements to assess response. In this study,  the feasibility of using volumetric 
measurements of tumor size will be explored. 
1.9 Evaluation of Immunologic Correlates Using Blood Samples  
1.9.1  Significa nce and Background 
The mechanisms underlying radiation therapy ( RT)-induced antitumor immune 
responses are complex, but are likely related to secretion of certain immunostimulatory 
cytokines and chemokines, systemic immune response against tumor antigens, 
systemic signaling by [CONTACT_465253], and local inflammation 
contributing to a distant effect  (66). For example, serum IFN -γ levels were found to 
increase in a dose- dependent fashion in patients with esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma who were treated with RT alone. Type I interferons (IFN -α and IFN -β) not 
only play important roles in the immune responses  to viral infection, but are also 
actively involved in anti tumor  immunity  (67). RT can induce production of Type I 
interferons through activation of intracellular DNA sensors, such as the STING -
dependent pathway  (68, 69). Induction of Type I interferon within the TME is required 
for generation of Type I interferon -dependent innate and adaptive antitumor immunity 
by [CONTACT_465254] -priming capacity of tumor -infiltrating antigen -presenting cells, 
such as dendritic cells, as  well as recruitment and effector function of CD8+ T effector 
cells (70, 71). 
Exosomes are small (30 –150 nm) vesicles containing unique RNA and protein cargo, 
secreted by [CONTACT_465255]. They are also found in abundance in body fluids 
including blood, saliva, and urine ( 72-74). Interest towards exosomes, from their 
function in the body to more practical applications, such as the use in diagnostics (based on analysis of their miRNA and protein content) and therapeutics development, has grown exponentially in the last 5 years  (
75). With the current advances the analysis 
of exosomal miRNA from biological samples such as blood is more feasible than ever before. Furthermore, the cargo contained in exosomes provides an enriched population 
of miRNA free of endogenous RNA contaminants such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) . 
Therefore, these exosomes contains a disease -specific miRNA signature, which is very 
attractive for diagnostic purposes  (
76-78). 
Investigators have also examined the interactions of cancer -derived exosomes with 
primary T -lymphocytes  (79-82). For example, previous studies have demonstrated that 
these cancer -derived exosomes induce apoptosis in CD8+ T- lymphocytes through the 
FAS/FASL pathway. Other studies have demonstrated that tumor -derived exosomes 
up-regulate expression of inhibitory genes in conventional CD4+T  cells and their 
conversion into CD4+ CD25high FOXP3+ CD39+ Treg  (83, 84), which co- expressed  
IL-10 and TGF- β, CTLA -4, granzyme B/perforin and effectively mediated immune 
suppression. 
RT can also induce extensive immunogenic alterations of dying and surviving cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment. The resulting stress and death of tumor cells 
could stimulate tumor -specific immune responses through the liberation of ‘danger’ 
signals or damage -associated molecular patterns, together with tumor -associated 
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  16 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  antigens. Specialized antigen- presenting cells can capture tumor antigens and 
concurrently activate the ‘danger’ signals by [CONTACT_465256], such as toll -like receptors on the surface of immune cells  (85, 
86). The resultant antigen presentation can potentially lead to recruitment and priming 
of T cell s and consequent immune- mediated destruct ion of tumors and/or metastases  
(87). 
1.9.2  Preliminary Studies  
The VCU Department of Radiation Oncology has an on going blood draw study (HM -
[ZIP_CODE])  collecting blood samples from patients receiving RT with curative intent  for 
cancer of the thorax (lung, breast, prostate, rectal, cervical , head and neck) . We have 
published a preliminary analysis of retrospective patient blood samples collected for 
single -nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in genes encoding HO -1, eNOS, NRF2 and 
TGF- β1 (87). NRF2 is a transcription factor for HO -1 expression and NRF2 knock -out 
mice are sensitive to radiation- induced lung injury  (88). We also analyzed position -[ADDRESS_596767] for racial differences in the response of tissues to radiation.  
In a preliminary study (Serrano et al, in preparation) , exosomes were isolated from the 
plasma of patients  with lung cancer  on HM1 2181 the day before RT started, 3 weeks 
into RT and 6 months after the end of treatment ( Figure 1 ). Exosomes from patients 
with recurrence isolated [ADDRESS_596768] the potential for exosomal biomarkers of tumor recurrence after therapy.

The relative expression levels of 10 different miR s selected on the basis of their roles in 
lung cancer  were also determined: let -7a-5p, miR -20a-5p, miR -21-5p,  
miR- 30b-5p, miR -106a- 5p, miR -146a- 5p, miR -155-5p, miR -200b -5p, miR -203a, and 
miR- 208a- 5p. Expression of 6 miRs demonstrated significant difference between 
recurrent and non -recurrent groups of lung cancer patients  (Figure 2 ). Results are 
shown as an average of mi Rs expression (Cq- values) for recurrent ( 3 patients) and 
non-recurrent (3  patients) lung  cancer  before, during, and [ADDRESS_596770] to plasma volume. I f the Cq-values  are converted  into fold differences,

  Version Date: 12/19/[ADDRESS_596772] for miR measurement.  
For functional analysis of exosomes , we will determine whether exosomes isolated 
from cancer patients as described above induce apoptosis of activated CD8+ T  cells 
isolated from anonymized blood samples purchased from a local blood bank  (79-82). 
Additional experiments will test whether tumor -derived exosomes mediate immune 
suppression by [CONTACT_465257]4+ T cells and their 
conversion to CD4+CD25highFoxP3+CD39+ Treg cells expressing IL -10, TGFβ, CTLA -
4, and granzymeB/perforin ( 83, 84). Experiments described above in Figure [ADDRESS_596773] not had progression of disease, but who 
may still benefit from radiation. Some situations when this would be appropriate include but 
are not limited to : 
• Metastatic  sites that, if left to grow , would cause clinical issues but are currently 
asymptomatic , such as spi[INVESTIGATOR_465232] 
• Metastatic sites that are causing symptoms such as pain, neurological changes, shortness of breath, hemoptysis , or rectal bleeding 
• Oligoprogressive metastasis in which most of the metastatic sites have responded to immunotherapy but one or more has grown larger. 
Recent studies indicate that the combination of the immunotherapy drugs  and SRT is well 
tolerated , with toxicity similar to monotherapy  (89-91
). Preliminary results also indicate the 
presence of abscopal response in non -irradiated measurable lesions with concurrent 
pembrolizumab( 90). Another study suggested that the addition of RT to immune therapy could 
“allow for a prolonged  response to immune checkpoint inhi bition ” (92).  
Given the apparent  low risk of combining immunotherapy with SRT, we have elected to 
expand the study population beyond those patients who have responded to and then 
progressed on immunotherapy, to include patients who have demonstrated disease control 
with immunotherapy but are no longer continuing to improve.  In these cases, radiotherapy may 
provide improved disease control and symptom management. We will continue to explore the potential synergistic interactions of the immune -mediated abscopal  effect with  the anti -PD-
1/PD -L1 activity of the allowed immunotherapy drugs.

6 STUDY TREATMENT  
6.1 Baseline Tests and Procedures 
Refer to the study calendar in Section 12 for requirements prior to initiation of study treatment . 
The tumor (s) anticipated to receive SRT (and at least one tumor that is measureable and will 
not be treated with SRT) and disease to be monitored should be identified using assessments 
completed prior to starting SRT. 

MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  25 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  6.2 Summary of Study Treatment  
• Patients will receive a standard treatment regimen of SRT (refer to Section 6.3). The term 
SRT encompasses  all radiotherapy using a stereotactic setup,  both stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) for metastatic lesions in the brain and stereotactic body radiotherapy 
(SBRT) for SRT delivered to all other locations.  Regist ered patients will be designated as 
belonging to subgroups as follows:  
A. Patients  receiving SBRT (body) irradiation only  
B. Patients  receiving SBRT and SRS (body and brain) irradiation 
C. Patients  receiving SRS (brain) irradiation only  
• The s ame PD-[ADDRESS_596790]  SRT fraction (on the same day)  and will continue to be given according to the 
schedule the patient was receiving prior to study registration through [ADDRESS_596791] SRT fraction. At the investigator’s discretion, administration of the PD -1 or PD -L1 
inhibitor may continue during Year 2 or longer (refer to Section 6.4 for additional 
scheduling information). 
• At the treating medical oncologist’s discretion, one dose of PD- 1 or PD -L1 inhibitor may be 
given after  study registration but prior to receiving SRT.  
• All doses of the PD-[ADDRESS_596792].  
6.3.1  Radiation Oncology Department  
All study patient s will receive SRT in the MCC Radiation Oncology Department . 
6.3.2  Dose Specifications  
• Treatment will be planned to deliver a total of 18 to 60 Gy to the planning target 
volume (PTV) in up to 10 fractions over 1 to 2 weeks . 
• The dose per fraction is to be prescribed so that at least 95% of the PTV receives the prescription dose.  
Note : Metastases in different locations may be treated to different doses in the same 
patient.  
6.3.3  SRT Treatment Schedule 
• SRT must begin within [ADDRESS_596793] SRT fraction.  
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  26 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  • The dates of computerized tomography ( CT) simulation, start of RT, and completion 
of RT must be documented.  
• The timing of treatment initiation should be coordinated with admini stration of the 
PD-[ADDRESS_596794] SRT 
fraction.  
6.3.4  Treatment Planning 
• Planning Constraints  
Planning constraints are provided in this section for both the PTV as well as critical 
normal structures to be spared. Acceptable treatment plans will be established from 
a DVH- based analysis of the volumetric dose to both the PTV and critical normal 
structures to ensure that minimally acceptable constraints for each volume of interest have been met.  
• Planning Techniques  
Planning techniques may differ for each lesion to be treated provided that the tumor motion is properly accounted for with each technique when the target or targets are 
in or near the thorax region.  
• Planning SRT Near Prior Radiotherapy Volumes  
The toxicity of delivering SRT to multiple metastases in close pr oximity to prior 
conventionally -fractionated external beam RT volumes is not known. Every effort 
should be made to limit the dose to organs at risk  that have previously received 
radiation.  
6.3.5  Technical Factors  
• Megavoltage equipment capable of delivering static intensity modulation with a 
multileaf collimator or dynamic intensity modulation, using a multileaf collimator or 
tomotherapy, is required.   
• Daily image guidance is required. This can take the form of electronic portal 
imaging, orthogonal KV imaging, or cone beam CT.  
6.3.6  Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization 
• A custom immobilization device is suggested to minimize set -up uncertainty.  
• CT-based simulation (maximum 3 mm slice thickness) is required.  
6.3.7  Target Volumes and Contouring 
• The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as all known gross disease as determined 
from a combination of clinical and radiographic examination. 
• The internal target volume (ITV) is defined as all regions that are likely to harbor 
microscopic metastatic disease based on location and histology of the tumor and 
other involved sites  as well as compensation for tumor motion. 
• Normal structures should be contoured according to consensus guidelines such as Radiation Therapy Oncology Group contouring atlases, if available, or according to 
other commonly accepted contouring guidelines.  
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  27 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  • The PTV wi ll provide a margin around the ITV to compensate for the inter - and intra -
fraction uncertainty consequent to daily set -up uncertainty and to potential internal 
organ motion. Depending on the site of the treated lesion and the immobilization 
technique used, the PTV will consist of a symmetrical 1- 5 mm expansion around the 
ITV. In the event that PTVs extend outside of the skin surface, the clinician should 
manually trim the PTV contours to be 3 -5 mm inside the outer skin (unless there is 
direct skin involvement ). 
6.3.8  Critical Structure Constraints  
• Critical structure constraints will be specified according to the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group (AAPM TG101) report (93
). In the event that 
constraints for the number of fractions used are not listed in the report, dose 
constraints will be linearly interpolated from TG101 constraints.  
• Use TG101 as a guide for dose limits to normal tissue. At a minimum, no organ at 
risk should receive greater t han 105% of the prescription dose.  
• In the event that a critical structure is encompassed in the PTV, the area of overlap will be limited to 105% of the prescription dose. 
6.3.9  Metastasis Location Definition for Treatment Planning 
Each metastasis targeted with SRT will be assigned to one of the 8 “Metastasis Locations” as described in this section.

 (eg, 
PTV_5000_2 is a peripheral lung lesion receiving 50 Gy  while PTV_5000_4 is a liver 
lesion receiving 50 Gy). If multiple lesions exist within a single anatomical site, each 
lesion can be distinguished by [CONTACT_1583] a letter to the end of the PTV name  
(eg, PTV_5000_1a and PTV_5000_1b). Brain lesions can also include an anatomic 
descriptor (eg, PTV_2700_8a_ left parietal).

An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life -threatening AE, 
An AE is consider ed to be “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
Planned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], eg, for planned surgery, or those that occur for 
logistical reasons, eg, to complete a therapy that cannot be completed due to 
outpatient clinic business hours, are exempt from SAE reporting. Events that

been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• suggests that the research places patient s or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
8.1.4  AE Description and Grade 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE v 5.0 will be utilized for 
AE reporting.  
8.1.5  AE Expectedness  
AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’.  
• Expected AEs are those AEs, the specificity and severity of which, are listed or 
described in the current version of the FDA-approved prescribing informa tion for the 
specific PD -1 or PD -2 inhibitor . 
• Unexpected AEs are those AEs occurring in one or more patients p articipating in the 
study , the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either:

MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  46 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS  
13.1 Study Design 
This is a single -arm phase 2 study of SRT and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibiting therapy for 
patients with advanced solid tumors who achieved disease control  during PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibiting therapy . The primary objective is to determine if SRT can restore the benefit of 
PD-1 or PD -L1 inhibiting therapy in patients with an advanced solid tumor who had disease 
control  from PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibiting therapy but did not continue to improve. For patients 
enrolled with progression, this would mean SD, PR, or CR. For patients enrolled with 
stable or plateaued  disease, restoration of benefit would be an objective response, ie PR 
or CR.  
13.2 Sample Size and Accrual Rate  
Given that only approximately 10% of patients who continue PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibition after 
progression  or plateau on a prior PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibiting agent  experi ence improved 
disease control ( 18, 45, 98 ), we would consider an improved disease control rate of 25% 
(relative to 10% of patients  who do not receive radiotherapy ) with the combination of SRT 
and PD-[ADDRESS_596817] 80% power at 
5% level of significance. We anticipate that 10% of enrolled patients may be inevaluable; 
therefore, up to [ADDRESS_596818] 14 
evaluable patients and no more than 11 of the 37 evaluable patients. Patients who receive 
SRT to other sites as well as to brain metastases will not be counted towards this allotment.  
Accrual is anticipated to be about 1 patient  every 1 -2 months over a period of about 4.5 
years.  
13.3 Statistical Analysis of Primary Objective  
We will employ a Simon two- stage design to assess for treatment futility  by [CONTACT_465265] 24 weeks  following completion of SRT . Therefore , 14 
patients will be eval uated for the primary endpoint (ie, improved disease control) at [ADDRESS_596819] stage, all primary and secondary endpoints will be summarized and 
shared with the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC). If the study goes into the 
second stage of accrual, this will be the interim analysis. If early termination of the study is 
recommended, this will be the final analysis .   
MCC Protocol #:  MCC -16-[ZIP_CODE]  47 Version #: 5 
  Version Date: 12/19/2018  The rate  of im proved disease control will be reported with a point estimate and 95% 
confidence interval.  Analysis of the primary objective will include all efficacy -evaluable 
patients; however, a subset analysis of efficacy- evaluable patients who only receive SRT 
to brain metastases will  also be performed.  
13.4 Statistical Analysis of Secondary Objectives 
Patients’ demographics, AEs and SAEs, disease status, treatment status, clinical 
response, etc will be listed and summary descriptive statistics will be calculated. Rate of 
higher grade AEs will be reported at each follow -up visit.  
Time to death, time to progression at the irradiated site, and time to progression at a  
non-irradiated site will be summarized using the Kaplan Meier survival curve. Overall 
survival  probabilities  will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals at each follow -up time 
point during the 2- year follow -up. Analysis of the secondary objectives will include all 
evaluable patients; however, a subset analysis of evaluable patients who only receive SRT 
to brain metastases will  also be performed.  
13.[ADDRESS_596820] one  dose of PD-1 or 
PD-L1 inhibiting therapy after SRT  will be evaluable for safety and toxicity analyses . 
13.5.2  Efficacy- Evaluable Population 
Patients will be evaluable for analysis of the primary endpoint if they meet all of the following criteria: 
• Received at least 50% of the prescribed SRT 
• Received at least one  dose of PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibiting therapy after SRT 
• Had baseline and at least one subsequent response assessment to measure the 
SRT-treated tumor and the non- SRT-treated tumor following the last dose of 
SRT as follows:  
• Patients with documented unequivocal progression of disease prior to 
the 24 -week time point will be evaluable.  
• Patients who do not have documented unequivocal progression of 
disease prior to the 24- week time point and have not  had an objective 
response assessment at the 24 -week time point will not be evaluable 
for efficacy and will be replaced.

Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] [ADDRESS_1049321] goal achievement after a 
change in antidepressant medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD). 
4.2 Secondary Objectives  
To determine the effectiveness of treatment wit h vortioxetine on depressive symptoms/outcomes, 
clinical global impression,  cognitive impairment , and quality of life in subjects with MDD.  
4.3 Additional Objectives  
• To determine the effectiveness of treatment with vortioxetine on cognitive performance and 
functionality in subjects with MDD.  
• To determine the effectiveness of treatment with vortioxetine on work performance in 
subjects with MDD.  
• To determine the effectiveness of treatment with vortioxetine on general health status  and 
well-being in subjects wi th MDD. 
• To assess health care utilization and the safety and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects 
with MDD.  
4.4 Study Design  
This study is an open -label, single -arm, multicenter, prospective, phase 4, interventional, flexible 
dose study (as per the Trintel lix US package insert) to determine the effectiveness of treatment 
with vortioxetine on subject goal achievement after a change in antidepressant medication for the 
treatment of MDD.  
This study is comprised of a 3 -week Screening Period (maximum 21 days), t o be followed by a 
12-week Treatment Period and a 4 -week Safety Follow -up Period. Study visits will occur at 
Baseline (Day 1), and Weeks 2, 4 (Telephone), 6, 9 (Telephone), and 12. This study will enroll 
approximately [ADDRESS_1049322] previously been treated within 6 weeks of Screening or are 
currently being treated for a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (MDE) with an approved antidepressant 
for 6 weeks or longer at an adequate dose. Subjects who are dissatisfied with their current or 
recent antidepressant and are interested in a change in antidepressant treatment will be eligible 
for Screening.  
The change in antidepressant medication will be based on the investigator’s judgment in 
collaboration with the subject’s level of dissatisfaction with their current or recent antidepressant 
treatment (ie, residual mood symptoms, intolerable side effects). Subjects also need to be eligible

CONFIDENTIAL  per the Trintellix US package insert and sign and date a written, informed consent form and any 
required privacy authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures.  
The investigator or the investi gator’s designee will access the Interactive Response Technology 
(IxRT) at Screening to obtain the subject study number . At the Baseline Visit, i f the subject has 
satisfied all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion  criteria for enrollment, th e subject 
will be enrolled using the IxRT. Subjects will be instructed on when to take the first dose of 
study drug. The dosing (both initial and adjustments) will be determined by [CONTACT_765448]. Subjects will 
determine treatment goals with their clinicians using the Goal Attainment Scale ( GAS) adapted 
for an MDD population. The subject and clinician will work to establish [ADDRESS_1049323]’s self -defined objectives. Two goals will be 
selected from the following predefined categories representing MDD residual symptoms, 
antidepressant side effects, and common reasons for a change in antidepressant medication, 
including but not l imited to:  
MDD Domains  Psychological  Motivation  Emotional  Physical/ 
Functional  Cognition  
Predefined goal 
categories:  -Depressed mood 
-Anxious mood  -Lack of 
motivation  -Low self 
esteem 
-Anhedonia  -Fatigue 
-Insomnia  
-Muscle 
tension  
-Sexual 
dysfunction  
-Weight gain  -Problems 
concentrating  
-Short term memory 
problems 
-Difficulty staying 
focused  
-Difficulty paying 
attention 
-Problems thinking 
clearly 
 
A prepopulated list of categories will be provided in the structured guidance for goal assessment, 
including behavioral examples describing goals and observable benchmarks to help clinicians set 
the appropriate goals with subjects. Goals will be set at Bas eline/Visit 1. Progress will be 
evaluated at the Week 6 visit. At the Final Visit the goals will be assessed based on levels of 
achievement on a 5 -point scale. Investigators will be trained on goal setting/goal assessment and 
monitored for ability in key d omains of goal setting (eg, attainability of goals, use of observable 
objectives and benchmarks, equidistance of scaling, general level of difficulty, goal 
differentiation, and overall quality).  
A safety follow -up phone call will be made [ADDRESS_1049324] dose o f study medication.

CONFIDENTIAL  Enrollment caps may be implemented throughout the course of the study based on the patient 
reported outcome (ie, Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9) and Perceived Deficits 
Questionnaire -Depression ( PDQ-D)) scores at Baseline.  
A futility analysis will be performed at an interim analysis with approximately 60 subjects 
completing Week 12.   If the futility analysis indicates that the study should be discontinued, the 
final analyses will be conducted for all enrolled subjects.  Details for the futility analyses are in 
the Interim Analysis section of this SAP. 
Figure 4.a Schematic of Study Design  
 
(a) Recommended starting dosage is 10 mg/day as ideal dosage. Dosage may be decreased to 5 mg/day at discretion 
of the investigator or designee.  
(b) If all screening activities are completed and the subject meets the eligibility criteria the Screening and Baseline 
Visits can be combined into 1 visit.  
(c) Subjects currently on an antidepressant a t Screening will be discontinued in a manner that is consistent with 
labeling recommendations and conventional medical practice prior to Baseline.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.0 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
As no formal hypothesis testing is performed for the primary endpoint, the purpose of sample 
size estimation is to determine the adequate sample size needed to provide a precise estimate for 
the response rate (GAS Score ≥50) with 95% CIs.  
Conservatively e stimating that 50% of subjects will be responders (GAS >50) and that 100 
subjects will complete the study, CIs will be [PHONE_15972] around the point estimate (proportion of 
responders).  
  
Vortioxetine -4003 Page 14 of 26 
Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] [ADDRESS_1049325] dose of study switch 
medication.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS® Version 9.2, or higher.  
All confidence intervals, statistical tests, and resulting P -values will be reported as 2 -sided and 
will be assessed at α=0.[ADDRESS_1049326] deviations (SDs) will be presented to [ADDRESS_1049327] dose of the 
vortioxetine medication. Other study days are defined relative to the Study Day 1 with Day 1 
being Study Day 1 and Day -1 being the day prior to Study Day 1.  
7.1.2    Definition of Visit Window  
 
The window definitions as stated will be applicable for all the summaries where study visit data 
is presented  and where study visit data are compared with baseline data . The window 
conventions for safety and efficacy parameters are consecutive; that is, the lower  or upper bound 
of the windows is the midpoint between [ADDRESS_1049328] date to the scheduled visit date will be used. In the event of 2 observations 
within a given visit window being equidistant to the scheduled visit date, the l ater observation 
will be used.

Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] 15 February , 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.2 Analysis Sets  
In this study, 3 kinds of analysis sets are defined: f ull analysis set (FAS), per protocol set (PPS) 
and safety analysis set.  
The FAS, used for primary effectiveness analysis, will include all subjects who wer e enrolled in 
the treatment period and received at least [ADDRESS_1049329] to follow -up, study termination, 
pregnancy, lack of efficacy, voluntary withdrawal, and other.  
A summary of screening failures and listings of inclusion/exclusion criteria responses for 
subjects with violations will also be provided.  
7.4 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will be listed and summarized for demographics (sex, ag e, race, and body 
mass index), and medical history  for the safety analysis set . 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using mean, SD, median, maximum and minimum values.  
7.5 Medical History and Concurrent Medical Conditions  
Medical history refers to the significant co nditions/diseases that stopped at or prior to signing of 
informed consent. Concurrent medical conditions are those significant ongoing 
conditions/diseases present at signing of informed consent.  
Medical history and psychiatric history and concurrent medica l conditions will be coded using 
the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be 
  
Vortioxetine -4003 Page 16 of 26 
Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] 15 February , 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  summarized in tables using System Organ Class (SOC) and MedDRA preferred term. The table s 
will include number s and percentages of subje cts and will be sorted in alphabetical order by 
[CONTACT_6657]. A subject will only be counted once within a particular 
class even if he/she has multiple conditions/symptoms. Summaries will be based on the safety 
analysis set.  
All medical history and concurrent medical condition data will be presented in listing s. 
7.6 Medication History and Concomitant Medications  
The medication history and concomitant medications are defined as follows:  
• Medication history refers to the medication that the study subjects stopped taking within 
30 days prior to signing of informed consent (ie, stop date < informed consent date).  
• Concomitant medication is defined as medication that the study subjects continued taking or 
took from signing of informed consen t through end of study:  
– Concomitant medication that started and stopped prior to baseline (ie, stop date 
≥ informed consent date, and stop date ≤  first dose date).  
– Concomitant medication that started prior to and was ongoing at baseline (ie, start date 
< first dose date, and stop date >  first dose date)  or if coded as ongoing with no stop date.  
– Concomitant medication that started after baseline but before or at last dose (ie, start date 
≥ first dose date, and start date ≤  last dose date).  
– Concomitant medica tion that started prior to and was ongoing at baseline or that started 
after baseline (ie, start date ≤  last dose date, and stop date > first dose date.  
– If start date and stop date are missing, medication will be assumed to occur both prior and 
concomitant ly. 
Medication history and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest version of the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary and summarized by [CONTACT_765449],  with therapeutic class and 
medications in each class sorted in alphabetical order. The total number of subjects with 
medications in each selected therapeutic class will also be presented. If a subject reports taking 
2 drugs belonging to the same class, he /she will only be counted once within that class . 
Summaries of medication history and concomitant medication will be based on  the safety 
analysis set.  
All prior and concomitant medications data will be presented in listing s. 
7.7 Study Drug Exposure and Compli ance 
The summary of study drug exposure and compliance will be based on the safety analysis set.  
Duration of exposure to study medication is defined as (date of last dose – date of first dose +1). 
Treatment duration will be summarized by d uration category in weeks (1 to 2 weeks , 3 to 4 
weeks, 5 to 6 weeks, 7 to 8 weeks,  9 to 10 weeks, and 11 to >12 weeks) and the number and 
  
Vortioxetine -4003 Page 17 of 26

CONFIDENTIAL  percentage of subjects in each duration category . Treatment duration (days) will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  
Percent of study drug compliance is defined as {(number of tablets dispensed – number of tablets 
returned)/(date of last dose – date of first dose +1)}x100%. If a value for the number of returned 
tablets is missing or the return date is missing, then 100%  compliance will be assigned for each 
day up to the number of tablets dispensed or up to the date of return whichever is earlier.  
Study medication compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_345714] (<80%, 80 to 120%, 
and >120%) and the number of subjects in each compliance category. Study medication 
compliance will also be summarized as a continuous variable using descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  
All study drug admi nistration and accountability data will be listed by [CONTACT_765450]. The following variables will be listed: subject identifier, visit number, first and last dose 
dates, medication identification number, date dispensed and returned, number o f tablets 
dispensed and returned, and percent compliance.  
7.[ADDRESS_1049330] goal achievement after changing antidepressant medication for treatm ent 
of MDD. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who changed to treatment with 
vortioxetine and achieved their individually identified goals as demonstrated by [CONTACT_765451] ≥[ADDRESS_1049331], standardized scoring 
is applied to allow for statistical analysis.  
The GAS allows for 1 of 2 types of goals to be set:  
(1) Subject defined goals  allow a “subject’s chief complaint” approach taken towards 
establishing the goal, with no specific limitations set for the type or focus of the goal, 
beyond requiring that it meets the basic standards of measurability, equidistance, and 
difficulty.  
(2) Domain-defined goals are more structured in nature, presenting the subject with an array 
of broadly defined domains and more specific subdomains. After selecting an appropriate 
domain and (where applicable) subdomain, the clinician will work with the subject to 
establish a specific goal that fits within the selected category.  
For GAS, a total of [ADDRESS_1049332] goal -setting at the outset of the study.

Termination Visit (as applicable) to determine the level of progress a t that time, with assignment 
of appropriate scores . It takes subjects approximately 45 minutes to complete the GAS.  
 
Calculating the Overall GAS  
 
The goals identified are incorporated into the single GAS score  by [CONTACT_2931] a formula:  
 
 
Overall GAS =  50+ 10∗∑(𝑤𝑖𝑥𝑖)
√(1−𝜌)∑𝑤𝑖2+ 𝜌(∑𝑤𝑖)2   
 
Where: 
wi = the weight assigned to the ith goal (if equal weights, w i = 1) 
xi = the numerical value achieved (between –2 and + 2)  
 = the expected correlation of the goal scales   
(For practical purposes, most commonly approximates to =0.3) 
 
For this study, a choice of weight is based on importance of the goal.   Weight is 1,  2, and [ADDRESS_1049334] important goal s, respectively. The expected 
correlation of 0.3 was selected for this study.  
 
The GAS will be summarized for both  Week  6 and Week 12 using both percents of response 
and as a continuous score.  An overall GAS score greater than 50 is considered as a response.  
 
7.8.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint( s) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PHQ-[ADDRESS_1049335] 2 weeks. Each question is rated on a sca le from 0 (not at 
all) to 3 (nearly every day). If any problems are answered 1 or higher, a final question on how 
difficult those problems made it to do work, take care of things at home, or get along with other 
people is completed rated from not difficult  at all to extremely difficult. The 9 questions are 
summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 27 with higher scores reflecting greater severity. It

CONFIDENTIAL  takes approximately 5 minutes to complete the PHQ -9.  The total score for the PHQ -9 is 
analyzed as a continu ous variable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PDQ-D 
The PDQ -D, a validated version of the original PDQ specifically modified to depressed patients, 
will be used to evaluate self -reported cognitive complaints in patients with MDD. The PDQ was 
originally developed to assess cognitive compl aints in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, 
it does address cognitive aspects highly relevant for depression, including attention and 
concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning and organization. It 
takes approximately 10 minutes to complete the PDQ -D.  The score from the PDQ -D is analyzed 
as a continuous variable.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Global Impression Scales  
The CGI was developed to provide global measures of the severity of a patient ’s clinical 
condition during clinical studies. The CGI scales consist of 2 subscales: the CGI -S and the CGI -
I.  CGI-S and CGI -I raters will be required to have suitable experience and training (as deemed 
by [CONTACT_3211]) to be eligible to rate subjects  within the study. The total time to score the CGI is 
approximately 1 to 2 minutes after the clinical interview.  
CGI-S 
The CGI-S is a clinician rated scale designed to assess global severity of illness and change in 
the clinical condition over time. The CG I-S provides the clinician’s impression of the patient’s 
current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient 
population to rate the severity of the patient’s current mental illness on a 7 -point scale ranging 
from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).  The CGI-S is 
analyzed as a continuous variable.  
CGI-I 
The CGI-I assesses the subject’s improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess 
the subject’s condition re lative to Baseline (Randomization/Day 1) on a 7 -point scale  ranging 
from 1 (much improved) to 7 (much worsened) . In all cases, the assessment should be made 
independent of whether the rater believes the improvement/worsening is drug -related or not.  The 
CGI-I is analyzed as a  continuous variable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Q-LES-Q 
The Q-LES-Q is a scale designed to allow researchers to assess the degree of a subject’s quality 
of life in various areas of daily living. Ninety -one of the 93 items are assembled into 8 
categories: physica l health/activities, feelings, work, household duties, school/course work, 
leisure time activities, social relations, and general acti vities. The items are grouped according to 
these categories and the i tems are each scored on a 5 -point scale, from 1 (not at all or never) to 5 
(frequently or all the time), to indicate the degree of enjoyment or satisfaction experienced.

Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] [ADDRESS_1049336] version of MedDRA. In this dictionary, each 
verbatim term is coded to a lower level term, and then mapped to a preferred MedDRA term, 
which is then mapped to an SOC. All adverse events from the safety analy sis set will be included 
in the data listings but only treatment -emergent adverse events will be included in the summary 
tables.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that 
occurs after receiving study drug (AE start date ≥ first dose date) and within [ADDRESS_1049337] dose of study drug (AE start date – last dose date ≤30). Adverse events with 
onset occurring more than [ADDRESS_1049338] dose of study drug (AE start date – last dose date 
>30) will be listed, but not included in the summary tables. Adverse events with missing onset 
dates will be summarized regardless of severity and relationship to study medication.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) with onset that occurs after receiving study drug (AE start date 
≥first dose date) and within [ADDRESS_1049339] dose of study drug (AE start 
date - last dose date ≤30) will be summarized.  
In the high -level adverse event summary tables, TEAEs will be summarized regardless of 
intensity and re lationship to study drug. Within each subject, multiple reports of events that map 
to a common MedDRA term will be counted only once for calculating incidence rates.  
At the adverse event level, the summary tables will present the number of subjects report ing each 
of these MedDRA events, ie, the number s of subjects reporting [ADDRESS_1049340] counts across all adverse events within that SOC.  
In selected summaries (TEAEs overview, and TEAEs by [CONTACT_9315]), adverse 
events will be s ummarized by [CONTACT_765452].  
For the summary of TEAEs by [CONTACT_2946], preferred term and maximum intensity, if a subject 
experiences more than [ADDRESS_1049341] will be counted 
only once by [CONTACT_765453][INVESTIGATOR_1865] (preferred term). Similarly, if a subject has 
more than [ADDRESS_1049342] will be counted only once by [CONTACT_765454] -4003 Page 23 of 26 
Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] [ADDRESS_1049343] relationship to study drug.  
The following summaries will be presented:  
• Overview of TEAEs during the study  - number and percentage of subjects , number of events.  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_119298] - number and percentage of subjects.  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_765455] (male and female) - number and percentage of 
subjects. 
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_765456] - number and percentage of subject s. 
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_2946] - number and percentage of subjects.  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_11702] - number and percentage of subjects.  
• Intensity of TEAEs by [CONTACT_9315] - number and percentage of subjects.  
• Relationship of TEAEs by [CONTACT_9315] - number and  percentage of subjects.  
• Drug-related TEAEs by [CONTACT_9315] - number and percentage of subjects.  
• TEAEs leading to study discontinuation by [CONTACT_9315] - number and percentage 
of subjects.  
• Treatment -emergent Serious AEs by [CONTACT_63302] - number and percentage of 
subjects. 
• Most Frequent(>=5%) Treatment -emergent Non -serious AEs by [CONTACT_9315] - 
number and percentage of subjects.  
• Pretreatment Events by [CONTACT_119298] - number and percentage of subject s. 
SOCs will be sorted in alphabetical order. Within an SOC, adverse events will be sorted in 
descending order of total number of subjects with the preferred term.  
All adverse events will be presented in listing. Special listings for TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation, SAEs and deaths will also be presented.  
7.9.2 Vital Signs  and Weight  
Vital signs and weight at scheduled visits and their changes from Baseline will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765457]. The number and percentage o f subjects with 
  
Vortioxetine -4003 Page 24 of 26 
Statistical Analysis Plan [Ver 2.0] [ADDRESS_1049344] -Baseline MAV  from vital signs during the  treatment period will be presented for 
each variable over all visits. A listing of MAVs for vital signs will also be presented.  
The criteria for identification of MAV vital signs ar e given in Appendix A. 
7.9.3 Other Observations Related to Safety  
The C-SSRS Baseline/Screening will be administered at Screening and the Since -Last-Visit C-
SSRS will be ad ministered at all other time points. The C -SSRS was developed by [CONTACT_765458] a tool to help systematically assess suicidal ideation and behavior in 
subjects during participation in a clinical trial of centrally acting drugs. The C -SSRS is 
composed of [ADDRESS_1049345]. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete the C -SSRS.  
7.10 Interim Analysis  
The responder rate based on GAS score >=50 will be calculated. The conditional probability of a 
responder rate of less than 50% at 120 su bjects will be assessed ; that is, using the data /trend of 
60 patients at the interim look, the probability of (responder rate < 50%) at the end of study (i.e., 
120 subjects) will be calculated.     
In addition, the change in PHQ9 and PDQ will be evaluated for internal decision making.  
The report to be prepared for the interim analysis should include the tables for the following: 
demographics, disposition, GAS Response percents, GAS change from baseline, PHQ -9, and 
PDQ-D.   
The end of the study will be the date of the last safety follow -up visit of the last subject based 
either on the first 60 completed subjects or the final 120 completed subjects.

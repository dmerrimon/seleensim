Adverse Event (AE): Any negative experience that a participant has during the course of a clinical trial, 
including new or worsening symptoms or laboratory abnormalities. 
Belmont Report: A document entitled "Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human 
Subjects of Research" that was produced by [CONTACT_357418] 1978. The Belmont Report identifies three fundamental ethical 
principles for all human subjects' research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. · 
Blinding: When research participants are unaware of the assigned "treatment." In a single-blinded trial, the 
subjects do not know what treatment they are receiving. In a double-blinded trial, the subjects AND the 
investigators are unaware of the treatment assigned, as are the monitors and statisticians in some cases. 
Case Report Form (CRF): A record of information collected on each subject during the clinical trial. 
Clinical Investigation: A systematic trial designed to evaluate a test material in humans. 
Clinical Research: A trial in human subjects. 
Clinical Trial: Any prospective investigation in which the applicant or investigator determines the method 
of assigning the test material or other interventions to one or more human subjects. 
Declaration of Helsinki: A series of guidelines adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Assembly in Helsinki, 
Finland in 1964. Recommendations include the procedures required to ensure subject safety in clinical trials, 
including informed consent and Ethics Committee reviews. 
Ethics Committee: An independent group of medical and nonmedical people who verify the integrity of a

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): Legislation passed in 1996 th~t 
includes a privacy rule creating national standards to protect personal health information. 
Inclusion Criteria: A list of requirements that a subject must meet to be eligible to participate in a 
research trial, as specified in the protocol. 
Informed Consent: The verification of a person's willingness to volunteer in a research trial. The 
verification is requested only after the person has received complete, objective information about the 
research, including its objectives, potential benefits, risks and inconveniences, alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_357397] (if applicable), and the subject's rights and responsibilities in accordance with the current 
revision of the Declaration of Helsinki (as amended). Consent is given by [CONTACT_357419] (ICF). . 
Institutional Review Board (IRB): An independent group of professionals designated to review and

to the FDA if they choose to do so, and to provide feedback to the health professional commun ity as new 
safety information becomes available. 
Monit()r: The Sponsor or CRO representative who reviews trial records to determine that it is beinq

generated are accurate. · .· 
~ (t: ; ' 
Randomization: A method of assigning trial test material such that each subject has an equal chance of

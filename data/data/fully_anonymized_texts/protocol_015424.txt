1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
This will be a multi -center, open -label, randomized study that directly compares 
the use of cyclosporine and plasma exchange to corticosteroids and plasma 
exchange as the initial treatment of patients with thrombotic th rombocytopenic 
purpura.  This study has the following objectives:  
 
Primary Objective  
 
1.[ADDRESS_752024] to:  
 
 exacerbation rate within [ADDRESS_752025] -PE 
 clinical response rate  
 number of exchange p rocedures to achieve clinical response  
 relapse rate (recurrent disease >[ADDRESS_752026] PE)  
 safety data for CSA as an adjunct to PE.  
 the effects of corticosteroids vs. cyclosporine on ADAMTS13 antigen, activity, 
and ADAMTS13 antibody concentration and inhibitor titers using serial 
measurements both during and after discontinuation of study drug  
 the VWF multimeric patterns after initial therapy and throughout longitudinal 
follow -up between the two treatment arms  
 the laboratory biomarker(s) that are prog nostic for TTP exacerbation and the risk 
of relapse  
 
2.[ADDRESS_752027] been tremendous advances in our knowledge and understanding of 
the pathophysiology  of TTP since Drs. Amorosi and Ultmann character ized the pentad 
of findings (fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic, 
and renal findings) in a 1966 review of all 271 previously reported cases. (1)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_572861], splenectomy, and heparin, 
TTP was almost uniformly fatal with 90% o f patients dying from the disease.  Following 
observations of clinical improvement with plasma -based therapy, clinical trials soon 
demonstrated an 80 -90% remission rate. (2)  Rock et al reported one of the only 
randomized clinical trials in TTP and were able to demonstrate the superiority of 
 - 3 - therapeutic PE over simple plasma infusion in the acute treatment of TTP. (3) Based 
upon this study, PE is considered the standard of care of acute TTP.   
 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_572862], complications related to 
the central venous catheter (infection, hemorrhage, and pneumothorax) and the plasma 
infusion (hypersensitivity, volume depletion, and transmission of infe ction) may be 
associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Howard et al recently updated their 
experience with PE for TTP at the Oklahoma Blood Institute, reporting roughly a third of 
patients experienced significant complications from PE and a 2. 4% mortality rate .(4)  
More importantly, approximately 50% of patients with idiopathic or acquired TTP will 
suffer a recurrence of the  disease after tapering plasma exchange, requiring repeated 
exposure to the risks of PE therapy. (5)  These historical data were confirmed by [CONTACT_572872] 60% of patients required the re -initiation 
of plasma -based therapy within 30 days of discontinuing PE therapy. (6) 
 
2.[ADDRESS_752028] -mortem examinations 
described microthrombi in multiple organs of the body, including the heart, kidneys, 
adrenal glands, and the brain. (1)  The etiology of the microthrombi was not k nown, but 
the findings were fitting with the clinical presentation and course of the patients.  In 
1982, Moake et al were able to demonstrate that some patients with TTP had unusually 
large multimeric forms of vWF, similar to those stored in vascular endot helial cells and 
platelets, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_572863]. (7, 8)   Given the finding that these 
forms disappeared with the acute presen tation of TTP and reappeared in patients after 
remission, it was hypoth esized that these highly active multimers of vWF were central to 
the pathogenesis of the microthrombi seen in TTP.  It was postulated that a vWF 
“depolymerase” was responsible for the conversion of unusually large multimers of vWF 
to the smaller multimers that are usually found in the circulation. (9)  In this scenario, the 
unusually large multimers of vWF would spontaneously react with platelets resulting in 
the platelet thrombi in the microvasculature.  It was also hypothesized that an antibody 
inhibitor of the “d epolymerase” could account for the unusually large multimers seen in 
the plasma based upon reports of patients with chronic relapsing TTP being controlled 
with immunosuppressive therapy. (10)  The subsequent identification of a  specific 
protease (11, 12)  that was shown to cleave purified human vWF as well as the finding 
that patients with TTP had deficiencies of protease function further strengthened the 
hypothesis.  Furlan et al went on t o describe both a familial form of TTP who had a 
constitutional deficiency, as well as a non -familial form due to an inhibitor of the vWF -
cleaving protease. (13)  This protease, now known as ADAMTS13, was recently purified 
and the gene localized to the long arm of chromosome 9. (14, 15)   
 
2.3 ADAMTS13 A ctivity and Inhibitors in Idiopathic TTP  
Initial reports correlating ADAMTS13 activity with the clinical diagnosis of acquired TTP 
showed greater than 70% of patients with idiopathic TTP to have a severe deficiency of 
protease activity (< 5%) with the majo rity having demonstrable antibody inhibitors of the 
 - 4 - protease. (13, 16, 17)   Autoantibody inhibitors of ADAMTS13 are now recognized to be 
central to the pathophysiology of idiopathic TTP, as well as patients with preg nancy 
associated TTP and TTP secondary to an autoimmune disease (SLE) (18, 19) .  
Additionally, persistent or recurrent antibody inhibitors of ADAMTS13 have been 
associated with recurrences of TTP as well as a chronic relapsing form of the disease, 
giving more validity to the hypothesis  of targeting the antibody inhibitor of ADAMTS13 
(20-22).  In their review of 142 consecutive patients with TTP from the Oklahoma TTP -
HUS Registry, Vesely et al described an inverse relationship between ADAMT S13 
activity and both exacerbations (recurrent thrombocytopenia requiring the resumption of 
PE less than 30 days from the cessation of PE) and relapses of TTP that was most 
striking in patients with a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. (21)   Of the 18 patients with a 
severe deficiency of the protease, all but one had a demonstrable antibody inhibitor.  
Therefore, although patients are able to achieve a clinical remission with PE, a 
persistent antibody inhibitor of ADAMTS13 likely is a factor contributing to higher rates 
of exacerbation and relapse in patients with idiopathic TTP.  Similar data was reported 
by [CONTACT_572873], showing that 3 of 4 patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and high 
titer inhibitory antibodies had a chronic relapsing course of their disease. (23)  In these 4 
patients PE did not result in any detectable plasma ADAMTS13 activity or a consistent 
reduction in the inhibitor titer.  It is important to note that the risk of relapse in patient s 
with persistent inhibitors is not uniform, as not all patients with persistent inhibitors are 
destined to relapse. (24)  Recent data has also suggested that a severe deficiency of 
ADAMTS13 protease function alone may not always be sufficient to trigger an acute 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_572864]. (25)   
 
2.[ADDRESS_752029] to PE therapy as well as a prophylactic therapy 
preventing the recurrence of disease.  In theory , PE would serve a s a “supportive 
therapy”, physically removing the inhibitor and inducing remission, while at the same 
time allowing CSA, a “disease -modifying therapy”, time to exert its effect.  An effective  
immunosuppressive therapy could inhibit the production of the a ntibody inhibitor of 
ADAMTS13, resulting in shorter courses of PE, decreased exacerbations and relapse 
rates, and decreased exposure to the potential risks associated with plasma based 
therapy.  Many cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents have been reporte d to be 
effective in relapsed and refractory TTP, including: corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, cyclosporine, and rituximab. (22, 23, 26 -38)  Unfortunately, there has been 
very little good, prospective d ata with which to accurately judge the effectiveness of a 
particular therapy without confounding factors.  Rituximab has been reported to be 
effective in refractory TTP, as well as being effective as prophylactic therapy in patients 
with recurrent inhibito rs and a chronic relapsing course of TTP. (22)  Rituximab though 
may have significant drawbacks including the need for intravenous administration, the 
potential for infusional toxicity and infectious complications.  The issue of the active 
removal of rituximab when combined with PE therapy also remains to be addressed.  
Advantages with both corticosteroids and cyclosporine include their ability to be 
 - 5 - administered orally, and in the case of cyclosporine, the ability to  be administered 
concurrently with PE without significantly affecting cyclosporine concentration. (39)   
 
 
 
2.5 Corticosteroids  
Corticosteroids are routinely been used and recommended (40) as an adjunct to PE, but 
until recently no prospective studies have addressed their efficacy as an adjunct to PE.  
Among the series of patients reported by [CONTACT_572873], four patients with undetectable 
ADAMTS13 activity and high titer inhibitors o f the protease were followed serially. Two 
were treated with corticosteroids as an adjunct to plasma exchange. Both showed no 
sustained improvement in ADAMTS13 activity or inhibitor titers during the follow -up 
period.  Data from our prospective cohort stud y of corticosteroids as an adjunct to PE 
also showed that the addition of corticosteroids to PE did not reduce the exacerbation 
rate compared to historical data from the Oklahoma TTP registry where corticosteroids 
are not routinely used. (6, 21, 41)  
 
2.6  Clinical Outcome - Concurrent Corticosteroids and PE as Initial Therapy  
 A total of 12 patients with idiopathic TTP were treated with corticosteroids and PE.  
Patients received prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day conc urrently with daily plasma 
exchange therapy which was continued until remission was achieved (platelet count 
>150 x 109/ul).  PE was then tapered and discontinued with the prednisone tapered over 
the next 4 weeks.  Ten of 12 patients achieved remission aft er a median of 6.5 daily 
exchanges, but exacerbations of TTP  occurred in 6/10 (60%), comparable to the 50% 
exacerbation rate from the Oklahoma Blood Institute where steroids were not routinely 
used. (Table 1)  More importantly, there was no significant im provement in ADAMTS13 
activity at remission nor suppression of the inhibitor measured within a week of tapering 
PE.  Given these data, we then began to study alternative forms of immunosuppressive 
therapy as an adjunct to PE.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.0 Rationale for Concurrent Cyclosporine and Plasma Exchange in TTP  
Cyclosporine has been reported to be effective in cases of rela psed or refractory 
TTP. (26, 30, 31, 33)   Our group has published a series of 3 patients with early        Clinical Data

 - 6 - recurrences of TTP treated with cyclosporine alone, without the need for plasma 
exchange or infusion. (42)  In addition to the clinical improvement seen, all [ADDRESS_752030] 
of CSA is thought to be related to its ability to inhibit the activation of genes necessary 
for the B -cell “helper” function (IL -4 and CD 40 ligand) of T -cells and T -cell proliferation 
(IL-2) required f or the sustained production of high -affinity antibodies and memory B -
cells to perpetuate a significant and sustained antibody response. (43)  There is also 
increasing evidence that CD4+/CD25+ T-regulatory cells may be important in the control 
of pathologic immune responses in autoimmune hematologic disorders such as 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune  thrombocytopenic purpura (44-47).  Low 
dose therapy with cyclosporine has also been shown to promote the development of 
CD24+/CD25- T-regulatory cells in an animal model, providing an additional rationale for 
the u se of CSA concurrent with PE.    
 
3.1 Concurrent Cyclosporine and PE for Exacerbations and Refractory TTP   
Ten patients with exacerbations or refractory TTP  after their initial therapy  received CSA  
concurrent with the resumption of PE. (48)  All 10 patients were treated with concurrent 
CSA (2 -3 mg/kg in a twice daily divided dose) and PE.  CSA was continued for a tot al of 
6 months and then discontinued.  Nine of the 10 patients achieved remission after a 
median of 11 daily exchanges (range, 5 -45), with only 1/9(9%) suffering an 
exacerbation after tapering PE.  Median follow -up for the entire cohort is 31 months 
(range , 12 to 41).  Eight of the 10 patients maintained a continuous remission 
throughout the planned 6 months of CSA and then discontinued therapy.   
 
3.2 Concurrent Cyclosporine and PE as Upfront Therapy  
Building on the findings of our initial  study that suggeste d a clinical benefit for the 
addition of CSA to PE, we initiated a study of concurrent CSA and PE as the upfront 
therapy of idiopathic TTP.  Eleven of 12 patients achieved remission after a median of 5 
daily exchanges.  Median follow -up for the entire coho rt was 1 6 months (range, 1 to 25).  
None of the [ADDRESS_752031] suffered an exacerbation, a 
statistically significant difference compared to the corticosteroid treated patients (0% v. 
60%, p=<0.05).{Cataland, 2006 #375} Seven  of the 10 patients maintained a continuous 
remission throughout the planned 6 month course of CSA , with one recently enrolled 
patient having only completed 5 months of CSA to date .  Two patients suffered a 
recurrence of TTP while still taking CSA after 3 and 4 months of CSA therapy 
respectively, with one of the patients relapsing 2 weeks after a 50% dose reduction of 
CSA as mandated by [CONTACT_572874] 1.5 mg/dl 
(range, 0.9 -1.4 mg/dl).  Further analysis of this patient r evealed his CSA concentration 
to be sub -therapeutic, arguing that his mild renal insufficiency was not related to CSA 
toxicity, but rather may have been related to his underlying thrombotic microangiopathy.  
These data from both cohort studies suggest that  the use of CSA as an adjunct to PE 
resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the exacerbation rate 
 - 7 - compared to concurrent corticosteroids and PE, preventing the need for re -exposure to 
the potential risks associated with PE thera py.   
 
3.3 Combined Analysis: ADAMTS13 Activity , Antigen and Inhibitor  After      
Concurrent CSA and PE  
Patients on both cohort studies (exacerbation/refractory study and upfront study) of 
CSA and PE were followed serially to study the effect of CSA on ADAMTS1 [ADDRESS_752032] of PE 
that resulted in the steady improvement in ADAMTS13 activity seen in this cohort of 
patients.

4.0 Toxicity of Combined Analysis of CSA and PE  
Overall therap y with concurrent CSA and PE was well tolerated.  Two patients treated 
with concurrent cyclosporine and PE had increases of the serum creatinine to 1.5 mg/dl 
 - 8 - (normal < 1.4 mg/dl) after two and 4 weeks of cyclosporine therapy; both patients had 
their dose o f cyclosporine decreased by 50% with subsequent normalization of the 
serum creatinine.  Although this was presumed to be related to the cyclosporine, the 
concentrations of the drug obtained at the same time were not above the therapeutic 
range, raising the  possibility that this mild increase in the serum creatinine may be 
related to the renal effects of TTP.  Mild gastrointestinal toxicity was transiently 
experienced by 2 patients as well but did not require a decrease in the dose or 
frequency of the CSA th erapy

5.4.[ADDRESS_752035] mental status changes related to 
their diagnosis of TTP (typi[INVESTIGATOR_572865]) that may prevent 
them from being able to provide informed  consent.  If the principal 
investigator, co -investigator, or research study nurse  do not feel the 
patient is able to provide informed consent, the study consent may be 
signed by [CONTACT_102]’s legally authorized representative to enroll the 
patient in the study.  
 
 If the patient’s legally authorized representative signs the consent, the 
patient must be then re -consented with the “re -consent form” if/when the 
patient regains the ability to provide informed consent.   
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_752036] igators is detailed in section 15.0 of the 
protocol.   
 
6.0 Randomization of Patients  
  
 6.1 Patients will be randomized at the time of registration/enrollment on this 
clinical trial  via contact [CONTACT_572875]/coordinator at the time of the 
initial re gistration of the subject.  The study statistician ([CONTACT_572892])  
will conduct the randomization and relay this information to the study 
nurse who will be in contact [CONTACT_572876]/enrolling physician so that 
the appropriate medication (prednisone or  cyclosporine) may be 
immediately started with PE .     
   
7.0  Treatment Plan: Initial Therapy  
 
7.1 Therapeutic Plasma Exchange -Both Study Arms  
 
7.1.1 Plasma exchange will be started as soon as the diagnosis of TTP has 
been made. (section 5. 2.1).  As it is  important to institute therapy as soon 
as possible, patients will not have therapy delayed while obtaining 
informed consent.   
 
7.1.2  Plasma exchange will be per formed daily with one plasma volume 
exchanged using  plasma as the replacement fluid  until a complete  
remission is obtained (see response criteria 8.0).  
  
7.1.[ADDRESS_752037] 
to PE depending on the outcome of randomization  (see sections 7.2 -7.3 
below) .  Therapy with these adjuncts will be initiated  concurrent with and 
continue throughout plasma exchange therapy  as described below .   
 
7.1.4  After a complete remission (see response criteria 8.0) has been attained 
patients will have one exchange performed every other day for a total of [ADDRESS_752038] of the two exchanges.  
 
7.2 Corticosteroid Study Arm  
 
7.2.1 At the time of diagnosis, patients will be started on daily prednisone 
therapy at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (rounde d off to the nearest 20 mg 
multiple) concurrently with daily PE.  Patients unable to take oral 
corticosteroids will be switched to an equivalent intravenous corticosteroid 
until they are able to take oral medications.  Patients may receive 
intravenous cort icosteroids at any time to urgently treat reactions to the 
 - [ADDRESS_752039] PE 
procedure. Subsequently, p atien ts should decrease the dose by 50% each 
week over 4 consecutive weeks, starting on day 31. All corticosteroids 
should be discontinued completely by [CONTACT_2671] 4 week taper  
(approximately 8 weeks total of corticosteroid therapy) . 
 
7.3 Cyclosporine  (Neor al) Study Arm  
 
 7.3.[ADDRESS_752040] stay on that same 
brand of cyclosporine throughout the 6 month course as the differing 
brands cannot be used interchangeably.   
 
7.3.2 At the time of diagnosis, patients will be started on daily cyclosporine  
(Neoral)  therap y at a dose of 2 -3 mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest 50 
mg increment) concurrent with daily plasma exchange.  Doses will be 
administered in the capsule form.  The total dose will be divided into twice 
daily dosing.  For consistency and standardization of cy closporine levels 
throughout the study, doses of Neoral (cyclosporine) should be given at 8 
AM and 8 PM each day.   Neoral (cyclosporine) should be taken on an 
empty stomach, and patients should not eat for at least 30 minutes after 
their dose of Neoral (cy closporine).   Cyclosporine will be continued for a 
total of six months of therapy and then discontinued .   
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_752041] the dose of CSA 
modified to minimize any potential added nephrotoxicity of CSA.  Patient s 
with a serum creatinine of 2.5 mg/dl or greater will not begin therapy with 
CSA until the serum creatinine has fallen below this threshold.  Patients 
with a serum creatinine of 1. 5-2.5 mg/dl will have the CSA dose 
decreased by 50% until the serum creatin ine has normalized (< 1. 5 mg/dl).  
After renal function as measured by [CONTACT_572877] 2 -3 
mg/kg/day.  
 
7.4 Management of Cyclosporine Dosing and Concentrations  
 
7.4.1  The optimal therapeutic concentration of CSA in TTP is not known.  For 
the purpose of this study, the target CSA concentration will be identical to 
the accepted therapeutic CSA concentration  at each institution (100-400 
ng/ml  at Ohio State University ) when used as immu nosuppressive 
therapy.  As described below, dose adjustments of CSA will not be made 
to reach this goal, but rather the dosing will only be changed for patients 
with supratherapeutic concentrations or a decline in renal function.   Only 
 - [ADDRESS_752042] already taken their CSA on the morning of the CSA concentration 
measurements, dose adjustments should only be made in clinical toxicity 
is present (hypertension. anxiety, diarrhea, emesis).   
 
7.4.2  Cyclosporine levels (trough) will be monitored after the third day of 
therapy, weekly for the first 4 weeks of therapy and then monthly while 
they are taking CSA to monitor drug levels and minimize any potential 
nephrotoxic effects (see section 9.2, Laboratory  Studies During Plasma 
Exchange) Patients should not take their CSA prior to having the CSA 
levels drawn, but should take their scheduled dose after their blood is 
drawn that day in order to check trough CSA levels.  Trough levels of CSA 
should be obtained  at [ADDRESS_752043] the dose altered as described below  and levels checked again in 
3 day s (see Appendix 2).  Subjects with trough cyclosporine concentration 
of 401 -500 ng/ml should decrease the dose of cyclosporine by 25% and 
recheck the trough concentration in 3 days.  Subjects with cyclosporine 
concentrations of 501 -600 ng/ml should decreas e the dose by 50% and 
recheck the concentration in 3 days.  Subjects with cyclosporine 
concentrations greater than 600 ng/ml should hold any further 
cyclosporine doses until the levels are rechecked in 3 days.  If the 
cyclo sporine concentration is  now less  than 600 ng/ml, a 50% dose 
reduction should be performed with future dose adjustments made 
depending on future cyclosporine concentration determinations as 
described above.  Although there is a theoretical concern regarding the 
effect of daily plasma exch ange on CSA levels, it has been reported that 
plasma exchange had no significant effect on measured CSA levels. (39)  
 
7.5 Dose Adjustments During Cyclosporine Therapy and Renal Insufficiency  
 
          7.5.1 Patients who subsequently develop renal insufficiency  during the 6 month 
course of CSA  (serum creatinine >1.5, but < 2.5 mg/dl) will have the dose 
decreased by 50% (see Appendix 2).  The dose will be returned to the  
same planned dose (2 -3 mg/kg) after the serum  creatinine has returned to 
normal (<1. 5 mg/dl).   If patient s do not tolerate the resumption of CSA to 
the full dose (recurrent increase in the serum creatinine, high CSA levels), 
patients should be maintained on the dose level that was able to achieve a 
therapeutic CSA levels without renal toxicity.   Patients with a serum 
creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl will have the CSA held, and restarted 
only when the serum creatinine is < 2.5 mg/dl, with the change in dos ing 
schedule the same as described above.  
 - [ADDRESS_752044] 
been met  within 4 weeks from enrollment and maintained after the tapering o f 
plasma exchange:  
 
- platelet count >150,000  
- normalization of LDH  
- a decreased or unchanged serum creatinine compared to the creatinine 
measurement obtained at the time of enrollment.  
- clinical improvement in neurologic findings/deficits without the 
developm ent of new neurologic findings/deficits by [CONTACT_572878].  
 
8.2 Partial Response  
 
 8.2.1 Patients showing improvement (increase in platelet count and a decrease 
in the LDH, but not meeting the full criteria for complete remission) should 
continue concurrent CSA or prednisone and plasma exchange therapy for 
up to [ADDRESS_752045] been unable to achieve 
remission but will remain on this protocol for the purposes of data and

8.4.1 Criteria to determine recurrences of disease and the need for re -initiation 
of therap y with plasma exchange will be the same as those to diagnose 
TTP (section 5.2.1) .  Patients requiring the reinstitution of plasma -based 
therapy (plasma exchange or infusion) within the first [ADDRESS_752047] an “exa cerbation” of their 
TTP.

“relapse” for the purposes of this study.  
 
8.5 Treatment after Recurrences of TTP  
 
8.5.1  Patients suffering exacerbations of TTP as described in the protocol 
(Section 6.4) after treatment on the corticosteroid arm of this study may 
then be treated with CSA concurrent with the resumption of plasma 
exchange at the same dose and schedule a s described in the CSA arm of 
this randomized trial, assuming that they still meet enrollment criteria 
(including the serum creatinine).  Patients will also discontinue the 
corticosteroids on the same day that CSA is initiated.  Patients treated 
with CSA a nd PE for exacerbations of TTP will then be prospectively 
followed as described below (Section 9.3 – 9.5), but will be analyzed 
independently  from the patients treated with CSA and PE as the upfront 
therapy.  
 
8.5.2  Patients suffering a relapse (recurrence greate r than [ADDRESS_752049] 
exchange procedure) whether during CSA or after completing 6 months of  
CSA will continue to be followed on this study for the purposes of 
gathering follow -up data, but may be treated at the discretion of the 
treating physician .

10.1 Definition of Adverse Events/Severe Adverse Events  
 
10.1.1  Adverse events as defined in the Internation al Council on Harmonisation 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice are described as: “an untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this t reatment” (ICH E6:1.2).   
 
10.1.2  A serious adverse event is an adverse event that:  
 
 -is fatal  
 -is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
-results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169016]  
-results in persisten t or significant disability/incapacity  
 - 17 - -is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
-other significant hazard  
 
10.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
  
10.2.1  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_572867]/coordinator 
coordinating site (Ohio State University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  Contact [CONTACT_572879] 16.[ADDRESS_752057] be 
reported verbally and faxed to the coordinating site within 7 days of the 
occurrence using the supplied “Adverse Event” form (see Appendix 3).  All 
serious adverse events must be communicated to the coordinating site 
verbally within the first 24 hours of the occurrence of the event.  The 
“Adverse Event” form (see Appendix 3) mus t also be completed and 
returned to the coordinating site within [ADDRESS_752058]. Haifeng Wu for processing and analysis.  Samples will be 
 - 18 - labeled with a unique identification number so that the biological data 
obtained may be correlated with the patient’s clinical course by [CONTACT_4520].   This will help ensure patient confidentiality, as the 
investigators will be the only people to know the patient name [CONTACT_572891].  Samples to 
be used for future study will be frozen at -80C an d also be stored in the 
laboratory of [CONTACT_192437].  Laboratory studies unique to this protocol, including: 
ADAMTS13 activity, antigen level, and inhibitor assays will be performed 
in [CONTACT_192437]’s laboratory.     
 
11.[ADDRESS_752059] number.  By 
[CONTACT_572880], patient samples may be tied to clinical information by 
[CONTACT_572881].  Only the 
principal investigator, co -investigator, and the study nurse/coordinator will 
have access to both the study number and the corresponding patient 
identification information.  Clinical information or laboratory data used for 
publication will not iden tify patients in any way that could potentially 
breach patient confidentiality.   
 
13.[ADDRESS_752060]. Wu’s laboratory has invested tremendous efforts to validate and 
standardize t he tests for ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitory titer to meet 
the requirements set forth by [CONTACT_9891] (CAP) 
for clinical testing. Both tests are done using a SELDI -TOF mass 
spectrometer. Validation studies were performed to evaluat e test 
accuracy, test precision, reportable range, and te st linearity.  For example, 
 - [ADDRESS_752061] accuracy was partly evaluated by [CONTACT_6310] a set of unknowns and 
correlating the results with those from the Coagulation Reference 
Laboratory at the BloodCenter of Wisc onsin (kindly supported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ken 
Friedman).  Excellent correlation was achieved between SELDI -TOF and 
the FRET assays for ADAMTS13 (activity and inhibitor titer). ADAMTS13 
activity and inhibitor titer assayts are now offered as clinical tests at 
OSUMC an d are performed under SOPs with QC reagents (normal and 
abnormal) included in each run to ensure test accuracy. Longitudinal 
evaluation of QC samples is performed to monitor the test reproducibility 
and analytical performance of the instrument.  
In late 2005, [CONTACT_192437]’s laboratory  started using the SELDI -TOF mass 
spectrometry -based method to determine ADAMTS13 activity in patient 
samples (49).  This new test offers a rapid result within [ADDRESS_752062] reproducibility  (6, 42, 49, 50) . In 2008, [CONTACT_192437] laboratory 
modified the  SELDI -TOF assay to now detect as low as 0.5% of  
ADAMTS13 activity in clinical samples (51). With this improvement we 
now can more precisely measure ADAMTS13 activity in most samples 
with extremely low a ctivity.  This in turn provides a dataset with 
quantifiable values in >95% of TTP samples to help for statistical analysis.    
 
 13.2  Laboratory Method for ADAMTS13 Antigen and Antibody  (IgG) 
Concentrations  
 
Quantification of ADAMTS13 antigen and ADAMTS13  autoantibody (IgG) 
will be measured using commercially available ELISA kits from American 
Diagnostica Inc. (IMUBIND® ADAMTS13 ELISA and ADAMTS13 
Autoantibody ELISA). These two kits have been validated in our laboratory 
and used for several studies  (6, 42, 49, 50) .  The reference ranges for 
both kits were determined using healthy donors (n=41) recruited from the 
local population. The results for the autoantibody ELISA are reported as 
micrograms of IgG antibody and fo r ADAMTS13 antigen reported as 
nanograms of ADAMTS13 protein per milliliter of patient plasma 
respectively.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_752063] for the determination of inhibitory titer as Bethesda units (BU). BU in 
each sample is defined as the dilution of patient plasma that neutralizes 
50% of ADAMTS13 activity in an equal volume of pooled normal plasma 
(PNP).  This method is similar to the sta ndard laboratory procedure for the 
determination of BU for clotting factors that requires 1 hour incubation 
after mixing pati ent plasma (or dilute) with PNP (52).13.4 Laboratory 
Method for VWF multimeric analysis : 
VWF multimeric analysis will be performed in Biomarker Reference 
Laboratory at the Ohio State University Medical Center. [CONTACT_192437] is the

research fund under this clinical trial study.  
 
 
 
14.0 Statistical Ana lysis  
 
14.1  Statistical Considerations -Sample Size Determination   
  
  
 For the study of the primary endpoint ( treatment success rate), the sample 
size required is calculated based on the data from our previous publications. 
In these previous studies that looked separately at CSA/PE in 10 patients and 
at corticoste roids/PE in another 10 patients , we saw promising results that led 
to our hypothesis that CSA/PE treatment for TTP patients results in greater 
treatment response. In those studies, the primary end point was the proportion 
of patients who had TTP exacerbation, which is a more stringent endpoint that 
does not include other types of treatment failures such as refractory patients 
and/or death within [ADDRESS_752065] -PE. In the previous published pi[INVESTIGATOR_101122], 
we showed that 6/10 corticosteroid -treated patients exacerbated v ersus 0/10 
CSA-treated patients. Combined with experience with subsequently treated 
patients, we observed an overall treatment success rate of 80% and 83% in 
refractory  vs. de novo TTP pa tients, respectively, treated with CSA+PE 
versus 33% in those treated with corticosteroids+PE.  
   In terms of our primary endpoint of treatment success rate, we have 
designed a phase III trial that compares the proportion of treatment successes 
in each ar m. Specifically, this study design will have at least 80% power to 
determine a significant difference in the treatment success rates between the 
arms if the true rates are 50% vs. 80%, assuming a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_752066]. We plan to enroll a total of 72 patients to this trial (36 to 
each arm) to test the null hypothesis that there is no  difference in treatment 
success rate between these treatments.  
  
 
14.[ADDRESS_752067] PE procedure unless a 
treatment failure has been documented prior to that timepoint. The treatment 
success rates wi ll be calculated for each of the treatment arms along with 
their 95% confidence intervals. These proportions will be compared between 
treatment arms using Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test to accommodate the 
 - 21 - stratification factor (recurrent vs. de novo TTP e vent). Statistical significance 
will be concluded based on a significance level of 0.05.  
   This study includes an interim analysis and formal “look” at the data 
after [ADDRESS_752068] been accrued (12 to each arm), where the null 
hypothesis will be rejec ted if the calculated p -value comparing the two 
observed success rates for the treatment arms is <0.0002 (based on the Lan -
DeMets alpha spending function and O’Brien -Fleming boundary calculation). 
We will also evaluate safety and tolerability data for each  of the arms at the 
interim analysis, and these data will be reviewed not only by [CONTACT_572882].  
   Through this study we also planned an internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_572868] [ADDRESS_752069] been accrued (6 to each arm) in an effor t to 
obtain information on the feasibility of accrual and treatment follow -up for the 
endpoints; as an internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], all patients will be included in the overall 
trial and thus included in the interim and final analyses unless serious 
logistical is sues were identified that would introduce bias by [CONTACT_572883]. 
We reached the accrual point for this internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_572869]; therefore, all patients will be included in the 
overall study. With so few patients , this internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_572870]; the early data were not formally evaluated and did 
not require a re -evaluation of our assumptions for the study design described 
above.     
   Additionally, we will evaluate several secondary cl inical endpoints 
through this trial, including: 1) exacerbation rate within [ADDRESS_752070] -PE; 2) 
clinical  response rate; 3) the number of PE procedures required to achieve a 
clinical response; 4) relapse rate; and 5) safety and tolerability of each of the 
adjuvant treatments to PE.  Each of the rates will be calculated assuming 
that these endpoints are binomially distributed, and 95% confidence intervals 
generated. For the exacerbation rate endpoint, we will only include those 
patients who have achieved clin ical response (i.e. excluding refractory 
patients) and compare these rates between the two arms. We will have at 
least 80% power to detect a difference if the true exacerbation rates are 55% 
vs. 90% for this subset analysis (not adjusting for multiple comp arisons); 
however, this comparison is distinctly ancillary to our primary clinical interest 
of achieving treatment success in all patients treated versus only keepi[INVESTIGATOR_572871]. We will also 
evaluate relapse as a time -to-event variable, where Kaplan -Meier methods 
will be used to assess time to relapse from last plasma exchange in 
responding patients. The number of exchange procedures required to 
achieve clinical response will be assessed between arms using Poisso n 
regression. Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by [CONTACT_572884]. In 
addition to these planned quantitative analyses, we will also use graphical 
 - [ADDRESS_752071] TTP exacerbation and 
relapse are likely to be different.  
   To examine the potential of the 4 indices (ADAMTS13 a ctivities, 
ADAMTS13 antigen levels, ADAMTS13 (IgG) autoantibody levels, and 
antibody inhibitor titers) to predict the recurrences of TTP, we will use the 
longitudinal data in two ways by [CONTACT_572885] w hen they are measured every three months 
(quarterly) from those indices measured during the initial clinical response 
when patients are monitored weekly.  The data for the relapse analysis will 
come from all quarterly samples collected from qualified study  subjects during 
sustained remission.  The outcome of interest will be whether or not the 
 - 23 - individual experiences a relapse of TTP during the three months following the 
date the measurements are taken. We anticipate obtaining a total of >400 
observations th at will correspond to approximately >16 events of relapse and 
other quarterly measurements (n ~ 400) without relapses. For analysis of 
exacerbation in initial clinical remission, the outcome of interest will be 
whether or not the individual experiences an event of exacerbation in the 
week following the measurement.  The weekly samples in initial clinical 
remission from the same group of study subjects will be analyzed. We 
anticipate a total of about 200 weekly data points, corresponding to about >16 
measure ments with events of exacerbation and 200 measurements without 
events in the week following measurement. We will use the logistic regression 
model to analyze all 4 indices independently as well as to evaluate their 
interacting effects.  
   Since each indiv idual has several observations, possibly with and 
without relapse or exacerbation, this would induce a special correlation 
structure. For this reason, we will introduce random effects into the model (53-
55). The cov ariates corresponding to gender, age, race, and treatment 
modalities (e.g. CSA vs. corticosteroids) will also be evaluated in the model.  
Additionally, various variance -covariance structures will be investigated. The 
Generalized Estimation Equation will al so be used if necessary if our specific 
covariance structures l ead to un -interpretable results .  Since the number of 
predictor variables is relatively small, a standard traditional model selection 
procedure will likely be feasible to study the reach of the  predictors as well as 
their interacting effects. Various model selection criteria such as Ra2, Mallows 
Cp, AIC, and BIC will be used to evaluate the putative models. In the case 
where samples are not available on all subjects at consistent timepoints, we 
will utilize the more flexible growth curve modeling approach to identify 
changes over time in the biomarker on the incidence and time to relapse as 
well as TTP exacerbation.  
  VWF multimer patterns form a relatively complex dataset. We will 
dissect VWF p atterns into several parameters that will all give rise to a 
continuous measurement. This will be the density of VWF multimers in 
bands 1 through 15 and the area above band 15. All data will be 
normalized by [CONTACT_572886]. For i nvestigating 
the relationship between ULVWF (area above band 15) and relapse in the 
quarter immediately following, a logistic regression analysis as described 
will be performed. Specifically, the response variable will be [ADDRESS_752072] therapy 
for TTP (plasma exchange therapy), either the patie nt or their insurance 
carrier will be responsible for all of the medical expenses associated with 
the treatment of their TTP.  The costs associated with the experimental 
laboratory studies will be paid by [CONTACT_572887].  Patients enrolled on this 
study will not incur any additional expenses as a result of enrolling on this 
protocol.

node, pancreas, and/or kidney.  
This study will consist of a Baseline period (Day -28 to Day -1), Enrollment, Treat ment 
period (Day 1 up to Day 3), and After treatment visits occurring 6 weeks  (optional) , [ADDRESS_732868] -G Survey will be administered at baseline and every visit after completion of 
Study Therapy.  
Safety assessment performed will include collection of Adverse Events (AEs), vital 
signs, and physical  exam, ECOG and laboratory assessments.  
CT scan of the Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis will be conducted at baseline, 6 weeks / 
optional  (± 1 week) after study therapy and every 3 months (± 1 week) until 12 months 
(± 1 week) after completion of SABR.  
All AEs will be collected upon initiation of treatment and for a minimum of 100 days 
after completion of study treatment or until resolution,  whichever occurs later. Any 
pregnancy that occur  at the time of study participation are to be reported.

2. Subject has central or ultra-central  lung tumor that would receive SABR on 
this study, defined as a lesion located within [ADDRESS_732873] has a ny unresolved toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 5.0 > grade 2) from previous anti -cancer therapy  
6. Any condition, therapy or lab ab normality in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_558198], evaluation of study treatment or interpretation 
of study results   
7. Subject has received p rior radiation therapy that directly overlaps any 
radiation therapy given in this study  
8. Subject has received  radiation therapy that could lead to an unacceptably high 
risk of clinically significant normal tissue injury due to high cumulative normal 
tissue dose as determined by [CONTACT_093]  
9. Female subject  who are pregnant or breastfeeding  
10. Subject who has received vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor 
such as bevacizumab within 4 weeks prior to study therapy or planned to receive 
it within 4 weeks after study therapy.  
Radiation Therapy  
1. Simulation: Both MRI and CT simulations scans must be performed in the 
treatment position.  MRI simulation scans should be performed on the MRIdian 
Linac. Use of dummy MRI coils is permitted.  
2. Supplemental Oxygen:  At the treating physician’s discretion, the patient may 
be simulated and treated with supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_558210].  The oxygen flow rate will be at t he treating physician’s discretion 
although is suggested to be approximately 2 -3 L/min.    
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- 002     Version 7.0, dated 30  AUG 2022  
 
 
Page 8 of 43 
Confidential  3. Daily MR image  guidance: The use of image  guidance using MRI is mandatory.  
This will include a pre -treatment volumetric MRI using a TRUFI sequence that 
will be obtained prior to each delivered fraction.  
 
4. Target Volumes:  
• Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)  will ,include visible tumor as seen on 
MRI/CT  
• Clinical Target Volume (CTV) is optional and will be used at the 
discretion of the treating physician  
• Planning Target Volume (PTV)  will be created from a 3- 5 mm  uniform  
expansion from the GTV/CTV  
 
5. Prescription dose and fractionation  
Each lesion will be treated in one fraction. The prescription dose is dependent 
on the anatomic location of the lesion and based on previously published 
safety data.  
6. Treatment Planning Step-and-shoot intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT) using 6 MV FFF photons will be used. Ideally, ≥95% of the PTV and 
≥99% of the GTV/CTV should receive ≥ 100% of the prescribed dose. Hotspots 
of at least 120- 130% of the prescription dose are permitted, and in fact are 
encouraged, if they are located within the GTV and not in organs at risk 
(OARs).  For patients treated to multiple lesions, separate plans will be 
generated for each lesion if treated  sequential ly while one plan will be 
generated if all lesions are treated in the same session. The cumulative dose 
to OARs from all treat ment plans should be assessed regardless of the number 
of lesions.  
 
7. Treatment delivery and on -table adaptive replanning  All patients will 
receive radiation therapy using photons on the MRIdian Linac system . For 
each delivered fraction, a volumetric MRI data set will be obtained using 
system integrated sequences . An estimated delivered dose will be calculated 
and saved using the software on the console (dose prediction). An adapted 
radiation therapy plan is created based on physician assessment of medical 
necessity. If required, adaptive replanning must be performed on the day of 
treatment delivery in order to achieve at least the same dose avoidance as the 
original plans. If multiple lesions are to be treated on this study, it is preferred 
that each one should be treated separately  although it is permitted that multiple 
be treated concurrently .. During radiation dose delivery, continuous cine MR 
image acquisition in at least one principal plane is mandatory for soft tissue 
tracking and radiation beam gating.  
Treatment Response Evaluation  
 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- 002     Version 7.0, dated 30  AUG 2022  
 
 
Page 9 of 43 
Confidential  Imaging Assessment Treatment response will be evaluated using the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline, version 1.1.  
Statistical Methods   
 
Primary objective:  
The point estimate for feasibility will be reported as a binary varia ble with its 
95% confidence interval.  The point estimate for tolerability will be reported as 
a binary variable with its 95% confidence interval.  
  
Secondary objectives:  
1-year local control (LC) will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and 
will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method along with the corresponding 
95% confidence interval from the time of study treatment.  
 
1-year overall survival (OS) will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method 
along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval from the time of study 
treatment.  
 
The proportion of patients who experience acute grade 3 or higher toxicity 
attributable to SABR will be determined along with the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval.  For patients receiving SABR to multiple l esions, acute 
toxicity will be determined from the date of the initiation of SABR.   
 
Patient -reported quality of life will be determined using the FACT -G survey 
instrument prior to and after SABR.

Confidential  1. BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 Stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR)  
Radiation therapy (RT) has historically been delivered using a fractionated approach, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_558199], based on  classic radiobiological principles to 
optimize tumor cell kill and allow for normal tissue repair (1).  This approach has served 
as the foundation for the field of r adiation oncology and can achieve effective palliation 
or cure when typi[INVESTIGATOR_285554] a multi -disciplinary manner with systemic therapy and/or 
surgery.   
 
Technological advances over the most recent decades have achieved increasingly 
conformal delivery of radiation dose such that there is better sparing of normal tissues, 
which in some cases may allow for an increase in dose delivered to the target (2-4).  
These advances include improvements in complex modulation of delivered dose, 
motion management for mobile tumors, and on- board imaging guidance capabilities (5, 
6).  A benefit of these improvements is the ability to  delive r hypofractionated radiation 
therapy, or doses larger than approximately 2 Gy per fraction, in a fewer number of 
fractions.  Extreme hypofractionation can be delivered using stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT)  in 5 or fewer fractions (7).  A unique radiological effect of delivering 
larger dose per fraction, such as >8 Gy, has been proposed(8).  
 
Important to note is that the term stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) is not 
synonymous with ablative radiation dose as non- ablative dose can be delivered with this 
technique; ablative dose is generally agreed to be a biologically effective dose (BED10) 
of at least 100 Gy .  For example, SBRT for pancreas cancer is typi[INVESTIGATOR_558200] a 
non-ablative dose ( i.e., 30-35 Gy in 3- 5 fractions)  due to the proximity of organs at risk 
including the small intestine, whereas SBRT for peripheral non- small cell lung cancer  is 
commonly delivered a  with ablative dose (i.e. 60 Gy in 5 fractions; BED10 = 132 Gy) .  
Outcomes of ablative SBRT are generally superior to those of non- ablative SBRT as 
there are well -described dose response relationships that have been established for 
many cancers.  The term s tereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SABR)  was 
developed to more clearly communicate that an ablative dose is prescribed(9).   
 
1.[ADDRESS_732877] used 3- 5 fractions.  Nonetheless, there are 
published prospective and retrospective studies for single- fraction SABR  as 
summarized in a recently published critical review by [CONTACT_558211] (10).  The most 
substantial supporting data for single- fraction SABR exists  for early -stage peripheral 
non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) for which several randomized trials have been 
completed s howing no significant difference in outcomes between singe-  and multi -
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- 002     Version 7.0, dated 30  AUG 2022  
 
 
Page 14 of 43 
Confidential  fraction regimens (11,12).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_558201],  the utilization of single -
fraction SABR  for early -stage NSCLC has been scarce.  Safety and feasibility of single-
fraction SABR has been demonstrated for other anatomic sites including the liver  (13), 
lymph nodes  (14), adrenal gland(15) , and the kidney (16).  Single -fraction SAB R for 
locally advanced pancreas cancer has been prospectively evaluated  (notably without 
intrafraction image guidance or daily adaptive replanning) , and has been associated 
with increased gastrointestinal toxicity compared to fractionated SABR (17).   
 
A single -fraction regimen should be at least isotoxic and isoeffective as compared to 
multi- fraction SABR for such an approach to be considered a reasonable alternative.  
Assuming that both are true, then there are several advantages of completing treatment 
in one fraction including reduced cost (18), potentially reduced lymphopenia(19) , and 
increased patient convenience.  One reason that clinicians may be hesitant to use 
single -fraction SBRT is concern about geographic miss, which stems from the lack of 
intrafraction evaluation of the tumor and internal anatomy  using a linear accelerator 
using x -ray and/or CT -guidance(20) .  Furthermore, generous margins may be placed on 
the gross tumor to decrease the risk of a geographic miss, thereby [CONTACT_558212] (21).   
 
1.3 MR-guided radiation therapy  
The recent develop of linear accelerators that use magnetic resonance (MR) instead of 
CT imaging for image guidance represents a tremendous advance in how radiation 
therapy is fundamentally delivered(22) .  MR guidance offers several important 
advantages including: 1) superior soft tissue imaging, 2) continuous intrafraction 
visualization, 3) tissue tracking and aut omatic beam triggering, and 4) the ability to 
perform on- table (or online) adaptive replanning(23) .  These technical capabilities have 
begun a transformation within the field of radiation oncology by [CONTACT_558213], especially those in immediate proximity to the target, by [CONTACT_558214], treatment in breath hold, and daily on- table adaptive 
planning to account for intrafraction changes in internal and/or tumor anatomy (6).  In 
fact, this technology is particularly well -suited for the delivery of SABR , especially in one 
fraction .   
 
There is a growing body of literature describing favorable outcomes of MR -guided 
SABR for various cancers in diverse regions of the body, including the lung(24) , 
breast (25), liver (26), pancreas (27), adrenal gland(28) , kidney (29), lymph nodes (30), 
and prostate(31) .   
 
The collective published experience of MR -guided SABR has nearly exclusively used 
multi- fraction SABR although a recent report of single- fraction MR -guided SABR for 
lung tumors to 34 Gy was recently reported from The Netherlands  suggesting feasibility 
and tolerance(32) .  However, treatment times were rather long although this can be 
explained by [CONTACT_558215]- table adaptive replanning 
prior to the start of treatment and then again half -way through; the clinical significance 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- [ADDRESS_732878] -guidance, this study was designed to explore 
the feasibility and tolerability of single- fraction SABR using an MR -LINAC  for various 
extracranial and extra- osseous tumors using on- table adaptive replanning, as needed.

5.3.  Patient  recruitment   
The patient’s treatment team, the study investigator, or treating institution’s research 
team will identify potential study participants .  The site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_558202].  However, it is expected that the patient’s treatment 
team or investigator working in consultation with the treatment team will conduct the 
initial discussion of possible study enrollment with the patient.  This recruitment process 
presents no greater than minimal risk to the privacy of screened patients.   A (partial) 
limited waiver of authorization is requested for reviewing medical records to identify 
potential research participants, conversing with patients about possible enrollment, and  
handing of personal health information.  
 
Both men and women in addition to individuals of all races and ethnic groups are 
eligible for this trial.  
 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- [ADDRESS_732883] from target lesion(s)  in the abdomen and pelvis .  There is not a requirement to 
use an immobilization device otherwise given the use of continuous infraction 
visualization with MRI . 
 
At the treating  physician’s discretion, the patient may be simulated and treated with 
supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_558216].  The oxygen flow rate will be at the 
treating phy sician’s discretion although is suggested to be approximately 2- 3 L/min.   
 
Both MRI and CT simulations scans must be performed in the treatment position.  It is 
preferred that MRI simulation be done prior to CT simulation with the CT scan 
deformably registered to the treatment planning MRI . MRI simulation scans should be 
performed on the MRIdian Linac.  Use of dummy MRI coils is permitted.  IV or oral 
contrast are not required for MRI simulation although Eovist may be used to better 
visualize hepatic lesions.  While contrast may be used for CT simulation, it is not 
required as the MRI simulation scan is expected to be the primary scan used for 
contouring and treatment planning.  Planning CT scan slice thickness should be [ADDRESS_732884] and upper 
abdomen to assess the extent of tumor motion.  
 
For patients with targets in the upper abdomen ( e.g., pancreas, adrenal gland) it is 
recommended that patients have nothing by [CONTACT_1966] (NPO) at least 2 hours prior to 
simulation or treatment.  For patients with targets in the pelvis, reproducible bladder and 
rectal filling should be attempted, as per the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
Arm position will be dependent on the location of the target lesion(s).  To improve 
patient comfort and reproducibility it is preferred that both arms be positioned down at 
the sides, as close to the body as possible, if appropriate, based on the location of the 
target lesion(s) the discretion of the treating physician .  Positioning both arms down may 
significantly limit beam angles for treating some lesions, especially those that are very 
lateral, and therefore positioning the ipsilateral arm above the head while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_558203].  Both arms may be positioned  
above the head , as needed.    
 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- [ADDRESS_732885].   
 
Patients may be treated using free breathing gating and it is strongly recommended that 
an MRI-compatible abdominal compression device be used to limit diaphragmatic 
excursion and tumor motion.   
 
6.3 Daily MR image -guidance  
The use of image- guidance using MRI is mandatory.  This will include a pre -treatment 
volumetric MRI using a TRUFI sequence  that will be obtained prior to each delivered 
fraction .  Alignment should be to soft  tissue including the target lesion.  
 
6.4 Target Volumes  
6.4.1. Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)  
 
This will include visible tumor as seen on MRI/CT.   
 
6.4.2 Clinical Target Volume (CTV)  
 
The use of a CTV is optional and at the discretion of the treating physician.   
 
It is suggested that the  CTV should be an expansion of 2-5 mm from the GTV, edited 
out of anatomic barriers to microscopic tumor spread.   
 
6.4.3 Planning Target Volume (PTV)  
 
It is preferred that a 3  mm uniform expansion from the GTV/CTV  define the PTV.  
However, a 5 mm uniform expansion will also be permitted .

6.7 Treatment planning  
Step-and-shoot i ntensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using 6 MV FFF photons 
will be  used.  Ideally, ≥95% of the PTV and ≥ 99% of the GTV/CTV should receive 
≥100% of the prescribed dose.  However, depending on the proximity of the normal 
organs, especially gastrointestinal (GI) luminal structures, that may not be achievable 
without violating normal organ constraints. If the proximity of OARs results in a clinically 
significant reduction in dose to the GTV on the original plan, defined as ≤ 80% receiving 
≥100% of the prescribed dose and/or ≤ 90% receiving ≥ 90% of the prescribed dose, 
then multi -fraction SBRT off study should be considered although will not be requir ed.  If 
patients remain on study in this scenario, then attempts should be made to optimize the 
internal anatomy on the day of treatment to improve target dose coverage as much as 
reasonably possible, for example ensuring appropriate bladder, rectal, or st omach 
filling.     
 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- [ADDRESS_732890] 120- 130% of the prescription dose are permitted , and in fact are 
encouraged,  if they are located within the GTV and not in organs at risk (OARs).   
 
Meeting all OAR constraints should be prioritized, even at the exp ense of target volume 
coverage, while secondarily optimizing target volume coverage.   
For patients treated to multiple lesions, separate plans will be generated  for each lesion.  
A planning CT dataset that includes all targets and relevant critical struct ures in the 
imaging study should be obtained when possible.  The cumulative dose to OARs from 
all treatment plans should be assessed.  If multiple lesions are treated, then OAR dose  
constraints  as described in section 6.6 should be considered to be cumulative 
constraints that should be met in total across all treatment plans regardless of the 
number of lesions treated.   
 
For targets in the abdomen and pelvis , a PRVGI should be created that is defined as 
the union of the stomach + duodenum + small bowel + large bowel contours with a 5 
mm uniform expansion.  If there is any overlap of the PRVGI with the PTV then a 
PTVopt should be created, which is the PTV minus any overlap of the PRVGI .  The 
treatment plan should be prescribed to the PTVopt instead of the PTV , ensuring that all 
OAR constraints are met.  The dose to the overlapped region of the PTV and PRVGI 
should be as high as possible while meeting all OAR constraints, although no minimum 
coverage will be required.  If there is not overlap of the PR VGI with the PTV then the 
treatment plan should be prescribed to the PTV.   
 
6.8 Treatment delivery and on -table adaptive replanning  
All patients will receive radiation therapy using photons on the MRIdian Linac system for 
alignment, dose prediction, tracking, gating, and on- table adaptive planning when 
clinically indicated.  
 
For each delivered fraction, a volumetric MRI data set will be obtained using system 
integrated sequences; the preferred sequence is a balanced gradie nt echo most similar 
to Siemens  True FISP scan with T2*/T1 weighted image- characteristics with at least a 
1.5 x 1.5 x 3.0 mm image matrix resolution. The external contour of the patient should 
be inside the field of view  where there are beam angles that will be used for treatment . 
 
The target volume will be rigidly aligned to a reference position by [CONTACT_558217]- caudal, left -right and anterior -posterior direction to optimally align 
with the planned treatment isocenter.  Depending on operator assessment, these shifts 
are then executed,  and treatment is initiated.  
 
If optimal target to isocenter alignment cannot be achieved, system integrated 
deformable image registration between the primary treatment image data  (used for 
simulation and treatment planning) and the respective fraction MRI dataset will be 
performed. Original plan contours are propagated onto the respective fraction MRI 
dataset. If on -table adaptive planning is clinically indicated, then all tumor v olumes and 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- 002     Version 7.0, dated 30  AUG 2022  
 
 
Page 24 of 43 
Confidential  critical structures within 3 cm radially and 2 cm cranial -caudal from the surface of the 
PTV will be re -contoured as needed on the volumetric high- quality MRI data set.  
 
An estimated delivered dose will be calculated and saved using the software on the 
console (dose prediction). An adapted radiation therapy plan is created based on 
physician assessment of medical necessity. General guidelines to establish medical 
necessity include but are not limited to the following:  
 
• Any OAR constraint is viol ated.  The same constraints used to develop the 
original plan will be used to on the day of treatment to determine the need to 
create an adapted plan.  
• Reduction in GTV  and/or PTV  covered by [CONTACT_558218].  
• Favorable  shift in the relation between GTV and dose- limiting OARs, such that 
adaptive planning would likely improve the coverage of the GTV . 
 
For patients treated to multiple lesions , adaptive replanning may be required in order to 
ensure that cumulative dose to O ARs meets constraints.  As the original treatment 
plans are required to cumulatively meet all OAR constraints, adaptive replanning must 
be performed on the day of treatment delivery in order to achieve at least the same 
dose avoidance as the original plans .  
 
Adaptive dose re- planning does not need to be performed if the dose prediction shows 
compliance with minimum dose coverage of the GTV and adherence to upper 
dose/volume limits of all OARs.  
 
If multiple lesions are to be treated on this study, it is rec ommended that each one 
should be treated separately as treatment of multiple lesions may significantly prolong 
total treatment time, which may be poorly tolerated by [CONTACT_102].  However, treatment 
of multiple lesions on this trial during the same session is permitted if the treating 
physician believes that treatment would be completed within a feasible amount of time.   
 
During radiation dose delivery, continuous cine MR image acquisition in at least one 
principal plane (suggested sagittal, but at the discretion of the treating physician) is 
mandatory for soft tissue tracking and radiation beam gating. To this end, a track ing 
slice of 7 -10 mm thickness will be positioned to include a cross -sectional cut of the 
target for intra- fractional soft tissue tracking. The tracking/gating volume will be 
preferably delineated based on the GTV, or otherwise on a well visualized surrogate in 
proximity to the GTV.  
 
The software should be set so that if 5% or more of the tracked target extends outside 
of the boundary the beam will gate off.  For soft tissue tracking and gating, a minimum 
cine frame rate of 4 frames/second is mandatory thr oughout dose delivery although 
higher frame rates ( e.g., 8 frames/second) may be used if available.

• Target volume/OAR contouring ended  
• Predicted dose calculation completed  
• Treatment plan re- optimization finalized (if performed)  
• Treatment delivery started  
• Treatment delivery completed  
 
6.9 Treatment plan storage  
All clinically approved plans, structures delineated for dose prediction, predicted doses, 
as well as all adapted radiation therapy plans will be saved and stored in the MRIdian 
associated software. All initial plans, structures deli neated initially and on- table, 
predicted dose, and adapted plan data are to be backed up for permanent storage and 
potential later analysis.  
 
6.10 Additional radiation therapy  
It is permissible for radiation therapy to be delivered to lesions other than those that are 
treated on this study.  This could be to other lesions that are present at the time that 
SABR is delivered as part of this study, or new lesions that may appear after the 
completion of SABR on this study.  However, additional radiation therapy should be 
avoided that would directly overlap or be in proximity to a lesion that previously received 
radiation therapy on this study  that could significantly  increase the risk of potentially 
severe toxicity.  It is strongly recommended that additional radiat ion therapy not be 
delivered off study to lesions within the same organ or otherwise within 3 cm of a lesion 
treated on this study so that any toxicity related to study therapy can be accurately 
assessed.  Otherwise, if it is medically necessary to deliver  additional radiation therapy 
off study, especially if there are no reasonable treatment alternatives, and if the treating 
physician believes that the risk of severe toxicity is reasonably low and justified by [CONTACT_558219].

9.2 Definitions for d isease assessment  
• Measurable lesions:  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension with longest diameter at least 10 mm.   
• Malignant lymph nodes:  A lymph node will be considered measurable if it 
measures at least 15 mm in short axis.   
• Non-measurable lesions:  All other lesions <10 mm  or lymph nodes <15 mm in 
short axis . 
• Target lesions:  Target lesions should be identified and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions include measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per 
organ and up to five lesions in total that are representative of all involved organs.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and are to undergo reproducible repeated measurements. If 
the largest lesion does not lend itself t o reproducible measurement,  it should not 
be considered a target lesion and instead the next largest lesion that can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the longest diameters for 
all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
• Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

Confidential  9.3 Definitions of Disease Response  
Definition of response in target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions  
• Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
• Local Progressive Disease ( LPD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions compared to baseline sum of target lesions,  taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm in addition to the relative increase of 20%.  
• Distant Progressive Disease (DPD) : The appearance of at least 1 new lesion.  
• Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient decrease to qualify as a PR or sufficient 
increase to qualify as PD , taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while 
on study.  
 
Definition of response in non- target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions  
• Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions  
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non-
target lesions

11. SAFETY ASSESSMENT  
 
Safety parameters evaluated during this study will include AEs, vital signs, physical 
examination findings and clinical laboratory values.  All safety parameters will be 
performed in accordance wit h the study calendar (S ection 8 .4). 
 
11.1 Adverse Event definition, Assessment  and Reporting  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
subject including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.    
The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs  related to t he 
radiation therapy specifically delivered on this study .  It should be noted that additional 
radiation therapy is permitted by [CONTACT_558224]; the treating physician should use best clinical judgment about 
whether any AE may be  related specifically to the treatment delivered on study.  
 
The Investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential 
or new worsening AEs as specified in the Schedule of A ssessment and more frequently  
if clinically indicated.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) will be graded and recorded throughout the trial  using the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.[ADDRESS_732903] 
one of the following for each AE:  
 
• Definitely related:  There is a definite relationship between study treatment and 
the AE .  An alternative cause is highly unlikely.  There is a strong time- based 
relationship between study treatment and the AE.   
• Probably related:   There is a reasonable probability that the AE is likely to have 
been caused by [CONTACT_204282].  The AE has a ti mely relationship to the study 
Protocol  # 2020- CHU- 002     Version 7.0, dated 30  AUG 2022  
 
 
Page 33 of 43 
Confidential  treatment and follows a known pattern of response, but a potential alternative 
cause is possible.  
• Possibly related:   There is a possible relationship between the AE and study 
treatment.  There may not be a known pattern of response and an alternative 
cause is more likely.  A possible relationship between the AE and study 
treatment cannot be reasonably ruled out.  
• Unrelated : There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study 
treatment and the AE.  For example, the unrel ated AE may be due to disease 
progression and not study treatment.  
 
All AEs, regardless of the source  of identification  (e.g., physical examination, laboratory 
assessment , or reported by [CONTACT_102]), will be collected and recorded in the eCRF, 
upon initiation of treatment and for a minimum of 100 days after completion of radiation 
therapy or until resolution or stabilization or reported as SAEs if they become serious . 
 
11.2 Serious adverse event definition and r eporting 
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is an AE occurring during any study phase that fulfills 
one or more of the following criteria:  
 
• Results in death;  
• Is immediately life -threatening;  
• Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above  
 
It is important to note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a planned medical/surgical procedure 
or disease treatment  is not considered a SAE.  
 
Only SAEs  assessed by [CONTACT_558222] -specif ic procedure or 
therapy will be collected and reported .  
 
The investigator at each site must review source documentation and describe pertinent 
information, provide a causality assessment of the event documented in OnCore. The 
SAE form generated in OnCore must be printed,  signed and date d by [CONTACT_093] .  
 
The study team will  submit all SAEs to the MCI Multisite Research Program by [CONTACT_414581]: 
[EMAIL_10592]  within [ADDRESS_732904] the site study team  to obtain further information.

If an ongoing SAE change in its intensity or relationship to study treatment  or if new 
information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 72 
business hours to MCI Multisite Research Program using the same procedure used for 
transmitting the initial SAE report.  
 
Any local incident , experience or outcome that is (a) unanticipated in terms of nature, 
severity, or freq uency given the research procedures that are described in the protocol -
related documents, such as the IRB approve protocol and informed consent document; 
and the charact eristics of the subject population being studied; and (b) Suggest that the 
research places subject(s) or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research, are considered 
Unanticipated Pr oblems (UPs) involving risks to subjects or others.  
 
All Safety Reports that meet the following criteria are considered UPs involving risk to 
subjects: Unexpected, related or possibly related to participation in the research as 
determined by [CONTACT_558225].

13.1 Evaluation of s tudy objectives  
13.2 Primary objective s 
The point estimate for feasibility will be reported as a binary variable with its 95% 
confidence interval.  Feasibility will be achieved if all are true:  
• Successful completion of treatment to each lesion within 3 working days of 
intended treatment completion  
• Successful completion of treatment to each lesion within 90 minutes from the 
patient entering the treatment room until treatment completion. Any machine 
downtime during treatment delivery should be recorded and will not be included 
when assessing the time for completion of treatment.  
• Image guidance verification of treatment delivery within 5 mm of the planned 
delivery  
 
The point estimate for tolerability will be reported as a binary variable with its 95% 
confidence interval.  Tolerability will be achieved if all are true:  
 
• No greater than 4 of 30 patients experience grade 3 or higher acute toxicity 
within 90 days of completing SABR  
• No grade 5 toxici ty is attributed to SABR  
 
13.3 Secondary  objectives  
1-year local control (LC) will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and will be 
estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method along with the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval from the time of study treat ment  
 
1-year overall survival (OS) will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method along with 
the corresponding 95% confidence interval from the time of study treatment  
 
The proportion of patients who experience acute grade 3 or higher toxicity attributable to 
SABR will be determined along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval .  For 
patients receiving SABR to multiple lesions, acute toxicity will be determined fro m the 
date of the initiation of SABR.   
 
Patient -reported quality of life will be determined using the FACT -G survey instrument 
prior to and after SABR.

Following criteria will be implemented for this feasibility study to advance to a phase II/III 
trial: 
 
1. Grade ≥[ADDRESS_732911] 80%  
 
With a sample size of 30, if the true underlying grade 3 toxicity rate is 10.5%, the 
probability of no greater than 15% of patients in the sample (maximum 4 out of 30) 
suffering a grade 3 or higher acute toxicity is 80%. In other words,  if the true underly ing 
grade 3 toxicity rate is 10.5%, the probability of satisfying the specified tolerability 
threshold for escalation to a phase II/III trial is 80%. If the true underlying grade 3 
toxicity rate is 21.4%, the probability of no greater than 15% of patients (maximum 4 out 
of 30) should suffer a grade 3 or higher acute toxicity is 20%. In other words,  if the true 
underlying grade 3 toxicity rate is 21.4%, the probability of satisfying the specified 
tolerability threshold for escalation to a phase II/III trial is 20%.  
 
With a sample size of 30, if the true underlying feasibility rate is 83.9%, the probability of 
at least 24 out of 30 patients satisfying the feasibility criteria is 80%. In other words,  if 
the true underlying feasibility rate is 83.9%, the probabi lity of satisfying the specified 
feasibility threshold for escalation to a phase II/III trial is 80%. If the true underlying 
feasibility rate is 71.3%, the probability of at least 24 out of 30 patients satisfying the

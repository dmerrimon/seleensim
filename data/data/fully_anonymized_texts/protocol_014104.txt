 3 SYNOPSIS    . 
Protocol Number :  ACH -CYT -09 
Sponsor: Achieve Life Sciences  
Title of Study:  A Multicenter, Double -blind, Randomized, Placebo -controlled Phase 2b 
Trial of Cytisine in Adult Smokers  
Clinical Phase : Phase 2b 
Study Population: Male or female subjects ≥18  years who are daily cigarette smokers 
intending to make a quit attempt during the study.  
Rationale: ( -)-Cytisine is a naturally occurring plant -based alkaloid, isolated from seeds of 
Cytisus laburnum  (Golden chain ), that is believed to reduce the severity of nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms while inhibiting nicotine’s effects by [CONTACT_655007] (nAChRs) in the brain . Cytisine administered at the 1.5  mg dose has been used as 
a smoking cessation drug since the 1960’s in Central and Eastern European countries. 
Previous studies dating from decades ago to support use in Central and Eastern Europe , and 
more recent studies  conducted to Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), have shown that cytisine 
can be effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_176043] . The titration schedule for the  
commercial product comprises  a gradual reduction in the number of tablets per day from  
[ADDRESS_878951] the logistics and planned Phase 3 
procedures, including compliance using var ious blister packaging, as well as the general 
effectiveness of  cytisine treatment and  the intended behavioral support in overall smoking 
cessation rates for subsequent Phase 3 sample size determination s. 
This Phase 2b trial is being conducted at sites within the [LOCATION_002] (US) to evaluate cytisine dos age and administration schedules within a 25- day treatment period. Study arms 
will consist of the commercial 1.5  mg dose/titration schedule that is marketed in European 
countries, a higher dose of 3.0 mg following the marketed titration schedule, 1.5 mg and 
3.0 mg dose s using a n initial three times a day (tid) schedule and respective placebo arms  
for either  schedule . The study will evaluate efficacy based on the overall reduction in the 
number of cigaret tes smok ed during the various study treatment dosing/ schedules as well as 
evaluate general compliance and safety profiles compared  to the respective placebo arms 
(i.e. the marketed titration schedule or a simplified tid schedule). Results will also be used  
to aid defining Phase [ADDRESS_878952] -randomization.

Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 4 Objectives:  
Efficacy Objective s:  
1. Assess whether subjects randomized to cytisine, administered using the commercial 
titration  schedule, have a greater overall reduction in cigarette smoking during the 
study treatment period (Day  1 – 25) compared to subjects randomized to the same 
titration  schedule  of a placebo . 
2. Assess whether subjects randomized to cytisine, using a simplified tid schedule, 
have a greater overall reduction in cigarette smoking during the study treatment 
period (Day  1 - 25) compared to subjects randomized to the same tid sc hedule  of a 
placebo . 
Other Efficacy Objectives   
(to include comparisons for  1.5 mg or 3.0 mg dose s versus placebo when given as the 
commercial  25-day titration schedule  and for the tid treatment schedule  as well as 
comparisons between the commercial  25-day titration versus  tid treatment schedules ): 
1. Assess the probability of abstinence from Week [ADDRESS_878953] -randomization in 
subjects randomized to cytisine as compared to subjects randomized to placebo . 
2. To compare cytisine and placebo arms on initi al quit rates during study treatment, at 
Week 4 (End of Treatment) and on 7- day point prevalence abstinence at Week 5, 
Week 6, Week 7, and Week 8.  
3. Among subjects abstinent at Week 4, compare time to failure to maintain abstinence 
through Week [ADDRESS_878954] -reported outcomes (e.g. anxiety, 
withdrawal symptoms, depression, tobacco craving, alcohol use) with the reduction in cigarette smoking during the study Treatment Period, as well as smoking 
cessation ou tcomes at Week 4 (End of Treatment) and from Week [ADDRESS_878955]’s nicotine metabolite  ratio (NMR) with 
the reduction in cigarette smoking and smoking cessation outcomes . 
Safety Objectives :  
To evaluate overall safety profile s of cytisine when administered at 1.5 mg or 
3.0 mg, using the 25- day commercial titration or simplified tid schedules, compared 
to placebo.  
Study Design:   
This will be a six-arm, multi- center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, Phase 
2b study conducted in male or female adults who are daily cigarette smokers, intending to quit smoking, and are willing to set a quit date that is 5- [ADDRESS_878956] meet all requirements outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Subjects will be stratified at random ization by [CONTACT_181140] (18.5 to <25 kg/m2; 
25 to  <30 kg/m2; 30 to  <35 kg/m2). A total of approximately 250 subjects will be randomly 
assigned 2:1 to cytisine treatment and the respective placebo treatment as designated by [CONTACT_655008] (i.e. the comme rcial titrated schedule or the simplified tid schedule). The 
intended six treatment arms are as follows:  
Arm A     N=50  
1.5 mg cytisine dose using the comme rcial 25 -day titration schedule +behavioral 
support  
  
Arm B     N=50 
3.0 mg cytisine dose using the commerc ial 25 -day titration schedule+ behavioral 
support  
 
Arm C     N=25  
Placebo tablets using the commerc ial 25 -day titration schedule+ behavioral support  
  
Arm D      N=50  
1.5 mg cytisine dose for 25 days using a simplified tid schedule+ behavioral support  
  
Arm E      N=50 
3.0 mg cytisine dose for 25 days using a  simplified  tid schedule+ behavioral support  
  
Arm F      N=25  
Placebo tablets for 25 days using a  simplified  tid schedule +behavioral support  
 
Each randomized subject will receive twenty -five (25) days treatment either using the 
commercial titration schedule ( i.e. decreasing daily tablet s over the 25 days ) or a simplified 
tid version of the schedule. Smoking status assessments will begin on Day 1 and will 
continue through study treatment by [CONTACT_655009] -of-Treatment visit on Week 4 (Day 27± [ADDRESS_878957] -randomization). 
Smoking cessation status will then be assessed weekly over a [ADDRESS_878958]’s self -report of abstinence with biochemical verification (expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559])

Study Procedures:  
Prior  to taking part in the trial, subjects  will be provided  with an informed consent  
document outlining study requirements and procedures. Subjects will be given adequate 
time to review, discuss, and decide  whether  they wish  to participate.  
Subjects providing signed informed consent will be assessed during the Screening Period to determine their eligibility for the trial. If eligible, subjects will be required to attend a clinic visit prior to randomization in order to establish a quit date that will in turn determine the

Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 9 Subjects will be assessed for efficacy (numb er of cigarettes smoked daily during treatment 
as well as smoking cessation status  by [CONTACT_6270] -report of abstinence with biochemical 
verification (expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559]) during the follow -up assessment s at W eek 5, 6, 7 and 8).  
Subjects will be assessed for safety (vital signs, adverse event reporting and concomitant 
medications) at each clinic visit, starting on Day 2 of treatment and ending at the Week 8 
visit (Note: clinic will contact [CONTACT_655010] 1 of treatment to assess for 
reported adverse events) . In addition to the above safety assessments , hematology and 
chemistry assessments will be made during treatment (Days 2, 3, 6, 12, 16, 20 and 27) and again at the Week 8 visit. Subjects presenting with clinically significant laboratory findings or any adverse event of moderate severity (or higher), regardless of attribution, on the Day 
[ADDRESS_878969] be scheduled for an additional safety visit on Day 21 ( ±1 Day).  Any adverse 
event  or abnormalities  considered  to be clinically  significant  by [CONTACT_655011].  
Statistical Considerations:  
Analysis Sets  
Screening  Analysis  Set: The Screening  Analysis  Set is defined as all subjects  who give 
written  informed  consent  and have entered screening. Analyses will be restricted to 
presentation of baseline data and reasons for non- participation as contrasted to those 
randomized. 
Safety  Analysis  Set: The Safety  Analysis  Set (SAS)  is defined as all randomized subjects  
who take at least one dose of study drug.  
Efficacy Analysis Set: The All Randomized Analysis Set (ARS) is based on the ‘intention-
to-treat’ principle and will include data from all randomized smokers.  
Efficacy  outcomes  
The primary outcome Y is the percent of expected cigarettes smoked computed for each 
subject as follows:  
Let N=total of number of cigarettes smoked each day over period from 1 to 25 days.  
Let R =representation of the average number of cigarettes smoked daily over the 7- day 
screening period as baseline.  
Let T= number of post -randomization days where number of cigarettes smoked is recorded. 
Compute Y=100*N /(T*R) 
The denominator is the expected number of cigarettes that would have been smoked without 
interventio n over the days where the number of cigarettes smoked is recorded, and the 
numerator is 100 times the actual number of cigarettes smoked (the purpose of the 100 factor is to convert to a percent).  
Statistical  methods  
This study will be analyzed without spe cific statistical criteria. The overall goal is to obtain 
effect and conduct estimates to inform the design of future studies.

Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 10 The primary comparisons are: A versus C, B versus C, D versus F, and E versus F 
(comparison of active arms to the associated plac ebo arm).  
The primary analyses will include all randomized subjects by [CONTACT_141585] (intent -to-
treat analysis). The four primary comparisons will be based on analysis of variance with 
main effects arm (2 levels for the arms to be compared) and BMI class (3 level stratification as previously specified), and with covariate of baseline cigarettes. Sensitivity analyses will 
include the assessment of the contribution of interaction terms and effect modification 
analyses.  
Analyses of data associated with other  objectives will be detailed  in a statistical analysis 
plan (SAP)  and will include comparisons for 1.5 mg or 3.0 mg doses versus placebo when 
given as the commercial 25 -day titration schedule and for the tid treatment schedule  as well 
as comparisons between the commercial 25 -day titration versus tid treatment schedules .

(-)-Cytisine (cytisinicline) is a plant- based alkaloid isolated from seeds of Cytisus laburnum L.  
(Golden chain ) and has been used as a smoking cessation drug since the 1960’s in Central and 
Eastern Europe, marketed as  ).[ADDRESS_878981] been treated with  The molecular structure of cytisine has 
s
imilarities to nicotine and acetylcholine (ACh). Nicotine addiction results, at least in part, from 
its interaction with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine r eceptors (nAChRs). Both cytisine and 
nicotine compete for these receptors.2-4 Cytisine has high affinity and specificity for neuronal 
nicotinic (α 4β2) receptors.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_160942], cytisine has not been market-approved for use outside Central and 
Eastern  Europe. This may, in part, be explained by  [CONTACT_655013], although not in English.[ADDRESS_878982] with nAChRs in the central nervous system ( CNS ). 
Although many smokers attempt to quit smoking, few succeed without pharmacological 
supportive treatment.  
Tobacco smoking  contributes to some 7 million premature deaths each year worldwide.
7 It is 
highly addictive, with more than 95% of unaided att empts at cessation failing by 6 months.8 
Every year that a smoker delays quitting beyond the mid-30s, there is an estimated 3 months 
reduction in life expectancy.9 
Although nicotine is primarily responsible for the addictive properties of cigarette smoking, 
tobacco smoke also contains several hundred gaseous substances and several thousand 
compounds. There is increasing evidence that the presence of carbon monoxide in cigarette 
smoke plays a role in cardiovascular disease and that tar is a major factor in respi[INVESTIGATOR_654979].10 Nicotine, of which 1 to 3 mg is typi[INVESTIGATOR_654980], is a 
peripheral vasoconstrictor and a sympathomimetic stimulant, which also leads to improvement 
in mood and attention. 
1.3. Treatments for Smoking Cessation   
The pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_654981] ( NRT ) and two non -nicotine containing medications: 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (Zyban

bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_654982] r to have about equal efficacy.11,[ADDRESS_878983] s stop smoking by [CONTACT_655014], withdrawal 
symptoms, and mood changes. Available over -the-counter and prescription- only NRT products 
include : chewing gums, lozenges, transdermal patche s, nasal sprays and inhalers. The purpose of 
all NRT products is to achieve a sufficient plasma concentration of nicotine (and hence 
concentration of nicotine at central nAChRs) and so  reduce craving for nicotine derived from 
cigarette smoke. However, the efficacy of NRT (expressed as a pooled Relative Risk (RR ) 
compared with placebo treatment) is limited (overall RR 1.60).12 In general, the delivery of 
nicotine from NRT products is relatively slow, and the pharmacokinetic profile does not 
resemble that of cigarettes: the time to peak plasma concentration (T max) tends to be longer for 
NRT, and the C max is not characterized by a sharp peak, but by a lower and flatter peak. Thus, the 
smoker does not have the same nicotine experience with NRT products that they do  from 
smoking. Although there do not appear to be safety concerns for NRT usage, the relatively poor response to NRT pr oducts as aids to smoking cessation limits their effectiveness as treatment.  
Combining NRT (e.g. oral and patch) has been shown to increase effectiveness.
13 Side effects of 
NRT products include: nausea, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, fast or irregular heartbeat, mouth problems with the lozenge or gum, and redness or swelling of the skin around the patch.

Varenicline was synthetical ly developed as a new class of α 4β2 nicotine receptor partial agonists, 
in part, using ( -)-cytisine as the structural starting point.[ADDRESS_878985] at 
nicotine receptors and acts as a nicotine substitute leading to a gradual decrease in the smoker's physical and psychological dependence on cigarettes. In a recent Co chrane analysis report 
detailing 6 -month abstinence rates, varenicline was found to be more effective than placebo 
(overall RR=2.25) or bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (overall RR=1.39).
[ADDRESS_878986] common side effects of 
varenicline  (>5% or twice the rate seen with placebo) include nausea, abnormal (vivid, unusual, 
or strange) dreams , constipation, flatulence, and vomiting. In addition, the Prescribing 
Information for varenicline cites other possible serious side effects and risks including new or 
worse ning mental health problems such as changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, or depressed 
mood. Other warnings and precautions include new or worsening seizures, accidental injury 
(e.g., trouble driving or operating heavy machinery), cardiovascular events (new or worsening 
cardiovascular symptoms), allergic hypersensitivity reactions, serious skin reactions, and nausea.  
The recently published, international trial (referred as the EAGLES trial15) was a large 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled and active- controlled (nicotine patch) trial 
comparing varenicline and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_490724] [ADDRESS_878987] frequent adverse events by [CONTACT_655016] (varenicline, 25%), insomnia (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 12%), abnormal dreams (nicotine patch, 12%), and headache (placebo, 10%). 
In summary, new treatments are still needed that are less costly, more effective, have an 
improved safety profile , or can more successfully treat individuals who have failed to quit using 
the above treatments.
  
2. RECENT EVIDENCE FOR CYTISINE AS A SMOKING 
CESSATION TREATMENT  
Cytisine has recently  been evaluated u sing the commercial 25 -day titration schedule  in two large 
randomized Phase 3 clinical trials that were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) in more than 2,000 participants. The overall objectives in these trials were to confirm the 
efficacy  and safety of cytisine according to current clinical development standards. 
The Phase 3 trial (  Smoking C essation, or TASC5 trial) was sponsored by [CONTACT_655017] C ontrol Studies and evaluated cytisine versus placebo in [ADDRESS_878988] (Department of 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_654987], University College London) and was funded by a grant from 
the National Prevention Research Initiative, including contributions fro m Cancer Research [LOCATION_006], 
Medical Research Council, [LOCATION_008] Department of Health, and others. The results of the TASC trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011.
5 The 
Relative Risk (RR) for sustained 12 -month abstinence was 3.4 for cytisine compared to placebo 
(8.4% cytisine arm compared to 2.4% placebo arm ; P<0.001). The RR for sustained 6-month 
abstinence was 2.9 (10.0% cytisine arm compared to 3.5% placebo arm;  P<0.001). Cytisine was 
well tolerated with an increase in all-combined gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (although 
there was no significant difference in individual GI events between the arms). The safety profile of cytisine was simila r to that of a placebo, with no overall difference in the rate of side effects in 
the two arms.  Compliance (assessed at End of T reatment visit) showed that 44% of subjects 
randomized to cytisine took all doses as directed and 33% of subjects randomized to placebo were compliant with all doses.  
The second Phase 3 trial ( Cytisine As a Smoking C essation Aid , or CASCAID
6 trial) was 
conducted by [CONTACT_655018] -label trial that 
randomized 1,[ADDRESS_878989] combination NRT (patch plus 
gum or lozenges) for 8  weeks. Both treatment groups were offered low-intensity telephone 
behavioral support during trial treatment. The primary outcome measure was continuous self-
reported abstinence from smoking one month after a quit date. The RR for continuous one-month 
abstinence was 1.3 for cytisine (40% cytisine arm compared to 31% in the NRT arm; P<0.001). A secondary outcome included the RR for continuous six-month abstinence which was 1.4 for 
cytisine (22% cytisine arm c ompared to 15% in the NRT arm; P=0.002). Cytisine was generally 

Protocol ACH -CYT -09, [ADDRESS_878990] frequent adverse events were nausea and vomiting and sleep 
disorders. Overall, 53% of subjects randomized to receive cytisine were in compliance with the 
treatment schedule  (had taken 80 or more of the required 100 tablets). Subjects in the NRT group 
showed 67% compliance (using NRT at both 1 week and 1 month). The results o f the CASCAID 
trial, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2014, showed 
that cytisine was superior to NRT for smoking cessation and, specifically, that cytisine was 
1.43 times more likely than nicotine patches with gum or lozenges to help participants stop 
smoking and remain non -smokers for six months.6 
Both studies are  described in more detail within the Investigator’s Brochure . 
3. SAFETY OVERVIEW FOR CYTISINE  
3.1. Non-Clinical Studies  
The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health ( NCCIH ) designated cytisine 
as “a drug of national Public Health importance ” and, in collaboration, has sponsored a series of 
more recent pharmacology and toxicology studies in support of the cytisine IND and in 
preparation  for formal Phase [ADDRESS_878991], NCCIH has sponsored new non -clinical 
studies to current Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) that have included 28- day repeat dosing for 
toxicology  assessments in rats and dogs as well as two reproductive/developmental studies in 
rats. 
3.1.1. Summary of 28- Day Repeat Toxicology Studie s 
Daily oral dose administration of cytisine  in Sprague Dawley rats at 5 or 2 0 mg/kg/day for 28 
consecutive days resulted in clinical signs, such as drooling, in a dose dependent manner. Other clinical signs were only seen in the 2 0 mg/kg group including ruffled fur, hypoactivity, shoveling 
behavior s, and ataxia. Decreases in food consumption and body weight gain were obse rved in 
animals treated with 2 0 mg/kg of cytisine. No cytisine -related macroscopic and microscopic 
findings were observed. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL ) of cytisine i s considered 
to be approximately 2 mg/kg/day when given orally for 28 consecutive days in rats. This would 
calculate to an estimated Human Equivalent Dose ( HED ) of 0. 3 mg/kg (i.e. 21 mg for a 7 0 kg 
human) when cytisine is administered for 28 consecutive days. 
Daily oral dose administration of cytisine via capsules in Beagle dogs at 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg/day 
for 28 consecutive days resulted in adverse effects. The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) was 
considered to be greater than 1 m g/kg/day but less than 2 m g/kg/day. Although emesis, drooling 
and diarrhea were observed in some animals treated with 0.5 mg/kg cytisine, the severities were 
mostly slight and not dose -limiting clinically; therefore, the NOAEL  was slightly less or at 
approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day following 28 days oral administration. This gives an estimated 
HED of 0.28 mg /kg (i.e. 20 mg for a 7 0 kg human) should cytisine be  administered for 28 
consecutive days  (Note: cytisine is administered for 25  days using a descending dose titration 
schedule ). 
Based on the  findings in both the 28- day rat and 28- day dog toxicology studies, the established 
commercial dose of 1. 5 mg 
× 6 doses/day (maximum total exposure of 9  mg/day for the first 
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, 15 April  2019, Ver 3 .0  
Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 21 3 days of treatment) is approximately half that of the estimated HED of ~2 0 mg/day for humans. 
The planned higher 3 m g/dose for this study yields a maximum total exposure of 1 8 mg/day for 
the first 3 days of treatment. This again is below the calculated HED based on all of the studies 
as shown in Table  1.

3.1.2. Summary of Reproductive/Developmental Studies  
The study titled “Combined Fertility and Embryo fetal Development Toxicity Study in Rats with 
Toxicokinetics ” administered oral cytisine once daily to males for 10  weeks (initiating 28 days 
prior to mating) and to females for 14 days prior to mating, during mating, and through Gestation 
Day ( GD) 17. Reproductive assessment for 10 males/group include d sperm assessments with 
sample collection for evaluation of motility and total sperm count. Females were  sacrificed with 
caesarian section on GD  21 with uterine contents examined  and a ny grossly abnormal cervical, 
thoracic and abdominal viscera noted. The placenta, amniotic sac, number of live fetuses, 
number of early or late resorptions, and number of corpora lutea and any abnormalities were also 
recorded. Fetuses were  evaluated for gross, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities.  This study has 
been completed and no treatment -related mortality or clinical s igns of toxicity were observed. 
There was also no evidence of treatment -related effects on mating, cyclicity, impaired fertility or 
embryofetal development.  
The study titled “Pre - and Post natal Development Toxicity Study in Rats, Including Maternal 
Function”  administered daily cytisine to t ime-mated females on Gestation Days  6 through 
Lactation Day  (LD) 20. Once daily, during the dosing interval (GD  6 through LD  20), detailed 
observations were done for each maternal animal at [ADDRESS_878992] -dosing. Prior to and after the 
dosing interval, detailed observations were  done at the same time that body weights were  taken. 
On LD  0, dat e of delivery, litter size, and the sex, weight, and observations of individual 
offspring were  recorded. During lactation on LD  4, 7, 14, and 21 (weaning), general 
development was recorded daily for individual offspring. Maturation phase procedures on 
LD 22-[ADDRESS_878993] on body weight/body weight gain was seen at the 
10.0 mg/kg dose level in both males and females. Systemic exposure was generally higher in 
females than in males regardless of dose, and  Cmax was slightly higher in females at the 1 0 mg/kg 
compared to males at the 1 0 mg/kg dose level.  
The non -GLP study titled “Embryotoxicity and Teratogenicity Study of Cytisine  in 
Rabbits” administered cytisine in sexually mature female rabbits. Af ter fertilization by a male, 
female rabbits were treated with cytisine daily. Fertilized animals were observed for symptoms 
of toxicity and weight gain. Female animals were sacrificed by [CONTACT_655019] [ADDRESS_878994]-implantation death of the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103], as well as reduced fetal weight, was not 
observed. No cases of external or visceral malformations and defects in fetal development were 
found. Malformations in the development of the skeleton and cranial bones as well as higher 
incidence rate of delayed ossification and variants in groups exposed to cytisine were also not observed.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more detail on GLP -conducted, non- clinical studies.  
3.2. General Safety of Cytisine as a  Marketed Product  
Cytisine (Generic designation cytisinicline)  has been marketed by , 
in Central and Eastern Europe for over [ADDRESS_878995] s. 
 maintains an independently- audited pharmacovigilance system overseen by a 
pharmacovigilance Qualified Person ( QPPV ). Periodic Safety Update Reports ( PSURs ) have 
been regularly provided to the relevant Eur opean authorities since 2005 (  
). It is estimated that the cumulative 
number of exposures to cytisine since 2005, and forming the denominator in the cumulative PSURs is over [ADDRESS_878996] new PSUR 
information. Sections  3.2.1 and 3.2.2 summarize the section titled “Undesirable Effects” in  the 
latest  Core Data Sheet.  
3.2.1. Summary of Safety Profile 
Since cytisine has a structural similarity to nicotine and is a partial agonist of nicotine acetylcholine receptors, the possible pharmacodynamic undesirable effects are manifested 
mainly as nicotine effects.  
In 6 placebo -controlled clinical trials (N=2 ,844) 1,[ADDRESS_878997] 
commonly reported adverse events in the cytisine group involved  the gastro- intestinal system: 

Protocol ACH -CYT -09, [ADDRESS_878998] frequently headache and 
dizziness, as well as somnolence and insomnia. However, statistical analysis did not reveal any 
significant difference in the nervous system adverse events between th e cytisine and placebo 
groups (P=0.12). 
3.2.2. Tabulated List of Adverse Reaction s 
Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and frequency 
category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (>1/10), common ( ≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

of therapy, are short -lived, mild -to-moderate intensity, and resolved spontaneously. It is not 
possible to dissociate these effects due to cytisine and those related t o nicotine withdrawal.

A total of 42 treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were reported by 16 (66.7%) subjects 
during the study; the severity was mild or moderate for all events, the majority of which were 
related to cytisine  (Table  5).  
When the number of subjects reporting TEAEs were compared, the same number of subjects 
reported at least 1 TEAE in each dose group (66.7%). However, there was a slight tendency for a great er number of TEAE’s to be reported for 3.0 mg cytisine versus 1.5 mg cytisine (24 events 
vs 18 events, respectively). There was also a tendency for more subjects reporting moderate events with 3.0 mg cytisine when compared to 1.5  mg cytisine (41.7% vs 16.7% respectively) 
(Table  5).  
There were no SAEs or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R). All TEAEs

Regarding preliminary pharmacodynamic results, although s mokers in the study were not 
required to have a designated or predetermined quit date, subjects overall in the trial had a 
significant reduction in number of daily cigarett es smoked by [CONTACT_57627]  (Figure  1). 
Mean baseline cigarette consumption in this 18 to 65 year age group was 16.25 (± 3.5) cigarettes 
per day with exhaled CO of 19.9 (± 7.3) ppm . By [CONTACT_655021] 25, subjects in the 
1.5 mg cytisine treatment group were smoking only 8% of the cigarettes compared to baseline 
cigarette smoking (i.e. a 92% reduction in daily cigarette smoking). S ubject s in the 3.0 mg 
cytisine treatment group were smoking only 5% of the cigarettes compared to baseline cigarette smoking (i.e. a 95% reduction in daily cigarette smoking).

Bioavailability  
ACH -CYT -01 titled “A Phase [ADDRESS_879003] of Food on the Bioavailability of Cytisine” 
evaluated [ADDRESS_879004] of food on the bioavailability of 
cytisine. The primary objective was to compare the bioavailability of  cytisine under fed and 
fasted conditions following administration of 3 mg cytisine (2 ×1.5 m g cytisine tablets) . 
Eligible subjects received a single -dose of 3 m g cytisine under f ed and fasted conditions over 
2 treatment periods . Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples (plasma and urine) were collected predose 
and up to [ADDRESS_879005] -dose (Day  2) during each period (17 plasma and 6 urine samples per period) 
for the measurement of plasma and urine cytisine concentrations . 
The study enrolled 24 subjects (1 1 males: 13 females) with a median age of 34  years (range 
19-53 years).  Two of three subjects who experienced emesis during the course of the study (both 
under fed conditions) were excluded from statistical analysis because emesis occurred at or before 2  times the median T
max. 
The fasted C max at 29.8 n g/mL was higher than the fed C max at 22.3 ng/mL. The T max under fed 
conditions (2.75 h) was delayed when compared to the T max under fasted conditions (0.75 h). 
However , both AUC 0-∞ and AUC 0-t were comparable under fed (167.5 and 160.2 h.ng/mL ) and 
fasted (172.6 and 165.9 h.ng/mL ) conditions , respectively.  0102030405060708090100

Cytisine showed rapid absorption after oral administration with over 80% of cytisine recoverable 
in urine within the [ADDRESS_879006]-dosing. Since  cytisine using  the commercial titration schedule 
will be  administered  frequently (i.e. 6 times daily, approximately every 2  hours) for the first 
[ADDRESS_879007] the overall treatment, primarily because the bioavailability measured as Area-
Under- the Curve ( AUC 0-∞ and AUC 0-t) showed equivalence between fed and fasted states . In 
addition, any food restrictions for such a frequent administration would not be practical and is 
not necessary given the minor food effect on C max and T max. 
Both studies are described in more detail within the Investigator’s Brochure . 
5. RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 
Previous studies dating decades ago and now more recent GCP studies have shown that cytisine can be effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_176043]. The recent trials have shown that cytisine was more effective than placebo as well as NRT for smoking cessation with an excellent safety 
profile that is consistent with the safety profile reported by [CONTACT_655022] (cytisine). It is not possible to effectively determine which reported 
adverse effects associated with cytisine treatment are an effect of the drug itself, due to nicotine 
withdrawal effects , or a combination of both. However , the risk/benefit for cytisin e appears very 
acceptable. Tobacco smoking contributes to some 7 million premature deaths each year 
worldwide.
7 Using cytisine as a smoking cessation aid could offer far more benefit with minor 
risks of treatment- related adverse events  when compared to the harms of continued smoking. 
Achieve Life Sciences and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) have  discuss ed 
general development plans for cytisine as a new chemical entity for aiding smoking cessation in 
the [LOCATION_002] ( US), which ultimately led  to filing an IND  in 2017. The titration schedule for 
the commercial product comprises a gradual reduction schedule in the number of tablets per day 
from [ADDRESS_879008] of the commercial 1.5  mg dose/titration schedule that is marketed in 
European countries, a higher dose of 3.0 mg using the marketed titration schedule, 1.5 mg and

 30 3.0 mg doses using a three times a day (tid) schedule and respective placebo arms. The study will 
evaluate efficacy based on the overall reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked during t he 
various study treatment dosing/schedules as well as compare compliance and safety profiles 
compared to the respective placebo arms (i.e. the marketed titration schedule or a simplified tid schedule ). 
Results from this study will also be used for defining Phase [ADDRESS_879009] a greater overall reduction in cigarette smoking during the study 
treatment period (Day  1- 25) as compared to subjects randomized to the same placebo 
titration  schedule.  
2. Assess whether subjects randomized to cytisine, using a simplified tid schedule, have a greater overall reduction in cigarette smoking during the study treatment period (Day  1- 25) as compared to subjects randomized to the same placebo  tid schedule.  
6.2. Other Efficacy Objectives  
Each of the following will include comparisons for 1.5 mg or 3.0 mg doses versus placebo when given as the commercial 25 -day titration schedule  and for the tid treatment schedule as well as 
comparisons between the commercial 25- day titr ation versus tid treatment schedules) . 
1. Assess the probability of abstinence from Week [ADDRESS_879010] -randomization in 
subjects randomized to cytisine as compared to subjects randomized to placebo . 
2. To compare cytisine and placebo arms on initial quit rate s during study treatment, at 
Week 4 (End of Treatment) and on 7- day point prevalence abstinence at Week 5, Week 
6, Week 7, and Week 8. 
3. Among subjects abstinent at Week 4, compare time to failure to maintain abstinence 
through Week [ADDRESS_879011] -reported outcomes (e.g. anxiety, 
withdrawal symptoms, depression, tobacco craving, alcohol use) with the reduction in cigarette smoking during the study Treatment Period, as well as smoking cessation 
outcomes at Week 4 (End of Treatment)  and from Week [ADDRESS_879012]’s nicotine metabolite  ratio (NMR) with the 
reduction in cigarette smoking and smoking cessation outcomes. 
6.3. Safety Objective s 
1. To evaluate overall safety profile s of cytisine when administered at 1.5 mg or 3.0 mg, 
using the 25- day commercial titration or simplified tid schedules, compared to placebo.

7.3.2. Efficacy Objectives  
Cytisine was developed and is  being marketed using a 25 -day titration treatment schedule for 
smoking cessation using a 1.5 mg dose. The primary efficacy objective of this Phase 2b trial is to 
assess the overall reduction in daily cigarette smoking during the s tudy treatment 
dosing/schedules compared to the respective placebo arms (i.e. the marketed titration schedule or 
a simplified tid schedule). Reduction in daily cigarette smoking was chosen as the primary 
efficacy outcome in order to better  define the effects of the different dosing and schedule s during 
the study treatment when such factors might have different daily effects on smoking behavior. A 
more simplified tid schedule was selected based on the pharmacokinetic profile for cytisine. In a 
recent pharmacokinetic trial ( ACH- CYT -01), the geometric mean elimination half -life of 
cytisine (in the presence of food  following administration of a 3  mg dose) was 4.63 h, but with a 
coefficient of variation of 24.3%. Given this variability, a tid administration schedule was chosen 
in order to ensure that  subjects with a half -life at the lower e nd of the expected range wi ll have 
adequate plasma concentrations of cytisine throughout the day.  
Other efficacy r esults from this study will be  used for defining Phase [ADDRESS_879018] -randomization.  
7.3.3. Blinding  
Although subjects and site staff will be unblinded to the treatment schedule (commercial titration vs. tid) due to packaging and dose timing requirements, this remains a double -blinded study with 
regard to cytisine v ersus placebo dosing and the design therefore protect s against subjective bias 
in reporting both efficacy and safety. Blinding will occur by [CONTACT_655024]. The S ponsor and site personnel will 
not have access to the treatment assignment for individual subjects (except as an emergency; 
refer to Section  7.3.4)  until the database is locked and final study analysis  at [ADDRESS_879019] be documented 
by [CONTACT_655025] S ponsor . 
Examples of emergencies include:  
• A life -threatening, unexpected adverse event that is thought to be rel ated to study 
drug and for which unblinding would change or influence treatment decisions. 
• Medication error, such as an accidental overdose, that would warrant unblinding in 
order to more effectively manage toxicity.  
7.4. Number of Subject s 
A total of 250 subjects w ill be randomized, with approximately 50 subjects in each of the  
4 treatment arm s and 25 subjects in each of the two placebo arms . The maximum number of 
subjects  that a single site is allowed to enroll, without consent of the S ponsor , is 50 
(appr oximately 20 % of the study total) . 
7.5. Randomization and Stratification  
Sites will utilize an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system for treatment arm assignment at randomization (Day 0). The IRT will stratify at randomization by [CONTACT_181140] (18.5 to 
<25 kg/m
2; 25 to <30 kg /m2; 30 to <35 kg /m2). Detailed instructions are provided in the Study 
Reference Manual .

will be destroyed  or returned to the depot or  Sponsor. 
10. PREVIOUS AND CONCOMI TANT MEDICATIONS  
All subjects will continue to receive any existing prescription medication. Every effort should be 
made to ensure that the regimen o f existing medications remain stable during the study.  
At the discretion of the Investigator, the use of non- study drug medications (either prescription 
or over -the-counter) may be given if clinically -indicated during the study . Full details of any new 
medications must be recorded in the subject’s Case Report Form (CRF).  
All concomitant medication (s) taken  during t he trial  and any changes (additions, deletions, dose 
changes)  must be recorded  in the CRF . This must include any use of non- cigarette nicotine 
products.

Treatment compliance will be monitored  during the [ADDRESS_879034] the 
number of  tablets taken and time taken . Subjects will be instructed t o bring their medication 
packs  (blister packs) to each clinic visit so that clinic staff can reconcile against the diary, 
record ing the number of tablets taken and the number of missed tablets. In addition, a text 
messaging system will be implemented that will provide each subject with reminder texts corresponding to the approxim ate time of dosing.  
12. STUDY PROCEDURES  
After providing signed informed consent, a ll subjects  will be evaluated for inclusion in the study 
within a  [ADDRESS_879035] day of treatment. Subjects will complete a clinic

12.2.5. Subject Diary  
A 7-day diary w ill be provided and collected during the screening period in order to capture the 
number of cigarettes smoked daily for 7 consecutive days. These data will be used to calculate the 
average number of cigarettes smoked per day in order to support Inclusion C riteria #2. In addition, 
a diary must be maintained by [CONTACT_655031] s during the Treatment Period. The diary will be configured into specific 
sections to support the above reporting b y the subject during the 25- day dosing schedule. S taff 
must review entries with the subject at each clinic visit and document on CRF. Data from t he 
diary will be reviewed at all clinic visits and collected as a source document at the Day [ADDRESS_879068] either a 
master ’s level or higher degree in a counseling profession (e.g. health educator, c hemical 
dependence counselor) or completed  a tobacco treatmen t training course of at least 4  hours . 
Evidence of the above qualification(s)  must be provided during the site qualification pr ocess. The 
site counselor s will be provided additional study -specific training prior to or during site initiation.  
All subjects will receive up to 12 behavioral support sessions by a qualified study site staff 
member, starting prior to randomization at the  Screen ing Visit #[ADDRESS_879069] sets their Quit 
Date, again at randomization and continuing through the Week 8 visit as outlined in ( Table 10). 
Site counselor(s) are to encourage subjects to continue study drug as scheduled even if they lapse 
and have a cigarette after their quit date. It is important during this “grace” period for the subjects to keep trying to quit as planned.  
Each behavioral session will be subject -driven and must include direct engagement with the 
subject about their efforts  to quit smoking . Each session should last up to 1 0 minutes  (Refer to 
Appendix  7). 
13. EFFICACY CRITERIA  
This study will follow general  crite ria that are applicable to previous and current trials of cessation 
aids where participants have a defined target quit date and  there is face- to-face contact [CONTACT_655032] .16  
This Phase 2b study will evaluate the timing and daily reduction in cigarette smoking during the various study treatment dosing/schedule s compared to the respective placebo arms (i.e. the 
commercial  titration schedule or a simplified tid schedule)  as the primary efficacy analyses . The 
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, 15 April 2019,  Ver 3.0   
Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 51 four primary comparisons will be based on analysis of  variance with main treatment effects,  BMI 
class (3 l evel stratification as previously specified), and with covariate of baseline cigarettes 
smoked. These analyses for r eduction in cigarette smoking based on cytisine dose (1.5 mg and 
3.0 mg relative to placebo) and administration schedule ( titration  vs tid) for  differences in timing 
or level of reduction in cigarette smoking during the treatment period . 
Secondary efficacy analyses for smoking cessation ([ADDRESS_879070] randomization) will also be determined and include the following standard c riteria  
which are also planned for the Phase 3 studies : 
1. Self-report of smoking abstinence since the last clinic visit ( continued abstinence) and over 
the prior 7 days at each clinic assessment  (7-day point prevalence abstine nce); 
2. Biochemical verifica tion of abstinence by [CONTACT_46761][INVESTIGATOR_654990] ; 
3. Use of an ‘intention -to-treat’ approach in which data from all randomiz ed smokers are 
included in the analysis ; 
4. Subjec ts with an unknown smoking status at the Week [ADDRESS_879071] t o follow up will be 
classified as failed to quit;  and 
5. Continually blinded to treatment allocation  during collection of follow -up data . 
14. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
All subjects  will be monitored for a dverse events  starting a t screening  (pre-existing), periodicall y 
during the Treatment Period (1 assessment via telephone on Day 1 and clinic evaluation s on Days

 52 14.1. Definitions 
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have attribution  with the 
treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product. 
An Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR) means all  untoward and unintended responses to a medicinal 
product related to any dose administered . The phrase ‘response to a medicinal product’ means that 
attribution  has at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out and is 
judged b y the investigator as at least possible (see definition below).  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  (UADR)/ Unexpected Adverse Event  (UAE) means an 
adverse reaction/event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable 
product informa tion, namely in the Investigator Brochure for an unauthorized investigational 
product or in the SmPC for an authorized product.  
The expected/unexpected status should be evaluated and assessed, by [CONTACT_1034], based on the reference safety information avail able since expectedness in Pharmacovigilance refers strictly to 
the information listed or mentioned in the applicable reference safety information and not to event (s) that might be anticipated from knowledge of the pharmacological properties of a 
substance  or because it was foreseeable due to the health status (e.g., age, medical history) of the 
study subjects . 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction  (SAR) is defined as an AE that 
results in any of the following:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening . 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212437] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect . 
• Is an important medical event that  requires medical in tervention to prevent any of the 
above outcomes . 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs : AEs that  meet all of the following criteria  will be classified as suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs ): 
• Serious . 
• Unexpected (i.e., is not consistent with the applicable product information e.g. 
Investigator's brochure for an unapproved IMP or SmPC for an authorised product) . 
• There is at least a reasonable possibility that there is attribution  between the event and 
the medicinal product . 
Important medical events  are those that  may not be immediately life -threatening, but may 
jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes 
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, 15 April 2019,  Ver 3.0   
Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 53 listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic br onchospasm, or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
The term “life -threatening”  in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that  hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe. For example, drug- induced hepatitis that resolves 
without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug -
induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654992]/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654993] a 
consequence of the event. It does not  refer to pre -planned elect ive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_654994] a pre- existing condition that has not significantly worsened, or to diagnostic 
procedures. 
14.2. Recording of Adverse Events  
All of the following details will be recorded in the subject’s CRF for each AE:  
• Full description of AE . 
• Date and time of onset . 
• Date and time of resolution . 
• Severity of event, to be assessed by [CONTACT_39595] , or their delegate,  in accordance with 
the definitions below . 
• Relationship to study drug  to be assessed by [CONTACT_39595] , or their delegate,  in 
accordance with the definitions below . 
• Action taken (if any) . 
• Outcome and details of any further follow -up. 
Adverse events documented in the CRF without a stop date at the Week [ADDRESS_879074] be followed 
until final resolution or until it is medically ju stifiable to stop fur ther follow up (e.g. a chronic 
condition has been reached ). Documen tation of adverse events should be updated as necessary.  
14.2.1. Grading Adverse Event Severity  
The following grades will be used by [CONTACT_655033]  (including 
clinically -significant laboratory AEs) as shown in Table 11. Only 1 severity grade will be used for 
each AE (e.g. mild -  moderate is not acceptable).  
Table  11: Adverse Event Severity  
Severity of AE  Definition  
Mild  No interference with activity  
Moderate  Some interference with activity requiring no or minimal medical intervention  
Severe  Prevents daily activity and requires medical intervention  
If an adverse event has multiple aspects, the aspect in the highest intensity will be graded. It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily 
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, 15 April 2019, Ver 3.0   
Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 54 serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe; however, may not be 
clinically serious . 
14.2.2. Assessment of Attribution  
The attribution  between an adverse event and study drug will be determined and documented by 
[CONTACT_655034], or their delegate , according to best medical judgment as shown in 
Table 12. 
Table  12: Assessment of Attribution  to Study Drug   
Category  Description  
Not Related  The event is definitely not associated with study drug .  
Unlikely  The event was most probably produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, and does not follow a known 
response pattern to study drug .  
Possible  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, 
but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therape utic intervention or concomitant therapy.  
Probable  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, 
and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy.  
Definite  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the investig ational product, 
and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, and either occurs immediately 
following study drug  administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] d rug. 
14.2.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE that occurs during the AE reporting period (randomization to Week 8) must be recorded 
and reported immediately. All SAEs including those that are ongoing at the end of the Week [ADDRESS_879075] be reported to the Sponsor or designee as soon as possible after the Investigator ( or delegate)  
has become aware of its occurrence. SAE form completion and reporting must not be delayed, 
even if all of the information is not available at the time of the initial contact.  
SAEs must be reported within 24 h of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_655035] . 
 
 
A  Pharmacovigilance Associate will notify the Sponsor and Sponsor's Responsible Physician of the SAE via email within 24  h of receipt of the initial SAE report.  
Additional information (follow-up) about any SAE unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarded by [CONTACT_11255] [ADDRESS_879076] the event:  
• Investigator name [CONTACT_506709] . 
• Subject number . 
• Subject initials . 
• Subject demographics . 
• Clinical event : 
− description. 
− date of onset . 
− severity . 
− treatment . 
− relationship to study drug ( attribution ). 
− action taken regarding study drug . 
• If the AE resulted in death:  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug) . 
− autopsy findings (if available) . 
• Medical history case report form (copy) . 
• Concomitant medication case report form (copy) . 
• Any relevant reports  (labo ratory, discharge, x -ray, etc.) . 
Subjects who have had an SAE during the AE reporting period (randomization to Week 8 visit) 
must be followed clinically until all parameters (including laboratory) have either resolved or been 
assessed as chronic.  
S[LOCATION_003]Rs should be  repor ted to the IRB (if applicable) and to the FDA  in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements  for expedited reporting . It is the S ite’s responsibility to report any S[LOCATION_003]R 
to their IRB and it is the S ponsor’s responsibility to report any S[LOCATION_003]R to the FDA.  
Full details of SAE handling and S[LOCATION_003]R reporting will be documented in a study specific reference 
manual  prior to the start of dosing.  
14.3. Laboratory 
14.3.1. Routine Laboratory Assessments  
Routine laboratory safety samples  will be analysed at screen ing and at each clinic visit as 
identified in ( Table 10)  for each subject  by a central laboratory . A decision regarding whether a 
result outside the reference range is of clinical significance or not shall be made by [CONTACT_655036].  Clinically significant abnormalities  occurring during 
the study will be recorded on the AE page. The refer ence ranges for laboratory parameters will 
also be entered in the database and filed in the Investigator site file.

14.4. Vital signs  
Systolic/diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate, and oral temperature m easurements will be recorded 
in a seated  position. Body weight will also be recorded. Height is to be  recorded at Screening 
Visit #1 for BMI calculation. 
14.5. Physical Examination

15. SAFETY MONITORING  
15.1.  Independent Data Safety Monitor  
Safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_655037] ( DSM ) who will be 
appointed for this study. The DSM will be an M.D. experienced in the treatment of adult smokers. 
The primary responsibility of the DSM will be to monitor for any unexpected safety risk for 
subjects on the protocol. The DSM will:  
• Review all S[LOCATION_003]Rs and SAEs  reported to the S ponsor. The S ponsor  will provide the 
DSM with a copy of any unexpected study drug -related SAE  Report Form within 
7 business days of receipt  by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor . The Medical Monitor (or designee) will also 
provide the DSM with copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a ll expedited SAE reports  submitted to regulatory 
agencies.  
• Perform p eriodic review s of specific safety data for the stud y (e.g. moderate  and higher 
adverse events ). 
The DSM may request unblinding of s tudy treatment based on a safety concern or specific 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs or SAE . All unblinding and the reason for unblinding will be documented. The Sponsor 
and sites will not be unblinded unless the DSM requests that individual or other unblinding occurs due to a saf ety concern.  
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, 15 April 2019,  Ver 3.0   
Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 57 16. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A major design feature of this study is blinding. The study will be unblinded only after database 
lock and at the time of final study analyses (i.e., when unblinding cannot induce bias in collection 
of data and inte rpretation of results ). 
Detailed statistical specifications are  to be  documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and 
this SAP will be developed and finalized prior to initiation of any study unblinding . 
16.1. Statistical Design  
This study will be analyzed without specific statistical criteria. The overall study intent  is to obtain 
effect outcomes and conduct estimates to further inform the design and plans for  Phase 3  studies.  
16.2. Efficacy Outcomes  
The primary comparisons will be : Arm A versus Arm C, Arm B versus Arm C, Arm D versus 
Arm F, and Arm E versus Arm F (comparison of active arms to the associated placebo arm).  
The primary outcome Y is the percent of expected cigarettes smoked computed for each subject as 
follows:  
Let N =total of number of cigarettes smoked each day over the treatment period from 1 to 25 days.  
Let R =representation of the average number of cigarettes smoked daily over the 7- day screening 
period as  baseline.  
Let T =number of post -randomization days where number of  cigarettes smoked is recorded.  
Compute Y  = 100×𝑁𝑁
𝑇𝑇×𝑅𝑅 
The denominator is the expected number of cigarettes that would have been smoked without intervention over the days where the number of cigarettes smoked is recorded, and the numerator is 100 times th e actual number of cigarettes smoked (the purpose of the 100 factor is to convert to 
a percent).  
The primary analys es will include all randomized subjects by [CONTACT_141585] (intent -to-treat 
analysis). The four primary comparisons will be based on analysis of variance with main effects 
arm (2 levels for the arms to be compared) and BMI class (3 level stratification as previously 
specified), and with covariate of baseline cigarettes  smoked. Sensitivity analyses will include the 
assessment of the contribution of interaction terms and effect modification analyses.  Analyses of 
data associated with other objectives will be specified in a statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
16.3. Study Size  
The trial size is based on projected realization of the effect size estimate for the primary outcome based on data from a Phase 1/[ADDRESS_879077] deviation, the estimated 
between -arm differences in the primary comparis ons can be estimated with a 95% confidence 
interval that is ± 8.3. 
The trial size will not have sensitivity for a dichotomous outcome  (e.g. smoking cessation as the 
secondary efficacy outcome),  other than for possibly large differences. For example, if the control 
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, 15 April 2019,  Ver 3.0   
Cytisine   CONFIDENTIAL  
 58 arm outcome is 12% (3/ 25 defined as successes), then the experimental arm will have a two -sided 
95% confidence interval for the probability difference that excludes zero when the success 
probability is 36% (8/ 50) or more (computation based on exact  confidence interval).  
16.4. Safety  Objective  
Safety assessments include reported adverse events , laboratory tests results, and vital signs.  
The profiles  of adverse  events  for the arms  with regard  to incidences  of treatment  emergent  
adverse events  will be assessed. Treatment  emergent  adverse  events  are defined  as those  events  
that appear  during  treatment  or are present  before  treatment  and subsequently  worsen.  
Laboratory, vital  signs,  and adverse event  data will primarily  be assessed for  clinical  safety.  Data 
will be listed  and summarized  for each treatment according  to measurement  time.  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA  dictionary . Coding includes system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT). All verbatim descriptions and coded terms will be listed for all AEs.  
Safety summaries are described in the SAP.  
17. REGULATORY AND ETHIC S CONSIDERATIONS  
17.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
This study protocol must be submitted to an  IRB for review and approval  prior to initiation . As 
this study will be conducted at multiple sites, it is expected that each site must submit and obtain approval from their designated IRB with preference towards use of a central IRB when at all possible. Before the investigational product can be shipped to the investigative site and before  the  
consenting and screening of subject s at the site, the protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
consent form, any advertising materials, any materials to be provided to the subjects for the proposed clinical study, and any other documents required by [CONTACT_655038] w and approval by [CONTACT_1201] . The Investigator must also ensure that the IRB 
reviews the progress of the study, if necessary, and renews its approval of the study (if ong oing) 
on an annual basis. Any member of the IRB who is directly affiliated with this study as an Investigator or as site personnel must abstain from the IRB vote on the approval of the protocol  
and associated documents . 
All amendments or revisions to the protocol must undergo review by [CONTACT_655039] . 
Amendments/revisions will be circulated to all participating sites with clear instructions regarding 
IRB r eview. Amendments will be submitted by [CONTACT_655040], and by [CONTACT_655041], EXCEPT when the 
amendment eliminates an immediate hazard to clinical trial subjects or is of a purely administrative nature.  
A copy of the IRB  approval letter must be forwarded to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s representative 
before the study is implemented. The approval letter must clearly state the protocol title and version that was reviewed , as well as any associated documents . The Investigator also must 
forward copi[INVESTIGATOR_654996].  
Protocol ACH -CYT -09, [ADDRESS_879078] comply with the Decl aration of Helsinki and 
its updates and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines and must have been approved by [CONTACT_13679]’s representatives (prior to review by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB) and the Investigator’s IRB. The Investigator or an authorized associate, who must be a physician, must 
explain the nature of the study and the treatment in such a manner that the subject  is aware of 
his/her rights and responsibilities, as well as potential benefits and risks. The Investigator is also  
responsible for answering any questions the subject  may have throughout the study and sharing 
any new information, in a timely manner, that may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to 
continue his/her participation in the trial.  
Subject s must also be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from 
the study at any time, without prejudice to their current or future care. Documentation of the discussion and the date of informed consent should be recorded in the subject ’s medical record or 
a study/clinic chart. Once all of their questions have been answered and they have voluntarily 
agreed to participate in the study, subject s will be asked to sign and date the Informed Consent 
Form.  
Subject s, or their legally authorized representa tives, must give informed consent in writing prior 
to the performance of any protocol -specific procedure. Subject s who cannot give informed 
consent (i.e. mentally incompetent subject s or those physically incapacitated such as comatose 
subject s) are not to be recruited into the study. Subject s who are competent but physically unable 
to sign the consent form may have the document signed by [CONTACT_655042]. 
A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form will be provided to the subject. 
17.4. Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigator must attempt to assure that the subject ’s confidentiality will be maintained within 
the limit of the law. Subject s will be identified by [CONTACT_655043] (or other code) on 
all documents submitted to the Sponsor. Subject s will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300].  
All records will be kept in a secure place in the clinical research site. Computer data entry and 
data review programs will be done using subject  numbers and initials (or other code) only. 
Clinical information  will not be released without written permission of the subject , as outlined in 
the subject  consent form. 
The Investigator must maintain a log of subject  names and identification codes.

tobacco treatmen t training course of at least 4  hours. 
At the Screen ing Visit #[ADDRESS_879094]’s quit date is chosen prior to 
randomization and that they are planning on trying to quit smoking . Site counselor(s) are to 
encourage subjects to continue study drug as scheduled even if they lapse and have a cigar ette 
after their quit date. It is important during this “grace” period for the subjects to keep trying to quit as planned. It is also important to reiterate to each subject that the purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the potential benefits of cytisine in  achieving abstinence even after a lapse or “slip” 
during study treatment because cytisine is thought to block the effects of nicotine. 
Subject s will be given the National Cancer Institute, “Clearing the Air” booklet, American Heart 
Associate “Managing Str ess” handout, and the American Thoracic Society, “What is Second and 
Third Hand Smoking?” handout at the randomization visit.  
Subjects will be given a list of 2 -3 U.S. websites ( e.g. www.smokefree.gov , 
www.cancer.org/healthy/stay -away -from -tobacco/guide -quitting -smoking , 
www.heart.org/en/healthy -living/healthy -living -lifestyle/quit- smoking -tobacco ) as resources . 
Subjects will receive  up to 12 behavioral support sessions  by a qualified staff member , starting at 
the Screen ing Visit #2, again  at randomization and then continuing through each clinic visit up to 
the Week [ADDRESS_879095]. Subjects will be encouraged to “keep trying” if they experience set -backs or a “lapse” during 
treatmen t. Each session should last up to 10 m inutes. 
Practical counseling (problem solving/skills training) s hould be given. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_84946] , but are 
not limited to , the following:  
• Abstinence –Striving for total abstinence is essential. Not even a single puff after the 
quit date. 
• Past quit experience– Identify what helped and what hurt in previous quit attempts. 
Build on past succ ess. 
• Anticipate triggers or challenges in the upcoming attempt –Discuss challenges/triggers 
and how the  subject  will successfully overcome them (e.g., avoid triggers, alter 
routines).

limiting/abstaining from alcohol while quitting. (Note that reducing alcohol intake 
could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_655005] -dependent persons ). 
• Other smokers in the household–Quitting is more difficult when there is another 
smoker in the household. Subject s should encourage housemates to quit with them or 
to not smoke in their presence.  
• Recognize danger situati ons–Identify events, internal states, or activities that increase 
the risk of smoking or relapse (i.e. smoking cues and availability  of cigarettes, 
experiencing urges)  
• Develop copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] –Identify and practice copi[INVESTIGATOR_655006]. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], these skills are intended to cope with danger situations (i.e. learning to avoid temptation and triggers)  
• Provide basic information–Provide basic information about smoking and successful quitting.  
Worksheets containing questions will be provided and may be administered  by [CONTACT_655050]/foster open conversation with the subject and may be used at the start or during the study . 
These questions do not need to be used at every visit. They are provided as guidance if the 
subject has difficulty opening up a discussion.  
Potential questions are:  
• What is my motivation for quitting?  
• Why is it important for me to quit right now?  
• What are the biggest barriers I will encounter without a cigarette?  
• What are some al ternatives I can do when I face these barriers instead of smoking?  
• How will I handle withdrawal symptoms?  
• What are my stress triggers for cravings?  
• How will I deal with these stressors instead of smoking?  
• What are my  biggest concerns/fears about quitting smoking?  
• How will I remember to take my medication as directed?  
At the end of each visit, the subject will be reminded of supplementary information for additional 
support including: st udy staff contact [CONTACT_3031], Q uitline information (1 -800-QUIT -NOW), or 
additional websites.  
Any questions regarding the medication or protocol must be answered by [CONTACT_114007]. Documentation of the behavioral support must be captured in the subject’s source document.

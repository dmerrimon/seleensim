Principal Investigator:       [INVESTIGATOR_878096] :    The use of CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System for residual Barrett's Esophagus Post ablation; a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Protocol version number and date:      Version 1 June 2014 
 
Purpose  
 Hypothesis:  Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a commonly used method for eliminating Barrett’s esophagus (BE). RFA is highly effective, yet there is a set of patients who continue to have persistent dysplasia or intestinal me taplasia despi[INVESTIGATOR_878097], thus this population requires follow up endoscopic therapy with 
a different ablative modality such  as cryotherapy.  
 Aims, purpose, or objectives: 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the  C2 CryoBalloon Focal Ablation (510K 
cleared K131523, C2 Theraputics, Redwood City CA) in treating patients with persistent Barrett’s Esophagus (less than 2 cm) despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 2 or more serial R adio Frequency ablation or endoscopic mucosal resection treatment 
sessions.  
 Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
 Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is a pre-neoplastic condition formed by [CONTACT_878105] a specialize d intestinal mucosa. Its development is mostly associated with 
chronic injury from gastroesophageal reflux. BE is widely considered the leading risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocar cinoma (EAC). (1) In 2009 alone, EAC accounted for 14,500 deaths in the 
U.S.(2)  It is one of the fastest growing malignancies which carries a dismal prognosis of less than 15% survival 
in a 5 -year period.(3) 
 The development of ablative therapy for BE with high grade dysplasia (HGDDYS) aims to prevent neoplastic progression to EAC.  Several emerging endoscopic strategies have become attractive to gastroenterologists as standard esophagectomy portends 4% to 12% perioperative mortality with other long term c omplications. (4) 
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), in spi[INVESTIGATOR_878098], requires further endoscopic skills and procedural time. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is another ablative technique. RFA employs bipolar electrodes, which deliver ablative energy to the tissue.(5) The latest results of the AIM Dysplasia Trial 10 at their 2 -year follow-up shows 85% and 83% eradication of dysplasia and intestinal 
metaplasia, respectively, after intention -to-treat analysis. (6)A t these rates, there is a set of patients who continue 
to have persistent dysplasia or intestinal metaplasia despi[INVESTIGATOR_878099] a 
different ablative modality such as cryotherapy.

Methods: D escribe, in detail, the research activities  that will be conducted under this protocol :   
 In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_878101]. During clinically indicated endoscopic procedures, the Barrett’s segment length, length and presence of islands or tongues of Barrett’s mucosa, mucosa abnormali ties (type and size)  will be documented. The battery- powered  Cryoballoon Focal Ablation System 
(CbFAS) is a 510K cleared disposable through- the-scope balloon- based catheter made of conformable material 
obviating the need for sizing. The balloon catheter wi ll place at the area of persistent visible Barrett’s mucosa (2 
cm. or less) for treatment  following standard endoscopic technique. Upon activation by [CONTACT_099], the 
balloon probe at the end of the catheter is simultaneously inflated and cooled with nitrous oxide.  The balloon probe comes in contact [CONTACT_878106]. Nitrous oxide is fully contained within the balloon.  The nitrous oxide gas exits the patient through the proximal end of the catheter. The part icipants will be here for clinically indicated endoscopy  and therapy. Patients will return in 3 months for 
clinically indicated endoscopy and surveillance of Barrett’s Esophagus and/or esophageal cancer. At that endoscopy the Barrett’s segment length, length and presence of islands or tongues of Barrett’s mucosa, m ucosa 
abnormalities (type and size) will again be documented  to evaluate results. Results of clinical histological 
specimens obtained at both endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_878102], high-grade dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, indefinite for dysplasia, non-dysplastic intestinal metaplasia, normal squamous mucosa and normal gastric mucosa as established guidelines will be  documented. Patient demographics, Endoscopy and Pathology r esults will be review in the Electronic 
Medical record including the GI Endoscopy database, MICS and Synthesis. Patients will be identified for participation from the GI Endoscopy database. Partic ipants may have up to three cryo ablation endoscopic 
procedures performed.

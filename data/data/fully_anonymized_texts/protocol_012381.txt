5 1. Introduction  
1.1 AZD4547 
Background: 
AZD4547 is a selective inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-
3 kinases. It exhibits an in vitro IC50 of <  5nM for FGFR1- 3 and has a 
significant ly lower potency for inhibition of FGFR4 insulin- like growth factor 1 
receptor (IGFIR) and kinase insert domain receptor (KFR) (i.e. vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor) [VEGFR]. AZD4547 has demonstrated potent 
anti-tumor effects in several human cancer cell lines dependent on FGFR1- 3 
including KMS11, KG1a, SNU16, RT112, NCI -H2077, NCI -H716 and SUM52PE  
and in xenograft models derived from these cell lines . 
AZD4547 has been evaluated in a phase I dose- escalation study which has 
recently completed acc rual ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This study established the safety, 
PK and PD properties of the drug and a recommended monotherapy dose of 80 
mg twice daily. Dose- expansion cohorts, which were tied to FGFR1 or FGFR2 
amplification as a biomarker, demonstrated activity w ith a small number of 
responses  in biomarker selected populations. AZD4547 has been evaluated in a 
Phase I SqNSCLC cohort  and in a phase II study in advanced gastric cancer. 
AZD4547 is currently being evaluated in studies in the US and in Europe aimed at evaluating its efficacy in biomarker selected populations, principally subjects 
with FGFR1 -3 amplifications, point mutations or fusions.  
Pharmacokinetics of AZD4547: 
Preliminary PK data are available from Studies D2610C00001 (single and 
multiple b id dosing of 20 mg to 200 mg AZD4547 oral suspension formulation 
and 120 mg to 200 mg AZD4547 tablet formulation) and D2610C00003 (a Phase 
I/IIa AZD4547 study in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant in estrogen 
receptor (ER+) breast cancer. Final reported data  are available for D2610C00002 
(single and multiple bi d dosing of 40 to 120 mg and qd dosing of 160 mg 
AZD4547 oral tablet formulation in Japanese patients) and D2610C00004 (an open label Phase IIa study in AZD4547 monotherapy versus paclitaxel in 
advanced gastric cancer).  
These studies showed that AZD4547 has a moderate rate of absorption, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (t Max) of 1 to 4 hours. Following 
a single dose of AZD4547, peak plasma concentrations declined with a 
consistent terminal elimination half -life (t1/2) across the dose- levels; mean value 
approximately 30 hours . The oral clearance was approximately 50 L/h and the 
oral volume of distribution was greater than total body water indicating that 
AZD4547 was well -distributed in the tissues.  
Safety : 
In the dose -escalation study  (Study D2610C00001) , dose- limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) have been reported for 7 patients: raised liver function tests (80 mg bd 
[suspension]), mucositis (120 mg bd [tablet]),  stomatitis (150 mg bd 
[suspension] ), uncontrolled phosphate levels (160 mg bd [tablet]), renal failure 
(200 mg bd [suspension]), renal failure (160 mg bd [tablet]),  and liver enzyme 
changes (200 mg bd [tablet]). The 160 mg bd dose was declared non-tolerated 
as 2/6 patients experienced DLTs . Rev. 7/16  
Rev. Add13  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAY131-W 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 16, [ADDRESS_423527] commonly 
reported AEs (overall; all doses in all parts of the study  [94 patients]) were 
constipation (43 [45.7%] patients); dry mouth (40 [42.6%] patients), stomatitis (39 
[41.5%] patients), diarrhea (33 [35.1%]  patients), alopecia (32 [34.0%] patients), 
decreased appetite (31 [33.0%] patients),  and vomiting (31 [33.0 %] patients).  
As of [ADDRESS_423528] been 49 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported 
in 25 patients; this includes 1 SAE (respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]) in 1 patient, which 
occurred  after the 28 -day follow -up period. Nineteen SAEs in 12 patients were 
considered by [CONTACT_342014]4547. 
Asthenia,  blood creatinine increased, chorioretinopathy, dehydration, dyspnea, 
general  physical health deterioration, renal failure, sepsis, and vomiting are SAE 
terms  reported on more than one occasion. 
In the gastric cancer monotherapy  vs. paclitaxel  study  (Study D2610C00004),  [ADDRESS_423529] commonly reported AEs (of any grade) 
reported for patients receiving  AZD4547 were: decreased appetite (16 [40.0%] 
patients), asthenia (11 [27.5%] patients), nausea (10 [25.0%] patients), 
constipation (10 [25.0%]  patients), stomatitis (10 [25.0%] patients), abdominal 
pain (9 [22.5%] patients), abdominal pain upper (9 [22.5%] patients), dry mouth 
(9 [22.5%] patients), and  vomiting (8 [20.0 %] patients).  As of [ADDRESS_423530] -treatment SAEs had been reported  for 8 patients receiving 
AZD4547. AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported for 5 
patients and  2 patients in the AZD4547 and paclitaxel groups, respectively. In the 
AZD4547 group these were: arterial disorder (1 patient; fatal; not considered by 
[CONTACT_342015] i nvestigator to be related to treatment), blood bilirubin increased (1 
patient),  intestinal hemorrhage (1 patient; fatal; not considered by [CONTACT_342016]), retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] 
(RPED; 1 pa tient),  and RPED and bile duct obstruction (both terms in 1 patient). 
On the basis of these the studies , the following are considered AEs associated 
with AZD4547: Alopecia, blood creatinine increased, diarrhea, dysgeusia, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_342002] (including palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome), hair and eyelash disorders, hyperphosphatemia, nail disorders, 
retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_6678] ( RPED) , stomatitis, and transaminases  
increased.  
More specifically the following adverse events are expected to occur at a frequency greater than 20%: retinal detachment (usually preceded by [CONTACT_342017]), constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, oral mucositis, 
vomiting, fatigue, and anorexia. In addition, ALT and/or AST elevations and 
hyper phosphatemia may occur with a frequency >20%. 
Less likely adverse events include xerophthalmia, keratitis, retinopathy, 
abdominal pain, nausea, altered taste, alopecia, dry skin, hand foot syndrome, 
nail discoloration and dystrophy. In addition, elevations  in the ALP and serum 
creatinine, and decreases in the neutrophil count and ejection fraction may occur. Rarely QT prolongation may occur. Also, since AZD457 is  a selective  inhibitor  of 
the fibroblast  growth  factor  receptor  and may alter bone maturation /metabolism , 
there is a theoretical risk that patients under [ADDRESS_423531] not included patients younger than 25 y ears of age.

7 Efficacy: 
There are only sparse clinical data response to AZD4547 in FGFR amplified 
tumours as determined by [CONTACT_4656]. This is based on two trials that did not meet this 
endpoint in ORR in the relevant histologies (ASCO [ADDRESS_423532] & 2620) . 
Responses have been documented in patients treated with JNJ42756493 or [COMPANY_001] FGFR inhibitors (2 of 5 patients treated with BJG398 (Personal 
communication, [COMPANY_008], Oct 2014). Responses in tumors harboring FGFR2 and FGFR3 fusions appear to be more robust than in tumors with FGFR gene 
amplifications based on early clinical data.  
1.[ADDRESS_423533] also 
described FGFR gene point mutations and translocations across a diverse array 
of cancer types. Currently , there are preclinical data that tumors with FGFR2 and 
FGFR3 point mutations and FGFR3/TACC3 fusions are responsive to AZD4547; Responses in tumo rs harboring FGFR2 and FGFR3 fusions appear to be more 
robust than in tumors with FGFR gene amplifications based on early clinical data. 
Based on the TCGA dataset , the prevalence of FGFR point mutations is above 
10% in bladder cancer, uterine cancer, cholangiocarcinom a and melanoma and 
5-10% in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, gastric and 
pancreas cancer. Although t he prevalence of FGFR fusions continues to be 
defined,  fusions have been described in lung, head and neck and bladder cancer 
as well as GBM and cholangiocarcinoma. Moreover, clinical activity of FGFR 
inhibitors has been reported in patients  whose cancers contain FGFR  fusions.

Drug Ordering: NCI supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_342025]  (or their authorized designee) at each participating institution.  
Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that drug be shipped directly 
to the institution where the patient is to be treated. PMB does not permit the transfer of 
agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained – see general 
information)  The CTEP -assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-
supplied investigational agents.  The eligible participating investigators at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), NCI Biosketch, Agent 
Shipment Form, and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investi gators at one institution, CTEP- supplied investigational agents for the study 
should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_170739].  
Submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application ( https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/OAOP
). Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account (

5.1.4  Storage and Stability  
Store 20 to 25° C (68 to 77° F) in the original container until use.  
Shelf -life studies are ongoing. Dispense tablets in the original, 
unopened containers. Do not repackage tablets in pharmacy bottles per the manufacturer’s instructions.  
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return AZD4547 to controlled room temperature and quarantine the supplies.  
Provide a detailed report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion) to 
[EMAIL_087]
 for determination of suitability.  
5.1.5  Dose Specifics  
AZD4547 is administered at 80 mg PO BID continuously on a 28- day 
cycle. Dose reductions to 60 mg PO BID continuously on a 28- day 
cycle are allowed.  
5.1.6  Preparation  
[COMPANY_008] supplies and CTEP, DCTD, NCI distributes AZD4547 as beige, round, biconvex, film -coated tablets in 20 mg and 80 mg 
strengths. Tablets are packed in high- density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles. Each 20- count bottle is secured with an induction sealed 
membra ne and child- resistant closure.  
Each tablet contains active drug substance and the following excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, magnesium 
carbonate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium starch glycolate and glyceryl dibehenate. The film coating contains polyvinyl alcohol, 
titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol 3350, talc, iron oxide yellow, iron 
oxide red and iron oxide black.

5.1.8  Incompatibilities  
In vitro  studies demonstrate that AZD4547 is mainly metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097] 3A4/5, 2D6 and 1A1 enzymes. Use caution in patients who are 
taking potent inhibitors or inducers of 3A4/5, 2D6 and 1A1. Smokers

Cancer Research Group  Version Date: May 16, 2018  
26 may experience reduced drug exposure since tobacco induces 
CYP1A1 activity. AZD4547 is also mainly glucuronidated by [CONTACT_15924]1A8 
and 9 isoforms; however, studies indicate a number of other CYP and 
UGT isoforms may be responsible for AZD4547 metabolism. 
In vitro  studies demonstrate that AZD4547 is a substrate of 
OATP1B1, does not inhibit p- glycoprotein (P -gp) and is a weak 
inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OCT2.  
In vivo , AZD4547 is a reversible and time -dependent inhibitor of CYP 
3A4/5. Use caution when combining AZD4547 with CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_423560] a narrow therapeutic window.

Patient Drug Information Handout and Wallet Card 
Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non- Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug, AZD4547.   This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_6808].  This form is addressed to the patient, but includes important informati on for others 
who care for this patient.   
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know:  
AZD4547 interacts with certain enzymes in the liver and certain transport proteins that help 
move drugs in and out of cells.  
• The enzymes in question are CYP 3A4/5, 2D6, 1A1, and UGT1A8/9. AZD4547 is broken 
down by [CONTACT_342027]. AZD4547 inhibits CYP 3A4/[ADDRESS_423566] other drugs that are broken 
down by [CONTACT_36918] . 
• The transport proteins in question are OATP1B1 and OCT2. AZD4547 requires OATP1B1 to move and out of cells. AZD4547 is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OCT2 transport proteins 
and may affect transport of other drugs that require these proteins to move in and out of 
cells.  
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached information card in your wallet . 
AZD4547 may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For this reason, it is very 
important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto this 
clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular medicines, or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk 
about your current medications with your doctors, include medicine you buy without a 
prescription (over -the-counter remedy), or any herbal supplements such as  St. John’s Wort.  It is 
helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  
Many health care providers can write prescriptions.  You must tell all of your health care providers (doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in 
a clinical trial. 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
AZD4547 must be used very carefully with other medicines that use certain liver enzymes and 
transport proteins to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  Before you enroll onto the 
clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular health care providers to review any 
medicines and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors of CYP 
3A4/5, 2D6, 1A1, UGT1A8/9 or OATP1B1 or substrates of CYP 3A4/5 and transport proteins 
OATP1B1 and OCT2.”  These characteristics may change how AZD4547 or other medicine 
works in your body.

• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may contain 
ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or pharm acist to 
determine if there could be any side effects.  
• Avoid ingesting grapefruit juice, grapefruit and Seville oranges while taking AZD4547.  
• Avoid smoking or use of tobacco products as they may affect how AZD4547 works in your 
body.  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine.

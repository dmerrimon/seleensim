Introduction
The data anal yses outlined in this document are to support clinical study  3110 -108-002. 
In this study, measurements w ill be made for ubrogepant and CGRP concentrations in 
plasma . This data anal ysis plan (DAP) outlines how data 
analyses of these measurements will be conducted. Additional analy sis may be 
conducted, if necessary .Safety  anal yses are described separatel y in the Statistical 
Analy sis Plan.
Objectives
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the effect of single dose erenumab or 
galcanezumab on the PK of ubrogepant in participants with migraine. The secondar y 
objective s of the stud y are to evaluate secondary  pharmacokinetic (PK)  parameters of 
ubrogepant following administration of ubrogepant and erenumab ,or ubrogepant and 
galcanezumab, and when ubrogepant is administered alone as well as t he safety  and 
tolerability  profiles when ubrogepant and erenumab or ubrogepant and galcanezumab are 
administered in combination and when administered alone in participants with a history 
of [ADDRESS_962999] 1 year and are aged 18 through 50 y ears. In Part 1, 20 participants will receive a 
single oral dose of 100 mg ubrogepant alone (Study Intervention A) on Day 1, a single 
SC injection of 140 mg erenumab alone (Study  Intervention B) on Day  8, followed by  
[CONTACT_138659] y oral doses of 100 mg ubrogepant on Days 12 through 15 (Study I ntervention 
D) under fasted conditions. Similarly , in Part 2, a separate cohort of 20 participants will 
receive a single oral dose of 100 mg ubrogepant alone (Study  intervention A) on Day  1, 2 
consecutive SC injections of 120 mg galcanezumab alone (Study  intervention C) o n Day  
8, followed by [CONTACT_708463] 100 mg ubrogepant on Days 12 through 15 (Stud y 
Intervention D) under fasted conditions.

GRD -SSP-T- 01-[ADDRESS_963000] of participants as defined below:
The safet y population includes all participants who receive/take ≥ 1 administration of 
study  intervention 
The PK 1population includes all participants who have evaluable plasma PK parameters 
of ubrogepant for both ubrogepant alone and ubrog epant in combination with erenumab 
or galcanezumab
 
 
The PK3 population includes all participants who have at least 1 CGRP concentration 
measurement in plasma
5.3 Sample Size Considerations
This is a study  to evaluate the safety , tolerability  and PK of ubrogepant when co -
administered with CGRP  MABs. Although the sample size is not based on a statistical 
calculation, i nclusion of 40 participants (20 participants in each part  
 is considered reasonable to achieve the objectives of the 
study .
5.4 Software
Pharmacokinetic anal ysis, summarization of concentration- time data and PK parameter 
values, and statistical analy sis of PK parameter values will be performed using Phoeni x®
WinNonlin ®(Version 
8.0or newer). Tabulations will be exported into Word 2016 (or 
newer) for formatting. Plotting of concentration- time profiles and scatter graphs (if 
applicable) will be performed using Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 8.0 or newer) , Excel 2016 
(or newer) or SigmaPlot 1 4(or newer).
5.[ADDRESS_963001] each participant’ s blood via an indwelling catheter or 
venipuncture from either arm into prechilled 4-mL vacutainer tubes containing K2EDTA as 
an anticoagulant. In Part A and Part B, PK blood samples to determine ubrogepant plasma 
concentrations will be collected at 0 hour (predose) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 

GRD -SSP-T- 01-01 NTS Data Analysis Plan Template v 2.0 1014, and 24 hours postdose on Day s 1 and 12. These samples will also be used for the 
determination of CGRP  concentrations.
A total of 52 venous bl ood samples (26 in Part A and 26 in Part B) per participant will be 
collected for PK and biomarker analysis. Within [ADDRESS_963002] be centrifuged at no less than 2500 gfor 10 minutes at approximately  
4°C. Aft er centrifugation, the plasma samples will be harvested and transferred into 2
prechilled, coded poly propy lene tube(s). The samples will then be flash- frozen in a dry  ice 
and alcohol bath (with isopropy l alcohol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, or methanol) and 
stored at approximately  –20°C or colder. 
Total blood volume collected per participant for PK samples is 104 mL (26 blood samples, 4
mL each) in Part A and Part B, respectively . 
Plasma concentrations of ubrogepant will be determined using a validated liquid 
chromatograph y-tandem mass spectrometry  method  
 
5.5.2 Biomark er Methodology
In Part A and Part B, PK blood samples to determine ubrogepant plasma concentrations will 
be collected at 0 hour (predose) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 24 hours 
postdose on Day s 1 and 12. These samples will also be used for the determination of 
biomarker (CGRP) concentrations.   
 
.Plasma and  of CGRP  will be determined using a qualified 
ELISA  assay .

GRD -SSP-T- 01-01 NTS Data Analysis Plan Template v 2.0 115.6 Data Handling and Storage
A source data file from will be transferred to Data Management via secure File 
Transfer Protocol (sFTP). Data Management will use the data for reconciliation against case 
report form (CRF) data and general cleaning.
Data Management shall provide the data file to Statistical Programming who will add th e
data to the  
software for the calculation of PKparameters. Once the  is 
created, Statistical Programming will notify  the Aller gan Clinical Pharmacology
representative via email and transfer it to the relevant group via a shared study -
specific 
repository , in the .
Pharmacokinetic anal ysis and statistical anal ysis of pharmacokinetic data will be performed 
using  or 
other appropriate software.
Unless otherwise specif ied in subsequent sections, these general data handling instructions 
will be followed:
All measured data will be used in anal ysis initially  unless it may  be excluded in 
accordance to regulatory  guidances. Measured data not used and the reasons for its 
exclusion from the final anal ysis will be documented in t he clinical study  report 
(CSR).
The actual sampling times will be used in the calculations of PK parameter values, 
nominal sample times will be used in the calculat ion of descriptive statistics.
All postdose time points for which no sample is collected will be treated as missing. 
No value will be imputed for these mi
ssing values.
Concentration data below the lower limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be defaulted to 
0.00.
A data file (‘.xpt’ or ‘.xls’ format) containing PKparameter values will be generated by  [CONTACT_708464] y-specific repository  for 
retrieval b y Statistical Programming and for archival. If necessary , a document defining the 
content and CDISC parameter names will also be provided. Other files necessary  to 
reproduce t he anal ysis of PK parameter values, e.g., the W inNonlin Project file, will be 
archived in PKS or another appropriate study -specific repository .

Data Analysis  
6.1 Pharmacok inetics
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for ubrogepant  determined from plasma 
concentration data for each part of the stud y will be calculated using noncompartmental 
analysis:
AUC0-t Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_963003] -
dose, calculated by [CONTACT_1690] -log trapezoidal rule
AUC0- Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity, as 
calculated by [CONTACT_708465] ( AUC 0-).AUC 0-∞values will be 
calculated and reported for all participants ,however values will only be 
included in the summary statistics and statistical analysis if the % 
extrapolated area (AUC%) is ≤ 20%.
AUC% Percent of AUC extrapolated from the last measurable concentration to 
infinity: [AUC% = (((AUC 0-∞-AUC0-t)/AUC 0-∞) *100)]
Cmax Maximal observed plasma concentration
CL/F Apparent oral clearance is the oral dose divided by [CONTACT_12265] 0-∞
λz Apparent terminal -phase rate constant, determined by [CONTACT_746] a 
regression analysis on the terminal linear phase of semi -logarithmic plots of 
individual concentration -time data using a minimum of three concentration -
time points in the elimination phase excluding C max. λzwill be considered to 
be valid if r2> 0.80. The values included in the regression analyses will be 
determined by [CONTACT_708466] w ill be revie wed and revised as necessary by 
[CONTACT_708467].
Tmax Time corresponding to maximal plasma concentration
T½ Apparent terminal -phase half -life,calculated as 0.693/ λz
Vz/F Apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after extravascular 
administration
If the extrapolated AUC is > 20%, the AUC 0-∞, CL/F, and V z/F values will be listed by  
[CONTACT_708468].
The PK parameter values will be reported up to at least [ADDRESS_963004] -SSP-T- 01-01 NTS Data Analysis Plan Template v 2.0 136.2 Biomark ers
The percent change from baseline in plasma CGRP levels will be calculated using Excel 
2016 (or newer) and will be presented b y study intervention and nominal timepoint for each 
part of the stud yfor the PK3 population.

Data Summarization and Statistical Analys is
7.1 Data  Summarization
PK1 Population
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, relative standard deviation, 
maximum, minimum) will be reported for the plasma concentrations of ubrogepant at each 
nominal time point for all participants in  the PK 1 Population by  [CONTACT_708469]. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, relative standard 
deviation, maximum, median, minimum) will be calculated for ubrogepant PK parameters for 
each stud y part by [CONTACT_34450] y intervention for all participants in the PK1 Population. Additionally , 
the geometric mean will be reported for ubrogepant C max, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-, CL/F, and Vz/F 
parameters.

GRD -SSP-T- 01-01 NTS Data Analysis Plan Template v 2.0 14PK3 Population
For each part of the study , individual values and descriptive statistics will be reported for the 
plasma CGRP  concentrations at each nominal time point for all participants in the PK3 
population. C hanges at postdose from baseline b y study  intervention will be reported for the 
plasma CGRP  concentrations at each nominal time point by [CONTACT_34450] y part for all participants in 
the PK3 population.
7.2 Statistical Analysis
Plasma PK parameters (C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞) for ubrogepant  will be compared using a 
linear mixed- effects model with study  intervention as fixed ef fect and participant as a random 
effect in each part of the study  for the PK1 population. Statistical anal ysis will be based on 
log-transformed values for the C max and AUC parameters  of ubrogepant . For each stud y part, 
the 2-sided 90% CI will be constructed for the ratio of least  squares geometric means  of C max, 
AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞ of ubrogepant in combination with CGRP  MAB (Test, Day 12) versus 
ubrogepant alone (Reference, Day  1). No ef fect of co -administration with CGRP  MABs on 
the PK of ubrogepant will be concluded if the 90% CI s for the ratios of ubrogepant PK  
parameters for test stud y intervention versus reference study  intervention are within the limits 
of 80% to 125%.

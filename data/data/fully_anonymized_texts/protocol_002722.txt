Title of Study: A Phase 3, Randomized, Open -Label , Active -Controlled Study of ALXN1210 Versus 
Eculizumab in Complement Inhibitor -Naïve Adult Patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)  
Protocol No:  ALXN1210 -PNH -[ADDRESS_70868] Number:  2016 -002025 -11 
Study Center(s): Approximately 300 investigative sites globally.  
Length of Study:  
Estimated date first patient treated:  Dec [ADDRESS_70869] patient completed:   Jan 2023  Phase of Development: 3 
 
Objective:   
The primary objective of this study is to assess the noninferiority of ALXN1210 compared to eculizumab in 
adult patients with PNH who have never been treated with a complement inhibit or.  
 
Noninferiority will be claimed if after 26 weeks of treatment: 1) the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the difference (ALXN1210 -eculizumab) in transfusion avoidance ( TA) rate is greater than -20%, and 2) 
the lower bound of the 95% CI for  the odds ratio of ALXN1210 compared to eculizumab for lactate 
dehydrogenase normalization (LDH -N) is greater than 0.39. 
Study Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 3, open -label , randomized, active -controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALXN1210 versus eculizumab administered by [CONTACT_33980] ( IV) 
infusion to adult patients with PNH who are naïve to complement inhibitor treatment. In addition, patients  may 
be rolled  over from other ongoing studies of ALXN1210  IV in patients with  PNH into the Extension Period of 
Study  ALXN1210- PNH -301 to receive ALXN1210 (hereafter referred to as Roll -over Cohort). Patients are 
allowed to  roll over into Study ALXN1210 -PNH -301 to receive continued ALXN1210 IV q8w maintenance 
treatment . 
 
For patient s enrolled directly into Study  ALXN1210 -PNH- 301, the study consists of a 4- week screening period , 
a 26-week randomized treatment period , and a n extension period  of up to 5 years . Patients will be stratified into 
1 of 6 groups based on their transfusion history ( 0, 1 to 14, or > 14 units  of packed red blood cells [ pRBCs ] in 
the [ADDRESS_70870] dose of study drug ) and screening lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (1.5 to  
< 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN] or ≥ 3 × ULN ). The p atients within each of the 6 groups will then be 
randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_70871] year will be capped at 2 0%.  
 Prior to randomization and within 5 days prior to study drug administration on Day 1, each patient’s 
hemoglobin must be evaluated by [CONTACT_65087]. If at that time the patient’s hemoglob in 
value meets protocol -specified transfusion guidelines, the patient must be transfused with pRBCs to a 
hemoglobin level above the protocol -specified transfusion threshold in order to be eligible for  randomization. 
The patient’s post -transfusion hemoglobin value should  be confirmed by [CONTACT_65088] -specified transfusion threshold.  
 
Patients randomly assigned to the ALXN1210 group will receive a loading dose of AL XN1210 (2400  mg for 
patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 60 kg , 2700  mg for patients weighing  ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, 3000 mg for patients 
weighing ≥ 100 kg ) on Day 1, followed by [CONTACT_65089]1210 (3000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 
40 to <  60 kg, 3300  mg for p atients weighing ≥ 60 to <  100 kg, 3600  mg for patients weighing ≥ 100 kg) on 
Day 15 and every 8 weeks (q8w)  thereafter for a total of 26  weeks of treatment. Patients randomly assigned to 
the eculizumab group will receive induction treatment with 600 mg of  eculizumab IV on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, 
followed by [CONTACT_65090] 900 mg on Day  29 and every 2 weeks (q2w) thereafter for 
a total of [ADDRESS_70872] is registered or approved (in accordance with 
country- specific regulations) or for up to [ADDRESS_70873]. (In Norway  and Denmark , patients will 
participat e for a total of  2.5 years.) Beginning on Day 183, patients who had been randomized to the 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -301   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment 6 , 12 April 2021 
Page 7 of 93 
Alexion Confidential  ALXN1210 treatment group  will receive a maintenance dose (as described above) of ALXN1210 q8w, and 
patients who had been randomized to the eculizumab group  will receive a l oading dose (as described above) of 
ALXN1210 followed 2 weeks  later and q8w thereafter  by a weight- based maintenance dose of ALXN1210 . 
 
For the Roll -over Cohort, patients will receive ALXN1210 weight- based q8w maintenance dosing . 
 
 
Abbreviations: IV = intravenous; PNH  = paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; R = roll -over  
 
A pRBC transfusion will be administered when a patient has a hemoglobin value of 9 g/dL or lower with signs 
or symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant a transfusion , or a hemoglobin value of 7 g/dL or lower  regardless 
of presence of clinical signs or symptoms . 
Number of Patients (planned)  in the original Study  ALXN1210 -PNH -301 Cohort : Based on the co primary 
endpoint of TA, approximately 214 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ALXN1210 (N = 
107) or eculizumab (N = 10 7) to ensure at least 193 evaluable patients (assum es no more than 10% drop- out 
rate).  
A maximum number of approximately 56  patients may roll over from ot her ongoing studies of ALXN1210  IV 
in patients with PNH into the Extension Period of Study  ALXN1210 -PNH -301. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusion:

Statistical methods:  
Original Study  ALXN1210-PNH- 301 Cohort: 
General : A clinical study report (CSR) will be produced based on efficacy, safety, PK, and PD data collected 
through  the end of the 26- week randomized treatment period  (Day 183) . A final CSR to summarize long -term 
efficacy, safety , PK, and PD  parameters will be p roduced at study completion.  
 
Efficacy : Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) . The coprimary efficacy endpoint 
analyses , as well as key secondary endpoint analyses will also be performed on the Per Protocol (PP) set.  The

Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The co primary efficacy endpoints are 1) the difference between treatment groups  in the proportion of patients 
who achieve  TA through Day 183, and 2) the relative effect of treatment in LDH -N from Day 29 through Day 
183 expressed as an odds ratio .  
 
The percentage of patients who achieve TA with 95% CI s will be computed at Day 183 for both the ALXN1210 
and eculizumab treatment groups and the randomization s trata. A difference in the percentage of patients 
achieving TA in the 2 treatment groups will be calculated between ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups, along with a 95% CI for the difference. The difference between ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment 
groups will be computed as a weighted combination of the differences between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab 
treatment groups within stratification groups  (using Mantel -Haenszel) . The 95% CI for the difference between 
ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups will be calculated using the stratified Newcombe confidence interval method.   
 LDH- N will be analyzed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach which accounts for the 
repeated measures of LDH -N at each visit. The GEE approach provides odds ratios and CIs of treatment effect 
while controlling for the correlation between visits for a given patient and other baseline factors. LDH -N from 
Day 29 through Day 183 will be u sed as the dependent variable and an indicator variable for treatment, history 
of transfusion (as a categorical variable based on the stratification factor levels ), and baseline LDH level (as a 
continuous variable) will  be included in the m odel as explanat ory variables. The within -patient correlation will 
assume a first -order autoregressive structure which assumes the highest correlation is between visits that are 
closest in time. Day [ADDRESS_70880] scheduled assessment after initiation of maintenance dosi ng, and  experience 
with eculizumab and Phase 1b/2 ALXN1210 data demonstrate  near maximal suppression of  LDH  by 4 weeks  of 
treatment . Results from the model will be presented as odds ratios with 95% CIs.   
 
In order to  conclude ALXN1210 is noninferior to eculizumab, both coprimary endpoints individually need to 
demonstrate noninferiority. If the lower -bound of the 95% CI for the difference (ALXN1210 -eculizumab) is 
greater than the noninferiority margin (NIM) of -20% for TA and the lower bound of the 95% CI for the odds 
ratio of ALXN1210 compared to eculizumab  is greater  than the  NIM of 0.39 for LDH -N, then ALXN1210 
treatment will be concluded to be noninferior to eculizumab.  
 Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The 4 key se condary efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_65095] 26 -week randomized treatment 
period. Change in FACIT -Fatigue  (and percent change in LDH ) from baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed 
using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, the stratification randomization indicator s of transfusion history ( 0, 1 to 14, or > [ADDRESS_70881] dose of study drug) and screening LDH levels (1.5 to <  3 × ULN  or ≥ 3 × ULN ), study visit and 
study visit by [CONTACT_65096], fixed covariates of baseline FACIT -Fatigue 
(or LDH ) and baseline FACIT -Fatigue ( or LDH)- by-visit interaction as covariates.  For percent change in LDH, 
the baseline LDH level as a continuous variable  will be included.  The Kenward -Roger approximation will be 
used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. A difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups along with a 2 -sided 95% CI will be calculated.  
 
For breakthrough hemolysis and stabilized hemoglobin , the same approach used for TA will be employed . 
These key secondary efficacy endpoints w ill be tested in a hierarchical manner provided that noninferiority was 
declared for the coprimary  endpoints.  
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -[ADDRESS_70882] 
precludes assessment of subsequent tests.  
1. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab 
treatment groups in the percentage change from Baseline to Week 26 in LDH is less than the NIM 
of 20%, then ALXN1210 w ill be declared noninferior  for this parameter and the next parameter 
will be tested.  
2. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab 
treatment groups in change from baseline in FACIT -Fatigue is greater than the NIM  of -5, then 
ALXN1210 will be declared noninferior  for this parameter and the next parameter will be tested.  
3. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab 
treatment groups in the proportion of patients with breakth rough hemolysis is less than the NIM of 
20%, then ALXN1210 will be declared noninferior  for this parameter and the next parameter will 
be tested . 
4. If the lower  bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab 
treatment groups in th e proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin is greater than the NIM 
of -20%, then ALXN1210 will be declared noninferior  for this parameter.  
 
If noninferiority is established for all key secondary endpoints then superiority will be assessed using a closed -testing procedure with the following order and using a [ADDRESS_70883] for each parameter:  
 
5. Proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis through Day 183 (Week 26)  
6. Percentage change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in LDH  
7. Hemolysis as directly measured by [CONTACT_26265] -N from Day 29 through Day183 (Week 26)  
8. Change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in FACIT -Fatigue  
9. Proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin through Day 183 (Week 26)  
10. Transfusion avoidance  
 
Due to the hierarchical testing order being prespecified, no adjustment  for type I error is required . 
 
Other Secondary Endpoints  
Changes from baseline in EORTC -QLQ -C30 will be summarized by [CONTACT_65097]. Shifts fr om baseline in clinical manifestations of PNH will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_65098]. The number of 
any treatment -emergent MAVEs (n) and number of patients with events (n, %) will be displayed by  [CONTACT_6490].  Total number of units of pRBCs transfused during treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . 
Kaplan -Meier curves for both treatment groups and estimates of time to first occurrence of LDH -N since first 
study drug will be produced.  No statistical inference of these parameters is planned.  
  
Safety : All s afety analyses will be conducted for  the Safety set , defined as all patients who receive at least 1 
dose of ALXN1210 or eculizumab. Safety results will be reported by [CONTACT_1570]. The incidence of 
treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_65099], by 
[CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_65100]. The incidence of serious adverse events will also b e summarized. Changes from baseline (last assessment prior to ALXN1210 or eculizumab) in 
ECGs, vital signs , and laboratory assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Shifts from baseline in 
laboratory assessments will be summarized for all study visits by [CONTACT_1570].  
  
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics : PK and PD samples will be collected over the course of the study . 
Individual serum concentration data for all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (ie, ALXN1210 or 
eculizumab) and who have evaluable PK data will be used to derive PK parameters for ALXN1210 and 
eculizumab.  Graphs of mean serum concentration- time profiles will be constructed . Graphs of serum 
concentration -time profiles for individual patients may also be generated. Actual dose administration and 
sampling times will be used for all calculations. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for serum concentration 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -[ADDRESS_70884] evaluable PK and PD data. Descriptive statistics will be presented for all ALXN1 210 and 
eculizumab PD endpoints at each sampling time. The PD effects of ALXN1210 and eculizumab administered IV will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65101] C5 serum concentrations a nd cRBC hemolysis over time, as appropriate . Assessments of ALXN1210 
PK/PD relationships may be explored using data from this study or in combination with data from other studies.  
 
Analysis of Roll- over Cohort :  
Analysis of data from patients who are rolled over from other ongoing ALXN1210 PNH studies will be performed as a separate cohort. The analysis will focus on the long- term safety after their roll over. The 
long-term safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65102] -emergent adverse events and SAEs , laboratory 
assessments, and proportion of patients who develop ADAs.  
The analyses will be performed on the Roll -over Safety Set defined as all patients who receive at least

Alexion Confidential  5. INTRODUCTION  
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hemolytic disorder that occurs most 
frequently in adults ( Brodsky, 2015). The disease begins with the clonal expansion of a 
hematopoietic stem cell that has acquired a somatic mutation in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_65072] ( Brodsky, 2014). 
Consequently, PNH blood cells lack the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor protein and are 
deficient in the membrane -bound complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59. In the 
absence of CD55, there is increased deposition of complement protein C3 cleavage products on 
blood cell membrane surfaces, in turn leading to cleavage of component 5 ( C5) into C5a and 
C5b. The pathology and clinical presentations in patients with PNH are driven by [CONTACT_65104] (RBCs). 
C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin, chemotactic factor, and cell- activating molecule that mediates 
multiple pro -inflammatory and pro -thrombotic activities (Matis , 1995;  Prodinger, 1999). C5b 
recruits the terminal complement components C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form the pro- inflammatory, 
pro-thrombotic cytolytic pore molecule C5b -9, a process that under nor mal circumstances would 
be blocked on the RBC membrane by [CONTACT_398]59. In patients with PNH, however, these final steps proceed unchecked, culminating in hemolysis and the release of free hemoglobin, as well as platelet activation  (Hill, 2013). The signs and symptoms of PNH can be attributed to chronic, 
uncontrolled complement C5 cleavage and release of C5a and C5b -9 leading to RBC hemolysis, 
which results in the release of intracellular free hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into circulation; irreversible binding to and inactivation of nitric oxide (NO) by [CONTACT_33308], and 
inhibition of NO synthesis; vasoconstriction and tissue- bed ischemia due to absence of 
vasodilatory NO as well as possible microthrombi manifesting as abdomin al pain, dysphagia, 
and erectile dysfunction; platelet activation; and a pro- inflammatory and prothrombotic state 
(Hill, 2013 ; Brodsky, 2014). A substantial proportion of patients with PNH experience renal 
dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension ( Hillmen , 2010;  Hill, 2012b;  Hill, 2013). Patients also 
experience venous or arterial thrombosis in diverse sites, including the abdomen or central nervous system ( Brodsky, 2014).  
Eculizumab  (Soliris
®) is a humanized monoclonal antibody approved for treating PNH. 
Eculizumab  specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity. Eculizumab has 
no known off- target interactions with other proteins in vitro or in vivo. In addition, eculizumab is 
predicted to be effectorless, having no detectable binding to complement C1q or most Fcγ 
receptors (FcγR I, IIb/c IIIa, IIIb) and more  than 10-fold weaker binding than an IgG1 isotype to 
FcγR IIa. These attributes underlie the established safety and therapeutic efficacy profile of eculizumab demonstrated in the 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 clinical studies and supported by [CONTACT_65105].  
ALXN1210 was engineered from eculizumab to preserve immediate and complete C5 inhibition 
while providing sustained complement inhibition throughout a prolonged dosing interval (1 month or longer) . ALXN1210 and eculizumab share > 99% amino -acid sequence homology. 
ALXN1210 is a recombinant, humanized protein produced in Chinese hamster cells and was 
designed through minimal targeted engineering to substitute 4 amino acids in the eculizumab heavy chain. Two of these substitutions are in the complementarity determining regions, 
lowering the affinity of ALXN1210 for C5; the other two are in the Fc binding region which 
improves recycling of ALXN1210 into the vascular space instead of degrading. These changes were specifically designed (and have subsequently been proven) to increase the half -life of 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -301   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Amendment 6 , 12 April 2021 
Page 23 of 93 
Alexion Confidential  ALXN1210 relative to eculizumab, increasing the duration of terminal complement inhibition, 
while preserving both the high degree of specificity for binding to C5 and the effectorless nature 
of the antibody. 
The main objective of effective PNH treatment with targeted therapy is to provide immediate, 
complete, and sustained inhibition of terminal complement activity  to block hemolysis and 
prevent throm bosis . More specifically, incomplete C5 blockade may increase risk of potentially 
life-threatening breakthrough hemolysis ( Hill, 2012a ; Lee , 2013). Any loss of efficacy at the end 
of a dos ing interval or missed doses due to inconvenience of dosing intervals may put patients at 
substantial medical risk. Patients treated with eculizumab are required to receiv e maintenance 
infusions every [ADDRESS_70892] the same rapid onset of action and effective blockade of complement, with an increased serum half-life to yield an increased duration of pharmacologic 
activity relative to eculizumab.  The substantially longer half-life of ALXN1210 is expected to 
produce sustained terminal complement inhibition during a longer dosing interval  and thus  
reduce the potential risk of breakthrough complement -mediated hemolysis during the treatment 
period, thus improving the overall health of patients. 
Two studies of ALXN1210 are ongoing in patients with PNH who are naïve to treatm ent with 
complement inhibitors. Study ALXN1210- PNH -103 is a Phase 1b, open- label , multiple -dose 
study, and Study ALXN1210- PNH-201 is a Phase 2, open- label, multiple -dose, proof-of- concept 
study. ALXN1210 -PNH -103 is designed to assess dose ranging over a 2-fold range of trough 
exposure levels, while Study ALXN1210- PNH-201 is designed to assess dose intervals of 4, 6, 8, 
and 12 weeks. Each study in patients with PNH also includes a 2-year extension phase. In 
addition, Study ALXN1210- HV-104 is being conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile of ALXN1210 in healthy Japanese subjects. 
In this Phase 3, open- label , randomized  study, the efficacy and safety of ALXN1210 will be 
assessed  compared to eculizumab in patients with PNH who are naïve to treatment with 
complement inhibitor , including eculizumab. In addition, long -term safety of patients who rolled  
over from other ongoing studies of ALXN1210 intravenous ( IV) in patients with PNH into the 
Extension Period of Study ALXN1210 -PNH-301 will be evaluated. The study design rationale is 
further discussed in Section  7.2.  
More information about the PK, mechanism of action,  known and expected benefits, risks, and 
reasonably anticipated adverse events (AEs) of ALXN 1210 may be found in the current edition 
of the I nvestigator ’s Brochure (IB). 
5.1. Benefits and Risks Assessment  
5.1.1. Potential Benefits  
PNH is an ultra -rare, progressive, debilitating, and life -threatening disease, driven by [CONTACT_65106]. The resulting inflammation and cellular damage lead to 
systemic complications, principally through intravascular hemolysis and thrombophilia  
(Brodsky, 2014; Socie , 1996). Chronic intravascular hemolysis due to continuous activation of 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -[ADDRESS_70893] of care for the treatment of PNH is eculizumab (Soliris
®), a recombinant humanized mAb that binds to the human C5 complement protein and 
inhibits the activation of terminal complement. The efficacy and safety of eculizumab for the treatment of PNH are well established.  The approved dosage regimen for eculizumab for PNH 
involves [ADDRESS_70894] the same rapid onset of action and effective blockade of complement, with an increased 
serum half -life to yield an increased duration of pharmacologic activity relative to eculizumab. 
By [CONTACT_65107], ALXN1210 will 
allow greater access to care for those patients who may not initiate treatment or may discontinue 
eculizumab due to frequency of dosing, or patients who are currently on therapy receiving eculizumab every 2 weeks. Additionally, the substantially longer half-life of ALXN1210 is 
expected to produce sustained terminal complement inhibition during a longer dosing interval. In 
PNH this may reduce the potential risk of breakthrough, complement- mediated hemolysis, as 
suggested by [CONTACT_65108], which demonstrate rapid 
and sustained reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a direct measure of hemolytic 
activity that is of comparable mag nitude to that seen in studies of eculizumab. 
5.1.2. Identified and Potential R isks 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infections (N. Meningitidis and O ther E ncapsulated O rganisms)  
Increased susceptibility to infection, especially with encapsulated bacteria, is a known risk 
associated with complem ent inhibition. Similar to eculizumab, the main risk associated with 
ALXN1210 is the risk of meningococcal infections. Specific risk mitigation measures are in 
place to address this risk, as described in  Section  9.8. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
As a humanized mAb, administration of ALXN1210 may be associated with immunogenicity reactions similarly to any therapeutic protein. Monitoring of immunogenicity is in place for this study, as described in Section  7.[ADDRESS_70895] been 
observed to date in clinical studies with ALXN1210.

6.2.5. Safety Endpoints  
For the original Study ALXN1210 -PNH-301 Cohort, t he safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 
compared with eculizumab will be evaluated by [CONTACT_31029], vital signs, 
electrocardiogra ms (ECGs ), laboratory assessments, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs).  The proportion of patients who develop antidrug antibodies 
(ADAs ) will also be assessed.  
The long- term safety of patients on ALXN1210 after their roll over into the Extension Period of 
Study ALXN1210- PNH -301 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65094], laboratory 
assessments, and the proportion of patients who develop ADA.

Alexion Confidential  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Summary of Study Design 
Study ALXN1210- PNH -301 is a Phase 3, open- label , randomized, active -controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALXN1210 versus eculizumab administered by 
[CONTACT_33980] ( IV) infusion to adult patients with PNH who are naïve to complement inhibitor 
treatme nt. The study will enroll approximately 21 4 patients  (107 patients per treatment group). 
In addition, patients may be rolled over from other ongoing studies of ALXN1210 IV in patients with PNH into the Extension Period of Study ALXN1210 -PNH -301 to receive ALXN1210 
(hereafter referred to as Roll-over Cohort). 
For patients enrolled directly into Study ALXN1210 -PNH-301, the study consists of a 4- week 
screening period, a 26- week randomized treatment period, and an extension period of up to 5 
years. Patients will be stratified into 1 of 6 groups based on their transfusion history (0, 1 to 14, 
or > [ADDRESS_70896] dose of study drug) and screening LDH levels (1.5 to < 3 × ULN  or ≥  3 × ULN). The patients within each of the 6 groups will then be 
randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_70897] year will be capped at 20%. 
Prior to randomization and within 5 days prior to study drug administration on Day 1, each 
patient’s hemoglobin must be evaluated by [CONTACT_65087]. If at that time the 
patient’s hemoglobin value meets protocol -specified transfusion guidelines, the patient must be 
transfused with pRBCs to a hemoglobin level above the protocol-specified transfusion threshold 
in order to be eligible for  randomization. The patient’s post-transfusion hemoglobin value should 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_65110]- specified transfusion 
threshold . 
Patients randomly assigned to the ALXN1210 group will receive a loading dose of ALXN1210 
(2400 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 to < 60 kg, 2700 mg for patients weighing  ≥ 60 to < 100 kg, 
3000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 100 kg) on Day 1, followed by [CONTACT_65111]1210 (3000 mg for patients weighing ≥ 40 to <  60 kg, 3300 mg for patients weighing ≥ 60 
to < 100 kg, 3600 mg for patients weighing ≥  100 kg) on Day 15 and every 8 weeks (q 8w) 
thereafter for a total of 26  weeks of treatment. Patients randomly assigned to the eculizumab 
group will recei ve induction treatment with 600 mg of eculizumab IV on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, 
followed by [CONTACT_65090] 900 mg on Day 29 and every 2 weeks (q2w) thereafter for a total of [ADDRESS_70898] is 
registered or approved (in accordance with country-specific regulations) or for up to [ADDRESS_70899] . (In Norway  and Denmark, patients will participate for  a total of 
2.5 years.) Beginning on Day 183, patients who had been randomized to the ALXN1210 treatment group will receive a maintenance dose (as described above) of ALXN1210 q8w, and 
patients who had been randomized to the eculizumab group will receive a loading dose (as 
described above) of ALXN1210 followed [ADDRESS_70900] is registered or approved (in accordance

A pRBC transfusion will be administered when a patient has a hemoglobin value of 9 g/dL or 
lower with signs or symptoms of sufficient severity to warrant a transfusion , or a hemoglobin 
value of 7 g/dL or lower regardless of presence of clinical signs or symptoms. 
7.2. Discussion of Design and Control  
Published d ata support LDH as a reliable, objective, and direct measure of intravascular 
hemolysis in patients with PNH  and is considered by [CONTACT_65112]- mediated hemolysis, the hallmark of PNH disease activity  (Dale , 1972;  
Parker , 2005 ; Canalejo , 201 3). Results from the eculizumab clinical program showed that LDH 
concentrations remained markedly elevated and unchanged in untreated (placebo) patients, while 
eculizumab -treated patients had an immediate reduction in serum LDH to normal or near normal 
levels (Soliris® USPI [INVESTIGATOR_65073] ). This reduction mirrored a  rapid reduction in symptoms and 
improvement in fatigue ( Hillmen , 200 6; Brodsky, 2008 ).

Amendment 6 , 12 April 2021 
Page 31 of 93 
Alexion Confidential  Transfusion avoidance  is chosen as the coprimary endpoint because it is informative regardless 
of the patient’s transfusion history. The incidence of t ransfusion s was a coprimary endpoint in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_65074]  (C04 -001) for eculizumab, and TA  was a key secondary endpoint. 
The safety parameters being evaluated are commonly used in clinical trials per International 
Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) and good clinical practice ( GCP ) guidances. 
Eculizumab was selected as the active control for ethical reasons.  Eculizumab is currently the 
standard of care for patients with PNH . 
Patients with PNH receiving ALXN1210 IV in other ongoing ALXN1210 studies are allowed to 
roll over into Study ALXN1210 -PNH -301 and receive continued ALXN1210 IV  q8w 
maintenance treatment.  
7.3. Schedule of Assessments 
The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Table 1 for the Screening and Randomized 
Treatment Period and in Table  2 and Table  3 (patients entering from ALXN1210 group) and 
Table  4 and Table  5 (patients entering from eculizumab group) for the Extension Period. The 
Schedule of Assessments for patients who rolled  over from ongoing ALXN1210 IV studies in  
patients with  PNH is provided in Table  6. 
Refer to the L aboratory Manual for details on the number of samples and volumes for all 
sampling and tests during the study. 
Additional (unscheduled) visits outside the specified visits are permitted at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Procedures, tests, and assessments will be performed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. A ny tests, procedures, or assessments performed at the Unscheduled Visits must be 
recorded on the electronic case report forms ( eCRFs ).  
Additionally, if a suspected event of breakthrough hemolysis occurs, LDH, PK, and PD parameters must be analyzed at the central laboratory. If the suspected event of breakthrough 
does not occur at a scheduled visit, an unscheduled visit should occur for evaluation of the patient and collection of the required LDH, PK, and PD parameters. For purposes of defining 
breakthrough hemolysis, assessment of LDH must be based on a central laboratory value.

8.3. Discontinuation  
8.3.1. Withdrawal of Patients  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. If a patient withdraws consent,  the 
assessments specified for the Early Termination  (ET)  visit (as shown in the Schedule of 
Assessments , Section 7.3 ) will be performed and the Sponsor and site monitor notified as soon as 
possible. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
Patients should be permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment if any of the following 
occur during the study: 
• Serious infusion reaction (such as bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring 
ventilator support or symptomatic hypotension, refer to Appendix A ) or serum 
sickness -like reactions manifesting 1 to 14 days after drug administration;  
• Severe uncontrolled infection;  
• Pregnancy or planned pregnancy; or 
• If the Alexion M edical Monitor or the Investigator deems it to  be in the best interest 
of the patient.  
The Investigator should speak with the Medical Monitor prior to discontinuing a patient’s study 
treatment. If a patient is discontinued from study drug, the patient should be encouraged to return 
for the remainder of his or her scheduled protocol visits until starting a different complement -
targeted therapy. 
The reason for the treatment or study discontinuation will be recorded on the eCRF . 
If a patient is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory result that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator,  is significantly outside of the reference

until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved . 
As it is essential to obtain follow -up data on any patient withdrawn due to an AE or SAE, 
follow -up due diligence documentation will consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered 
letter to the patient’s  last known address. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake 
protocol specified safety follow -up procedures.  
If a female patient is permanently discontinued from ALXN1210 treatment due to pregnancy, the 
Investigator will attempt to follow -up until the outcome of the pregnancy (see Section  11.8).  
8.3.2. Discontinuation of Study /Site  Termination by [CONTACT_65115]. Conditions that 
may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to:  
• Discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the 
study  
• Sponsor decision to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the 
study drug  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the approved protocol, pertinent guidelines, and/or regulations  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the Investigator to the  Sponsor 
and/or health  authorities  
Should the study be terminated early, the Sponsor will notify the health  authority and 
Institutional Review Board  (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) according to local 
requirements.  
8.4. End of Study Definition  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last patient’s last visit in the Extension Period.

9.1. Materials and Supplies  
9.1.1. Description  of Study Drugs  
The study drugs in this study are ALXN1210 and eculizumab  (active control) . Both ALXN1210 
and eculizumab are humanized, anti-C5 monoclonal antibod ies.  
Eculizumab is an IgG2/4 kappa immunoglobulin consisting of human constant regions, and 
murine complementarity -determining regions grafted onto human framework light- and heavy-
chain variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 
214 amino acid light chains.  
ALXN1210 is produced in Chinese hamster cells and was designed through minimal targeted 
engineering of eculizumab by [CONTACT_2359] 4 unique amino acid substitutions to its  heavy chain to 
extend antibody half- life. ALXN1210 and eculizumab share over 99% primary amino acid 
sequence identity and have very similar pharmacology. 
ALXN1210 and eculizumab drug products are  supplied for clinical studies as sterile, 
preservative -free 10- mg/mL solutions in single -use vial s and designed for infusion by [CONTACT_65116] (0.9% sodium chloride injection; country- specific 
pharmacopeia) for administration via IV infusion .

9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment 
Original Study  ALXN1210 -PNH-301 Cohort : Patients  who meet all criteria for enrollment will 
be random ly assigned  to study treatment with ALXN1210 or eculizumab at the Baseline V isit 
(Day 1). Treatment group a ssignment will be determined by a computer-generated random 
sequence using an interactive voice- or web -response system (I xRS) . The randomization will be 
a stratified randomization. Patients will be stratified into 1 of 6 groups based on their transfusion 
history ( 0, 1 to 14, or > [ADDRESS_70929] dose of study drug) and 
screening lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (1.5  to < 3 × ULN or ≥  3 × ULN). The patients 
within each of the 6 groups will then be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ALXN1210 
or eculizumab dur ing the 26-week randomized treatment period. 
All p atients in the Roll- over Cohort will receive ALXN1210.  
9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study  
The weight- based dosages of ALXN1210 in this study ( Table 10) are  premised  on PK/PD data 
from early development studies in healthy adult volunteers as well as the available data from 
patients with PNH in an ongoing Phase 1b dose-finding study (ALXN1210- PNH-103) and an 
ongoing Phase 2 proof- of-concept study (ALXN1210- PNH-201). The selection of ALXN1210 
dose regimen is based on targeting immediate, complete and sustained inhibition of terminal complement in patients with PNH.

guidance on identifying and managing potential drug i nfusion reactions.  
9.6. Blinding  
This is an open -label study. 
9.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonp harmaco logic 
Procedures  
For the Original Study  ALXN1210- PNH-301 Cohort, prior medications (including vitamins and 
herbal preparations)— including those discussed in the exclusion criteria (Section  8.1.2) and 
procedures (any therapeutic intervention, such as surgery/biopsy or physical therapy) the pa tient 
takes or undergoes within [ADDRESS_70930] dose of study 
drug—will be recorded on the patient’s eCRF.  In addition, history of meningococcal vaccination 
must be collected for the [ADDRESS_70931] study drug administration will be 
recorded on the patient’s eCRF. 
For both cohorts, a ll medication use  and procedures undertaken during the study will be recorded 
in the patient’s source  document/ medical chart and eCRF. This record will include all 
prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, over- the-counter medications, and 
current medications for PNH. Concomitant medications will be recorded from the first infusion 
of study drug  through 56 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Any changes in 
concomitant medications also will be recorded in the patient’s source document/ medical chart 
and eCRF. Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the patient’s standard of care 
during the study, or for the treatment of any AE, along with the allowed medications described 
below may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. However, i t is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that details regarding all medication s are recorded in full in the patient’s 
source document/ medical chart  and eCRF . 
Concomitant use of anticoagulants is prohibited if not on a sta ble dose regimen for  at least 
2 weeks prior to Day 1. 
Use of complement inhibitors other than the patient’s assigned study treatment is prohibited.  
9.8. Vaccination  
Due to their  mechanism of action, the use of eculizumab or ALXN1210 increases the patient’s 
susceptibility to mening ococcal infection ( N. meningitidis ). To reduce the risk of meningococcal 
infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within [ADDRESS_70932] be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination 
guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement inhibitors (eg, eculizumab). The vaccinations must be reconfirmed after [ADDRESS_70933] 
as described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  7.3). Vaccination status for N.  meningitidis  
will be recorded on the patient’ s eCRF.  
9.9. Treatment Compliance 
Patients will be administered study drug in a controlled setting under the supervision of the 
Investigator or designee, thereby [CONTACT_65120]. The 
Investigator or designee w ill ensure that all patients are adequately informed on the specific 
dosing regimen required for compliance with the study protocol, ensure that the patient receives the appropriate dose at t he designated time points during the study and that adequate safety 
monitoring occurs during the infusion ( Section  9.5). 
9.10. Home Visits During the Extension Period  
During the Extension Period, and only for visits not requiring a n abbreviated  physical exam, 
patients may have the opportunity to have ALXN1210 admin istered at a medical facility that is 
located near the patient’s home if allowed by [CONTACT_65121] n. This will also ensure patient 
safety and treatment continuity during the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic. 
Alternatively, ALXN1210 may be administered at the patient’s home under the orders of the 
Investigator and in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or regulations of the 
pertinent regulatory authorities. These visits will be conducted by a tra ined qualified staff 
member from the medical facility near the patient’s home or by [CONTACT_65122]. The study drug will be prepared at the Investigator’s pharmacy and transported 
under controlled conditions to the patient’s home or the medical facility for administration  by a 
dedicated courier. The use of a courier, specialized in medicinal product shipments, is needed to 
ensure traceability and temperature controlled delivery for the transfer of drug from 
Investigator’s pharmacy t o patient’s home or the medical facility for administration , as specified 
in the home health care manual . During a remote dosing visit, all assessments will be performed 
according to the schedule of assessments, including recording of AEs and concomitant medications, collection of blood and urine samples, assessment of PNH symptomatology, vital signs, QoL assessments, and review of safety card.  Patients must return to the study site for any 
visit at which  an abbreviated physical examination is required, as specified in the Schedule of

Alexion Confidential  Assessments (Section  7.3). Information about AEs  concomitant medications, and samples for 
protocol-defined laboratory parameters must be sent to the Investigator’s site for evaluation on 
the day of the remote visit.  In countries  where local legislation does not allow infusions outside 
authorized study sites, the Investigators will be notified in writing that this provision is 
prohibited. 
9.11. COVID- [ADDRESS_70934] that Study  ALXN1210- PNH -301 is open-label and every 
participant is treated with the study intervention also contribute s to the potential benefit a 
participant may derive from partaking in the study. Given that treatment for PNH does involve immunosuppression, there is a theoretical concern that the risk for infection may be higher than in participants not receiving immuno suppressants. However, there is no specific data to further 
inform this risk. The Investigator will therefore balance the risk/benefit considerations for the study participant, taking these factors into account.  
The potential risks identified and mitigation measures put in place in light of the COVID -19 
pandemic are provided in Table  12.

9.12. COVID- 19 Vaccine Risk Assessment  
Following a review of the available COVID -19 vaccine data (eg, [COMPANY_007]/BioNTech, Moderna, 
[COMPANY_008], [COMPANY_012]), it is unlikely that the immune response to a COVID-19 
vaccine (an d therefore the efficacy of the vaccination) would be diminished with concomitant 
ALXN1210  administration, based on ALXN1210 ’s mechanism of action. There is currently no 
information available evaluating the safety and efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines in participants 
treated with  ALXN1210. The same precautions should be taken as described in Section  9.8. 
Vaccination may further activate complement. As a result, patients with complement -mediated

Alexion Confidential  diseases may experience increased signs and symptoms of their underlying disease. Therefore, 
patie nts should be closely monitored for disease symptoms after recommended vaccination  
Because vaccines may activate complement, if possible, consider vaccination when the underlying complement mediated disease is clinically controlled and when systemic C5 inhibitor concentration (and subsequent complement blockade) is relatively high, shortly after 
administration.  
Local and national guidelines should be consulted for recommendations related to COVID-[ADDRESS_70938] in light of the

10.1. Transfusions 
A pRBC transfusion will be administered when a patient has a 
• hemoglobin value of 9 g/dL or lower with signs or symptoms  of sufficient severity to 
warrant a transfusion  
• hemoglobin value of 7 g/dL or lower regardless of presence of clinical sign s or 
symptoms  
Signs or s ymptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_65078]’s need for transfusion 
will also be documented on the eCRF for each individual patient. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_65079] -related 
symptoms warranting transfusions include angina, change in mental status (eg, syncope, light 
headedness, confusion, stroke, t ransient ischemic attack ), severe or worsening shortness of 
breath, and severe or worsening fatigue. Other symptoms precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505] a potential need for 
transfusion should be discussed wi th the Medical Monitor before the transfusion is given. 
If a patient meets either  transfusion criterion during the study, the I nvestigator will determine the 
appropriate number of units of pRBCs to be transfused . It is recommended that the  transfusion be 
performed within [ADDRESS_70943] be consulted. 
For the original Study ALXN1210 -PNH-301 Cohort, prior to randomization and within 5 days 
prior to study drug administration on Day 1, each patient’s hemoglobin must be evaluated by [CONTACT_65087]. If at that time the patient’s hemoglobin value meets these 
transfusion guidelines, the patient must be transfused with pRBCs to a hemoglobin level above the transfusion threshold in order to be eligible for randomization. The patient’s post- transfusion 
hemoglobin value should be confirmed by [CONTACT_65124] . 
10.2. LDH and Other Disease -Related Laboratory Parameters  
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  7.3) and as indicated in Section  11.4.  
The following disease -related laboratory parameters will be  measured  during the study ( refer to  
Section  12 for PK/PD assessments) : 
• LDH  
• free hemoglobin 
• occult blood, urine 
• total C5  
• haptoglobin

• spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio  
• C-reactive protein  
10.3. PNH Symptomatology  
The I nvestigator or designee will record for each patient the presence or absence of the following 
signs and symptoms of PNH: fatigue, chest pain, abdominal pain, dyspnea, dysphagia, erectile 
dysfunction, and red/dark urine or hemoglobinuria.  
10.4. Patient- Reported Outcome Measures  
Two validated QoL scales will be administered to patients before study drug administration  at 
the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  7.3).  
• The FACIT -Fatigue scale, V ersion 4.[ADDRESS_70944] upon daily activities and function  over the preceding 7 days . Patients will 
score each item on a 5 -point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Total scores range 
from 0 to 52, with higher score indicating better QoL. 
• The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality 
of Life Questionnaire -Core 30 Scal e (QLQ -C30), Version 3.0, is a questionnaire 
developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. The questionnaire includes the 
following subscales: global health status, functional scales (physical functioning, role 
functioning, emotional functioning, cogniti ve functioning, and social activity), 
symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and single items (dyspnea, 
insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Thirty 
questions related to QoL, with the first [ADDRESS_70945] ions scored on a 4 -point scale (1  = not 
at all  to 4 = very much) and the final 2  questions that probe the patient’s overall 
health and QoL scored on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). Each subscale has a range of 0 to 100%, with a high score representing a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning but a high 
score for a symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology/problem.  
The FACIT -Fatigue and EORTC QLQ- C30 scales are provided  in Appendix B  and Appendix C , 
respective ly.  
10.5. Major Adverse Vascular Events  
Major adverse vascular events (MAVEs) will be assessed as part of the planned evaluation for 
AEs as described in Section  11.7. 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -[ADDRESS_70946] including the method of diagnosis (eg, magnetic resonance 
imaging, ultrasound, angiogram), date of diagnosis, and date resolved (or ongoing) will be

A MAVE is defined as follows: 
• Thrombophlebitis/deep vein thrombosis 
• Pulmonary embolus  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Transient ischemic attack  
• Unstable angina 
• Renal vein  thrombosis 
• Acute periphe ral vascular occlusion

The I nvestigator or his/her designee will meet with patients to discuss the potential safety  risks 
of ALXN1210 and eculizumab and to give the Investigator the opportunity to address any of the 
patient’s safety concerns regarding the study.  
Investigators are instructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion (resolution or 
stabilization), as described in  Section  11.7.6.  
The timing of the clinical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Section  7.3). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be 
followed until resolution or stabilization.  For the Roll -over Cohort, select data referenced in the 
following sections may be obtained from the prior studi es from which the patients rolled  over. 
11.1. Demographic/Medical History 
11.1.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
A review of demographic parameters, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be performed. A complete medical history will be taken and documented. Weight  and height will be 
recorded.  Height will be measured at Screening only. 
11.1.2. Disease Characteristics 
The patient’s PNH medical history, including PNH symptoms, date of diagnosis, PNH clone size, pRBC transfusions, and history of any MAVEs, will be documented at the Screening visit.  
11.1.3. Medical History  
The patient’s medical history, including prior and concomitant conditions/disorders  and 
transfusion history , will be recorded at the Screening Visit. Medication (prescription or over-the-
counter, including vitamins and/or herbal supplements) use within  [ADDRESS_70947] dose of study drug will 
also be recorded , as described in Section  9.7. 
11.2. Physical Examinations  
A physical examination will include the following assessments: general appearance; skin; head, 
ear, eye, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes ; chest;  heart; abdominal cavity; limb; central 
nervous system; and musculoskeletal system. An abbreviated physical examination consists of a 
body system relevant examination based upon Investigator judgment and patient  symptoms. 
11.3. Vital Signs

Alexion Confidential  11.4. Laboratory Assessments 
Samples for serum pregnancy, hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis  will be 
performed at the times specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  7.3). Specific 
laboratory assessments are provided in  Appendix D . Samples for laboratory assessments will be 
collected  before each study drug administration. If a suspected event of breakthrough hemolysis 
occurs, an unscheduled visit must take place at which a sample is collected for analysis of LDH 
and PK/PD  by [CONTACT_2237].  
Laboratory assessments will be tested at a central laboratory facility. Please refer to the 
Laboratory Manual for time windows for collection and detailed instructions for collecting, 
processing, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_65080]. Laboratory reports will 
be made available to the Investigators in a timely manner for clinical management of patients .  
It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to the underlying disease. T he Investigators should use their medical judgment when assessing the 
clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any v ariation in 
laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and which results in a change in medical 
care. If clinically significant laboratory changes from b aseline value are noted, the changes will 
be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to 
study treatment for all clinically significant out- of-range values (Section  14.9.3). The 
Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments until 
(1) values have returned to the  normal range or baseline level , or (2) in the judgment of the 
Investigator, values that are outside the normal  range are not related to the administration of 
study drug or other protocol- specific procedures.  
11.4.1. Pregnancy Testing  
For females of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test (ie, beta- huma n chorionic 
gonadotropin [β -hCG]) will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  7.3). 
11.4.2. Hematology  
Blood samples will be analyzed  for the hematology parameters listed in  Appendix D . 
11.4.3. Serum Chemistry  
Blood samples will be analyzed for the serum chemistry parameters listed in  Appendix D . 
Indirect bilirubin is calculated from total and direct bilirubin values; therefore, indirect bilirubin 
results will not be available if direct bilirubin is below the limit of quantification.  
Serum FSH  level s will be measured during S creening for postmenopausal female patients to 
confirm their postmenopausal status.  
Chemistry assessments will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Section  7.3). Estimated glomerular filtration rate will be calculated using the 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula  for all visits at which serum chemistries are 
collected.

Blood samples will be anal yzed for the coagulation parameters listed in Appendix D . 
11.4.5. Urinalysis and Urine Chemistry  
Urine samples will be analyzed for the parameters listed in Appendix D . A microscopic 
examination of urine samples will be performed if the results of the macroscopic analysis are 
abnormal. 
Urine samples will also be analyzed to measure proteins and creatinine in order to calculate the 
urine protein:creatin ine ratio.  
11.4.6. Virus Serology  
HIV testing for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency 
virus type 2 (HIV -2) is required for all patients prior to enrollment. Known HIV positive patients 
will not be enrolled.  
11.5. Electrocardiograms  
For each patient, single 12- lead digital ECGs will be collected according to the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Section  7.3). Patients must be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_70948] the Medical Monitor to discuss the patient’s continued eligibility to 
participate in this protocol. 
11.6. Immunogenicity 
Blood samples will be collected to test for presence and titer o f ADAs  to ALXN1210 or 
eculizumab  in serum prior to study drug administration as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Section  7.3). Further characterization of antibody responses may be conducted as 
appropriate, including binding and neutralizing antibodies, PK/PD, safety, and activity of ALXN1210 or eculizumab .  
11.7. Adverse Event  Management 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to th e medicinal product.  
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65081], admissions for social reasons or for convenience), and anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start  of the study that do not worsen are not AEs.

Alexion Confidential  Transfusions are treated as efficacy endpoints (see Section  6.2). Transfusions administered in the 
inpatient or outpatient setting should not be captured as AEs or SAEs unless identified as such by 
[CONTACT_737].  
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish drug effect.  
A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error.  
Cases of pregnan cy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to investigational product 
are to be reported  within 24 hours of I nvestigator/site awareness. Data on fetal outcome and 
breastfeeding will be  collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation.  
Adverse events should be recorded from the time of signed consent. An AE reported after informed consent but before  study drug administration  will be considered  a pre treatment AE.  
Alexion has reporting standards for AEs that are to be followed as described in S ection  11.7.6, 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  
11.7.1. Targeted Adverse Events 
As noted in Section  9.8, C5 inhibition is known to increase susceptibility to infections caused by 
[CONTACT_65125], particularly N. meningitidis . The following events are i mportant identified 
risks  in this study : 
• Meningococcal infections 
• Sepsis  
• Serious infections  
• Aspergillus infection  
• Infusion reactions  
Additional e vents of interest in this study include the following: 
• Serious cutaneous adverse reactions  
• Cardiac disorders ( including ventricular fibrillation ) 
• Angioedema 
11.7.2. Severity Assessment  
The severity of AEs will be graded using Common Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE ) version 4.03 or higher. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE term. Each 
CTCAE term is a Lowest Level Term ( LLT) per the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA
®). Each LLT will be coded to a MedDRA preferred term  (PT) . 
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE assigns a g rade of 1 through 5, with unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for eac h AE  (Table  14).

Grade 3  Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting  self-care ADLb 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death rela ted to AE.  
Abbreviations: ADL = activities of daily living ; AE = adverse event  
a  Instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
b  Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and 
not bedridden.  
Any change in the severity  of an AE should be documented based on specific guidelines in the 
eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated: severity describes the intensity of an AE, while 
the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met specific crit eria for an SAE  as described in 
Section  11.7.4. 
11.7.3. Causality Assessment  
An Investigator must provide a causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) for all AEs (both serious and nonserious) based upon the Investigator’s medical 
judgment and the observed symptoms associated with the event ( Table  15). This assessment 
must be recorded on the eCRF and any additional forms as appropriate.

the reported event.  
Unlikely Related  Suggests that the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_65082] a cause other than the

relationship between the investigational product  and AE cannot be excluded with 
complete confidence.  
Possibly Related  Suggests that treatment with the investigational product  may have caused or 
contributed to the AE (ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product , but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604]) . 
Probably Related  Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with the investigational 
product  administration exists and the likely causal association of the event with the 
investigational product. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of 
the investigational product, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the 
investigational product  or class of drugs, or judgment based on the Investigator ’s 
clinical experience.  
Definitely Related  Temporal relationship to the investigational product , other conditions (concurrent 
illness, concurrent medication reaction, or progression/expression of disease state) do 
not appear to explain event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, 
improvement on discontinuation, reap pearance on rechallenge.  
11.7.4. Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie, patient was at risk of death at the time of the event)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• Results in p ersistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. 
The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_57747], based on the current version of the 
IB. 
Information pertaining to the collection and reporting of SAEs is provided in Section  11.7.6.  
11.7.5. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are serious events that are not listed  
in the IB and that the I nvestigator identifies as related to investigational product or procedure. 
United S tates Title  21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32 and European Union Clinical 
Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent

All AEs (serious and nons erious) will be collected from the signing of the ICF for the o riginal 
Study ALXN1210- PNH -[ADDRESS_70949] be recorded on the eCRF upon the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence.  
Investigators will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, seriousness, and potential relatedness to study drug) to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) within [ADDRESS_70950] . 
If a patient’s treatment is d iscontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly 
capture the circumstances and data leading to any such dose interruption or discontinuation of treatment in the AE and Exposure pages of the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be recorded regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality.  No time limit 
exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. Investigators are at liberty to report SAEs irrespective of causality .  
For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following:  
• Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed below  
• Causality of the SAE(s)  
• Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s)  
• Outcome of the SAE(s)  
• Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnos tic information

information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion G DS via Safety 
Gateway.  
If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records sho uld be submitted to 
Alexion GDS  via the email address or fax number noted above.  
All paper forms and follow -up information submitted to the Sponsor outside of the Safety 
Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appropriate section of the study file.  
11.7.7. Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
Alexion GDS  or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current IB as the 
Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE w ill be 
determined by [CONTACT_57750].  
11.7.8. Investigator Reporting Requirements 
The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for the study Investigators. It is the Investigator’s  responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her 
site, as required per IRB/IEC standard operating procedures (SOPs). Investigators will also be 
notified of all S[LOCATION_003]R events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for 
notifying its IR B/IEC of these additional SAEs as per IRB/IEC SOPs.  
11.8. Exposure During Pregnancy and Lactation  
Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and a female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero ) can be the result 
of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal 
exposure. 
For all Alexion products, both in development or postapproval, exposure during pregnancy must 
be recorded and the pregnancy  followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, 
spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if 
the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws  from the study.  
If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this 
study, the I nvestigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form 
to Alexion GDS  via fax or email (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). When the outcome of the pregnancy 
becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS . If additional 
follow -up is r equired, the I nvestigator will be requested to provide the information.  
Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the 
“Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding”) and any AEs experienced by [CONTACT_65126] e mail or fa csimile  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_65083] a contraceptive medication. However,

criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, 
neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be 
reported as AEs.  
11.9. Safety Monitoring  
The Alexion M edical Monitor, GDS physician, or both will monitor safety data throughout the 
course of the study.

Section  14.2  through Section  14.10 describe the statistical methods and planned analysis for the 
Original Study  ALXN1210 -PNH-301 Cohort. 
The statistical method for the Roll- over C ohort is described in Section  14.11. 
Section  14.1  applies to both cohorts. 
14.1. General Considerations  
All data collected will be presented in summary tabulations. All data, as well as any outcomes 
derived from the data, will be presented in detailed data listings. Graphical displays may also be 
provided, when appropriate. All analyses will be performed using SAS® release, version 9.4 or 
higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) or other validated statistical software. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including number of observations and 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Categorical variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_65129]. All statistical tests performed will be based on a 2- sided 5% level of significance unless otherwise specified. Any and all exclusions 
will be doc umented in patient listings.   
Details of the statistical analyses described below will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) before database lock and analysis. Any change to the data analysis methods 
described in the protocol will requ ire an amendment only if it changes the primary or key 
secondary objectives or the study conduct. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol or SAP, and the justification for making the change, will be described 
in the clinical study report (CSR). Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted 
as deemed appropriate. 
A CSR will be produced based on efficacy, safety, PK, PD , and immunogenicity data collected 
through the end of the 26 -week randomized treatment period (Day 183) . A final CSR to 
summarize long -term efficacy, safety , PK, PD , and immunogenicity parameters will be produced 
at study completion. 
14.2. Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 214 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to  receive ALXN1210 
(N = 107) or eculizumab (N = 107) to ensure at least 193 evaluable patients (assum es no more 
than a 10% drop- out rate).  The sample size estimation is based on a noninferiority design 
comparing patients treated with ALXN1210 to those treated with eculizumab. Coprimary 
endpoints of hemolysis as directly measured by [CONTACT_65130] (LDH- N) from 
Day 29 through Day 183 and the proportion of patients who achieve transfusion avoidance (TA) 
through Day 183 will be used to assess noninf eriority. The sample size is  based on the endpoint 
that requires the larger number of patients.  
For the coprimary endpoint of LDH-N, using a noninferiority margin (NIM) based on the relative benefit of eculizumab with respect to placebo of 0.39 and a type I error of 1 -sided 2.5%, 
a minimum of 142 patients will provide 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority of ALXN1210 
to eculizumab. The NIM was determined based on a randomized placebo -controlled study 
(Hillmen, 2006) which  showed a relative benefit of eculizumab over placebo with an odds ratio 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -301   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Ame ndment 6, 12 April 2021  
 
Page 75 of 93 
Alexion Confidential  of 6.5. This was based on several factor s. As baseline LDH is a predictor of the rate of 
normalization, in order to preserve the constancy assumption, the rate of LDH- N was calculated  
adjusted to the observed baseline LDH of the current ALXN1210 Phase 1b and 2 data. The 
estimate of LDH -N for eculizumab was then calculated to be a weighted average of  the 
proportions of LDH -N from Day 29 to Day 183 to be consistent with the proposed analysis plan 
for this study. As the proportion of LDH- N for placebo treated patients was 0% at all visits, the 
upper bound of the 95% CI was used in order to be ab le to calculate an odds ratio. The final 
estimate of benefit was based on a LDH -N proportion of 42% for eculizumab -treated patients 
and 10% for placebo. A traditional choice of NIM is one with ≤ 50% loss of benefit resulting in a NIM of an odds ratio of 0.39. The calculation of NIM follows ( Ng, 2008) in which the NI M is 
given by 1/{OR
0.5} where OR represents the odds ratio of eculizumab compared to placebo  and 
is given by [0.42/(1-0.42)]/[0.1/(1-0.1)], and 0.5 is the fraction of benefit to be preserved. This approach chooses the NIM on the log odds scale, as describe d in Section IV of the 2010 Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry: Non -Inferiority Clinical Trials . While 
more conservative approaches for constructing NIMs could be used, such as using the lower bound of the 95% CI for eculizumab, the r esulting estimated sample size would make this study 
operationally infeasible in light of the rarity of PNH and the paucity of eculizumab -naïve 
patients.  
For the other coprimary  endpoint of proportion of patients not receiving any transfusions through 
Day 183, using a NIM of -20% and a type I error of 1-sided 2.5%, a minimum of 193 patients 
will provide 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority between the treatment arms. The NIM was 
determined based on the global PNH Registry for eculizumab- treated patients enrolling into the 
registry in 2012 or later (Soliris Type II Variation Proced ure No. EMEA/H/C/000791/II/66). 
History of transfusion is a predictor of on -treatment transfusion so to preserve the constancy 
assumption, the NIM was assessed based on available data from treated and untreated patients in proportion to enroll ment  expectat ions in the current study. Patients treated with eculizumab  (TA 
rate of 57.1%) showed a benefit over untreated patients (TA rate of 18.6%) with a difference of approximately 40% (38.5%) after adjustment for history of transfusions 12 months prior to enroll ment. The adjustment comes from an expected proportion of patients  without a history of 
transfusions to be no more than 20%. Enrolled patients for this study will be capped at 20% for patients without a history of transfusions to ensure constancy is satisfied .   
A traditional choice of NIM is one with ≤  50% loss of benefit which gives a NIM of 
approximately -20%. A more conservative NIM could be used using the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in rates, but the resulting estimated sample size wou ld make th e study 
operationally infeasible in light of the rarity of PNH and the paucity of eculizumab -naïve patients 
with and without a history of transfusions. Further, given the proportion of patients with TA observed in preliminary results from the Pha se 1b/2 program, it is expected that noninferiority 
can be demonstrated with more conservative NIMs for the given sample size with limited loss of 
power. 
Because the sample size estimate based on LDH-N is smaller  than that based on TA ( Table  16), 
the final sample size estimate selected for this study is based on the TA  endpoint. Adjusting for a 
possible 10% dropout rate, approximately 214 patients will be enrolled in this study.

14.3. Analysis Sets 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The coprimary efficacy 
endpoint analyses, as well as key secondar y endpoint analyses, will also be performed  on the Per 
Protocol (PP) set. The FAS is the primary population for all efficacy analyses.  The FAS will 
include all patients who receive d at least [ADDRESS_70954] of FAS patients who meet 
all of the following criteria:  
• Missed no doses of ALXN1210 or no more than 1 dose of eculizumab during the 
26-week randomized treatment period  
• Met i nclusion c riteria # 2, 3, and 4 
• Did not meet e xclusion c riteria # 1, 2, 3, or 4 
• Never received the wrong randomized treatment 
• Followed the protocol- specified transfusion guidelines  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set, defined as all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_70955] evaluable PK and PD data. 
14.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history and transfusion 
history, will be summarized by [CONTACT_65131], and Safety sets. No formal statistical comparisons will be made.

All patients will be included in the summaries of patient disposition, which will describe the 
frequency and percentage of patients screened and treated and who completed or withdrew from 
the study, along with reason for withdrawal from the study , by [CONTACT_1570].  
The numbers of patients who are treated, discontinue treatment (along with reason for treatment

reason for withdrawal ), enter the Extension P eriod , and complete or withdraw from the 
Extension P eriod  (along with reason for  withdrawal) will be tabulated b y treatment group and

14.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Nonp harmaco logic 
Procedures  
Each patient’s prior and concomitant medication use will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary, and the frequency and percentage of concomitant medications will be summarized. Medications will be summarized  by [CONTACT_65132]-Therapeut ic-Chemical 
(ATC) class and preferred drug name [CONTACT_65145] . 
14.7. Treatment Compliance 
The number of infusions received per patient will be tabulated by [CONTACT_65133].  
14.8. Efficacy  Analyses  
14.8.1. Coprimary Efficacy Analysis  
The co primary  efficacy endpoints are 1) the difference between treatment groups in the 
proportion of patients who achieve TA through Day 183, and 2) the relative effect between  
treatments in LDH -N from Day 29 through Day 183 expressed as an odds ratio .   
Transfusion avoidance will be achieved only by [CONTACT_65134] a transfusion and did not meet the protocol-specified guidelines for transfusion. The percentage of patients who achieve TA  with 95% CIs will be computed at Day 183 for both the ALXN1210 and 
eculizumab treatment groups and the randomization strata. A difference in the percentage of patients achieving TA  in the 2 treatment groups will be calculated between ALXN1210 and 
eculizumab  treatment groups , along with a 95% CI for the di fference. The difference between the 
ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups will be computed as a weighted combination of the differences between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups within stratification groups (using Mantel- Haenszel) . The 95% CI for the difference between ALXN1210 and 
eculizumab treatment groups will be calculated using the stratified Newcombe confidence interval method. 
LDH- N will be anal yzed using a generalized estimating equation ( GEE) approach which  
accounts for the repeated  measures of LDH -N at each visit ( Liang , 1986). The GEE approach 
provides odds ratios and CIs  of treatment effect while controlling for the correlation between 
visits for a given patient and other baseline factors. LDH-N from Day 29 through Day 183 will 
Protocol ALXN 1210- PNH -301   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Ame ndment 6, 12 April 2021  
 
Page 78 of 93 
Alexion Confidential  be used as the dependent variable and an indicator variable for treatment,  history of transfusion  
(as a categorical variable based on the stratification factor  levels), and baseline LDH level (as a 
continuous variable ) will  be included in the model as explanatory variables. The within -patient 
correlation will assume a first- order autoregressive structure which assumes the highest 
correlation is between visits that are closest in time. Day [ADDRESS_70956] scheduled asse ssment 
after initiation of maintenance dosing, and experience with eculizumab and Phase 1b/2 
ALXN1210 data demonstrate near maximal suppression of LDH by 4 weeks of treatment. Results from the model will be presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence inte rvals.     
In order to  conclude ALXN1210 is noninferior to eculizumab, both coprimary endpoints 
individually need to demonstrate noninferiority. If the lower-bound of the 95% CI for the 
difference (ALXN1210- eculizumab) is greater than the NIM of -20% for TA and the lower -
bound of the 95% CI for the odds ratio of ALXN1210 compared to eculizumab is greater than the NIM of 0.39 for LDH -N, then ALXN1210 treatment will be concluded to be noninferior to 
eculizumab.  
14.8.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The 4 key secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_65135] 26- week randomized treatment period. Change in FACIT -Fatigue ( and percent change in 
LDH) from baseline to W eek 26 will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM; Mallinckrodt, 2001, Mallinckrodt, 2004) with the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, the stratification randomization indicators of transfusion history (0, 1 to 14, or > [ADDRESS_70957] dose of study drug) and screening LDH levels (1.5 to < 3 × ULN or ≥  3 × ULN), study visit and study visit by [CONTACT_65136], fixed covariate of baseline FACIT- Fatigue (or LDH). For percent change in 
LDH, the baseline LDH level as a continuous variable will be included . The Kenward -Roger 
approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. A difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups along with a 2- sided 95% CI will be 
calculated.  
For breakthrough hemolysis and stabilized hemoglobin, the same approach used for TA will be employed. These key secondary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical manner provided that 
noninferiority was declared for the coprimary endpoints.  
When performing the analyses for the key secondary efficacy endpoints, a closed -testing 
procedure will be used so that the lack of significance of a test precludes assessment of 
subsequent tests. Estimates and CIs will be computed for all these key secondary efficacy 
endpoints irrespective of whether a lack of significance of a test precl udes assessment of 
subsequent tests.  
1. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups in the percentage change from Baseline to Week 26 in LDH is less than the NIM of 20%, then ALXN1210 will be declared non inferior for 
this parameter  and the next parameter will be tested . 
2. If the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and eculizumab treatment groups in change from baseline in FACIT -Fatigue is greater

Page 79 of 93 
Alexion Confidential  than the NIM of -5, then ALXN1210 will be declared noninferior for this parameter 
and the next para meter will be tested.  
3. If the upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and 
eculizumab treatment groups in the proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis is less than the NIM  of 20%, then ALXN1210 will be declared noninf erior  
for this parameter and the next parameter will be tested.  
4. If the lower  bound of the 95% CI for the difference between the ALXN1210 and 
eculizumab treatment groups in the proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin 
is greater than the NIM  of -20%, then ALXN1210 will be declared noninf erior for 
this parameter.  
If noninferiority is established for all key secondary endpoints, then superiority will be assessed using a closed-testing procedure with the following order and using a 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_70958] for each 
parameter:  
5. Proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis through Day 183 (Week 26) 
6. Percentage change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in LDH 
7. Hemolysis as directly measured by [CONTACT_26265] -N from Day 29 through Day183 (Week 26) 
8. Change from baseline to Day 183 (Week 26) in FACIT-Fatigue 
9. Proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin through Day 183 (Week 26) 
10. Transfusion avoidance  
Due to the hierarchical testing  order being pre specified, no adjustment of the type I error is 
required. 
14.8.3. Other Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Changes from baseline in EORTC- QLQ -C30 will be summarized by [CONTACT_65137]  (Section  7.3). Shifts from baseline 
in clinical manifestations of PNH will be summarized by [CONTACT_65138]. The number of any treatment -emerg ent MAVEs (n) and

A maximum number of approximately [ADDRESS_70960] throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be relevant to the patient’s  willingness to  continue his or her participation in the study. 
The ICF will be used to explain the potential risks and benefits of study participation to the 
patient  in simple terms before the patient  is entered into the study, and to document that the 
patient  is satisf ied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the 
study and desires to participate in the study. 
The Investigator or designee is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by [CONTACT_65140]’s lega l representative. This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures 
and dates on the ICF prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the 
administration of investigational product. The I nvestigator or designee must retain the original 
version of the signed ICF. If the ICF is amended, the original signed, amended version must also 
be retained. A copy of the signed ICF(s) must be given to the patient. 
As used in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all consent given by [CONTACT_65141].  
15.2. Safety Review  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_65142] (SMT). The SMT is a 
multidisciplinary team responsible for safety that meets monthly and, if needed, on an ad-hoc basis. The team is compo sed of Alexion subject matter experts involved in the studies (eg, 
Medical Monitors/Global Medica l Leads, Global Safety Leads). The objective of SMT review 
meetings is to ensure that emergent potential important safety concerns across all ALXN1210 clinical  studies are reviewed and evaluated and to make recommendations on continuing study 
drug administration or termination of the studies.   
15.3. Ethical Review

Alexion Confidential  APPENDIX A. MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL DRUG INFUSION 
REACTIONS  
 
Infusion of other monoclonal antibodies has been associated with infusion reactions, with onset 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_65077]. For this reason, patients will be 
carefully observed during each infusion.  
Patients who develop AEs of rash, hives, itching, or dysphagia of mild to moderate intensity 
during their infusion of ALXN1210 or eculizumab may continue to receive the infusion if 
deemed to be medically appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. Medical intervention may include, but is 
not limited to, slowing of the infusion rate (with or without treatment) or interrupting or  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_65084].  
Any acute reaction should be treated according to standard medical practice depending upon 
clinical signs and symptoms. If a patient requires medical intervention, the patient should remain at the investigational site until his or her condition stabilizes. The AE and any associated 
concomitant medications must be captured on the patient’s source document and electronic case 
report form (eCRF).   
Some patients treated with IV infusions of monoclonal antibodies have experienced concurrent 
reactions with signs or symptoms that can be classified as acute allergic 
reactions/hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release syndrome. Signs and symptoms include headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, 
erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, lightheadedness, 
hypotension, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and somnolence. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during an infusion; therefore, patients will be monitored closely during the infusion. In addition, the re -
administration of some monoclonal antibodies has been associated with serum sickness- like 
reactions manifesting [ADDRESS_70964] make certain that medication (ie, adren aline, inhaled beta agonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids) and 
other equipment to treat anaphylaxis are readily available. The infusion must be stopped 
immediately if Grade  ≥ 2 allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including drug fever) or Grade  ≥ 3 
cytokine release syndrome/acute infusion reaction occurs. The Sponsor must be notified within 
24 hours of any infusion reaction requiring interruption or discontinuation of study drug.  
Patients who experience a reaction during the administration of study dru g should be treated 
according to institutional guidelines. For a Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion reaction, the infusion 
should be temporarily stopped and treatment with an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine 25 to 
50 mg orally or equivalent) and acetaminophen (650 mg orally or equivalent) may be considered. 
If the patient’s signs and symptoms have resolved (with or without administration of the above medication), the infusion may be restarted. However, the patients should be infused at a slower 
rate and be monit ored closely for any signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during the 
remainder of the infusion. Patients experiencing an infusion reaction should be observed in the 
clinic until resolution of the reaction, or until the Investigator determines the patie nt is no longer 
at risk. Patients who experience a severe reaction during administration of study drug resulting in

Alexion Confidential  discontinuation of study drug should undergo all scheduled safety, PK, and PD evaluations 
required by [CONTACT_760]. 
If anaphylaxis occurs according to the criteria listed below, then administration of subcutaneous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1/1000, 0.3 mL to 0.5 mL , or equivalent) should be considered. In the case of 
bronchospasm, treatment with an inhaled beta agonist also should be considered. Patients 
administered an antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of an infusion reaction should be 
given appropriate warnings about drowsiness and impairment of driving ability before being 
discharged from the center.  
 
Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis: 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any 1 of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushi ng, swollen lips -tongue -uvula), and at least 1 of the following:

Products  Nintedanib/ placebo, idarubicin, cytarabine  
Summary of Rationale  Nintedanib is an oral VEGF inhibitor with a good tolerance profile. There is evidence  of a potential 
clinical impact of VEGF inhi bition in AML and some in vitro evidence of activity of Nintedanib 
against AML blasts. Given that outcome of relapse/refractory AML patient is poor and that no 
standard option is available for this group of patients, we anticipate that a combination of 
nintedanib+ induction chemotherapy may be an effective strategy for this group of patients.  
Treatment plan  Phase I: Patients who meet eligibility criteria and sign informed consent will receive  the following 
during an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408];  Idarubicin 12mg/m2/d IV Push over 10 -15 minutes  days 1 to 3 , 
cytarabine 0.667g/m2/d (24 hr .) IV infusion day 1 to 3  and Nintedanib 200mg BID PO  day 8 -28.  
There will be no drug administered on days 4 -7. Length of i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827525].  
 
Phase II:  Patients who meet eligibility criteria and sign informed consent will receive  the 
following during an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]; Idarubicin 12mg/m2/d IV Push over 10 -15 minutes 
days 1 to 3, cytarabine 0.667g/m2/d (24 h r.) IV infusion day 1 to 3 and Nintedanib 200mg BID PO 
on day 8 -28 OR placebo.  There will be no drug administered on days 4 -7. Length of i npatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827526].  
 
For both Phase I and II, a  maximum of 2 induction and 2 consolidation  cycles  may be given, cycles 
are 28 days .  
 
During Phase II, all Patients failing to achieve response based on IWG 2003 AML response criteria  
after cycle 1 will be unblinded, and all those who had been receiving placebo will be offered 
Ninteda nib+ chemotherapy (cross over)  for cycle 2 . Patients in the Nintedanib arm can be given 
a second cycle of Nintedanib.  
 
Nintedanib maintenance treatment  will be given to responding pts not eligible  for Hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation  (HCT) for up to two years or  until disease progression.  Patients eligible 
for HSCT will be taken off study prior to HSCT.

 1.2 Rational  
1.2.1  Outcome of Acute Myeloid Leukemias after failure of frontline treatment  
 
 Acute Myeloid Leukemia  (AML) is an aggressive malignant disorder  of the bone marrow, 
characteriz ed by [CONTACT_827562], 
ultimately resulting in bone marrow failure with infections and bleeding. Treatment with standard 
induction including an anthracycline and cytarabine results in complete response rate of 35% to 55% 
in patients with newly diagnosed AML 60 years old and older1 and 50% to 90% in younger patients . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_827528], most patients will eventually relapse.  
In first relapse, there is no single approach considered  standard and treatment i s selected based on 
the age of the patient and the duration of first CR. In patients 60 years old or older, intermediate 
dose cytarabine alone or in associat ion with another cytotoxic agent (idarubicin, daunorubicin, 
mitoxantrone or etoposide) is commonly used. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_827529], the second CR rate 
generally exceeds 3 0%2,3. However the median overall survival is ≤ [ADDRESS_1148171] been tested prospectively tested in 
randomized trial in the settings of patients with AML experiencing early relapse or refractoriness to induction. To date, none of them  demonstrated a clear benefit on overall survival and there is no 
registered drug  approved for this indication . Thus  there is a strong unmet medical need for  this 
situation  
 
1.2.2  Rational for targeting VEGF/VEGF- R pathway in AML  
 
 While multiple cytokines promote AML proliferation and survival, v ascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) likely plays an important role as a paracrine and/or autocrine mediator. Greater 
than 85% of bone marrow biopsies from patients with AML express VEGF significantly higher than normal bone marrows [reviewed in (Kampe n, Ter Elst et al. 2013
4]. VEGF receptors are also 
commonly expressed on leukemic blasts from patients with AML4. In particular, VEGFR -[ADDRESS_1148172] proliferation and survival in vitro10,14,15. VEGF signaling 
in AML leads to activation of Bcl- 2, HSP, MAPK and PI3K15. AML bone marrow biopsies often 
demonstrate increased micro -vessel density compared to normal bone marrow and AML in 
remission16-18. VEGF stimulates osteoblasts and osteoclasts and may lead to remodeling of the stem 
cell niche19-21; to what extent this impacts leukemia stem cells (LSC) is not clear.  
VEGF antagonists have demonstrated little clinical activity as monotherapy in relapsed or refractory 
AML16,22,[ADDRESS_1148173] exposure at a time point planned to coincide with the peak of cytokine -stimulated regrowth of residual leukem ia cells . This approach 
led to superior leukemia-free survival in a pediatric population
31 as well as in an adult po pulation32 
(French). However, timed sequential therapy ha s led to longer aplasia duration than a single cycle of 
“seven plus three” (cytarabine plus anthracycline) and has not been widely adopted. Building on this model, Karp and colleagues
30 studied a three day infusion of cytarabine in combination with 
mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed and refractory AML. Historical experience with this combination indicated that remissions were not likely with these drugs alone.  
The VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab was administered on day 8, in lieu of the second drug exposure in the timed sequence (Figure 1):

Of [ADDRESS_1148174] relapse; [ADDRESS_1148175] relapse. Toxicities were as 
expected with intensive reinduction therapy; additional AEs attributed to the known toxicity profile of bevacizumab were observed. 7 patients experienced induction death.  
Importantly, residual leukemia was morphologically detectable in 38/48 patients on day 8 prior to bevacizumab. On Day 15 (one week following bevacizumab), 28/48 patients had cleared morphologic leuk emia. 16 patients achieved complete remission, including 2/3 newly diagnosed poor -risk AML, 
9/[ADDRESS_1148176] remission, and 5/27 patients with primary refractory disease. 7 patients 
achieved PR, for an overall response rate of 48% following one cycle  of treatment. VEGF receptor 
FLT-1 on bone marrow cells was greater than in normal bone marrow in 12/13 patients examined. On 
day 8, blasts continued to express FLT- 1 in 8/10 patients. Serum free -VEGF was detectable in 14/21 
patients prior to treatment (median concentration 12 pg/mL). Day 8 concentrations were higher than on day 0 in 11 patients including 4 patients in whom VEGF had been undetectable, while VEGF concentration had decreased in 6.

 Among 15 patients in whom serum was sampled two hours following bevacizumab infusion, 10 had 
complete suppression of detectable VEGF, while 4 patients had VEGF concentrations ranging from 24 – 82% of the pre -bevacizumab baseline. Sequential examination of bone marrow microvessel density 
revealed significant decrease s in 8/[ADDRESS_1148177] from the Johns Hopkins group and the Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program. (Personal communication).  
 
1.2.3  Nintedanib, an oral VEGF inhibitor  
 
Nintedanib33,34 is an orally bioavailable VEGF R inhibitor with an IC50 ranging from 100 – 300 nM. 
Nintedanib also inhibits the different isoforms of FGF  and PDGFR. In a trial in lung cancer in 
combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in non -small cell lung cance r35, mean Cmax was 63 
ng/mL, similar to that in monotherapy trials36-39 and in combination with docetaxe l in prostate cancer 
patients . Nintedanib administration was associated with decrements in plasma soluble VEGFR2.  
Nintedanib is being investigated in several cancer indications40. Two completed phase III NSCLC35,41 
studies and one phase III in ovarian cancer is still ongoing; the development for colorectal cancer, 
renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma is in phase II. Additionally, nintedanib is als o 
registered for the non -cancer indication idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)  42,43 (150mg bid) . As of [ADDRESS_1148178] 
been treated with nintedanib. Among the cancer patients, 672 were treated with monotherapy, 1255 
with combination of nintedanib and various backbone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 162 with the combination of 
afatinib44, an EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, approved in the treatment of patients with NSCLC carrying EGFR 
mutation and 30 patients with the combination of volasertib, a PLK1 inhibitor.  1351patients were 
treated with either nintedanib or nintedanib -matching placebo in ongoing blinded studies.  
Based on the phase I dose escalation trials36-39, the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) was determined 
to be 250 mg bid for twice daily dosing in Caucasians and 200 mg bid in Japanese patients45 with a

 1.5 Treatment Plan  
1.5.1  Global treatment strategy  
 
Phase I:  This is an initial exploratory phase to confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination 
of Nintedanib+chemotherapy  The AML chemotherapy induction and consolidation regimen occur at 
an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827530] [ADDRESS_1148179] of Care (SOC) per local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472836]. The  induction and consolidation regimen combines Idarubicin 12mg/m2/d IV p ush over 10 -15 
minutes day s 1 to 3 and Cytarabine 0.667g/m2/d (24 h r. IV infusion ) day 1 to 3. During Phase I, all 
patients will receive  the combination  chemotherapy in addition to  Nintedanib 200mg bid starting at 
Day 8 through  day 28 (end of cycle ). If a significant incidence of dose limiting toxicities is 
demonstrated, Nintedanib will be given at a lower dose level (150mg bid).  Patients may be 
discharged based on local site SOC  and re -admitted prior to the start of the next cycle however, 
some patients will stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827531] (especially between the first two induction cycles).  Induction cycle 2 can begin as early as study day 29 regardless of count recovery statu s if the 
investigator believes it would be clinically beneficial.  Patients can be given a “break” between cycles of induction based on investigator’s clinical judgement and clinical response.  Count  recovery is 
necessary before a consolidation cycle can b egin. If count recovery is not achieved 60 days after 
Cycle 1  Day 1 , the patient is removed from the study.  
Phase II: Based on the phase I dose, i n the  randomized phase II , the combination of chemotherapy + 
Nintedanib will be compared with chem otherapy+placebo. The AML chemotherapy induction and 
consolidation regimen occur at an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827530] [ADDRESS_1148180] of Care (SOC) per local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361]. The  induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimen for 
Phase II are identical to that in Phase I and combines Idarubicin 12mg/m2/d IV push over 10 -15 
minutes days 1 to 3 and Cytarabine 0.667g/m2/d (24 hr. IV infusion) day 1 to 3. In P hase I I, patients 
will be randomized to receive the combination chemotherapy in addition to  Nintedanib (dose 
determined in Phase I) at Day 8 through  day 28 (end of cycle)  or placebo  at Day 8 until day 28 (end of 
cycle). . Patients may be discharged b ased on local SOC  and re -admitted prior to the start of the next 
cycle however, some patients will stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827531] (especially between the first two induction cycles). Induction cycle 2 can begin as early as study day 29 regardless of count recovery status  if the investigator believes it would be clinically beneficial.  Patients can be given a “break” 
between cycles of induction based on investigator’s clinical judgement and clinical response.  Count recovery is necessary before a consolidation cycle can be gin. If count recovery is not achieved [ADDRESS_1148181]. Patients without count recovery and 
without signs of bone marrow leukemia at day 45 will be  followed up to day 60. If no recovery is 
observed at day 60, patients will be removed  from protocol and considered a failure.  
In phase I, p atients who fail to achieve CR or CRp based on IWG 2003 AML response criteria (pg. 77) 
after first cycle of treatment may receive a second cycle of treatment using Nintedanib+  
chemotherapy . Patients who achieve CR or CRp after one or two  induction cycle s may receive up to 2  
cycle s of consolidation using the same regimen.  
In phase II, p atients failing to achieve response based on IWG 2003 AML response criteria after cycle 
1 will be unblinded, and all those who had been receiving placebo wi ll be offered a cycle of 
Nintedanib+ chemotherapy (cross over). Patients in the Nintedanib arm may receive a second 
induction cycle of Nintedanib.  Based on clinical judgement, patients can receive up to 2 cycles of 
consolidation after induction cycle (s) are complete. 
Patients are eligible for allogeneic transplantation as soon as remission is achieved  and a donor is 
identified.  All transplant procedures occur off study .  For responding patients  not eligible for 
transplantation , maintenan ce therapy with Ni ntedanib /Placebo will be provided until documented 
progression.  
Patients should NOT start Cycle 1 day 1 on a Thursday or Friday in order to facilitate sample 
collection, processing and shipment to Sponsor to avoid weekend deliveries.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Criteria to restart nintedanib/placebo treatment 
 
A patient is eligible to restart nintedanib (BIBF1120)/placebo if all criteria listed in table 2 are 
met. If a patient has to interrupt intake of nintedanib/placebo due to an adverse event for more than 
7 days, the decision to restart treatment with ninted anib (BIBF1120) needs to be discussed and 
agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose adjustments during treatment 
After cycle 1, if the lifetime cumulative dose of anthracycline reaches 500mg/m2, idarubicin will be 
switched to etoposide 1 00mg /m2/d day 1 to 3.  
In case of severe hematologic or non -hematologic adverse events, dose of 
nintedanib/idarubicin/cytarabine  could be adjus ted for the subsequent cycles of treatment  
(IDA/CYTA) or when NINTEDANIB is restarted . Dose adjustment should be systematically discussed 
with coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_827532].  
Given the toxicity profile of the different drugs it is likely that hematological toxicities will be related to idarubicin and/or cytarabine and dose adjustment will be done accordingly. Drugs are dose 
reduced  independent ly and after discussion with the Protocol PI.  Specific procedure should be 
applied in case of potential drug induced liver toxicity ( see Appendices section).

 Recommended dose adjustments for Nintedanib (BIBF1120)  
As an initial measure for the management of side effects treatment with nintedanib should be  
temporarily interrupted until the specific adverse reaction has resolved to levels that allow  
continuation of therapy. Nintedanib treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose. Dose  
adjustments in 100 mg steps per day (i.e. a 50 mg reduction per dosing) bas ed on individual  
safety and tolerability are recommended as described in Table  4 shown below . In case of  
further persistence of the adverse reaction(s), i.e. if a patient does not tolerate 100 mg twice  
daily, treatment with nintedanib should be disconti nued. 
 
Phase II dose reduction will be dependent on the MTD determined in Phase I. Dose  
reductions during phase II will be managed in 50mg increments to a minimum dose of  
100mg.   Patients who cannot tolerate the 100mg dose will be taken off treatment.

  *CTCAE: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
Nintedanib AML V ersion  7 21 MAY 2019 
21 
  
Patients should PERMANENTLY discontinue treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) in the event of: 
• Intolerable Adverse Events (CTCAE grade 3 or 4) that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_827563].  
• Withdrawal of informed consent.  
 
1.6 Definition of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during phase I  
 
In order to determine safety of the combination, all adverse events will be recorded on the 
case report forms and graded using the NCI CTC criteria (v ersion 4.0 3). Toxicities not listed on the 
CTC will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The local Investigator, in consultation with the 
clinical staff caring for the patient, and the Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_827534] 
(unrelate d, unlikely, possibly related, probably related, related). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be 
either as specified below; for organ systems not included, DLT will also include any Grade III or IV non-hematologic toxicity thought possibly or probably related to study drug administration.  
Specifically defined DLTs: Drug- related vomiting and nausea CTCAE grade >/= 2 for 5 or more 
consecutive days despi[INVESTIGATOR_827535]. Drug -related diarrhea CTCAE grade >/= 2 
persisting for 8 or more consecutive days despi[INVESTIGATOR_44782]. Drug -related hypertension 
CTCAE grade >/= 3 despi[INVESTIGATOR_827536].  
Drug- related transaminase elevation (ALT and/or AST) CTCAE grade > /= 3 or transaminase elevation 
CTCAE grade >/= 2 (ALT and/or AST) in conjunction with bilirubin CTCAE grade >1.  A ll o th e r d ru g -
related non -hematological  toxicities of CTCAE grade >/= 3, except for isolated GGT increases.  A ll

BIBF 1120 treatment for >/=[ADDRESS_1148195] bone marrow assessed at physician's discretion by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_1148196] not recovered by [CONTACT_4475] 60 and there is no morphologic 
evidence of leuk emia, this will be considered a nintedanib - associated hematologic DLT.

 If <2/6 patients experience Nintedanib attributable dose limiting toxicity, we will proceed to the 
randomized Phase II trial. If >/= 2 patients experience attributable DLT, six additional patients will be 
treated with dose level - 1 of nintedanib (150 mg BID). Assuming that <2/6 patients experience 
Nintedanib attributable dose lim iting toxicity at the reduced dose, we will proceed to the randomized 
Phase II trial - 1 dose level of nintedanib .

 1.7 Statistical plan  
 
The feasibility phase is structured similar to a classic 3 + [ADDRESS_1148197] Phase I studies, this dose will be considered feasible if <2/[ADDRESS_1148198] the hypothesis that arm A  (nintedanib+chemotherapy)  will have a complete response rate of 40% after one cycle of 
treatment compared to 15% in arm B (Placebo+chemotherapy). Estey, Thall, and David reviewed the 
outcomes of salvage therapy for AML
48. They stratified patients based on length of first remission 
(S1: if greater than 2 years) and whether the therapy was first or subsequent salvage (S2: first 
remission 1 – 2 years, S3: First remission [ADDRESS_1148199] salvage: S4: First remission 0 – 1 year, 
receiving > first salvage). CR rates for S2, 3, and 4 were 47%, 14%, and 0. We will no t be treating S1 in 
this protocol. Thus, a 40% response rate appears to be very robust for a mix of S2 to S4 patients. 
While it is highly unlikely that the control (placebo) arm will have a comparable CR rate, without the control arm the success of the add ition of nintedanib will not be clear. Using the group sequential 
design we will minimize the number of patients receiving placebo. For example, if 0/[ADDRESS_1148200], if 5/[ADDRESS_1148201]  at the site.  The group sequential design allows termination of either arm at 
early time points due to either f utility or  efficacy. In a randomized Phase II trial, each arm is 
compared to a historic control. The studies are not powered to officially compare the arms. Rather, 
they serve as “pi[INVESTIGATOR_323763]” strategies. The null hypothesis is that each arm achieves a  15% 
response rate. The trial is powered to select an arm (presumably the experimental arm) which achieves a 40% response rate. At the point at which either arm can no longer demonstrate a 40% response rate, the arm is terminated for futility . Each arm is monitored following each accrual 
beginning with patient 8. The design assumes overall Type I error of 10% (1 -sided) and 80% power.

Patients may not receive chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any investigational antineoplastic 
agent. Immunosuppressive agents are prohibited during the c ourse of trial participation. Systemic 
and chronic inhaled steroids may not be used during participation, with the exception of intermittent use of corticoids for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, or as part of an anti- emetic regime or as 
treatment of immunoallergic reactions during platelets or blood transfusions. 
 
During the induction  cycle s, G- and GM -CSF may be used only in case of prolonged neutropenia or 
neutropenic sepsis if non -blastic aplasia is obtained; there will be no such constraints in su bsequent 
cycles.  Use of growth factors during consolidation and maintenance is allowed.  
Antibiotics and antifungals can be given according to institutional rules.  Antifungal prophylaxis  with 
systemic azoles (fluconazole, voriconazole) should be avoided d ue to the risk of liver toxicity. For 
other drugs, See drug interaction paragraph below for details.  
Patients should receive all necessary supportive care, including blood product transfusions, erythropoietin, and pain medications. The related information will be reported in the CRF. Given the risk of bleeding shown with Nintedanib in previous studies, it  is recommended to maintain platelet 
levels above 10^9/L.  in the absence of platelet refractoriness.  Moreover, the use of anticoagulation 
during treatment should be limited if possible and if therapeutic anticoagulation is mandatory, discontinuation of Nintedanib need to be discussed with principal investigator.  
All treatments given in addition to the st udy treatment(s) on entry to the study or at any time during 
the study are regarded as concomitant treatments and must be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF.

 1.12 Drug interactions  
 
 Nintedanib is a substrate of P -gp. Co administration with the pote nt P-gp inhibitor 
ketoconazole increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61 fold based on AUC and 1.83 fold based on Cmax 
in a dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug interaction study with the potent P -gp 
inducer rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3 % based on AUC and to 60.3 % based 
on Cmax upon co -administration with rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_230802]. If 
co-administered with nintedanib, potent P -gp inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole or erythromycin) may 
increase exposure to nintedanib. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability 
of nintedanib. Co administration with nintedanib should be carefully considered.  
Potent P -gp inducers (e.g. rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, and St. John’s Wo rt) may decrease 
exposure to nintedanib. Co administration with nintedanib should be carefully considered.  
Cytochrome (CYP) enzymes: Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib depends on  
CYP pathways. Nintedanib and its metabolites, the free acid moiety BIBF 1202 and its glucuronide BIBF 1202 glucuronide, did not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes in preclinical studies. The likelihood of drug- drug interactions with nintedanib based on CYP metabolism is therefore considered to be low.

Sampling flow chart  
Peripheral Blood (PB)=20  ml EDTA, bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (BMA)= 8 ml baseline, 5- 6 ml follow -up, Bone marrow biopsy 
(BMB), * potential significant hypoplasia  
• Baseline (day - 14 to – 5):  PB, BMA, BMB 
• Day 8 (day [ADDRESS_1148213] ch emo, day 0 of Nintedanib) = PB*  
• Day 8 OPTIONAL CONSENT (day [ADDRESS_1148214] chemo, day 0 of Nintedanib) = BMA  
• Day 14 (day [ADDRESS_1148215] chemo, day 6 of Nintedanib) = PB*, BMA*, BMB*  
• Day 28 (day [ADDRESS_1148216] chemo, day 20 of Nintedanib) =  PB, BMA, BMB  
• End of Treatment= PB, BMA , BMB  
 
Correlative studies  
1/ Genomic profiling (baseline)  
There is a significant diversity in molecular profiling of relapse/refractory AML and specific 
aberrations may be associated with differential response to chemo/nintedanib. Moreover,  it is 
anticipated that several of the pathways that will be evaluated by [CONTACT_827567] (e.g. FLT3 ITD and STAT).  
Objective : Determine the mutational landscape  of the population. Correlate  with response and 
pathway a ctivation  
Methods : Whole exome sequencing/ Ion Torrent 490 gene panel  / RNA sequencing 
 
2/ Bone Marrow microvessel density (Baseline, day 14, day 28)  
 
Microvessel density is a classical pharmacodynamic read out of VEGF inhibition. It can be evaluated 
on BM  biospi[INVESTIGATOR_827539] : determine the density of microvessel on bone marrow biopsies and correlate it with 
Nintedanib exposure and response  
Methods : Immunostaining on BM trephine biopsy sample (VWF, CD31, CD34 staining)  
Optional= Stem cell niche evaluation

 3/ VEGF expression levels (Baseline, day 8, 14, and 28)  
VEGF can be secreted by [CONTACT_827568]. Bone Marrow stress induced by [CONTACT_827569] a VEGF response  
that may subsequently affect survival of AML blast and normal cells recovery pattern. VEGF inhibition by [CONTACT_827570].  
Objective: Determine patterns of VEGF expression before and during trea tment. Evaluate the effect 
of Nintedanib on these patterns. Correlate it with Response  
Methods: Quantitative assessment by [CONTACT_6428] (Quantikine R&D).  
Optional: Aliquoted frozen serum will be stored and can be used to evaluate other cytokines related 
to Ninte danib (FGF, PDGF).  
 
4/ Nintedanib target receptors and downstream pathways analysis (Baseline, day 8, 14, and 
28) 
Nintedanib is inhibiting the 3 isoforms of VEGFR, (1 to 3) the 3 isoforms of FGF (1 to 3), and the 2 
isoforms of PDGFR (A and B). With the exception of FGFR2, all of these receptors have been described in subsets of AML. Downstream pathways are converging to PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, and STAT 
signaling. As previously mentioned some of these pathways may be constitutively active or triggered 
by [CONTACT_827571] L related pathways.  
Objective: Determine the expression pattern for the receptors and pathways (pAKT, pERK, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5 will be evaluated ) before and during treatment .  Correlate it with baseline molecular 
profile, Nintedanib exposure, and clinical response.  
Methods: CyToF (Viability, Gating, Pathways, apoptosis)  
Backup  plan/ validation= IHC on BM trephine biospi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Flash frozen sample vs FFPE?)  
 
5/ Evaluation of Nintedanib impact in specific cell subsets (Baseline, day 8, 14, and 28) 
The effect of Nintedanib may be different according to the cell types and it may consequently 
influence response, toxicity, and risk of relapse. It seems interesting to evaluate Leukemic Stem Cells 
subpopulation (CD45+, CD34+, CD38 -, CD123+, CD90 -) marrow stro mal cells (CD45 -, CD31 -, CD34 -, 
CD73+, CD90+, CD105+) , peripheral blood/ marrow endothelial cells (CD45 -, CD31+, CD34+, 
CD105+/ -) lymphocytes (CD45+, CD3+ or CD19+), and potentially residual normal hematopoietic 
stem cells (CD45+, CD34+, CD38 -, CD123+, CD 90+)  
Objective: Evaluate the differences of impact of Nintedanib in AML cells vs the above mentioned  
subtypes (LSC, MSC, CEC, Lymphocytes)  
Methods: Cytof (Viability, Gating, pathways, apoptosis)

 Optional: Cell culture assays. When adequate cells are presen t, bone marrow mononuclear cells will 
be plated in methylcellulose for determination of CFU -L, a surrogate for leukemic stem cells. By 
[CONTACT_827572] 14 marrow CFU-L growth in patients on the two treatment arms, we can gain insight 
into whether nintedanib i nhibits the proliferation and survival of leukemic stem cells (ie patients in 
chemo arm  should grow more CFU- L on day 14 than patients in arm nintedanib+chemo ).

 healthy volunteers were only of CTCAE grade 1 severity and fully reversible.  
Regarding the phase I trials combining nintedanib with pemetrexed, docetaxel, paclitaxel/ 
carboplatin, mFOLFOX or gemcitabine/cisplatin, the recommended dose of nintedanib is [ADDRESS_1148223] increases. In patients with advanced NSCLC, nintedanib showed comparable signs 
of efficacy in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-[ADDRESS_1148224] signs of efficacy of nintedanib for ovarian cancer patients as well as in Asian patients with advance d hepatocellular carcinoma (1199.39), advanced colorectal cancer based on the data from 
phase II combination trial 1199.51with mFOLFOX6 and in Renal Cell Carcinoma (1199.26).  
Based on the overall safety profile, 200 mg bid of nintedanib is the recommended  phase III dose for 
combination treatments with pemetrexed, docetaxel and paclitaxel/carboplatin. Available pharmacokinetic data indicate that the systemic exposure needed for biological activity can be achieved starting with doses of [ADDRESS_1148225] to the phase III trials, nintedanib in combination with docetaxel (1199.13) and in combination with pemetrexed (1199.14) in patients with advanced non -small- cell-lung- cancer 
(NSCLC), the safety of nintedanib in combination with either docet axel or pemetrexed was in line 
Nintedanib AML V ersion  [ADDRESS_1148226] frequent adverse events. Overall, adverse events were manageable in the majority of patients with symptomatic therapy and dose reductions. Nintedanib in combination with docetaxel 
significantly prolonged PFS in patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC after failure of first -line 
chemotherapy. In the adenocarcinoma population, nintedanib plus docetaxel significantly pro longed 
centrally assessed PFS and OS. In the combination with pemetrexed, the addition of nintedanib to pemetrexed showed a relevant prolongation of PFS by [CONTACT_388361], compared with placebo plus pemetrexed, although the trial was stopped pr ematurely.  
Additional precautions for nintedanib (BIBF1120)  
• Diarrhea  
Diarrhea was the most frequently reported gastro -intestinal event and appeared in close 
temporal relationship with the administration of docetaxel in the clinical trial LUME -Lung 1. 
The majority of patients had mild to moderate diarrhea. 6.3 % of  the patients had diarrhea of 
grade ≥3 in combination treatment compared to 3.6 % treated with docetaxel alone. 
Diarrhea should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and anti -diarrheal 
medicinal products, e.g. loperamide, and may require interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib.  
 
• Nausea and vomiting  
Nausea and vomiting, mostly of mild to moderate severity, were frequently reported 
gastrointestinal adverse events in the clinical trial LUME -Lung 1. Interruption, dose reduction 
or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) may be required despi[INVESTIGATOR_683630]. Supportive care for nausea and vomiting may include medicinal 
produ cts with anti -emetic properties, e.g. glucocorticoids, anti- histamines or 5 -HT3 receptor 
antagonists and adequate hydration.  In the event of dehydration, administration of 
electrolytes and fluids is required. Plasma levels of electrolytes should be monitored, if relevant gastrointestinal adverse events occur.  
 
Pharmaceutical/Drug Distribution

on nucleic acid synthesis and interacts with the enzyme topoisomerase II. The absence of a methoxy 
group at position 4 of the anthracycline structure gives the compound a high lipophil icity which 
results in an increased rate of cellular uptake compared with other anthracyclines.  Its principal 
indication is the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (frontline and relapse) in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine in part icular.  
General Pharmacokinetics:  Pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in adult leukemia patients 
with normal renal and hepatic function following intravenous administration of 10 to 12 mg/m2 of 
Idarubicin daily for [ADDRESS_1148229] described by a two or three compartment open model. The elimination rate of Idarubicin from plasma is slow with an estimated mean terminal half- life of 22 
hours (range, 4 to 48 hours) when used as a single agent and 20 hours (range, 7 to 38 hours) when used in combination with cytarabine. The elimination of the primary active metabolite, Idarubicinol, is considerably slower than that of the parent drug with an estimated mean terminal half- life that 
exceeds 45 hours;  hence, its plasma levels are sustained for a period greater than 8 days.  
Distribution:  The disposition profile shows a rapid distributive phase with a very high volume of 
distribution presumably reflecting extensive tissue binding. Studies of cellular (nu cleated blood and 
bone marrow cells) drug concentrations in leukemia patients have shown that peak cellular Idarubicin concentrations are reached a few minutes after injection. Concentrations of Idarubicin and Idarubicinol in nucleated blood and bone marrow cells are more than a hundred times the plasma 
concentrations. Idarubicin disappearance rates in plasma and cells were comparable with a terminal 
Nintedanib AML V ersion  [ADDRESS_1148230] dose, is 1.7 - and 2.3 -
fold, respectively, and suggests no change in kinetics following a d aily x 3 regimen. The percentages 
of Idarubicin and Idarubicinol bound to human plasma proteins averaged 97% and 94%, respectively, 
at concentrations similar to maximum plasma levels obtained in the pharmacokinetic studies. The binding is concentration ind ependent. The plasma clearance is twice the expected hepatic plasma 
flow indicating extensive extrahepatic metabolism.  
Metabolism:  The primary active metabolite formed is Idarubicinol. As Idarubicinol has cytotoxic 
activity, it presumably contributes to the effects of Idarubicin. 
Elimination:  The drug is eliminated predominately by [CONTACT_827574] a lesser extent by [CONTACT_13624], 
mostly in the form of Idarubicinol.  
Hepatic and Renal Impairment:  The pharmacokinetics of Idarubicin have not been evaluated in  
leukemia patients with hepatic impairment. It is expected that in patients with moderate or severe hepatic dysfunction, the metabolism of Idarubicin may be impaired and lead to higher systemic drug levels. The disposition of Idarubicin may be also affected by [CONTACT_368459]. Therefore, a dose reduction should be considered in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment  
Severe myelosuppression will occur in all patients given a therapeutic dose of this agent for induction, consolidation or maintenance. Careful hematologic monitoring is required. Deaths due to 
infection and/or bleeding have been reported during the period of severe myelosuppression. Pre -
existing heart disease and previous therapy with anthracyclines at high cumulative doses or other 
poten tially cardiotoxic agents are co -factors for increased risk of Idarubicin- induced cardiac toxicity 
and the benefit to risk ratio of Idarubicin therapy in such patients should be weighed before starting 
treatment with Idarubicin. Myocardial toxicity as mani fested by [CONTACT_827575], acute life -threatening  arrhythmias or other cardiomyopathies may occur following therapy 
with Idarubicin.  So cardiac function should be carefully monitored during treatment in order to minimize the ris k of cardiac toxicity of the type described for other anthracycline compounds. The 
risk of such myocardial toxicity may be higher following concomitant or previous radiation to the 
mediastinal-pericardial area or in patients with anemia, bone marrow depression, infections, 
leukemic pericarditis and/or myocarditis. Idarubicin was embryotoxic and teratogenic in the rat at a dose of 1.2 mg/m2/day or one tenth the human dose, which was nontoxic to dams. Idarubicin was embryotoxic but not teratogenic in the rabbit even at a dose of 2.4 mg/m2/day or two tenths the human dose, which was toxic to dams. There is no conclusive information about Idarubicin adversely 
Nintedanib AML V ersion  [ADDRESS_1148231] effective drug in the treatment of AML (Döhner M., 2010). It 
is a cell-cycle specific anti- metabolite that is phosphorylated intracellularly and incorporated into 
DNA, resulting in the inhibition of DNA polymerases a nd DNA synthesis. For initial treatment of AML, 
cytarabine is typi[INVESTIGATOR_827541] 5 -7 days at doses of 100 -
200 mg/m2/day, usually in combination with an anthracycline. In the relapsed setting, cytarabine remains an  option for treatment but is generally administered at higher doses either alone or in 
combination with other agents, and in a variety of schedules. Cytarabine is a well -known myelotoxic 
drug. High dose cytarabine (2 to 3 g/m2/day) regimens may cause sever e non -hematologic adverse 
events, including the following: mucositis, diarrhea, ileus, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, skin rash, anaphylaxis, non- cardiogenic pulmonary edema, cholestatic jaundice, elevations of transaminases 
and alkaline phosphatase, and cerebral and cerebrellar dysfunction. Because of those toxicities, intermediate -dose cytarabine (500 mg to 1 g/m2/day) regimens are generally used in patients 60 
years old or older [Milano G., 2002].  
Elimination of cytarabine is rapid with biphasic kinetics characterized  by [CONTACT_827576]- life 
of [ADDRESS_1148232] be converted in the cells into 
the 5’triphosphate ara -CTP to be active. In plasma, cytarabine is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_827542] a inactive metabolite: Uracil arabinoside (Ara- U). Ara -U is the 
major metabolite and the only one detectable in plasma. This deamination mechanism is not saturated even at high dose (up to 3 g/m2/day) [Liliemark JO, 1985]. Given that cytarabine is activated intracellularly, no relationship is evidenced between cytarabine plasma concentrations and 
cytotoxic effects. In addition,  there is no correlation between cytarabine plasma concentrations and 
Ara-CTP intracellular concent rations [Milano G., 2002]. Indeed,  the accumulation of Ara-CTP into cells 
appears to be saturated at plasma concentrations above a rate of administration of 250mg/m2/h 
[Milano G., 2002]. [Plunkett W., 1992].  
Given the unique metabolism pathway of cytarabine involving specific enzyme (cytidine deaminase) and the rate limited accumulation of intracellular Ara- CTP, any clinically relevant interaction of 
Nintedanib on the PK of cytarabine is unlikely. To date no publication has documented such an interaction effect when cytarabine is combined with other cytotoxics.

 1.15 Premature discontinuation of treatment  
 
The treatment may be discontinued prematurely for the following reasons:  
- toxicity,  
- disease progression,  
- refusal to continue the trial,  
- withdrawal of consent,  
- patient lost to follow up,  
- major protocol violation.  
Where possible, patients who have discontinued their treatment prematurely will receive the same

Unblinding will be considered for a specific patient  
1/ if he /she  is not achieving response after first cycle of treatment (crossover) or  
2/ in case of unexpected serious adverse event potentially related to the study drug.   In case of an 
unexpected serious adverse event potentially related to the study drug, the investigator will request 
the sponsor to unblind the study. In all case s and until the procedure of unblinding has been fully 
discussed and completed, the drug/placebo should be suspended. If the u nblinding is done , the 
patient will continue to be followed according to the protocol recommendations , including a 
potential premature discontinuation of treatment if appropriate.

 1.19 Serious Adverse events 
1.19.1  General definition  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any expected or unexpected harmful and unintended occurrence or exacerbation 
in a clinical trial subject, whether or not related to the trial or the investigational product. It can be a new 
intercurrent disease, exacerbation of a concomitant disease, an accident, or any other deterioration in the 
patient’s health, including abnormal laboratory findings.  All AEs will be reported from the time that conse nt 
is obtained.  
Any medical condition that existed before the start of the study treatment and that remains unchanged or 
improves must not be recorded as an AE. If a medical condition worsens, it must be recorded as an AE. The 
diagnosis or syndrome rather than the individual signs or symptoms must be recorded on the AE pages of 
the case report form.  
An event is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if it:  
 Results in death; Death due to disease progression is excluded  
 Is life -threatening,  
 Requires inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Cause any persistent or significant  disability / incapacity,  
 Causes a congenital anomaly, birth defect or abortion,  
 Is a new cancer (that is not the condition of the study)  
 Is associated with an overdose  
 Is another  medically significant  event  
 
The terms disability and incapacity  refer to any clinically significant physical or mental handicap, 
whether temporary or permanent, that affects the patient’s physical a ctivity and/or quality of life.  
A medically significant  event is any clinical event or laboratory finding considered by [CONTACT_827577]. It may pose a risk to the 
patient and require medical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes mentioned 
previously ( e.g. an overdose, second cancer, pregnancy, and new information can be considered 
medically significant). 
The following are not considered as serious adverse events:  
 Death due to disease progression  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] < 24 hours  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_827543]/or stipulated in the protocol (e.g. for 
biopsy or chemotherapy)  
 
The AE pages of the case report form and an SAE form should be completed for each AE considered serious.  
For each AE, the investigator shall provide information about the intensity, start and end dates, 
causality, the action taken, and the outcome  
 
Nintedanib AML V ersion  7 21 MAY 2019

 1.19.2  Definition of an expected serious adverse event 
(SAE -E) 
 
An expected SAE is an event already mentioned in the most recent version of the Investigator 
Brochure, or in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for medicinal products that have 
already been granted marketing authorization (MA). This definition also applies to the trial drug when 
it is administered for the same population but for an unlicensed indication.  
 
1.19.3  Definition of an unexpected serious adverse event 
(SAE -U) 
 
Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current 
investigator brochure; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational 
plan.  “Unexpected” as used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed (e.g., included in the investigator brochure) rather than from the perspective of 
such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical 
product.  [21CFR312.32(a)]  
1.19.4  Intensity  
 
The term intensity  (severity) should not be confused with the term seriousness that serves as a guide 
for defining reporting obligations.  
 
The intensity of events shall be evaluated according to the excerpt from the CTC -AE classification, 
version 4.0 (Appe ndix 7). The intensity of adverse events not listed in this classification will be rated 
using the following terms:  
Mild (grade 1): does not affect the patient’s usual daily activities  
Moderate (grade 2): interferes with the patient’s usual daily activitie s 
Severe (grade 3): prevents the patient’s usual daily activities  
Very severe (grade 4): requires intensive care / is life -threatening  
Death (grade 5)

 1.19.5  Causal relationship between an adverse event 
(SAE/AE) and the study treatment  
 
Assessment of attributio n is made by [CONTACT_827578], during, and 
after occurrence of the event, including diagnostic tests to assess the cause of the event.  Clinically 
relevant data include, but are not limited to; underlying disease, past  and present medical history (all 
concurrent non -malignant disease), concurrent medications, and timing between event and drug 
administration.  The mechanism of action and prior toxicology of the study drug should be considered.  
An adverse event is associated with the use of the drug when there is a reasonable possibility that 
the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]. [21CFR312.32(a)]  
Attribution Standards per NCI – CTEP:  
Unrelated  The Adverse Event is clearly not  related to the investigationa l agent (s)  
Unlikely  The Adverse Event is doubtfully  related to the investigational agent(s)  
Possible  The Adverse Event may be  related to the investigational agent(s)  
Probable  The Adverse Event is likely  related to the investigational agent(s)  
Definite  The Adverse Event is clearly  related to the investigational agent(s)

 For each event, the investigator shall complete the SAE reporting form provided at start- up. 
Additional information may be requested by [CONTACT_2037] (by [CONTACT_6791], post, telephone, or during a visit).  
Nevertheless, any event that qualifies as expected but differs in its intensity, clinical course, or 
frequency will be considered as an unexpected event by [CONTACT_827579].  
 
1.19.[ADDRESS_1148239]  
 
The following events are considered as Protocol -specified events of special interests:  
Any gastrointestinal - and non- gastrointestinal perforation, leakage, fistula formation, abscess  
• In such case s the following additional information needs to be collected, documented in the 
respective comment field of the CRF page and the respective narratives of the SAE  form and  
emailed or  faxed to the Yale Project Manager and  Sponsor  PI.  
•   Location of perforation, leakage, fistula, abscess  
• Location/exten t of abdominal tumor manifestations,  
• Imaging & reports (CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, pathology, etc.)  
• Prior surgery (location, wound healing complications)  
• Concomitant diseases with GI involvement (e.g., M Crohn, vasculitis, tuberculosis, 
diverticulitis)  
• Thromboembolic events (or predisposition)  
Drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by [CONTACT_827580] 
a protocol -specified adverse event of special interest (AESI). Timely detection, evaluation, and follow -
up of labor atory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to distinguish an effect of the 
investigational drug from other causes are important for patient safety and for the medical and scientific interpretation of the finding.  
The following are considere d as protocol -specified AESI:  
• An elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in the same 
blood draw sample  
• An elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.[ADDRESS_1148240] combined with an elevation of bilirubin to >1.[ADDRESS_1148241] been met.

 1.19.9  Reporting to Boehringer Ingelheim  
 
Upon inclusion into a trial, the patient’s condition is assessed (e.g. documentation of history / 
concomitant diagnoses and diseases), and relevant changes from baseline are noted subsequently.  
All adverse events, serious and non- serious, that occur from the time of signing the  informed consent 
through  [ADDRESS_1148242] Manager shall report all SAEs and non -serious AEs which are relevant to a reported 
SAE by [CONTACT_827582]:  
• within five (5) calendar days upon receipt of initial and follow -up SAEs containing at least one fatal 
or immediately life -threatening event;  
• within ten (10) calendar  days upon receipt of any other initial and follow -up SAEs.  
 
Boehringer Ingelh eim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
[ADDRESS_1148243]  [ZIP_CODE] Fax: 1 -203- 837- 4329 
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity, treatment 
required, outcome, seriousness, causal relationship and action taken with the investigational drug. The investigator will also determine the expectedness o f each AE based on the listed adverse event 
section of Boehringer Ingelheim’s (BI’s) Investigator Brochure for the Product.  
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the clinical trial has ended. However, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) that occurred after the patient has completed the clinical trial (including any protoc ol specified follow -up period/Residual effect 
period), it should be reported to the PM if investigator considers it as relevant to the study drug. The PM will report to BI as required.

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, Octobe r [ADDRESS_1148265], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  52nd W M A 
General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 200 0 53th W M A General  Assem bl y,  W ashi ngton 
2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added) 55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note 
of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  59th W M A General  Assem bl y,  Seoul ,  October 2008  
A. INTRODUCTION  
• The World Medica l Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on 
identifiable human material and data.  The Decl arati on i s i ntended to be read as a whol e and 
each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other 
relevant paragraphs.   
• Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other 
participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.   
• It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those 
who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this du ty.   
• The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when  providing medical care.”   
• Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human 
subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.   
• In medical research involving human subjects, the well -being of the individual research subject 
must take precedence over all other interests.   
• The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, acces sibility and quality.   
• In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.   
Nintedanib AML V ersion  7 21 MAY 2019

 • Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human subjects and 
protect their health and rights. Some research populations are particularly vulnerable and 
need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves  and those who m ay be vul nerabl e to coerci on or undue i nfl uence.     
• Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research 
 i nvol vi ng hum an subj ects i n thei r own countri es as wel l  as appl i cabl e i nternati onal  norm s and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any o f the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
  
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
• It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of 
research subjects.   
• Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.   
• Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the 
environment .   
• The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly 
described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this D eclaration have been 
addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional 
affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are  harmed as a consequence of participation in 
the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study access by 
[CONTACT_565145].   
• The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a 
research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take int o consideration 
the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse 
events. No change to the protocol may  be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_12924].   
• Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_565146]. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires  the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health 
Nintedanib AML V ersion  [ADDRESS_1148266] given consent.   
• Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is only justified 
if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this population or community and if the re is a reasonable likelihood that this population or community stands 
to benefit from the results of the research.   
• Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by [CONTACT_827589].  
 
• Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.  
• Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless they are 
confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily 
managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are found to outweigh 
the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.   
• Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the 
objective outw eighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects.   
• Participation by [CONTACT_827590]. 
Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no competent individua l may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.   
• Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on their physic al, mental and social integrity.  
• In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential subject must be 
adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the 
study or to withdraw co nsent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention 
should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to 
the methods used to deliver the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent mus t be formally 
documented and witnessed.   
• For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally seek 
consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or  impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a 
threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.   
Nintedanib AML V ersion  7 21 MAY 2019 
70 
  
• When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician 
or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by 
[CONTACT_827591]  
 
• For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent 
from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a rese arch study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research entails only minimal  risk and 
minimal burden.   
• When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to decisions 
about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the 
consent of the legally authorized representa tive. The potential subject’s dissent should be 
respected.  Research i nvol vi ng subj ects who are physi cal l y or m ental l y i ncapabl e of gi vi ng 
consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental 
condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research 
population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.   
• Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication of the 
results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting.  Negative and inconclusive as well as 
positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.   
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
• The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the extent that the  res earch is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the 
physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.   
• The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  • The 
use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no curre nt proven 
 intervention exists; or Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons 
the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
Nintedanib AML V ersion  7 21 MAY 2019 
71 
 • At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.   
• The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the 
research. The refu sal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never interfere with the patient- physician relationship.   
• In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been 
ineffective,  the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient 
or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviatin g suffering. Where 
possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

 1.25.5  Procedures for the follow -up of a potential DILI 
case in IIS with nintedanib 
 
Introduction 
 
Drug -induced liver injury  
Drug -induced liver injury (DILI) has been the most frequent single cause of safety -related 
drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years (e.g., iproniazid), continuing to the present 
(e.g., ticrynafen, benoxaprofen, bromfenac, troglitazone, nefazodone) . Accordingly, detection 
of drug -induced liver injury of an investigational compound has become an important aspect 
of patient´s safety guarding in drug development.  
 
The US -FDA has published a Guidance for Industry entitled, “Drug- Induced Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation” which outlines the detection, evaluation, follow -up and 
reporting of drug- induced liver injury in clinical trials. Drugs that have the potential for 
inducing severe liver injury may be identified by [CONTACT_356714] 
(10x-, 15xULN), or the combination of hepatocellular injury (aminotransferase elevation 
≥3xULN) and altered liver function (hyperbilirubinemia ≥2xULN) which is defined as potential 
“Hy´s law case” if not explained by [CONTACT_725398] (i.e., 
significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase, ALP, >2X ULN) or some other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis, concomitant use of other known hepatotoxic drugs). This constellation predicts a poor outcome and although very rare, these potential cases have to be well characterized as soon as being identified as other confounding 
conditions may be the cause.   
 
In further consideration of this FDA Guidance, any potential “Hy’s Law case” has to be 
reported in an expedited manner to the FDA (i.e., even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded) and be followed- up appropriately. The follow -up includes a 
detailed clinical evaluation and identification of possible alter native etiologies for the “Hy´s 
Law case” constellation such as concomitant diseases (e.g. Hepatitis B) and/or other 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_827555].

Although rare, a potential for drug- induced liver injury is under constant  surveillance by 
[CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ 
safety.  
 
The concept below has been worked out by [CONTACT_23347] (BI) in order to guard 
patient´s safety and to respond to regulatory requirements. It is the basis for all clinical studies and should be applied as appropriate.  
 
Definition  
The following changes in the laboratory values are considered to  be a protocol -specific 
significant adverse event for all patients with normal values for ALT/AST at baseline:  
  
- an elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in the 
same blood draw sample  
-  an elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.[ADDRESS_1148267] combined with an elevation of bilirubin to >1.[ADDRESS_1148268] been met  
 
For patients with elevated ALT/AST values at baseline special considerations apply, if they 
are eligible for inclusion into the trial, e.g. if liver metastasis are present and do not qualify as 
exclusion criterion. For those special cases the BI contact [CONTACT_356717].

 Procedures  
1. Protocol -specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner 
similar as Serious Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousness 
criteria and documented in the eCRF  
 
 
2. Replication of the following laboratory tests for confirmation within 48 hours:  
 
- AST, ALT,  
- bilirubin measurement (total and direct bilirubin)  
- Alkaline Phosphatase  
- Haptoglobin  
- Complete blood count and cell morphology  
- Reticulocyte count  
- CK 
- LDH 
The results of these repeated laboratory tests must be documented on the eCRF /CRF forms and reported immediately  via the SAE form to the Project Manager who 
will report it to BI. 
 
3. An evaluation of the patient within [ADDRESS_1148269] to but not limited to:  
 
- Abdominal ultrasound or clinically appropriate other imaging and 
investigations adequate to rule out biliary tract, pancreatic,  intra - or 
extrahepatic pathology, e.g. bile duct stones,  neoplasm, hepatic tumour involvement, biliary tract, pancreatic or intrahepatic pathology, vascular hepatic conditions such as portal vein thrombosis or right heart failure. 
These data need to be collected, documented in the respective field of the 
eCRF / CRF / additional documentation form, and the respective SAE form has to be updated and forwarded to BI  
 
- detailed history of current symptoms and concurrent diagnoses and medic al history  
 
- detailed history of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription 
medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations and eg steroids 
as concomittant suppportive treatment), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets detailed history of exposure to environmental 
chemical agents  
 
4. In case that both imaging and laboratory value did not unequivocally confirm 
cholestasis as the reason of ALT / AST increase, in particular if AP < 2x ULN,  
then please complete the following laborator y tests:  
 
- Clinical chemistry  
alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase (either plasma or red blood cell), 
albumin, PT or INR, CK, CK -MB, coeruloplasmin*, α -1 antitrypsin*, 
Nintedanib AML V ersion  7 21 MAY 2019 
78 
 transferrin, ferritin, amylase*, lipase*, fasting glucose*, cholesterol, 
triglycerides  
- Serology  
Hepatitis A (Anti -IgM, Anti -IgG), Hepatitis B (HbsAg, Anti -HBs, DNA), 
Hepatitis C (Anti- HCV, RNA if Anti- HCV positive), Hepatitis D (Anti- IgM, 
Anti-IgG)*, Hepatitis E (Anti -HEV, Anti -HEV IgM, RNA if Anti- HEV IgM 
positive)*, Anti -Smooth Muscle antibody (titer)*, Anti -nuclear antibody 
(titer)*, Anti -LKM (liver -kidney microsomes) antibody*, Anti -mitochondrial 
antibody*, Epstein Barr Virus (VCA IgG, VCA IgM), cytomegalovirus (IgG, IgM), herpes simplex virus (IgG, IgM), varicella (IgG, IgM), parvovirus (IgG, 
IgM)  
- Hormones,  
TSH*  
- Hematology  
Thrombocytes*, eosinophils*  
 *If clinically indicated and in case that additional investigations are needed 
(e.g immunocompromised patients.)  
 
5. Initiate close observation of all patients with elevated liver enzyme and bilirubin 
elevations by [CONTACT_36145], AST,bilirubin (with fractionation into total and 
direct) and AP at least weekly until the laboratory values return to normal or to the 
values as defined in the protocol.  
 
6. In case that transaminases and/or bilirubin increase despi[INVESTIGATOR_827556], more frequent intervals will be warranted.  
Depending on further laboratory changes, additional parameters identified e.g. by 
[CONTACT_827592]

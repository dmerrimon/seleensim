subjects with ulcerat ive colitis (UC) (Study IM011024 ) did notmeet prespecified efficacy 
endpo ints during induct ion (the first 12 weeks of treatment) at the BMS -986165 6 mgBID dos e.
Key addit ions and clarificat ions include:
Removedthe BMS -986165 6 mg BID treatm ent arm , withsubjec ts subsequently randomized 
in a 3:1 rati o to ei ther 12 mg BID (~37 subjects) or placebo BID (~13 subjects) treatment.
Clarified that subjects current ly receiving treatment in the BMS -986165 6 mg BID arm under 
the Ori ginal Protocol  or Protocol  Amendment 01 will  continue to receive BMS -986165 6 mg
BID treatment throughout the double -blind period.
Updat edprior UC medicat ion Inclusio n Criterion4)a) to Criterion 4)b) to requi re inadequate 
response, loss of response, or intolerance to a treatment course of [ADDRESS_434136] of 
care UC medications ; added Inclusio n Criterion 4)c) to require at least 1 prior treatm ent course 
of corti costeroi ds for UC ; and added corticosteroi ds (m ust have had 2 exposures separated by 
a corti costeroi d-free period)  to 
the list of these standard of care UC medications.
Added potential  inclusio n of subject s in the study who discont inue treatm ent with biologics 
due to inadequate funding (previously located in Appendix 5 ).
Added an enrollment target number ofsubjects

Short Title: Safety, Efficacy, and Biomarker Response of BMS-986165 in Subjec ts with 
Moderate to Severe Ulcerat iveColitis
Study Phase: 2
Study Rationale: Study  IM011127 is a Phase 2 rando mized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter study  designed to assess the safety  and tolerabilit y, efficacy, and bi omarker response 
ofBMS-986165 12 mgtwice daily  (BID) orally (PO) in subjects with moderate to severe 
ulcerat ive co litis (UC).
This study  is being conducted in the context of a  w ider clinical devel opment program of
BMS -986165 in inflammatory bowel  disease (IBD; Secti on3.1.5 ).Study  IM011023 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) assesses safety and efficacy of BMS -986165 6 mgBID and 3mg BID PO 
regimens compared with placebo in subjects with moderately  to severely active Crohn’s disease 
(CD). Study  IM011024 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) compares BMS -[ADDRESS_434147] ion (the first 12 weeks of treatm ent) at the 6mg BID dose. The placebo reference 
arm has also been included to manage bias in the reporting of safety data and the reporting of 
patient-reported outcom es (PROs), including the PRO components of the modified Mayo score
that contribute to the evaluat ion of disease activity-based Inclusi on Criteria and the primar y 
endpo int of this study .
BMS -986165 12 mg BID is being assessed in this study  for the foll owing reasons:
Protocol Amendment No.: 02

The goals of this study are to:
1.Estimate the efficacy of BMS -[ADDRESS_434149] instruments (eg, modified May o score) and novel  instrum ents specifically  designed 
for use in exploratory  studies (eg, UC-100; see 
Section
9.1.2 ).
2.Evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS -[ADDRESS_434150] been explored in healthy volunteers for up to 
14days (
Secti
on3.1.3 and IB5). 
 
 BMS
-986165 6 mgBID is current ly 
being explored in subjects with UC and CD (
Secti
on3.1.5 ). However, this study  is the first 
experience of BMS-986165 12 mg BID PO in subjects with UC. Consequent ly, this study  will 
carefully  assess the safety  and tolerabili ty of this regimen in this patient population. Addit ional 
safet y assessments will be incorporated into this study, based on experience at relevant dose levels 
in preceding studies. Multiple levels of study oversi ght will be provided by [CONTACT_349384] y data by [CONTACT_52880], independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) (Section 5.1.6 ).

3 INTRODUCTION
3.1 Background
Ulcerat ive colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that causes 
significant m orbidity, impact on qualit y of life, and healt hcare expenditure. Outcomes for patients 
with UC have improved significant ly over the last several  years due to better treatm ent strategi es 
and the emergence of highly targeted biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. However, significant therapeuti c 
challenges remain with this and other inflammatory bowel  diseases (IBDs). Current treatment  
regimens often fail, induce only a partial response, or are poorly tolerated. For example, studies 
with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) report that 10% to 30% of subjects do not respond to 
their first treatment and 23% to 46% of subjects lose their response over time.6Therefore, there is 
still an unmet need for novel, safe, well-tolerated, and o rally administered therapi [INVESTIGATOR_15128] a different  
mechanism o f action that can effect ively treat UC and modify the disease course.
Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is an intracellular kinas e involved in int erleukin (IL)-12, IL-23, and 
TypeI interferon (IFN) si gnaling.7TYK2 is a widely expressed, non receptor tyrosine kinase that 
catalyzes the phosphorylat ion of signal transducer and act ivator of transcripti on (STAT) proteins 
downstream o f the receptors for the IL -12p40 -containing cytokines IL -[ADDRESS_434169] been 
implicated in the pathophysi ology of multiple immune -mediated di seases including UC, Crohn’s 
disease (CD), psori asis, psori atic arthri tis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and
spondylo arthropathi es.
BMS -986165 is an orally administered, selective TYK2 inhibitor. A comprehensive in vit ro and 
in vivo characteri zation of BMS-986165 has been established and supports the devel opment of 
this compound in humans.11

3.1.1 Nonclinical Toxicology
The projected systemic exposure multiples presented in this section are expressed relative to  
 
  
 . 
These multiples were calculated as animal sex-combined mean AUC ÷ human sex-
combined mean AUC at the no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) or level associ ated with 
adverse findings in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_349362].
Protocol Amendment No.: 02
Date: 24-Feb-[ADDRESS_434170] low potential to produce effects in vivo  
related to secondary pharmaco logy. Transient decreases in blood pressure (BP) and increases in 
heart rate (HR) were seen in anesthet ized rabbi ts, and consci ous telemetri zed dogs and monkeys, 
with mo nkey being the most sensit ive species. However, the HR or BP changes were not ident ified 
in repeat -dose monkey toxicity studi es at higher doses or in healt hy subjects in a Phase [ADDRESS_434171] evaluated dose of 12mg BID or in the 
thorough QT (TQT) study  in healthy subjects up to a single dose of 36mg (Study  IM011048). 
Overall, the totali ty of available data indicate sthat BMS -986165 has low potenti al for off-target 
effects at clinical do ses and corresponding plasma concentrations.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that inhibit ion of TYK2 signaling by [CONTACT_20444] -986165 may be 
beneficial in pat ients with active UC.
In a cohort of healt hy humans, carriage of a naturally occurring protein variant in TYK2 (P1104A,

study .
The primary  endpoint of this study  is the proportion of subjects in clinical response at Week 12. 
This is assessed using the modified Mayo score. This instrument utilizes data from 2sources: 
(1)PRO 
s, 
ie, SF and RB captured by [CONTACT_349388] c daily diary (modified Mayo 
score and total Mayo score); and (2) Centrally -read endoscopic assessments (modified Mayo score 
and total Mayo score). In addition, the physician -reported PGA, assessed by [CONTACT_349389], will also be captured to facilitate the calculation o f the total and partia l 
Mayo scores. Efficacy will also be assessed using additional instrum ents, such as the UC-100 
instrum ent (which uses the modified Mayo score SF and ES subscores 
 
). Consequently, accurate and timely collecti

An endoscopy  (colonoscopy  or flexible sigm oidoscopy ) will be performed to determine if a subject 
has active intestinal inflammat ion (assessed by [CONTACT_18014]) and to obtain biopsies for 
biomarker  assessment. To avoid unnecessary endoscopi [INVESTIGATOR_014], best practi ce is to 
complete other screening invest igations first and check the resul ts of those invest igations to 
confirm ongoing eligibilit y before a subject begins bowel  preparat ion for endoscopy . Subjects 
must be randomized within 14 calendar days of the screening endoscopy .
NOTE: In the case of rescreening , the 14 -day w indow  to be randomized follow ing endoscopy may 
be extended an additional 3 days w ith approval of the BMS Medical Monitor/designee .

was not perform ed in the prior 12 months; or (2) in subjects who requi re a co lonoscopy  to screen 
or surveille for dysplasia, based on local guidelines; or (3) in subjects who require a colonoscopy 
to screen for colorectal carcino ma, based on local guidelines.
A full colonoscopy is encouraged if disease extent is unknown in order todefine the proximal

of continuing the study , with or wi thout study  modificati ons, or stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_10098] .
In addition to regularly scheduled DMC meet ings, ad hoc DMC meetings will occur in the 
following circumstances:
Two or m ore subjects experience an SAE of the same PTand that is considered related to the 
study  treatm ent by [CONTACT_3170] (for example, not explained by [CONTACT_349393])

6.5 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but who are 
not subsequent ly randomized in the study /included in the analysis popul ation. Aminimal set of 
screen failure informat ion is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to 
meet the Conso lidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requi rements, as 
applicable, and to respond to queries from regul atory  authori ties. Minimal informat ion includes 
date of  consent, dem ography , screen failure details, eligibili ty criteria, and any  SAEs. Addi tional 
screening data, such as SF, RB, and ES subscores; PGAs; fecal calprotectin; and other clinically 
relevant da ta may also be requi red.
6.5.1 Retesting During the Screening Period
For laboratory  parameters and/or assessments (
Section
2) that initially do not meet eligibilit y 
requi rements, a single retest wi thin the screening peri od m ay be permitted after consultation wit h 
the BMS Medical Moni tor/desi gnee. The invest igator shoul d have a reasonable expectati on that 
the retested l aboratory  parameter and/or assessment is likely to meet eligibilit y requirements.
Confirmatory  testing of parameters that require confi rmation per protocol  (eg, indeterminate or 
borderline  result) and repeat testing of laboratory  parameters that are unable to be reported 
(eg, due to an inadequate sample) can be performed without consultat ion with the BMS Medi cal 
Moni tor/desi gnee .
6.5.[ADDRESS_434228] who has been deemed as ineligible (a screen failure) 
during the screening period (ie, the subject has not been rando mized/has not been t reated). Subjects 
who wi sh to be rescreened shoul d be discussed with the BMS Medical Moni tor/desi gnee prior to 
rescreening. The subject must be re -consented and will be assigned a new ident ificat ion number, 
and a full screening visit must be performed again (unless individual screening invest igations can 
be waived, as discusse 
d 
below). The most current result prior to randomizat ion is the value by 
[CONTACT_349397] y will be assessed.
A subject can only be rescreened [ADDRESS_434229] fails 1 rescreening attem pt, no addi tional 
rescreening is allowed.
Protocol Amendment No.: 02
Date: 24-Feb-[ADDRESS_434230] to be repeated. Subjects who are likely to 
benefit from this approach shoul d be discussed wi th the BMS Medical  Monitor/desi gnee prior to 
rescreening.
In the case of rescreening after an initial eligible screening endoscopy, the SF and RB scores 
for eligibility w ill be based on the Day 1 vis it date rather than the bow el preparation date.
The window  between the initial screening endoscopy and randomization may be extended up 
to an additional 3 days w ith approval of the BMS Medical Monitor /designee .
Durati on of existing treatm ents and requi reddiscont inuat ion periods shall be considered relative 
to the successful screening visit and/or rando mizatio n.
Subjects who are diagnosed wit h C. difficile infect ion during screening may be rescreened 30 days 
after complet ion of an adequate course of treatment for C. difficile (ie, standard of care antibiot ics, 
fecal transplantati on, etc.) and subsequent negative testing for C. difficile stool  toxin and a 
C.difficile NAAT. Test resul ts should be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor/designee prior 
to rescreening .

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
At the time of the screening visi t, immediately after informed consent is obtained and before any 
study -related procedures are perform ed, the investigat ive site will access the interactive response 
techno logy (IRT) system for assignment of the subject numb er. This number will be unique across 
all sites. All subjects who sign the ICFwill be assigned sequential  subject numbers. The subject 
number may not be used for any other subject. If a potential subject is rescreened, they will be 
given a new subject num ber.
Eligible subjects will be centrally randomized using IRT at a 3:[ADDRESS_434240] acebo BID, 
according to a computer -generated block rando mization scheme. Rando mizat ion numbers will be 
assigned prior to dosing.
Before the study is initiated, each user (at invest igative sites) will receive log-in information and 
directions on how to access the IRT. Study treatment will be dispensed at study visits as shown in
the Schedule of Act ivities (
Secti
on
2).
7.3 Blinding
7.3.1 Maintaining the Blind
Blinded treatment assignments will be managed using IRT.
Each BMS -986165 tablet (12mg and 6mg) has an ident ical matching placebo tablet in order to 
maintain the blind. Tablets will be supplied in blister cards (see Section 7.1). Invest igative site 
staff, Sponsor and designee personnel, and subjects and their families will remain blinded to 
treatm ent assi gnments.
Protocol Amendment No.: 02
Date: 24-Feb-[ADDRESS_434241] (see 
 Section
5.1.6 ). 
DMC processes and procedures will be outlined in the DMC Charter.
Designated staff of BMS may be unblinded (obtain the rando mization codes) prior to database 
lock to f acilitate the bi oanal ytical analysis of 
  sam
ples and immunogenicit y. A 
bioanalyt ical scient ist in the Bioanaly tical Sciences department of BMS (or a designee in the 
external central  bioanaly tical laboratory ) may be unblinded to the rando mized treatm ent 
assignme nts in order to minimize unnecessary  bioanaly tical analysis o f samples.
7.3.[ADDRESS_434242]’s management, the blind for that subject may be broken by [CONTACT_3170]. 
The subject’s safet y takes priorit y over any other considerat ions in determining if a treatm ent 
assignment sho uld be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatm ent, the invest igator should determine 
that the unblinded information is necessary, ie, that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
management. In many cases, parti cularly  when the emergency is clearly  not rel ated to the IP, the 
probl em may be properly managed by [CONTACT_180806]. It is 
highly  desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment be discussed with the BMS 
Medical Moni tor/de signee, but the invest igator always has ultimate authorit y for the decision to 
unblind. The actual  TASK of unblinding can be delegated by [CONTACT_43073] a designee 
assigned the task on the Delegat ion of Authorit y. The principal invest igator or appoint ed designee 
shoul d only  call in for emergency  unblinding AFTER the decisio n to unblind the subject has been 
docum ented.
In case of an emergency, the invest igator has unrestricted access to randomization informat ion via 
IRT and i s capable of breaking the blind through the IRT sy stem  without pri or approval  from the 
Sponsor. After the unblinding via IRT, the investigator shall notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee and/or study director. The method of unblinding for emergency purposes is 
described in the IRT manual . Subject and unblinded treatm ent informat ion and the reason for the 
blind being broken, must be recorded on the appropriate study  status page of the eCRF.
In cases of accidental  unblinding, contact [CONTACT_349398]/desi gnee and ensure every
attem pt is made to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a subject for nonemergency purposes 
must be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor/designee.
7.4 Dosage Modification
There i s no provi sion for dose m odificat ion of study treatment.
Dose stabilizat ion criteria for permitted UC treatments are detailed in Secti on0(Table 8).
Modificat ion of permitted UCtreatm ents or dose regimens is allowed for safet y reasons, or if a 
Protocol Amendment No.: 02
Date: 24-Feb-[ADDRESS_434243] experiences an AE attributable to that treatm ent. Subjects shoul d continue to take their 
assigned treatm ent even if their clinical condi tion worsens (ie, they experience a “flare”), unless 
any o f the criteria in Section 8.1are met. If a subject’s clinical condit ion worsens before Week [ADDRESS_434244] igator’s 
judgment, the subject must discont inue study  treatm ent (IP or placebo) in favor of appropri ate 
alternative available treatment.
See Secti on8.1.1 for information regarding temporary  interrupti on of  study  treatm ent.
7.5 Preparation/Handling/ Storage/Accountability
The IP should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibilit y of 
the invest igator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study  subjects. The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study  sites by a uthori zed personnel according to local regulat ions.
The product storage manager shoul d ensure that th e study  treatm ent is stored in accordance with 
the environmental condi tions (temperature, light, and humidit y) as determined by [CONTACT_20444]. If 
concerns regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study  treatm ent arise, the study treatm ent 
shoul d not be di spensed and BMS should be contact[CONTACT_15608] .
Study  treatm ent not supplied by  [CONTACT_53972].
IP documentation (whether supplied by [CONTACT_20447]) must be maintained that includes all processes 
requi red to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes docum entati on of drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconst itution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
Further guidance and informat ion for final dispositi on of unused study  treatm ent are provided in

7.6 Treatment Compliance
Study  treatm ent compliance will be monitored as indicated in the Schedule of Activities 
(Secti on2) using standard drug accountabilit y procedures (comparing the number of tablets 
returned to number dispensed, considering the expected regimen and any  reported missed doses). 
Drug accountabilit y will be reviewed by [CONTACT_349399] m

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activit ies (Secti on2). Waivers or 
exempt ions from protocol -requi red evaluat ions are not allowed.
All immediate safet y concerns must be discussed with the BMS Medical Moni tor/desi gnee 
immediately  upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject should continue or 
discontinue treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities 
(Secti on2), is essent ial and requi red for study  conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be co mpleted and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet 
all eligibilit y criteria before rando mizat ion. The investigator will m aintain a screening log to record 
details o f all subjects screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management (eg, complete blood 
count) and o btained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening purposes provided the 
procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and this approach has been discussed and agreed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor/designee ( Section2). A CXR perform ed less than [ADDRESS_434256] has no 
symptoms or signs suggestive of pulmo nary disease in the interim.
Assessments at the randomizat ion visit (Day 1) must be perform ed per protocol . Standard of care

9.1.1 Capturing Data to Assess Disease Activity and Determine Efficacy
Subject’s Electronic Daily Diary : An electroni c diary  will be provi ded to each subject for 
daily  recording of SFand RBdata. Baseline SF (either reference remissio n SF or pre -UC SF; 
see Mayo score, below) and health -related quality of life (Inflammatory  Bowel  Disease 
Quest ionnair e [IBDQ ]) will also be captured in the electronic diary at the timepo ints indicated 
in the Schedule of Act ivities (
Section
2).
Data deri ved from the electroni c daily diary  are used f or assessment of Inclusio n Criteriaand 
outcom e measures. Subjects will be trained on the use of the el ectroni c diary at the screening 
visit. Sites shoul d periodically assess subject compliance with the electronic daily diary. 
Shoul d the subject miss daily entries prior to a study visit, the invest igator should assess if the 
visit shoul d be rescheduled to ensure that an adequate number of daily entries for efficac y 
assessment are recorded.

9.6.1 Additional Research Collection
This protocol will include residual sample storage for addit ional research (see Table 15).
For All sites:
Addit ional research is required for all study parti cipants, except where prohibi ted by [CONTACT_1202]/ethics 
committees, prohibit ed by [CONTACT_349411], or academic/inst itutional requi rements. Where 
one or more of these except ions occurs, participation in the addit ional research will not be a 
condi tion of  overall study  parti cipat ion.
If the IRB/ethics committees and site agree to the mandatory  additional research retenti on 
and/or collection, then the study  participant must agree to th e mandatory  additional research 
as a requi rement for inclusi on in the study .
If optional parti cipat ion is permitted and approved, then the stud y participants m ay opt out of 
the addi tional research retent ion and/or collect ion.
Addit ional research is intended to expand the research and development capabilit y at 
BristolMyers Squibb, and will support as yet undefined research aims that will advance our 
understanding of disease and options for treatment. This may also include genetic/geno mic 
explorat ion aimed at exploring disease pathways, progression , and response to treatm ent etc.
Sample Collection and Storage
All requests for access to sam ples or data for addi tional research will be vetted through a diverse 
committee of the study  Sponsor’s senior leaders in Research and Devel opment (or designee) to 
ensure the research supports appropriate and well -defined scient ific research activit ies.

Samples kept for future research will  be stored at the BMS Bi oreposi tory in 
  [LOCATION_003] or 
an independe nt, BMS -approved storage vendor.
The manager of  these samples will  ensure they  are properly  used throughout thei r usable life and 
will destroy  the samples at the end of  the scheduled storage peri od, no l onger than [ADDRESS_434283] to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination
Approximately  50subjects will be rando mized in a 3:1 ratio to BMS ‑986165 12mg BID or
placeboBID, respectively  (ie, approximately  37subjects receiving BMS ‑986165 12 mg BID and 
approximately  13subjects receiving placebo BID). Subjects randomized to BMS -[ADDRESS_434292] s are expected to be 
rando mized to the BMS -986165 6 mg BID dose arm.
 
 
 
10.1.1 Clinical Response Rate
The assumed rate of clinical response at Week 12 is based on the observed rates of clinical 
respo nse in recent clinical trials of mirikizumab (an anti–IL-23p19 antibody; Week 12 endpo int, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED])31and ustekinumab (an anti–IL-12p40 antibody; Week 8 endpo int, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).1
Assuming BMS ‑986165 12 mg BID will  provide a similar clinical  response rate as was observed 
in these UC tri als, the expected clinical  response rat e is assumed to be approximately  60%. If  the 
observed clinical response rate in this study  is the same as the assumed rate reported above, the 
estimated 95% CI of clinical response rate is expected to be (42%, 75%) for the BMS ‑[ADDRESS_434293] method.
With the sample size selected for this study , the expected 95% CI of clinical response rate for the 
BMS ‑986165 12mg BID arm will exclude a placebo rate of  33% (95% CI: 29%, 37%) reported 
in a recent m eta-analysis of clinical trials in UC.56
10.1.2 Adverse Event Incidence
Administrati on of BMS‑986165 12mg BID t o 37subjects provi des a 98% probabilit y of observing 
at least 1 occurrence of any  AE that occurs wi th 10% incidence in the popul ation from which the 
sample is drawn. However, if the incidence rate is 6%, the probabilit y of observi ng at least 
1occurrence of that AE with a sample size of 37subjects is 90%.

10.4 Statistical Analyses
The SAP will bedeveloped and finalized before the database lock for the primary analysis or 
interim analysis (if applicable) and will describe the selection of subjects to be included in the 
analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.
Categorical data will be summarized as frequency counts and percentages. Continuous data will 
be summarized using n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum unless otherwise specified.
During the treatment period, data will be presented for the following t reatm ents:
BMS -986165 12 mg BID
BMS -986165 6 mg BID
Placebo
10.4.[ADDRESS_434294] dose of 
study  drug unless otherwise indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint
Analysis Method :
The proporti on of  subjects achieving clinical response at Week 12 and the associated 95% CI for 
theBMS -[ADDRESS_434295] 
method. Supportive analysis using logistic regressio n for the clinical response (binary  endpo int) 
may be performed, and the odds ratio between treatm ent groups and the corresponding 95% CI 
may be provided if the data are sufficient to do so.
Imputation Method:
Occurrence o f intercurrent events may have an impact on the estimand of interest for the following 
types of subjects: (1) subjects who discont inue treatm ent or study  early (ie, prior to Week 12); 
(2)subjects who start a protocol prohibi ted medication/therapy; or (3) subjects who are lost to 
follow-up or have otherwise missing endpo int data at or prior to the Week 12 assessment . In these 
cases, the primary endpo int will be determined using the “Composite Strategy ” as defined in the 
International Council for Harmonisat ion (ICH) E9 (R1) addendum and will be considered a 
measure of nonresponse to treatment.58Subjects with the identified intercurrent event(s) will have 
their clinical  response endpoint imputed as being a “nonresponder.” This is commo nly known as 
nonresponder imputation.
Sensit ivity analyses using different imputati on methods may be performed and will be defined in 
the SAP.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An AE is defin ed as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a  preexisting 
medical condi tion in a clinical invest igation participant administered study  drug and that does 
not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore beany unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or di sease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of  study  drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al labora tory test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scient ific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermi ttent pre exist ingcondi tion including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervent ion 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_3170]), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardl ess of sequelae and 
shoul d specify “inte ntional overdose” as the verbatim term. 
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Definition of SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event Definition: Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the parti cipant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_349376] (see note 
below)
Note: The fo llowing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_349377]:
a visit to the emergency room  or other hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53914] < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event).
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent .
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure .
routi ne healt h assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routi ne colonoscopy ).
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appr opriate docum entati on is requi red in these cases.
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], famil y circumstances, administrative reason).
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s).
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or permanent dam age
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participan t,or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above). Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689]. Potenti al drug-induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event (see Section 9.2.7 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI).
Pregnancy and potential DILI must follow the same transmissio n timing and processes to BMS as 
used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies).
Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (eg, death is an endp oint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).

EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Intensity
The intensit y of AEs is determined by  a physician and will use the following levels:
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal disco mfort, and not 
interfering wi th everyday act ivities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficient disco mfort and interferes with normal  everyday 
activit ies.
Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activit ies. An AE that is assessed as severe 
shoul d not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for rating the intensit y of 
an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE. A “reasonable possibilit y of a rel ationship” conveys that there 
are facts, evidences, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship rather than a 
relationship cannot be ruled out.
The inves tigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administratio n 
will be consi dered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the I Band/or Product Information, for marketed products, 
in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and h as provi ded an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assess ment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited inform ation is initially available, follow -up reports are requi red. Note: Follow -
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or rel ationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, the SAE report m ust be updated and submi tted wi thin 24 hours to BMS (or 
designee) us ing the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs and nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discont inuat ion of study treatment must 
be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
Appendix 4 provi des general  information and defini tions related to Woman of Childbearing 
Potenti al (WOCBP) and methods of contraception that can be applied to most clinical  trials. For 
inform ation specific to this s tudy regarding acceptable contraception requirements for female and 
m
ale participants, 
 refer to 
 Section 
6.1of the protocol. Only the contraception methods as described 
in
 Section 
6.1are 
acceptable for this study
.

EFINITIONS
WOCBP
A wom an is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming postm enopausal  unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Premenarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
oDocum ented hysterectomy
oDocum ented bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_349378]: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical records, 
medical ex aminat ion, or m edical history  interview.
 
  
 
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed 
 
levels and may requi re a washout peri od to obtain a physi ologic 
 
level. The 
durati on of the washout period is a funct ion of the type o f HRT used. The duration o f the washout 
period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their judgment in checking 
serum   levels.
1-week minimum for vaginal horm onal products (rings, creams, gels)
4-week minimum for transdermal products
8-week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  
 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time durin g the washout period, the wom an can be consi dered 
.

safet y margins from the no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) or the time requi red for 
5half-lives of the IMP to pas s.
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
Local  laws and regulat ions may require use of alternat ive and/or addit ional contraception methods.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User -Dependent
Failure rate of < 1% per year w hen used consistently and correctly.a
Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) horm onal contracepti on associ ated with 
inhibit ion of ovulation and/or implantati on (This method of contraception can only be used 
by [CONTACT_349421] )b
oOral (birth control  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353])
oIntravaginal (rings)
oTransdermal
Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) horm onal contracepti on must begin at

Vasectomized partner
Having a vasectomized partner is a highly effect ive contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual  partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an addit ional highly  effect ive method of contraception should be us ed.
Sexual abst inence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs tobe evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
Continuous abstinence must begin at least 30 days prior to init iation of study  therapy .
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraceptio n when complete abstinence is 
elected.
WOCBP subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy  tests, 
as specified in Secti on2.
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WO CBP subjects chooses to forego complete abst inence.
Periodic abstinence (including but not limited to calendar, symptothermal, postovulation
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactati onal amenorrhoea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study .
NOTES:
aTypi[INVESTIGATOR_349379]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for subjects participating in clinical studies.
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficac y of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medicatio ns will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased expos ures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of 
hormonal contraception, refer to Section 6.1INCLUSION CRITERIA and Section 7.7.1 PROHIBITED 
AND/OR RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.
cIUSs are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone 
exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness . For information specific to this 
study regarding permissibility of hormonal contraception, refer to Section 6.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA and 
Section 7.7.1 PROHIBITED AND/OR RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.

APPENDIX 9 MAYO SCORE: COMPONEN T SUBSCORES AND ELEC TRONIC 
SUBJECT DIARY ENTRY INSTRUCTIONS
The Mayo score is a composite instrument designed to assess ulcerative colitis (UC) disease 
activit y. It includes pat ient-reported outcomes (PROs), an object ive assessment of disease activit y 
by [CONTACT_235127] , and a Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA). The Mayo score was first proposed 
by [CONTACT_349425].47Scherl et al48proposed that th e May o score shoul d be m odified by [CONTACT_349426] 
“mild friabilit y” from the definit ion of an endoscopi c (ES) subscore =1. This was supported by 
[CONTACT_349427] (FDA) that states the presence of 
friabilit y is not consistent with the concept of “clinical remissio n” (Lines 249 -251).38As the PGA 
is neither a PRO nor an object ive assessment of disease activity, and the concept that it purports 
to measure i s not di stinct fro m the other components of the modified Mayo score, use of the PGA 
as a component of the modified Mayo score is no longer recommended by [INVESTIGATOR_28936]38or European 
regul atory  authori ties.39
Consequent ly, disease activity assessments for inclusion and efficacy assessment will use the 
9-point m odified May o score (ie, excludin g PGA). The PGA will  continue to be captured as part 
of this study  to facilitate the cal culat ion of the total May o score, whi ch will allow these data to be 
compared wi th previ ous clinical  trials.
Table 1outlines the components and scoring used to calculate the modified and total Mayo scores.

PGA =Physician’s Global Assess ment
aEach subject serves as his or her own control to establish the degree of abnormality of the SF.
bThe daily  bleeding score represents the most severe bleeding of the day.
cThe original description of the Mayo score included “mild friability” in an ES subscore =1. The modified Mayo 
score removed friability from an ES subscore =0.
dThe PGA acknowledges the patient’s SF, RB, and endoscopy reports; the patient’s daily record of abdominal 
discomfort and general sense of well-being; and other observati ons, such as physical findings and the patient’s 
performance status.
MAYO SCORES: DEFINITIONS
Two different versio ns of the Mayo score will be used as efficacy endpo ints:
Modified Mayo Score : The modified Mayo score is a 9-point scale ; a score of 5  to 9 p oints 
(inclusive), which is requi red for randomizat ion, denotes m oderate to severe disease (by  [CONTACT_349428]). The m odified Mayo score is an adaptation of the total Mayo score (defined below) that 
excludes the PGA subscore.
The m odified May o score in corporates the following 3 components :
Stool  frequency  (SF) subscore (0 to 3)
Rectal  bleeding (RB) subscore (0 to 3)
ESsubscore (0 to 3)
Total Mayo Score : The original  total  Mayo score incorporates all 4 components of UC severit y 
listed in Table 1; each co mponent subscore ranges fro m 0 to 3. The total Mayo score is a 12-point 
scale in which a higher score equals more severe disease .
The modified and total Mayo scores will be calculated using co mponent subscores entered into the 
electroni c case report form (eCRF).

MAYO SCORES: SF AND RB COMPONENT SUBSCORES
SF and RB data will be recorded and calculated using an electronic subject diary.
Stool Frequency and Rectal Bleeding Subscores
Subjects will enter SF and RB data into the el ectroni c subject diari es on a daily basis throughout 
their participat ion in the study . Instructi ons for recording the number of stools and worst rectal 
bleed ing and definit ions of SF and RB are provided in Table 2.
NOTE : The subject daily  diary inform ation should be reviewed prior to each scheduled visit at 
which Mayo scores are to be calculated and during each study  visit to ensure that subjects are 
successfully entering and uploading diary data. If adequate entries have not been made, the subject 
shoul d be counseled about proper study  procedures.
For eligibilit y and efficacy  analysis purposes, the [ADDRESS_434318] recent (not necessarily consecutive), 
valid, electronic subject diary entries recorded from the 7 days prior to a study visit will be 
used to calculate the SF and RB subscores. For study  visits that include an endoscopy  (eg, 
screening, Weeks 12, 52 and ET or unscheduled visit [if applicable]), the [ADDRESS_434319] recent (not 
necessarily consecutive), valid, electronic subject diary entri es recorded from the [ADDRESS_434320] been recorded in the 
7 day  window described above, the m odified Mayo score cannot be cal culated for that timepoint.
The SF and RB values used to establish eligibilit y will also be used for calculat ion of the baseline 
modified May o score.
The following will be considered invalid data and excluded fro m SF and RB s ubscore calculat ions:
A day  that m edicat ion(s) for constipat ion, diarrhea, or bowel irregularit y are taken
Formal calculat ion of SF and RB subscores will be performed using the electronic subject diaries.
For the pre endoscopy screening visit (ie, prior to the availabilit y of electroni c subject di ary data) :
The baseline SF will be determined based on the number of stools a subject has in a 24 -hour period 
when in remissi on from UC symptoms; orif a subject has notbeen in remissi on, they should be 
asked to id entify the number o f stools they had in a 24 -hour period before init ial onset of signs and 
symptoms of UC ( Table 2).
This baseline SF is used as the r eference for subsequent SF subscores.
For the endoscopy  screening visit:
Best practice is to complete the other screening investigations first and check results to ensure that 
a subject continues to be potentially eligible for the study prior to commencing bowel  preparati on 
for the endoscopy .When the endoscopy  is scheduled, SF and RB data in the electroni c subject 
diary from the 7 day s prior to the bowel preparation day for the endoscopy will be evaluated to 
ensure eligibilit y is maintained.
Following endo scopy , the ES subscore will be received via email fro m the central reader  
 . 
This centrally -read screening ES subscore will be entered into the eCRF, in

Worst Rectal Bleeding (for the Mayo Scores) (Each Over a 24-hour 
Period)
Completion of electronic subject diarySubjects will be trained on the completion of the electronic 
subject diary.
SF
Definitio n of stoolA stool is defined as a trip to the toilet when the subject has 
either a bowel movement or passes blood alone, blood and 
mucus, o r mucus only.
Determine baseline SF 
(over 24 hours)At the screening visit, the number of stools the subject has in a 
24-hour period when in remission from UC symptoms or prior to 
diagnosis of UC should be asked by [CONTACT_3899] e and entered in the 
electronic patient diary.
If the subject has not been in remission, then the subject should 
be asked to identify the number of stools he/she had in a [ADDRESS_434325] diary on a daily basis. 
Subjects should make diary entries at the same time each day.

Period)
Completion of electronic subject diarySubjects will be trained on the completion of the electronic 
subject diary.
NOTE: For eligibility and efficacy analysis purposes, the 
established baseline SF (defined above) will be used to calculate 
the number of stools ab ove normal and subsequently assign a 
Mayo SF component score. This will be done automatically by 
[CONTACT_349429]. 
RB
Most severe category of RB 
(in a given 24 -hour period)Subjects should enter into the electronic subject diary the most 
severe category that describes the amount of blood they had in 
their stools for that given day.
Categories (subscore) of RB are defined as follows:
No blood seen (0)
Streaks of blood with stool less t han half the time (1)
Obvious blood (more than just streaks) or streaks of blood 
with stool most of the time (2)
Blood alone passed (3)
Subjects should enter “No Blood Seen” in the RB section if they 
do not have stool during a given day. 
Recording of RB assessmentsSubjects are to record their RB assessments in the electronic 
subject diary on a daily basis. Subjects should make diary entries 
at the same time each day.
RB=rectal bleeding; SF =stool frequency; UC = ulcerative colitis

ESSubscore
ES subscores will be provided via email  by [CONTACT_349430] y and efficacy  assessments, at all time points. The endoscopy 
procedure from screening (central  read) will be used to determine the baseline ES subscore 
component of the Mayo score. The ES subscores of the Mayo score will be modified so that the 
value [ADDRESS_434326] igator will provide the PGA at every required visit. Categories of the PGA are listed in

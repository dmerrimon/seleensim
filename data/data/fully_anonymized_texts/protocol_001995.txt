the detection of lung lesions. Digital tomosynthesis is an imaging modality that produces 3D sectional information using x-ray projections acquired over a limited scanning angle.  Scatter is known to be the primary source of image degradation in x-ray based imaging.   We have developed an approach that measures scatter through a low dose (3% of the conventional scan) scatter measurement technique. Preliminary studies have shown that scatter reduction in DCT can significantly improve quality.  We plan to characterize the reader confiden ce in lung nodule detection in our scatter corrected chest tomosynthesis 
imaging approach as compared to our conventional chest tomosynthesis.   Fifty (50) patients who have undergone a clinical non-contrast CT with lung nodules will be asked to have an s -DCT (scan) within 4 weeks (+/ - 2 week) of their clinical CT with 
no intervening procedures or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e. biopsy of lung nodules). We will then perform a reader study to evaluate the radiologist reader confidence in images generated from the scatter re duction technique versus more conventional chest tomosynthesis 
imaging. 
1.[ADDRESS_95090] based National Lung Screening Trial was published in 2011, and demonstrated that there was an overall 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in the low dose CT screening group in patients at high risk of lung cancer as compared to conventional radiographs.  Low dose CT was estimated to provide 1.[ADDRESS_95091] tomosynthesis (DCT) is a three -dimensional imaging technique that 
provides reconstruction planes from a limited- angle series of projection images. Clinical 
tomosynthesis applications include chest imaging [ 3-10], angiography [ 11],
 joints 
imaging [ 12], dental imaging [ 13 ], and breast imaging[ 3, 14, 15]. Compared to 
conventional chest radiography, DCT results in improved visibility of normal structures 
such as vessels, airway and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. By [CONTACT_87213], it also enhances detection of small lung nodules [2]. DCT has better resolution 
than CT in the plane of the image (but worse resolution in the depth direction) at a 
significantly lower radiation dose and cost [ 2].   In the current commercial systems, the 
projection image s are collected by [CONTACT_87214] a single x -ray source to different

CLINICAL ONCOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM    February [ADDRESS_95092] systems are currently commercially 
available, the GE VolumeRAD and Shimadzu RADspeed. In the GE VolumeRAD [ 16,

projections over 30° in [ADDRESS_95093] radiography (CR). In terms of diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy DCT is significantly better than CR, and is approaching that of CT. The reported effectiveness, as measured by [INVESTIGATOR_67124], of the GE system, as measured by [CONTACT_61106] (Area under Curve) using CT as the gold standard, varies from 0.73 to 0.96. [ 1] [18] [ 19]. The reported variation in AUC is 
partially attributed to patient motion during the scan. A recent study by [CONTACT_87215][INVESTIGATOR_87200], the detection performance of DCT for nodules (4–10 mm) is significantly better than that of CR; whereas there is not a significant difference in cases with motion artifacts. Using the Shimadzu RADspeed, which has a scanning time of 5s, Yamada et al reported AUC as high as 0.93 [ 20]. These 
results indicate that reducing image blurring due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_87201]. Patients with diseases of the lung, such as COPD or emphysema are severely compromised in their ability to hold their breaths for an extended period of time and consistently on command. Because of the long travel distance (~1m), heavy weight of the x-ray generator, and the precision required, further reduction of the scanning time is difficult even if the x -ray source can produce sufficient 
flux.

system the imaging dose for a full tomosynthesis scan is expected to be only 10% of that from a low -dose CT, and half of a conventional tomosynthesis scan. Beyond lung cancer 
screening, the low-dose and sensitive 3D lung imaging modality will likely to find applications in areas such as monitoring of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients where reduction of imaging dose is critical.   The proposed study is a close collaboration between 2 clinical researchers (Lee, MD/PhD, Ertan Pamkular, MD) utilizing the technology invented by [CONTACT_87216] (Otto Zhou, PhD, and Jianpi[INVESTIGATOR_87202], PhD) at UNC. It leverages the resources from several ongoing R&D programs in our lab on new imaging and radiotherapy devices based on the CNT x -ray source array technology, including the stationary digital breast

7 4.3 Study Procedures  
4.3.1 Enrollment/Recruitment  
We will review upcoming clinical chest CT studies for lung nodule follow-up.  We will 
ask patients to participate in this study to evaluate the utility of the scatter reduction approach for stationary digital chest tomosynthesis (s-DCT) machine, using the standard of care chest CT for comparison.   Once a pati ent has been identified, or we have collaborated with the treating clinic 
regarding the eligibility of a subject, the patient will be approached by a coordinator from Radiology to assess interest in participation. The coordinator will either go to the treating clinic, or will call the patient at home.   If the patient is interested in participation, he/she will be consented either then (in their treatment clinic) or when he/she arrives to have his/her s -DCT, but prior to any study 
procedures. Review of the consent will take place in the privacy of an exam room, or when possible, a sample consent will be sent to the patient via email prior to arriving for the scan to allow for ample review.  
4.3.2 Research Imaging  
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Procedures  
The study scan, s-DCT and correction scan, will be performed within two weeks of his/her clinical evaluations by [CONTACT_87218] x-ray. The study scan may be done within [ADDRESS_95099] of care imaging. There cannot be any intervening therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] (i.e. biopsy or excision of lesions) done in between the SOC imaging and the s- DCT.  
 All patients will have a breath held s -DCT scan in an anterior -posterior direction. Images 
will be reconstructed off-line and transferred for review on conventional PACS workstations. Images will be reviewed by [CONTACT_87219]. 
4.3.[ADDRESS_95100] images in a paired reader study. The radiologists will be presented with deidentified images from one modality (either with or without PSSC correction), then asked to identify the lesion and then determine a likelihood of malignancy based on the overall image set.  A likelihood of malignancy score (1 to 10) will be initially assigned by [CONTACT_73700]. The reader will then be given the deidentified images from the second modality, and their relative confidence in interpretation of the first modality as compared to the second will be evaluated on a [ADDRESS_95101] to assess for the presence of a nodule and will be interpreted by [CONTACT_87217].

5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
5.1 Investigational Device Description  
We recently demonstrated a high-speed, and low-dose stationary  digital tomosynthesis 
system (s-DCT) for 3D lung imaging[ 21].   The system is based on the carbon nanotube 
(CNT) x -ray source array technology invented by [CONTACT_87220][ 22-24]. Instead of 
mechanically moving a large x-generator to different viewing angles for the projection images, s -DCT generates the images by [CONTACT_87221] x-ray sources inside spati ally distributed CNT x -ray source array without 
moving the source, detector or the patient.  Our initial trial of lung nodule detection resulted in mixed results, with reasonable, but not sufficiently accurate identification of smaller lung nodules. One of the critical limitations is the reduction in image quality due to x-ray scatter, inherent in all x -ray based imaging systems.  
 
As shown in Figure 1, the clinical test ready prototype device has already been 
constructed by [CONTACT_87222] a commercial mobile  digital radiography system with a 
dedicated CNT x -ray source array (XinRay Systems Inc., NC).  A flat panel detector 
(Varian Inc., CA) is placed underneath the patient. An external collimator is connected to 
the source array to confine the x -ray radiation  only to the region of interests to minimize 
the radiation to the patient and the staff.

system with a CNT x -ray source array.  
 
In all x -ray imaging approaches, the detector measures both the photons that have passed 
directly through an object (primary photons) and those that are scattered by [CONTACT_87223] (scattered photons). Unfortunately, only the primary photons are useful for imaging in conventional diagnostic imaging. The presence of scattered photons is a major source of image degradation and extra dose to the patient. Scatter also increases as the imaging subject thickness increases. The scatter -to-primary ratio (SPR) in mammography can 
vary from 30% to 150%. In chest radiography the SPR can vary from 100% to 500%. Conventional radiography systems use anti-scatter grids placed in front of the detector to block some of the scattered photons from reaching the detector. Unfortunately, the grids also block significant portion of primary beam, and thus a large increase in dose (up to 500%) is required to obtain the same exposure to the detector. Analytical approaches to reduce scatter, such as Monte Carlo simulations and using peripheral field for modeling are generally time cons uming and inaccurate. The slot-scan method, though effective, is 
very slow and impractical for clinical applications.  
  
We have extended our system by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a scatter correction technique that can be applied to all of x-ray imaging, but is particularly useful in tomosynthesis scanning. Our approach is to estimate scatter by [CONTACT_1299] a large plate with holes that allow a small fraction (3%) of the primary beam to pass, which generates a patient specific scatter map. This scatter map can then be subtract ed from the diagnostic scan. 
 
Preliminary thoracic phantom and large animal imaging results have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach (Figure 2). Furthermore, by [CONTACT_87224], we

6.0 UNANTICIPATED CONCERNS  (DEVICES)  
6.1.[ADDRESS_95103] (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
6.1.2 Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects refers to any in cident, experience, or outcome that: 
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent 
document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.

13 7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a nonrandomized, single-center, observational study.  The purpose and 
endpoint of this study is to compare, in a radiologist reader study, the reader preference of the s -DCT scatter corrected images as compared to uncorrected s -
DCT images.   Fifty (50) patients undergoing a clinical non-contrast CT for their lung nodules will be asked to have this procedure (scan) within [ADDRESS_95109], with no intervening procedures or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87209] (ie, excision or biopsy).  
7.[ADDRESS_95110] deviation of the average reader score to be 2 (the range of the score is from +3 to - 3), we will 
have at least 80% power to detect 0.[ADDRESS_95111]. Additionally, a random intercept is used in the model to account for the correlation among readers when reading the images from the same patient.  The Wald’s test based on model fit will be used to test whether the grand mean parameter is larger zero. When the p -value from this test 
is less than 0.05, it will be concluded that there exists significant evidence that readers have more confidence with the s -DCT scatter corrected modality 
compared to the conventional s- DCT.  
 The reader preference study form (including both primary and secondary evaluations) is located in the Appendix. 
7.[ADDRESS_95112] (IRB) Approval and Consent 
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. 
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.    Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_44316]. Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001]-approved consent form.

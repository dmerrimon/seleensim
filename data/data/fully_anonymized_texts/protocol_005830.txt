SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title  
 
An Open -label, Nonrandomized, Single -dose, Parallel -group, Safety, Tolerance, and 
Pharmacokinetic Study of LOXO -305 Administered to Fasted Hepatically Impaired Male and 
Female Subjects and Fasted Matched -control Healthy Subjects  
 
Objectives  
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 
LOXO -305 in subjects with impaired hepatic function compared to matched -control healthy 
subjects.  
 
The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO -305 in 
subjects with impaired hepatic function and matched -control healthy subjects.  
 
Study Design  
 
This study is an open -label, nonrandomized, multi -center, single -dose, parallel -group study to 
determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of LOXO -305 administered orally at a dose of  
200 mg to fasted adult males and females with mild, moderate, or severe impaired hepatic 
function and healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatic function will be 
classified based on the Child -Pugh (CP) classification of hepatic impairment.  
 
Subjects will be recruited in this study so that up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up 
to 8 subjects with mild impairment, up to 8 subjects with moderate impairment, and up to 8 
subjects with severe impairment, per CP classification – assessed at Screening and verified at 
Check -in [Day -1]) and [ADDRESS_463248] 6 subjects with normal hepatic function complete the study. Hepatically impaired 
subjects will be assigned to groups according to CP scores at Check -in (Day -1) to ensure 
stability of hepatic impairment and subject safety, as determined by [CONTACT_737] (or 
designee). Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their CP score at 
Screening and Check -in (Day -1) as judged by [CONTACT_737] (or designee), Covance 
Medical Monitor, and Sponsor:  
 
• Group 1: Matched -control healthy subjects with normal hepatic  function;  
• Group 2: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or  6); 
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to  9); 
• Group 4: Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (CP Class C, score of 10 to  15); 
A parallel -design strategy will be adopted for the hepatic impairment groups, with interim 
reviews of safety data after the first 2 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment 
subjects) and Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) and matched -control healthy 
subjects are enrolled and have completed all study -related assessments including the follow - 
up phone call. The safety data will include adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs),

Protocol Version 2.0, 07 October 2020  Page 6 of 69   
  
vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory 
evaluations. Enrollment and dosing for remaining subjects in any group may occur after the 
interim data for that group are reviewed and the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or 
designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed with dosing. If available, PK data and 
matched -control healthy subject data may also be used during the interim review.  
 
Each matched -control healthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by 
[CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), body mass index (BMI; ± 20%), and sex to the completed hepatic 
impairment subject(s). Should another hepatic impairment subject be identified with whom 
an already enrolled healthy subject is demographically matched, the healthy subject may also 
be matched with that impaired subject as long as the impaired subject is in a different hepatic 
impairment group. Each subject with normal hepatic function may be matched with up to [ADDRESS_463249] within each hepatic impairment group.  
 
To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check -in). 
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the 
Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor and the 
Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened 
subjects will be provided a new subject number.  
 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day -1) until End of 
Treatment (EOT) on Day 8 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early 
Termination (ET) if the subject discontinues. A follow -up phone call will occur for all 
subjects who received a dose of study drug (including subjects who are terminated early) 
7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET.  
 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained through 168 hours postdose.  
 
In this study, physical examinations, 12 -lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, How Do You 
Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology 
panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2 ), and recording of concomitant medications will be 
performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and details on each 
study variable, refer to Appendix 4 ). 
 
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events 
will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the Informed Consent Form [ICF] 
until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not 
complete a follow -up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration 
on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) 
or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration 
on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if 
the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of 
relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to 
study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from 
the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does 
not complete a follow -up phone call) are to be reported.

Number of Subjects  
 
A total of up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up to 8 subjects with mild impairment, 
up to 8 subjects with moderate impairment, and up to 8 subjects with severe impairment, per 
CP classification) and approximately [ADDRESS_463250] 4 subjects meet severe hepatic impairment 
criteria per the National Cancer Institute's Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI -ODWG) 
classification, at least [ADDRESS_463251] 4 subjects meet mild hepatic impairment criteria per NCI -ODWG 
classification. Subjects who withdraw or drop out of the study may be replaced if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
Main Criteria for Inclusion  
 
Male subjects and female subjects of nonchildbearing potential, between 18 and 75 years of 
age, inclusive, at Screening, and within BMI range 18.5 to 40.0 kg/m2, inclusive. Subjects 
will be in good general health, except for additional specific inclusion criteria related to 
subjects with hepatic impairment, based on medical history, physical examination findings, 
vital sign measurements, ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations at Screening and Check -in 
(Day -1), as determined by [CONTACT_737] (or designee).

Serial PK blood samples for the analysis of plasma concentrations of LOXO -305 will be 
collected from predose through 168 hours postdose.  
 
The following PK parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO -305 (as appropriate): area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) from hour [ADDRESS_463253] measurable concentration (AUC 0-t), AUC from hour 0 
extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf), percentage extrapolation for AUC 0-inf (%AUC extrap), 
maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), time to maximum observed plasma 
concentration (t max), apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z), apparent systemic 
clearance (CL/F), apparent plasma terminal elimination half -life (t ½), mean residence time 
(MRT ), unbound fraction (f u), and apparent volume of distribution (V z/F). 
 
The f u value determined for each subject will be used to calculate the following unbound 
LOXO -[ADDRESS_463254]: Unbound C max (Cmax,u), unbound 
AUC 0-t (AUC 0-t,u), unbound AUC 0-inf (AUC 0-inf,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V d/F 
(Vz/F,u). 
 
Safety:  
 
Safety will be monitored with AE inquiries, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign 
measurements, ECGs, and physical examinations.  
 
Statistical Methods  
 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO -[ADDRESS_463255] of hepatic function group on the PK of a 
single dose of LOXO -305, paired t -tests will be performed for each hepatic impairment group 
(by [CONTACT_370288]) versus the normal group with respect to 1 -to-1 matching.  
 
In addition, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the natural log (ln) - 
transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. The ANCOVA model will contain a categorical 
factor of population for subjects with varied -degree hepatic impairment (severe, moderate, 
and mild by [CONTACT_370288]) and healthy matched -control subjects, a categorical covariate 
(sex), and continuous covariates (age and BMI). Ratios of least squares means and 90% 
confidence intervals will be calculated using the exponentiation of the difference between 
hepatic function cohort least squares means from the ANCOVA analyses on the ln - 
transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. In addition, an ANCOVA will be performed on the 
natural log (ln) -transformed unbound AUC 0-t, unbound AUC 0-inf, and unbound C max. Similar 
ANCOVA analysis will be applied for evaluating the effect of hepatic function group by 
[CONTACT_12134]-ODWG classification.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), LOXO -305.1 
1.1. Background  
 
LOXO -305 (also known as LY3527727) is a selective inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) being developed by [CONTACT_132189]. LOXO -[ADDRESS_463264] from the approved 
BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib) in several important ways 
including on the basis of its selectivity, favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion properties, and non -covalent binding mode.2 The non -covalent binding mode of 
LOXO -305 is unaffected by [CONTACT_132190] C481 substitutions, a common mechanism of drug 
resistance described for all available covalent inhibitors.3,4,5,6,7 These features enable  
LOXO -305 dosed orally at 100 mg and higher once daily (QD) to achieve pharmacokinetic 
(PK) exposures that exceed the concentration required for 90% inhibition (IC 90) of BTK -wild 
type and BTK C481 at trough and thus deliver tonic BTK target inhibition throughout the 
dosing period, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover. LOXO -305 is also a highly 
selective molecule, with more than 300 -fold more selectivity for BTK versus 370 other 
kinases tested and no significant inhibition of non -kinase off -targets at 1 μM, thus limiting 
the potential for off -target mediated toxicities. Collectively, these unique properties of 
LOXO -305 are expected to deliver more potent, continuous, and selective inhibition of BTK 
in a variety of settings, potentially resulting in increased efficacy. Of note, the activity of 
LOXO -305 in diverse preclinical model systems supports this underlying  hypothesis.2 
LOXO -305 is a small molecule that was designed to block the adenosine triphosphate 
binding site of the BTK competitively, with no evidence of irreversible binding.  
 
1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and  Toxicology  
 
LOXO -305 had high permeability in vitro, but low aqueous solubility. To reduce the 
variability in oral absorption, a spray -dried dispersion (SDD) tablet formulation was 
developed that showed consistent oral bioavailability of approximately 50% in rats and 80% 
in dogs. The bioavailability of the SDD formulation was also not dependent on feeding state 
in dogs.  
 
As is common in rodents, oral exposure of LOXO -305 was consistently much higher in 
female rats than in males given the same dose of LOXO -305. The sex difference was also 
apparent after intravenous (IV) administration of LOXO -305. There was no difference in the 
PK of LOXO -305 between sexes of dog, and none is expected in other non -rodent species, 
including humans.  
 
The volume of distribution (V z) of LOXO -305 ranged from approximately 2 L/kg in the dog 
to 5 L/kg in the male rat, which indicates that LOXO -305 distributes into tissues. LOXO -305 
had protein binding of approximately 95% in human plasma. A somewhat lower extent of 
binding (approximately 82% to 92%) was observed across mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog.

Protocol  
Covance Study: 8419691  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version 2.0, 07 October 2020  Page 18 of 69   
  
LOXO -305 is a substrate of P -gp and BCRP. It is not a substrate of the hepatic transporters 
OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or BSEP.  
 
1.4. Summary of Clinical Experience  
 
LOXO -305 is currently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/[ADDRESS_463275] -in-human study, 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] (the BRUIN Study), in patients with previously treated chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). The starting dose of LOXO -[ADDRESS_463276] dose administered ( Section 1.4.1 ). As of 30 March 2020 (data cutoff date), PK 
data were available from 107 patients ( Section 1.4.2 ). 
 
LOXO -305 was recently investigated in 1 study in healthy volunteers (LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]). 
LOXO -BTK -[ADDRESS_463277] cross -over study evaluating the effects of food and a 
proton -pump inhibitor (omeprazole) on the PK of LOXO -305 where 10 healthy volunteers 
were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 3 separate days, each followed by a washout period.  
Two additional studies are ongoing in healthy volunteers (LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] and LOXO - 
BTK -[ZIP_CODE]). LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] is a drug -drug interaction study evaluating the effects of a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) and a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) on the PK 
of LOXO -305 where, at the time of protocol development, 6 healthy volunteers were given 1 
dose of 200 mg of LOXO -305, 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 2 
separate days (1 of which was co -administered with itraconazole), each followed by a 
washout period, and 9 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 3 separate 
days (2 of which were co -administered with rifampin), each followed by a washout period.  
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] is a single ascending dose study evaluating the safety and tolerability of 
LOXO -305 at 300 mg, up to 600 mg, up to 800 mg, and up to 900 mg (if necessary), where, 
at the time of protocol development [ADDRESS_463278] -in-human study  
(LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]) and received LOXO -305 at doses ranging from 25 mg QD to 300 mg 
QD. A full summary of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for patients in this study 
is provided in the LOXO -305 IB and the Investigator is directed to the safety information 
described in that document.1 
Overall, TEAEs were reported in 123 of 172 treated patients in the safety population and 
were mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2) in 89 of 123 (51.7%) patients and were 
Grade 3 or 4 in severity in 33 of 123 (19.2%) patients. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
occurring in ≥ 10% of patients were fatigue (12.8% total, 7.0% related) and diarrhea (10.5% 
total, 6.4% related). The most frequently reported drug -related TEAEs (those in > 5% of 
patients) were fatigue (7.0%), diarrhea (6.4%), and contusion (5.2%). All other drug -related 
TEAEs occurred in < 5% of patients each. The most frequently reported Grade ≥ 3  TEAEs  
included neutropenia (4.1% total; 2.9% related), neutrophil count decreased (2.3% total; 1.2%

hepatic impairment, up to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, up to 8 subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment, and 8 to 24 healthy subjects with normal hepatic function will be 
enrolled. The PK and safety profiles between each hepatic impairment group and their 
matching (age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]) healthy subjects will be compared.  
 
1.6. Risk  Assessment  
 
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment 
of their medical status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are 
primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may 
also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. More 
information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs 
associated with LOXO -305 may be found in the IB.  1 
Single doses of 200 mg LOXO -305 were investigated in a study conducted in healthy 
volunteers (LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]) where 10 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of 
LOXO -305 on 3 separate days, each followed by a washout period. Two additional studies 
are ongoing in healthy volunteers (LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] and LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]).  
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] is a drug -drug interaction study evaluating the effects of a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) and a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) on the PK of 
LOXO -305 where, at the time of protocol development, 6 healthy volunteers were given 1 
dose of 200 mg of LOXO -305, 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 2 
separate days (1 of which was co -administered with itraconazole), each followed by a 
washout period, and 9 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 3 separate 
days (2 of which were co -administered with rifampin), each followed by a washout period. 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] is a single ascending dose study evaluating the safety and tolerability of 
LOXO -305 at 300 mg, up to 600 mg, up to 800 mg, and up to 900 mg (if necessary) where, at 
the time of protocol development 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 300 mg 
LOXO -305 and 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 600 mg LOXO -305. 
 
From AE data reported following LOXO -305 administration in 10 healthy volunteers in the 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study, all TEAEs (headache, nausea, and vomiting) were Grade [ADDRESS_463291] and 
resolved within 1 to 1.5 days (data on file at the time of protocol development). From 
preliminary AE data reported following LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers in 
the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study, all TEAEs (intermittent belching, bloating, insect bite, 
aphthous ulcer, nausea, intermittent diarrhea [x2], muscle twitch) were Grade 1 in severity 
and bloating, intermittent diarrhea and intermittent belching were considered related to 
LOXO -305. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events resolved prior to EOT; data 
on file at the time of protocol development). From preliminary AE data reported following 
LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers in Cohort 1 of the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study, 
there was one TEAE (headache) observed in the 300 mg LOXO -305 Cohort which was 
Grade 1 in severity and considered related to LOXO -305. The event resolved within 2 hours 
(data on file at the time of protocol  development).  
 
The safety monitoring practices employed will include AE reporting, vital sign 
measurements, 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory evaluations, and 
physical examinations, and are considered adequate to protect the subjects’ safety.

2. OBJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Objectives  
2.1.1.  Primary  Objective  
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the PK profile of LOXO -305 in subjects 
with impaired hepatic function compared to matched -control healthy subjects.  
 
2.1.2.  Secondary  Objective  
 
The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO -305 in 
subjects with impaired hepatic function and matched -control healthy subjects.  
 
2.2. Endpoints  
2.2.1.  Primary  Endpoints  
 
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO -305: 
 
• Cmax 
• tmax 
• area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from hour [ADDRESS_463292] measurable  
concentration  (AUC 0-t) 
• AUC from hour 0 extrapolated to infinity  (AUC 0-inf) 
• percentage extrapolation for AUC 0-inf (%AUC extrap) 
• apparent terminal elimination rate constant  (λz) 
• apparent plasma terminal elimination half -life (t½) 
• apparent systemic clearance  (CL/F)  
• apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase  (Vz/F) 
• mean residence time  (MRT).  
In addition, a single blood sample will be collected predose to determine the fraction 
unbound (f u) of LOXO -305 in plasma and, whenever possible, the following PK parameters 
will be calculated for unbound LOXO -305 using f u: unbound C max (Cmax,u), unbound AUC 0-t 
(AUC 0-t,u), unbound AUC 0-inf (AUC 0-inf,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V z/F 
(Vz/F,u). 
 
2.2.2.  Secondary  Endpoints  
 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_42466], performing physical examinations 
and clinical laboratory evaluations, measuring vital signs, and recording ECGs.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and  Plan  
 
This study is an open -label, nonrandomized, multi -center, single -dose, parallel -group study to 
determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of LOXO -305 administered orally at a dose of  
200 mg to fasted adult males and females with mild, moderate, or severe impaired hepatic 
function and healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatic function will be 
classified based on the CP classification of hepatic impairment ( Table 3 ).9,10 
Subjects will be recruited in this study so that up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up 
to 8 subjects with mild impairment, up to 8 subjects with moderate impairment, and up to 8 
subjects with severe impairment, per CP classification – assessed at Screening and verified at 
Check -in [Day -1]) and [ADDRESS_463293] 6 subjects with normal hepatic function complete the study. Hepatically impaired 
subjects will be assigned to groups according to CP scores at Check -in (Day -1) to ensure 
stability of hepatic impairment and subject safety, as determined by [CONTACT_737] [or 
designee]. Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their CP score at 
Screening and Check -in (Day -1) as judged by [CONTACT_737] (or designee), Covance 
Medical Monitor, and Sponsor:  
 
• Group 1: Matched -control healthy subjects with normal hepatic  function;  
• Group 2: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or  6); 
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to  9); 
• Group 4: Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (CP Class C, score of 10 to  15). 
A parallel -design strategy will be adopted for the hepatic impairment groups, with interim 
reviews (as detailed in Section 8.2 ) of the safety data after the first 2 subjects from Group 2 
(mild hepatic impairment subjects) and Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) and 
matched -control healthy subjects are enrolled and have completed all study -related 
assessments including the follow -up phone call.  
 
Each matched -control healthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by 
[CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), BMI (± 20%), and sex to the completed hepatic impairment subject(s).  
Should another hepatic impairment subject be identified with whom an already enrolled 
healthy subject is demographically matched, the healthy subject may also be matched with 
that impaired subject as long as the impaired subject is in a different hepatic impairment 
group. Each subject with normal hepatic function may be matched with up to [ADDRESS_463294] who is enrolled in the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). 
Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned a dose of study 
drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects. Replacement subjects may be enrolled 
only if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].

To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check -in). 
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the 
Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor and the 
Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened 
subjects will be provided a new subject number.  
 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day -1) until EOT on Day 8 
upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early Termination (ET) if the subject 
discontinues. A follow -up phone call will occur for all subjects who received a dose of study 
drug (including subjects who are terminated early) 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET. The 
duration of participation is expected to be approximately 46 days (Screening through  
follow -up phone call).  
 
On the morning of Day 1, after at least an [ADDRESS_463295], a single oral dose of 200 mg 
LOXO -305 will be administered with 240 mL of water. No food will be allowed for up to 
2 hours postdose. Glucose tablets may be administered as needed for treatment of 
hypoglycemia. For instructions regarding food and water intake, refer to Section 6.2 . 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained through 168 hours postdose.  
 
Figure 2: Study Design Schematic  
ICF = Informed Consent Form; PK = pharmacokinetic.  
Note: Single oral dose of LOXO -[ADDRESS_463296].  
 
In this study, physical examinations, 12 -lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, How Do You 
Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology 
panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2 ), and recording of concomitant medications will be 
performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and details on each 
study variable, refer to Appendix 4 ). 
 
Adverse events and serious AEs (SAEs) will be collected beginning at informed consent. 
Adverse events will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of 
Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a 
follow -up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning 
prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) or as AEs 
(if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if the event 
occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship

to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF 
signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a 
follow -up phone call) are to be reported.  
 
A Schedule of Assessments is presented in Appendix [ADDRESS_463297]’s follow -up. 
 
3.2. Child -Pugh  Classification  
Per FDA Guidance12 hepatic impairment will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe using 
the CP System ( Table 3 ),9,[ADDRESS_463298] 
with hepatic impairment will be collected at Screening and Check -in (Day -1). Further data 
analysis will be performed using NCI -ODWG classification (see Section 8 ).

• Grade 4: unarousable coma, no personality/behavior, decerebrate, or slow 2 to 3 cycles per second delta  activity.  
b Ascites is graded according to the following criteria:  
• Absent: No ascites is detectable by [CONTACT_42516], if ultrasound investigation 
is performed;  
• Slight: Ascites palpi[INVESTIGATOR_42426], but ascites measurable by [CONTACT_42474], if  performed;  
• Moderate: Ascites detectable by [CONTACT_42475][INVESTIGATOR_42427], if  performed;  
• Severe: Necessity of paracentesis; does not respond to medication  treatment.  
c A subject with hepatic encephalopathy of Grade 2 or above would not be admitted into the study.

3.4. Discussion of Study  Design  
 
A single -dose, parallel design is the standard design to investigate the PK of a drug in 
subjects with hepatic impairment. A parallel design is required to include subjects with 
hepatic impairment and matched -control healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. A 
single dose level of LOXO -[ADDRESS_463303] 2 subjects from 
Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects) and Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment 
subjects) and matched -control healthy subjects may be dosed concurrently, followed by [CONTACT_370289] (if available) before dosing is resumed for the 
remaining subjects in any (all) group(s) (see Section 8.2 ). 
3.5. Selection of Doses in the Study 
LOXO -305 
Single oral doses of 200 mg LOXO -305 will be evaluated as this dose level given QD has 
been chosen as the recommended Phase 2 dose for the ongoing global Phase 1/[ADDRESS_463304]-in-human study, LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] (BRUIN Study). Doses of LOXO -[ADDRESS_463305] been evaluated in the ongoing global Phase 1/[ADDRESS_463306] -in-human study, 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] (BRUIN Study), in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL or NHL 
with dose escalation up to 300 mg QD approved by [CONTACT_1758]’s Safety Review Committee.  
The available data demonstrate that LOXO -[ADDRESS_463307] been identified in humans.1

4.6. Removal of Subjects from Study  Participation  
 
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for 
any reason. The Investigator (or designee) may remove a subject from the study if, in the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue 
the study. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the following:  
 
• change in compliance with inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant and 
affects subject  safety  
• occurrence of  AEs 
• occurrence of  pregnancy  
• intake of non -permitted concomitant medication that might affect subject safety or 
study assessments/objectives,  etc. 
 
Notification of withdrawal will immediately be made to the Study Monitor. In case of 
withdrawal, efforts will be made to perform all ET assessments ( Appendix 4 ). The date the 
subject is withdrawn from the study and the reason for withdrawal will be recorded on the 
subject’s electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). All withdrawn subjects with AEs that are 
assessed as related to study drug and which are ongoing at ET may continue to be followed 
until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) and confirmed by [CONTACT_1034].

specific guidance to the CRU regarding the EOS procedures.  
 
4.7. Matching  Process  
 
A matched -control healthy subject will be matched to hepatically impaired subjects (age  
[± 10 years], BMI [± 20%], and sex). An individual matched -control healthy subject may be 
matched with up to [ADDRESS_463322] within each hepatic impairment group (ie, to a maximum of  
3 hepatically impaired subjects across the study [1 mild, 1 moderate, and 1 severe], but to no 
more than [ADDRESS_463323] in each impairment group). A listing of the matched subjects will be 
included in the Clinical Study Report.

a Specific ingredients/purity will be identified in the Certificate of Analysis (or equivalent) that is supplied with 
the study drug(s).  
 
The tablets containing 100 mg LOXO -305 will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee), 
along with the batch/lot numbers and Certificate of Analysis. It will be provided in  
high-density polyethylene bottles and stored according to the instructions on the label. 
Study drugs will be stored at the CRU in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
The bulk drug container and unit dose containers will be labeled in accordance with national 
laws and regulations. The study drugs will be stored in accordance with the labeling. The 
study drugs will be transferred from bulk supplies into the subject’s dose container by 
[CONTACT_132203]. Each unit dose container will be appropriately labeled.  
 
5.2. Study Treatment  Administration  
 
Subjects will receive a single dose of LOXO -305, given orally as two 100 -mg tablets 
(200-mg total dose) in the morning on Day 1.  
 
The study drug will be administered orally with approximately [ADDRESS_463324] 8 hours from food (not including water) and will be followed by a fast from food 
for at least 2 hours postdose. Water will be restricted for 1 -hour predose and 1 -hour postdose, 
with the exception of water administered for dose administration. Glucose tablets may be 
administered as needed for treatment of hypoglycemia.  
 
Each unit dose will be prepared by [CONTACT_132204]. Each unit dose container will be 
appropriately labeled.  
 
Appropriate unit dose(s), as described above, will be administered to subjects. Although the 
timing of events requires that each subject will be consistently administered the appropriate 
dose at a specific time, the exact dose time of subjects may be staggered to obviate the need 
to have all subjects on precisely the same study schedule. For each dose, the subject’s actual 
dose time will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the eCRF.

Processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_370286] a separate Laboratory Manual. The number of blood samples and 
total blood volume required for PK testing and protein binding is presented in Appendix 3 . 
 
7.1.2.  Analytical  Methodology  
 
Concentrations of LOXO -305 in plasma will be determined using a validated bioanalytical 
method. Specifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a separate document. The 
concentrations of total and unbound LOXO -305 will be determined in a sample of predose 
plasma fortified with a known concentration of LOXO -305. The unbound fraction will be 
calculated based on total and unbound LOXO -305 levels. Samples of plasma may be 
analyzed for exploratory analyses of metabolites. If such analyses are conducted, the results 
will be reported separately by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
7.2. Safety and Tolerability  Assessments  
 
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Covance Medical Monitor, 
Investigator (or designee), or Sponsor.  
 
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, 
and any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for 
scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
 
• dosing  
• PK blood  sampling  
• vital sign  measurements  
• 12-lead ECGs  
• blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory  evaluations  
• physical  examination.  
7.2.1.  Adverse  Events  
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and 
procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1 .

Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version 2.0, 07 October 2020  Page 44 of 69   
  
Subjects will be asked a non -leading HDYF? Question such as “Have there been any changes 
in your health status since Screening/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4  (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in [Day -1], at each 
postdose vital sign measurements, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will 
also be encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS.  
 
Adverse events, whether volunteered, identified by [CONTACT_423]’s responses to HDYF? 
Inquiries, or noted on physical examination, ECG, vital sign measurements, or clinical 
laboratory evaluations, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF 
until EOS [or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a  
follow -up phone call]), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning 
prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) or as AEs 
(if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if the event 
occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship 
to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF 
signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a 
follow -up phone call) are to be reported.  
 
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study and does not complete the 
follow -up phone call, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are 
assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) that are ongoing at EOS 
may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable 
levels, as judged by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and confirmed by [CONTACT_1034]. The 
Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as 
necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety 
tests be performed.  
 
Subjects will receive a follow -up phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine 
if any SAE or drug -related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.  
 
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator (or designee).  
 
Any event that meets the criteria of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to CRU policy 
by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and to regulatory authorities by [CONTACT_1034] (or Sponsor 
designee) according to regulatory authority requirements. Refer to Reference Safety 
Information in the current IB for LOXO -305 for additional safety information. 1 
7.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory  Evaluations

Screens for HCV antibody (healthy matched -control subjects only), HbsAg, HBV IgM core 
antibody, and HIV antibody will be performed at Screening.  
 
Testing for COVID -[ADDRESS_463329]’s 
CRU confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee). Further details 
regarding COVID -19 testing (including procedures for subjects who test positive at any time 
throughout CRU confinement) are specified in a separate  document.  
 
A urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine [matched -control healthy 
subjects only] and alcohol [urine or breath test]) will be performed at Screening and repeated 
at Check -in (Day -1) for all subjects. A serum qualitative pregnancy test (female subjects 
only [serum quantitative may be used for confirmation if needed]) and an FSH test  
(post -menopausal female subjects only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix [ADDRESS_463330] of the specific evaluations is in Appendix 2 . 
 
7.2.3.  Vital  Signs  
 
Vital sign measurements (including body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation, 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991], and pulse rate) will be obtained at the timepoints specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_463331] 5 minutes.  
 
When vital sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood 
draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital sign measurements will be 
obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled blood draw.  
 
7.2.4.  12-lead Electrocardiogram  
 
A 12 -lead ECG (including heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) will be 
obtained after the subject has been resting for at least 10 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_132179] 4 . The QT interval will be corrected for heart rate by 
[CONTACT_6550]’s (QTcF = QT/[RR]1/3) formula.  
When 12 -lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be 
obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained prior to and as 
close as possible to the scheduled blood draw.  
 
7.2.5.  Physical  Examination  
 
A complete or abbreviated physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4 . Complete physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the 
following body systems/organs: dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; 
pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and 
neurological. Weight and height will be reported (height only reported during Screening).

8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA  ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample  Size 
 
A total of up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up to 8 subjects from each hepatic 
impairment group, per CP classification) and approximately [ADDRESS_463332] 2 subjects from Group 2 (mild 
hepatic impairment subjects) and Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) and 
matched -control healthy subjects are enrolled and have completed all study -related 
assessments including the follow -up phone call. The safety data will include AEs and SAEs, 
vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Enrollment and 
dosing for remaining subjects in any group may occur after the interim data for that group are 
reviewed and the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it 
is safe to proceed with dosing.  
 
Each interim review will be a teleconference between the Covance Medical Monitor, 
Investigator (or designee), and/or Sponsor to discuss safety data.  
 
If available, PK data and matched -control healthy subject data may also be used during the 
interim review.  
 
8.3. Analysis  Populations  
8.3.1.  Study  Populations  
 
The PK Population will consist of all subjects who have received a dose of study drug, have 
at least [ADDRESS_463333] 1 dose of study 
drug. Subjects will be classified into groups based on actual treatment received.

Other parameters may be added as appropriate. Final PK parameters reported will be detailed 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. All statistical 
analysis will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 or greater. More details on the analyses 
will be included in the SAP.  
 
8.4.1.  Descriptive  Analysis  
 
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized separately by [CONTACT_370294]-ODWG hepatic function classification with descriptive statistics (number, arithmetic 
mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation [CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, 
median, minimum, and maximum). In addition, summary statistics for protein binding will be 
tabulated separately by [CONTACT_370295] -ODWG hepatic function group.  
 
8.4.2.  Statistical  Methodology  
 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO -[ADDRESS_463337] of hepatic function group on the PK of a 
single dose of LOXO -305, paired t -tests will be performed for each hepatic impairment group 
(by [CONTACT_370288]) versus the normal group with respect to 1 -to-1 matching.  
 
In addition, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the natural log (ln) - 
transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. The ANCOVA model will contain a categorical 
factor of population for subjects with varied -degree hepatic impairment (severe, moderate, 
and mild by [CONTACT_370288]) and healthy matched -control subjects, a categorical covariate 
(sex), and continuous covariates (age and BMI). Ratios of least squares means and 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated using the exponentiation of the difference 
between hepatic function cohort least squares means from the ANCOVA analyses on  the 
ln-transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. In addition, an ANCOVA will be performed on 
the natural log (ln) -transformed unbound AUC 0-t, unbound AUC 0-inf, and unbound C max. The 
specific procedures will be documented in the SAP. Similar ANCOVA analysis will be 
applied for evaluating the effect of hepatic function group by [CONTACT_12134] -ODWG  classification.  
 
8.5. Safety  Analysis  
 
All safety assessments, including AEs and SAEs, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory 
results, physical examination results, concomitant medications, and [ADDRESS_463338].  
 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary (WHO Drug Global B3, September 2019). Adverse events will be coded using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 22.1 (or higher). The incidence of AEs 
for each hepatic function (matched -control healthy subjects, mild, moderate, and severe) will 
be presented by [CONTACT_370296]: 8419691  CONFIDENTIAL

Appendix 1: Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienced by a patient or healthy adult subject, whether or not considered drug -related by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee). A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that 
starts on or after the first administration of study drug.  
 
The following are all AEs:  
 
• unfavorable changes in general condition  
• subjective or objective  signs/symptoms  
• concomitant diseases or accidents  
• clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
during a clinical  study.  
 
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective 
disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, 
irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance.  
 
Categorization of Adverse Events  
 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows:  
 
• Grade 1 Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not  indicated  
• Grade 2 Moderate: Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living  (ADL)*  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL**  
• Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences: An event that puts the subject at 
immediate risk of  death  
• Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money,  etc. 
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version 2.0, 07 October 2020  Page 58 of 69   
  
The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2 -category system according to the following guidelines:  
 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the administration of investigational 
product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) 
is suspected.  
• RELATED = The time course between administration of investigational product 
and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship 
and no other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) 
can be  identified.  
 
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
 
Pregnancy  
 
As information is available, a pregnancy (including pregnancy in female partners of male 
subjects) diagnosed through End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET; if the subject 
discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call) and for up to  
90 days after Day 1 should be reported by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) via email to Covance 
or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of being notified. Covance or 
the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will then forward the Pregnancy Form to the 
Investigator (or designee) for completion.  
 
email: [EMAIL_2654]  
 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the 
study and ET study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be followed 
by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for 
any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator (or designee) should notify Covance 
or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the 
Investigator (or designee) will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious adverse event (SAE; ie, 
postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly), the Investigator (or designee) should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
 
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator (or designee) immediately if they 
discover their sexual partner is pregnant. In this instance, the partner must provide written 
consent before pregnancy information can be collected. When a Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) becomes aware that the female partner of a male subject is pregnant, they are to 
contact [CONTACT_737] (or designee) immediately (within 24 hours of the CRU staff 
becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical 
Safety Representative via email.  
 
All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE electronic Case Report Form (eCRF; as 
appropriate), in addition to completion of the required pregnancy forms. If the Investigator 
(or designee) suspects that a pregnancy was the result of an interaction between the study

Protocol Version 2.0, 07 October 2020  Page 59 of 69   
  
treatment and the contraceptive method, in addition to the pregnancy the drug interaction 
should also be captured as a separate AE.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
 
An SAE (by [CONTACT_7214] [FDA] definition) is any adverse drug experience 
occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of  death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• A persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the above  outcomes.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
 
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed 
in the Reference Safety Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or if it is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed for an unapproved investigational 
medicinal product (IMP).  
 
Reporting  
 
Food and Drug Administration -reportable AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that are assessed as serious, related, and unexpected. Food and 
Drug Administration -reportable AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_132220] (IRB). Final determination of whether an event 
represents a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) will be the 
responsibility of the Sponsor.  
 
Within [ADDRESS_463340] recognized or 
reported, and within 24 hours of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is assessed as 
related or unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, Covance or the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will be notified by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) in 
writing using the following email address:  
 
email: [EMAIL_2654]  
 
To report the SAE, the completed report form should be sent by [CONTACT_132221]’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incoming reports are

reviewed during normal business hours. Additional reporting instructions and the SAE Report 
Form are provided in the Study Manual.  
 
The IRB will be notified of any FDA -reportable AE within the timeframe required by [CONTACT_5040]. The IRB Serious and Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be 
completed and submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE.

 Appendix 5: Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes  
Protocol Version 2.0 (dated 7th October 2020) incorporated the following changes in Protocol 
Version 1.0 (dated 7th August 2020):  
• Additional data from non -clinical studies with LOXO -305 has been added to 
Section 1.2, Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and  Toxicology . 
• Additional data from clinical studies with LOXO -305 has been added to Section 1.4, 
Summary of Clinical Experience , Section 1.4.1, Safety , and Section 1.6, Risk 
Assessment.  
• The Protocol has been updated to allow glucose tablets to be administered as needed 
for treatment of hypoglycaemia during the study as a safety  precaution.  
• The number of subjects aimed to be enrolled into each National Cancer Institute's 
Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI -ODWG) classification for hepatic 
impairment has been clarified throughout the Protocol from a minimum of [ADDRESS_463367] 4 subjects meeting mild hepatic impairment criteria per 
NCI-ODWG  classification.  
• Table 4, National Cancer Institute -Organ Dysfunction Working Group for Hepatic 
Dysfunction Criteria has been corrected such that the criteria for mild hepatic 
impairment and severe hepatic impairment are consistent with the criteria used in the 
publication cited in the  Protocol.  
• The requirements for hepatitis C virus antibody testing have been clarified throughout 
the Protocol to state that this will be conducted in healthy matched -control subjects 
only to be consistent with Section 4.1, Screening Procedures , #13. 
• The requirements for hepatitis B virus testing have been clarified throughout the 
Protocol to state that it will be performed using an immunoglobulin M (IgM) core 
antibody  test. 
• The requirements for oral temperature measurements to be taken have been revised 
throughout the Protocol, to allow any type of temperature measurements to be taken 
to provide flexibility to study  sites.  
• The duration of contraceptive requirements for male subjects without documentation 
of sterilization has been clarified to state that male subjects must follow 1 of the 
contraception methods listed under inclusion criterion #5b from Day 1 through 6 
months after Day  1. 
• The contraceptive requirements for sexual intercourse between male subjects with 
female partners who are pregnant or breastfeeding has been clarified to state that this 
should be avoided from Check -in (Day -1) through [ADDRESS_463368] uses a condom with  spermicide.  
• Inclusion criterion #12 has been amended to reduce the acceptable hemoglobin level 
from ≥ 9 g/dL to ≥ 8 g/dL for subjects who have anemia secondary to hepatic disease, 
where anemia symptoms are not clinically significant. This criterion has been  updated  
Protocol  
Covance Study: 8419691  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ADDRESS_463369] safety.  
• Exclusion criterion #4 has been revised to allow clinically significant (as determined 
by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) abnormal clinical laboratory results (excluding 
those further defined in exclusion criteria #23, #24, #25, #26, #36, and #37) to be 
repeated up to 2 times during Screening and Check -in (Day -1) to confirm eligibility 
for study participation if the values fall within normal ranges or are stabilizing. This 
change has been made to account for transient abnormal  results.  
• Exclusion criteria #8 and #[ADDRESS_463370] 
been updated to remove the Investigator (or designee) and Sponsor discretion for 
inclusion of subjects who consume grapefruit/grapefruit juice, Seville oranges or its 
juice or alcohol or caffeine -containing foods or beverages within the specified time 
prior to Check -in (Day -1). This has been amended as consumption of any of the 
noted items in the specified time prior to Check -in (Day -1) would not be permitted in 
any circumstance.  
• Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_463371] of specified restricted over -the-counter and 
prescription medications to provide further guidance to the sites.  
• The duration of the restriction for prescription and over -the-counter medication prior 
to Day 1 in Exclusion criterion #13, Section 6.1, Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and 
Appendix 4, Schedule of Assessments , footnote r has been amended to 14 days or 5 
half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day [ADDRESS_463372] a prolonged  half-life. 
• Exclusion criterion #16 ‘ Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <50 mL/min 
at Screening or Check -in (Day -1) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
formula ’, has been replaced with exclusion criteria #24 (healthy subjects) and #36 
(hepatic impairment subjects only). Exclusion criteria #24 and #36 specify that the 
Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD -EPI) equation will be 
used to calculate eGFR, and per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
recommendation, healthy subjects with an eGFR < 90 mL/minute/1.73m2 , mild and 
moderate hepatically impaired subjects with an eGFR of < 90 mL/minute/1.73m2, and 
severe hepatically impaired subjects with an eGFR of < 60 mL/minute/1.73m2 at 
Screening and Check -in (Day -1) will be excluded. Rechecks of out -of-range eGFR 
values that are not clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_737] [or 
designee]) will be permitted up to 2 times during Screening and Check -in (Day -1) to 
confirm eligibility for study participation if the values fall within the range stated 
above. Appendix 2, Clinical Laboratory Evaluations has been amended to state that 
the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_370287].  
• The exclusion of subjects for white blood cell count and platelet count below the 
lower limit of normal range at Screening and Check -in (Day -1) has been removed 
from exclusion criterion #26. Instead, subjects with clinically significant (as 
determined by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) abnormal white blood cell count and 
platelet count (that do not fall within normal ranges or do not stabilize upon repeat 
assessment) will be excluded per exclusion criterion  #4.

 • Exclusion criteria #20, #22, #23, #25, #26, #34, and #[ADDRESS_463373] been updated to allow 
out of the specified range values that are not clinically significant (as determined by 
[CONTACT_737] [or designee]) to be permitted to be repeated up to 2 times during 
Screening, Check -in (Day -1), and predose on Day 1 (where applicable) to confirm 
eligibility for study. This change has been made to account for transient abnormal 
results.  
• Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_463374] 30  days.  
• The limit for QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) in 
exclusion criterion #34 has been revised to > 450 msec for subjects with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment or > 470 msec for subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), or predose on Day 1 per FDA 
recommendation.  
• Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_463375]  age. 
• Exclusion criterion #37 has been updated to clarify that the decision to deem creatine 
kinase, liver function tests, amylase, and lipase values clinically significant will be 
based on hepatic impairment status as well as  age. 
• Section 4.5, Subject Number and Identification has been clarified to include guidance 
on the numbering of subjects by [CONTACT_42469] (the second set of  digits).  
• Clarification that water will be restricted for 1 -hour predose and 1 -hour postdose, with 
the exception of water administered for dose administration has been  provided.  
• An analysis of covariance statistical analysis has been added to Section 8.4.2,  
Statistical Methodology for natural log (ln) -transformed unbound AUC 0-t, unbound 
AUC 0-inf, and unbound C max per FDA  recommendation.  
• Appendix 4, Schedule of Assessments , footnote o has been clarified to specify the 
measurement timepoint postdose for clinical laboratory  evaluations.  
• Appendix 4, Schedule of Assessments , footnotes f, g, and i, have been clarified to 
specify the measurement timepoint postdose and the allowed measurement window 
for 12 -lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, and oxygen  saturation.  
• 12-lead ECGs are required to be assessed at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), and 
predose on Day 1 according to exclusion criterion #22 of the Protocol. Appendix 4, 
Schedule of Assessments, erroneously omitted a 12 -lead ECG assessment predose on 
Day 1 and has been revised to include  this. 
 
Minor updates:  
 
• The amendment/version number and date were updated throughout the  protocol.  
• Typographical errors and formatting errors were corrected, and minor clarifications 
and corrections were made, as  necessary.  
• The synopsis was updated to be consistent with the changes made to the body  text.

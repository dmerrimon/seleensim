 
 CARILION CLINIC INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 
 
IRB RESEARCH APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS  
 
NOTE: This is a protected document! Please do not remove protections. 
 
The Carilion Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee charged with protecting the rights and 
welfare of human subjects in research. You must submit this application and receive IRB approval if 
you wish to conduct human subjects research at Carilion Clinic, including the Jefferson College of 
Health Sciences, or if you will use Carilion patients or services as part of the research process. The 
entire application must be completed. If you are unsure if your research meets the definition of human 
subjects research, please first visit the  IRB website  for more information. 
 
Research protocols may be reviewed at convened meetings of the IRB or through a single reviewer 
process involving the IRB Chair and staff. The type of review is determined by [CONTACT_603130], the level of potential risk to research subjects, and the characteristics of the subject 
population. The final determination of the type of review applicable to a study is made by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
 Full Board Reviews: Greater than minimal risk research requires review at a convened meeting of 
the IRB. Research that involving vulnerable populations, experimental drugs or devices, invasive 
procedures, or deception (e.g., in behavioral research) may also require full board review. A 
schedule of IRB meetings and submission deadlines can be found on the Carilion IRB website .  
 
Full Board submissions should be sent to Meredith Talmadge at 
[EMAIL_11495] .  For further information, call [PHONE_12502].  
 
 Exempt and Expedited Reviews: Exempt and Expedited studies involve no more than minimal 
risk to subjects.  Federal regulations define minimal risk as the probability that the magnitude of 
harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in of themselves than those 
ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests.  The Carilion IRB must determine whether proposed studies meet the criteria 
for Expedited or Exempt review.  
 
Exempt and Expedited submissions should be sent to Janet McDowell at 
[EMAIL_11496]. For further information, call [PHONE_12503]. 
 
Signature [CONTACT_603181] ([PHONE_12504]. For further 
information call 853-0728.  
 
Note:  Consent Form and Information Sheets should be submitted in Word rather than in 
pdf, as IRB staff may need to make revisions and edits to these documents.  The CV of the

SECTION  III: STUDY PROTOCOL      
 
17. Study Abstract: Provide a brief, non-technical summary of the study, including study purpose and methods. 
 
In this study, we will test whether a remotely delivered epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681] (EFT) 
intervention, combined with dietary and activity coaching, as well as self-monitoring, 
reduces delay discounting and improves weight loss, glycemic control, and other 
health outcomes in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. Specifically, the 
study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of EFT versus a control condition 
on delay discounting, medication adherence, diet, physical activity, body weight, and 
glycemic control. Outcome measures will be assessed both remotely (e.g., online) 
and in the laboratory.  
18. Background:  Summarize background information about the research question(s.)  Tell why the research is 
needed and include the relevance of this research to the contribution of this field of study.  Also, provide 
references to relevant articles in the literature.  (If you have more than [ADDRESS_798686] 
of references as a separate attachment.  Otherwise, please insert them here.) 
 
Successful management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a complex repertoire of 
behaviors, including adherence to physician-recommended medication, dietary, and 
exercise regimens (1, 2). Most of these behaviors provide little to no short-term 
benefit and may rather be aversive (e.g., physical exertion and caloric restriction). 
However, treatment adherence provides critical health benefits in the future, allowing 
patients with T2D to halt or reverse disease progression and avoid T2D-related 
complications (e.g., renal disease or diabetic retinopathy). Thus, successful 
management of T2D requires one’s present behavior to be guided by [CONTACT_603134]. Unfortunately, accumulating evidence indicates that individuals with T2D 
and those at risk for this disease rapi[INVESTIGATOR_603108] (3, 4), a phenomenon 
known as delay discounting). Moreover, within diabetic and prediabetic populations, 
we and others have shown that high rates of delay discounting are associated with 
poor treatment adherence and clinical outcomes (3, 4, 5). These data indicate that 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_603109] T2D through 
a mechanism in which the health benefits of treatment adherence are too delayed to 
motivate present behavior. Thus, we believe delay discounting serves as a 
therapeutic target in T2D, in which improving valuation of the future will improve 
treatment adherence and, in turn, improve health outcomes such as glycemic control 
and body weight. 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681] (EFT) is a form of prospection that involves mental 
simulation of events that might occur in one’s future (6). EFT to some extent is an 
innate human ability that guides decision-making (e.g., simulating the experience of 
an upcoming job interview or social event); however, populations who discount the 
future rapi[INVESTIGATOR_603110], considering the future infrequently and 
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 5 -  
(13FEB2018) demonstrating low-quality EFT content (e.g., fewer contextual and sensory details). 
Thus, EFT interventions are designed to remediate this deficit and reduce bias 
toward immediate gratification by [CONTACT_603135]-quality 
EFT content and prompting them to engage in EFT frequently. Prior laboratory-based 
research by [CONTACT_603136] a wide range of maladaptive health behaviors and outcomes, 
including overeating (7), food purchasing (8), and weight control in overweight and 
obese populations (9).  
 
These therapeutic effects suggest that EFT may be used to reduce the bias for 
immediate gratification observed in T2D, and thus improve valuation of the long-term 
outcomes associated with treatment adherence. However, little research has 
examined the efficacy of EFT in the real world. This gap in knowledge presents a 
challenge to our understanding of the etiology and treatment of this disease. 
Therefore, our goal is to leverage prior extensive research to engage our behavioral 
target, delay discounting, to develop a clinical intervention for T2D. In pursuit of our 
goal, our objective in this study is to develop a practical, remotely delivered EFT 
intervention to improve delay discounting and treatment adherence in T2D and, in so 
doing, improve management of T2D. 
 
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_798687] behavioral treatment (BT), including 
lifestyle coaching, dietary and activity education, and  daily self-monitoring. 
Participants assigned to an EFT+BT group will also be asked to generate vivid, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_603111]-based prompts daily to engage in EFT in the natural 
environment with the assistance of a study website. Participants assigned to a BT 
alone group will not receive EFT, but will be asked to access the study website and 
answer questions about their experience with the same frequency as the EFT group 
in order to control for use of the technology, effort, attention, and experimenter 
contact. We will assess outcome measures both during and immediately after the 
intervention, as well as at a 6-month follow-up session (approximately 2 months 
following the end of the intervention). This will allow us to estimate both short- and 
long-term effects changes in behavior, weight, and glycemic control 
 
Specific Aim [ADDRESS_798688] that EFT may be 
implemented with high treatment fidelity in clinical settings and is more likely to be 
disseminated among treatment providers and adopted by [CONTACT_1962].

19. Objectives: State the research hypothesis or the question that the research will answer. List the research 
objectives and expected outcomes. A primary outcome or objective must be identified . After the 
statement of the primary objective, secondary objectives may be listed. Objectives should be simple and 
specific. 
 
We hypothesize that participants assigned to the EFT group will show reductions in 
delay discounting and glycemic control (primary outcomes), as well as improvements in 
dietary, weight, and glycemic control and medication adherence (secondary outcomes). 
If similar behavioral and health changes are also observed for the BT control group, we 
hypothesize that these changes will be relatively greater for the EFT group. We also 
hypothesize that participants in both groups will rate the intervention as effective and 
easy to use, although participants in the EFT group will rate the intervention as more 
effective.  
 
20. Study Design: Give a description of the research design including use of placebo, randomization and an 
explanation of what is experimental. Include type of study: descriptive, retrospective, cross-sectional, 
longitudinal, prospective observational, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], experimental (controlled or non-controlled) or pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. 
 
This is a randomized control trial in which we randomly and experimentally assign 
participants to either an EFT or control group and examine the impact of that 
assignment on study outcomes. All participants will also receive access to a lifestyle 
intervention, case management, and self-monitoring.  
 
21. Study Population: Describe the subject population, including age, gender, ethnic characteristics and health 
status. State the inclusion/exclusion criteria along with how this was determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]. Please state 
whether pregnant women, children, or other vulnerable groups will be included or excluded.  Provide 
rationale for using or excluding special populations.  State the number of subjects or subject records 
necessary to complete the research. 
 
We will enroll up to 150 patients with type 2 diabetes (N  = 54, plus addition to 
account for screen failure following an initial screening session, possible dropout,

-   abnormal glucose related to medications (e.g. atypi[INVESTIGATOR_603113]) 
-   prior participation in similar studies: Individuals who have recently participated in 
a laboratory study using similar methods may also be excluded.     
22. Methodology: List all activities or procedures that will be performed (pre-treatment tests and medications, 
tests and medications used during therapy, diagnostic tests, x-rays, lab tests, questionnaires and other forms, 
interviews, chart reviews etc.) Describe how, when and where research activities will be administered and 
analyzed.  Distinguish any standard processes from those that are research.   Please describe 
activities/procedures in a step-by-step chronological order. State the length of time subjects will be in the 
study and the expected amount of time required for each study visit or activity. 
 
Individuals who are likely eligible based on the online screening questionnaire (see 
Appendix A: pre-screening questionnaire) will be invited to attend a lab session. 
After providing informed consent at the lab session, participants' blood HbA1c, 
height, and weight will be measured, as well as provide demographic, health, and 
medication information, and complete delay discounting and food purchase tasks. 
Participants who are verified to be eligible from lab-based and online screening, will 
continue with the remainder of the study and will be randomly assigned to either an 
EFT+BT group or BT control group. Those who are deemed ineligible at this stage 
(e.g., due to low HbA1C) will be provided with prorated compensation and informed 
that they do not qualify.  If participants are determined to be eligible, they will be 
given a detailed orientation of what will be expected of them during the study, 
including tasks they need to complete, recording food consumption and activity 
levels, and frequency of visits to our lab.  
 
Eligible participants will then initiate further study procedures, consisting of: 1) 
laboratory assessment sessions, 2) physical activity assessments, 3) case 
management meetings, 4) daily self-monitoring of diet, weight, and activity, and 5) 
EFT or control engagement.  The intervention will last approximately from Weeks 0-
16, with an additional follow-up assessment at Week 24). 
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 8 -  
(13FEB2018)  
-Laboratory Assessment Sessions (Weeks 0, 8, 16, and 24) 
At assessment sessions, we will collect measures of blood HbA1c, blood pressure, 
height, and weight. Participants will also complete delay discounting tasks, food 
purchase tasks, and complete other study questionnaires (e.g., demographics).  
 
-Physical Activity Assessments (Weeks 0, 8, and 16).  
Participants will be provided with an Actigraph accelerometer for use during the 
study and instructed how to properly wear it. At each assessment (Weeks 0, 6, and 
16), participants will be asked to wear the accelerometer for a continuous 7-day 
period. Although these assessments are scheduled to take place during Weeks 0, 8, 
and 16, the 7-day period may occur during adjacent weeks, in whole or in part, to 
facilitate scheduling. After the 7-day period of Actigraph wear, participants will be 
asked to return the device until the next assessment or at the end of the study.   
 
-24-hour Dietary Recalls (Weeks 0, 8, and 16) 
On three days during approximately the same period that participants wear the 
Actigraph, participants will be asked to complete 24-hour diet recalls using the 
Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24). 
Participants may complete these recalls online.  
 
-Case management meetings (Weeks 0-16). 
All participants in both groups will  attend weekly (during approximate Weeks 1-8) 
and bi-monthly (during approximate Weeks 8-16) meetings with a case manager. 
These meetings will occur over the phone, unless the participant prefers to visit the 
laboratory.  At these meetings, participants will be provided general information on 
healthy diet, physical activity and medication adherence. Participants will also be 
provided instruction regarding a number of different healthy habits for patients with 
type 2 diabetes, including: 1) The Traffic Light Diet, which utilizes RED, YELLOW, 
and GREEN labels for food to guide participants toward the goal of consuming low 
energy dense, low glycemic, high nutrient dense foods; 2) the Traffic Light Activity 
Program, which also utilizes RED, YELLOW and GREEN labels for different levels of 
caloric expenditure, 3) a variety of behavioral techniques, including meal planning 
and 4) use of EFT or the control condition. Participants will be provided with 
educational reading materials for each of these topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], be asked to read these 
materials in between meetings, and be asked to complete quizzes to assess mastery 
(see Appendix B: Healthy Habits Manual + Quizzes). These materials will most often 
be provided in Qualtrics software, but may also be provided in paper form.  
These meetings will also review information about weight loss and maintenance, 
engage in problem solving for participants who are struggling with behavior change, 
behavior change techniques, and diet and activity self-monitoring, and other topi[INVESTIGATOR_603114]. The case manager will also provide 
instruction for using either EFT for behavior change for the EFT+BT group, as well 
as how to access the study website for the BT control group. 
 
At the end of the intervention period (approximately Week 16), case management 
meetings will be discontinued. However, participants will retain access to 
educational materials in Qualtrics through Week 24. 
  
-EFT/Control engagement (Weeks 3-16).  
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 9 -  
(13FEB2018) Beginning in Week 2, participants will be randomly assigned to either the EFT+BT or 
BT control groups. Participants in the EFT+BT group will be asked to generate 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_603115]’s effect 
(Daniel et al., 2013). Participants will list and describe events for different time 
periods. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_603116] (e.g., 
vacations, weddings, parties, health goals, etc.). EFT participants will list positive 
future events they are looking forward to and list events that could happen at 
different general future time points (e.g., 1 month, 2-6 months, 7-12 months). 
Participants will also create text-based cues for each event, which will consist of 
descriptions of the future event (e.g., "In about 6 months, I am attending my sister's 
wedding in Montana. I am enjoying the crisp air and getting to see my family again."). 
In contrast, the BT control group will not generate these events. 
For the remainder of the intervention, participants in both groups will be sent text-
based prompts via cell phone to access the study website (built in Qualtics survey 
software). Once accessed, the study website will guide EFT+BT participants to 
engage in EFT by [CONTACT_603137]. Brief questions may also be presented asking 
participants to describe their study experience (e.g., "Have you encountered any diet 
or activity challenges today?"). Participants in the BT control group will only be 
prompted to access the study website to answer these questions. 
 
Experimenters will train participants in both groups on how to access the study 
website from their cell phone or alternative internet accessible device (e.g. laptop, 
tablet, desktop computer), as well as how to pay attention to and think about the 
cues, and how to adhere to the study’s expectations for utilizing the cues (EFT+BT 
group only). Participants may be prompted several times a day to access the website 
and, for the EFT+BT group, instructed to use their cues any time that need to, 
especially around eating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
 
At the end of the intervention period (approximately Week 16), participants will retain 
access to educational and other materials in Qualtrics through Week 24. However, 
participants will not be provided with prompts to access these materials during this 
period and will not be required to use the website. 
 
-Diet, activity, and weight self-monitoring (Weeks 1-16).  
Participants will be taught how to record food, drink, exercise, and at home weight 
measurements in MyFitnessPal (see Appendix C: Study Websites). MyFitnessPal is a 
smartphone and web based app that tracks diet and exercise and can record the 
number of calories, macro and micronutrients consumed. Participants will be asked 
to use MyFitnessPal for self-monitoring throughout the study, recording the amount 
and types of food they eat and activity they engage in, as well as their weights. User 
accounts will be created for participants and will not include any identifying 
information. 
 
At the end of the intervention period (approximately Week 16), participants may 
retain access to MyFitnessPal through Week 24 to continue self-monitoring of diet, 
exercise, and weight. However, participants will not be required to use this software 
during this period.

23. Data Collection:  Describe below the data collection methods and how data be compi[INVESTIGATOR_554597]. 
Attach a copy of your data collection tool or spreadsheet listing exactly what data is to be gathered during 
this research study.  If all data is retrospective, please state date range from which data will be collected and 
note that data must be in existence at time of submission of this application. 
 
All protected health information will be stored on a password-protected spreadsheet 
on RedCap provided through Carilion Clinic and linked only to subjects through a 
subject ID number.    
 
Additional de-identified study data will be collected and stored using Qualtrics 
survey software. These data will be linked to the participants through their subject ID 
(in RedCap). 
 
These de-identified study data include the following measures, which may also be 
found in the attached appendix (see Appendix D: Study Measures). 
 
--Demographic variables and health behavior data.  Race/ethnicity, household 
income, and educational level will be assessed at baseline using a survey-based 
questionnaire. Participants will also be asked about their health and related 
behaviors (e.g., mental health, medical history, financial behaviors, and food 
consumption.) 
 
--Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale. This 22-item self-report scale screens for the 
presence and severity of symptoms associated with anorexia nervosa, bulima 
nervosa, and binge-eating disorder assess. Participants who provide scores 
consistent with an eating disorder will be provided with referrals to the National 
Eating Disorder's Helpline ([PHONE_12512]), local resources, and/or will be counseld to 
speak with their personal physician.  
 
--Weight, height, BMI.  Participants’ weight will be assessed using a digital scale.  
Height measurements will also be collected.  On the basis of height and weight, BMI 
is calculated according to the following formula: (BMI=kg/m2).  
 
--Blood HbA1c. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) will be measured using the Alere Affinion 
system. 
 
--Blood Pressure. Blood pressure will be measured in triplicate using an automated 
blood pressure device by [CONTACT_21724]. The latter two readings will be 
averaged.   
 
--Dietary restraint. Participants will complete the three-item "Dietary Restraint" 
portion of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) (Stunkard & Messick, 1985), 
a validated instrument to detect dietary restraint (Allison, Kalinsky, & Gorman, 1992). 
 
--Treatment effectiveness and ease of use.  Participants will rate multiple 
components of the intervention (e.g., EFT prompts, self-monitoring) on dimensions 
of perceived effectiveness and ease of use using 5-point Likert scales.   
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 11 -  
(13FEB2018)  
--Delay discounting. Participants will complete hypothetical delay discounting tasks 
for different commodities (e.g. delayed money, weight loss). These tasks assess 
preference between a small, immediately available reward (e.g., $50 now) and a 
larger, delayed reward (e.g., $100 in 6 months) across multiple trials and delays (e.g., 
1 day through 25 years). This task reveals how the subjective value of a reward 
decreases with increases delay. The steepness of the discounting curve, estimated  
by [CONTACT_603138] k, provides a measure of delay discounting.  
 
--Medication adherence. Adherence to oral glucose-lowering medication (e.g., 
Metformin) will be assessed by [CONTACT_17588] a self-report questionnaire and by [CONTACT_603139] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]). In the self-report questionnaire, participants will complete a 
questionnaire in which they report how often they have taken their prescribed 
medication in the recent past. In the direct observation assessment, participants will 
be asked to bring their prescription bottles to both baseline and follow-up visits. 
Remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_603118]: 
(quantity dispensed – remaining)/(quantity prescribed per day * days since last 
refill))*100, yielding a measure of percent adherence.   
 
--Relative reinforcing efficacy of food. Hypothetical food purchase tasks will assess 
the relative reinforcing efficacy of a range of foods. In this task, participants report 
the hypothetical quantity of foods they would purchase to consume across a range 
of prices (e.g., $0.01 - $30 per serving). 
 
--Dietary intake. Diet will be assessed by [CONTACT_6270]-reporting using the Automated Self-
Administered 24-hour Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA-24) 
 
--Corsi block tappi[INVESTIGATOR_91989]. In this test of working memory, blocks are presented on a 
computer screen, which light up one at a time in random order and in sequences of 
increasing length. After each presentation, participants attempt to reproduce the 
patterns shown. 
 
--Physical activity. Physical activity will be measured using an Actigraph 
accelerometer.  Participants will complete three Actigraph assessments during the 
study, with each assessment lasting 7 days. Total activity counts and activity in the 
moderate to vigorous (MVPA) and vigorous (VPA) ranges, among other measures, 
will be estimated.  
 
--Patient Health Questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses frequency of depressive 
symptoms. 
 
 
24. Statistical Analysis:  State how qualitative and/or quantitative data will be analyzed. This must include a 
statement from a statistician that there is sufficient power to determine the primary study outcome or 
objective. Other outcomes may be listed as secondary and descriptive. If this is a proof of concept or 
feasibility study that includes limited efficacy testing, there must be a statistician statement that the 
appropriate design is in place to determine whether an intervention should be recommended for broader 
efficacy testing. If a study is meant to be solely descriptive, then results apply only to the sample being 
studied and conclusions cannot be drawn about the larger population; therefore, the primary outcome or 
objective must be limited in scope. 
 
 
Sample size justification:  
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 12 -  
(13FEB2018)  
We propose a total sample size N = [ADDRESS_798690], our prior laboratory-
based data on effects of EFT on delay discounting and ad-libitum food intake and on 
effects of remotely delivered EFT on dietary intake and BMI revealed generally 
“large” effect sizes (f > .40). However, due to the uncertainty with which similarly 
large effect sizes would be observed for each of the broad range of additional 
measures used in the present study (e.g., medication adherence), we chose to power 
the proposed study for a more conservative, “medium” effect size of f = .25. Using 
this effect size, our power analysis indicated 54 total participants would be required 
based on an ANOVA model with group (EFT/control) as a between-subjects factor, 
time as a within-subjects factor, as well a group x time interaction. This analysis was 
performed in G*Power 3.1, a type 1 error rate of α = 0.05, correlation between 
repeated measures of .50, 95% statistical power. This provides 95% power to detect 
effects of EFT on lab-based measures assessed at baseline and follow-up 
assessments (e.g., HbA1c, BMI).  
 
Data analysis: 
We will use repeated measures ANOVA to examine changes in delay discounting, 
glycemic control, dietary intake, physical activity, medication adherence, BMI, and 
body composition (Specific Aim 1), as well as acceptability of the intervention 
(Specific Aim 2) in subjects who are randomly assigned to EFT and control 
conditions. Covariates will be included, as appropriate, including gender and 
socioeconomic status.  
We will test for attrition bias by [CONTACT_603140]. We will use intention to treat methods, and include all 
randomized subjects. We have a rigorous retention plan but expect up to 15% 
attrition. We will use maximum likelihood-based procedures to impute missing data. 
This approach is associated with more accurate parameter estimates than other 
approaches (e.g., last-observation carried forward), and is appropriate even when 
missing data are not missing at random

SECTION  IV: RISKS AND BENEFITS 
 
25. Summarize the possible risks to subjects and how they have been minimized in the study design. Include risk 
of psychosocial harm (e.g., emotional distress, embarrassment, breach of confidentiality), economic harm 
(e.g., loss of employment or insurability, loss of professional standing or reputation, loss of standing within 
the community) and legal jeopardy (e.g., disclosure of illegal activity or negligence), as well as known side 
effects of study medication, if applicable, and risk of pain and physical injury. Define the level of risk (minimal 
risk, risk but with potential benefit to patient, risk but no benefit to patient). Describe any procedures that will 
be used to prevent or minimize risks or discomforts. Note: Most studies create at least a small risk of breach 
of confidentiality or privacy. 
 
Overall, the risks of study participation are minimal. Participants will be informed of 
the risks associated with the study.   
 
In subjects who are enrolled with an A1c between ~8% and 9.9%, an A1c over 10% 
will trigger a notification of their physician or appropriate medical referral.  In 
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 13 -  
(13FEB2018) subjects who are enrolled with an A1c >= 10%, any [ADDRESS_798691] other medical care provided at any healthcare facility.  
 
Participants might feel uncomfortable disclosing some personal information such as 
medical history. Participants might experience adverse effects associated with 
changes in diet, including feeling hungry, fatigue, or headache. 
 
Participants may, if they are on sulfonylurea or glinide medications, experience 
symptoms associated with hypoglycemia.  Given that insulin use is an exclusion for 
this study, this is likely to be an uncommon and mild clinical issue.  Participants will 
be instructed to discuss the possibility of hypoglycemia with their treating physician 
and the case managers will educate participants about hypoglycemic reactions and 
advise those on hypoglycemic medications to carry an additional source of ready 
sugar. 
 
Participants may experience possible discomfort from blood glucose testing (e.g, 
momentary pain, skin irritation).    
 
To protect confidentiality, we will use only ID numbers and keep all data in in locked 
offices and/or password-protected databases. Any data sharing between sites will 
involve de-identified data only and files will be encrypted or password protected. 
These screening, monitoring, and confidentiality procedures have been in effect for 
more than [ADDRESS_798692] of the study kept secret from the subjects, such as the full 
purpose of the study? 
 
  Yes            No           
 
 If yes, describe the deception involved and the debriefing procedures:       
 
29. Describe any direct benefit to individual subjects, to the group of individuals with the disease process you are 
researching, and/or to society based on scientific knowledge gained. Explain how the potential benefits 
offered by [CONTACT_603142]. (Please note: payments, gifts, or other free services given as a 
token for participation are not benefits, but instead are classified as compensation.) 
 
Participants may benefit from possible weight loss and improved glycemic control.    
 
SECTION  V: RECRUITMENT  
 
30. Number of Subjects/Enrollment Goal. The enrollment goal must match the number of subjects needed to 
meet the primary outcome.  If this is a retrospective record review, this figure is the number of records that 
will be used for analysis. Prior IRB approval must be given to exceed the enrollment goal. 
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 14 -  
(13FEB2018)  
Locally:  Up to 150 enrolled, (N = 54 target completion goal, plus additional if 
necessary to account for possible dropout, screen failure, etc.)     At all Sites:  up to 150  
 
***If this study is a retrospective record review only, you may skip to Section VII*** 
 
31. Will subjects receive any compensation or gifts to participate?  
 
  Yes           No            N/A 
 
 If yes, specify payment amount, how it will be prorated and how payment will be made: Participants 
may receive up to $300 for completion of all study procedures, as follows.  
 
 Assessment Session 1 (Week 0): $20  
 Assessment Session 2 (Week 8): $30  
 Assessment Session 3 (Week 16): $35  
 Assessment Session 4 (Week [ADDRESS_798693]-intervention): $40  
 Physical Activity and Diet Assessments 1-3 (Weeks 0, 8, and 16): $20 per 
assessment week ($60 total possible). These will occur outside the laboratory. At 
each assessment, participants will be asked to wear the Actigraph accelerometer 
to measure physical activity for a period of seven days. On three of those days, 
participants will also be asked to complete the ASA-24 dietary recall 
questionnaire online.  
 Brief Online Assessments (Weeks 3, 9, and 15). $5 per assessment ($15 total 
possible). Participants will be asked to complete brief online assessments (e.g., 
delay discounting, food purchasing) outside of the laboratory. EFT+BT 
participants will also be asked to complete an EFT event/cue-generation exercise.  
 Participants will also receive an additional bonus at Week 24 of $100 for 
completing 90% or more of all assessment sessions and at-home assessments 
(Actigraph, brief online assessments, and diet recalls).  The magnitude of this 
bonus was chosen in order to motivate attendance at the follow-up assessments 
for the majority of participants and thus minimize the occurrence of missing data, 
including from those participants who may have been less successful in the 
intervention or follow-up period.  
 To allow for payments that are both convenient and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_44275], we may pay 
participants with reloadable prepaid cards through Greenphire ClinCard 
(www.greenphire.com), an FDIC-insured payment provider that specializes in 
clinical trial stipend payments that comply with IRB privacy regulations and 
considerations. At the beginning of the study, the participant will receive a 
prepaid MasterCard debit card that can be used anywhere that accepts 
MasterCard. As payments are earned in the course of the study, additional funds 
will be added to the account for that participant. Funds are immediately available 
when added and participants can check their balance as desired. This system will 
allow frequent, immediately available payments. Payments may also be made via 
check or cash, however remote debit card payments and checks will be used 
most often.  
 Compensation will be prorated.  
 To minimize barriers to participation, participants may also be provided with  
travel compensation in addition to the amounts above if they live outside of 
Roanoke or if travel to FBRI from within Roanoke is prohibitive to participation. 
Travel compensation, if provided, will be calculated using an hourly rate equal to 
the US minimum wage.

Carilion Clinic personnel will conduct a data pull of potentially eligible patients from participating 
Carilion Family and Community Medicine clinics in the greater Roanoke Metropolitan area. An 
additional data pi[INVESTIGATOR_603119]. Data pulls will use the inclusion criteria 
of age≥ 18, and may include BMI,  HbA1c, prescribed glucose-lowering medications, as well as ICD-[ADDRESS_798694] removal of any patient from the recruitment process. The 
data pull will use the exclusion criteria of no telephone number and patient stipulation of “Do Not 
Contact” as indicated in the medical record. The data pull will result in a list of potentially eligible 
patients, which will be provided to the PI. Identifying information in the data pull will consist of 
potentially eligible patients’ names, addresses, and phone numbers. {

39. If potential subjects are patients of Carilion Clinic, please check the appropriate scenario: 
 
  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_603154] a member   
of his/her treatment personnel or by [CONTACT_5657]/her Carilion research personnel. Potential subjects will be  
      assured that their decision will not affect their treatment or care or relationship with the treating clinician.  
    *Submit letter, email, or phone script (if applicable) using appropriate IRB template. 
 
  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_603155].   * Submit letter using appropriate IRB template.

(13FEB2018) 40. Describe what will be said to potential subjects to introduce them to the research. If an investigator has 
direct authority over potential subjects who are students, medical residents or employees, then explain how 
recruitment will avoid undue influence. For example, someone from the research team who does not have 
direct authority will make the initial contact [CONTACT_603160] a decision not to participate 
in the research will not affect grades or job evaluations. Submit any letter, email, phone or other recruitment 
script that will be used. 
 
Please see attached recruitment letter.  
 
STEP 3: SCREENING OF POTENTIAL SUBJECTS   
To “screen” a potential subject refers to additional information that will be collected or activities that will take 
place after he or she has been identified and contact[CONTACT_603161].  
This could include asking questions to a potential subject to determine whether he or she meets eligibility criteria. 
Note: To comply with HIPAA regulations, only the minimum necessary protected health information may be 
collected at this time. This means only questions relating to the inclusion and exclusion criteria may be asked. 
 
41. Please describe the screening process for your study. Please include whether you plan to ask potential 
subjects to do anything or answer questions prior to signing an informed consent document. For example: 
patients will answer questions about their medical history, be expected to come to the first screening visit 
after fasting, stop taking medications, change diet, etc.    
 
The screening process will occur via a website or in person. The screening will ask 
about age, gender, pregnancy status, and other demographic and health information 
related to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be scheduled for an informed 
consent session that will require no change in routine behavior.  
 
Potential participants will be asked to provide a unique study code during screening 
so that PHI is not collected/stored in the same database as their answers to 
screening questions. Study personnel will inform participants that the screening 
information they provide will be kept confidential and not shared with anyone 
outside of the study team. 
 
Screening data will be collected online using RedCAP (for PHI) and Qualtrics. Stored 
screening data will not include any HIPAA identifiers. Names and other identifying 
information of patients identified through query of Carilion Medical Records will be 
stored in a secure share on a Carilion portal/server. 
 
Carilion patients will be recruited through direct mailings, including a link to the 
screening questionnaire, to adults [ADDRESS_798695] our research center via phone or email or in person, or 
access the screening questionnaire directly.

50. Does the research exclude pregnant women?       Yes            No 
 
If you marked No above, then please affirm the following by [CONTACT_603167]: 
 
  Preclinical studies and clinical studies have been conducted and provide data for assessing potential risks 
 to pregnant women and fetuses, or it is not scientifically appropriate to do this. 
  The risk to the fetus is caused solely by [CONTACT_603168]/or fetus; or, if there is no such prospect of benefit, the risk to the fetus is 
 minimal and the purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge which 
 cannot be obtained by [CONTACT_86416]. 
  Any risk is the least possible for achieving the objectives of the research. 
  The research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the pregnant woman and/or fetus, or no benefit 
 for the woman nor fetus and risk to the fetus is minimal and the purpose of the research is the 
 development of important biomedical knowledge that cannot be obtained by [CONTACT_86416]. 
  Each individual providing consent will be fully informed regarding the reasonably foreseeable impact of 
 the research on the fetus or neonate. 
  No inducements, monetary or otherwise, will be offered to terminate a pregnancy. 
  Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in any decisions as to the timing, method or 
 procedures used to terminate a pregnancy. 
  Individuals engaged in the research will have no part in determining the viability of a neonate. 
 
Please affirm the following by [CONTACT_603169] : 
 
  If the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit solely to the fetus, then the consent of the 
 pregnant woman and the father will be obtained (father’s consent need not be obtained if he is 
 unavailable, incompetent, or temporarily incapacitated; or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest). 
  For children who are pregnant, assent and permission will be obtained. 
 
51. If you plan to enroll subjects that may be cognitively impaired, describe how you plan to assess decision 
making capacity prior to consent: N/A 
 
 Will consent be obtained from a surrogate decision-maker for incompetent subjects?

 SECTION  VII: INFORMED CONSENT 
 
Carilion IRB Application         - 20 -  
(13FEB2018)  Is the informed consent document the only record linking the subject and the research, and is the 
principal risk the potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality?   
 
  Yes            No   
 
If yes, you must ask the participant if they want documentation linking them to the research, and the 
subject’s wishes shall govern.         
 
 Does the research involve greater than minimal risk or any procedure for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context? 
 
  Yes            No 
 
 Will you provide the subject with a written statement regarding the research? 
  Yes            No 
 
 Are the subjects or their legally authorized representatives members of a distinct cultural group or 
community in which signing forms is not the norm, and is there is an appropriate alternative mechanism 
for documenting that informed consent was obtained?  
  Yes            No 
 
 
54. Describe the process of obtaining informed consent, parental permission, and/or assent from the subject in 
detail (ex: who, when, where, how), and how this process will be documented.  
Patients interested in participating will be provided with the written consent form during 
their scheduled visit to the FBRI or CRC.  They will also be given time in a quiet room in 
the laboratory to read and consider the form. Consenting personnel will review each 
element of the written consent form with the potential participant. The potential 
participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions and will have as much time as 
they need to decide whether they would like to participate in the study. They will be 
encouraged to speak with whomever they wish before making this decision. Personnel 
will reiterate that the patient may choose to decline participation in the study at that 
time or at any time thereafter without consequence. The potential participant and 
person obtaining consent will sign the consent form after the potential participant 
verbally states that s/he understands the conditions of the study. Patients will also be 
offered the opportunity to take home the consent form, consider it more carefully, and 
provide informed consent (if they choose) at a later date.

  REDCap  (contact [EMAIL_11508]  to discuss use of REDCap). If all data, including the code 
link, will be stored in REDCap, skip to #82. 
 
82. The standard at Carilion to protect identifiable data used in research is to use a code and link system.  Two 
files should be kept in two separate secure locations.  One file should use a unique code for each subject in 
connection with any sensitive or health information.  The other file (the link) associates the unique code with 
subject identifiers (e.g. name, medical record number). Please describe how you will store data using the 
options below. 
 
  Retrospective Record Review Research Only:  The master list will contain direct subject identifiers 
such as name [CONTACT_603185] a unique subject code. It will be stored separately from the coded 
research data set at all times. The research data set will not include any HIPAA identifiers with the 
exception of a date. 
  Prospective Collection of Data , including surveys or collection of new data: While initial collection of 
research data may contain identifying information, it must be stored using a code linked to the subject’s 
identity using a master list, or will include only anonymous or de-identified data . All HIPAA identifiers will 
be stripped from the initial research data collection data tools and replaced with a unique subject code. 
  Prospective Collection of Sensitive Data , including surveys or collection of new data: Research data 
 will be linked to identifiers by a unique subject code at all times. The code will be linked to a master list 
 that contains identifying information. The master list and coded research data will be stored in separate 
 locations.   
 
83. Please describe how you plan to protect identifying information from improper use and disclosure by 
[CONTACT_603175]. 
 
a) Who will have access to identifiers?  Trained study team personnel  
b) How will you limit access to the identifiers?  Identifiers will be stored separately on a 
password protected master list in Carilion Red Cap or on a Carilion server.  
 
84. When will study files, including informed consent documents, study documents, and the code link with 
identifiers be destroyed?   
Please note that you must retain research records for the greater of:

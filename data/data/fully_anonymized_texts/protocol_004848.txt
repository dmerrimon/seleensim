 3 PRECIS     
 
Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are life-threatening bone marrow 
disorders. For SAA patients, long term survival can be achieved with immunosuppressive treatment. 
However, of those patients treated with immunosuppr essive therapy, one quarter to one third will not 
respond, and about 50% of responders will relapse.   
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from either HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor  
cures about 70% of patients with SAA and 30-60% of patients with MDS. Unfortunately, most patients 
with these disorders are not suitable candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) due to 
advanced age or lack of a histocompatible donor. For such patients, transplantation using unrelated cord 
blood (UCB) has been shown to be a reasonable alternative transplant strategy. The advantage to UCB 
transplant is the ease and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16142], requirement of less than perfect HLA match, and lower 
rates of graft versus host disease compared to mismatched bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell 
transplants.  The major disadvantage of UCB transplantation in adults is the limited number of nucleated 
cells contained within the cord unit resulting in prolonged neutropenia and failure of engraftment which 
contributes to infection and transplant related mortal ity (TRM). In order to harness the advantage of UCB 
availability and to overcome the disadvantage of delayed neutrophil recovery, we propose to test whether co-administration of unrelated umbilical cord blood and a relatively low number of highly purified 
haploidentical peripheral blood CD34+ cells from a related donor might promote rapid engraftment and  
reduce TRM secondary to prolonged neutropenia associated with conventional UCBT.  
 
This research protocol is therefore designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of co-infusion of 
unrelated umbilical cord blood and haploidentical CD34+ cells from a related donor following non-
myeloablative conditioning for neutropenic patients wi th SAA or MDS with refa ctory anemia (RA) that 
has proven to be refractory to medical therapy.  Subjects will receive a novel non-myeloablative 
immunosuppressive conditioning regimen of cyclopho sphamide, fludarabine, horse ATG and one dose of 
total body irradiation (200cGy) followed by [CONTACT_389666]. The haploidentical stem cell 
product will be T-cell depleted and enriched for CD 34+ cells using the Miltenyi CliniMacs system. To 
reduce TRM secondary to prolonged neutropenia asso ciated with conventional UCB transplantation, 
haploidentical CD34+ stem cells will be co-infused with a single UCB unit (serologically matched at t 
4/6 HLA loci).   
 The primary endpoint is donor engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42 (defined as an ANC of >[ADDRESS_488225], or both combined)
.  Secondary endpoints will include standard transplant outcome 
variables such as non-hematological toxicities, inci dence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD, and 
relapse of disease. We will also evaluate ANC recovery (ANC > 500 cells/ Pl) at day 22,  and 100 day and 
200 day treatment related mortality (TRM) of this novel transplant approach.  Health related quality of 
life will also be assessed pre-transplant, [ADDRESS_488226] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO)

2.0 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Aplastic Anemia (AA) 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_488231] that the ultimate mechanism leading to development of bone marrow failure is 
immune-mediated. [1, 2]  Suppression of hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia is likely secondary to 
specific populations of effector T-cells.  Activat ed cytotoxic T-cells expressing HLA-DR, the IL-2 
receptor, and IFN- J are elevated in aplastic anemia patients and localized in the bone marrow.[3-5]  
Hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells are targets for the immune attack by [CONTACT_176727]. The 
effects exerted by [CONTACT_28746] T-lymphocytes are at least in part due to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis 
of hematopoietic progenitor cells; IFN- γ, in addition to its intrinsic inhibitory activity on 
hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, can indu ce over-expression of Fas on target cells.[6, 7] 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_389564], aplastic anemia is now being recognized as a chronic disease 
with frequent flares of the immune process and the need for long-term immunosuppression. High 
resolution V β CDR3 analysis in patients with aplastic anemia shows significantly increas ed 
nonrandom skewing of the V β-chain families of the T cell receptor, suggestive of disease specific 
clonal expansion.[8] 
 
 2.1.[ADDRESS_488232] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 6 2.1.3  Treatment options for aplastic anemia 
 
x Horse antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM ; h-ATG)  is currently approved for the treatment 
of aplastic anemia by [CONTACT_2165].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_9444] h-ATG 
improves bone marrow failure in aplastic anemia is not fully known.  While it is generally 
believed that h-ATG administration leads to de pletion of immune competent cells, its exact 
mechanism of action remains unclear. h-ATG preparations contain a variety of antibodies 
recognizing human T-cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], many directed against activated T-cells or activation 
antigens.[9, 10] After treatment with h-ATG, ci rculating levels of lymphocytes drop to 10% 
pretreatment level through a variety of mechanis ms: Fc receptor complement-dependent lysis, 
opsonization and phagocytosis by [CONTACT_179968]; and immunomodulation leading to long-term depletion via antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and activation-induced 
apoptosis.  Although the decline in circulating levels of lymphocytes is transient, the number 
of activated T -cells is decreased for more prolonged periods of time; this effect is also 
reflected in decreased IFN- γ and possibly TNF pro duction after h-ATG.[11, 12] Tissue 
culture preparations of peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with h-ATG produce 
hematopoietic colony stimulating factors, suggesting a possible stimulatory role in vivo.  h-
ATG binds to numerous other cell types in addition to lymphocytes, including cells of the 
bone marrow.[13-15] The response to h-ATG may be mediated by [CONTACT_389667], although response to h-ATG has not 
correlated with severity or presence of clinical serum sickness.  
 
x Rabbit ATG (Thymoglobulin®; r-ATG)  is similar to h-ATG, except that gamma immune 
globulin is obtained by [CONTACT_389668].  r-ATG contains cytotoxic antibodies directed against antigens expressed on T lymphocytes.  r-ATG has been 
commercially available in Europe since 1985 and is currently licensed in more than 44 
countries and has been used in more than 44,000 patients worldwide. In an Italian multi-center study, 30 aplastic anemia patients who failed h-ATG plus CsA received second line 
treatment with r-ATG and cyclosporine.[16] Overall response, defined as transfusion-
independence was achieved in 23/30 (77%) patients after a median of 95 days, and overall 
survival was 93% with a median follow up of [ADDRESS_488233] been less impressive: three 
partial responses; two late responses occurring more than six months after treatment and therefore of uncertain relationship to therapy; and nine patients without a response; one 
patient died of complications of pancytopenia soon after r-ATG treatment.   Initial treatment 
with r-ATG has also been evaluated. Stein et al used r-ATG in combination with prednisone 
± cyclosporine ± androgens in 57 patients with aplastic anemia, 30 being severe and 27 
moderate.[17] Response occurred in 16 cases (28%), being more frequent in females, those with less than 6 months duration and with severe disease. Eight patients had previously 
received r-ATG and 2 (25%) responded.  
 
x Cyclosporine (CsA)  is a major immunosuppressive drug and probably secondary only to 
corticosteroids in world wide popularity in this  role. In addition to its longstanding use in 
bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], CsA has been widely employed as an immunosuppressive drug in many autoimmune diseases. In contrast to ATG, CsA has a very 
selective inhibitory effect on T lymphocytes, s uppressing early cellular response to antigenic 
and regulatory stimuli. By [CONTACT_389669], it leads to 
reduced T cell proliferation and activation with diminished release of cytokines such as 
interleukin-[ADDRESS_488234] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 7 70-80% and the 5 year survival in responding patients to 80-90%.[18, 19] CsA binds to 
intracellular receptors termed immunophilins, in hibiting in turn the activity of calcineurin, 
which results in the blocking of interleukin-2 production and T cell activation and 
proliferation. In vivo, CsA inhibits the release of IL-2 from activated T-cells and 
consequently decreases T cell proliferation.[20-22] 
 
x Alternative immunosuppressive agents  have been used with debated success. At Johns 
Hopkins, high dose cyclophosphamide without stem cell rescue produced hematologic 
responses in SAA patients similar to those seen with ATG combined with CsA, with no 
relapse or evolution to PNH or myelodysplasia being observed. [23] However, a prospective 
randomized trial conducted at the NHLBI, which compared ATG and cyclosporine to 
cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine, was terminat ed prematurely due to excessive toxicity, 
severe fungal infections and deaths in the group that received cyclophosphamide.[24] In 
contrast to the Hopkins experience, some of our patients relapsed or developed cytogenetic 
abnormalities. [25]  The explanation for the increased toxicity seen in the cyclophosphamide 
treated patients is the serious immunosuppression and resulting neutropenia.  The NIH is 
currently investigating the efficacy of  alemtuzumab (Campath®)  in subjects with MDS and 
SAA who have received no prior ATG based immunosuppressive therapy, in subjects who 
are refractory or had a suboptimal response to a course of horse ATG-based immunosuppression, and in subjects who have responded and relapsed following a prior 
course of ATG or are refractory to prior courses of horse and rabbit ATG.  
 
2.1.4  Transplant options for patients with Aplastic anemia  
 
x HLA- identical related donor transplantation for patients with SAA :  Allogeneic bone 
marrow transplantation from a histocompatible matched sibling is curative therapy in the 
majority of aplastic anemia patients who undergo the procedure.[26-29]
   Survival rates with 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantat ion from a histocompatible sibling have been 
reported to be as high as 90% from a single institution and approximately 70% for registry 
data, which more likely reflects the general experience.[30, 31] 
   
High dose immunosuppression both eliminates active patient immunity that is involved in the 
pathogenesis of aplastic anemia and suppresses the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s immune system to prevent 
rejection of the graft. Cyclophosphamide as a single agent can be used to condition patients 
undergoing HSCT. The addition of ATG to cyclophosphamide conditioning appears to significantly reduce the risk of graft rejection. A report of 39 consecutive patients who 
received cyclophosphamide (total 200mg/kg in four daily doses) and ATG (total 90mg/kg in 
three doses using an HLA matched sibling donor) conditioning for a first transplant from an 
HLA matched sibling donor reported a graft rejection rate of only 5%. The 3 year survival 
rate was 92% compared to the 72% in matched historical controls receiving cyclophosphamide alone.[30]  A more recent series of 81 patients with SAA undergoing this 
transplant approach reported 96% of the patients had sustained engraftment with 88% of 
patients being long term survivors at a median follow up of 9.2 years. [32]  
  
Patients with SAA who are older (i.e. >40 years of age), have failed prior immunosuppressive 
therapy, or who are heavily transfused have a higher risk of graft failure after HSCT. 
Minimizing the numbers of transfusions a nd using irradiated, leukocyte-depleted blood 
products appears to decrease this risk. Improved transfusion practices may be responsible, in 
part, for lower graft failure rates and better transplant outcomes observed in recent years.[27] 
Several strategies have been employed to decrease graft failure. One such approach is the 
addition of radiation, either total body, total lymphoid, or thoraco-abdominal.[33, 34] 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488235] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 8 However, radiation is associated with a high er risk of secondary malignancies [35-38], 
pneumonitis and chronic GVHD. The introduction of fludarabine in combination with 
cyclophosphamide with or without ATG allows for the elimination of irradiation from the 
conditioning regimen and was recently shown to result in excellent engraftment rates, even in 
heavily transfused and alloimmunized patients that have received prior immunosuppressive 
therapy [39-41]  
 
x Matched unrelated donor transplantation for patients with SAA:  Current practice 
guidelines do not recommend transplantation from an alternative donor as first-line treatment. However, only about one third of otherwise eligible transplant candidates will have an HLA-
identical related donor. Alternative donor sources include HLA-mismatched related donors or 
a closely-HLA matched unrelated donors.[39] The probability of survival after unrelated donor transplantation is about half that observed in matched sibling transplants. Therefore, 
HSCT using unrelated donors is reserved for children identified to have a suitably matched 
unrelated donor that have failed a single co urse of immunosuppression or for adults who are 
refractory to multiple courses of ATG +/- alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389565]. Causes
 of 
transplant failure include a higher frequency of graft rejection, regimen-related toxicity 
(because of intensification of the conditioning regimens aimed at preventing rejection), and a 
higher incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) compared with HLA-identical 
sibling transplants. An analysis of 318 matched unrelated donor transplants followed over a 
median period of 5 years from 1988-1998 reported a graft failure rate of 15%, a 48% 
incidence of grade II -IV GVHD and a 5-year survival of 39%[42]. Many conditioning 
regimens for alternative donor transplants incor porate irradiation to faci litate engraftment. A 
prospective multicenter study conducted from 1994-[ADDRESS_488236] determined that 200cGy (in combination 
with cyclophosphamide and ATG) was the minima l effective dose of to tal body irradiation 
required to achieve sustained engraftment without inducing prohibitive toxicity. Graft failure 
occurred in 2%, acute GVHD (grade II –IV) in 70%, chronic GVHD in 52%, and overall 
survival was 61%.[43]  
 
The EBMT-SAA Working Party recently report ed results using a conditioning regimen 
substituting fludarabine for irra diation in 38 related and family mismatched donor transplants; 
graft rejection occurred in 18% with a 2-year survival rate of 73%.[44] 
 
x  Unrelated cord blood transplantation for patients with SAA :   Umbilical cord blood (UCB) 
is also increasingly being used as a source of stem cells, as this allows the transplantation of 
patients without an HLA-matched donor. A group in China treated nine young adults 
suffering from severe AA with umbilical transplants using cyclophosphamide and 
antilymphocyte globulin conditioning.[45] Seven of the nine patients had some level of 
engraftment, evidenced by [CONTACT_389670]. After a median follow-up of 32 months, survival was nearly 80%. Successful complete chimerism was reported in a 
pediatric patient after an umbilical cord graft; stable engraftment was also achieved after 
UCB grafts in children with congenital AA in two other reports. Umbilical cord transplants 
therefore appear to be an option for patien ts with AA who lack a suitable HLA-matched 
donor, but more experience is needed to determ ine the long-term outcome of this approach. 
Transplantation using unrelated cord blood (UCB) has been shown to be a reasonable 
alternative transplant approach for patients with hematological disorders curable by [CONTACT_389671] a stem cell source.  Advantage 
of UCB transplantation include the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16145], the 
requirement for less than a perfect HLA match, and lower rates of graft versus host disease 
associated with HLA mismatching compared to bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488237] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488238] blood transplantation designed 
to better define the role of this stem cell source for subjects requiring unrelated allogeneic transplantation; 34 adult subjects (median ag e 34.5 years) were enrolled. Most of these 
patients had hematological malignancies and were transplanted with a single umbilical cord 
blood unit (containing greater than 10e7 nucleated cells per Kg of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]) after a 
myeloablative conditioning regimen. For the primary end point, survival at 180 days was 
dismally low at 30%. Median time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were unacceptably prolonged at 31 days (range, 13 to 55 days) and 117 days respectively and the primary graft 
failure incidence was 34%. Acute and chronic GVHD were the most common cause of death 
after CBT in this study.[46] 
 
Although increasing the cell dose has been reported to improve engraftment kinetics, it is 
unclear whether higher cord blood cell doses wi ll increase the percentage of subjects who 
will successfully engraft. Whereas doses of < 1.5 x 10
7 total nucleated cells (TNCs) per 
kilogram are associated with a higher incidence of graft failures[47], Rubinstein et al. [48] 
did not detect a decrease in graft failures above a dose of 2.5 x 107 TNCs per kilogram, thus 
suggesting that there may be a threshold dose for successful engraftment. This study and 
previous CBT studies [46, 49-51]indicate that despi[INVESTIGATOR_389566], 
approximately 85% to 90% of subjects undergoing CBT will eventually engraft. 
 
It is now clear that the limited umbilical cord blood (UCB) cell dose is the major factor that 
compromises outcome in adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389567]. Therefore, to augment graft 
cell dose, combinations of 2 partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched UCB units 
were evaluated prospectively in twenty-thr ee patients with high-risk hematological 
malignancies.[52] Engraftment was quicker using this approach, with neutrophil recovery 
occurring at a median of 23 days (range, 15- 41). Such “dual cord” transplants may shorten 
neutropenia compared to transp lantation approaches using a single umbilical cord blood unit, 
but conditioning associated neutropenia of [ADDRESS_488239] transplants as a stem cell 
source in patients with severe aplastic anemia.  
 
2.2 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) 
2.2.1 Pathophysiology of MDS 
The myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematological disorders 
characterized by [CONTACT_389672], multiple re fractory cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia) and morphologic evidence of marrow dysplasia (proliferation of myeloblastic 
leukemia cells). As a result, patients with MDS are at variable risk of progression to acute 
leukemia which is often refractory to standard treatment. These disorders may arise de novo or 
appear years after exposure to potentially mutagenic chemotherapy. The majority of patients with 
myelodysplasia have a hypercellular or normocellular bone marrow.  In a minority of patients, 
less than 15%, a hypocellular bone marrow is found and the abnormality is referred to as 
hypoplastic myelodysplasia.[53]  Hypoplastic MDS bears morphologic similarity to aplastic 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488240] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 10 anemia. In some patients with aplastic anemia who initially respond to immunosuppressive 
therapy, progression to MDS may occur also suggesting that these two entities may share a 
common pathophysiology, T-cell-mediated suppressio n of a primitive bone marrow stem cells.    
 
2.2.2 Cytogenetic abnormalities present in MDS  
 Cytogenetic abnormalities are present in 40-70%  of de novo MDS cases[54-58] . Many times, 
patients may present with cytopenias but minima l or no evidence of marrow dysplasia and a 
diagnosis of MDS is based on abnormal cytogene tics.  Additionally, survival and the risk of 
leukemic transformation can be prognosticated based upon cytogenetic abnormalities.  Deletion 
5q, deletion 20q, or deletion Y, when occurr ing as the only cytogenetic abnormality are 
considered low risk MDS with the most favorable median survival (5.7 years) and lowest risk of 
progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Complex karyotypes are associated with the 
poorest median survival (0.4 years) and greatest risk of progression to AML.  Intermediate 
karyotypes such as trisomy 8 and other abnormalities that are not listed above fall in between 
with a median survival of 1.2 to 3.5 years.[58]

2.2.3 Clinical consequences of MDS 
 
Symptoms that derive from low blood counts include: anemia which leads to fatigue, weakness, 
lassitude, headaches, and in older patients, dyspnea and chest pain. These manifestations are most 
commonly responsible for the clinical presentation. Thrombocytopenia produces mucosal 
bleeding: petechiae of the skin and mucous membra nes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and gum bleeding are frequent 
and early complaints.  Bleeding can be brisk in the presence of accompanying physical lesions, as 
in gastritis and fungal infection of the lungs.  The most feared complication of thrombocytopenia 
is intracranial hemorrhage. Bacterial and fungal infections in the setting of neutropenia are a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality and are often the cause of death in refractory cytopenia

 [ADDRESS_488242] a low risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_389568] 30 months. The majority of these patients die of consequences of 
bone marrow failure or due to iron overload as a result of repeated blood transfusions. The 
median survival of patients presenting with RAEB and RAEB-t is generally shorter than 12 
months.[59]

x Growth factors:   Until recently, most patients were treated only with transfusions and 
growth factors to improve blood counts.  While many people assume that the majority of 
patients die from leukemic transformation, progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
occurs in up to 40% of patients with MDS [60] but an equal proportion of patients die from bleeding or infection resulting from cytopeni as. Additionally, symptoms of anemia, and 
frequent trips to the treating physician’s offi ce for blood and/or platelet transfusions 
significantly impact quality of life.  In low risk MDS patients, erythropoietin provides a 
modest benefit for the treatment of anemia and many studies have shown a superior benefit 
when granulocyte stimulating factor (GCSF) is added to erythropoietin.[61-64] Additionally, 
GCSF alone can stimulate the production of neutrophils to prevent infectious complications 
from long-term neutropenia.[65, 66]  Unfortunately, growth factors work only for a finite period of time and patients eventually succumb to anemia requiring transfusion support and 
prolonged neutropenia.  The prognosis for patients with MDS/AML is very poor with high 
chemotherapy complication rates and a short duration of remission in responders.  
 
x Immunosuppresive therapy:   Indeed, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), the mainstay of non-
transplantation therapy for aplastic anemia, has a role in certain patients with MDS. A report 
from the National Cancer Institute suggests that patients with MDS who are young and who 
have low platelet counts may benefit from a trial of ATG, with response rates as high as 50% 
.[67, 68] Interesting recent findings have added DR15 histocompatibility type as another 
predictor for response to ATG in MDS. [68, 69]Although it was originally thought that only 
patients with hypoplastic MDS would respond, it now seems clear that bone marrow hypoplasia is not a requirement to respond to rabbit or horse ATG, although  patients with 
excess blasts rarely respond
 .[70]Investigators from Prague have shown that about 40% of 
patients with indolent-subtype MDS may respond to cyclosporine[71]. Although a large 
randomized trial testing the utility of ATG in MDS is ongoing, young patients with MDS 
who do not have excess marrow blasts can be considered for a trial of immunosuppression. 
 
x Decitabine and Azacitidine (AzA-CR, 5-AZC):  Azacitidine has been designated an orphan 
product for the use in the treatment of MDS but has shown only a 10-30% response rate.[72, 73]Its use requires close monitoring as cytopenias and central nervous system toxicities 
(lethargy, somnolence, confusion, coma ) are frequent complications. The drug was recently 
licensed and is widely available to those who wish to use it off study. 5-azacytidine, can 
reduce transfusion requirements, delay time to leukemic transformation, and improve quality 
of life  when compared to supportive care.[74]  This trial will not exclude patients who have 
tried and failed Azacitidine, nor does it preclude it s use in patients who have failed treatment.   
 
Decitabine, another hypomethylating agent, has shown to increase survival in patients with 
average and high risk MDS. A study of 170 aver age and high risk MDS patients showed an 
overall response of 17% with a 9% complete response and 13% hematologic response.  In 
this population there was an increased leukemia free progression time.  While overall survival 
is improved with both drugs, some patients are limited in their ability to tolerate these 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488243] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 12 medications secondary to worsening cytopenias.  Additionally, all patients eventually 
progress or die of complications of their disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391].[74] 
 
Revlimid® (Lenalidomide):  Revlimid®, a drug structurally similar to Thalidomide, was 
approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) on December 27, 2005 
for the treatment of low-or-intermediate risk MDS associated with deletion of 5q, a chromosomal (cytogenetic) abnormality, with or  without other cytogenetic abnormalities.[75]  
 
2.2.5 Transplant options for patients with MDS 
 
x Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for MDS.   It is now well established that 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can be cured with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Disease-free survival (DFS) ranges from 29% to 40%, with corresponding 
non-relapse mortality of 37 to 50% with the rate of relapse ranging from 23% to 48% with an 
HLA-identical sibling donor.[76-79] Longer disease duration before transplantation and older 
age is associated with an increased risk of treatment-related death after transplantation, 
particularly in those with life threatening cytopenias, thereby [CONTACT_389673].[80] Outcome of SCT in patients with RAEB and 
RAEBt is less favorable than the outcome in patients with RA(RS), due largely to a higher risk of relapse. The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) 
reported a 5-year actuarial relapse rate of 44% and 52% in 35 RAEB patients and 28 RAEBt 
patients.[81] The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  (FHCRC) reported a 49% relapse 
rate for patients with excess of blasts compared to 4% for patients without marrow blast 
elevations, with actuarial DFS of 31% versus 54%, respectively.[82] 
 
This curative effect has been ascribed to the use of myeloablative chemo-radiotherapy and the 
antileukemic effect of the transplant (the graft-versus-leukemia [GVL] effect). The 
assumption that the intensive myeloablative prep arative regimen is essential for the cure of 
the malignancy went unchallenged until the demons tration by [CONTACT_43569] [83], subsequently 
confirmed by [CONTACT_217392], that donor lymphocytes alone exert a powerful 
antileukemic effect [84] in the context of patients relapsing with myeloid leukemias after 
BMT.[85-88]  This observation has important implications: 
 
o First, it may be possible to cure some hematological malignancies with preparative 
regimens of lower intensity, designed to immunosuppress the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389569].[89]   
o Second, such low-intensity preparative regimens appear to have lower toxicity and 
may make transplantation appropriate in patients where procedural mortality is 
usually prohibitive, including patients with more indolent hematological diseases as 
well as patients with co-morbid diseases and older patients.[90]   
Several groups, including our own, have begun to investigate this approach to improve the applicability and outcome following allogeneic BMT.  Our experience at the NIH has included 
>[ADDRESS_488244] “myeloablative” transplant approach. 
The application of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in MDS has had favorable results. Kröger, et al.[91] reported 37 patients with MDS, who were ineligible for transplants using 
conventional myeloablative conditioning. The reduced intensity conditioning consisted of 
fludarabine, a reduced dosage of busulphan a nd antithymocyte globulin. Overall TRM was 27%, 
with significantly higher mortality in those with poor-risk cytogenetics (75% versus 29%) or 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488245] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 13 with an HLA-matched unrelated donor (45% versus 12%). In total, 32% of patients relapsed, and 
actuarial disease free survival (DFS) at 3 years was 38% with a median follow-up of 20 months. 
A Spanish study showed a TRM of only 5% after transplantation of 37 patients with MDS and 
AML (median age: 57 years) utilizing a regime n of fludarabine and busulphan 10 mg/kg.[92] 
The 1-year progression-free survival was 66% with a corresponding frequency of disease-
progression in patients with and without graf t-versus-host disease (GVHD) of 13% (95% CI, 
4%–34%) and 58% (95% CI, 36% –96%), respectively ( P = 0.008). These results support the 
notion that a graft-versus-MDS/AML response is critical in reducing  the risk of relapse after an 
RIC transplant. However the risk of relapse may be higher using RIC; a recent EBMT study 
reported  a 54% relapse risk for [ADDRESS_488246] ratio (HR) of 6.0 ( p = 0.02) for relapse compared to conventional 
transplantation regimens in a multivariate Cox model.[93]  
 
In the current study, we will only include patients with refractory anemia (RA) orrefractory 
anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) subtypes of MDS who have life-threatening 
neutropenia and who are at a lower risk of relapse with reduced intensity conditioning but are 
not candidates for a transplant utilizing an HLA matched related or unrelated donor.  
 
x Stem cell transplantation using matched unrelated donors  for MDS.  Among 118 patients 
who received a stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor in the EBMT database, DFS at 2 
years, relapse risk and TRM were 28%, 35% and 58%, respectively. The TRM was 
significantly influenced by [CONTACT_654] (younger than 18 years: 40%; 18 –35 years: 61%; older than 
35 years: 81%). Patients with more severe acute GVHD experienced a lower relapse risk, 
suggesting an increased graft-versus-MDS effect in these patients.[94]  
x Stem cell transplantation using unrelated cord blood for MDS. At present, no case series 
reporting outcome of adult patients with MDS receiving unrelated cord blood transplants has 
yet been published. However, two recent retrospective analyses have been published 
comparing transplant outcome in adult patients with a variety of hematological malignancies 
undergoing umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplants versus matched unrelated donor (MUD) 
transplants. In an EBMT analysis of 682 patients undergoing UCB (n=98) vs MUD transplants, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389570] a significantly lower incidence of acute GVHD 
(relative risk [RR] 0.57) with a similar incidence of CGVHD and similar leukemia free 
survival and overall survival.[50]  An IBMTR analysis of 600 adult patients with leukemia 
undergoing transplantation from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) vs a single antigen 
mismatched unrelated donor versus a 1 or 2 antigen mismatched UCB transplant reported long-term leukemia free survival and overall survival to be slightly superior with MUD 
donors.[49] In this analysis, leukemia free survival and overall survival was similar among 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] a single antigen mismatched unrelated donor transplant compared to UCB 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  These and other studies have now defined a clear role of UCB 
transplantation in the treatment of adults with  hematological malignancies who lack an HLA 
matched sibling donor or fully matched unrelated donor. However, graft failure, which is 
most closely associated with patient size, age, and low cord stem cell doses, remains a 
significant problem that limits the applicability of this approach in adults. A number of 
approaches are being developed to overcome the obstacle of low-cell doses in adults, 
including the use of dual cord blood transplants in which UCB grafts are combined from 
different cord donors and the ex vivo  expansion of umbilical cord progenitor cells.  This 
protocol utilizes reduced intensity conditioning followed by [CONTACT_389674]-infusion of haploidentical purified CD34+ cells to expedite neutrophil recovery. If 
successful, this approach could expand the app lication of allogeneic transplantation to a 
greater numbers of patients with MDS.

 [ADDRESS_488248] one HLA-haploidentical mismatched family member (parent, child, or sibling) who is immediately available as a donor. Unfortunately, in full haplotype mismatched transplants, a high 
frequency of alloreactive donor T cells in unmanip ulated grafts exist that recognize mismatched 
MHC antigens, resulting in an extremely high incidence of severe, acute GVHD.[95-97] Although 
extensive T cell depletion prevents GVHD, the rejection rates rise steeply because the balance 
between competing host and donor T cells shifts in favor of the unopposed host-versus-graft reaction.[98, 99] Furthermore, T-cell depletion is as sociated with a greater risk of post-transplant 
viral infections and disease relapse.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_488249] Blood Combined with Haploidentical CD34+ Cell Infusion Transplantation  
 
To harness the advantage of UCB availability and to overcome the disadvantage of delayed 
neutrophil recovery, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_389571] 27 adult patients with high risk leukemia received single unit UCB transplantation co-administered with an infusion of a 
relatively low number of highly purified haploident ical peripheral blood CD34+ cells from a related 
donor.[100] Rapid engraftment of a purified CD34+ haploidentical cells was observed with the 
median time to the ANC >500/L of 10 days (range 9-36). This engraftment was much more rapid 
than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_389572] a single UCB transplant (range 22-31 days). The time to a calculated cord blood ANC >500 cells/ul ranged from 13-55 days with a median of 22 days. With a median 
follow-up of 10 months (range 1-75 months), 19/27 patients survived. No major early infections, 
bacterial or fungal were observed and the need of antimicrobials during the period of neutropenia 
was lower than typi[INVESTIGATOR_389573]. Chimerism studies 
revealed initial engraftment of the haplo-CD34+ cells, followed by [CONTACT_389675]. With time, chimerism from the haplo-CD34+ donor was observed to 
disappear with full chimerism from the UCB unit ultimately being observed. This approach appears 
to provide the benefit of rapid neutrophil engraftm ent that occurs as a consequence of the CD34+ 
cell infusion with the cord blood unit engrafting thereafter restoring defective cellular immunity 
that typi[INVESTIGATOR_389574] a consequence of th e rigorous T-cell depletion associated with 
haploidentical stem cell infusion.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_488250] and/or enrich specific cell populations from allografts.   In this protocol we will use the Miltenyi CliniMacs immunomagenetic T cell depletion system that is 
widely used in Europe and available in the [LOCATION_003] only under an IND/IDE. The CliniMACS® CD34 
Reagent System is used in vitro to select CD34+ cells from heterogeneous hematological cell 
populations prior to transplantation.  The Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) Cell 
Processing Section has evaluated Miltenyi CliniMacs CD34-positive selection as a method for T 
cell depletion of filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC collections from normal donors.  Results 
(mean ± SD) are as follows (n=11 products): CD34 % recovery = 60 ± 13 % (range 41-77%) and CD3+ T cell depletion = 5.3 ± 0.2 log (range 5.1- 5.7 log) (personal communication with EJ Read).  
The T cell depletion is approximately one log greate r than the Isolex CD34 positive selection only 
process, which routinely achieves up to [ADDRESS_488251] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488252] disease (GVHD) has varied significantly among 
various studies of unrelated cord blood transplantation. Most have incorporated either tacrolimus 
or cyclosporine combined with other immunosuppres sive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, 
methotrexate, or a brief course of prednisone. At present, there is no accepted standard regimen for 
GVHD prophylaxis in this setting. This protocol will utilize tacrolimus in combination with 
mycophenolate mofetil and a brief course of prednisone as GVHD prophylaxis. 103 
 
3.0 SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL JUSTIFICATION 
 
Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a life-threatening bone marrow failure disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_389676] a hypocellular bone marrow.   Transplant and immunosuppressive treatment with 
ATG and CsA have dramatically changed the natural course of aplastic anemia, with 5 year 
survival of 75% in patients undergoing treatment[39]. However, of those patients treated with 
ATG/CsA, 25-33% will not respond; and about 50% of responders will relapse.[101] The 
introduction of more potent immunosuppressive medications such as alemtuzumab (Campath®) 
and r-ATG[16, 17] may have a favorable impact in response and relapse rates.  However, definite 
evidence that these novel immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389575], induce response and alleviate relapse as compared to the conventiona l h-ATG/CsA treatment regimen currently does not 
exist. Patients who fail immun osuppression who have an ANC’s <500 cells/ Pl are at high risk for 
death from opportunistic infections, particularly invasive fungal infections. Likewise, patients with 
refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia wi th ringed sideroblasts (RARS)subtypes of MDS 
who have severe neutropenia refractory to immunosuppression are also at high risk of death from opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections.   
 
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor 
offers the opportunity for cure in approximately 70 -80% of patients. [30, 31]  For patients lacking a 
matched related donor, a MUD transplant is the preferred therapy. However, many patients don’t 
have a matched unrelated donor identified or don’t have resources required for such a transplant.  
 
Transplantation using unrelated cord blood (UCB) has been shown to be a reasonable alternative 
transplant approach for patients with hematological disorders curable by [CONTACT_389677] a stem cell source.  The major disadvantage of UCB 
transplantation in adults is the limited number of  nucleated cells contained within the cord unit 
resulting in prolonged neutropenia and failure of  engraftment which contributes to infection and 
TRM. To harness the advantage of UCB availability and to overcome the disadvantage of delayed 
neutrophil recovery, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_389576][100] in 27 patients (median age 
29 years; range 16-60) with high risk leukemia who received a single unit UCB transplantation co-
administered with an infusion of a relatively low number of highly purified haploidentical 
peripheral blood CD34+ cells from a related donor following a fully myeloablative conditioning regimen that included TBI. Rapid engraftment of purified CD34+ haploidentical cells was observed 
with the median time to the ANC >500 cells/ul of 10 days (range 9-36). This engraftment was much 
more rapid than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_389572] a single UCB transplant (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 22-31 days).  
Chimerism studies showed initial predominant chimerism in mononuclear cells and granulocytes 
being derived from the haplo-CD34+ cells followed by [CONTACT_389678]. The time to a calculated cord blood ANC >500 cells/ul 
ranged from 13-[ADDRESS_488253] 
blood ANC being > 500 cells/ μl of 0.93 (95% CI 0.83-1.00). Ultimately, full cord blood chimerism 
occurred in 25/27 patients at a median 55 days (range 11-96). Seventy-four percent of patients 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488254] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 16 developed acute GVHD although only 4 (14.8%) patients developed more severe grade III-IV 
GVHD. With a median follow-up of 10 months (range 1-75 months), 19/27 patients survived. Eight 
of 27 patients died as a consequence of non-relap se mortality.  Causes of death included infection 
(n=3; 1 toxoplasmosis, 2 cytomegalovirus), vascular occlusive disease (VOD) (n=1), conditioning 
associated multisystem organ failure (MOF) (n=1), graft failure (n=1), and GVHD (n=2).   No 
major early infections, bacterial or fungal were observed.  The need of antimicrobials during the period of neutropenia was lower than typi[INVESTIGATOR_389577].[100] 
 
We therefore propose this research protocol of co-infusion of umbilical cord blood and 
haploidentical CD34+ cells following nonmyeloablative conditioning as treatment for subjects with SAA and RA and RARS subtypes of MDS refractory  to immunosuppressive therapy.  The study is 
being done to confirm the promising results published  by [CONTACT_389679]. Finally, it will investigate the engraftment potential of a novel 
nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen in this setting. Should engraftment rates be good (defined 
as an ANC > 500 in 80% of patients by [CONTACT_4475] 42), this protocol will serve as a platform for 
subsequent trials investigating the impact of infusing in vitro expanded NK cells from the cord blood unit to reduce GVHD and to facilitate engraftment.   
 
 Justification for health related quality of life measures 
 The Food and Drug Administration (Johnson & Templ e, 1985) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 
2008) endorse Health Related Quality of life (HRQ L) and its relevant dimensions as meaningful 
patient-reported indicators of the effects of treatment. The effects of allogeneic HSCT on HRQL 
dimensions are well established relative to stan dard conditioning regimens and disease populations. 
However, our understanding of the effects of reduced intensity conditioning regimens on specific 
disease populations such as aplastic anemia, bone marrow failure syndromes, PNH and 
myelodysplastic syndromes is less clear.  
 
 Therefore, we are proposing to incorporate a systematic evaluation of HRQL in adult individuals 
(English and Spanish when available) pre-transplant and throughout the trajectory of their recovery 
and follow-up post-transplant. Specifically, we request to incorporate patient-reported outcome 
measurements initially when the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] t is on-study (pre-transplant prior to inpatient 
admission for transplant), then following transplant at day 30, day 100, every at each 6-month 
interval until the [ADDRESS_488255] prepared from a 
haplo-identical donor using the Miltenyi CliniMacs system for CD34 selection, and a single t 4/6

neutropenia and who are not candidates for a tr ansplant utilizing an HLA matched sibling or 
unrelated donor.

 25 Oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day (or IV methylprednisolone if clinically indicated) will begin 
on day -[ADDRESS_488289] dose of h-ATG for serum sickness prophylaxis, and will be 
continued at this dose for 10 days; thereafter, prednisone will be slowly tapered over the next 
2 weeks until it is discontinued on day +19. Thos e recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389593] a longer tapering schedule and will be dosed individually as clinically indicated.   
 Infusions reactions will be treated symptomatically (e.g., anti-emetics, IV fluid hydration, 
acetaminophen, antihistamines, inhaled bronchodilators, meperidine).  
 
In case of moderate or severe reactions hydrocortisone will be given and the infusion will be 
discontinued and restarted at a slower rate once the symptoms have subsided. The patient is often treated in the ICU and may require pressors. The patient may require have one or two 
days of rest prior to restarting the ATG necessitating that the conditioning regime and 
radiation may be delayed by 1 – 3 days.  If this happens, the day of the transplant will be 
delayed by [CONTACT_389686] (by [CONTACT_8622] 3 days).  If a 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_135991] a persistent severe infusion reaction that does not respond to measures to 
ameliorate the signs/symptoms associated to the infusion, the infusion will be discontinued 
and further study participation will continue as planned with the exception that no further ATG will be administered. 
 
x Total body irradiation (TBI) : Day -1: All recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389594] a linear 
accelerator using energies higher than 4MV. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389595] a total

of Radiation Oncology.  Equally weighted oppose d lateral beams will be used to encompass 
the total body with the patient positioned supi [INVESTIGATOR_050]. TBI will be delivered with lateral fields 
using extended SAD values of 600cm.  Tissue compensators will be used if clinically 
appropriate.  Gonadal shielding will not be used. Occasionally, the total dose/technique of 
TBI may require modifications due to patient factors (unexpected or serious (grade 4-5) 
adverse events, serious medical illnesses not conducive to stable patient transfer, patient 
refusal, etc.) or treatment factors (linear acce lerator machine offline, etc.) Modifications to 
the radiation treatment will be at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and will be 
discussed with the PI.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_488290] blood unit:  
 
Minimum total nucleated cells (TNC) (prior to thawing) of 1.5 x 107 per kilogram of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389596]: if the minimum criterion of TNC is 
not met the cord unit must contain at least 1.7 x 105 CD34+ cells/kg (prior to thawing).  
For cord blood products, there is no upper limit (maximum TNC) for the UCB unit since 
cord units are inherently limited in their number of TNCs and studies to date have not 
identified any adverse related outcomes asso ciated with using higher cord blood cell 
doses. 
 Confirmatory typi[INVESTIGATOR_16149] a minimum antigen level match in 4/[ADDRESS_488291] blood unit will not be requested until the DTM confirms that the G-CSF 
mobilized T-cell depleted graft collected from the haploidentical donor contains a 
suitable number of CD34+ cells ( ≥2 x 10

tacrolimus therapeutic drug levels of 11-15 ng/mL.  When the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389598], the 24-hour dose of tacrolimus will be converted to oral dosing (generally using a 
1:3 or 1:[ADDRESS_488293]) and 
administered in two divided doses every [ADDRESS_488294] 6 
months.  NOTE: there may be some circumstances when it is medically indicated to stop 
tacrolimus before the time frame indicated here.  
 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF):  1 gram (or approximately 15mg/kg/dose) administered orally or 
intravenously twice daily starting day 0 and continued for 100 days (possibly longer depending 
on PI’s discretion ).  NOTE: there may be some circumstances when it is medically indicated to 
stop MMF before the time frame indicated here.  
 
Prednisone:  Oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day will begin on day -[ADDRESS_488295] dose of h-ATG 
for serum sickness prophylaxis, and will be continued at this dose for 10 days; thereafter, 
prednisone will be slowly tapered over the next 2 weeks until it is discontinued on day +19. 
Prednisone may be converted to an equivalent  dose of methylprednisolone for intravenous 
administration if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389599].

7.12 Health Related Quality of Life Measures (adults only): 
 
PROMIS 29-Profile v1.0 and PROMIS v1.0-Applied Cognition-General Concerns-Short Form  
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informat ion System (PROMIS ®), is an initiative 
based on an NIH grant to establish and provide the public a free, reliable and validated source for 
commonly used measures of patient-reported outcomes (PROMIS, 2011). The PROMIS item 
databanks have been tested for reliability and comparability to more established measures of 
these same content areas by [CONTACT_389687]-
Response Theory (Baker, 2004).  
 
The PROMIS 29 item profile instrument is a collection of profile short forms assessing seven 
primary HRQL domains (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep 
disturbance, and satisfaction with participation in social roles).  The PROMIS Applied Cognition-
General Concern measure assesses problems with memory and concentration (Riley et al., 2010). 
 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-BMT (FACT-BMT) 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy –BMT version 4 (FACT-BMT)  measures disease 
specific QOL in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The FACT-BMT is an extended version of The Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy –General (FACT-G) with 12 additional items that are transplant 
specific (Cella, 2004). The FACT-BMT has demonstr ated validity and has evidence of internal 
consistency and reliability in the BMT population and in Spanish speaking oncology patients 
(Cella, 2004; Cella et al., 1998).  
 
Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ) [subscales: Medical Impact and Problems, gender 
specific version] 
The Sexual Functioning Questionnaire is a 30-item measure, self-report questionnaire (Syrjala, 
2000). For this study we will use screening questions 1-3, the 9-item Problems, 2-item 
Satisfaction, and the 5-item Medical Impact subsca les. Respondents will be given an option to 
“opt-out” of the questions. Internal consistency and reliabilities have been reported above .[ADDRESS_488297]-BMT. It has demonstrated an internal consistency 
(Cronbach ’s D 0.79-0.85), test-re-test reliability on all subscales (0.74-0.83) (Lee et al., 2002).

 8.2  Pre-Consent Evaluation and Concurrent Care of Minor Donors (donors less than age 18   only)  
 
 For donors less than age 18, a social worker and mental health specialist (psychologist or 
psychiatrist) will meet with the minor prior to the assent process to confirm willingness to 
participate. 
 
 For donors less than age 18, a pediatric provider (pediatrician, pediatric nurse practitioner or 
pediatric physician’s assistant) will be provided who is separate from the transplant team and is 
charged to consider the health and welfare of the minor donor. This practitioner will serve as the 
donor’s health care provider and advocate during the minor’s participation on the clinical trial.

8.3 Apheresis of Haplo Donor for Lymphocytes (optional, ages 18 and older only) 
Collection of lymphocytes for haplo donor T cells (or lymphocytes) will be collected from the 
allograft, after CD [ADDRESS_488301]-transplant studies.  
 
8.4 Donor Mobilization with G-CSF 
 
After medical evaluation and clearance for suitability as an allogeneic donor by [CONTACT_389689], the donor will undergo stem cell mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF, 
Neupogen®, [COMPANY_010]®) as an outpatient. Filgrastim (G-CSF) will be administered based on body weight (see below) for 5-[ADDRESS_488302] be given very early in the 
morning, prior to apheresis.  Predictable side ef fects of filgrastim (G-CSF), including headache, 
bone pain, and myalgia, will be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Prophylactic treatment 
of these side effects with the same medications may be elected.  Other side effects will be 
evaluated and treated accordingly. 
 
8.4.1 Minor donor mobilization with G-CSF ( ≤ 18 years old) 
 
Filgrastim (G-CSF) will be administered according to a vial based algorithm to reduce wastage, 
improve donor compliance, and optimize CD34 yields.  
 Donor Wt           Total filgrastim (G-CSF) Dose (range) 
15-18.9 kg    10 mcg/kg/dose 19-30.9 kg  300 mcg (10.0 to 15.8 mcg/kg)

8.4.2 Adult donor mobilization with G-CSF (> 18 years old) – per Supportive Care Guidelines  
 Dose algorithms  
 
Two dosing algorithms are recommended for use in the Clinical Center. The standard dose and 
higher dose algorithm.  The higher dose algorithm is intended for use in donors whose 
components will undergo further processing.  As this study involves grafts that will undergo cell 
processing, the higher dose algorithm will be used for all donors enrolled on this protocol.  The 
total dose is capped at 1200 mcg/kg/day.

 > 109 kg   1200 mcg   (11.0 or less)  
 
8.5 Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Collection & Processing    
 
PBSC apheresis will be done on day 5, and if necessary on day 6 and day 7 of filgrastim (G-
CSF), i.e., after the 5th, and possibly the 6th, and if necessary the 7th day doses of filgrastim (G-
CSF) (which are given in the early morning).  All apheresis procedures will be done using a 2-
armed approach or by [CONTACT_389690], using the Baxter 
CS3000Plus or the Cobe Spectra.   The volume processed per apheresis procedure will be 
determined by [CONTACT_389691], based on peak CD34 cell mobilization 
response to G-CSF and the CD34 cell dose needed, based on kilogram weight of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  This 
will range from [ADDRESS_488304] day apheresis collection will not 
be required if the CD34 dose is 3 x106/kg or more after the first day of collection.  
 
Anticoagulation will be accomplished with acid citr ate dextrose (ACD-A).  If the donor is small 
or intolerant to ACD-A and the adverse citrate effects cannot be controlled by [CONTACT_389692] 
(slowing flow rate, oral or IV calcium), consideration will be given to using heparin 
anticoagulation.  Donors will receive divalent ca tion prophylaxis to prevent citrate toxicity during 
apheresis, in accordance with standard DTM policies.    
 
If the minimum CD34+ cell dose is not achieved, a third apheresis may be performed (after an 
additional [7th] dose of filgrastim [G-CSF]), if it is predicted that the minimum CD34 cell target 
can be achieved in this way.     
 
If the minimum CD34+ cell dose from the haploidentical donor has not been achieved after one 
cycle of mobilization, a 2nd mobilization with up to two full apheresis collections to achieve the 
minimum CD34+ cell dose may be performed after an interval of at least 10 days or an alternative 
related haploidentical donor may be selected to undergo mobilization.  
 
Stem cell products will be cryopreserved after each collection and stored until transfusion into the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (see NIH Clinical Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Processing 
Section’s SOPs).  From experience with over [ADDRESS_488305] cases both the CD34+ cell target and the CD3+ T cell target will be achieved.   
 
8.6 Ex Vivo Processing of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) and Lymphocytes 
 
In general, the PBSC processing goals are to maximize CD34+ cell content and deplete CD3+ 
lymphocytes using the CD34-selection system from Miltenyi (see section 15).  From experience 
with over [ADDRESS_488306] cases both the CD34+ 
cell target and the CD3+ T cell target will be achieved.  In the majority of donors, peripheral blood stem cell processing with the Miltenyi system will result in doses of CD3+ cells well below 
1 x 10
4/kg. 
 
The erythrocyte content of the apheresis product is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_488307] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488308] is given to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389607]'s transplantation schedule. If the final result (no growth at 14 days) is not 
available before the final product is given to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the principal investigator (PI) is 
notified. If a culture is positive at any time during the incubation period, the microbiology testing laboratory performs a gram stain on the liquid media and notifies the cell therapy lab of the 
preliminary morphologic finding. The cell th erapy lab will immediately notify the PI.  
Concurrently, the testing lab will plate the liquid media onto solid media for organism 
identification and sensitivity testing. These results are usually available within 48-72 hours. The 
results are immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_389608].  
 
Products released for infusion into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389609] 21 CFR subpart C (1271.45-1271.90) which sets out the requirements for determining donor eligibility.  
 
Viability testing is performed with 7-AAD via flow cytometry.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_488309] CD34 enrichment, PBSC products are usually cryopreserved in vials; rarely in 25ml bags. 
The container used at cryopreservation depends on the cell content of the product. Below is a 
table modified from DTM cryopreservation and thaw SOPs (DTM-SOP-5101 and 5102, 
respectively) which details the volumes and range of cell concentrations at cryopreservation and 
at infusion. Products cryopreserved in vials ar e transferred to another container for infusion. 
Transfers are performed in a biologic safety cabinet. Since the final product for infusion is transferred from the vial used to cryopreserve th e product to another container, another sterility 
sample will be obtained. The sample for testing is obtained from rinsing the original 
cryopreservation container with the same diluent as  used to dilute the final product.  50 ml bags 
will not be used for this protocol, but are included here for completeness.

8.[ADDRESS_488311] BLOOD PROCESSING 
 
Pre-cryopreservation:  Only licensed cord blood units will be used or if a licensed cord blood unit 
is not available, umbilical cord blood (UCB) units will be obtained through the NMDP multicenter 
access and distribution protocol for unlicensed cyropreserved cord blood units.  Cord blood units 
will be collected and cryopreserved according to the Cord Blood Bank Participation Criteria, 
including Policies and Procedures stated therein, and the NMDP requirements for product release. Donor eligibility determination is performed according to NMDP standards and/or FACT-Netcord 
guidelines in the case of cord blood units. The NMDP standards are set by a board of NMDP 
network representatives including cord blood banks, transplant centers, donor and recruitment 
centers, and follow the most recent FDA eligibility guidelines.    
 The table below details the infectious disease mark er testing and acceptance  criteria (suitability 
criteria for cord blood units): 
Test NMDP action 
HBsAg Accept non-reactive 
Anti-HBc Accept non-reactive 
Anti-HCV Accept non-reactive 
Anti-HIV1/2 Accept non-reactive 
HIV p24Ag Performed if HIV-1 NAT testing is not performed 
Accept non-reactive 
HIV-1 and HCV Accept non-reactive 
Anti-HTLV I/II Accept non-reactive 
Anti-CMV IgG or total Accept non-reactive 
Accept reactive 
Serologic syphilis Accept non-reactive 
 
Ordering procedures : Jennifer Wilder, the NIH Certified Hematopoietic Umbilical Cord 
Transplant Coordinator will conduct the search and arrange for procurement of unrelated umbilical 
cord product for this protocol. Once a suitable cord blood product is identified, shipment of the 
cord blood unit will not be requested until the DTM confirms that the G-CSF mobilized T-cell 
depleted graft collected from the haploidentical donor contains a suitable number of CD34+ cells (≥2 x 10
6/kg) and CD3+ T-cells (< 1 x 104 CD3+ cells/ kg) (i.e. technical failure of the depletion 
process has not occurred). Once CD34+ cell content is confirmed, the cord blood unit will  be 
shipped to the Department of Transfusion Medi cine Cell Processing Section (CPS) per NMDP 
procedures, in dry shippers.  
 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488312] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488313] blood units: Upon arrival, the UCB units will be transferred to LN2 storage in 
CPS until date of infusion. Prior to infusion, the PI, in consultation with CPS, will evaluate the 
RBC content, if ABO incompatible, to determin e whether washing the UCB to remove excess 
RBC is warranted. Whether the UCB units are thawed and released for infusion with or without 
washing, UCB units will be stored, processed and released for infusion per DTM CPS procedures 
(see NIH DTM SOP 5107 [product receipt] and NIH DTM SOP 5102 [thaw and infusion]).  
Post-cryopreservation : Each product is thawed and prepared for immediate infusion. Sterility and 
viability testing is done post thaw as is a progen itor cell assay (CFU) and a complete cell count.  
The cord units will be infused with a goal viability of >= 70%. Cord units with lower than this 
viability will still be infused and we will track the outcome of these poorer viability units and report them in our annual report. Viability is performed with 7-AAD via flow cytometry. The 
sample is obtained post thaw, post dilution. 
 
Laboratory staff coordinates closely with the nursin g staff administering the product such that the 
product is thawed and delivered to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s bedside for immediate infusion.  Product is not 
stored post thaw.  
  
10.0 MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS  
 
The major complications are acute and chronic GVHD, reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
and graft failure. Subjects with these complications will be treated as follows: 
 
10.1 Acute GVHD ( See PBSCT Supportive Care Guidelines ) 
 10.2 Chronic GVHD ( See also PBSCT Supportive Care Guidelines ) 
 
x Tacrolimus and/or cyclosporine at standard dose. 
x Prednisone dosed according to severity. 
x Change to alternate day steroid and Tacrolimus/cyclosporine therapy when response is 
established. 
x Non-responding subjects may be treated with other standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389610], mycophenolate, azathioprine, photopheresis, daclizumab, infliximab, rituximab, or thalidomide at the discretion of the attending physician.   
 
10.3 CMV Reactivation (see section 7.3 Infection Prophylaxis and Treatment) 
 
10.4 EBV reactivation (see section 7.3 Infection Prophylaxis and Treatment) 
 10.5 Graft Failure/Relapse of Marrow Aplasia 
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389611] a neutrophil count of ≥500 cel ls/μl by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_488314] primary graft failur e. Subjects with primary graft failure  will be treated with 
supportive care (transfusions, growth factors, etc)  when clinically indicated.  If the subject is 
found to have one or more additional HLA compatible (i.e. > 4/6) cord blood units, and remains 
neutropenic, they will be offered co- enrollment onto the Branch’s standard of care protocol where 
they may be treated with a subsequent single or double cord unit transplant using a conventional 
transplant approach. Subjects who are not a candidate for a salvage cord blood transplant will be 
treated with supportive care and may be referred back to their referring physician if it is in the 
best interest of the subject. Data collection to include outcome and survival will continue, 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488315] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488316].  
Secondary graft failure is defined as the develo pment of sustained cytopenia and/ or continued 
requirement for platelet or red blood cell transfusions after initial successful primary engraftment.  In this setting, a boost of hematopoietic stem cells from the original stem cell donor may be 
subsequently administered to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. This process will involve the infusion of CD34
+ cells 
that are collected from the original haploidentic al stem cell donor following conventional GCSF 
mobilization that are CD34 selected using the Miltenyi CliniMACS system. In the event the 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389612] (i.e., due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389613]) these cells may be shipped by [CONTACT_389695] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a transfusion service for infusion consistent with their Human 
Subjects Protection Policies. 
 
10.6 Pulmonary Engraftment Syndrome   
 
Subjects who develop pulmonary engraftment syndrome (most likely 10-[ADDRESS_488317] transplant) will be treated with steroids. 
 
 
11.0 ANCILLARY LABORATORY RESEARCH STUDIES    
During the course of study participation, specimens will be collected for correlative studies. 
 
11.1 Collection, Storage and Disposition of Sample s 
Intended use: These specimens will not be read by a pathologist or used for diagnostic purposes.   
These studies will not be used in assessing the primary endpoint but are undertaken for 
descriptive or exploratory ancillary research, and have been approved by [CONTACT_389696]. 
Hemorrhagic cystitis study:  We will share the following de -identified research samples with [CONTACT_389723]’s laboratory at NCI: blood, urine,  serum, plasma, CSF, Lung lavage fluid.  His 
lab will perform deep sequencing on DNA extracted from BKV viral particles using the Illumina Nextera/MiSeq platform.  BKV neutralization serology will also be performed. 
Hepatitis E research study: We will share de -identified plasma samples with Dr A. Gretchen 
Buckler’s laboratory at DTM/Clinical Center.  Her lab will  test them for hepatitis E RNA and, if 
they find positives, will work towards setting up a prospective trial to determine if future patients 
show evidence of contracting hepatitis E through transfusion using linked donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91582].  
Etiology of post-transplant syndromes:  We will share de-identified blood plasma and/or serum 
with [CONTACT_389724] at NIDDK.  [CONTACT_389724] will use blood plasma and or serum to conduct 
studies on the etiology of post -transplant syndromes that cause renal failure including nephrotic 
syndrome, TMA, and glomerulonephritis. 
Tracking:   Samples will be ordered and tracked through the CRIS research screens.  Should a 
CRIS screen not be available, the NIH form 2803-[ADDRESS_488318] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 35 notification and an executed MTA.  In accordance with the NHLBI Biospecimen Inventory 
system (BSI) policy, the specimens are inventoried in BSI.    
Storage:   Research samples will be stored with identifiers in the secure laboratory of the 
principal investigator.  
End of study procedures :  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no 
longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time 
they will be destroyed.  
Loss or destruction of samples :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan for 
tracking and storage of samples has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
11.2 Research Sample Collection  
 
11.2.1   Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389614]:   60 ml peripheral blood  will be collected at days 15, 
30, 42, 60, 100 (+/- 7 days for all) and then at scheduled annual follow-up visits for 
chimerism analysis lymphocyte subset analysis.   
 
Subjects will be offered co-enrollment on protocol 07-I-0183: The collection of research 
samples and data for repository from unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389615].  If consented to participate on this 
ancillary study, one ACD (acid citrate dextrose) anti-coagulated blood-20 ml drawn in a yellow top tube - will be sent to the NMDP research sample repository.  A MTA for these 
samples has been executed.  In pediatric recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the amount drawn will be 1-20 ml, 
not to exceed 3ml/kg (the NMDP has no mini mum blood sample size from a pediatric 
subject). 
 
11.2.2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389616]: One apheresis collection of approximately 10
10 leukocytes in a 
volume of 200 ml, pre-transplant.  
 
11.2.3 Donor blood sample: Cells obtained during the apheresis procedures (stem cells and 
lymphocytes) additional to those required for the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389617].    
 
11.2.4  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389618]: An extra volume (up to 25 ml) of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_389619]. The cells will be used to investigate lymphocyte interactions with 
bone marrow progenitor cell proliferation. No marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_389620]. 
 
11.2.5      Pulmonary function tests 
 Pulmonary status at baseline, day 30 and after day 100 will be analyzed to see if reduced 
intensity conditioning (RIC) effects lung function before day 100 or if the decline in lung 
function is only seen later, consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).   Pulmonary status will be  assessed in all subjects except for those under the age of [ADDRESS_488319]’s inability to perform the 
pulmonary function test. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_488320] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 36 12.1   Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint is donor engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42 +/- 3 days (defined as an ANC of >500) 
from either the haplo donor, the cord, or both combined.  
 
12.2      Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will include: 
x ANC recovery rate (ANC ≥ 500 cells/Pl) at day 22, 100 day (+/- 3 days) and 6 months 
(+/- 2 weeks)  
x treatment related mortality (TRM) 
x standard transplant outcome variables such as non-hematologic toxicity, incidence and 
severity of acute and chronic GVHD, and relapse of disease.  
 
Health related quality of life will also be assessed as secondary outcome measures.  The 
following parameters will be recorded: 
 
x CD34 + cell dose, CD3 + cell dose 
x Degrees of cord blood, related haplo-CD34+ cell donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389621] T-
lymphocyte, NK cell, and myeloid lineages assessed by [CONTACT_389697] (STRs) 
x Neutrophil recovery (days to neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10
9/l) 
x Days to an UCB neutrophil count of 0.5 x 109/l  
x Platelet recovery (days to platelet count of 20 x 109, days to transfusion independence) 
x Red cell recovery (days to transfusion independence)  
x Incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD (the DSMB will monitor for evidence 
of excessive GVHD)  
x Graft failure (loss of the graft as measured by [CONTACT_389698]) 
x Cumulative incidence of late graft failure 
x Time to transfusion independence 
x Non-hematological effects attributable to the preparative regimen 
x Disease progression or relapse 
x Transplant related mortality before and after day [ADDRESS_488321] 80% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389622] 60%. Let p denote the probability of engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42. We will 
test the null hypothesis that p is less than or equa l to 0.[ADDRESS_488322] 0.8. We choose a two-stage minimax design 
[102] which allows early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389623] = 0.05 and power = 
0.80. 
 
In the first stage we will enter (up to) [ADDRESS_488323] 
engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42, we consider the procedure unsuccessful (rejecting the alternative 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488324] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 37 hypothesis), but if at least [ADDRESS_488325] those subjects that are non- evaluable for the study’s primary 
endpoint.  
 
12.4     Methods of Statistical Analysis  
 
Although the primary endpoint for this protocol is  persistent engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42, subjects will 
be followed up for 60 months on protocol and then contact[CONTACT_389699], long-term disease-free and overall survival. 
 
At the completion of follow-up for all subjects, time-to-event distributions (disease-free survival, 
non-relapse mortality and overall survival) will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method or 
competing risk methods, as appropriate, and 95% confidence intervals for the median time to 
events will be calculated. 
 12.[ADDRESS_488326] 50% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389624].  A modified Haybittle-Peto procedure with Bonferroni adjustment will be used:  we would require a conservative p-value <0.[ADDRESS_488327] the null 
hypothesis of primary endpoint at the interim analysis.   We would not stop the trial based on 
early evidence of clinical benefit at the interim subgroup analysis, and we would continue 
enrollment to the original planned sample size.  At the final analysis we would require p<0.049 to 
declare significant improvement in the primary endpoint.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389625]:  If there are 5 treatment related deaths (TRM) prior to day 42, we 
will stop the trial early.  Early deaths determined to be related to treatment will be included in the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58106]. If we are convinced that a death before day 42 is unrelated to treatment, 
we will ask the IRB to review the data and permit continuation if deemed appropriate.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_126669]:  In the first stage, if [ADDRESS_488328] engraftment by [CONTACT_4475] 42, we 
will stop the trial early (even before all 13 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389626]). If at least [ADDRESS_488329] and second stages, we stop the trial early (even before additional 22 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389627]). 
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58106] :   We wish to assure that this procedure has less than 50% day [ADDRESS_488330] 90%. We 
take our prior distribution to be a beta distribution so that our prior clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_389628] 20% 
of the weight we will place on the new data. This gives prior parameters alpha = 4.05, beta = 4.95.We will begin monitoring [ADDRESS_488331] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO)

We conducted a simulation to evaluate this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. We generated a study with 35 independent 
Bernoulli trials, with probability p for 200 day TRM and determined whether the study was stopped. We repeated the simulations 100,000 times. When the probability of 200 day TRM was 0.4, the probability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389629] 0.10.  When the probability of 200 day TRM was 0.5, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389630] 0.40.  When the probability of 200 day TRM was 0.6, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389631] 0.78. When the probability of 200 day TRM was 0.7, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389629] 0.98.

13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
 13.1 Safety Monitoring 
 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_389641]. The protocol will be 
continuously evaluated for any unusual or unpredicted complications with the aim of detecting 
and preventing unacceptable increase in morbidity and mortality over and above that anticipated from unmanipulated bone marrow transplants (see stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186179] 12.5). 
 
 NIH Intramural  IRB . Accrual and safety data will be monitored reviewed annually by [CONTACT_5030] (IRB). Prior to implementation of this study, the protocol and the 
proposed subject consent and assent forms will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_108670] (IRB) operating according to the [ADDRESS_488336] continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to accrual or 
follow up of subjects.  
 
DSMB : The NHLBI Data Safety and Monitoring Board will review the protocol at six or twelve 
month intervals.  A progress report will be forwarded to the DSMB at these times. The DSMB 
may recommend early termination of the study for considerations of safety and efficacy.  
 
Monitoring:  As per ICH-GCP 5.18 and FDA 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to 
be adequately monitored by [CONTACT_4530].   The monitoring of this study will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_389700] (CRAs)/Monitors employed by [CONTACT_389701]. The objectives of a 
monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed consent form (ICF) and 
documentation of the ICF process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt and 
accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare 
abstracted information with individual s ubjects’ records and source  documents (subject’s char ts, 
laboratory analyses and test results, physician s’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other 
relevant original subject information); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in compliance with 
the protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488337] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 40 regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research Protections-OHRP and FDA) and 
applicable guidelines (ICH-GCP) are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the 
investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study 
progress and monitoring visit. 
 
The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms and pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43561], FDA, the site

13.2 Definitions 
 
Adverse Event (AE):   Any untoward medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign 
(e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in 
the research. 
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE  if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by 
[CONTACT_39132]: 
 
x Results in discontinuation from the study 
x Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
x Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
x Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
x Is judged by [CONTACT_52374] 
x If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clin ically significant, the investigator will provide 
details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  A serious adverse event that: 
x results in death; 
x is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); 
x results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488339] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 41 x results in a persistent or significant incapacity; 
x results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
x based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
 
Suspected adverse reaction: Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to  suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Serious event: An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or if it 
requires immediate corrective action by a PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or IRB to protect the safety, welfare or rights of subjects. 
 
Unexpected adverse reaction : An adverse event or suspected adverse rea ction is considered “unexpected” 
if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not requir ed or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or su spected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically ment ioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation. 
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP) :  Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria: 
1. unexpected  in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and  
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
2. related or possibly related  to participation in the research; and 
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm  (including physical, psychological, economic, or 
social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
 
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event :  An unanticipated problem that does not fit the 
definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], involves risk to the 
subject, affect others in the research study, or sign ificantly impact the integrity of research data.  For 
example, report occurrences of breaches of confidenti ality, accidental destruction of study records, or 
unaccounted-for study drug. 
 
Protocol Deviation (PD):   Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved research 
protocol.  
Non-compliance:  The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, or 
regulatory requirements for the protection of human research. Noncompliance may be further 
characterized as: 
 1. Serious non-compliance: Non-compliance that: 
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants. 
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants. 
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP. 
d. Invalidates the study data. 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488340] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 42  
2. Continuing non-compliance: Non-compliance that is recurring. An example may be a pattern of 
non-compliance that suggests a likelihood that, absent an intervention, non-compliance will 
continue. Continuing noncompliance could also in clude a failure to respond to IRB requests to 
resolve previous allegations of non-compliance. 
 3. Minor (non-serious) non-compliance: Non-compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing. 
 
13.2.1 Event Characterization and Reporting to the IRB and Clinical Director (CD)  
Approved by [CONTACT_106636] 30, 2013 
Date effective: October 28, [ADDRESS_488341] learns of the event.  SAEs that do not meet the criteria of Unanticipated Problem (UP) must be reported to the Clinical 
Director within [ADDRESS_488342] learns of the event. 
  13.3 Adverse Events –Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
 
13.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting and Collection 
 
Adverse events used to evaluate the safety of this protocol regimen will be collected to include 
any unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms and/or 
diseases (i.e. incidence of GVHD, graft failure, regimen related toxicities, or infectious 
complications) which either occur during the study, having been absent at baseline or if present at 
baseline, appear to worsen with the exceptions listed below.  The AE reporting period for this 
study begins when the patient starts the prepar ative regimen, except for AEs at least possibly 
related to a study procedure performed prior to the start of the preparative regimen (i.e., 
apheresis).  AEs will be collected until completion of the [ADDRESS_488343] possibly related to the transplant will be recorded and reported to the IRB.  
The AEs will be attributed (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely) to study 
medication and graded by [CONTACT_389702] (CTCAE) version 3.0.  A copy of the criteria can be down-loaded from the CTEP home page at   
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
.   
 
Events not included in the CTCAE will be graded as follows: 
 Grade 1: Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment 
required beyond prophylaxis 
 Grade 2: Moderate: discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, require 
treatment 
 Grade 3: Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding to first 
line treatment 
 Grade 4: Life-threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death

identified, anonymous data will be released to the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) according to federally mandated policies and procedures.  
 
End of study procedures :  Data will be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected 
database until it is no longer of scientific value.  
 
Loss or destruction of data :  Should we become aware that a major breech in the plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
 
Publication policy : Given the research mandate of the NIH, subject data including the results of 
testing and responses to treatment will be entered into an NIH-authorized and controlled research 
database. Any future research use will occur only after appropriate human subject protection 
institutional approval such as prospective NIH IRB review and approval or an exemption from 
the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research (OHSR) .

Aplastic anemia (AA) :   The study will be open to all AA subjects who satisfy the inclusion 
criteria and provide an informed consent to the protocol. No subjects will be excluded from 
participation based on gender, race or ethnicity.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_389645], and that 90% of the subjects will be 
Caucasian.   
 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS):  The  NHLBI has a robust source of subjects with bone 
marrow failure and we do not anticipate recruitment to be problematic. Since 1997, we have 
screened over 400 subjects with MDS (about 30/year).  
  
Recruitment efforts :  The study will be listed on ClinicalTrials.gov, the Clinical Center research 
studies website, The Aplastic Anemia Foundation, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute subject recruitment website.  If recruitment goals are not met, a recruitment plan will be 
developed by [CONTACT_106641].  
 Competition between Branch protocols:   There are no competing branch protocols for this 
subject population.    
 
Reimbursement for protocol participation, travel, food, and lodging  will be consistent with 
NIH guidelines.  In determining reimbursement, th e following factors are considered applicable 
to this protocol:   the patients are diagnosed with a rare disease; the patient population is sick; the 
protocol offers the potential for direct benefit; the protocol regimen is demanding; and in order to 
complete accrual in a reasonable timeframe a geographically dispersed participant population is 
required.

14.2 Participation of Children  
   
14.2.1  As recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:  
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488355] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488356] bl ood transplantation. The use of haploidentical 
stem cells may also serve as a backup stem cell source should the graft be rejected, which 
potentially could prevent rejection related mortality.    
 
14.2.2  As donors: 
 
Allogeneic bone marrow (and peripheral blood) transplantation (BMT) provides an option for 
cure for aplastic anemia and is therefore is cons idered an accepted standard clinical intervention 
for this disease.   The donor would be donating stem cells to his/her family member regardless of 
the objectives of this research protocol.     We are however excluding from participation as donors, 
children who weigh <18 kg and are < 6 years of age. The risks of the apheresis procedure are 
related to the weight of the child, more precisely his/her extracorporeal volume, which is weight-
dependent.  The risks have to do with (1) need for a central line, (2) need for an allogeneic red 
cell prime, (3) need for systemic heparinization because subject is too small to get citrate: 
 
> 25 kg :  the procedure and associated risk is the same as that in an adult, however a central 
line is almost always needed.    
 
19 to 25 kg :  A central line is required.  Donors may or may not need a central line (at the 
discretion of the apheresis department). With  concurrent magnesium and calcium infusion, 
children may be safely anti-coagulated with citrate. 
 
On sister protocol 99-H-0050, 5 of 10 (50%) of minor donors (4/15/2009) required femoral 
lines, three of which (ages 6, 7, and 10) required conscious sedation. 
 
14.2.3  As participants in research studies:   
 
Pediatric donors may participate only in those laboratory studies that the IRB finds involves no 
greater than minimal risk to children provided th at adequate provisions are made for soliciting the 
assent of the children and the permission of their parents or guardians.  
 
14.3  Hazards and Discomforts 
  
14.3.1  The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389646]:  Intravenous line placement carries a small risk of bleeding, 
bruising or pain and a very low risk of accidental injury to the adjacent artery and nerve. Some 
participants may experience a vasovagal reaction (lightheadedness, or, rarely fainting due to temporary lowering of blood pressure).  
 
Related to bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]:  No major risks are involved with bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26673].  However, a small risk of infections, pain, bleeding, and hematoma formation at the site 
of the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218047].  
 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488357] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 [ADDRESS_488358] x-ray:  The risks associated with x-rays are very small.  For example, one chest 
x-ray has the same increased risk of death (due to cancer) as smoking 1.[ADDRESS_488359]:  Risks are minimal, but some subjects may become 
lightheaded or faint during the test.  The test coul d also trigger an asthma attack in persons with 
asthma.
 
 
Related to CT scans:  Oral and/or intravenous contrast agents will be used and are usually well 
tolerated.  However, some subjects will experience allergic reactions to intravenous contrast. To 
lower the risk of allergic reactions, low allergenic contrast agents are administered at NIH 
Clinical Center.  In addition, subjects will be advised that approximately 2-7% of patients who 
receive contrast agents will experience a temporary reduction in kidney function lasting up to [ADDRESS_488360] is comparable to 8 months of 
natural background radiation.
 
 Related to EKG (age > 50 or > 40 with risk factor):  There is no pain or risk associated with 
having an electrocardiogram.  
 
Related to echocardiogram (age > 50 or > 40 with risk factor):  This test has no known side 
effects. 
 
Related to MUGA scan (age > 50 or > 40 with risk factor):  There are no known adverse events 
associated with a MUGA scan.  The radiotracer used during the scan has a radiation dose similar 
to that of a CT scan (8 months of natural background radiation).  
 
Related to cardiac stress test (age > 50 or > 40 with risk factor):  The possible risks of this 
procedure are: an allergic reaction to the radioactive dye or a flushed feeling; lightheadedness or 
fainting from the exertion; an abnormal heart rhythm brought on by [CONTACT_389704].  Although very 
rare, it is possible that a nuclear stress test could cause a heart attack. 
 
Related to the quality of life instruments:  Subjects may feel uncomfortable answering the 
questions.   
 
Related to the transplant procedure:    Stem cell transplantation is a major procedure, which 
entails serious discomforts and hazards for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  The major limitation of UCB 
transplantation in adults is the limited number of  nucleated cells contained within the cord unit 
resulting in prolonged neutropenia and failure of engraftment, which contributes to infection and 
TRM.  Full haplotype mismatched transplants have been associated with a risk of transplant-related mortality as high as 50%. The high frequency of alloreactive donor T cells in 
unmanipulated grafts that recognize mismatched  MHC antigens results in an extremely high 
incidence of severe, acute GVHD. Although extensive T cell depletion prevents GVHD, the 
rejection rates rise steeply because the balance between competing host and donor T cells shifts in 
favor of the unopposed host-versus-graft reaction. Furthermore, T-cell depletion is associated 
with a greater risk of post-transplant viral infections, secondary

 49 Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and disease relapse. Toxicities potentially associated with the 
infusion of the CBU include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) toxicity and side effects from intact and 
hemolyzed red cells and may include changes in heart rate or rhythm, changes in blood pressure, 
fever, chills, sweats, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fluid overload, headache, 
dyspnea, hemoglobinuria, allergic reaction, acute renal failure, and in rare cases infusion reaction 
resulting in death.  
The mortality from a cord blood or f ull haplotype mismatched transplants  may be as high as 40%. 
It is therefore only appropriate to carry out the procedure with its experimental component in the 
context of a life-threatening condition and with full informed consent from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389647]. The major hazards (graft failure/rejection, GVHD, infection, and disease relapse) have already been mentioned. Inevitably after transplantation, blood counts will 
decrease with an associated requirement for red blood cell and platelet transfusions, as well as a 
need for empi[INVESTIGATOR_389648].  At the time of count 
recovery, there is also a small risk of pulmonary engraftment syndrome, manifested by [CONTACT_105]-
infectious fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and dyspne a, which can be treated effectively with prompt 
administration of corticosteroids.  The major di scomforts during the post-transplant period are 
those of nausea, mucositis, anorexia, diarrhea, fe ver, malaise, and intolerance of the isolation 
period.  Possible organ toxicities related to the high-dose preparative regimen include hepatic 
veno-occlusive disease  and interstitial pneumonitis, which can be fatal. 
 
Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389649], disease, and treatment-related 
factors. In the largest study to date to evaluate risk factors for solid cancers, a multi-institutional 
cohort of [ZIP_CODE] allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389650] 189 solid malignancies. Overall, patients 
developed new solid cancers at twice the rate expected based on general population rates (observed-
to-expected ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.8-2.5) , with the risk increasing over time (P trend < 
0.001); the risk reached 3-fold among patients followed for 15 years or more after transplantation. 
These findings showed that the risk of develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a non-squamous cell carcinoma (non-SCC) 
following conditioning radiation was highly dependent on age at exposure. Among patients irradiated 
at ages under 30 years, the relative risk of non-SCC was 9 times that of non-irradiated patients, while 
the comparable risk for older patients was 1.1 (P interaction <.01). Chronic graft-versus-host disease 
and male sex were the main determinants for risk of SCC. These data indicate that allogeneic 
transplant survivors, particularly those irradiated at  young ages, face increased risks of solid cancers, 
supporting strategies to promote lifelong surveillance among these patients. (Blood. 2009; 113:1175-
1183). 
 
Secondary MDS/AML of donor origin is also a know n but rare complication following allo-transplant 
[112-115]. This phenomenon is increasingly being rea lized given our ability to do chimerism assays 
to distinguish donor from patient cells.  
 
 
Because of the nonmyeloablative nature of this regimen, is anticipated that recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389651] a conventional myeloablative 
transplant. Because it is possible that infertility ma y occur, we will discuss the possibility of sperm 
banking or egg retrieval with the subject before undergoing the transplant.   
 
Related to the apheresis procedure:    The apheresis procedures will be performed in accordance 
with standard apheresis donation policies and procedures operative in the Dept. of Transfusion 
Medicine and will be in compliance with the Blood Donor Standards of the American Association 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488362] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 50 of Blood Banks and the rules and regulations of the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse 
reactions to apheresis procedures are rare, but include: 
 
x Pain and hematoma at the needle placement site (if done via peripheral access) 
x Vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], characterized by [CONTACT_108684], dizziness, nausea and rarely, 
syncope are seen in less than 2% of the procedures. Hypotension secondary to volume 
depletion is known for the rare potential for a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event.  
x Cutaneous or circumoral parasthesias, chills, nausea, heartburn and rarely muscle spasms 
may result from the use of citrate anticoagulant used to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate reactions are usually relieved by [CONTACT_389705]. 
 
Related to the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System :  Theoretical risks to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389652], user error, or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389653] (i.e. residual 
amounts of unbound CliniMACs CD34 Reagent, iron dextran, or human anti-mouse antibodies).  
For full text see Investigator’s Brochure, Version 7, dated 7/31/2011, section 6, Summary and 
Guidance for the Investigator. 
 
Prior to each apheresis, the potential risks associated with the procedure will be explained to the 
subject and a separate informed consent obtained.  
 
Related to the common transplant related drugs and radiotherapy.  
Antithymocyte globulin : Febrile reactions, allergic symptoms including rash, wheezing, 
anaphylaxis, cytopenias, serum sickness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, hypotension, 
tachycardia, bradycardia, fever, chills, myelos uppression. Several cases of a severe lung injury 
related to Atgam treatment have been reported. Although this side effect appears extremely rare, 
it is serious and can be fatal. There is no information about the mechanism or specific treatment 
for this condition. A few patients recovered after intensive medical support including use of a 
breathing machine.  
 
Cyclophosphamide: Immediate-- tingling and metallic taste, nausea and vomiting, ADH-like 
effect, cardiotoxic at high doses (>70 mg/kg). Rare  -- pulmonary toxicity, urticaria and flushing, 
mucositis Delayed--marrow suppression, nausea, mucositis, rash, hemorrhagic cystitis, 
myocardial damage, alopecia, infertility.  
 
Fludarabine : Myelosuppression, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, 
weakness, and rarely hemolysis and pulmonary toxicity, hemolytic anemia and interstitial 
pneumonitis. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients treated with fludarabine.   
  
Mycophenolate mofetil:  Serious side effects include increased susceptibility to infection and 
possible development of lymphoma, and increased risk of pregnancy loss and congenital 
malformations (external ear and facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies 
of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidney). Nausea, diarrhea, leukopenia, headache, 
weakness, urinary frequency, leg cramps or pai n, liver function test abnormalities, infection 
related to immunosuppression, and skin rash. Hemorrhagic gastritis and pancreatitis have been reported rarely. Malignant neoplasms have been reported in psoriasis patients treated with oral 
mycophenolic acid, although a definite cause-effe ct relationship has not been established.    
Multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by [CONTACT_389706] (10 confirmed and 7 possible cases).  The latent virus is present in about [ADDRESS_488363] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 51 that patients who present with or develop new neurologic signs or symptoms should be evaluated 
for PML. Neurological warning signs include: major changes in vision, unusual eye movements, 
loss of balance or coordination and/or disorienta tion or confusion. There are no known effective 
treatments for PML. 
 
Prednisone:   Sodium retention, hypertension, congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, 
hyperglycemia, increased requirements for insuli n or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetics, 
increased appetite, psychic disturbances, peptic ulcers, and increased risk for opportunistic 
infections.  Long term administration of glucocorticoids may be associated with myopathy, 
cataracts, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, and growth retardation in children. 
 
 Tacrolimus: Acute tacrolimus nephrotoxicity is usually manifested by a moderate decline in renal 
excretory function, which is readily reversible by a decrease in drug dosage.  Although some 
degree of transient renal dysfunction may occur in patients with therapeutic levels of tacrolimus, 
significant renal toxicity is associated with elevat ed trough or steady state levels.  In addition to 
an increase in BUN and creatinine, hyperkalemic hyperchloremic acidosis, low fractional 
excretion of sodium and the onset of hypertension with hypomagnesemia are seen with tacrolimus nephrotoxicity.  Hypertension occurs in up to 60% of patients.  Hypomagnesemia can 
be associated with neurologic symptoms, including seizures, cerebellar ataxia and depression.  
Dose-related hepatotoxicity, manifested by [CONTACT_22697], has 
been reported. 
  Related to antimicrobials in general : Allergic reactions, renal impairment (gentamicin, 
vancomycin, amphotericin, acyclovir), "red man" syndrome (vancomycin), hepatic damage 
(acyclovir, rifampin) , nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, pancytopenia, neutropenia, 
peripheral neuropathy, renal damage (Ganciclovir--reversible on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395]). 
 
 Related to filgrastim (G-CSF):  (See section 14.3.2 below) 
 
Related to the total body radiation : The side effects of radiation have been well described. The most 
common include nausea and mucositis. There also exists a risk of hypothyroidism, cataracts, 
interstitial pneumonitis, nephropathy, and an unspecified long term risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_389654]. Importantly, the majority of the nonneoplastic effects were sub clinical and/or 
reversible.   
Related to fertility:  Although the conditioning regimen uses low dose radiation and chemotherapy 
that usually does not compromise fertility, no data is currently available on the chances that 
subjects will maintain fertility after this type of transplant. Even those who become infertile after 
the transplant may regain fertility with time. 
 
 
14.3.2 The donor  
 
Related to filgrastim (G-CSF):  The hazard to the donor is low. The discomforts from G-CSF 
mobilization and leukapheresis for collection of blood stem cells are probably lower than those 
associated with marrow harvesting. G-CSF has been given to large numbers of normal donors 
without major side effects or long-term conseque nces. The immediate side effects of G-CSF are 
bone pain, fatigue, insomnia, myalgia and headache. These are usually mild and are self-limiting. 
Reversible thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts falling to the region of 100,000 /cu mm is 
frequent. Although regarded as safe and well tolerated, G-CSF administration could result in 
splenic rupture, a potentially life-threatening complication. Five cases of splenic rupture have 
been reported in healthy donors (Becker et al. 1997, Falzetti et al. 1999, Balaguer et al. 2004, 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488364] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 52 Dincer et al. 2004, Nuamah et al. 2006). Donors will be asked to avoid vigorous activities and to 
report any left upper abdominal and/or shoulder pain to the research team or the on-call physician 
for the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine at [PHONE_4366].  
 
Patients with ongoing ischemic heart disease have been reported to have angina seemingly 
temporally-related to G-CSF administration and aphe resis(Vij).  In addition, a rare occurrence of 
pulmonary hemorrhage has been reported in a healthy donor who was a cigarette smoker and had 
underlying pulmonary disease.104 
 
Related to central line placement : It is estimated that about 50% of the donors less than age 18 will 
require intravenous line placement (femoral ve in); and about 50% of those minors will require 
conscious sedation for the line placement procedure to successfully complete apheresis.  Intravenous 
line placement in the femoral vein using a temporary Quentin catheter carries a small risk of 
bleeding, bruising or pain, infection, and a very low risk of accidental injury to the adjacent artery 
and nerve. Some subjects may experience a vasovagal reaction (lightheadedness, or, rarely, fainting 
due to temporary lowering of blood pressure). Using only trained experienced staff for the 
procedure minimizes these risks.  
 
In exceptional instances the donor is required to donate PBPC a third time. There is a minimal 
additional risk that the donation of PBPC on three successive days can increase the possibility of 
thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is transient and unlikely to cause clinical sequelae.  
 
Related to Apheresis : see section 14.3.[ADDRESS_488365] failed or are not eligible for conventional treatments an alternative therapy which may be curative.   The protocol aims to decrease the risk of 
transplant-related mortality associated with U CB transplantation, thus making more patients 
candidates for potentially curative therapy. The risk of death due to complication from the 
allogeneic BMT procedure is justified by [CONTACT_389707]’s SAA or MDS. 
 
 
Therefore, for adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389655], the research involves greater than 
minimal risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit (45 CFR 46.102). 
 
14.4.2 For pediatric transplant subjects   
 
The inclusion of children satisfies the criteria set forth in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46, Subpart D: 46.405 as follows: 
 
 (a) the risk is justified by [CONTACT_32117]: We are offering pediatric 
subjects with debilitating hematologic disorders who have failed or are not eligible for 
conventional treatments an alternativ e therapy which may be curative    
 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488366] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 53 (b) the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that 
presented by [CONTACT_167899]. Cl inically the approach is ethically acceptable 
because the protocol aims to decrease the risk of  transplant-related mortality associated with UCB 
transplantation, thus making patients candidates for potentially curative therapy 
 
 (c) adequate provisions are made for soliciting th e assent of the children and permission of their 
parents or guardians, as set forth in 46.408. 
 
Therefore for pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389655], the research involves greater than 
minimal risk but presents the prospect of direct benefit to the individual subjects (45 CFR 
46.405). 
 
 14.4.3 For adult donors: 
 
An HLA partially matched family member will be co-enrolled into this study as a stem cell 
donor. The stem cell collection aspect of this protocol is not investigational. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_389656], potential benefit does exist for family donors. The donor derives 
psychosocial benefit from donating stem cells both at the time of donation and possibly into the future, especially in view of the reduced life expe ctancy due to this disease in a family member.  
Other potential benefits include detection of il lnesses, determination of blood cell counts, and 
evaluation of kidney and liver function in the potential donor at the time of screening.  
 
 Therefore, participation of adults as a stem cell donors on this protocol involves greater than 
minimal risk but presents the prospect for direct benefit (45 CFR 46.102) .   
 
14.4.4  For pediatric donors: 
 
An HLA partially matched pediatric family member may be co-enrolled on this study as a stem 
cell donor. The stem cell collection aspect of this protocol is not investigational. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_389656], potential benefit does exist for the pediatric donors. The donor 
derives psychosocial benefit from donating stem cells both at the time of donation and possibly 
into the future, especially in view of the reduced life expectancy due to this disease in a family 
member.  Other potential benefits include detecti on of illnesses and evaluation of overall health 
status of the pediatric participant at the time of screening.  
 
Therefore, participation as a stem cell donor on this protocol involves greater than minimal risk 
but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects (45 CRF 46.405). 
 
14.4.5 For pediatric donors – healthy volunteers- involved in laboratory research studie s.   
 
The inclusion of children satisfies the criteria set forth in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 46, 
Subpart D: 46.404 as follows: 
 
(1) The research does not involve greater than minimal risk.  Blood and bone marrow specimens 
for research are obtained concurrently with clinically indicated sampling. Immune cell 
collection will not be permitted in pediatric donors. Therefore, there is no risk associated with sample collection for research because research  will only be performed on material obtained 
during standard research interventions. 
 
Research specimens will be stored in the PI’s laboratory. Samples will be assigned a unique 
code known only to the principal investigator, which will serve as a link to the chil d’s name 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488367] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 54 and clinical information collected as part of this research protocol.  No samples will be 
provided to investigators outside the branch without permission of the IRB, therefore 
confidentiality will be protected. 
 
Only those laboratory tests approved by [CONTACT_389708]. Research will not include genetic testing. Therefore, there is no genetic testing associated risk.  
     
(2) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their 
parents or guardians, as set forth in 46.408.   
 
Therefore, participation of pediatric donors in laboratory research on this protocol involves not 
greater than minimal risk (45 CFR 46.404). 
 
14.5 Informed Consent Processes and Procedures 
 
Adults :  The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the procedure and its 
attendant risks and discomforts will be carefully explained to the subject and a signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto this study.    
 
Minor subjects:    If the subject is a minor, minor assent will be sought.    Where deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_15370], and the child's parent or guardian, the child will also be included in 
all discussions about the trial and a minor's assent will be obtained.  The parent who signs the consent for the minor must be a legally recognized parent or guardian.  The parent or guardian 
will sign on the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child had 
given assent.  When the assent is not age appropriate, the study will be explained to the child and 
the assent will be obtained verbally from the child.   
 
Re-Consent for Minors when they reach the age of majority:  When a pediatric subject 
reaches age 18, continued participation will require re-consenting of the now adult with the 
standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective informed consent has been 
obtained. Should sample or data analysis continue following completion of active participation 
and the subject has reached [ADDRESS_488368].  
 Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d), each of which must be 
addressed in relation to the protocol: 
 
(1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. 
a. Analysis of samples and data from this study involves no additional risks to subjects. 
(2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. 
a. This is an FDA-regulated study and as such, we are mandated to retain all samples, 
once collected, regardless of the age of the subject at the time of collection.  
Retention of these samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects.  
(3) The research could not practicably be carr ied out without the waiver or alteration. 
a. Considering the length of time between a minor’s enrollment and their age of 
majority, it is possible that more than a few subjects may be lost to follow up.  A

the research.  
(4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation. 
a. We only plan to request a waiver of reconsent for those subjects who have been lost 
to follow-up.   
 
Consenting to pregnancy testing  in minors of childbearing age :  The subject will be informed 
during the assent process that for safety, we need to do a pregnancy test.  The subject will also be 
told that if it is positive, we will counsel her and help her tell her parents.  If the minor does not 
want to proceed, she will be advised not to sign the assent and her enrollment on this screening protocol will end. 
 
Minor donors:  Assent will not be sought until an evaluation by a social worker and mental 
health specialist (psychologist or psychiatrist) is completed to determine the minor donor’s 
willingness to participate.    
 
Decisionally impaired:   The IRB will be consulted prior to enrolling any decisionally impaired 
subject (donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]). 
 
Non-English speaking research participants :  We anticipate enrolling non-English speaking 
research participants into this study.  The IRB a pproved full consent document will be translated 
into the subject's native language in accordance with the Clinical MAS Policy M77-2.  If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is no translated extant IRB 
approved consent document, the principal investigat or and or those authorized to obtain informed 
consent will use a short form oral consent process as described in MAS Policy M77-2, 
45CFR46.117(b)(2) and 21CFR50.27(b)(a).  The summary that will be used is the English 
version of the extant IRB approved consent document. 
  
At any time during participation in the protocol that new information becomes available relating 
to risks, adverse events, or toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to all 
enrolled or prospective subject participants.  Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if 
necessary, the informed consent amended to reflect relevant information.

15.0   PHARMACEUTICALS  
 
 15.1     CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System  
 15.1.[ADDRESS_488373]:   The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is a medical device 
that is used in vitro to select and enrich specific cell populations. When using the CD34 Reagent, 
the system selects CD34+ cells from heterogeneous hematological cell populations for 
transplantation in cases where this is clinically indicated. The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is comprised of four primary component s:
  
• CliniMACS CD34 Reagent: a sterile monoclonal antibody reagent specific for CD34+ cells  
• CliniMACS Plus In strument: a software controlled inst rument that processes the blood 
sample (cell product)  
• CliniMACS Tubing Sets: single -use, sterile, disposable tubing sets with two proprietary cell 
selection columns (CliniMACS Tubing Set and CliniMACS Tubing Set LS)  
• CliniMACS PBS/EDTA Buffer: a sterile, isotonic phosphate -buffered, 1 mM EDTA, saline 
solution, used as external wash and transport fluid for the in vitro preparation of blood cells  
 
15.1.2 Physical, chemical and toxicological information  
x CD34 Reagent description:   The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent is a dark amber, 
nonviscous, colloidal solution containing the antibody conjugate in buffer. The conjugate 
consists of a monoclonal antibody towards the class II epi[INVESTIGATOR_16164]34 
antigen. The murine monoclonal IgG1 antibody is covalently linked to dextran beads that 
have an iron oxide/hydroxide core and are superparamagnetic.  
x Safety testing of the CD34 monoclonal antibody:  Cell banking, cell culture, as well as 
subsequent purification of the antibody, fo llow the applicable current international 
guidelines. The testing of the CD34 Master Cell Bank, the End of Production Cells, the 
CD34 mAb pooled cell culture harvest (unprocessed bulk) and the purified CD34 monoclonal antibody (mAb) have been completed and the purified CD34 mAb has been 
released for manufacturing of the CD34 Reagent. Additionally, the viral 
inactivation/removal steps used in the purification of the CD34 monoclonal antibody 
have been validated. 
 
x Safety testing of the CD34 Reagent: Detailed toxicity studies have been undertaken to 
assess the safety of the CD34 Reagent when delivered in dosages significantly greater than the projected maximum dosage anticipated in clinical use. The testing was 
performed in accordance with 21 CFR §58, Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical 
Laboratory Studies. A summary of this testin g is provided in the following table.

15.1.3 Safety testing of CliniMACS® System components (Instrument, Tubing Sets and PBS/EDTA 
Buffer) Biocompatibility testing of the CliniMACS System components (Tubing Sets and 
PBS/EDTA Buffer) was performed according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]. The requirements of ISO [ADDRESS_488376] been reduced by [CONTACT_2329] a design to meet European standards EN [ZIP_CODE]-1. It is UL and CSA listed and approved.  
 
15.1.4 Overall safety of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System:  The results summarized in the 
Investigator’s Brochure support that CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is sufficiently safe for 
clinical use with human subjects. The potential application of the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent is 
broad. Infusion of purified CD34+ cells is indicated in a number of clinical applications after myeloablative or lymphoablative therapy including reduction of tumor cells in the transplant and 
depletion of T cells for autologous (autoimmune diseases) and allogeneic transplantations.  
Individual risk analysis on the therapeutically us ed target cells isolated in conjunction with 
CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System should be addressed by [CONTACT_16172].  
 
The BMT CTN #0303 Study entitled “A Single Arm, Multicenter Phase II Trial of Transplants of 
HLA-Matched, CD34+ Enriched, T-cell Depleted Peripheral Blood Stem Cells Isolated by [CONTACT_389709]” was performed in conjunction with th e Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials 
Network (BMT CTN). This multi-center, phase II study was performed to support the probable 
benefit of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System for processing hematopoietic progenitor cells-
apheresis (HPC-A) to obtain a CD34 positive cell enriched population intended to provide for 
hematopoietic reconstitution following a myeloablative preparative regimen without the need for additional graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophyla xis in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
(AML) in first or second morphologic complete remission. 
 
The BMT CTN #0303 Study was designed to provide extensive T-cell Depletion (TCD) using the 
CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System, to elimin ate the requirement for post-transplant 
pharmacological GVHD prophylaxis in adult patients with AML in first or second CR 
undergoing a myeloablative transplant from a matched related donor. The goal was to 
demonstrate that the side effects of T-cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HCT) would be reduced if combined with a conditioning regimen that was highly 
immunosuppressive and anti-leukemic. The primary objective was to achieve a disease-free 
survival (DFS) rate at six months post-transplant that exceeded 75%. Secondary objectives 
included assessments of engraftment, overall survival, EBV reactivation, transplant-related 
 
 
08-H-[ADDRESS_488377] Childs, M.D. May 13, 2019 (Amendment OO) 
 58 mortality (TRM), acute and chronic GVHD, relapse and performance of the CliniMACS® CD34 
Reagent System. 
 
Forty-seven patients were enrolled and 44 transplanted at eight different centers in the BMT CTN 
network. The mean age was 46.3 years with 28 female and 16 male patients. Of the 37 AML 
CR1patients on protocol, 27% had an unfavorable cytogenetic or molecular risk profile. The conditioning regimen consisted of hyperfractionated total body irradiation (1375cGy in eleven 
fractions) with partial lung shielding, thiotepa (10 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), and 
rabbit antithymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg). The donors, all HLA-identical siblings, were given 
GCSF for mobilization and scheduled to undergo at least 2 leukapheresis procedures to ensure a 
graft with a high CD34+ cell content. All allograf ts were CD34 enriched and were targeted to 
contain > 5.0 x106 CD34+ cells/kg and < 1.0 x 105 CD3+ cells/kg. No pharmacological GVHD 
prophylaxis was given post-transplant. 
 
The primary endpoint of the trial was met, in that the probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 
six months post transplantation was 81.8% for al l transplanted patients. Additionally, the data 
from the study showed that the performance of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System was safe 
and consistent in this multicentric trial because of the reproducible, passive depletion of CD3+ cells (median 4.8 log10 depletion), the enrichment of CD34+ cells, through the sterility of the 
transplanted grafts and the absence of infusional toxicity and attributable adverse events and low 
rates of acute and chronic GVHD without the need for additional post-transplant GVHD 
prophylaxis. 
 A European safety study, ACS 950101, for the CliniMACS System was published in Bone 
Marrow Transplantation 25; 243-49, February [ZIP_CODE]. The study was designed to meet European 
Essential Requirements 3 and 14 (MDD 93/42/EEC) and was conducted per EN540 to support the 
CE Marking of the device (received December 1997). 
 
The initial clinical study with the CliniMACS System was conducted in subjects undergoing high-
dose chemotherapy for breast cancer. The purpose of the European Safety Study was to show:  
 
x Suitability of the CD34 Reagent and other CliniMACS components for selection 
ofCD34+cells with high, yield, purity viability and safety  
x CD34+ cells can safely be administered to subjects after myeloablative chemotherapy  
x Selected CD34+ cells are effective in reco nstituting the hematopoietic system after 
myeloablative chemotherapy  
x Rate of device failures  
 
Cells were isolated from leukapheresis products from sixty-five subjects enrolled in the study. 
Fifty-four subjects received selected CD34+ cells and fifty-two were evaluable for engraftment as 
summarized in Table 2 (one subject died [ADDRESS_488378] did not recover platelet counts even after back-up cells were infused). All subjects receiving 
selected cells completed 60 and 100-day follow-up after infusion, during which time their 
hematological and immune status were monitored, as was human murine antibodies (HAMA) 
production. A summary of the results of the European clinical trial is provided below.

The following conclusions were made regarding this clinical study:  
 
• The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System selects CD34+ cells from heterogeneous 
hematological cell populations. The resulting CD34+ product is of high purity (median of 96.1 %, range 27.4 – 99.4 %); the median recovery of CD34+ cells was 52.3 % (range 15.2 – 
146.3%). The reported performance results are similar to those seen in pre-clinical studies.  
• Infusion of selected, autologous CD34+ cells after high dose chemotherapy resulted in rapid 
engraftment (see Table 2). These data are comparable to previously reported results, using 
bone marrow or peripheral blood cells as st em cell source. Following cyclophosphamide, 
thiotepa and carboplatin (CTCb), Weaver et al. reported median times to platelet and 
neutrophil engraftment of 9 days (range 0-53 days) and 9 days (range 5-26 days), 
respectively. Also after CTCb, Elias et al., reported median times to platelet and neutrophil 
recovery of 12 days (range 8-134 days) and 14 days (range 10-57 days), respectively 
(Elias et 
al., 1992; Weaver et al., 1995) .  
• The selection process has no discernable effect on cell viability or sterility.  
• There were no adverse events or devic e malfunctions reported as related to the infusion of the 
cells or use of the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System. None of the subjects were reactive for 
HAMA post infusion. There were no reports of late engraftment failure or evidence of delayed 
immune reconstitution.

 73 APPENDIX B Grading of GVHD 
 
GVHD is staged based on degree of severity of skin, liver and gastrointestinal (GI) tract involvement ranging 
from mild to severe (table 1).  Acute GVHD is then graded for prognostic and treatment purposes based on a 
four-grade scale, with grade I considered mild, grade II  as moderate, grade III as severe, and grade IV being a 
life-threatening (Table 2).  The likelihood of severe and life-threatening acute GVHD increases with the degree of mismatch between the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens of the donor and those of 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389664], cytomegalovirus (CMV) donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_389665], underlying disease, conditioning regimen and type of GVHD prophylaxis.  For the purposes of 
secondary endpoint assessment the following grading schemas will be used:

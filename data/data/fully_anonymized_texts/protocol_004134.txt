1. Background and Significance  
1.1 Scope of Problem  
The proportion of U.S. drivers witnessed visibly manipulating hand -held devices while driving has 
doubled since 2010 (NHTSA 2014), despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] 97% of Americans know this is dangerous (AT&T 
2012) and texting while driving is illegal in all but four states. Current policies to curb cellphone use while 
driving have had limited impact because they do not address the underlying impulsivity ( Hayashi, 2015)  
that causes drivers to continue to engage in this behavior despi[INVESTIGATOR_442615] 
(Delgado 2016).  
1.2 Existing Interventions  
In November 2016, NHTSA released guidelines recommending the use of operating systems, 
aftermarket ap plications, and devices to enable a “driver mode” on smartphones to limit use while driving 
(Department of Transportation 2016). Akin to the federally mandated use of an “airplane mode” intended to 
limit cellular transmissions during air travel, a driver m ode can be implemented on cellphones automatically 
limiting handheld cellphone use over certain speed thresholds consistent with driving based on native 
phone sensors or Bluetooth pairing with in -vehicle devices. These settings and applications have 
custom izable configurations that can be programmed to acti vate when the car is moving, including locking 
the phone screen, silencing notifications, blocking incoming calls and text messages, and sending 
automated responses to incoming text messages. Research on these applications supports the efficacy of 
blocking technology on significantly reducing phone calls and text messaging while driving compared to 
control groups (Creaser et al. 2015; Ebel et al. 2015; Funkhouser and Sayer 2013). Third -party 
smartphone app lications that enable a driver mode are also available for download (“Using Technology” 
2014), but adoption and use have been limited. Though reasons for limited adoption have not been 
examined in the peer -review literature, media reports suggest that this  is due to limited con sumer 
acceptability (Richtel 2016). A recent study examining the adoption of similar smartphone apps to monitor 
and provide feedback on driving behavior among young drivers showed that perceived gains (e.g., financial 
incentives) and social norms are the biggest motivating factors in adoption of these applications . June 5, 
2017, Apple (Cupertino, CA) announced a “do not disturb while driving mode” that became available as an 
iPhone operating system feature in Fall 2017 that can be turn ed on to lock the phone screen and silence 
and send automated responses to incoming text messages while driving (Sinder 2017).  
Applications and settings aimed at limiting cellphone use while driving will only be effective from a 
population health standpoin t if widely adopted  and sustainably used. A promis ing approach to increased 
adoption of these applications and settings to sustainably change behavior is to increase perceived gains 
of these actions by [CONTACT_442623] (Kervick et al. 2015; M usicant and Lotan 2016). This 
could be brought to scale through usage -based auto insurance programs that  use mobile telematic 
smartphone apps to provide insurance discounts based on monitored driving and phone use behavior 
(Delgado et al. 2016). The ef fectiveness of financial incen tive strategies in usage -based insurance 
programs could be enhanced by [CONTACT_442624], as has been effective for 
health behavior change (Delgado et al. 2016). This includes increasing the frequency a nd salience     of 
incentives , to be more averse to losses than to gains . (Asch and Rosin 2016; Loewenstein et al. 2007, 
2013). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_442616], such strategies have not been tested previously.   
 
1.[ADDRESS_562239] demonstrated 
how a variety of common decision  errors such as status quo bias, present bias (tendency to overweight 
immediate costs and benefits over future), loss aversion, regret aversion, and social norms, can be used to 
develop effective, high impact interventions for health behavior change. Our w ork has led to the 
development of a new health plan (Humana Simplicity), the enrollment process for automatic medication 
refills at CVS Health, financial incentives and smoking cessation programs among employees at General 
Electric and CVS. Further transla ting our deep expertise in behavioral economics to reducing cellphone 
use while driving could lead to a transformational paradigm shift in the approach to behavior change for 
this emerging cause of injury and risky driving in general.  
1.[ADDRESS_562240] designed the interventions to be tested in our field experiment  with several elements 
based on behavioral economic theory (Lowenstein, Volpp 2007), including: (1) promoting restraint from 
using a cellphone while driving by [CONTACT_1541] a substitute reinforcer in the form of incentives; (2) delivering 
incentives on a week ly basis to offset a heightened tendency to favor immediate gratification over delayed 
benefits among those who engage in texting while driving; (3) providing feedback via smartphones 
regarding accrued losses from non -adherence to maximize regret aversion;  (4) framing reward -based 
incentives as losses to augment motivation through loss aversion; leveraging ; and  (5) social network theory 
and evidence that behavior change programs may be more effective when individuals are co mpared to 
those similar to them.  
  
2. TRIAL DESIGN  
2.[ADDRESS_562241] a randomized, control trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness of 
social comparison and financial incentive interventions with customers of Progressive’s mobile 
phone usage -based insurance policy.  A total of 3,[ADDRESS_562242] an attrition rate of 17% based on historical customer data .  
2.2 Setting  
The study will be conducted by [CONTACT_442625]. Progressive will be responsible for recruiting participants from their newly enrolled 
group of Snapshot customers. TrueMotion will be responsible for conducting study procedures 
including interventions, data collection, and participant payments.  Penn researchers will be 
responsible for study design and data analysis.  
2.3 Inclusion Criteria

1. Progressive Snapshot Users with policy activated within recruitment period  
 
2. Progressive Snapshot policy holder in one of the following states and regions: MI, PA, TX, FL, 
TN, OR, GA, NE, OK, OH, MT, MO, NV, CT, WI, MD, KY, MN, NH, NJ, AZ, ME, LA, SC, CO, MS, 
IN, IA, AL, ND, UT, RI, WV, WY, IL, AR, DE, KS, SD, NM, VT, ID, and the District of Columbia  
 
3. Has an email address  
 
 Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Progressive Snapshot Mobile App not updated to enable push notifications  
 
2. Customer’s residential address is in a state in which phone use while driving is factored into 
insurance rating  
 
3. Customer’s Snapshot Mobile App does not co llect trip data with all sensors active  
 
4. Customer in Snapshot program for < 30 days or more > [ADDRESS_562243] Information  
 The research team and tech nology  team at the University of Penn sylvania and TrueMotion  (TMO) , 
respectively , will not have access to participant information.  Progressive will send invites with a Globally 
Unique Identifier (GUID) attached to the  enrollment link. Progressive will send a list of GUID s to TM O who 
will use these GUID s to identify participants. TrueMotion will pair those GUID s with participant emails that 
are given by [CONTACT_442626]. When participants en roll in the study, on the 
website hosted by [CONTACT_442627], they will have to provide their e -mail address to receive their compensation. 
TrueMotion will use the email  addresses provided by [CONTACT_442628]  a treatment arm that receives monetary incentives. Participants that have any issues or 
concerns during the study will be prompted to conta ct the study team via email at 
[EMAIL_8509] .  
2.7. Baseline  
All new Progressive Snapshot customers will be monitored for 30-[ADDRESS_562244] demographic data on the 
participant’s  age, marita l status, gender, occupation, highest educational level, residential ZIP code, and  
urban, suburban , rural classification of the residential ZIP code  (Kolko 2015) . 
Survey  
After participants opt -in to the study, they will be prompted to complete a n intake survey hosted by 
[CONTACT_442629]. This will collect data on their vehicle characteristics (e.g. Bluetooth connectivity, GPS 
navigation), driving history  (e.g. length of licensure) , self-reported phone use while driving , perceptions of 
level phone use rel ative to others like t hem, use of settings to limit distracted driving (e.g. Do Not Disturb 
While Driving), and general behavioral characteristics  (e.g. 5 -trial delay discounting scale) .  
2.9. Allocation to Treatment  
Progressive Snapshot users that opt -in to participate will be added to a study lis t tracked by [CONTACT_442627].  
3,[ADDRESS_562245] enrolled into the s tudy, they will complete an intake survey, collecting information 
about driving history, demographics, and behavioral characteristics. Simple individual -level randomization 
will be used. TrueMotion will use a random number generator to randomize each user that opts in to 1 of 
the 6 arms: ( Arm 1 ) control, ( Arm 2 ) social comparison feedback , (Arm 3)  end of rating period incentive , 
(Arm 4 ) end of rating period incentive and social comparison feedback  (Arm 5 ) weekly loss framed 
incentive and social comparison feedback , (Arm 6)  larger weekly loss framed incentive and social 
comparison feedback . Intervention will be delivered by [CONTACT_442630]. Additionally, iPhone users in all arms wi ll get push notifications prompting them to 
activate the Do Not Disturb While Driving setting on iPhones.

2.10.2 Exit Survey  
Using Study ID#, Progressive will send an email to study participants with a link to an exit survey hosted by 
[CONTACT_442631] 3-[ADDRESS_562247] any scenarios where emergency 
unblinding will be necessary.  
2.13. Compensation  
Participants will be compensated $10 for completing the intake survey and $10 for completing the End of 
Study Survey. Arms 3 -6 will receive  compensation based on their driving scores. Participants will be 
scored based on historical demographic data that has been split into 3 buckets: 1) low performers (<50%); 
2) average performs 50 -89%; 3) top performers >90% . 
2.14. Regulatory  
This study is I RB exempt. The Penn research team will not receive any PHI or identifiable information  and 
all trial procedures and participant payments will be conducted and dispersed by [CONTACT_442627]. The trial is 
minimal risk  to participants, given that the only possible risk will be from potential breach of confidenti ality. 
TrueMotion will not have identifiable information of participants  other than email address for communication 
and study payments . Regarding user driving data, Progressive will send a global unique identifier (GUID) 
to TrueMotion. TrueMotion will pair those GUIDs with those that have enrolled into the study.  This way, 
TrueMotion will not have name/demographic data of participants connected with their Progressive 
Snapshot driving data.  TrueMotion will  send the list of enrolled GUIDS to Progressive. Only Progressive 
will have demographic information regarding which of their participants have enrolled into the study. 
Participants will voluntary provide their email address to TrueMotion to receive compens ation .  
The study has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov under [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
2.15. Contingencies and Participant Withdrawal  
If a participant withdraws from the study, further communication will be stopped. Data collected prior to 
withdrawal will be mainta ined but additional data will not be collected.

3. OUTCOMES  
3.1. Definitions  
3.1.1. Primary Outcome  
Seconds of active handheld phone use per hour of driving .  This is a composite outcomes that 
measures the proportion of total trip time in which the customer is engaged in handheld phone call use or 
non-call handheld use (e.g. texting, swipi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) as measured by [CONTACT_442632].  
Several studies (e.g. Klauer, NEJM , 2014) h ave demonstrated the association between handheld phone 
use, such reaching for phone, typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], swipi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dialing, and increased crash risk. This outcome is also 
known as the active phone use percentage . Passive phone use (e.g. phone is streaming GPS navigati on 
directions or music without any typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], swipi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and handheld holding of the phone) is not included in this 
outcome.  Customers are able to view their active phone use percentage for each trip in the Snapshot 
Mobile app.  Trips are only counted if the S napshot Mobile app predicts the customer was a driver for the 
trip based on the phone sensor data. In the Snapshot Mobile program, customers can open the Snapshot 
app and reclassify trips from driver trips to passenger trips and vice versa for up to 5 days .  This outcome 
is currently not used to calculate future auto -insurance rates and discounts among eligible study 
participants.

3.1.2. Secondary  Outcomes  - Effectiveness  
Seconds of active handheld call use per hour of driving .  We will analyze the components of the 
primary outcome separately.   
Seconds of active handheld non -call use per hour of driving .  We will analyze the components of the 
primary outcome separately.   
Hard breaking events per  [ADDRESS_562248] accelera tion events per 100 miles .  This is measured by [CONTACT_442633], reported for 
each trip, and used to calculate future auto -insurance rates and discounts.   
 
3.1.3. Secondary Outcome 2  – Cost Effectiveness  
Increme ntal Cost -Effectiveness Ratio. We will measure the incremental cost -effectiveness of the 
intervention arms relative to th e control arm and to each other.  This will be done by [CONTACT_442634]-effectiveness ratios as follows:  
[(Incentive Costs in Intervention Arm ) – (Incentive Costs in Comparison Arm) ] / [(Seconds of active 
handhel d use / hour of driving  in Intervention Arm) – (Seconds of active handheld use / hour of driving  in 
Comparison  Arm)]  
 
3.1.4. Secondary Outcome 3  - Acceptability  
Acceptability of interventions will be measured using a mixed -methods approach:  
Snapshot Mobile  app notifications disabled.  Given the eligible participants will have notifications 
enabled, if a customer disables notifications, this could indicate a lack of acceptability of push notification 
interventions.   
Net promoter score. In the exit survey, participants will be asked  “How likely is it that you would 
recommend the intervention you received to a friend or colleague? ”  on a 0 to 10 scale.  
Responses to open -ended questions in exit survey.   Participants  will be asked the following two open -
ended q uestions: 1)  “Please tell us what you  liked about participating in this study;”  2) “Please tell us 
what  didn’t like  about participating in this study and how we should improve the experience in the future. ”  
These qualitative responses will be coded for co ntent related to intervention acceptability and emerging 
themes will be identified by [CONTACT_63615].   
 
4. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
4.1. Analytic Methods  
The primary outcome is seconds of active handheld phone use per hour of driving , which can also be 
expressed as active phone use %.  We will use logistic regression as our primary analytic model to assess 
effectiveness between and among the 5 interventions. Specifically, we will evaluate these 10 predefined  
contrasts : 
1. Social Comparison  Feedback versus C ontrol (monitor only)  
2. End of Rating Period I ncentive versus C ontrol (monitor only)  
3. End o f Rating period Incentive + Social C omparison Feedback  versus C ontrol (monitor only)  
4. Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison F eedback  versus Control (monitor only)  
5. Larger Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison F eedback  versus C ontrol (monitor 
only)  
6. End of Rating Period In centive  versus Social Comparison Fe edback  
7. End o f Rating Period I ncentive + Social C omparison Feedback versus Social Comparison 
Feedback  
8. End o f Rating Period Incentive + Social C omparison Feedback versus End of Rating Period 
Incentive  
9. Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison Fe edback  versus End of Rating Period 
Incentive  + Social Comparison F eedback  
10. Larger Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison Fe edback  versus Weekly Loss -Framed 
Incentive + Social Comparison F eedback  
Although longitudinal models such as generalized estimating equations might be considered in light of the 
repeated measures among ind ividual participants, logistic regression is preferred in this case because the 
primary outcome collapses to a number between 0 and 1 . The model will be adjusted for: 1) length of time 
in the Snaphshot program program during the Baseline period; 2) and obs erved primary outcome during 
the Baseline period.   
Due to the multiple pre -planned contrasts, we will adjust for multiple comparisons using the Holm method.  
First, the 10  contrasts will be ranked (lowest to highest) based on the raw p -value from the logistic 
regression. For a contrast to be significant using the Holm threshold, the raw p -value must be below the 
threshold for each row calculated as  (0.05 / [n remaining cons trasts]).  Correspondingly, for clarity of 
presentation, adjusted p values will be reported by [CONTACT_442635] p value by [CONTACT_442636]. For example, the smallest p -value is multiplied by [ADDRESS_562249] a clinically meaningful reduction of 60 seconds/hour of driving (i.e. an absolute reduction in 
phone use % of 1.67%), the minimum sample size is 2,406 (401 per arm).  
With a target sample size of  3,[ADDRESS_562250] a difference between 
treatment arms of 52 seconds/hour of driving (i.e. an absolute reduction in phone use % of 1.44%).  We 
would have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_562251] a difference of 60 seconds/hour of drivin g.   
These estimates should be conservative as adding the rich set of baseline covariates (e.g. demographics, 
Apple car play, etc) to the model should increase the precision of the model estimates.   
 
4.3. Subgroup Analyses  and Effect Modification  
For the [ADDRESS_562252] any study data and will receive de -identified data to analyze outcomes.  
5.2. Variabl es 
Measure library is included in the Appendix  
5.3. Data Quality and Validity  
Data quality and validity will be optimized by [CONTACT_2329] a detailed data dictionary which will be distributed to 
TrueMotion. Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_442637].  
5.4 Transfer of Data  
Study data, including survey data and driving data will be de -identified (email address removed) and 
transferred to the UPenn research via an encrypted .csv file uploaded to a secure, cloud based data 
storage system hosted on PMACs servers. The file will be password protected and the password will be 
provided to the research team via telephone.  
Demographic data from Progressive will be transferred in the same manner.  
Demographic data will be matched with study  data using a study ID # assigned to each participant . 
5.5. Data Storage and Security  
Any datasets and computer files are referred to by [CONTACT_40337]. The study ID is als o used on all analytical files. 
The Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services (PMACS) will store all data securely sent to the Penn 
research team. The data center is housed in Information Systems and Computing at [ADDRESS_562253] will be stored 
on the secure/firewalled servers of the PMACS Data Center, in data files that will be protected by [CONTACT_442638]. These data servers are main tained in a guarded facility behind several locked doors, with 
very limited physical access rights. They are also cyber -protected by [CONTACT_372485]. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by U Penn system managers.  
This multi -layer system of data security, identical to the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania 
Health Systems medical records, greatly minimizes the risk of loss of privacy.  
 
6. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
6.1. Risks to Human Subject s 
This project proposes minimal risk. There is a risk of breach of confidentiality for participants receiving 
study information from TrueMotion.  For the Penn research team  project is primarily a data assessment of 
an existing dataset, and all information u sed was gathered previously by [CONTACT_442639] -identified.  
6.2. Adequacy of Protection Against Risk  
Participants are Progressive Insurance Snapshot® customers that have the Snapshot® app downloaded 
onto their mobile devices. Customers have agreed to have data sharing and location services turned on. 
These users have previously agreed to Snapshot® terms of service 
(https://www.progressive.com/support/legal/snapshot -app-terms -conditions /?theme=neutral) and privacy 
statement ( https://www.progressive.com/support/legal/snapshot -privacy -statement/ ). Progressive will 
assign a Research ID to each Study Partic ipant. Progressive and TrueMotion will not disclose to the 
University the key for the association of Study Participant to Research ID.  Data will be transferred between 
research partners using encryption and password protection, as described in section 5.4.  
The University of P ennsylvania research team will not have access or hold any PHI for any of these users. 
All user names have been de -identified . Prior to sharing the data with us TrueMotion  will remove identifiers 
(email address).   
6.2.1.  Recruitment and  Informed Consent  
Progressive will designate a cohort of customers to invite to study on Day 30 to 70  of their Snapshot Mobile 
enrollment. This will be the “Eligible Cohort.”  
Progressive will send an email to a subset of its customers who use the App with an invitation to participate 
in the Research by [CONTACT_442640]. The email will contain a link to 
a TrueMotion landing page specific to the Research and will contain a GUID. Once such a Progressive 
customer consent s to participate, that customer will be considered a Study Participant for purposes of this 
study, until such time as a Study Participant elects to opt -out of participation. Progressive will assign the 
Study  ID to each Study Participant.  TrueMotion will pr ovide Progressive with the GUID for each Study 
Participant and Progressive will then provide to TrueMotion the Study  ID associated with such GUID.  
Those interested will follow a link that takes them to a website hosted by [CONTACT_442641]. Those that wish to participate will opt -in to enroll online through the website 
hosted by [CONTACT_442627] . 
6.2.2.  Protection against Risk  
In order to protect study participants form potential risks related to the loss of confidentia lity and due to any 
discomfort that they may experience in answering any questions, the following steps will be taken: 1) 
Participants  will be told that they can withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_442642]. 2) All 
information provided by [CONTACT_442643] a subject ID#. The participant’s  ID# can only 
be connected to  their identifiable information  only through GUID mappi[INVESTIGATOR_442619]. The 
Penn research team will have no access to PHI.  All data and files will be entered on computers protected 
by [CONTACT_442644] a locked office. 3) All research staff will be trained in the  importance of 
maintaining confidentiality and will undergo annual mandatory training of human subjects’  research. 4) All 
participant  data will be presented in aggregate and no individuals will be identified individually.  
 
6.2.3.  Potential Benefits to Ind ividual Participants  
This information could allow the research team and Progressive to gain insight about effective usage 
based insurance (UBI) program strategies for reducing distraction from phone use while driving.  
 
7. MONITORING  
7.1. Institutional Revi ew Board (IRB)  
This study has been approved as  an IRB exempt protocol.  
7.2. Data Safety and Monitoring  
The limited data collected by [CONTACT_442645]-identified and manually 
uploaded by [CONTACT_442646] .CSV files. Data will not be analyzed  in real 
time.  It will be securely stored on the study investigator's computers on a Penn Medicine secure network 
server using password protection and e ncryption. All data received will be de -identified and will remain de -
identified. All data obtained in the study will be used exclusively for the purposes of the proposed research. 
Users of this platform have been assigned a Study ID#  and no identifiers wi ll be contained in this file. This 
data  will be  linked  by a  programmer utilizing  coded  study IDs and operating  behind  a  University  
firewall.  The dataset is blinded of all personally identifiable information . (Variables in Appendix)

B. Final Statistical Analysis Plan  
1. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
1.1. Analytic Methods  
The primary outcome is seconds of active handheld phone use per hour of driving , which can 
also be expressed as active phone use %.  We will use fractional regression  with a logit link 
function as our primary analytic model to assess effectiveness between and among the 5 
interventions. Specifically, we will evaluate these 10 predefined  contrasts : 
1. Social Comparison Feedback versus C ontrol (monitor only)  
2. End of Rating Period I ncentive versus Control (monitor only)  
3. End o f Rating period Incentive + Social C omparison Feedback  versus Control (monitor only)  
4. Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison F eedback  versus Control (monitor only)  
5. Larger Weekly Loss -Framed Incen tive + Social Comparison F eedback  versus Control 
(monitor only)  
6. End of Rating Period In centive  versus Social Comparison Fe edback  
7. End o f Rating Period Incentive + Social C omparison Feedback versus Social Comparison 
Feedback  
8. End o f Rating Period Incentive + Social C omparison Feedback versus End of Rating Period 
Incentive  
9. Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison Fe edback  versus End of Rating Period 
Incentive  + Social Comparison F eedback  
10. Larger Weekly Loss -Framed Incentive + Social Comparison Fe edback  versus Weekly Loss -
Framed Incentive + Social Comparison F eedback  
Although longitudinal models such as generalized estimating equations might be considered in light 
of the repeated trip measures among individual participants, fractional regression with a logit link is 
preferred in this case because the primary outcome collapses to a proportion between 0 and 1 that 
is weighted by [CONTACT_442649] . Furthermore, weekly feedback messages and 
incentives are delivered based on the weekly averages  of seconds of active handheld phone use 
time divided by [CONTACT_442650].  The model will be adjusted for: 1) length of time in the 
Snaphshot program during the Baseline period; 2) and observed primary outcome during the 
Baseline period.  Other cova riates to be included in the model include:  
 
1. Proposed baseline covariates to be included in primary outcome analysis model  
2. Baseline period active phone use % (i.e. total active handheld phone use seconds / total trip  
seconds)  
3. Proportion of period active  phone use % due to handheld calls vs. handheld non -call use  
4. Mean hours of driving/week during baseline period  
5. Age 
6. Sex 
7. Marital status  
8. Urban -suburban -rural residence  
9. Residence in state with universal handheld ban  
10. Race/ethnicity  
11. Income  
12. Education level 
13. Phone type (iPhone vs. Android)  
14. Baseline use of automated Do Not Disturb While Driving setting (Y/N)  
15. Bluetooth/USB car connectivity (Y/N)  
16. Dashboard touchscreen (Y/N)  
17. Frequency of letting passenger use phone  
18. Frequency of riding as a passenger  
19. Number of prior traffic violations in prior [ADDRESS_562257], the 10 contrasts will be ranked (lowest to highe st) based on the raw p -value from the 
logistic regression. For a contrast to be significant using the Holm threshold, the raw p -value must 
be below the threshold for each row calculated as (0.05 / [ n remaining contrasts]).  
Correspondingly, for clarity of presentation, adjusted p values will be reported by [CONTACT_442635] 
p value by [CONTACT_442651]. For example,  the smallest p -value is multiplied by [ADDRESS_562258] a clinically meaningful reduction of a 2% difference in amount of 
trip time spent actively using a phone (72 seconds/hour of driving), the minimum sample size is 
1,842 (301 per arm).  
With a target sample size of 3,[ADDRESS_562259] a difference 
between treatment arms of 52 seconds/hour of driving (i.e. an absolute reduction in phone use % of 
1.44%).  We would have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_562260] a difference of 60 seconds/hour of driving.   
Proposed variables to be considered as effect modifiers in the primary analysis  
1. iPhone vs. Android.  Hypothesis: the relative reductions in active handheld phone use 
will be greater among those with iPhones due to the notification to encourage Do Not 
Disturb While Driving.  
2. Quartile of baseline period active phone use % (i.e. total active handheld phone use 
seconds / total trip seconds).  Hypothesis: the relative reductions in active hand held 
phone use while be greater  among those in the highest quartile of baseline phone 
use due to greatest opportunity for improvement and least opportunity for 
improvement in the lowest quartiles.   
3. Proportion of period active phone use % due to handheld calls vs. handheld non -call 
use. Hypothesis: the relative reductions in active hand held phone use while be 
greater among those with a greater proportion of handheld phone use due handheld 
call use vs. non -call use due to multiple available technological means to switch to 
handsfree cal ls. 
4. Proposed variables to be considered as effect modifiers in hypothesis 
generating secondary analyses  
5. Baseline use of automated Do Not Disturb While Driving setting (Y/N)  
6. Baseline use of a phone mount  
7. Mean hours of driving/week during baseline perio d 
8. Age 
9. Sex 
10. Marital status  
11. Urban -suburban -rural residence  
12. Residence in state with universal handheld ban

14. Education level  
 
These estimates should be conservative as adding the rich set of baseline covariates (e.g. 
demographics, Apple Car Play, etc) to the model should increase the precision of the model 
estimates.   
1.3. Subgroup Analyses , Effect Modification, and Mediation Analysis  
 For the [ADDRESS_562261] a mediation analysis to determine whether activation of an automated Do Not 
Disturb While Driving setting during the trial as measure on intake and exit surveys mediates the 
primary outcome by [CONTACT_442652].   
4.4 Sensitivity Analyses  
The primary analysis will only include trip data classified as driver trips.  It is possible that the 
interventions may cause customers to reclassify some driver trips to passenger trips within the 
allowable window of 5 days within t he Snapshot Program.  This may be done to: 1) appropriately to 
correct an incorrect classification by [CONTACT_442653]; or 2) to inappropriately drop driver trips with 
high levels of phone distraction from being factored in the performance calculations in the 
intervention arms.  Therefore we will assess the robustness of the primary results to the inclusion 
and exclusion of driver trips that participants reclassified to passenger trips in both the baseline and 
intervention periods.   
4.[ADDRESS_562262] modifiers and delineated those that will 
be considered in the primary analysis with h ypothesized directions and the others to be considered

during the trial mediates differences in the primary  outcome by [CONTACT_199520].  15. Number of prior traffic violations in prior 5 years

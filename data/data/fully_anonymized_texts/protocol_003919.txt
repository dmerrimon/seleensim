 17  4. INTRODUCTION  
Every year in the [LOCATION_002], approximately 45,000 patients experience burns that require 
them to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], and of those individuals approximately 10 to 20% require surgical 
intervention such as autografti ng (American Burn, 2016 ). Depending upon the severity of the 
injury , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_363870]. Based on data in the [ADDRESS_453298] of Columbia between 2008 and 2017, representing a cross -section of US 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] , the average length of stay for survivors was slightly greater than 1 day per %TBSA 
burned (American Burn Association, 2017 ).  
After stabilization of the critical care issues in those who sustain a burn -injury, attention is 
directed toward burn wound management. The ultimate aim of burn w ound management is to 
prevent wound infection and facilitate closure of the wounds, either spontaneously or by 
[CONTACT_363892]. Key elements of burn wound management include cleansing, 
debridement and/or surgical excision,  and application topi[INVESTIGATOR_363871].  
Regardless of the age of the patient, evidence suggests that early excision of burn eschar is 
effective in decreasing morbidity, improving the mortality rate and reducing length of stay  
(Mull er, 1994 ; Herndon, 1989 ), as well as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]  (Munster, 1994 ). Excised areas are 
usually closed with autograft, or if not available, allograft, xenograft or other skin substitute  is 
used until autograft is available or the wound spontan eously closes. Availability of autologous 
donor tissue , however, is limited by [CONTACT_363893], and in larger injuries, donor 
sites are often repeatedly harvested, increasing the likelihood of  chronic  scarring at those sites. 
As such, methods to reduce the amount of d nor tissue needed to achieve wound closure are 
always sought.  
4.1. Study Rationale  
StrataGraft skin tissue is an allogeneic tissue -engineered product . StrataGraft skin tissue is under 
development by [CONTACT_363894] , the Sponsor  Company, as an alternative to autografting 
in the closure  of thermal burns containing intact dermal elements.  
Clinical data from adults suggest  that treatment of DPT thermal burns with StrataGraft tissue c an 
result in wound closure while reducing or eliminating the need for autograft. Clinical data have 
also shown that this tissue construct does not transplant but  is replaced by [CONTACT_423] ’s cells as 
the wound heals  (Sponsor  unpublished data ). 
This study i s being conducted in order to provide continued access to StrataGraft skin tissue for 
clinical sites following the closure of enrollment to  the STRATA2016 study. This study will 
collect safety and clinical outcomes in a population of subjects with thermally  induced DPT  
burns that contain intact dermal elements.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with applicable regulation s and guidance related to 
GCP  and in compliance with this protocol.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453299] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453300] common noted 
adverse reaction associated with StrataGraft is pruritus .  
Subjects in this stu dy will undergo surgical excision of the burn area. The risks associated with 
the surgical procedure include pain and bleeding at the surgical site as well as potential 
complications of anesthesia, such as nausea/vomiting, chills, and sore throat. A subset  of 
[ADDRESS_453301] of care (SoC) for subject s with thermal burns and do not present any 
increased risk to the subjects.  
StrataGraft skin tissue is a viable, bilayer , allogeneic human skin substitute composed of a fully 
stratified epi[INVESTIGATOR_363872] a single human donor grown on 
a dermal equivalent comprised of purified Type I animal collagen containing normal human 
fibroblasts from a sec ond donor.  During development of the NIKS keratinocytes, these cells 
were previously exposed to murine feeder cells. These feeder cells were derived from a single 
source, thoroughly tested, and found to be free f detectable adventitious agents.  
 To comply 
with current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) xenotransplantation guidelines,  
 (FDA, 2016 ; 
Bloom, 2000 ) archival blood samples will be collected at baseline and retained in accordance 
with FDA guidelines.  
The benefit of treating burns wi h StrataGraft skin ti ssue is that the viable cells of StrataGraft 
tissue produce and secrete a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides that 
are collectively anticipated to facilitate wound repair and tissue regeneration.  
More detailed information about  the known and expected benefit s, risks, and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AE) can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.3. Summary of Relevant Clinical Studies  
Previous studies in adults with DPT  thermal burns have  demonstrated that StrataGraft skin  tissue 
is generally  safe with salutary clinical outcomes in regard to closure of DPT burns and 
elimination of autograft placement in the majority of subjects.  
The Phase 1b study , “Open -label, Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study 
Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of StrataGraft® Skin Tissue in Promoting the Healing of the 
Deep Partial -Thickness Component of Complex Skin Defects as an Alternative to Autografting,” 
(STRATA2011) was an open -label, dose -escalation, multicenter study eval uating the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue in promoting the healing of complex skin 
defects containing intact dermal elements. In this study , StrataGraft skin tissue was applied once 
to DPT burns to assess autologous tissue re generation with reduction or elimination  of MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453302] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

2 comparable burn wound areas identified, excised to remove nonviable tissue, and randomized 
to receive StrataGraft s kin tissue or autograft. Thirty subjects were enrolled with 10 subjects in 
Cohort 1 receiving up to 220 cm2 of refrigerated StrataGraft skin tissue and 10 subjects in Cohort 
2 receiving up to 440 cm2 of refrigerated StrataGraft skin tissue. Ten s ubjects in  Cohort 3 
received up to 440 cm2 of thawed cryopreserved StrataGraft skin tissue . None  of the subjects 
treated with StrataGraft skin tissue exhibited any significant safety concerns and none underwent 
autografting prior to Day 28. Additionally, 27 of the 2 8 per -protocol subjects  (96%)  exhibited 
complete wound closure of StrataGraft treatment sites at Month 3 . Molecular analysis of  biopsies 
taken from treated wound sites at Month 3  demonstrated  no evidence of StrataGraft skin tissue  
DNA , indicating that the cellular components of StrataGraft skin tissue were no longer present . 
The Phase  3 study “A Multicenter, Open -Label, Randomized Comparison of the Efficacy and 
Safety of StrataGraft Skin Tissue vs Autograft in Adult Subjects with Thermal Burns” 
(STRATA2016)  is an open -label, controlled, randomized, multicenter study evaluating the

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a P hase 3b, open -label, multicenter study of adults evaluating the safety and clinical 
outcomes of Strata Graft® skin tissue in the treatment of thermally induced DPT  burns that 
contain intact dermal elem ents. 
No randomization will be conducted for the study, as this study is designed to be a single arm 
study.  
Subjects may be assessed to have no more than 3 noncontiguous burn areas treated and receive 
no more than 20 tissues of StrataGraft skin tissue  (for a total StrataGraft skin tissue treated area 
of no more than approximately 2000 cm2).  
The primary endpoint  is count and percent  of subjects with TEAEs . 
Other endpoints include :  
• The propor tion of StrataGraft skin tissue -treated wound area with confi rmed  wound 
closure without autograft placement (ie, complete re -epi[INVESTIGATOR_363874] ) on or before 
Week  12 and supported by [CONTACT_363885] -documentation . 
• The p roportion of subjects with confirmed  wound closure without autograft 
placement (verified with confirmation assessment) at each visit  and supported by [CONTACT_363885] -
documentation . 
• The proportion of subjects without autografting achieving and maintaining durable 
wound closure by [CONTACT_10585]  24. Durable wound  closure is achieved when a wound is 
observed as remaining closed at l ast 3 months after complete wound closure.  
• The time to confirmed  wound closure without autograft placement (verified with 
confirmation assessment). For in -person visits, the investigat or will assess the wound 
in person or alternatively assess a photo provided by [CONTACT_363896] 
a visit. For the weeks in -between onsite visits, the subject will have a photo taken and 
send them to a photo repository beginning at discharge  then weekly until Week 12 
and then every other week  until Week 24. These photos will also be assessed by [CONTACT_363897].  
• Skin quality and cosmesis  assessments at Week 12 and Week 24 by [CONTACT_70579] t and 
observer using POSAS  scores ; these assessments will be  supported both by 
[CONTACT_363885] -documentation  and POSAS  scores . 
• Number (%) of subjects with wound -infection related events .

8.1. Description of Study Treatment  
The study t reatment is described in Table 3.  
Table 3: Investigational Produc t 
Product Name:  [CONTACT_363920] /Physical Description : StrataGraft skin tissue is an off -white rectangular 
sheet of approximately 100 cm2 (approximately 
8 cm by 12.5 cm), consisting of a viable, 
bioengineered, regenerative skin construct 
derived from human keratinocytes grown on 
gelled collagen co ntaining human dermal 
fibroblas s. StrataGraft skin tissue is stored at  
-70°C to -90°C until thawed for use. The hold 
solution that must be used with the StrataGraft 
skin tissue must be stored at 2° to 8°C until 
required for  surgery.  
Dosage  One application of sheets of no more than [ADDRESS_453321] been surgically excised to 
remove nonviable tissue. It is meshed up to 1:1, 
placed onto the wound bed, trimmed to fit the 
wound as necessary, and secured in place.  
Manufacturer  Stratat ech, a Mallinckrodt Company  
 
8.2. Concomitant Medications  
All concomitant medications, including the use of antibiotics, must be recorded in the eCRF after 
the consent form is signed and throughout the study period. Systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_90413]/antimicrobials may be used at the discretion of the clinical investigator with the 
exception of sulfa mylon  and silver -containing antimicrobials and silver -containing dressings. 
The use of sulfa mylon  and silver containing/releasing antimicrobial s and dressings is not 
recommend ed as they are thought to interfere with the viability of the living cells in StrataGraft 
skin tissue. Prior to StrataGraft skin tissue placement, chlorhexidine can be applied to burn sites 
for wound preparation but must be thoroughly rinsed off prior to StrataGraft placement. After MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453322] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453323] nous fluids generally used to 
maintain hydration and general anesthetic given during surgery need not be captured as 
concomitant medication s.  
8.3. Concomitant Procedures  
Any concomitant procedure (including transfusions, use of xenogenic or allogen eic products , 
negative pressure wound therapy, etc.) must be recorded in the eCRF after the consent form is 
signed and throughout the duration of the study.  
8.4. Randomization and Blinding  
This study is designed as an open -label, single arm study  in whi h all subjects rec eive 
StrataGraft skin tissue and all other burn wounds will be treat d per institutional S oC. No 
randomization will be conducted , and no blinding is required for the study.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453324] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

Wound closure  
Complete wound closure is defined as 100% skin re -epi[INVESTIGATOR_363879] . 
Successful wound closure in this study requires that complete wound closure is achieved without 
autograft  placement  and is confirmed at least 2 weeks following the initial obs ervation of 
complete closure.  The clinical investigator will evaluate treatment site (s), assess the proportion  
of the treated wound closed , complete wound closure , and confirmation of complete wound 
closure either by [CONTACT_363903]-provided photo -documentation  per 
Schedule of Assessment s (Section  6.1.1 ).  
Photo -documentation  
Photographs will be taken by [CONTACT_363904][INVESTIGATOR_118854],  complete wound closure, confirmed wound closure, durable wound closure and 
the POSAS assessments ( eg, appearance and cosmesis) of the treatment sites. Photographs taken 
and submitted by [CONTACT_19578] (or other person designated by [CONTACT_423])  may be used for 
evidence of wound characteristics if a visit is missed or for a  unscheduled  visit. 
Photo-documentation is submitted by [CONTACT_363905] 
[ADDRESS_453329]’s wound is noted to be closed 
for the first time via a submitted ph oto, that photo should trigger the scheduling of a visit 2

A subset of 10 subjects with closed wounds ( from subjects who have  achieved  wound closure, 
across all the  clinical sites) will be separately consented to have a punch biopsy (measuring 3 
mm) taken from the center of the healed burn wound, and another punch biopsy measuring [ADDRESS_453332] and/or taken by [CONTACT_363908].   MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453333] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453334] signing consent to participate in the study and 
include s: TEAE s, treatment -emergent SAE s, local wound infection s, systemic infections, vital 
signs , and deaths  throughout the study duration.  In addition to the collection of common clinical 
study safety data, blood samples (blood plasma and leucocytes) will be collected to comply with 
the archival xenotransp lantation FDA requirements.  
12.1. Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary objective of this study is to d emonstrate the safety of a single application of 
StrataGraft skin tissue in the post excision treatment of thermally induced DPT  burns that 
contain intact dermal  elements. The primary safety endpoint is the count and percentage of 
subjects with TEAEs.  
 
Primary Outcome Measure : 
Title:  
Number of subjects with TEAEs  
 
Description:  
Total count of participants observed with TEAEs during the study  
 
Timeframe:  
Approximately 24 weeks  
 
12.2. Safety Parameters Specific to Therapeutic Category  
12.2.1.  Incidence of infection  
Local wound infection will be determined by [CONTACT_363909]. S imilarly, s ystemic infection will be determined by [CONTACT_363910] , 
fever (defined as >38.5oC) and/or elevated white blood cell count.  
Study treatment  sites will be examined by [CONTACT_363911]. Cultures of the treatment sites may be obtained for microbiological evaluation 
at the discretion of the clinical investigator or per institutional S oC at any time during treatment. 
The clinical investigator will evaluate the wound culture results for clinical significance. 
Infections and their treatment must be documented in the eCRF  with notation of 
StrataGraft -treated site or “ Other” ( ie, SoC treatment) . MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453335] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

In accordance w ith current xenotransplantation  FDA Guidance , an archival blood sample will be 
collected at Day 1 (Baseline ) prior to StrataGraft skin tissue placement and retained.  For further 
detail, see Manual of Procedures , Subject Plasma and Leukocyte Archival . 
12.2.3.  Immunology  
Blood collection for PRA testing (HLA I and II) will be conducted at Day 1 (Baseline), Week 4, 
and Week 12.  
12.2.4.  Regrafting and Delayed Wound Healing  
In the event that a StrataGraft -treated area needs to be regrafted with either an autograft or a 
xenograft after prior treatment with StrataGraft skin tissue, the event would not be marked as an 
AE, but rather as a failure  to close . In the event that there is an accompanying wound 
degradation event occurring simultaneously such as infectio  that results in delayed wound 
healing, the delayed wound healing secondary to the ongoing inf ction can be listed as an AE or 
SAE as applicable. If that infective process eventually w rrants regrafting, the regrafting should 
still be marked as a failure to close and no t an AE.  
12.3. Standard Safety Parameters  
12.3.1.  Demographic/ Social/ Medical History  
Past medical history , social,  and acute medical history will be collected at Screening.  Medical 
history will be reviewed for eligibility for enrollment into the study as described in th e inclusion 
criteria.  
12.3.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, p lse  rate, temperature) will be measur ed at each scheduled study 
time point.  The change from baseline will be calculated for each study time  point  for clinical 
safety analyses . 
12.3.3.  Weight and Height  
Weight and height will be measured at Screening .  
12.3.4.  Physical Examination  
The limited Physical Examination will be conducted at Screening to include evaluation of lungs, 
heart, abdomen, and extremities. The findings of the physical examination will be recorded on 
the eCRF.  
12.3.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory safety parameters will be evaluated for clinically significant changes within this 
subjec t population at Baseline , defined study intervals , and as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_363912] S oC in the evaluation of  study subjects .  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453336] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered casually related to the produc t. In clinical studies, an AE can include 
an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including Baseline or washout periods, 
even if no study treatment has been administered.  
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the consent form  and the AEs occurring during 
treatment  must be recorded on forms provided by  [CONTACT_1034] , whether or not they are related to 
the study.  
Definition of SAE  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any part of the study period  (ie, Baseline, treatment, washout, 
or follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfil ls 
one or more of the following:  
• Results in death ; all AEs with an outcome of death must be reported as SAEs. The 
Investigator should make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and 
autopsy reports to the Sponsor or designee, or state “not available.”  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• It results in persistent or significant d isability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453337] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 40  • It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
12.5. Intensity of Adverse Event  
Intens ity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activiti es) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
of an AE, whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  12.4. An AE of severe 
intensity may not always be considered an SAE . 
12.6. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is licensed to practice medicine must make the determination of relationship 
to the investigational product for each AE ( unrelated, possibly related or probably related ). The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason 
exists fo r suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then  the AE should be 
considered “related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” , the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of exped ited regulatory reporting.  
12.7. Other Adverse Event  
The Drug Safety Physician and  if applicable, the Clinical Study Team Physician will identify 
other adverse event(s) during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report.  
Significant adverse eve nts of particular clinical importance  will be collected as adverse events of 
special interest , ie, events other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of the 
subject from the study ). For each adverse event of special interest , a narrative may b e written and 
included in the clinical study report.  
12.8. Pregnancy Events  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sponsor ’s pregnancy form.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_174509] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or 
congenital abnormality /birth defects ) must be recorded on the eCRF , even if the subject  is 
discontinued from the study.  Elective abortions without complications are not considered  an AE  
and are not reported as an AE.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453338] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.0

 41  All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects , spontaneous miscarriages , and serious 
complica tions due to pregnancy  should be reported  as SAEs .  
In this study, subjects will not be discontinued from the study unless the subject elects to 
withdraw consent.  
12.9. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_363913]/or in respo nse to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
rate need not be reported as AEs.  Howe ver, abnormal values that constitute an SAE , are 
associated with an SAE,  or lead to discontinuation of administration of study treatment  must be 
reported and recorded as an AE.  Information about AEs will be collected from the signing of 
consent form until the end of the study.  All SAE information will be collected from the signing 
of consent form  and throughout the study follow -up period . The AE term s should be reported in 
standard medical terminology when possible.  For each AE  the i vestigator will evalua te and 
report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, 
serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study . 
12.10.  Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unre lated) will be recorded from the signing of consent form until 
following the end of treatment exposure.  All SAEs must be reported to Sponsor  within [ADDRESS_453339] complete, sign and date 
the SAE pa ges, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the 
corresponding source documents, and s nd a copy by [CONTACT_363914] .  
Additional follow -up information  if required or available, should all be faxed to the Sponsor 
within 1 business day of receipt and this should be completed on a follow -up SAE form and 
placed with the original SAE inf rmation and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF  
and/or study file.  
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events.  It is 
the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB or Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her site.  Investigators will also be notified of all 
unexpected, serious, treatment -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the 
clinical study . Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of all SAEs.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453340] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453341] dermal elements.  This study will enroll 
approximately 100 subjects from up to 18 clini cal study centers  that previously participated in

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative of the Sponsor 
will visit the investigational study site to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives.  This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor and the 
investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or representative will have regular contacts with 
the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the  eCRFs , and that investigational product accountability checks 
are being performed  
• Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRF s 
with the subject ’s medical records t the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records relevant to 
the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject  (eg, 
medical records ). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forward d to the Sponsor and those SAEs  that met criteria for reporting 
have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor , a regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the 
site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of a  
Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related 
activities and documents to d etermine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the  
International Council for Harmoni sation, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigat or should contact [CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency about 
an inspection.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453350] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453351] be maintained by [CONTACT_7213].  
Additionally, a n independent  adhoc  Safety Committee will ensure ad equate protection of the 
safety of subjects. The Committee’s  objectives, composition, and operational details of its 
activities will be defined in the Safety Committee  Charter.  
In the event that an SAE occurs  such that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_363883] , the local IRB will be 
notified as presented in the Manual of Procedures.  MNK01053115  Protocol Amendment-1-[ADDRESS_453352] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453353] 2020- | VV-TMF-110806 | 1.[ADDRESS_453354] of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that are consistent with ICH 
GCP, which has its ethical foundation in the Decl ration of Helsinki and  are consistent with 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
16.3. Written Informed Consent  
The Principal Investigator(s) at each study site will ensure that the subject  is given full and 
adequate oral and written information bout the nature, purpose, possible risk , and benefit of the 
study.  Subject s must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  
The subject  should be give  the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the 
information provided.  
The subject ’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures.  
The Principal Investigator(s) must maintain th e original, signed Informed Consent Form.  A copy 
of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject .

surgery  (James Melissa, Lehman et al. 2008) . Analysis of two pr ospective randomized trials that 
included 2644 women, selected based on tumor size less than five cm, negative pathological 
margin of excision and negative lymph nodes. No difference in clinical outcome was detected . 
The conclusion of the review is that th e use of unconventional fractionation regimens ( greater 
than 2 Gy per fraction) does not affect breast appearance or toxicity , and does not seem to affect 
local recurrence or five years survival rates.

 Hypofractionation regimens enable shortening of the duration of therapy; the findings are quite 
relevant, since changing the standard recommendation of [ADDRESS_358327] and level III/SCV nodes in the prone position for women

Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_165978] -fractionated Canadian trial  (Whelan, MacKenzie et al. 2002)  we developed 
a technique  that utilizes IMRT to deliver accelerated prone whole breast radiotherapy with a 
concomitant boost to the tumor bed. The rationale for adding a boost to the tumor cavity derived 
from the results of a prospective randomized trial condu cted by [CONTACT_51222] (Bartelink, Horiot 
et al. 2001) . A recent update of the trial demonstrated a 10 -year cumulative incidence of local 
recurrence of 10.2% versus 6.2% for the no boost and the boost group respectively 
(p < 0.0001)  (Bartelink, Horiot et al. 2007) . 
 
Patients with  stage I or II breast cancer, excised by [CONTACT_294292], and either sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection were eligible for study NYU [ADDRESS_358329] 2004, the planned accrual was completed, with 90 patients 
treated in the protocol (mean follow -up of 39 months, range 1 - 72 months). Median age was 58 
years old (range 28 – 80 yo). Median tumor size was 13 mm (range 1 - 40 mm). Acute toxicity 
was generally mild and is summarized in Table 1 (RTOG score). Most common toxicity was 
radiation dermatitis, which tended to occur the week after completion of treatment.

Longer follow up is required to assess local control, late toxicity, and to determine cosmetic 
results. Because of blood collection, once sufficient time has elapsed to measure late effects, the 
study will enable us to explore associations between specific  genomic profiles and the

 occurrence of fibrosis  (Formenti 2005) . In addition, t his trial generated preliminary data on dose 
sparing to the heart and lung when patients are treated prone (Darby, McGale et al. 2005) . 
 
2.3 Rationale for Prone Radiotherapy: NYU [ADDRESS_358330] approach was used, the 
same regimen originally pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested for prone IMRT. NYU Protocol 05 -181, “Accelerated 
Intensity Modulated  Radiation Therapy (AIMRT) to the Breast after Segmental Ma stectomy: 
Identification of Optimal Individual Positioning ” was opened in [ADDRESS_358331] chemotherapy (if 
indicated), no history of prior or concurrent malignancy (within 3 years), and no history of 
active connective tissue disorders. Patients underwe nt CT simulation in both the prone and 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] s. Treatment followed in the optimal position that ensured the smallest volume of 
heart and lung respectively, in the target field.   
 
From 2006 to 2009  the study met the planned accrual of 400 patients: [ADDRESS_358332] cancer  patients, 
the prone position was optimal in sparing lung volume in 98% (195/200), reducing the volume 
of lung in the treatment field by a mean 107 cc (SD 75, range 463,0). In the five patients treated 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the choice for supi[INVESTIGATOR_294271]’s preference since there was no 
significant difference in lung sparing between the two po sitions. For left breast cancer  patients, 
the prone position was optimal in 85% (170/200), with lung volume reduced by a mean of 93 cc 
(SD 72, range 334, 9) and heart volume reduced by a mean of 11 cc (SD 23, range 0,220).  
However, in 15% of left breast p atients, the best position was supi[INVESTIGATOR_294272] a mean of 6 cc (SD 8, range 0,41).

 reveals that it exceeds the following n ormal tissue dose constraints:

axillary dissection specimen from level I and II) i t is possible to identify patients with [ADDRESS_358335] /chest wall and the draining 
nodal stations that the surgeon did not include in the traditional level I  - II axillary dissection , 
i.e., level III and supraclavicular stations . We ar e proposing to test a new technique that 
extend s prone set up to also include these lymph node regions.  
 
Limiting treatment to the supraclavicular fossa and level III axilla in patients with an adequately 
dissected axilla is supported by [CONTACT_294294]. Regional nodal recurrences are rare 
(occurring in 1  - 5%) in patients with early stage invasive breast cancer who have undergone 
breast conserving therapy (Fisher, Anderson et al. 2002; Moran and Haffty 2002; Harris, Hwang 
et al. 2003) . Several  institutions choose to treat only the level III  axilla and supraclavicular 
nodal stations in patients who have undergone surgical treatment of level I/II axilla. This 
technique was documented recently by [CONTACT_294295], who utilized CT -delineated nodal 
stations to improve target coverage of SCV and le vel III axillary nodes (Liengsawangwong, Yu 
et al. 2007)  in patients who had undergone axillary level I/II dissection and were found  to have 
positive lymph nodes.  
 
Locoregional recurrences have been extensively studied in post -mastectomy patients as well. 
After chest wall recurrences, nodal failures in the undissected axillary level III or 
supraclavicular fossa are the second most comm on type of regional recurrence and occur more 
commonly in patients with four or more positive lymph nodes (Table 3)  (Taghian, Jeong et al. 
2004) . 
 
Table [ADDRESS_358336] -mastectomy Patients without R adiotherapy  
NYU 09-0623  Version 03/23 /2017  
 
Protocol Type / Version # / Version Date  Version 5.4 06/30/[ADDRESS_358337]-mastectomy patients is controversial . 
Some studies report  higher risk of distant recurrence , but no change in locore gional recurrence 
(Donegan, Stine et al. 1993)  while  other s document higher rates of locoregional recurrence in 
patients with extracapsular extension (Garg, Strom et al. 2004; Huang, Tucker et al. 2005) . 
 
There may be a subset of high -risk patients who  would benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy to 
the entire previously -dissected axilla. For example, an axillary boost to treat levels I/II 
decreased nodal recurrence, although it d id not affect overall survival in a cohort of breast 
cancer patients with ten or more positive lymph nodes treated with breast conservation 
therapy  (Chang, Feigenberg et al. 2007) . 
 
In summary, for some patients, the toxicity of any nodal radiotherapy will outweigh the benefit, 
while  other patients have superior outcomes when the entire axilla and supraclavicular fossa are 
treated. There is likely a subset of breast cancer patients who c ould benefit from the advantage 
of limiting nodal radiotherapy to axillary level III and supraclavicular nodes after adequate 
axillary level I/II lymph node dissection , without impairing their chances of loco -regional 
control . Based on the previously refer enced studies, we propose utilizing an approach of limited 
nodal treatment in patients with invasive breast cancer treated by [CONTACT_294296] f ive involved lymph nodes after adequate dissection of level I/II axilla. 
These patients could also be studied to explore the feasibility and safety of an accelerated 
regimen of [ADDRESS_358338] (or chest wall), and level III and supraclavicular nodes . 
 
2.[ADDRESS_358339] it has generally been dis couraged because of concerns regarding 
the morbidity of larger doses to normal tissue, including lymphedema and brachial plexus 
NYU 09-0623  Version 03/23 /2017  
 
Protocol Type / Version # / Version Date  Version 5.4 06/30/[ADDRESS_358340] of the 
ipsilateral brachial plexus, warranting cautious radiobiological modeling of late effects of 
radiotherapy to this target.  
 
The severity of late effects is known to be dependent on both total dose and fraction size. In the 
linear -quadratic model, sensitivity to fraction size is expressed by [CONTACT_193393]/beta ratio, with a 
lower ratio indicating increased sensitivity. In a recent review, Kurtz summarized known 
alpha/beta values for tissues irradiated in breast cance r treatme nt (Table 4) (Kurtz 2005) . 
NYU 09-0623  Version 03/23 /2017

Table 4 - A Review of Results Summarized by [CONTACT_294297].  
 
 
Due to low alpha/beta ratios for most of these tissues, it is possible that higher rates of late 
complications could be observed with an accelerated regimen. To clinically evaluate the impact 
of hypofraction ation  on brachial plexus injury, Powell et al. reported their experienc e with an 
accelerated schedule in a seminal paper published in 1990, describing the late effects of  a group 
of [ADDRESS_358341] and regional lymph nodes with mean brachial plexus 
dose 45.9  Gy in 15 fractions  (3 Gy per fraction)  versus 54 Gy in 30 fractions  (1.8 Gy per 
fraction) (Powell, Cooke et al. 1990) . He noted a cumulative actuarial incidence of radiation -
induced brachial plexus injury at 5.5 years of 5.9% versus 1.0% for the large and small fraction 
size group, respectively. It is important to note that the dos e was higher than our proposed dose 
of 40.[ADDRESS_358342] + SCV, and breast + SCV + axillary boost, lymphedema occurred in 16%, 23%, and 
31%, respecti vely (Hayes, Freedman et al. 2008) . In a large phase III randomized trial, 46% of 
mastectomy patients experienced arm swelling at some point after radiotherapy  (Deutsch, Land 
et al. 2008) . For radical mastectomy patients, total mastectomy and radiotherapy patients, and 
total mastectomy patients in this trial, arm edema wa s recorded at least once in 58.1%, 38.2%, 
and 39.1% of patients, respectively (p  < 0.001) and at last recorded measurement in 30.7%, 
14.8%, and 15.5%, respectively (p  ≤ 0.001). We  anticipate that reduction of the size of the field 
for nodal radiation will reduce rates of lymphedema despi[INVESTIGATOR_294275].  
 
Most patients experience lymphedema within the first year s after treatment, but it can continue 
to increase in severity for more than five years after treatment in over 50% of patients (Bar Ad, 
Cheville et al. 2009) . Therefore, subjects will need to be carefully followed for progressive 
lymphedema , for at least five  years after radiotherapy is complet ed.

The linear -quadratic model (Lea 1942)  can be used to determine whether the proposed IMRT 
protocol should result in a roughly equal probability of tumor control compared with a standard 
schedule, but without increasing the potential for normal tissue damage. The equation 
describing the single dose survival curve (Douglas and Fowler 1 976) using this model is  
 
-lnS = (D + D2) 
 
where S is the surviving fraction, D is the total dose and  and  are tissue specific parameters. 
If the total radiation dose is delivered in a series of n fractions of dose d, rather than a single 
exposure, then the surviving fraction can be described as  
 
-lnS = n(d + d2) 
 
which can be called the biological effect E . This equation can be rewritten as  
 
E = (nd)(+d) = ()(nd)(1+d/ /) 
 
If this equation is divided through by , then E/ = (nd)(1+d/ /). The quantity E/  has been 
termed the biologically effective dose (15) or BED that is similar to the previously sugg ested 
extrapolated response dose (Barendsen 1982) .  
 
Hence,  
BED = (nd)(1+d/ /) 
 
This equation was used to calculate the BEDs for early and late responses, and tumor control for 
a standard schedule representing twenty -three [ADDRESS_358344] during the 24 -hour or greater interval between fracti ons. Table 5 
lists the BEDs for tumor control in addition to the early responses, erythema and desquamation, 
as well as the late responses, telangiectasia and fibrosis. The / values used for these 
computations were reported in previous studies (Steel, Deacon et al. 1987; Matthews, Meeker et 
al. 1989; Turesson and Thames 1989; Thames, Bentzen et al. 1990; Archambeau, Pezner et al.

In terms of normal tissue responses, it can be observed from Table [ADDRESS_358345] treatment plan, is either a reduced probability 
of tumor control or an inc reased risk for late complications. This is due to the observation that 
fractionation generally results in greater sparing of late responding tissues compared with 
tumors. This finding is reflected in the relatively large / values derived for tumors and small 
/ values for late responses (Thames and Hendry 1987) . 
 
In contrast to this generalization, evidence exists that breast cancer cells d isplay a relatively low 
/. This comes from in vitro studies in which / values determined for breast cancer cell 
lines were generally about 4 Gy (Steel, Deacon et al. 1987; Matthews, Meeker et al. 1989; 
Yamada, Ackerman et al. 1999) . The way in which this problem is diminished for this study is 
NYU 09-0623  Version 03/23 /2017  
 
Protocol Type / Version # / Version Date  Version 5.4 06/30/[ADDRESS_358346] and level III and 
supraclavicular will receive 2.7 Gy per fraction.  
 
An even lower / of 2 Gy can be calculated using the results of a prospective randomized tri al 
(Baillet, Housset et al. 1990)  in which a standard treatment of twenty -five 1.8 Gy fractions 
resulted in approximately the same level of tumor recurrence as a hypo -fractionated protocol of 
two 4.5 Gy plus two 6.5 Gy fractions. Therefore, if it is assumed that the BEDs for the two 
treatments were roughly equal, this yie lds an / value of 2 Gy. Although there is evidence in 
the papers cited to support the use of these relatively low / values for BED calculations, 
tumors on average exhibit greater / values in the range of 10 Gy (Williams, Denekamp et al. 
1985; Thames and Hendry 1987) .  
 
Viewing the results of the BED calculations for tumor control presented in Table 5, if the / 
values are assumed to be in the range of 4 - 10 Gy, then there would appear to be only a small 
loss in BED for the AIMRT treatment, while for the 2 Gy / value, the BED val ue for the 
alternate treatment actually is greater than the standard. In addition, it should be noted that the 
hypo -fractionated treatment also represents an accelerated protocol in which the total dose is 
delivered in only [ADDRESS_358347] thereby [CONTACT_294298].  
 
In order to take into account tumor proliferation for the BED calculation, it can be estimated 
that the number of clonogenic cells in the tumor (N) is related to the initial number of clonogens 
(N0) by [CONTACT_294299](N/N 0 ) = (T-Tk) 
 
where  is a constant related to the potential doubling time T pot of the tumor by [CONTACT_294300], 
 = ln2/T pot, T is the total treatment time, and T k (the "kick -off" time) is the time at which 
accelerated repopulation begins (15,26) (Travis and Tucker 1987; Fowler 1989) . Note, this 
relationship is only valid for values of T greater than T k. Therefore,  
 
ln(N/N 0 ) = (ln2/T pot )(T-Tk) 
 
Hence, the biological effect for a fractionated treatment should be decreased  to take into 
account the increase in the number of cells due to repopulation and becomes:  
 
E = n (d+d2) - (ln2/T pot )(T-Tk) 
 
If this equation is divided through by , then the BED equation results and is given by  
 
E/ = [(nd) (1 + d/ /)] – [ln2(T -Tk)/(Tpot)]

 Hence, it is necessary to determine values for , the initial slope of the cell survival curve, as 
well as for T pot and Tk. However, this may be either difficult or impossible to accomplish. 
Therefore, estimates are often made for these values in order to calculate the BED. For the 
purpose of these calculations, values of 0.3 for , (Steel, Deacon et al. 1987; Matthews, Meeker 
et al. 1989)  13 days for T pot (Stanton, Cooke et al. 1996; Haustermans, Fowler et al. 1998)  and 
[ADDRESS_358348] treatment for / values of either 2 or 4 Gy and is only 
slightly lower when a 10 Gy / value is used. In addition, it must be kept in min d that there is 
a range of T pot values for a population of tumors. Therefore, the accelerated nature of the 
AIMRT treatment may have a particularly beneficial effect for those patients whose tumors are 
characterized by [CONTACT_294301] T pot values.  
 
Of co urse, if cell proliferation is taken into account, this also diminishes the BEDs and lessens 
the severity of the anticipated early responses for the standard schedule compared with the 
AIMRT schedule. This should not affect late responses because the T k is generally greater than 
the total treatment time for late responding tissues as compensatory proliferation usually does 
not begin until after completion of a standard protocol. However, even if the BEDs were 
decreased to take into account cell proliferatio n, this would probably result in only slightly 
diminished BEDs for erythema and desquamation for the standard schedule, resulting in BEDs 
comparable to the AIMRT schedule.  
 
2.6.[ADDRESS_358349], by [CONTACT_294302] I  and II axillary lymph nodes in a previously dissected axilla, we anticipate 
reduced risk of lymphedema.  Additionally, treatment in the prone position has been shown to 
reduce dose to heart and lungs (Formenti, Gidea -Addeo et al. 2007) , which  may decrease late 
toxicity to these organs. Finally, while standard 3 -field and 4 -field techniques provide 
inadequate lymph node coverage in the  prone position (refer to preliminary data in Section 
2.6.2), use of IMRT technique will enable prone target coverage while maintaining low doses to 
normal tissues.

prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_294276]. Supraclavicular and level III axillary lymph 
node regions, breast tissue, tumor bed, heart, and ipsilateral lung were manually contoured. Six 
treatment pla ns were created for each patient; all utilized tangential fields to target breast tissue. 
A three -dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) plan with a single anterior -oblique field, 
a 3DCRT plan with anterior -oblique and posterior axillary boost fields, and an intensity -
modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plan were utilized to target regional nodes in both prone and 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_105523]. Dose -volume histograms were compared to evaluate lymph node coverage and 
normal tissue dose. Two -tailed student t -test was used t o identify statistically significant 
differences between planning techniques. Nodal target and normal tissue doses from the six 
techniques are summarized below in Tables 6 - 8.

2.7 Quality of Life Assessment  
 
Quality of life (QOL) assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_294303] (i.e., 
baseline, last week of treatment, 45 - 60 days from starting radiotherapy a nd 2-year follow -up). 
Patients status post mastectomy will be asked to answer applicable questions only in the QOL 
assessment. This trial will use the QLB and QLF questionnaires from the RTOG.  
 
The QLB and QLF questionnaires are derived from a validated integration of parts of the 
BCTOS and MOS SF 36.  BCTOS is a validated questionnaire that measures cosmetic results 
based on  patient self -reports.  This brief self -report instrument has high reliability and validity, 
and has been  used in a variety of previous studies on recovery from breast cancer treatment  
(Stanton, Krishnan et al. 2001) . MOS SF36 is a common QOL questionnaire used in cancer 
patients  (Shelbourne 1992; Ware and Sherbourne 1992) . 
 
2.[ADDRESS_358356] and N odal Radiation  
 
Hoeller et al . recently reported a careful comparison of The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 
(RTOG) and Late Effects Normal T issue Task Force subjective, objective, management, and 
analytic (LENT/SOMA) scores for late breast toxicity after radiation in a group of breast cancer 
patients  (Hoeller, Tribius et al. 2003) . In comparison, when LENT/SOMA criteria were used,

 telangie ctasia was downgraded in 45%  of patients . Inter -observer variability was similar for 
both classification systems and ranged from Cohen's kappa 0.3 (retraction) to 0.91 
(telangie ctasia). The au thors concluded that LENT/SOMA criteria seem to be the better tool in 
grading and recording late radiation toxicity as compared to the RTOG scale. Specifically, 
fibrosis scores correlated well with the LENT/SOMA scoring system (Spearman's rho 0.78, p = 
0.01). The LENT/SOMA scoring system will be used in the reporting of late radiation morbidity 
in this protocol .

hypothyroidism. On e recent study documented hypothyroidism in 18% of patients with stage 
II/III invasive breast cancer who had undergone radiotherapy, compared to only 6% (p < 0.001) 
of an age -matched control group from the general population (Reinertsen, Cvancarova et al. 
2009) . 
 
As such, patients will undergo thyroid function testing, including measurement of serum thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T [ADDRESS_358360] been used in previously published studies 
(Keramopoulos, Tsionou et al. 1993; Bar Ad, Cheville et al. 2009) . 
 
 
2.8.[ADDRESS_358361] likely long -term toxicity of accelerated radiation is soft tissue fibrosis and skin 
telangie ctasia the preliminary recognition of genetic predispositions to these co mplications 
enables the exclusion of high -risk carriers from the trials of accelerated/hypo -fractionated 
radiation. In other words, similar to the impact of pharmacogenomics in medical oncology, the 
field of radiation -genomics is also rapi[INVESTIGATOR_165985], per mitting identification of  individual s 
with genetic predisposition to inferior repair of the damage caused by [CONTACT_22256].  
 
A recent study from Quarmby [CONTACT_2297] . has shed some light on the genetic risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_294283] -ionizing radiati on. To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 
of transforming growth factor beta -1 (TGF -beta1) were associated with the susceptibility of

performed P olymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism  (PCR -
RFLP) assays for TGF -beta1 gene polymorphisms on DNA obtained from [ADDRESS_358363] cancer 
patients who  received radiotherapy  (Quarmby, Fakhoury et al. 2003) . The G -800A, C –509T, 
T+869C and G+915C polymorphic sites were examined, and genotype and allele frequencies of 
two subgroups of patients were calculated and compared. The investigators found that the less 
prevalent –509T and +869C alleles were significantly associated with a subgroup of patients 
who developed severe radiation -induced normal tissue fibrosis (n  = 15) when compared with 
those who did not (n  = 88) (odds ratio  = 3.4, p  = 0.0036, and 2.37, p  = 0.035, respectively). 
Furthermore, patients with the –509TT or +869CC g enotypes were between seven and 15 times 
more likely to develop severe fibrosis. These findings imply a role for the -509T and +869C 
alleles in the biological mechanisms underlying susceptibility  to radiation -induced fibrosis.

It is first impo rtant to note that [CONTACT_294318]’s (co -investigator) laboratory has extensive 
experie nce in the detection of genetic alterations using Denaturing High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (DHPLC)  (Atencio, Iannuzzi et al. 2001; Iannuzzi,  Atencio et al. 2002; 
Bernstein, Teraoka et al. 2003) . In addition, our group is part of the WECARE consortium of 
four laboratories that is in the process of using DHPLC to screen [ADDRESS_358366].  
 
For the purpose of this trial bloo d will be collected to enable future genomic analysis for this 
polymorphism to explore association with the incidence of grade 3 and 4 late complications at 3 
years follow up  and for other related research studies . Methods details of DHPLC are covered in

In the context of a Phase I/II prospective study, this protocol will test whole breast and regional 
nodal radiotherapy using a hybrid approach. Patien ts will receive whole breast radiotherapy in a 
prone position with a concomitant daily boost to the tumor bed over three weeks, a technique 
which has previously been evaluated in over 500 patients (NYU 03 -30 and NYU 05 -181) and 
has shown excellent toleranc e and results. In addition, an intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT ) technique will be used to deliver concomitant radiotherapy to axillary level III and 
supraclavicular lymph nodes.  In patient Cohort A, axilliary  levels I and II will also be part of 
the radiation target. Patients status post mastectomy will receive whole reconstructed 
breast/chest wall radiotherapy and nodal irradiation.  A concomitant boost to the scar region will 
be offered only to patients witho ut reconstruction.

8.1 Dose Modification  
 
In case of grade 3 acute skin  toxicity  occurring during the course of the 3 -week treatment , the 
dose per fraction of the remaining treatment frac tions will be reduced to  2 Gy/fraction until 
completion.

undergone mastectomy or breast conserving therapy (Fisher, Anderson et al. 2002; Moran and 
Haffty 2002; Harris, Hwang et al. 2003) . While most nodal recurrences occur within the first 
five years after treatment, nodal recurrences  have been documented for more than twenty years 
after completion of treatment (Lukens, Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_294286]. 2009) .

10.2 Lymphocyte  Isolation, DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification and DNA Sequencing  
 
The lymphocyte isolation and DNA extraction and DHPLC procedures will be performed as 
previously described  (Iannuzzi, Atencio et al. 2002)  using the WaveTM DNA Fragment Analysis 
System manufactured by [CONTACT_294304]. Any samples that appear, based upon the DHPLC 
screening, to be homozygous for either the –509C→T or +869T →C TGF-[ADDRESS_358388] Method  
 
The products of the PCRs will be subjected to DHPLC analysis with the 96 well plate placed in 
the DHPLC apparatus. The WaveTM DNA Fragment Analysis System (Transgenomic), which  
will be used for this project, represents a complete unit  for the automated DHPLC analysis of 
PCR products using a DNASep cartridge specifically designed for separation of DNA 
fragments. DHPLC is a high throughput technique in which large numbers of DNA samples can 
be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_294289].  
 
In this method, a portion of a gene is amplified using standard PCR conditions and the products 
analyzed using DHPLC. Material from a homozygous sample will only form one species, the 
wild-type homoduplex. However, when the PCR products produced from a sam ple

 heterozygous for a base sequence alteration are heated to 95 C, and then slowly cooled, the 
DNA strands separate and randomly reanneal to form a mixture of four  species; a mutant 
homoduplex, two heteroduplexes and a wild type homoduplex. When mutant an d wild -type 
DNA strands reanneal to form a heteroduplex, the molecule is physically altered. At the region 
of base pair mismatches, a "bubble" forms yielding a short linear region of single -stranded 
DNA. This structural alteration provides the basis for se paration of heteroduplex from 
homoduplex species and ultimately identifies samples with mutant alleles. The basis of this 
technique is that by [CONTACT_294305], it is possible to partially denature the 
sample and elute the homoduplexes and heteroduplexes separately. Heteroduplexes, having a 
greater percentage of single -stranded DNA than homoduplexes in the mismatch region at a 
given temperature, will elute first  from the column. Therefore, if the DNA sample does not 
possess a base sequen ce alteration, only homoduplexes will form and there will be only one 
peak on the chromatogram representing the homogenous nature of the fragment. A sample that 
contains a heterozygous mutation will appear as 2, 3 or 4 peaks representing the two 
homoduplex  and heteroduplex populations.  
 
It is also important to note that samples homozygous for a polymorphic allele can readily be 
detected using DHPLC by [CONTACT_1583] a roughly equal amount of DNA to the PCR from a sample 
known to be homozygous for the normal allele , thus essentially creating a potentially 
“heterozygous” sample.

of a sample homozygous for the polymorphic allele.

 10.4 Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography  (DHPLC)  
 
The mutation screening technique to be used in this study will be denaturing high performance 
liquid chromatography or DHPLC  (Huber, Oefner et al. 1993; Huber, Oefner et al. 1993; 
Kuklin, Munson et al. 1997; Oefner and Underhill 1998) . DHPLC is a robust technique that can 
be used to screen any gene in a large population for single nucleotide substituti ons, as well as 
small deletions and insertions. Subjects that are either homozygous or heterozygous for a 
particular allele can both be identified using DHPLC. The advantage of DHPLC is that it 
enables the rapid, sensitive, accurate and inexpensive identif ication of polymorphisms and 
mutations in an automated fashion . Of greatest importance for this project is the evidence that 
DHPLC possesses a sensitivity and specificity for mutation detection approaching 100%  (Liu, 
Smith et al. 1998; O'Donovan, Oefner et al. 1998; Arnold, Gross et al. 1999; Choy, Dabora et al. 
1999; Gross, Arnold e t al. 1999; Jones, Austin et al. 1999; Wagner, Stoppa -Lyonnet et al. 1999; 
Nickerson, Weirich et al. 2000; Taniguchi, Krishnadath et al. 2000)  and that this approach 
possesses greater sensitivity than gel -based assays.  
 
The sensitivity and accuracy of D HPLC for detection of genetic alterations was probably best 
demonstrated by a quality control study  (Bernstein, Teraoka et al. 2003)  performed by [CONTACT_294306] (Women’s Environment, Cancer and Radiation Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]) Study Collaborative 
Group. There are four international laboratory  centers (including the laboratory of [CONTACT_294320], a co -investigator in this project) that are in the process of screening more than [ADDRESS_358390] cancer patients for mutations and polymorphisms in a variety of genes associated with 
DNA repair and radiati on responses. The purpose of this quality control study was to investigate 
the sensitivity and specificity of DHPLC for the detection of ATM  mutations and  
polymorphisms. A panel of 19 DNA samples consisting of 4 unaffected controls, 2 
heterozygous carriers, and 13 ataxia telangiectasia patients was supplied in a blinded fashion to 
each of the four laboratories and screened using DHPLC. Prior screening by [CONTACT_294307]-Strand 
Conformation Polymorphism  (SSCP) and Protein Truncation Test  (PTT) had detected 19 
mutations among these samples; 18 of these were detected by [CONTACT_294308], an efficiency of 95%. In 
addition to these [ADDRESS_358391] of samples.  Any residual blood specimen 
after performing the listed laboratory studies will be destroye d.

14 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
14.1 Endpoints/Objectives:  
 
The primary objectives of this study are to:  
1. To evalua te feasibility of prone IMRT to breast, level  I- III (includes Cohort 
A) and supraclavicular nodes (physics and dosimetry parameters) .  
2. To estimate  acute toxicity of prone IMRT to breast, level I- III (includes 
Cohort A)  and supraclavicular nodes  
 
Secondary objectives are to:  
1. estimate  the incidence of re -simulation to improve dosimetry after initial 
prone set -up 
2. evaluate changes in QOL of  patients assessed at baseline and after treatment  
3. estimate incidence of  late radiation toxicity (e.g., lymph edema, fibrosis and 
telangiectasia) and to examine genetic determinants of breast fibrosis  
 
Exploratory objectives include:  
Estimation of local recurrence rates; estimation of median disease -free survival; 
estimation of median time to progression, and estimation of median overall survival 
time.  
  
 
14.2 Statistical Considerations, Sample S ize and Interim Analysis Plans  
 
14.3 Statistical Analysis  
 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all demographic and disease characteristics of patients 
at baseline using frequency distributions for qualitative variables and summary statistics (e.g. , 
median, mean, etc.) and graphical displays (e.g. , boxplots) for quantitative variables.  
 
14.3.1 Primary En dpoints  
 
The primary outcome of this study is the proportion o f patients with acute toxicity greater than  
grade 2  (Skin  toxicities grade 3 and above)  occurring within [ADDRESS_358397] 95% confi dence interval. Treatment feasibility will be 
evaluated for each patient by [CONTACT_294310] 7.5.6.  The proportion of patients who meet the constraints will be estimated with an 
exact 95% confidence i nterval.

by [CONTACT_294311], week 3 and at the two foll ow up time points. 
Descriptive summary statistics, including median and interquartile range (IQR) will be 
calculated for each item, subscale, and total score, and will be presented at each time point. 
Methods for the analysis of longitudinal data will be u sed to provide an overall evaluation of 
changes in QOL over time. The proportion of patients with late toxicity (including fibrosis and 
telangiectasia) (greater than  grades 2) occurring beyond [ADDRESS_358399] 95% conf idence interval. The cumulative incidence of fibrosis will be 
estimated with 95% confidence interval. The genetic determinants of breast fibrosis will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_294312] –509C→T or +869T →C TGF -1 polymorphism results of the 
genetic screening w ith the cumulative incidence of fibrosis.  
 
14.3.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
 
Additional endpoints under study include: local recurrence -free survival, disease -free survival, 
time to progression, and overall survival. Kaplan Meier time to event curves will be c alculated 
along with estimates of medians and 95% confidence intervals for all these endpoints.  
 
14.4 Accrual estimates  
 
Estimated number of eligible patients for this trial is 4  - 6 patients per month.  Since the recent 
publication of Giuliano AE (JAMA, 2011 Feb 9; 305(6):606 -70), fewer axillary node dissection 
are being performed nationwide. Consequently, it is expected that the accrual to study NYU [ADDRESS_358400] to accrue 104 pati ents over 
5 years.  
 
14.5 Sample Size Considerations/Interim Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint for the estimation of sample size is the proportion of patients with acute 
skin toxicity of  greater than grade  [ADDRESS_358401] day of treatmen t. 
Overall, the regimen will be considered to be unacceptable if more than 5% of patients have 
acute skin toxicity of greater than  grade [ADDRESS_358402]

the proportion of regional nodal recurrences is 5% is  rejected at an interim review.  
Regional nodal recurrence is d efined as recurrence within the axilla, level III or supraclavicular 
nodes, documented b y PET -CT imaging and/or biopsy.  
With 5 interim looks (every [ADDRESS_358409] 1 year), with Pocock

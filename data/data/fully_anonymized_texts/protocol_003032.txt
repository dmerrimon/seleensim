1.1. Background 
1.1.1. PTSD  
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a reaction to a traumatic event in which an 
individual perceives threat of death or significant injury, resulting in acute fear that is 
experienced over an extended period of time following the event(s). According to the Diagnostic and S tatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5), symptoms are 
generally categorized in terms of intrusive symptoms (diagnostic criterion B), avoidance (diagnostic criterion C), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (diagnostic criterion D) , 
and alterations in arousal and reactivity (diagnostic criterion E) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). PTSD will develop in up to a third of individuals who are exposed to a significant stressor  (Committee on Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Dis order, Institute of 
Medicine, 2008), and approximately 10% to 20% of those diagnosed with PTSD will become chronic (Fletcher, Creamer, & Forbes, 2010). According to the 2000 National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), an estimated 6.8% of adults in the [LOCATION_002] will experience PTSD during their lifetime  (Dohrenwend et al., 2006). Certain subgroups (e.g., military service 
members) are at an increased risk because of their higher likelihood of trauma exposure (Jonas et al., 2013) . PTSD prevalence am ong active duty service members ranges from approximately 
5% to 15% (Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008). Hoge and colleagues (2004) reported an estimated 12.9% of service members returning from combat operations in Iraq fit diagnostic criteria for PTSD.  
There also is evidence that the prevalence of PTSD is increasing among service members. 
The 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Service Members (HRB Survey) found that an estimated 11% met screening criteria for further evaluation of PTSD symptoms, up from 7% in 2005 (Bray et al., 2009). There also is a host of related sequelae, and comorbidity with other mental health disorders is high. In particular, work impairment and decreased earnings, divorce, and difficulties with child rearing are common (Kessler, 2000), multiplying the impact of the disorder by [CONTACT_795049]. Finally, PTSD often occurs together with other disorders, including depression and substance use disorders (Brady, Killeen, Brewerton, & Lucerini, 2000) , further compounding the impact. 
1.1.2. PTSD Treatment  
Treatments for PTSD include both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic modalities, with 
little existing systematic evidence for effectiveness. A 2008 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on treatment effectiveness  (2008) included a systematic review of available treatments and 
divided them into pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_795017], with an eye toward reviewing major clinical practice guidelines. At the time of publication, the research regarding the e ffectiveness 
of pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_795018] a determination of a preferred treatment. Similarly, the report found that, for all but one modality (exposure therapy), there was insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of psychotherapeutic treatments. An additional report released by [CONTACT_229334] (AHRQ)  (Jonas et al., 2013), found similar results regarding the effectiveness of exposure 
therapy, but also characterized a handful of pharmacologic modalities as effective, though with significantly smaller effect sizes than exposure therapy. 
Protocol SGB -[ADDRESS_1096732] some significant 
disadvantages. Pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_795019], but not limited 
to, nausea, weight gain, headache, sexual dysfunction, and agitation. Furthermore, these medications may take up to 6 to 8 weeks of regular use before they begin to provide symptom relief  (Alexander, 2012) , during which time it is not uncommon for patients to develop side 
effects, which may result in discontinuation of the medication(s). Psychotherapeutic modalities tend to take an extended period of time to show an effect, frequently 6 to 24 months before the patie nt experiences significant relief  (Sharpless & Barber, 2011). Also, some of the most 
effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795020], if improperly applied, may risk further deterioration of the patient (Rauch, Eftekhari, & Ruzek, 2012).  
Patient adherence to and acceptability of prescribed treatments also impact  treatment 
effectiveness. Health beliefs  (Spoont, Sayer, & Nelson, 2005); knowledge of PTSD and its 
potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Gray, Elhai, & Frueh, 2004); and comorbid substance abuse, depression, 
and other conditions (Kronish, Edmondson, Li, & Cohen, 2012) all play a role in adherence to prescribed treatment regimens. Tarrier and colleagues  (2006) conducted a study assessing the 
acceptability of different psychotherapeutic modalities for PTSD. They found that stigma associated with receiving treatment was a significant concern for study participants. Stigma has been shown to be a deterrent for service members to receive treatment for behavioral health concerns such as PTSD. In 2011, one of the key study researchers (Rae Olmsted et al. , 2011) 
found that while all service members in their study reported stigma regarding treatment for behavioral health issues, those who had actually received behavioral health treatment perceived greater stigma  associated with treatment. These researchers  suggested that such stigma may 
result in higher likelihood of treatment failure or discontinuation ( cf. Fung, Tsang, & Chan, 
2010), and that those who had previously received treatment may share their perceptions with other service members, in turn dissuading those service members from seeking help should they need it. Kim and colleagues  (2011) have reported similar findings. 
1.1.3. Stellate Ganglion Block  
Given these concerns, there is a clear need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795021], effective, 
fast-acting, with few side effects, and with good patient acceptability and adherence. 
Sympathetic blockade, and stellate ganglion block (SGB) in particular, is hypothesized to fill this need. SGB is a procedure routinely performed since the 1920s to treat common conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), hot flashes, Raynaud’s syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and other sympathetically mediated conditions. The stellate ganglion (SG) is a sympathetic ganglion located  at the base of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_795022] C7 transverse process. 
Sensory afferent projections from the heart and thoracic cavity to cervicothoracic dorsal root ganglia traverse the SG  (Oldfield & McLachlan, 1978) ; second -order neurons in the ipsilateral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_795023], and via third-order neurons to the somatosensory cortex (Nozdrachev, Fateev, Jimenez, & Morales, 2003). The neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVN) appear to contact [CONTACT_795050] (SPN) in the intermediolateral column of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]; those neurons project to the SG (Ranson, Motawei, Pyner, & Coote, 1998). Sympathetic postganglionic neurons then project from the SG to the heart and thoracic cavity. Other sympathetic efferents traverse the SG  (Nozdrachev et al., 2003). 
The SG thus is a major sympathetic switching and transit station for the “fight-or-flight” 
response; interrupting this complex circuitry with a local anesthetic could have observable effects on conditions mediated by [CONTACT_795051], such as PTSD.

416632- 2.0_SGB_Bartoszek_v 3 Mar 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27  March 3, 2018  In SGB a local anesthetic is injected into the SG to “block” its function. To date, only a 
small number of case reports and series have been published about the effectiveness of SGB in 
treating PTSD, but the findings are intriguing and warrant further scientific investigation. In 1990, Lebovits and colleagues (1990) described an adolescent female who had suffered  multiple 
gunshot wounds and developed  both reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and PTSD. The 
patient received 13 SGBs (for RSD) over 15 weeks and reported marked PTSD symptom 
improvement, characterized by [CONTACT_795052]. Nearly 20 years later, Lipov et al. (2008) reported a patient with insufficient reduction in PTSD 
symptoms from pharmacotherapy who underwent SGB [ADDRESS_1096733]-trauma. The individual reported immediate resolution of his symptoms (80% to 90% reduction) as well as improved appetite and sleep. The symptoms, however, returned 32 days later, at which time pulsed radiofrequency energy was applied to the SG. Three months later, the patient reported a continued 90% improvement in all symptoms of PTSD. Mulvaney and colleagues (2010), including two  of the co -investigators of the current study (Mulvaney and McLean), described 
two patients diagnosed with PTSD and treated with SGB. In both, post- treatment PTSD 
Checklist (PCL) scores were sub -threshold for PTSD diagnosis. One of the patients requested 
retreatment 3 months later; their symptoms remained diminish ed for an additional 7 months of 
follow up. Hicky et al. (2012) described 9 military service members with chronic PTSD who were treated with SGB. Each of the participants had more than 1 year of unsuccessful treatment via pharmacotherapeutic and/or psychotherapeutic modalities. Following a single SGB, Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) assessments showed that [ADDRESS_1096734] reduction in symptoms experienced full remission after the second procedure.  
Mulvaney et al.  (2014) (including two other authors involved in this trial, Lynch and Kane) 
recently reported a case series  of [ADDRESS_1096735] – Military (PCL -M) was administered a day before treatment and repeated at [ADDRESS_1096736]- SGB.  An improvement in PCL-M scores of ≥10 was observed in 
73.5% of the [ADDRESS_1096737] 3 months  and then had the return of symptoms were treated with a second SGB; their 
PCL-M response trends were similar to those with their first SGB.  
These findings support the need for a randomized, blinded, sham -procedure- controlled trial 
to rigorously study the efficacy of SGB for treatment of PTSD symptoms. 
1.1.4. Theoretical Models  
There are few published theoretical models that seek to explain the effectiveness of SG B 
for PTSD. Lipov and colleagues (2009) proposed that the procedure causes its effect via an interaction between the SG and key brain areas known to modulate PTSD, including the insular cortex  (Liberzon & Martis, 2006) and the amygdala (Rauch et al., 2000). This hypothesis has 
been challenged, however, as being based on faulty understanding of some of the explanatory research cited by [CONTACT_89588]  (Alino, 2011). In another theoretical model, Uchida, Tateda, and 
Hino  (2002) proposed that SGB effects are throu gh the involvement of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_795024] -201 Amendment 2.0 
RTI International  
 
 
416632- 2.0_SGB_Bartoszek_v 3 Mar 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28  March 3, 2018  regulation of melatonin secretion. The authors note that their hypothesized mechanism of action 
is based on foundations of Oriental medicine, as opposed to Western medicine. Nonetheless, the case report and series literature provide support for the evaluation of SGB as a procedure to help ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD.  
1.2. Rationale for the Current Study  
Because SGB is routinely done in the military  for indications such as complex regional 
pain syndrome, and occ asionally  for treatment of PTSD symptoms  (i.e., approximately 25 per 
month at WAMC), there is an unequalled opportunity to collect data and assess the effectiveness and patient acceptability of the procedure for a relatively low cost. Though there is not compelling supporting evidence, currently SGBs are performed as treatment for PTSD at the request and referr al from a behavioral health provider (BHP) or other provider . Efficacy of the 
treatment should be established now, before its use becomes more widespread and “ accepted, ” 
and thus the conduct of a randomized, sham -procedure-controlled study becomes significantly 
less feasible.  
In its original formulation, this study was envisioned to be fully double blinded, with the 
physicians performing the intervention administering 5-7 mL of study drug (either 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_795025]) at the stellate ganglion.  However , in a recently  presented  randomized, 
controlled trial of SGB for treatment of PTSD  (McLay et al., 2015), no differences in CAPS 
scores were observed between subjects who received a 7 mL 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_795026] 7 ml of normal saline superficial to the anterior 
tubercle of C6. The trial was smaller (42 subjects), only one of up to three SGB was placebo controlled and blinded (the first), and selection criteria were broad and included subjects with potential secondary gain. Nevertheless, it failed to meet a lower bar than afforded by a fully 
blinded study design. Given  these data and also the fact  that the injection of 5 -7 mL of saline 
around and/or into the stellate ganglion could itself have significant (though likely brief) functional effects, addressing the question “does application of a long- acting anesthetic at the 
stellate ganglion have a different effect than that of an equal volume of saline on PTSD symptoms assessed by [CONTACT_25905]?” seems to the Investigators a less practical and relevant question to address  than “does interruption of function of the stellate ganglion with a 
standardized approach using a long- acting anesthetic have a different effect than  a nearby [CONTACT_795053] (without any theoreticall y relevant  mechanism of action)  on PTSD symptoms as 
assessed by [CONTACT_25905] ?” Only the physicians administering the intervention and their immediate 
team will be unblinded; all other study personnel and the participants themselves will not be informed of trea tment arm assignment.  
In order for the benefits of SGB and other treatment to be realized, service members must 
be willing to initiate and engage in treatment. Individual understanding of treatment options, mechanisms , and effectiveness is a key determinan t of treatment acceptability  (Sayers et al., 
2009; Shiner et al., 2013).
 However, individuals filter information about treatment options 
through values and beliefs that impact  how information is processed and understood ( Charles, 
Gafni, & Whelan, 1999; Charles et al., 2006).  Extensive evidence supports the premise that 
service members ’ beliefs and values related to mental health treatment are powerfully 
influenced by [CONTACT_795054] (Vogt, 2011).
 Therefore, we have integrated a concurrent qualitative

other treatment options for PTSD.  
Should SGB be demonstrated to be effective, findings from the qualitative study will 
inform communication about the procedure between providers and service members. Our findings will also  contribute to efforts to encourage utilization of other evidence based PTSD

2.1. Clinical Effectiveness Trial  
The primary objective of the effectiveness study is: 
• to evaluate whether right-sided SGB performed at 0 and 2 weeks will improve  the 
CAPS -5 total symptom scores between baseline and 8 weeks  
The secondary objectives of this study are: 
• to evaluate whether right-sided SGB performed at 0 and 2 weeks will improve  PTSD 
symptoms as reflected by [CONTACT_795055] -5 items  between baseline and 8 weeks  
• to explore the association between  the main outcome and  potential confounding 
variables (e.g., concomitant medications, duration of PTSD, post-block Horner’ s 
syndrome, etc.) 
• to eva luate whether right -sided SGB performed at 0 and 2 weeks will reduce  distress 
(K6),  suicidality (M.I.N.I. -Plus Suicidality), anxiety (GAD-7), depression ( PHQ-9), 
alcohol use (AUDIT- C/AUDIT)  or pain ( short pain scale) between baseline and 8 
weeks  
• to evaluate whether right -sided SGB performed at 0 and 2 weeks will improve physical 
and mental (SF -12) condition between baseline and 8 weeks  
2.2. Acceptability Study  
• to assess  perceptions of SGB in relation to other PTSD treatment options among 
service members who have received the procedure and inform communication with 
service members before, during, and after the procedure.

3.1. Clinical Effectiveness Trial  Treatment Plan and  Regimen  
This will be a multisite, randomized, blinded, sham-procedure-controlled study to evaluate 
the efficacy of unilateral right -sided stellate ganglion block (SGB) on the acute symptomatology 
of PTSD, evaluated by [CONTACT_25905] -5 pre -treatment and at 8 wee ks. Participants will be  centrally  
randomized  to 2:1 active:sham SGB and will be evaluated at Womack Army Medical Center in 
North Carolina, Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, and Landstuhl Regional Medical 
Center in [LOCATION_013].  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_795056] a 2:1 
active:sham ratio.  
On the day of the procedure, clinic nursing staff will perform standard nursing intake to 
include brief interim history, review of systems, vital signs, and placement of intravenous catheter. The attending physician will perform a targeted history and physical, paying attention to potential contraindications to SGB (e.g., infection at the site of injection, current anticoagulated state, presence of mass distorting the tissues, recent myocardial infarction, contralateral phrenic nerve palsy, glaucoma). The physician will also give a brief explanation of the procedure as well as a review of risks and potential benefits , though these will have been 
described to the participants beforehand .  
Injections will be performed under ultrasound visualization. The study medication will be 
either 7-10 mL 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_795027] (around and 
into the ventral fascia) and into the longus coli immediately dorsal to the presumed ventral fascia at the level of the C6 anterior tubercle (landm arks for the stellate ganglion ) (active study 
medication) or 1-2 mL preservative free normal saline injected anterolateral to the anterior 
tubercle of C6 ( sham procedure ). The participant will not be informed which treatment he or she 
has received; the interaction of the participant and treating physician will be scripted as much as 
possible. Customary vital signs will be recorded. MEDCOM 40 -54 dated Feb 09 provides “ a 
standard process and procedure for surgical and procedural site verification of patients undergoing operative or other invasive procedures”. In accordance with this regulation, the participant ’s identity, the procedure to be performed, and the specific site of the procedure wi ll 
be verified.  A separate paper Case Report Form (CRF) will be created for the procedure; this 
information will not be shared with anyone outside the treatment suite (Research Coordinator (RC), participant, other members of the RTI project team, etc.).  It is critical that only the 
physician administering the treatment (and his immediate team) be aware of the participant ’s 
assignment to active or sham intervention. Following the intervention, the treating physician 
should have no further contact [CONTACT_795057].  At 
no point in time during the conduct of the trial should the physician or treatment team disclose by [CONTACT_302893]-verbal communication the intervention received by [CONTACT_2299].  Once an 
individual participant completes their participation in the trial, they may be offe red an unblinded 
standard SGB as clinically indicated , but they will remain blinded to their treatment arm.  After 
an individual participant completes their portion of the study (i.e., after completion of the Week 
8 instruments and their second CAPS-5), if an independent clinician providing care to the participant needs to know the intervention assignment of that particular participant in order to 
make clinical treatment decisions, a request may be made to the study PI ([CONTACT_103827]) for unblinding. [CONTACT_795117] (blinded) will evaluate the request and, if granted, will notify an 
unblinded RTI colleague to provide the intervention information to th e clinician for use in

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32  March 3, 2018  clinical decision -making; the clinician, however, is not to disclose the participant ’s intervention 
information to anyone else.  
Immediately following the procedure, the participant will be observed in the procedure 
suite prior to tr ansport to the recovery area for assessment of potential complications that could 
require immediate intervention,  according to local clinic policy. They then will be taken to the 
post-procedure recovery area, where monitoring of vital signs will continue under the 
supervision of the recovery nurse for 20 minutes or longer, as dictated by [CONTACT_795058]. T he study RC will use metrics to assess for a Horner’s syndrome (
Section 
6.3). A successful block will be recognized by [CONTACT_795059] (although 
we are unaware of data pertaining to possible signs and symptoms from saline injection near the SG). The RC will not share outcome information with the physician or the participant. While  we 
cannot completely prevent the possibility of inadvertent un-blinding of study participants who may be familiar with the significance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_795028], no implicit or explicit confirmation will be given to the participants by [CONTACT_5051].  This is a limitation 
of the proposed study and indeed any study with participant -accessible outcomes following an 
intervention. 
Study intervention will be administered at week 0 and at week 2. 
Participants will be evaluated for PTSD symptomatology prior to week 0 and at 8 weeks 
using the Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS -5). They will complete the 
PTSD Checklist  for DSM -5 (PCL-5), the PTSD Checklist – Civilian Version (PCL -C), and the 
M.I.N.I.- Plus Suicidality Items at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks ; they also will complete the M.I.N.I. -
Plus items at screening . The SF -12, GAD-7, PHQ-9, K6, AUDIT -C/AUDIT, and a short pain 
scale will be completed  at weeks 0, 4, and 8.

3.2. Acceptability Study Design  
The qualitative study will use focus groups, small group interviews, and individual 
interviews to compi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] a range of perspectives on service members ’ decision -making processes 
and information needs related to SGB. Participants will include service members, spouses, and 
providers. Data collection will occur at each study site because attit udes conveyed by [CONTACT_795060]. Scheduling will be based on the accumulation of ample service members  indicating an interest in participating.    
Participating service members will have received at least one SG B and/or study procedure 
within  the prior 3 months, although this interval may be expanded if necessary for recruitment 
into focus groups. Because all study staff (with the exception of the physicians administering the study intervention) are blind with re spect to treatment status, participants will include 
participant s from both active and sham procedure arms. To increase homogeneity within focus 
groups and avoid potential distress among participants who do not experience symptom relief, groups will be stratified based on positive versus neutral or negative subjective assessment of change at the 4-week assessmen t (see Section 6.4.12
) or at the time of screening for the 
qualitative study . Because beliefs and attitudes related to behavioral health treatment are likely 
to vary according to pay grade, separate groups will be held for lower enlisted service members and NCOs. Officers, if available as participants, will be interviewed individually.  Data 
collection will address perceived benefits and drawbacks of SGB and other treatment options for PTSD; information needs before, and during the procedure; and participants’ description of the effects of the procedure.  
Spouses may have questions and concerns regarding SGB and other treatment options that 
differ from those of their service members.  Spouses can also provide input that may vary from 
that which is perceived or reported by [CONTACT_795061]. All married service members and their spouses will be eligible to participate in a participant-spouse interview. Data collection with 
spouses will be conducted in joint interviews, in which both members of the couple are interviewed at the same time by [CONTACT_795062].  Interview topi[INVESTIGATOR_795030].  Joint interviews will avoid the risk of inadvertent breach of 
confidentiality among spouses. They  will also allow comparison of the perspectives of the 
spouse and the service member.  
Providers will include physicians who administer SGBs, and both B ehavioral Health 
providers and other (e.g., F amily Medicine) physicians who have or could potentially refer 
service members for the procedure.  Data collection  with providers will consist of small focus 
groups, addressing provider views of how SGB complements or adds to available modalities, and how the procedure should be communicated to service members. If scheduling small focus

5.1. Randomization and Blinding  
Participants eligible for the study will be randomized  to either  the sham or active treatment.  
Randomization will be conducted using a permuted block design and stratified by [CONTACT_795068] 2:1 active:sham ratio is achieved at each  center . 
The control will be a sham injection of saline near the SG.  The physicians administering 
the intervention will perforce be unblinded. However, all others involved in the trial (RC, 
participants , RTI study personnel , etc. ) will be blind to the administered treatment, and the sole 
interaction of the participants with the treating physicians will be in the treatment suite (except as required for participant safety).  Also, the RC will not discuss the post- procedure presence or 
absence of a Horner ’s syndrome with the Investigator or participant . 
5.2. Description and Handling of Study Drug  
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] 0.5% for injection is FDA approved for use in SGB. Sterile 
normal saline for injection also is commercially available.  There will be site -specific protocols 
for drawing up the study drug; these will produce sufficient documentation to identify whi ch 
participants received active or sham intervention.

6.1. Participant Enrollment and Treatment Assignment  
Participants will be active duty service members who meet inclusion criteria (as described 
above). Based on our power calculations, w e anticipate enrolling approximately 240 participants 
(80 per site) into the trial, with 160 being randomized into the active arm and 80 into the control 
arm. Assignment to active or sham will be stratified per site.   
At each of the three study sites, a qualified  Research Coordinator (RC) will be staffed by 
[CONTACT_795070], screening, enrollment, and assessment activities.  While 
these activities will generally be considered  the RC’s responsibility and will primarily be 
completed by [CONTACT_122440], the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_795035], 
screening, enrollment, and assessment activities . For conventional forces, the primary 
mechanism for recruitment will be through B ehavioral Health providers (BHP) or Family 
Medicine or other physicians within the installation referral are a. They  will identify individuals 
whom they think are good candidates for participation in the clinical trial and then briefly 
explain the study. If the service member is interested in participating, then the provider will give the individual an interest card on which contact [CONTACT_795071] (Name, email 
address, phone number). These interest cards will be kept by [CONTACT_795072].  The interest card also will have the email address of the RC . If the 
individual prefers he/she can simply email the RC to indicate interest rather than filling out the interest card.   
We will also post the study’s approved poster at appropriate locations and send  both 
approved poster and e- mail ( Appendix 2 ) through the study sites’ s ocial media outlets, as well 
as in bulletins, newsletters,  listservs , mass e -mail,  an Armed Forces Network (AFN) 
advertisement,  and other electronic means. We will go through proper approval channels for 
official military outlets. RCs may disseminate appro ved study materials at various locations 
where approval to do so has been obtained. Examples may include but are not limited to on-post events where service members, spouses, or others may be present; presentations to Family Readiness Groups and similar organizations; and distribution of study materials at locations within the facilities where large numbers of people are known to pass. We will post approved material on a study Facebook page and ads including only approved materials via Facebook advertising. Additionally, we will engage Public Affairs Officers (PAO) at each study site to  
promote the study via approved news/press and other electronic means .  
We also anticipate that some individuals may “self-refer ” to the study as a result of having 
seen one of the posters or interest cards that may be displayed at the clinics  or simply by [CONTACT_795073]. If these “self-referrers ” contact [CONTACT_795074], they will be 
thanked for their interest and then informed that in order to take part in the study, they need to be referred by a mental health or medical provider.  For [LOCATION_003]SOC, there are two potential 
referral routes. First, currently there are WAMC Behavioral Health assets embedded within [LOCATION_003]SOC; that is, when  [CONTACT_795118] briefs the WAMC Behavioral Health providers, the 
[LOCATION_003]SOC -embedded assets will be included. Second, unit assets within [LOCATION_003]SOC will be made 
familiar with the study ’s protocols and will refer appropriate individuals to the study RC.  
The RC will contact [CONTACT_107461] ( Appendix 2 ) those who have expressed interest in the 
study, to explain the study, including the possibility of being randomized to a sham group, and 
Protocol SGB -[ADDRESS_1096741] agreed to take part in the study, they will be asked a few pre-screening questions over the telephone to determine basic eligibility (i.e., lack of prior SGB procedure, currently on active duty, with access to the 
Internet, no plans to transfer to a different installation in the coming [ADDRESS_1096742]/retir ement, and not undergoing UCMJ or pending legal administrative actions; 
also Appendix 2 ). Those who pre-screen by [CONTACT_795075]. Participants who pre- screen as eligible and are 
located geographically close to the study site will be asked to come to the RC’ s office to 
complete the consenting process in person, and to complete computer- based  screening which 
will assess our other study inclusion and exclusion criteria.  We expect this to be the majority of 
our participants.  
However, because our study sites provide coverage for large geographic areas, we also 
likely will encounter some potential participants who are located a considerable distance from 
the study site, to  the degree that it is impractical for them to physically come to the RC ’s office 
for the screening assessment,  only to return home to wait for their CAPS phone interview.  
Consent will be obtained and documented as described below, and then t hese participa nts will 
be asked to complete the screening questions on- line or via telephone.   
• An electronic copy of the ICF will be made available to the potential participant via the study website or email.  
• The potential participant will be asked to print out a copy of the ICF. 
• The RC will contact [CONTACT_795076]. The RC will answer any questions. 
• The RC will ask for a verbal consent from the potential participant and have that verbal 
consent confirmed by a witness who is with the participant. 
• The RC will ask the participant and the witness to sign the ICF and return the signed signature [CONTACT_795113]: 1) scan the page and uploa d it via RTI ’s secure web system, 2) fax the ICF to the RC, 3) take a photograph 
of the page with a mobile phone or digital camera and upload it via RTI’ s secure web 
system, or 4) return the page via mail.   
• If the participant is deemed eligible and comes i nto the RC’ s office for the baseline 
interview, he/she will be asked to initial and sign a new (and newly witnessed) copy of the consent form before beginning the assessment.  
6.2. Pre-Treatment Assessments  
6.2.1. Screening Visit  
Participants will be screened within 4 weeks prior to randomization to determine eligibility 
for participation in the study. The following will be performed and documented at screening in the RC ’s office , or over the phone if the participant is unable to make a dedicated screening trip 
to the RC’ s office (Appendix 3 ): 
• Obtain written informed consent (see below for subjects unable to come to RC ’s office)

RTI International  
 
 
416632- 2.0_SGB_Bartoszek_v 3 Mar 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41  March 3, 2018  • Assessment of eligibility (see inclusion criteria [4.1.3] and exclusion criteria [4.1.4]) 
• Demographics and screening medical history  performed  by [CONTACT_795077] 
(Appendix 3 )  
• Life Events Checklist -5 (LEC -5; Appendix 4 ), PCL-C (Appendix  6), M.I.N.I. -Plus 
Suicidality Items (Appendix 7 ), AUDIT -C/Audit ( Appendix 8 ) – performed by 
[CONTACT_795078] a baseline CAPS -5. Following administration of the CAPS -5, the RC will contact 
[CONTACT_795079] ’s return to the clinic within [ADDRESS_1096743]- treatment CAPS -5 at week 8 . 
Participants who are not eligible for the study will be so informed, and if they choose this 
information will be provided back to their referring healthcare provider. 
Because some study participants are physically located at a distance from the study site, it 
is possible that some may need to complete their screening remotely . In these instances, the 
prospective participant will receive the same screening content as those who are located locally 
and can complete the assessment in the RC ’s office ; however, they will provide their consent 
over the phone and then the screening will be performed by [CONTACT_122440]. In addition, pre-existing Horner’ s syndrome will be assessed at the first study visit (i.e., week 0) when they present for 
their initial study condition. At that time, intervening physicians will use their clinical judgment to deter mine whether an individual with a pre-existing Horner’ s syndrome would be at 
increased risk from participating in the study. (Note that we expect presentation with a pre-existing Horner’ s syndrome to be very rare - [CONTACT_795119] has indicated that he has never seen  
this in a patient.)  If it is determined by [CONTACT_795080]’ s 
syndrome represents a risk to a study participant, the physician will inform that  individual that 
they are ineligible and will answer any questions the individual might have.  
6.2.2. Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 ( CAPS -5;  
Appendix 9 ) 
The primary outcome measure will be the Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale, or CAPS -5 
(Weathers et al., 2013) ( Appendix 9), which is the gold standard in clinical PTSD assessment. 
The CAPS -5 clinical interview is a 30 -item structured interview that corresponds to the DSM -5 
criteria for PTSD. For each item, standardized questions and probes are provided; total scores range from [ADDRESS_1096744], or LEC-
5 (Weathers et al., 2013) . The LEC -[ADDRESS_1096745] of potential 
traumatic events.  The CAPS -5 is our central outcome measure in support of primary objective 
1. No notes will be added to a participant ’s medical records  record regarding the CAPS -[ADDRESS_1096746] access to medical records .

Study CIs will be recruited from a pool of approximately [ADDRESS_1096748] completed hundreds of diagnostic interviews over the telephone for both the NSDUH Mental Health Surveillance Study (2008-2012) and the Group P roject for 
Holocaust Survivors and Their Children (2013). Based on experience hiring CIs of this caliber for the NSDUH Mental Health Study, the NSDUH Clinical Validation Study, and the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study, we anticipate between 20% and 30% CI attrition; therefore, we will train two more CIs than our goal of four for data collection. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Quality Control  
CAPS -5 training and clinical quality control will be led by a credentialed, licensed,  and 
experienced clinical supervisor (CS) with expertise in PTSD and the CAPS -5. The CS will 
review 100% of hard -copy study clinical interview notes, item-by-item, comparing the notes 
provided by [CONTACT_795081], and listening to the accompanying audio files as needed to 
ensure data accuracy . The CS will also review the full audio recordings for a randomly selected 
10% of the clinical interviews.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Managing Distressed Respondents During CAPS -[ADDRESS_1096749], we will provide explicit protocols 
for CIs to follow if they encounter either passive or active suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Training and supervision will be provided for managing respondents who express sadness, agitation, frustration, or any other strong emotion during the course of the clinical interview. A detailed Distressed Respondent Protocol (DRP) ( Appendix 10 ), which has been successfully 
used for the NSDUH Mental Health Surveillance Study, will be employed for this study. The DRP provides definitions and examples of five types of distressed respondents, along the continuum of no risk of harm (i.e., respondent is agitated or upset) to imminent danger (e.g., respondent reports active suicidal thoughts, a plan, and a means to carry out that plan). The DRP then gives step-by-step instructions for handling each of the five types of distressed respondents. CIs will be thoroughly trained in the use of the DR P.  
The DRP will be very similar to the system described in Section 6.4.13
 regarding 
management of distressed participants during automated assessments. Clinical interviewers will inform individuals at the beginning of the CAPS -5 that they need to obtain the individual’ s 
physical location (address) for the purposes of safety, that such information will not be stored, and that it will only be used in the case of an emergency. In the event that a respondent indicates activ e suicidal or homicidal ideation during their CAPS- 5, the clinician administering the

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43  March 3, 2018  CAPS -5 will call or (in the event that keepi[INVESTIGATOR_795036]) send a 
text message to study co-investigator Kristine Rae Olmsted and study logis tics director Russ 
Vandermaas -Peeler indicating the nature of the ideation, physical location of the respondent (if 
known), and contact [CONTACT_795082]. [CONTACT_795120] or [CONTACT_795121] -
Peeler will immediately call the respondent’s CQ/duty phone number, CO, or 1SG to report the 
incident. Given the emergent nature of active suicidal or homicidal ideation, we believe that using text messaging and/or telephone communications is justified.  
A second measure taken to enhance participant safety relates to the credentials of our CIs 
and the CS. Our study CIs will be seasoned clinicians with experience assessing risk and providing direct care for distressed individuals. Similarly, the CS will be a licensed clinical psychologist and certified health care provider. This supervisor will be integrally involved in supervising the CIs so that if a distressed respondent is encountered, his/her level of risk can be verified, and consultation and debriefing can be provided. After each encounter with a distressed respondent, the CI will immediately contact [CONTACT_795083], the assessment of risk, and the application of the DRP. If unusual circumstances arise, the supervisor will contact [CONTACT_795084].  
Together, these methods have been effective and allowed us to properly handle 201 
incidents of distressed respondents in the NSDUH Mental Health Surveillance Study, which included cases involving suicidal ideation (n=155), homicidal ideation (n=4), and respondents who were agitated or upset (n=42). 
6.2.3. Baseline Assessments (Week 0, immediately before SGB)  
All instrument assessments in the following section will be administered via secure 
computer. Paper- and-pencil (PAPI) versions of the assessments wi ll be available in the event 
that Internet services should be interrupted at a study site . If use of PAPI [INVESTIGATOR_795037], the RC will hand-key the participant’s data upon restoration of Internet services; the original forms will be sent to R TI via a secure FTP site so that a second person can review the 
RC’s data entry for accuracy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urine Pregnancy Test for Females of Child-bearing Potential 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all females of child-bearing potential. A 
positive test will end participation in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 ( PCL-5; Appendix 5) 
The PCL -5 is a 20- item self -report measure that assesses the 20 DSM -5 symptoms of 
PTSD. Its purposes include screening for PTSD and/or provisional diagnosis, and monitoring symptom change before, during, and after treatment. A total symptom severity score ranging from 0 to 80 is possible (Weathers et al., 2013). Data on a clinically meaningful change are not yet available, nor are full psychometrics. We will administer the PCL -5 at baseline in order to 
be consistent with our use of the CAPS-5, and in order to establish a baseline score in support of 
secondary objective 1. (Note that we are including the instrument in this study at all assessment time points, despi[INVESTIGATOR_795038], because it represents the most up -to-date standard of self- administered PTSD assessment.) 
We anticipate that full psychometrics will be available for our final data analysis in 2017.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44  March 3, 2018  [IP_ADDRESS]. PTSD Checklist  - Civilian Version  (PCL -C; Appendix 6) 
There are three versions of the PCL for DSM -IV, including the PCL-C for civilians. This 
standardized assessment comprises 17 items corresponding to the key symptoms of PTSD from 
the DSM -IV. The total symptom severity score ranges from 17 to 85. The PCL- C has been 
thoroughly validated and deemed reliable (Convbeare, Behar, Solomon, Newman, Borkovec, 
2012; Weathers et al., 1993) . Because data regarding clinically meaningful change are 
unavailable for the PCL -5, and because full psychometrics for the PCL-5 are not yet available, 
we will be administering the PCL -C at baseline in order to establish study eligibility as well as a 
baseline score in support of secondary objective 1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.)- Plus Suicidality Items 
(Appendix 7) 
The M.I.N.I. -Plus is a structured interview for diagnosing DSM- IV and ICD -10 psychiatric 
disorders (Sheehan et al., 1998). This study will use a subset of items from the full instrument 
geared toward identifying individuals experiencing suicidal ideation in the past 2 months. Response options are dichotomous (yes/no) and questions ask about desire, thoughts, planning, taking steps toward, and attempting suicide as well as deliberate injury without intent to kill oneself. Individuals answering affirmatively to any of the first 7 items regarding suicidal ideation in the previous 2 months will be asked to complete an additional 4 questions regarding 
any current  desire to harm themselves, thoughts about suicide, plans for suicide, and active 
steps they may be taking.  
The suicidal ideation assessment will be administered at initial screening so as to identify 
(and exclude) individuals deemed to be at elevated risk for suicide attempt. Those who screen  
positive on the M.I.N.I.-Plus items, who are then asked the follow-up items regarding current ideation, will be excluded from the study; they will be evaluated and managed per the 
appropriate site- specific Standard Operatin g Procedure (SOP). The assessment will also be 
administered on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Because screening will already have taken place, these 
enrolled part icipants will still be included in the study.  This instrument will enhance participant 
safety and su pport secondary objective 3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. AUDIT -C/AUDIT  (Appendix 8) 
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, 
& Monteiro, 2001) will be used to assess potential alcohol abuse symptoms. The instrument was developed as a means of brief assessment and screening for excessive drinking. This 10- item 
scale is widely used and has been shown to be consistent with ICD -10 definitions for alcohol 
dependence and harmful alcohol use (Allen, Litten, Fertig, & Babor, 1997; Saunders, Aasland, Amundsen, & Grant, 1993).  
The AUDIT -C (AUDIT alcohol consumption questions) consists of the first [ADDRESS_1096750]; only 
those screening positive on these items will receive the remaining 7 items  of the full AUDIT.  It 
is administered in support of secondary objective 3.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45  March 3, 2018  [IP_ADDRESS]. K6 (Appendix 11) 
The K6 was developed for use in the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) as a 
means of assessing nonspecific psychological distress. While this study ’s active duty military 
population with PTSD may  not be representative of the U.S. general population (Kessler et al., 
2003; Kessler et al. 2002), we are including the K6 so as to assess any changes in serious 
psychological distress over time among study participants (secondary objective 3).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. PHQ-9 ( Appendix 12) 
Depression symptoms will be assessed using the validated PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2002) in support of secondary objective 3. The PHQ-9 was developed as a short form of the full Patient He alth Questionnaire , which was a self -administered version of the PRIME-
MD instrument (Kroenke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], & Williams, 2001; Kroenke & Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], 2002; Löwe, Unutzer, Callahan, Perkins, & Kroenke, 2004).   [IP_ADDRESS]. GAD-7 ( Appendix 13) 
Generalized anxiety symptoms will b e assessed via the GAD -7 (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Kroenke, 
Williams, & Löwe, 2006) in support of secondary objective 3. The instrument was designed to be administered in general health settings as part of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME -MD) assessm ent (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]., 1994), and has been validated by a number 
of studies (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443]., 2006; Kroenke, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Williams, Monahan, & Löwe, 2007).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. SF-12 (Version 2.0) ( Appendix 14) 
The SF -12 is a shortened version of the SF-36, which was designed as a general health 
utility index. Consisting of 12 items, the SF-12v2 improves on the original SF-12 and includes 
simplified wording, better usability, and multi-level response options. The twelve  items provide 
an estimate for eight domains  of functional health and well-being: physical functioning, role-
physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Together, the first four domains constitute a Physical Health summary measure, and the second 4 constitute a Mental Health summary measure (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996; SF -
36.org, n.d.).
 This assessment will be used as a measure of general functioning in support of 
secondary objective 4.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Short pain scale ( Appendix 15) 
Because pain f requently presents with PTSD and may play a confounding role in treatment 
effectiveness ( Beck & Clapp, 2011; Kulich, Mencher, Bertrand, & Maciewicz, 2000; Moeller-
Bertram, Keltner, & Strigo, 2012), we will administer a 0 -10 Likert- type numeric pain scale 
where 0 represents “No pain,” 5 represents “Moderate pain, ” and 10 represents “Worst possible 
pain.” While Visual Analog Scales, Verbal Rating Scales, and Numeric Rating Scales have all 
been deemed valid and reliable (Williamson & Hoggart, 2005) , we opted for a numeric scale 
due to prospective study participants ’ likelihood of being familiar with the scale, which is 
commonly used in clinical practice at the three participating study sites. The pain  scale will be 
administered in support of secondary objective 3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Current Medications ( Appendix 16) 
In order to assess the potential impact of medication use concurrent with study participation, 
we will ask study participants about their use of prescription psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (including stimulants, 
Protocol SGB -201 Amendment 2.0

sympathomimetics/sympatholytics.  Given that the mechanism of action of SGB is unknown but 
likely involves some combination of central, peripheral, and autonomic pathways, use of these medications could be confounding. These data will be collected to support secondary objective 2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Questions ( Appendix 17) 
Additional questions will be asked at week [ADDRESS_1096751] been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress (PTS) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and if so, the month and year when they received this diagnosis. For those who indicate that they have not been diagnosed, we will ask for the approximate month and year when their symptoms started.  
Similarly, because nicotine has a direct impact on the sympathetic nervous system, we will 
ask study participants four items that will allow for calculation of estimated pack years for cigarette smoking. These items will establish age at initiation of regular smoking, smoking 
longevity (whether they have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime), recency of regular smoking, and number of cigarettes typi[INVESTIGATOR_795039]. The resulting pack- year estimate will be 
assessed for any moderation of treatment effects among study participants. A similar estimate will be computed for chewing tobacco, snuff, or other smokeless tobacco exposure.  
6.3. Treatment  and Treatment  Assessments (Weeks 0 and 2) 
The PCL -5, PCL- C, K6 , and the M.I.N.I. -Plus Suicidality Items  will be administered prior 
to the procedure at week 2.  
Standard  right- sided  SGBs will be performed in accordance with this protocol (
Section 
3.1). On the day of the procedure, clinic nursing staff will perform standard nursing intake to 
include brief interim history, review of systems, vital signs, and placement of intravenous catheter.  Females of child -bearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test.  The treating  
physician will perform a targeted history and physical, paying attention to potential contrai ndications to SGB. At week 0, the physician will also give a brief explanation of the 
procedure as well as a review of risks and potential benefits, though these will have been described to them beforehand.  
Injections will be performed under ultrasound vi sualization . The study medication will be 
either 7 -10 mL 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_795040] (around and 
into the ventral fascia) and into the longus coli immediately dorsal to the presumed ventral fascia,  at the level  of the C6 anterior tubercle (landmarks for the stellate ganglion; active study 
medication) or 1-2 mL preservative free normal saline  injected anterolateral to the anterior 
tubercle of C6  (sham procedure ). The treating physician will access participant assignment 
(performed at RTI per protocol) via email from RTI ’s central office. The participant will not be 
informed which treatment he or she is receiving; for blinding purposes, the same type of syringes wil l be used for both injections. Similarly, the same number and types of syringes and 
other supplies should be placed on the sterile procedure table regardless to which intervention (SGB or sham) the participant has been randomized. The interaction of the treating physician with the participant will be scripted as much as possible  (Appendix 1 8). Customary vital signs 
will be recorded . MEDCOM 40 -54 dated Feb 09 provides “ a standard process and procedure for

procedures”. In accordance with this regulation, the participant’s identity, the procedure to be 
performed, and the specific site of the procedure will be verified.  A separate paper CRF will be created for the procedure; this information will not be shared with anyone outside the treatment suite (RC, participant, other members of the RTI Project Team, etc.).  It is critical that only the 
physician administering the treatment (and his immediate team) be aware of the participant’ s 
assignment to active or sham intervention. Following the intervention, the treating physician 
should have no further contact [CONTACT_795057].  
Immediately following each SGB procedure, the subject will be observed in the procedure 
suite prior to transport to the recovery area for assessment of potential complications that could require immediate intervention,  according to local clinic policy. The participant then will be 
taken to the post-procedure recovery area, where monitoring of vital signs will continue under the supervision of the recovery nurse for [ADDRESS_1096752]-procedure for his/her Horner’ s 
syndrome, recording the time post-SGB and using the following metrics (0 for absent, 1 for slight, 2 for obvious) when the participant is sitting up straight and not facing a bright light: 
ptosis scleral injection  
miosis   
Assuming the absence of complications requiring further evaluation or treatment, the 
participant will be given discharge instructions, and will be required to verbally indicate 
understanding of signs and symptoms that would require emergency care (e.g., shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, increasing neck pain). In addition, the clinic nurse will remind the participant that soreness at the injection site, a full sensation of the throat, and Horner’ s 
symptomology may occur for 6-18 hours (the duration of effect of the local anesthetic) ; if the 
recurrent laryngeal nerve has been blocked, there may also be hoarseness and difficulty swallowing. The participa nt then will be allowed to leave the clinic per local site policy . 
6.4. Post-Treatment Assessments  (Weeks 4, 6, and 8) 
With the exception of the final CAPS -5, it is expected that these instruments  will be 
completed  by [CONTACT_795085] a secure Web -based platform. For 
analytical  purposes, each follow-up period will begin [ADDRESS_1096753] via a secure web portal on the participant ’s device of choice (i.e., there will be no 
interaction between the participant and the RC at these times).  If an individual affirmatively on 
any of the first seven M.I.N.I. -Plus items regarding suicidal ideation in the previous [ADDRESS_1096754] on a plan, an automated participant safety 
system will be triggered (see Section 6.4.13 ). 
6.4.5. AUDIT -C/AUDIT  
The AUDIT -C and, if the participant screens positive, the full AUDIT, will be repeated at 
weeks 4 and 8 in support of secondary objective 3. 
6.4.6. K6 
The K6 will be repeated at weeks 4, 6, and 8 in support of secondary objective 3. 
6.4.7. PHQ -9 
The PHQ -9 will be repeated at weeks 4 and 8 in support of secondary objective 3. 
6.4.8. GAD-7 
The GAD-7 will be repeated at weeks 4 and 8 in support of secondary objective 3. 
6.4.9. SF-12 
The SF -12 will be repeated at weeks 4 and 8  in support of secondary objective 4. 
6.4.10. Short Pain Scale  
The short pain scale will be repeated at weeks 4 and 8 in support of secondary objective 3. 
6.4.11. Current Medications  
Current medications will be reassessed at weeks 4 and 8 in support of secondary objective 2. 
6.4.12. Additional Questions  
Additional questions will be asked of study participants at follow -up time points as follows. 
Subjective Assessment of Change. For purposes of stratifying participants for qualitative 
analysis (see Section 3.2 ), we will ask participants overall how they are feeling at 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_1096755] initial treatment compared to how they were feeling before having the procedure. Response options will be categorical.  
Subjective Assessment of Treatment Group. At week 4, in order to analyze participants ’ 
beliefs regarding whether they were randomized to the study’ s active or sham treatment arm (in 
support of secondary obje ctive 2), we will ask participants whether they believe they received 
an “active ” procedure or an “ imitation ” procedure.  
Protocol SGB -[ADDRESS_1096756] the capability to send messages to the participant and to key study 
staff in the event that a participant indicates a cl inically significant risk of suicide.   If an 
individual answers “ yes” to any of the initial seven questions concerning suicidal ideation in the 
past two months, they then will be asked an additional [ADDRESS_1096757] on a plan, an automated system will be triggered with the following results: 
• A message will be displayed on the participant’s screen that says the following: “Given your responses to some of these questions, we are concerned about your safety. As you were told when you signed your consent form to participate in this study, we are contact[CONTACT_795086]. We would like for you to please go to your nearest Emergency Room for assistance. In addition, please click below to indicate that you agree not to harm yourself before you get to the Emergency Room.”  
• A text message providing the service member ’s name [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her command contact 
[CONTACT_3031]  (name, telephone number, and email) will be generated and sent to the 
following RTI staff: 
‒ The RC at the site  
‒ Kristine Rae Olmsted (KRO)  
‒ Russ Vandermass -Peeler (RVP)  
• RTI staff will contact [CONTACT_2299]’s command by [CONTACT_795087]/duty phone 
number. If that is unsuccessful, they will contact [CONTACT_2299]’ s First Sergeant or 
Commanding Officer. 
‒ The RC will be the first level responder, since he/she is local  
‒ If the RC doesn’t respond in 2 hours, KRO and RVP will respond. 
• Per site policy, Behavioral Health will be notified by [CONTACT_795088]. 
6.5. Acceptability Study Procedures  
6.5.1. Participant Recruitment and Group Assignment  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Service Members  
Clinical Effectiveness  Trial Participants  
All service members enrolled in the trial will be eligible for the qualitative study if they 
have received at least one SGB study procedure during the three months prior to qualitative data 
collection and if participation would not cause undue distress, as described below.  During 
Baseline Assessment, the RC will describe the qualitative study, following the recruitment script included in  Appendix 19-[ADDRESS_1096758] Sheet included as Appendix 19 -4. If the 
individual prefers, he/she can also  email the RC later to indicate interest.  
Additionally, site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_795041] e in for a n SGB  in the three months prior to qualitative 
data collection. This list will be securely stored in a locked cabinet and securely shredded when 
recruitment for the qualitative has been completed. The PI, clinic staff , or RCs will contact 
[CONTACT_795089] e- mail to see if they are interested  in the qualitative 
study following the recruitment script included in Appendi x 19-3. Potentially  eligible 
individuals will receive up to [ADDRESS_1096759] Sheet included as Appendix 
19-4. If the individual prefers, he/she can also  contact [CONTACT_795090] .  
Group Assignment 
Assignment to specific focus groups will be based on pay grade and subjective assessment 
of change as reported at the 4 Week assessment  or at the time of screening for the qualitative 
study. In order to maximize homogeneity, lower enlisted service members and NCOs will be assigned to different groups. These groups will be further divided so that those reporting positive change since the procedure will be assigned to a different group than those reporting no change or feeling worse than at the time of the pr ocedure. Depending on the number of eligible 
participants by [CONTACT_795091], of ficers  may be interviewed individually.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51  March 3, 2018  [IP_ADDRESS]. Service Member/Spouse Dyads  
Eligible participants will be service members who meet the above criteria and whose 
spouse has expressed interest in participating in the qualitative study. Joint interview 
participants will not be allowed to also participate in focus groups. For service members who have indicated an interest in participating in focus groups , the RC will identify marital status 
from participant s’ demographic data or by [CONTACT_795092] ’s spouse is currently living with him /her. If so, t he RC will offer these service members 
a recruitment Fact Sheet (Appendix 19-5) for the joint interviews.  Interested spouses will 
contact [CONTACT_122440], who will use the recruitment script  (Appendix 19-6) to describe the study and 
confirm interest.  The RC will invite service members and spouses by [CONTACT_6968] (again including the 
Fact Sheet)  or phone to participate in a dyadic interview.  
Participants in joint interviews will include lower enlisted and NCOs, and service members  
will be  stratified by [CONTACT_795093].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Providers  
Eligible participants for the provider focus groups will be Behavioral Health or other (e.g., 
Family Medicine) clinicians who  have referred or  could potentially refer service members  for 
SGB for PTSD  symptoms, as well as physicians who provide SGBs. The RC will identify 
eligible clinicians  in consultation with  the site PIs and  study records . These individuals will be 
invited to participate in a small focus group through an email sent by [CONTACT_7880]  [INVESTIGATOR_541741] . Sample 
text for this email is included in Appendix 19-7. A Fact Sheet describing the study will be 
attached to this email, included as Appendix 19-8.  
6.5.2. Data Collection 
Focus group interviews are planned; these are structured discussions on a particular topic 
involving a small number of people under the direction of a moderator (Krueger & Casey, 
2000).
 The method relies on both the interactive social context of the discussion and on the 
individual experiences of each of the group members to produce a rich discussion in which shared experiences stimulate individual contributions. A methodological review by [CONTACT_795094]  (2015) notes that joint interviews in which couples who are interviewed together offer 
similar advantages, with the opportunity for individuals to support and prompt each other, and offer contrasting perspectives on shared events. The authors further note that interviews have been  found particularly useful in describing health- related decision -making.  
The qualitative study will explore participants ’ perceptions of SGB in relation to other 
options for treatment of PTSD, from the perspectives of service members, service member/spouse couples, and providers. Broad topi[INVESTIGATOR_795042], service members/spouse interviews, and provider focus group are compared in in Table 3. The topic guide for service member focus groups is included as Appendix 19-9, for service member 
and spouse interviews as Appendix 19-10, and for provider focus groups as Appendix 19-11. If 
it is necessary to interview officers individually, questions will follow those in the service members topic guide. We anticipate that focus groups and small group interviews will take approximately 90 minutes, service member- significant other interviews will take approximately 
60 minutes, and individual interviews will take approximately 45 minutes.

All focus groups and interviews will be led  by a study team member with prior experience 
in qualitative data collection with clinicians and service members engaged in mental health 
treatment. Real -time notes will be collected by a second team member.  We will also audio -
record each focus group or interview, if all participants give permission to do so. The purpose of the audio recordings is to augment any notes taken by [CONTACT_795095] (for instance, if the note-taker misses something said by a group participant, they may need to consult the audio recordings to clarify). We will use a digital recorder for this purpose, with each session’ s file 
transferred to an encrypted laptop immediately after the session, then deleted from the digital recorder.  Participants will not be personally identified in these notes, but will instead be 
indicated generically, such as “Respondent 1” or “Respondent 2.”  
Data from focus groups and interviews will be summarized in topline notes as soon as 
feasible after  data collection. In -depth analysis  will employ standar d qualitative methods. All 
notes will be entered into qualitative data base software such as NVivo 9 (QSR  International Pty 
Ltd. Version 9, 2010)
 to facilitate coding and retrieval. Analysis will be both deductive, 
following a hierarchical coding structure based on topic guide questions, and inductive, creating queries to assess patterns observed in the data and hypotheses emerging from preliminary analyses.

6.5.3. Managing Distressed Participants During Data Collection 
Discussion of PTSD treatment experiences may be distressing to participants. We will 
remind all participants  of counseling resources available to them if they wish to discuss further 
any issue addressed or suggested by [CONTACT_795096]. Contact [CONTACT_795097]’ s 
chaplain services, Behavioral  Health services, and substance abuse services, as well as Military  
OneSource, will be attached to each participant ’s copy of the informed consent forms. In 
addition, research team members will have contact [CONTACT_795098]. These providers will be contact[CONTACT_795099] ’ behavior raises concerns that they will harm themselves or

be used in the event of any urgent threat to safety. 
6.6. Assessments for Premature Discontinuation from Study  
The study is designed as intention- to-treat, and therefore participants will not be excluded 
after randomization.  If a participant discontinues further treatment or  participation in the  study, 
for example as a result of an adverse event (AE , Section 7 ), every attempt should be made to 
continue to perform the required study- related  follow-up and procedures (see Section  6.7, 
Criteria for Suspension of Study Treatment ). If this is not possible or acceptable to the 
participant or Investigator, the participant may be withdrawn from the study.  
6.7. Criteria for Suspension of Study Treatment  
Study intervention may be discontinued in the following instances: 
• Intercurrent illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator , affect assessments 
of clinical status to a significant degree.  
• Unacceptable toxicity that compromises the ab ility to continue study- specific 
procedures, or is considered to not be in the participant’ s best interest.  
• Participant request to discontinue for any reason. 
• Participant non-compliance.  
• Pregnancy during the first two weeks of the study, when study- related  treatment 
procedures (either active or sham) are being conducted . 
• Discontinuation of the study at the request of the relevant  IRB.

7.1. Research Monitor 
This trial is not a safety study; SGB is a well-studied procedure with a low probability of 
serious adverse events (Wulf & Maier, 1992), and a smaller volume of saline injected 
superficially to the region of the SG would be expected to result in  even fewer  serious adverse 
events. Nevertheless, reports of adverse events wi ll be collected during the trial, and t he 
Research Monitor is required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to volunteers 
or others, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and all volunteer deaths associated with the protocol 
and provide an unbiased w ritten report of the  event . At a minimum the Research Monitor should 
comment on the outcomes of the event or problem and in the case of a SAE or death comment on the relationship to participation in the study. The Research Monitor should also indicate 
whether he/she concurs with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_2035]. All unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others will be promptly reported to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC  Office of Research  Protection (ORP) Human Research Protection Office ( HRPO) 
by [CONTACT_756] ([PHONE_164]), by [CONTACT_6968] (

Medical Resear ch and Materiel Command, ATTN: MCMR -RP, [ADDRESS_1096761] the safety and well -being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the Monitor’ s 
report.  It is the Research Monitor’s responsibility to promptly report their observations and 
finding to the IRB. There should be no conflict of interest for the Monitor, and the Monitor cannot be under the supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_795044]. If the duties of the Research Monitor could require disclosure of participants ’ Protected Health Information 
outside a covered entity (i.e., the Monitor is not an agent of the covered entity), the institution responsible for the protection of human subjects may require the identity and location of the Research Monitor to be described in the study Health Information Portability and Accountability Act authorization.  
7.2. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre- or post -treatment 
complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture, biopsy, etc.). Pre-existing events which increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of use of a medicinal product in human clinical trials will also be considered AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55  March 3, 2018  Any reported  medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an 
onset date before the screening visit and not related to study procedures is considered to be pre-
existing, and should be documented in the case report form.  
Any AE (i.e., a new e vent or an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition) with an onset date 
after the screening visit up to the last day on study (including the follow-up, off study medication period of the study), should be recorded as an AE on the appropriate CRF page(s).  
An AE does not include: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event. 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detec ted prior 
to the screening visit that do not worsen. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or convenience admissions). 
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the participant is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]. 
The risks attributable to the trial itself originate from the sham procedure arm and include 
those associated with  the sham  saline injection itself . These would be expected to be 
significantly lower than those associated with the “ active ” SGB, for which “ severe 
complications ” (e.g., seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_795045], pneumothorax, allergic 
reactions)  have been reported to be 0.17% (Wulf & Maier, 1992). It is also possible that 
participants may learn inadvertently the intervention group to which they were randomized, and that those who learn they were randomized to a sham procedure may react negatively to this information. These individuals may present to their regular health care provider(s), the Department of Behavioral Health, their local emergency department, or other relevant resources 
should they wish. 
Unanticipated problems involving risk to volunteers or others, SAE related to participation 
in the study and all volunteer deaths related to participation in the study should be promptly reported to the HRPO by [CONTACT_756] ([PHONE_164]), by e- mail ( usarmy.detrick.medcom-

Detrick, Maryland [ZIP_CODE]. The Research Monitor also should be promptly informed.   
7.3. Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_795101], 
including the date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug or study procedures, outcome and action taken with study medication.  
The relationship to study drug therapy or study procedures should be assessed using the 
following definitions: 
• Definitely Not Related : The participant did not receive the study drug and/or study 
procedure, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the study drug or performance of the procedure is not reasonable, or there is another obvious cause of the AE/SAE.

416632- 2.0_SGB_Bartoszek_v 3 Mar 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56  March 3, 2018  • Possibly Related: There is evidence of exposure to the study drug and/or study 
procedure, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the study drug or performance of the procedure is reasonable, but the AE/SAE could have been due to another cause. 
• Definitely Related : There is evidence of exposure to the study drug and/or study 
procedure, the temporal  sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration  of the 
study drug and/or study procedure is reasonable, the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_250242]/or study procedure than by [CONTACT_364820], and the AE/SAE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the study drug or study drug class and/or the study procedure.  
These criteria in addition to good clinical judgment should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment.  If it is f elt that the event is not related to study drug therapy, 
then an alternative explanation should be provided. 
7.4. Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
AE r eports (including SAE reports, Section 7.5
) will be included in the contin uing review 
reports and in the regularly scheduled re-approval applications to the IRB of record. 
7.5. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is defined as follows:  
• Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
o Death;  
o Life-threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death); 
o In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (excluding 
those for study therapy or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated 
with other serious events);  
o Persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
o Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug; 
o Other: medically significant events that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a SAE when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples  of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

416632- 2.0_SGB_Bartoszek_v 3 Mar 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57  March 3, 2018  • Death is an outcome of an adverse event, and not an adverse event in itself. In reports 
of death due to “ Disease Progression ,” where no other information is provided, the 
death will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease being t reated 
with the study drug(s). 
• All deaths, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported for subjects on study 
and for deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_1096763] 
study evaluation, whichever is longer. 
• “Occurri ng at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the 
time of the event.  Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event. 
• “Life-threaten ing” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is a SAE.  
• “In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475067], for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department.  
• The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. An AE that is assessed as 
grade 4 (potentially life-threatening) should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as grade 4.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes as described above. 
7.6. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
7.6.1. All Serious Adverse Events  
RTI International , the Research Monitor, and HRPO must be notified immediately 
regarding the occurrence of any unanticipated and/or serious adverse event that occurs after the 
screening visit, including serious adverse events resulting from study procedures performed from screening onwards. The procedures for reporting all serious adverse events, regardless of causal relationship, are as follows: 
• Record the unanticipated and/or SAE on the AE CRF and complete the “Serious 
Adverse Event Report” form.  
‒ Fax and email  the serious adverse event report to the attention of RTI International  
and HRPO within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Contact 
[CONTACT_471328]. 
‒ For fatal or life -threatening events, also fax  and email  copi[INVESTIGATOR_5913], autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable.

Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as adverse events or serious adverse 
events unless they are associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, etc.) independent from the underlying medical condition, that require medical or surgical intervention, or lead to study drug interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In 
addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g. electrocardiogram, X- rays, vital sig ns) 
that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an adverse event (or serious adverse event) as described in Sections 7.[ADDRESS_1096766] the syndrome or diagnosis. 
Severity should be recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. For adver se events associated with laboratory 
abnormalities, the event should be graded based on the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions, which may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. 
7.8. Risks for Women of Childbearing Potential or during Pregnancy

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61  March 3, 2018  8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1. Primary Analysis 
Data analysis will be performed according to the intent- to-treat principle. The primary 
outcome of this study (difference in CAPS-5 total syndrome score from baseline) will be tested 
for differences between arms. The primary outcome will be analyzed using a linear model for continuous variable that accounts for treatment assignment, site and other factors. Adjusted estimates of the difference in the change between the two arms and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be produced. 
8.2. Secondary Analysis 
The treatment effect on the clinical criteria of PTSD as measured by [CONTACT_77514] -5 over time 
will be assessed at weeks 2,  4, 6 and 8 using a generalized-linear mixed model to account for 
temporal correlation between weekly measures and the clustering of the d ata; this model will 
control for treatment, week, site, baseline PCL-[ADDRESS_1096770] interaction between treatment and time. The outcome variable will be a binary variable denoting positive diagnosis. Because the psychometric properties of this ins trument are still under development, details of 
the cut point definitions will be described more fully in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), based on either published results of those psychometric studies currently ongoing, or preliminary psychometric analyses of data from this study, as deemed most appropriate when the SAP is developed. Adjusted and unadjusted probabilities of benefit of treatment at each time point will be produced using contingency table analysis (log-likelihood chi-square) and generalized -mixed models, correspondingly. 
Effects of treatment on individual items from the  PCL -[ADDRESS_1096771] in the improvement or reduction of relevant health and psychological 
status informa tion such as suicidal thoughts ( M.I.N.I. -Plus Suicidality), psychological distress 
(K6), anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and pain (short pain scale) will be analyzed using similar modeling techniques with either linear mixed models or general ized 
models used appropriately for the structure of the outcome measure (continuous, binary, ordinal, nominal). Each model will incorporate treatment, baseline measure, site, and time as categorical variables and two -way interactions between treatment and time and appropriate confounding 
variables.  Models exploring change through time will account for the repeated measures 
(longitudinal) and clustering effects (participants). Models evaluating the different scores at different time points will account for the site effect, baseline measure and concomitant variables and comorbidities relevant to the different outcomes. 
Similarly, improvement in physical and mental composite measures (SF -12) due to 
treatment effect will be analyzed using linear mixed models at each time point, or comparing 
the scores at different time points.  As before, the effects will be adjusted by [CONTACT_795104], site, and concomitant variables and comorbidities relevant to these measures.  
Another secondary analysis of intere st is to determine the efficacy of the SGB among the 
participants for whom the stellate ganglion was anesthetized effectively.  The population that 
will be utilized for this analysis will be defined as the “Horner’s responder population.” The

RTI International  
 
 
416632- 2.0_SGB_Bartoszek_v 3 Mar 2018  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62  March 3, 2018  analytic appro ach will mirror that for the primary analysis but will utilize only Horner ’s 
responders from the active treatment arm, with propensity scores as described in the SAP to 
select the appropriate sub -population among the control arm participants . 
8.3. Power and Sam ple Size 
Because the proposal for the current study was written before the publication of the DSM-
5, we initially based sample size estimates on known characteristics of the CAPS related to the 
DSM -IV. Weathers et al.  (2001) indicate that a minimum clinica lly significant change in the 
prior version of CAPS total symptom score was 15, and data available from multiple PTSD 
trials in both civilian and military populations indicate that a reasonable conservative estimate of post-treatment standard deviation in CAPS -IV total symptom score was 25. Based on these 
assumptions, a study of 240 participants randomized at a 2:[ADDRESS_1096772] size doesn ’t account for a placebo effect, we also 
examined the power of a study of this size to detect a 10-point difference in the two arms, and the proposed study will have a power of 0.[ADDRESS_1096773] become available regarding the CAPS- 5. 
Although initial psychometric properties are still being analyzed (Weathers et al., 2017), 
consultants from the National Center for PTSD have suggested that 8-[ADDRESS_1096774] recently communicated with Frank Weathers, co -author of the CAPS, and he conveyed the following:  
 
“There isn't a well -validated change score, but most people are using somewhere 
around 8 to 10 points for the CAPS-5. They also use loss of diagnosis or moving into a lower severity range as alternative indicators. In case you don't have them, here are the rationally derived CAPS- 5 severity score ranges.” 
 
Additionally, Paula Schnurr at the National Center for PTSD told us: 
“We have not finalized a number but I am suggesting somewhere between 8 and 10.  I think 10 is probably better given the larger number of sxs in the criteria, despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] 0-4 scoring on the CAPS. In our prior work with the CAPS-IV, we had defined 10 points as response…”  
 
Given this “new” information, we are establishing a 10-point (rather than 15-point) change 
in CAPS score from baseline to follow-up eight weeks after stellate ganglion block as our primary outcome measure to indicate clinically significant and meaningful decrease in PTSD symptoms.  
 
8.4. Attrition  
Loss to follow-up is always a concern where statistical power is necessary for rigorous 
research. In the event that we see as high as 25% attrition between our baseline and 8- week 
follow-up assessment, we will still have power of mor e than 0.[ADDRESS_1096775] seen a greater than 80% follow -up rate at 3 months, whereas the current study entails only 
2 months of participation.

9.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
9.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full compliance with the 
principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong 
Kong, and South Africa), ICH guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant . Each study Investigator, as well as staff charged with the handling of confidential 
study data, will be required to maintain current human subjects training affiliated with their respective institution through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI).  
9.1.2. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the participant (such as 
advertisements, participant information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain 
informed consent) will be submitted, by [CONTACT_737], to an IRB.  Approval from the 
committee must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to 
the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. 
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB approval must also be 
submitted to the committee for approval prior to implementation.  
9.1.3. After local IRB approval, the Protocol then must be submitted to HRPO for approval, which also must be documented before enrolling of participants may begin. ’ Informed Consent  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Clinical Trial 
For the effectiveness clinical trial, it is the responsibility of the Investigator or his designee 
(e.g., the Research Coordinator) to obtain written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and prior to undertaking any study- related procedures.  The 
discussion mus t take place in a private setting.  The Investigator must utilize an IRB-approved 
consent form for documenting written informed consent. A model consent form is provided in Appendix 20-1. Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by [CONTACT_795105] ; all other pages of the consent are to be initialed by 
[CONTACT_2299], also . The informed consent form does not explicitly describe the Horner’ s 
syndrome evaluations to be performed by [CONTACT_122440]; they add no risk, and we do not wish to draw attention to this participant-observable phenomenon which may unblind the participant. 
During the consent process it will be made clear to potential participants that if they 
indicate an intention to harm themselves or somebody else during the trial , their command will 
be notified. This includes verbal indications as well as those during online assessments, should relevant items be answered in such a way as to indicate emergent suicidal ideation. Those indicating emergent suicidal ideation during an online assessment (Section 6.4.13) will see a message on their screen recommending that they go to their nearest Emergency Department

screen) that they will not act on any suicidal thoughts before presenting to the ED. 
There may be potential participants referred to the study who are unable to travel to one of 
the three trial sites prior to a scheduled intervention (given TAMC ’s catchment area is the 
Pacific Basin and LRMC provides care for active duty service members  throughout Europe, 
Africa, and the Middle East).  In those instances, an initial informed consent will be obtained via 
telephone and secure digital communication (see Section 6.1 ) prior to the screening evaluation. 
In such cases, a second physical informed consent document will be signed when the participant 
comes for his or her baseline evaluation. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Acceptability Study 
The Fact Sheet provided to service members at baseline data collection will describe the 
voluntary and confidential nature of the qualitative acceptability  study. A second copy of this 
document will be provided to participants when they are scheduled to take part in a focus group or interview.   
At each focus group or interview, the study team will review the Informed Consent Form 
with participants. The consent form for service member focus groups is included as Appendix  
20-2; for service members who are interviewed individually as Appendix 20-3; for service 
member and spouse interviews is included as Appendix 20-4; and for provider focus groups as 
Appendix 20-5. Consent forms explain who we are, how participants were selected, the 
voluntary nature of participation in the qualitative study, including the right not to participate, the right to not answer specific questions, and the right to withdraw from the focus group at any time with no consequences. The consent form also expla ins the time required to complete the 
focus group, the nature of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_410690], the purpose of the focus group, and the protection of confidentiality of participants. Additionally, the consent form provides contact [CONTACT_795106] ’s Office of Research Protection in case a 
respondent has any questions about the study or his or her rights as a participant.  
To protect confidentiality of participants who have been diagnosed with a serious mental 
health condition, w e are requesting a waiver of signed consent for service members. All 
participants will be given a copy of the consent form to take with them if they choose. A list of counseling resources (on- installation and Military OneSource) will be attached to participant’ s 
copy of the consent form.  
9.1.4. Confidentiality  
The Investigator must assure that participants ’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and 
that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties  regarding the randomized controlled 
trial portion of the study. Only participant initials and an identification code (i.e., not names) 
should be recorded on any form submitted to the sponsor and IRB. The Investigator must keep a 
screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all participants screened and for all 
participants enrolled in the trial.  Regarding the qualitative acceptability study, participants in 
group settings will be provided the same assurances of anonymity and data protection from t he 
study staff’s perspective, and we will request that those participating in group settings not reveal the identities of any other participants. Study staff, however, cannot guarantee that participants 
will keep their own participation (or that of others) confidential.  
Study Files and Retention of Records. 
Protocol SGB -[ADDRESS_1096776] of the 
study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents 
should be classified into 2 separate categories (although not limited to) the following: (1) Investigator’ s study file, and (2) participant clinical source documents.  
The Investigator’ s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, 
IRB and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
Participant clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_795107]/safety parameters independent of the CRFs) would include (although not be limited 
to) the following: participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse ’s notes, appointment 
book, original laboratory reports, electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollment log, etc.  
All clinical study documents must be r etained by [CONTACT_11219]/or RTI until seven  
years from the date when the financial status report is submitted . Investigators may be required 
to retain documents longer if required by [CONTACT_795108]. The Investigator must notify RTI International prior to destroying any 
clinical study records. 
Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to 
another location, RTI International must be notified in advanc e. 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and RTI International to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of an audit. Where source documents are required for the 
continued care of the participant , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_527809]. 
9.1.5. Case Report Forms  
For each participant enrolled  in the clinical trial, a CRF must be completed and signed by 
[CONTACT_795109] [INVESTIGATOR_11637]-Investigator within a reasonable time period after data 
collection.  This also applies to records for those participants who fail to complete the study 
(even during a pre- randomization screening period if a CRF was initiated).  If a participant 
withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a participant is withdrawn 
from the study because of a treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made 
to clearly document the outcome. 
9.1.6. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountabili ty of administered  study drug (ropi[INVESTIGATOR_795025]). This includes participant 
dispensing records. The intervention CRF will document quantities administer ed to participants , 
including lot number, date dispensed, participant identifier number, participan t initials, and the 
initials of the person administering the medication.  
All drug-associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_280019]. 
Protocol SGB -[ADDRESS_1096777] been met: 
• the results of the study in their entirety have been publicly disclosed by [CONTACT_795110], manuscript, or presentation form; or 
• the study has been completed at all study sites for at least 2 years. 
No such communication, presentation, or publication will include confidential information 
(see Section  9.1.4
).  
The Investigator will submit for RTI approval any proposed publication or presentation 
along with the respective scientific journal or presentation forum at least 30 days prior to submission of the publication or presentation. The Investigator will comply with  RTI 
International’s request to delete references to its confidential information (other than the study results) in any paper or presentation. All publications will follow appropriate industry guidelines for determining authorship. 
9.3. Joint Investigator/Spons or Responsibilities  
9.3.1. Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice 
(ICH -GCP) guidelines, the study monitor must have direct access to the Investigator’ s source 
documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the CRFs for consistency. 
The monitor is responsible for review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, 
to verify adherence to the protocol, and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of the data 
Protocol SGB -[ADDRESS_1096778] of any inspection or audit. 
9.3.3. Study Discontinuation  
Both RTI International  and the Investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any 
time.  Should this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify 
the appropriate regulatory authority(i es) and IRBs.  In terminating the study, RTI International 
and the Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the participants ’ interests.

CONFIDENTIAL  SYNOPSIS  
Study Title: KPI-121-C-002: A Phase 2, Double-Masked, Randomized, 
Controlled Study of KPI-121 0.25% Ophthalmic Suspension 
Compared to Vehicle in Subjects with Dry Eye Disease  
Objectives:  The prima ry objective of the study is to investigate the safety 
and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
compared to vehicle in subjects who have a documented 
clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease . 
Study Population:  
 The study population will consist of subjects diagnosed with 
dry eye disease.  
Number of Subjects Up to 400 subjects who are diagnosed with dry eye disease 
will be screened.  Among those screened, approximately 150 
subjects will be randomized to KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension or vehicle.  
Investigational Product s: 
 KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension and vehicle will be 
supplied as investigational product.  
Route and Duration of 
Administration : [ADDRESS_973513] will be instilled in 
each eye four times per day (QID) for up to 28 days.  
Study Design:   
 This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double- masked , randomized, 
vehicle-controlled, parallel- group study designed to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension ver sus vehicle  in subjec ts with dry eye disease.   
 Approximately 400 subjects will be screened and up to 150 
subjects will be randomized at up to 12 centers located in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US).   
 Subjects will be randomized  to 1 of 2 study arms in an 
approximate 1:1 ratio.  The study arms are: 1) KPI-121 
0.25% ophthalmic suspension administered as 1-2 drops in 
each eye QID for up to 28 days or 2) vehicle administered as 
1-2 drops in each eye QID for up to 28 days.    
Furthermore, subjects will be assigned to a study arm based 
on the stratification of: 
• Subject’s day prior to Visit 2 (Day 1)

CONFIDENTIAL   AND 
• Study eye baseline investigator- rated bulbar 
conjunctival hyperemia score  
 
This study will include up to 6 clinic visits over 6 weeks. At Visit 1 Screening (14 ± 1 days prior to Day 1), subjects who 
meet screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will begin a 2-
week run-in period during w hich they will be treated with 1 -2 
drops of single-masked vehicle in each eye QID for 14 ± 1 
days.   
 At Visit 2,  Randomization (Day 1), subjects who continue to 
meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be eligible for 
randomization to 1 of the 2 arms of the study (i.e., KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  Following 
randomization, subjects will be instructed to return to the 
clinic to have a complete study evaluation at Study Visits  4 
and 6 (Days 15 ± 1 day and 29 ± 1 day, respectively).  
Subjec ts will further be instructed to return to the clinic for 
diary collection and in- clinic symptom assessment only at 
Visits 3 and 5 (Days 8 ± 1 day and 22 ± 1 day, respectively).  The last dose of investigational product and the final study 
visit will occur  upon completion of 28 ± [ADDRESS_973514].  Subjects will be released from the study at the end of Visit 6 (Day 29 ± 1 day). 
 Assessments in this study will include:  
• Subject- rated assessment of ocular discomfort  
  
•  
• Investigator- rated assessment of bulbar conjunctival 
hyperemia 
•  
• Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Over 7 million people in the [LOCATION_002] experience dry eye symptoms of some severity 
(DEWS Report, 2007).   Dry eye disease, also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) is 
characterized by [CONTACT_559036], including but not limited to dry eye 
sensation, foreign body sensation, irritation, burning, tearing, ocular pain, and itching.  
Patients with dry eye disease may experience significant ocul ar discomfort and reduced visual 
function, thus resulting in a decreased quality of life or work productivity1. 
 Current treatment of dry eye disease generally begins with artificial tear replacement and then 
expands to include topi[INVESTIGATOR_900]-inflammatory therapy and punctal occlusion
1.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_714731] (Restasis®) is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
prescription medication for use in patients with dry eye disease.  Restasis® is indicated to 
increase tear prod uction in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to 
ocular inflammation associated with KCS, but a significant percentage of patients experience adverse reactions to the drug, including ocular irritation upon instillation, slow ons et of 
response, and limited efficacy.   
 Inflammation has a prominent role in the development and proliferation of dry eye disease
2. 
Factors adversely affecting tear film stability and osmolarity can initiate an inflammatory 
cascade that leads to the development of a self -perpetuating inflam matory cycle2.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_714732], and are generally indicated for treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment
3.  
 
LE is an ester corticosteroid that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_714733], and has been 
reported to have fewer side effects than traditional glucocorticosteroids.  LE was approved by 
[CONTACT_13229] 1998 under N ew Drug A pplication (NDA) 20-583 (Lotemax®; Bausch & Lomb). 
Lotemax has gained wide acceptance by [CONTACT_714745].  
 
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KPI) has developed an improved formulation of LE, designated 
KPI-121, using a proprietary technology known as Mucus Penetrating Particles (MPP). MPP 
technology utilizes submicron drug particles formulated to enhance penetration through the mucous layer of the t ear film. KPI-[ADDRESS_973536] shown improved pharmacokinetics for KPI- 121 compared to 
Lotemax, with prolonged drug presence on the ocular surface and increased drug penetration 
into ocular tissues. This improved pharmacokinetic profile has the potential to reduce dosing 
strength of LE as compared to Lotemax.

Kala  Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  intends to develop KPI-121 for the treatment of dry eye disease.  
Study KPI-121-C-002 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension in subjects with dry eye disease.  Additional information about KPI-121, including 
nonclinical pharmacology study results, and potential risks and benefits to human subjects, 
are found in the Investigator’s Brochure.    
 
1.1. DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension contains submicron particles of LE suspended in a 
formulation consisting of  excipi[INVESTIGATOR_559031]-approved ophthalmic 
products.  Kala  is developi[INVESTIGATOR_714734].  
 
KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension contains 0.25% (w/v) LE in an isotonic formulation 
that is buffered to maintain pH 5.0 – 7.0.  It is a sterile, aqueous submicron suspension of LE 
and is filled in a white, low -density polyethylene plastic dropper bottle with a white, 
controlled -drop polyethylene tip and a polypropylene cap. Each bottle contains 5.5 mL 
nominal fill volume.  
 The vehicle control has the same composition as KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension but 
does not contain LE.  The vehicle is  essentially isotonic and is buffered to maintain pH 5.0 – 
7.0.  It is a sterile, aqueous solution supplied in the same white, low-density polyethylene plastic dropper bottle with the same white , controlled-drop polyethylene tip and white 
polypropylene closure as KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension.

USTIFICATION FOR ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSE SELECTION  
 KPI-121 will be administered as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_409458].  Subjects are expected to 
self-administer 1 to 2 drops of either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle QID. 
 Direct instillation is the most efficient method for delivery to  the ocular surface and is an 
accepted and widely used method for topi[INVESTIGATOR_558664]. This study will examine 
safety and efficacy of KPI -121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension versus vehicle dosed  QID for 28 
days in subjects with dry eye disease.

ESCRIPTION OF TRIAL DESIGN  
 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group 
study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
in treating the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.   
 
This study will include up to [ADDRESS_973541] dosing (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic 
suspension or vehicle).   
 Up to 400 subjects at up to 12 centers located in the [LOCATION_002] (US) will be screened at 
Visit 1 (Screening).  Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at this visit will enter a 14 -day run-in 
period of QID dosing with single masked vehicle.  At Visit 2 (Day 1/Randomization), 
approximately 150 subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in an 
approximate 1:1 ratio to either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle dosed QID.    The study eye will be selected based on the study qualification criteria entered into the 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) for stratification at ran domization. If both eyes 
qualify for the study with exactly the same values for ocular entry criteria, IWRS will choose 
the study eye as OD.  Other randomization and stratification allocation criteria will be applied 
as elaborated in the data management plan .  Randomization numbers will be automatically 
assigned to each subject as they are entered into the IWRS, based on the following 2 stratification criteria:  
 
• Subject’s day prior to Visit 2 (Day 1)  score  
 AND  
• Study eye baseline  bulbar conjunctival hyperemia score  
 
The IWRS will assign masked study kit numbers. Bottles of investigational product will be 
dispensed at designated visits based on the subject’s randomization. The Sponsor, 

CLINICAL PROTOCOL KPI- 121-C- 002  FINAL   PAGE 31 OF 80 
26 SEP 2014 
CONFIDENTIAL  Investigators, and study staff will be masked during the randomization process and through 
the remainder of the study.   
 
Subjects will return to the clinic for complete study evaluation at Visits 4 and 6 (Day 15 ± 1 day and Day 29 ± 1 day, respectively).   Subject will also return at Visits 3 and 5 (Days 8 ± 1 
day and 22 ± 1 day, respectively) to  
 assess concomitant medication use and adverse events.  Subjects will 
disco ntinue dosing and be released from the study at Visit 6 (Day 29 ± 1 day).  
 A summary of events is provided in 
Appendix 1 .  Assessments in this study will include:  
 
• Subject- rated ocular discomfort assessment ( Appendix 2 ) 
•  assessment ( Appendix 3 ) 
• Investigator- rated assessment of bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ( Appendix 4 ) 
• Unanesthetized Schirmer Test ( Appendix 5 )

labels will contain  the following information: sponsor name, protocol number, randomization 
number, storage temperature, and required statement(s) per the appropriate regulato ry agency.  
 
All investigational products w ill be stored in a secure area with limited access at controlled 
room temperature (15- 25°C/59 -77° F).  Subjects will be instructed to shake the investigational 
product bottle prior to administering each dose. At Visits [ADDRESS_973542] dose in the clinic, that dose will count as 1 of their 4 (QID) daily doses. Subjects will 
then self-administer [ADDRESS_973543] during the remainder of that day to complete QID dosing.  All visits should be scheduled in the morning to allow subjects to receive a full day QID dosing. 
 
Subjects will be asked to instill 1 dose upon awakening and then 3 subsequent doses 
approximately 4 hours after their previous dose.  The 4 doses will be described as “Morning 
Dose ,” “Mid -Morning Dose,” “Afternoon Dose,” and “Evening Dose.”  
 
3.5.2. Methods to Minimize Bias  
 To minimize bias , investigational product  allocation (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension 
versus vehicle) will be randomized and masked to  the sponsor, subjects, and the investigative 
staff with the exception of a dosing coordinator who will be responsible for dispensing investigational product to subjects and instructing subjects regarding dosing of the investigational product.  The randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_714746]  (who is not on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and 
limited -access location separate from the study Investigator and members of the project team.

not be considered an AE. Rescued subjects experiencing an AE at the time of rescue will be followed through stabilization or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever 
comes last ).  Rescued subjects should not be withdrawn from the study, but rather followed to 
resolution of signs and symptoms or until the Investigator has deemed the subject is stable.

UBJECT WITHDRAWAL AND /OR DISCONTINUATION  
 
Any subject who wishes to may withdraw from the investigational product use or from 
participation in the study of his or her own accord for any reason is entitled to do so without 
obligation.  The Investigator may also withdraw any subject from the investigational product use or from study participation, if deemed necessary.  
 Investigational product use  may be discontinued and any subject may be discontinued from 
study par ticipation  at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator or the 
sponsor for any reason including but not limited to:  
1. Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to 
substantial risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the 
protocol. 
2. Any SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition that indicates to the Investigator that continued 
participation is not in the b est interest of the subject.  
3. Subject's decision to withdraw. 
4. Any woman who becomes pregnant while participating in the study.  Information on the pregnancy and outcome will be requested.   
5. Subject ’s failure to comply with protocol requirements or study related procedures. 
6. Termination of the study by [CONTACT_1034], FDA, or other regulatory authorities.

follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) to resolution.   The reason for premature discontinuation should 
be entered onto the Case Report Form ( CRF ) and recorded in the subject chart.  
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
 Additionally, the trial or parts of the trial may be discontinued by [CONTACT_589173], Inc.  This 
may be based on a significant number of AEs  of a similar nature that warra nt such action.

OLLECTION OF DATA 
 
Source documentation for data collected in this study will be maintained at the investigative 
site.  In cases where no source will be used   it will be no ted in the 
Investigator files.  The CRF will be electronic (eCRF) and data will be electronically entered 
from the source documentation into  the eCRF .  After study completio n, an archival  copy [e.g., 
Portable Document Format (PDF)] of the eCRF data will be retained by [CONTACT_779]. 

CLINICAL PROTOCOL KPI- 121-C- [ADDRESS_973563] (vehicle).  Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria at Visit 2 
will be randomized to either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle.  One kit of 
randomized investigational product containing [ADDRESS_973564] at Visit 2.  At Visit 2 (Day 1/Randomization), subjects will receive [ADDRESS_973565] (KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  At Visit 4 (Day 15 ± 1 day), subjects will receive [ADDRESS_973566] from the kit allocated.  All bottles will be returned to the site at Visit 6 
(Day 29 ± 1 day).  The investigational product will be stored at the site in a secure area with 
limited access at controlled room temperature (15 -25°C/59 -77°F). 
 Subjects will be asked to  administer investigational product QID.  Prior to each instillation, 
subject will be instructed to shake investigational product bottle.  The subjects will record the 
time of ad ministration of each dose of investigational product at the time of instillation 
(
Appendix 12 ).  Compliance with instillation of investigational product will be reviewed and 
assessed at each clinic visit.

Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_714748] .  The site will document this 
comparison along with verification of the numbers of used and unused investigational product 
bottles. The numbers of missed doses as assessed at each clinic visit should be documented in 
the eCRF.   
 
6.4. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Sponsor study monitors or designees will conduct accountability of investigational product 
(KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle).  Accountability will be ascertained by

area limited  to controlled access.  
 At the end of the study, all study materials, including any unused investigational product s 
(KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or vehicle), as well as original containers (even if 
empty), will be returned to the drug-packaging vendor in accordance with sponsor or 
designee’s S tandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) , following approval by [CONTACT_1034]. All 
returns of investigational product will be documented.  The study monitor or designee will 
verify drug accountability.  All drug accounting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete.  
 
6.5. M
AINTENANCE OF RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURE FOR BREAKING THE CODE 
 
The sponsor, the project teams at the designated Contract Research Organizations ( CROs ), 
and investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to 
investigational product assignments.  A dosing coordinator, who is not responsible for study 
assessments, will be required to dispense and retrieve investigational product to the subjects. In case of medical emergency, or occurrence of an SAE, the r andomization code may be 
unmasked and made available to the Investigator, sponsor, and/or other personnel involved in 
the monitoring or conduct of this study.  In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the study is completed and the 
database is locked.   
 
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed.  Since there 
is no specific antidote to KPI-121, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary.  If the 
Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency 
situation, the Investigator may call the medical monitor and notify the sponsor.  The 
investigational product assignment will be revealed on a subject -by-subject  basis with the 
approval of the medical monitor and sponsor, thus leaving the masking of the remaining subject s intact.

Safety parameters include:  
• Assessments of AEs  
• BCVA  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
• Dilated o phthalmoscopy  
• IOP measurement  
 
8.2. ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event  (AE) :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes 
of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
 
Unexpected:   An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s B rochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator’s B rochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the cu rrent 
application.   
Life-threatening:  An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
 
  
CLINICAL PROTOCOL KPI- 121-C- 002  FINAL   PAGE 52 OF 80 
26 SEP 2014 
CONFIDENTIAL  A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring 
at any dose that:  
 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
 
A NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE  that does not meet the definitions for 
SAE s as described above.  
 Each  AE will be classified as SERIOUS  or NON- SERIOUS using the definitions provided 
above.  The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use of 
investigational product (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE  will be 
assessed using the following definitions : 
 Unrelated :  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational product use. 
 
Unlike ly:  
• Poor temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Event easily explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Possible:  
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
 Event could be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 Probable:  
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.

• Distinct temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_25046]. 
• Event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_220248] t’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
8.3. P
ROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY [CONTACT_589178], date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of investigational product ), treatment required , and the outcome.   
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as 
the initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial.  For example:  
• How have you felt since your last assessment? 
• Have you had any health problems since your last assessment?
 
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
 The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_1268]  [INVESTIGATOR_202333], 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite.  
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
If a non- SAE  is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to 
follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow 
SAE s to resolu tion. 
 
8.4. S
ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING BY [CONTACT_714750] a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or their staffs ’ attention.  It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to report all SAEs 
reported at their site to their Institutional Review Board (IRB), as required.  The Investigator

• Remove the right eye strip from the sheath. 
• Ask the subject to look up and gently draw the right lower lid in a downward and temporal direction. 
 
• Place the rounded end of the strip toward the temporal one-third of the lower eyelid.  
• Repeat this procedure in the left eye. 
• Darken the room, but ensure that the Large E or the ETDRS chart is visible. 
• Instruct the subject to relax and look at the chart while blinking normally or have subject gently close eyes.
 
• Strips are removed after 5 minutes. 
• After removing the strips, with a sharp pencil draw a horizontal line across the leading edge of moisture and a second horizontal line across the lowest point of moisture.
 
• Using a ruler and/or the millimeters recorded on the strips, measure a point halfway

 APPENDIX 6: BEST-CORRECTED VISUAL ACUITY  
 
BCVA will be conducted at Visits 1, 2, [ADDRESS_973582]’s own corrective lenses (spectacles only) or pi[INVESTIGATOR_558670].  
 
An ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart may be used.  If a Lighthouse chart is used (24.5” by 
25”; either reflectance or retro -illuminated), the subject must view the chart from a distance of 
exactly 4 meters (13.1 feet).  If smaller reproductions (18” by 18”, e.g., Prevent Blindness) are 
used, the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet.  Reflectance wall charts should 
be frontally illuminated (60 watt bulb or a well -lit room).  
 
The subject should be positioned according to the elevation of the chart (either seated or 
standing) so that the c hart is at a comfortable viewing angle.  The right eye should be tested 
first.  The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with 
line [ADDRESS_973583] identification of 
each letter.  He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite 
response.  If the subject changes a response before he has read aloud the next letter, then the 
change must be accepted.  
 
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart encouraging the subject to 
guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, the 
examiner should stop the test.  The number of letters missed or read incorrect ly should be 
noted. 
 
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during 
the study, consistently use the same lighting conditions during the entire study.  
 
Calculations : logMAR VA = Baseline value + (n X 0.02) 
where:  the baseline value is the logMAR number of the last line read (at least 1 letter 
read correctly in this line), and 
“n” is the total number of letters missed up to and including the last line read, and
  
“0.02” is the value for each letter

 APPENDIX 9: LISSAMINE  GREEN CONJUNCTIVAL STAINING  
 
Lissamine Green staining will be performed at Visit 1, 2, 4, and 6.   
 
The conjunctiva will be stained with non-preserved, 1% lissamine green. When conducting all assessments room temperature and humidity should be relatively consistent throughout each 
visit and throughout the study.  
 
• Without flushing the eye from the previous assessment, instill a 20 µ l drop of lissamine 
green to the right eye using a micropi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], allowing a drop to form. 
• Gently touch the drop at the tip of the delivery dropper to the lower palpebral 
conjunctiva of the right eye.    
• In order to thoroughly coat the ocular surface with the lissamine, ask the subject to blink several times and move his/her eye around. 
• After [ADDRESS_973584] elapsed, using white light of moderate 
intensity , grade the areas of the conjunctiva of the right eye with the 0- 3 scale shown 
below. 
• Staining induced by [CONTACT_714754].

 APPENDIX 11: DILATED OPHTHALMOSCOPY   
 
Dilated ophthalmoscopy will include assessment of the optic nerve head for pallor and 
cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (cup to disc ratio), and will be performed at Visit 1 and Visit 6 after to administration 
of all  other study assessments (except for symptom assessments).  After  the ophthalmoscopy 
procedure, the Investigator will determine if findings are within normal limits or are 
abnormal.  For abnormal findings at Visit 1, the Investigator will determine whether or not the 
abnormality would exclude subject from study participation.

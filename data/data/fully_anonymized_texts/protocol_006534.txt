John Eaton, PI   [CONTACT_242953]  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be carried out in accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002]  government regulations and Mayo Clinic  research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, fibro- inflammatory, cholestatic liver disease 
affecting  approximately 25,000 adolescents and adults in the [LOCATION_002] and a major 
indication for liver transplantation (LT) .
1-[ADDRESS_501694] risk factor for CCA, and carries a median LT -free survival of only 12 years.4-7  The 
etiopathogenesis of PSC is unknown, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_398276] n early 20 different 
immunosuppressants and other agents, safe and effective pharmacotherapy has yet to be established .
2  Unlike in other cholestatic liver diseases (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis), treatment 
with ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA) has not been clearly shown to have a beneficial effect in 
PSC.  In addition, high doses of UDCA have been associated with sig nificantly greater adverse 
outcomes.  Although operative treatment with liver transplantation (LT) is effective for PSC, it is available in limited specialty centers and only an option in select patients; even in suitable LT candidates, however, PSC and CC A can recur post -LT.
8-10  Therefore, given the morbidity and 
mortality of PSC and the challenges associated with operative treatment, safe and effective pharmacotherapy is critically needed.  Furthermore, the negative results of previous clinical trials highlight the need to consider targeting alternative pathophysiologic pathways.  
 Curcumin, the principal curcuminoid of the rhizome turmeric  (Curcuma longa) , is a naturally 
occurring compound with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, among other potentially 
therapeutic effects .
11-16  In a recent study of the mdr2 knockout murine model of PSC, it was 
shown that as little as 4 weeks of oral curc umin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in 
serum liver enzymes as well as histologic disease, including sclerosing cholangitis, ductular proliferation, and fibrosis, all of which are pathologic hallmarks of PSC.
17, 18  Furthermore, 
curcumin has been shown to decrease cholangiocyte  (i.e. biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231]) reactivity as well 
as hepatic myofibroblast activation  (i.e. pro -fibrogenic function), both of which are key 
phenomena in the pathogenesis of PSC.17, [ADDRESS_501695] 
therapy for patients with PSC.  
1.2 Investigational Agent 
 Curcumin is an orange-red powder that is a mixture of 3 compounds— curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemothyxcurcumin.    Forty  to eighty- five percent of an oral dose of curcumin passes through the gastrointestinal tract 
unchanged.  T he bioavailability of curcumi n is greatest in the colon.  Hexahydrocurcuminol i s 
the major biotransformed metabolite of curcumin.  The major biliary metabolites are tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin.

John Eaton, PI   [INVESTIGATOR_398277] a growing number of in vitro  and in vivo  studies to demonstrate 
biological activity with a variety of potentially medicinal applications, e.g. anti-inflammatory , 
anti-oxidant, and chemopreventive (i.e. anti- cancer) .11-[ADDRESS_501696] been facilitated  by [CONTACT_398293], particularly the mdr2 
knockout mouse.
19, 20  Indeed, recent experimental evidence from this model has demonstrated 
that as little as 4 weeks of treatment with the naturally -occurring compound curcumin results in a 
significant reduction of serum liver enzymes as well as histologic disease, including sclerosing cholangitis, ductular proliferation, and fibrosis (i.e. pathologic hallm arks of PSC).
17  In addition 
to the promising mdr2 knockout mouse model data, curcumin has been shown in vitro  to 
decrease insult -induced human cholangiocyte reactivity (a characteristic feature in PSC 
cholangiocytes),2, 17, [ADDRESS_501697] activation (manifested classically in PSC 
as peri -ductal “onionskin” fibrosis ),17, 22 and suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of 
human CCA cells (which could serve a vital chemopreventive role in PSC patients).2, 23, [ADDRESS_501698] been implicated in the pathogenesis 
of PSC, and indeed 70% of patients with PSC have inflammatory bowel disease, a disorder associated with enteric microbial dysbiosis.

increase in ALK or lactate dehydrogenase. ) 
  
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective: to determine the change in serum Alkaline Phosphatase following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment as a biomarker of therapeutic efficacy .   
 Secondary Objective: to determine: 1) change in serum AST, total bilirubin, albumin, C -reactive 
protein, and Mayo PSC risk score following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment compared to baseline values  as markers of biochemical improvement; 2) change in s elf-reported  health status, 
fatigue severity, and pruritus (as assessed by [CONTACT_398294]) following 12 weeks of treatment comp ared to baseline values  as markers of symptomatic improvement, and 3) the 
adverse events occurring during [ADDRESS_501703] an open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_398278].  Fifteen  patients with PSC will receive one 750 mg 
CuraMed® softgel (EuroPharma, Inc.) by [CONTACT_326372] a day for 12 weeks.  Of note, each 750 mg C uraMed® softgel supplies [ADDRESS_501704] will be performed on female patients  of 
child bearing potential .  Standardized questionnaires regarding health status (SF -36 Health 
Survey and Chronic Liver Disease Que stionnaires), fatigue (Fisk Fatigue Impact Scale) and 
pruritus (5 -D Pruritus scale) will be completed by [CONTACT_398295] 12 weeks.  
Phone calls will be made to participants weekly during the study, at completion of the study (i.e. at 12 weeks of therapy)  and/or early termination, and at two weeks after completion of the study 
to monitor for any adverse events or effects of the study drug .  Study staff will specifically 
inquire about local and systemic adverse effects including gastrointestin al upset, nausea, 
diarrhea , signs of anemia (e.g., weakness, fatigue) , and rash; during weekly phone or in person

3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
 
The primary study endpoint in this study will be treatment success, as determined by  [CONTACT_398296], as defined by: 1) a ≥40% reduction  in serum Alkaline Phosphatase (as compared to 
baseline value)
37 or  2) a decreas e in serum Alkaline Phosphatase to less than 1.[ADDRESS_501706] is an  important endpoint 
and biomarker in studies of patients with PSC.  
 
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include  change in : 1) serum AST, total bilirubin, albumin, C -
reactive protein, and Mayo PSC risk score42 following 12 weeks of curcumin treatment compared 
to baseline values  as markers of biochemical improvement and  2) change in s elf-reported  health 
status, fatigue severity, and pruritus (as assessed by [CONTACT_398294]) following 12 weeks of treatment compared to baseline values  as markers of symptomatic improvement.  
 
3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints

7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
Approximately 5% of patients with PSC and chronically (>6 months) elevated ALK will 
spontaneously experience either a clinically significant reduction in serum ALK to less ≤ 1.5 
times the upper limit of normal38 or a reductio n of > 40% of the baseline ALK value .37  In this 
open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], our  prim ary objective is to determine the proportion of patients who 
experience curcumin treatment success, as defined by [CONTACT_398307].  Notably ; these patients are hereinafter consider ed historical controls.
[ADDRESS_501714] 30% of curcumin treated patients, i.e. a rate that is at least 25% more than the conservative estimate in historical controls, likely based on pre -clinical data, and 
clinically promising, this would encourage further study of curcumin in larger, randomized 
clinical trials in patients with PSC.   
  
By [CONTACT_79323] [ADDRESS_501715] with a nominal two -sided 
significance level of α=0.[ADDRESS_501716] approximately 90% power to detect a 25% difference in 
clinically significant ALK improvement between the null hypothesis of 5% (historical control) and the alternative hypothesis of  30%.  In addition, if 6 of 20 PSC patients (30%) experience 
treatment success, the 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) would be 11.9% to 54.3%, suggesting that the sample size has adequate precision to not include the null hypothesis (5%) in the C I. 
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated, as appropriate , for 
all variables.  Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and secondary) will be tabulated.  These analyses will help identify potential confounding variables to be used as covariates in advanced statistical (e.g. multivariate) analyses.  Bonferroni correction will be used to adjust p-values in the case of multiple comparisons.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Adverse e vents and study discontinuat ion 
 
Patients will be discontinued from the study if they: 1) request withdrawal from the study, 2) develop worsening of underlying liver function defined as doubling of serum total bilirubin and/or increase in ALK or AST to ≥ 3x the upper limit of normal or baseline levels  without 
mechanical biliary obstruction, 3) have side effects to study drug (e.g. diarrhea) that are not 
controlled by [CONTACT_398308] (e.g. loperamide), or 4) experience an adverse event based on CTCAE 4.[ADDRESS_501718] the study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log.  The inve stigators will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and 
reporting required (see next section).  
 
8.1.1 Investigator reporting  
 
The investigator s will personally supervise the study.  An adverse event is defined as any 
unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with use of the study medication, whether or not related to the medication.  Worsening of the pre -existing 
clinical condition will be considered an adverse event and, possibly, treatment failure.    T he investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug: 
 
1. Probably related:  Adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study drug or recurs on 
re-challenge and another etiolo gy is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
2. Possibly related:  Adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug and an 
alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to study drug. 
3. Probably not related:  Adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the study drug 
and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
4. Not related:  Adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another 
drug and is not related to the study drug (e.g., has no temporal relationship to study drug or has a much more likely alternative etiology).  
  Adverse events will be classified according to severity into: mild (transient and easily 
tolerated by [CONTACT_2299]), moderate (causes t he participant discomfort and interrupts the

John Eaton, PI   [INVESTIGATOR_398288]’s usual activities), or severe (causes considerable interference with the participant’s 
usual activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening).  A serious adverse event is defined 
as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life- threatening, requires or prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372], represents other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to research participants.  
 
 The investigators will be responsible for communicating adverse events to the Mayo 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, Co-investigators, and 
the Food and Drug Administration.  The following information will be recorded in the study database and provided as indicated: 
 
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research (drug, procedure, or intervention):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity scale 1 -5) 
• If any intervention was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was th e incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment) 
• Date of Resolution:  
 
8.1.2 Investigator reporting: Notifying the FDA 
 The investigators will report to the FDA all unexpected, serious suspected adverse reactions according to the required IND  Safety Reporting timelines, formats and requirements . 
 Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be 
reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the i nvestigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those listed in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
Curcumin pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]   1/3/2018, V ersion [ADDRESS_501719] a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the drug will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the investigators initial receipt of the information about the event.  
 
8.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_398289] e participants develop an adverse event based on 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria of grade 3 or higher OR if one patient develops an adverse event based on CTCAE 4.0 criteria of grade 4 or higher that is not related to th e participant’s underlying disease.  
 
8.3 Medical Monitoring  
 
It is the responsibility of the principle investigators to oversee the safety of the study at their  site.  
This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing , and Inspecting” ).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.

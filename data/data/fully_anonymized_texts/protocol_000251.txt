Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 3 of 15 1.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The Hydrus Aqueous Implant is a crescent -shaped implantable device pre -loaded onto a  
hand- held delivery system.  The Implant is delivered into Schlemm's canal by [CONTACT_178572].  Once the implant is in position, the central core wir e of the 
delivery system is retracted, allowing complete detachment of the Hydrus Aqueous Implant.  Upon implantation, the crescent -shaped device provides a support structure, 
serving to dilate and restore the natural aqueous outflow pathway through Schlem m's 
canal, leading to a reduction of intraocular pressure. 
The Hydrus Aqueous Implant is composed of nitinol, a metal alloy composed of nearly 
equal parts of nickel (Ni) and titanium (Ti).   Nitinol has been used extensively in a 
variety of implantable vascular and orthopedic devices for its proven properties of flexibility, strength and biocompatibility.  As a shape memory alloy, nitinol has super elastic properties making it suitable as a support structure in Schlemm's canal.  Its 
flexibility and small size allow delivery of the Hydrus  through torturous, restrictive 
passages with minimal force.  The Hydrus  Aqueous Implant is illustrated in Figure 1, on 
the following page .

2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE  AND DESIGN  
The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of one Hydrus to two iStents  for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with mild -to-moderate primary 
open angle glaucoma (POAG) , pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PXG), or pi[INVESTIGATOR_178564] (PG) . 
 
This study is a prospective, multicenter, single masked, randomized, clinical trial in which a total of 160 subjects ( 80 per study arm) will be treated  with either one Hydrus or 
two iStents  for treatment of POAG , PXG, or PG  in subjects with a phakic  lens.  The 
study will be conducted according the Declaration of Helsinki.  All study subjects must sign the Informed Consent prior to initiating participation in the study.  
 
Key inclusion criteria for this study are a diagnosis of POAG , PXG, or PG  based on optic 
nerve neuropathy, an open angle, and elevated IOP  of 23- [ADDRESS_209880] of medications on 
the IOP -reducing ability of the devices, a "wash -out" of all glaucoma medications will be 
conducted, and a ‘diurnal’ methodology will be utilized to determine the subject’s 
eligibility .  The duration of wash- out will be determined by [CONTACT_178573](s) 
used. 
 
Upon successfully meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects will be 
scheduled for surgery.  Randomization will take place on the day of surgery just prior to treatment.  Randomization sequence will be based on pre -determined computer -generated 
lists. 
 
   
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page [ADDRESS_209881] 's IOP, ocular health, and visual acuity status.  Visits will be conducted at 1, 7, 30, 
180, 365, 540, and [ADDRESS_209882] does  not respond to device therapy, h ypotensive  glaucoma 
medications may be prescribed in order t o reduce IOP to a safe level, as determined by 
[CONTACT_178574].  Medications of the same type used prior to wash out will be re -started in this event.  Re -medication will not be considered an adverse 
event, but will be monitored.  Neither the Hydrus nor the iStent devices preclude the ability to later perform filtration surgery, in the event medications do not lower pressure adequately  and more invasive therapy is required.  
 
3.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS

 6.6 Study Visits  and Examination Schedule  
All subjects will participate in defined follow -up visits through 24 months.  A Case 
Report Form (CRF) shall be completed for each scheduled exam.  Unscheduled or interim visits should also be recorded using the appropriate CRF.  
 
The procedures associated with each study visit are outlined and summarized in Appendix 1 (Schedule of Events and Procedures).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_209892] has a complaint regarding the study eye and/or treatment to the study eye is required or changed will be documented as an unscheduled visit .  The Investigator and/or 
qualified invest igational staff will perform the procedures necessary to evaluate the study 
participant at these visits, and will record the visit in the subject’s chart and on an interim CRF.  No specific testing is required at interim visit.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_209893] -operative period (0 -60 days) should be 
selected from the beta blocker class  (if tolerated) as indicated in the table below .  In these 
cases, additional visits may be p erformed to assess IOP, and medications discontinued if 
the patient’s  IOP allows . 
 
Long term medical therapy (defined as medications prescribed at or after the 90 -day visit) 
may be implemented at the Investigator’s discretion in order to maintain a safe IOP. 
 Patient medication usage (medication class, dose, frequency, and brand, if applicable) will be collected at the time of screening.  The medications should be assigned a  rank 
order for the purpose of potential reintroduction.  If post -operative IOP incr eases to an 
unsafe level , ocular hypotensive medications should be reintroduced one at a tim e and 
following the order indicated at screening.  
 If a medication prescribed in the immediate post- operative period does not match the 
class indicated on the screening list and is continued to the [ADDRESS_209894] should be switched to the pre -surgical medication class and dose if possible. 
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page [ADDRESS_209895] Disposition  
Subjects may be terminated (exited) from the study early due to:  
 
• Screen ing failure , 
• A threat to the subject’s health emerges in the course of following study procedures,  
• Inability to continue with the study, and  
• Voluntar y withdrawal.  
 
Subjects who are terminated due to screening  failure will not be followed beyond the date 
of screen ing failure.  For safety reasons, randomized subjects who are terminated should 
receive routine clinical follow up until the planned end of  the study period.  CRF’s will 
not be completed for terminated subjects.  Terminated subjects will not be replaced.  Notification of a subject’s early termination should be made immediately to the sponsor and documented on the appropriate CRF.  
 Completed subjects are those subjects who have not been terminated from the study  prior 
to completion of follow up. 
 7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
All ocular adverse events (AE)  in the study eye must be reported on the adverse event 
CRF.  The Investigator must categorize each AE by [CONTACT_178582] (mild, moderate, or severe), and the relationship to study device and implantation procedure (not related, possibly, probably, or definitely).  Since there are no aspects of the study that can affect both eyes, only serious adverse events observed in the fellow eye will be captured on the case report form throughout the course of the study.  
 Ocular conditions or diseases that are chronic bu t stable and meet the inclusion and 
exclusion  criteria should be recorded on the screening CRF under Ocular History.  
Changes in any chronic condition or disease that are consistent with natural disease progression are not considered AEs a nd will not be recorded on an AE CRF.

• Endophthalmitis  
• Persistent hyphema of >2 mm present > 1 week  postoperative  
• Corneal opacification  
• Corneal decompensation  
• Corneal edema persisting >1 month (mild to moderate corneal edema prior to 1 month postoperative is not considered an adverse event)  
• Retinal complications (flap tears, retinal detachment, or proliferative vitreoretinopathy)  
• IOP spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (e levated mean IOP ≥10 mmHg above the qualifying baseline mean IOP 
more than  1 month postoperative ) 
• Events resulting in an unplanned ocular surgical re -intervention (other than 
paracentesis to relieve pressure prior to 1 week postoperative)  
• Phthisis  
• Significant foreign body sensation at or after 3 months postoperative

postoperative, not associated with a pre -existing condition  
• A 2-point worsening to severe on the slit lamp examination findings (other than cells 
and flare) at or after 3 months postoperative not associated with a pre -existing 
condition 
• A 2-point worsening of ocular symptoms to severe or very severe at or after 3 months 
postoperative not associated with a pre -existing condition  
 
7.4 Recording and Reporting Adverse Ev ents 
To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Investigators should observe the following guidelines:  
 
• Whenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording AEs on the AE 
CRF.  Do not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations. 
• For the purposes of reporting infection/inflammation, the following terms and 
definitions should be used:  
 
Iritis:  Presence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, with or 
without anterior vitreous inflammation.   
• The presence of aqueous flare alone will not be considered 
to constitute iritis.  
• For the purposes of this protocol, the term "iritis" will 
encompass b oth cases of iritis without anterior vitreous 
inflammation (iritis) and those with anterior vitreous 
inflammation (iridocyclitis).  
 
Iridocyclitis : Presence of inflammatory cells in both the aqueous and vitreous.  
 
Vitritis :   Presence of active inflammation in the vitreous, as demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_178583] (trace or greater) involving the 
mid-vitreous cavity.  
• The presence of inflammation involving only the anterior 
vitreous will not be considered to constit ute vitritis because 
it may result from iridocyclitis (see above).  
• Active inflammation in the vitreous should be clinically 
differentiated from cellular debris from prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_178571], hemorrhage, or other causes.  
• The presence of vitreous flare  alone in the absence of active 
inflammatory cells will not be considered to constitute 
vitritis.  
Endophthalmitis : Diffuse intraocular inflammation predominantly involving the 
vitreous cavity but also involving the anterior chamber, implying a 
suspected underlying infectious cause, if known; record the 
diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component signs 
and symptoms on AE pages of the CRF.  
 
 
Ivantis, Inc.  
Protocol [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 14 of 15 7.5 Grading of AEs  
AEs are to be graded on a three- point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in detail 
on the appropriate AE CRF.  The definitions are as follows:  
 
• Mild:  Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate:   Discomfo rt sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• Severe:   Incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activity , and any 
event  resulting in death or  requiring rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 
7.[ADDRESS_209896] (UADE) means any serious adverse effect (as 
defined above) on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 Any UADE must be reported in writing  to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of 
that event.  The Spons or wil l be responsible for informing regulatory a uthorities and all 
other Medical Ethics Committees/ IRBs and Investigators participating in the study of the 
UADE.

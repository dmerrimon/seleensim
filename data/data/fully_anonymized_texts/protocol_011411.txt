Confidentia l and Proprietary  Page [ADDRESS_287032] been increasing due to high demand for tattoos especially among teens and younger adults.  As a result of this high demand, tattoo removal has become a common cosm etic procedure [1]. 
 Tattoos are exogenous (foreign) pi[INVESTIGATOR_237115].  They vary in size, composition and dermal depth. There are five types of tattoos: professional, amateur, cosmetic, traumatic, and medical [2-5].  Tattoos  are created using a variety of pi[INVESTIGATOR_237116]/or combinations 
comprised of inorganic and/or organic compounds, such as chromium, mercury, iron, copper, carbon and polycyclic compounds [6].   
 The non -selective tattoo removal mainly consists of the mechanical, suc h as salabrasion, and excision; 
chemical, such as trichloroacetic acid; and thermal methods such as electrocautery, cryotherapy, and continuous wave laser therapy [4].  These invasive methods vary in effectiveness and always result in 
scarring and dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371].  
 
Recent technology involves the use of pulsed lasers, namely q- switched or quality -switched (QS) lasers 
which produce nanosecond laser pulses by [CONTACT_237139]- state energy from the 
laser medium. This concept is based on the principle of selective photothermolysis which imply (1) the use of the wavelength matching the absorption spectra of the tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_81847] (2) the delivery of the heat to target pi[INVESTIGATOR_237117].  This allows selective destruction of target chromophore in the skin without damage to the surro unding tissue.  
 Currently, there are four different types of nanosecond QS lasers widely used for tattoo removal: 532 nm (Nd:YAG), 1064 nm (Nd:YAG), 755 nm (Alexandrite) and 694 nm (Ruby) wavelengths.  1064 nm (Nd:YAG) and 755 nm (Alexandrite) wavelengths are used for black and blue tattoos, 694 nm (Ruby) wavelength for blue, black and green tattoos; 532 nm (Nd:YAG) wavelength for red tattoos. Besides tattoo color, tattoo type, tattoo age, tattoo location, patient age, and patient skin type are also part of considerations for the 
selection of optimal laser(s) and parameters in each patient. Depending on the composition of colors used 
in tattoos, more than one laser may be used.   
 
To date, nanosecond QS lasers have been successfully used and found to be safe  and effective for tattoo 
removal [7-18]. Transient or permanent hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_237118], 
such as 532 nm (Nd:YAG) 755 nm (Alexandrite) and 694 nm (Ruby) as they compete with the melanin in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Thus, shorter wavelengths are not recommended for treatments in darker skin types. Longer wavelength 1064 nm (Nd:YAG), on the other hand, is considered to be safe in darker skin types because of decreased melanin absorption. Still, lower fluences are recommended for treatment of darker

is no longer the target chromophore.  
 There are  some challenges associated with tattoo removal. If mixtures of pi[INVESTIGATOR_237116]/or multicolors are 
used, a complete clearing of the tattoo may not be achieved with lasers [19].  Different colors are usually 
mixed to achieve various levels of brightness and lightness. Another contributing factor to unsuccessful outcome is that most tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_237119].  When the exact compound of the tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_237120], paradoxical darkening of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_237121], which may be difficult to remove [20-23].  Addition ally, 
white, orange, yellow and brown tattoo inks are particularly difficult to treat [24]. 
 
Although the mechanism of action is not clearly understood, the effects of the lasers on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_237122]: 1) photothermal/photochemical and 2) photoacoustic/photomechanical [25, 26].  
Conversion of absorbed energy into heat (photothermal effect) breaks the chemical bonds inside the pi[INVESTIGATOR_237123].  At the same time, the ultrashort he ating of the particle shell 
may cause heating of the surrounding tissue via rapid thermal expansion resulting in shock waves. These shock waves may help destroy the surrounding cellular structures and tattooed compounds mechanically (photoacoustic/photomec hanical). The resultant fragmented particles are then removed by [CONTACT_237140]: 1) transepi[INVESTIGATOR_237124], 2) removal via lymphatics, and 3) rephagocytosis by [CONTACT_237141] (inflammatory or resident cells) in the dermis.  
 Histological examinations show that the tattoo pi[INVESTIGATOR_237125] a result of active phagocytosis in dermal cells, such as macrophages and fibroblasts [27, 
28]. In electron microscopy of black tattoos immediately after treatment with 1064 nm Nd:YAG, vacuoles 
were observed in the dermis [ 29].  Vacuoles were lined by [CONTACT_237142][INVESTIGATOR_2517] -containing cells, flattened 
cell nuclei and disrupted lysosomes. Cells without pi[INVESTIGATOR_237126]. 
One week after treatment, a moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the dermis and all tattoo particles were phagocytosed and intracellular within fibroblasts and macrophages. At one month post -treatment, all residual pi[INVESTIGATOR_237127].  
 Although nanosecond QS lasers are safe and effective in the treatment of tattoos, treatment sessions a re 
often painful and as many as [ADDRESS_287033] tattoo particles ranging in size from 40 to 300 nm in vivo and their thermal relaxation times being mostly in  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_237128] [30].  For example, the most common 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_237129], carbon black in india ink, which is shown to be about [ADDRESS_287034] a thermal relaxation time of 1 nanosecond [31]. In that case, a thermally confined 
disruption of the particle can only be achieved via pi[INVESTIGATOR_237130].  This suggests that energy delivery 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_237131].  Moreover, the resultant ultra -short pulses with higher peak temperatures should decrease adverse 
effects, such as dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_237132].   
 Up to date, various studies of pi[INVESTIGATOR_237133], both in vitro and in vivo, have been conducted to test the hypotheses on the potential benefits of pi[INVESTIGATOR_237133] [30-34].  In a split -tattoo study, Ross et

Safety variables will be analyzed descriptively.  
 
The safety variables for this study are:  
 
1. Subject discomfort (pain) during and after treatment (to be descri ptively displayed).  
2. Incidence and severity of adverse effects during study duration (to be displayed descriptively as counts and frequency distributions).  
Device -related and procedure -related adverse effects (AEs) and subjects who prematurely terminate from 
the study due to an adverse device effect, including the treatment- related pain ratings, as reported on 
case report forms will be tabulated and analyzed. For a given AE term, counting will be done by [CONTACT_1130], not by [CONTACT_15992], i.e. for a subject reporting the same AE more than once, the event will be counted only once, at the most severe and most -related occurrence.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
each AE Term will be descriptively summarized. Statistical hypothesis testing will not be p erformed for 
safety data.

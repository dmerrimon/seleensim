2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 BACKGROUND & STUDY RATIONALE  
Myasthenia gravis  (MG)  is an autoimmune disease  in which a ntibodies bind to acetylcholine receptors or 
at the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle weakness.[ADDRESS_306423] in treating MG and might enhance the efficacy of medications.3 
Acupuncture is a non -pharmacologic treatment that has been practiced in Chinese medicine for over 
4,000 years.4 It is a technique where fine needles are inserted into specific areas of the body to achieve  
a therapeutic benefit.4 Historically, acupuncture is based on a Chinese/East Asian medical theory that 
acupuncture restores normal function to the body by [CONTACT_252052].[ADDRESS_306424] randomized controlled trial of acupuncture treatment was published in 1975. Acupuncture has been shown to be 
safe and effective treatment for treating several chronic conditions, including patients suffering from 
headache,
5 migraine,5 and chronic pain.6 Although both minor and serious adverse events  (AEs)  have 
been reported, serious complications related to acupuncture are rare.7

Assessments/Questionnaires (MG -QOL15 &  MG ADL ) 
The Myasthenia Gravis  Quality of Life Scale  short form self -assessment (MG -QOL15)  and Activities of Daily 
Living self- assessment (MG ADL) are standardized questionnaires that will measure personal perception 
of life  and activities of daily living. The questions on these assessments may make participants  feel 
uncomfortable because some parts may be easy to answer, while some parts may be difficult or tiring. 
Filling out the questionnaires may  also cause individuals  to feel uncomfortable or upset.  
 Loss of Confidentiality  
There may be a slight possibility of breach of confidential information that was collected.  However, the 
following procedures will be implemented to reduce this risk:  
• Data collection and reporting tools will be developed and stored internally.  
• Data collected and stored electronically will remain confidential and secure (e.g. secured server 
and password protected files [REDCap]).  
• Study binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked office.  
• After the study is closed, all subject identifiers will be destroyed.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  10  
Study Design:  
This study is an unblinded, controlled randomized, 2 -arm clinical trial.  
 
Hypotheses:  
Primary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that acupuncture w ill improve the quality of life in MG patients.  
Secondary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that acupuncture will improve activities of daily living in MG 
patients . 
 
Randomization:  
Prior to the first acupuncture treatment visit, participants will be randomized into two treatment groups.  
Randomization is explained in Section 6.3. 
 
Acupuncture Treatment Groups:  
Group 1: 10 participants will receive acupuncture treatment immediately  2x per week for 12 
weeks = 24  total.  
Group 2: A fter a 12 -week delay , 10 participants will receive acupuncture treatment 2 x per week 
for 12 weeks = 24 total.  
 
Study Intervention:  
Acupuncture treatment will consist of a standardized treatment protocol designed for this study. Approximately 23 -32 needles  will be inserted into  specific areas of the body for a duration of 30 minutes. 
Additional details of the treatment are discussed in Section 6.1.  
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
 
Justification  for an unblinded study:  Because it will be clear to both study personnel and participants who 
will have a delayed start and who will start immediately, neither will be blinded in this study. This will be reported as a limitation of the study.  
 
Justification for an uncontrolled study  with no control group : N/A 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
 Acupuncture is a treatment that has been practiced for over 4,000 years and is well- accepted by [CONTACT_252053]. Although the mechanism is not well understood, acupuncture has been shown to  be safe and 
effective for treating several conditions (e.g. headaches, chronic pain).  The purpose of this study is to 
determine whether acupuncture treatment can improve quality of life and activities of daily living in patients with MG.

5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 N/A 
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 Pre- screening Phone Call:  
All potential participants will undergo a pre -screening phone call to determine whether they meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be considered ineligible  if they do not meet one or more of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria during pre -screening. We will collect information on why participants are 
ineligible or decide not to move forward with the trial.  
 Pre- treatment Visit:  
Screen failures  are defined as participants who are considered eligible during the pre -screening phone 
call, but it was subsequently determined that they do not meet one or more of the incl usion/exclusion 
criteria at  or after  the Pre -treatment (baseline) v isit. We will collect information on why participants 
screen fail or decide not to move forward with the trial.  
 
Rescreening Patients:  
Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (ineligible or screen failure) because 
of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that are likely to change over time may be rescreened  up to one 
time . Examples include : successful treatment for a substance use disorder; women who are no longer 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  12 pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant; or participation in an interventional study ≥3 months  
prior.  Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment:  Individuals with MG  will be recruited by [CONTACT_252054][INVESTIGATOR_252038]’ clinics. We will also advertise our research study by [CONTACT_252055]’ physicians and throughout HealthPartners’ clinics. Recruitment flyers will also be provided to our community partners for example, the Minnesota Brain  Injury Alliance, TRIA, and Allina Health.  If we 
encounter difficulties with recruitment, we plan to submit an amendment to the IRB  to contact 
[CONTACT_252056].  
 To reach our target enrollment, we anticipate that we will need to screen 60 people,  of those 30 
individuals will sign the informed consent, and of those 25 individua ls will be randomized to treatment 
groups . 
 
Remuneration: Participants will be provided gift cards totaling $50 per person for completing certain time 
points of the research study.  Group 1:  Will receive a $[ADDRESS_306429] after all acupuncture treatments and 
surveys were completed, and another $[ADDRESS_306430] treatment visit, if all surveys were completed. Group 2:  Will receive a $[ADDRESS_306431] been 
completed and surveys were completed, and another $[ADDRESS_306432] -treatment visit, if all surveys were 
completed.  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION  
 The study intervention for both groups is acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture is a treatment where fine needles are inserted into specific areas of the body to achieve  a therapeutic benefit. The treatment 
regimen is described next in more detail.  
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
 
Acupuncture Treatment Methods:  
Group [ADDRESS_306433], sterile stainless -steel, disposable needles (DongBang™ Corporation, Spring Ten 0.2 2 x 30mm; 
Boryeoung, Republic of Korea) will be inserted in the acupuncture point locations (described below), with approximately  23-32 needles  used for each treatment session. The number of needles used will be based 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  13 on the patient -reported symptoms. The depth of the needle insertion will be approximately 10 -20mm, 
depending on the region of the body undergoing treatment. Needle reaction (soreness, numbness or 
distended feeling around the point, also known as a Deqi sensation) will occur during the init ial insertion. 
Following [ADDRESS_306434] for a total of 30 minutes, which is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_252039].  
 Acupuncture points were selected for their classical Traditional Chinese Medicine indications relevant to MG symptom pathology, as well as their modern biomedical muscular, immunological, and neurological actions.  The anatomical location for each point will be based on the World Health Organization’ s 
acupuncture point guideline.
[ADDRESS_306435] TRAINING AND TRACKING  
Acupuncturists:  
Acupuncture treatments will be administered by [CONTACT_252057] a Master’s degree level 
of training in acupuncture (or higher) from accredited institutions, and five or more years of clinical experience. Prior to enrolling participants, the acupuncturists will complete practice sessions together of the treatment protocol and methods of administration to ensure consistency between providers. 
 
Training:  
Following IRB approval and prior to recruitment and enrollment, the study acupuncturists will complete 
at least 1  practice session  each . For the training, we will seek volunteers who will sign a volunteer consent  
form  prior to participating. The purpose  of training  will be  to ensure consistency in intervention 
procedures  and further standardized treatment methods. This includes, but is not limited to: needle 
location, needle depth, time of first and last needle placement, and total  treatment duration.   
 
Tracking:  
All practice sessions will be documented on a training log. This will include  dates and times of the trainings, 
names of the volunteers, and printed names and signatures of the study acupuncturists. We will also keep 
a record of the volunteers’ signed treatment release forms. 
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 Randomization:  Randomization will be performed with a 1:[ADDRESS_306436] procedure in SAS. 
Assignments will not be seen by [CONTACT_252058].  
 Blinding:  
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /[ADDRESS_306437] a 12 -week delay and those who do not . In addition, it will be clear to participants which treatment 
group they are in and it will be impossible to blind them from this information.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
 
Participants will be asked to adhere to study visits and to complete study assessments . Participants will 
remain active unless withdrawn from the study (see Section 7 ). We will  track participants’ adherence to 
study visits, as well as completion of the assessments . These  will be documented in the relevant eCRF. 
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 For this protocol, participants may use non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_252040], including over- the-counter 
medications and dietary supplements, and prescribed medications . This includes use for rescue therapy 
in the event of exacerbation of symptoms due to acupuncture treatment. Medication  usage will be 
assessed at each study visit and documented in the relevant eCRF.  
 
6.5.1  RESCUE THERAPY  
 See section 6.5 (above).  
 
7 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DISCONTINUATION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 When a participant  who signed the consent form chooses to discontinue  participation in the study or 
study intervention , or if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators determine that a participant should 
discontinue participation , they will be withdrawn from the study. A withdrawal will either be defined as 
‘Patient Withdrawal’ or ‘Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_252041]’. The participant will be asked to complete an early withdraw al phone call 7- [ADDRESS_306438]  any AEs  or serious a dverse events (SAEs) that may have occurred after the 
discontinuation of treatment.  Research staff will attempt to call the participant up to 3 times . 
 
The data that will be collected at the time of study withdrawal will include the following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuation of the study  intervention  
 
The data that will be  collected during the early withdraw al phone call will include the following:  
• AEs or SAEs that occurred since the time of withdrawal 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY  
 Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  a participant from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  15 1. Participant has  not completed an acupuncture treatment for > [ADDRESS_306439]-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130]  (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
4. Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up  
study data would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
5. The participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the relevant 
eCRF. Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced. Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study, will not 
be replaced.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_306440] be taken if a participant fails to attend any required study visit:  
 
• Study staff  will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] , reschedule the missed visit , counsel the 
participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will m ake every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, t elephone calls  or e -mail – if no 
answer leave  a voicemail  on the first and last attempt ). These contact [CONTACT_252059].  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up. 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 Demographics: Demographic information will be collected, including: gender, age, race, ethnicity, 
language,  height, weight, marital status, employment status , date of MG diagnosis , and e -mail address for 
study  contact) . 
 Medication Review:  At study enrollment, participants ’ prescription  medications will be recorded and 
tracked for the study duration.  Medication data will be used for exploratory purposes.  
 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  16 Treatment Adherence:  The participant’s treatment adherence will be measured to determine tolerability 
of acupuncture. We will record the number of attended acupuncture sessions. We will also record  
participants’  ability to maintain the acupuncture duration of 30 minutes per session.  
 
Symptom Severity Scale:  This scale will assess the participant’s usual symptoms of MG and the severity 
of their symptoms. This scale was custom designed for this study.  
 
Quality of Life:  Participants will be asked to complete the MG -QOL15 ,14 a brief 15 -item disease specific 
questionnaire that is designed to assess aspects of quality of life in Myasthenia Gravis.  It includes 
questions regarding quality of life, such as vision, sp eaking, eating, and activities.  
 Activit ies of Daily Living:  Participants will be asked to complete the  MG-ADL,
15 an eight -item patient -
reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities.  It combines 2 items 
on daily life activitie s (ability to brush teeth or comb hair  and ability to arise from a chair) with 6 MG 
symptoms: diplopia, ptosis, chewing, swallowing, voice/speech problems, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
 A strong positive correlation between the MG -ADL and the MG -QOL15 (r= 0.76, P < 0.0001)  has been 
previously demonstrated.
15  
 Qualitative Feedback Survey: A list of qualitative feedback survey questions will allow for participant’s  to 
discuss their experience with acupuncture treatment.  
 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Assessment of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events:  
AEs and SAEs  will be monitored by [CONTACT_252060], and by [CONTACT_38992]. The acupuncturists and research staff will immediately notify the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_252042].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_252043], as discussed below.  
 
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of AE  from 21 CFR 312.32 (a) : any untoward medical occurren ce 
associated with the use of an intervention in huma ns, whether or not considered intervention -related . 
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 This protocol uses the definition of SAE  from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or study clinician, it results in any of the 
following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events t hat may not result 
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /[ADDRESS_306441] and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.   
 1. Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.  
2. Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
3. Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the 
term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 All AEs will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , assessed  by [CONTACT_252061] -trained clinician based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree 
of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study procedures administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153] . The response to withdrawal of the 
study procedures  should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically o r 
phenomenologically definitive . 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonable time after  administration of the study procedures , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal.  
• Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study procedures ). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE  may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study procedures  administration makes a causal relationship improbable 
(e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study procedures ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible 
explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  18 • Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study  procedures  administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 A clinician with expertise in MG  will be responsible for determining whether an AE  is expected or 
unexpected. An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the risk information previously described for the study procedures . 
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant . 
 All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured on the appropriate  eCRF. Information 
to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship 
to study procedures  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and 
time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9111] . 
 Study staff  will record events with start dates occurring any time after the first acupuncture treatment 
session until t he last post -treatment visit  for each  group . After the first acupuncture study and until study 
completion, study staff  will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs. All reported events will be 
monitored until the last  post -treatment visit  for each group . We will also conduct a [ADDRESS_306442] information on any advese events. Any reported event that is definitely or probably related to the intervention  will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 In consultation with the Principal Investigator ( PI) and the study clinician , a trained member of the study 
team will be  responsible for conducting an evaluation of an AE  and shall report the results of such 
evaluation to the reviewing IRB either at the time of continuing review or within 10 working days of 
becoming aware of the event if the event is considered to be serious or meets the definition of an unanticipated problem involving risks to study subjects or others.  
 
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /[ADDRESS_306443] learns of the 
event.  
 
8.3.7  REPORTING EVENT S TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
Following IRB review of any AEs or SAEs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_252044]’s recommended actions. This may include, but is not limited to, modifying the informed consent document or process, re -consenting current 
participants, providing information to past or current participants (e.g. whenever the information may relate to the participant’s willingness to continue participants), and modifications to the protocol/research plan.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_306444]  
 N/A 
 
8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
 Women who are currently pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study  are 
excluded from this study. This is due to the hormonal changes that may alter headache patterns. If any participant who is still undergoing acupuncture treatment expectedly or unexpectedly becomes pregnant 
while active in the trial, the participant will be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_079]. The participant will be asked to complete an early withdrawal phone call in 7 -14 days from  the date the  
intervention was discon tinued for safety follow -up. 
 If any participant  who has completed all acupuncture treatment sessions expectedly or unexpectedly 
becomes pregnant, the participant may remain in the study until study completion.  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_19819] ( OHRP ). OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to  participant s or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant  population being 
studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
3. Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  20 8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM S REPORTING  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_199779] ( UPs) to the reviewing IRB. The UP report will include the 
following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI ’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, i ncident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP  
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs will be reported to the IRB  as soon as possible, but no  later than [ADDRESS_306445] learns of the event  
 
8.4.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
 Following IRB review of any unanticipated problems, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_252044]’s recommended actions. This may include, but is not limited to, modifying the informed consent document or process, re -
consenting current participants, providing information to past or current participants (e.g. whenever the information may relate to the participant’s willingness to continue particip ants), and modifications to the 
protocol/research plan.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary:  
We hypothesize that q uality of life , as assessed by [CONTACT_4224] -QOL15, will improve with acupuncture 
treatment compared to no acupuncture treatment.  
 
• Secondary:  
We hypothesize that quality of life, as assessed by [CONTACT_252062], will improve with acupuncture treatment compared to no acupuncture treatment.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_306446] comparing  the mean change in MG -QOL15  over 12-weeks  weeks from a delayed start 2- group 
design. We hypothesize that Group 1 who received acupuncture treatment will experience a change in 
QOL over the 12 -weeks while Group 2 , the untreated control, will not. We  will analyze the data such that 
the opposite could be shown. The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between treatment

  21 groups. Our sample size of 10 subjects in each group achieves 80% power at a 5% significance level to 
detect a 1.32 SD difference in mean change in MG -QOL15 between groups (PASS software version 11). No 
interim analyses are planned. The potential effect on our power if for a range of true  effect size s are 
displayed in the table below.  If our final analysis shows a smaller effect size than 1.[ADDRESS_306447] -hoc power analysis with the results.

Based on preliminary estimates, we do not anticipate difficulty recruiting 20 subjects. HealthPartners clinicians  see approximately 4 individuals with MG per month  at the Neuroscience Center  and Park 
Nicollet  Clinics, approximately 50 annually . Therefore , we will need a 40% enrollment rate to reach our 
recruitment goal in the allotted time  frame.  In addition, we also plan to recruit and enroll from other 
HealthPartners clinics and within the community.  If we see a 20% reduction in sample size due to dropout, 
withdrawal, or missing data, our power will be 7 1% to detect a similar effect size. This, and other possible 
changes in power due to attrition, are listed in the table below. *Note: The original sample size  estimation 
was for 20 individuals; however, we wrote the protocol so that we could replace anyone who did not start the intervention. Thus, we are increasing the enrollment target to 25, which is not reflected in the original power analysis.

  22 we will instead report medians and interquartile ranges. Statistical significance will be determined using 
p-values less than 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals, unless otherwise indicated. All inferential tests will 
be two -sided. For descriptive statistics  (means, SDs, proportions) where no inferential statistics were 
conducted, we will refrain from making confirmative statements. All covariates will be pre -specified in the 
sections below. Any additional analyses will be described as post -hoc and explorator y.  
 Distribution of the outcome variables will be assessed prior to conduct of our analyses to determine if the planned tests are appropriate. If variables are found to be non -normally distributed we will explore the 
use of log -transformations or non -parametric tests such as the Wilcoxon -Rank Tests.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 The MG -QOL15 scores will be collected for each participant at several time points.  The primary outcome, 
change in  MG-QOL15 scores over the first 12- weeks , will be calculated using the first and second collected 
scores for both groups . Group [ADDRESS_306449] deviations.  Analysis of covariances  (ANCOVA) with adjustm ent for base line 
MG-QOL15 and covariates identified above will be used to determine if a significant (p<0.05) intervention 
effect is present. If the model identifies a significant difference in change of MG- QOL15 associated with 
acupuncture  treatment, next steps will assess if this change is still present [ADDRESS_306450] will be used to compare the MG-
QOL15 scores directly after treatment (Post-t reatment Assessment 1 ) and scores [ADDRESS_306451]-
treatment  (Post -treatment Assessment 2). (Refer to Schema on page 4 for data collection points.)  
 Prior to analysis, we will plot our outcomes to examine their distribution and decide whether we should consider non- parametric analyses. Only subjects with complete data from both pre -treatment assessment 
and 12-week assessment will be included in the final analysis. Data will be analyzed per an intent -to-treat 
approach regardless of actual treatment received. If a large proportion of missing data is noted, we will compare baseline characteristics of subjects who  completed the treatment with those who were lost to 
follow -up. 
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 Secondary analys es are not dependent on results of primary endpoint. Similar ANCOVA models using data 
from both groups will be used to determine whether acupuncture treatments were associated with a significant change in MG ADL scores. Before analysis, MG ADL scores will be summarized at each timepoint using measures of cen ter and spread as appropriate.  
 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 AE/SAEs will be reported as described in Section 8.3  of this document. They will be classified by [CONTACT_926], 
relationship to study procedures, and expectedness. No other formal safety analyses will be conducted.  
 
9.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 Baseline variables will be compared between groups to ensure randomization achieved balanced treatment assignments. This will include demographics (e.g. gender, age, race) .  All such variables are 
A21- 197 AcuMG   Version 7.0  
  Date 09/08 /23 
  23 listed in Section 8.1 of this document. Variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g. mean 
and SD, or frequency and proportion) and compared inferentially. Continuous variables will be compared 
using two -sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank tests and discrete variables will be compared using chi- square 
tests for independence or Fisher’s exact tests.

 Informed consent --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process and  10%  
of th e completed consent documents. F eedback will be provided to study staff  to ensure proper 
consenting procedures are followed . 
 Source documents  and the e lectronic data --- The majority of data  will be directly entered into eCRFs in 
REDCap. To ensure accuracy  for data not directly entered in REDCap, study staff will compare a 
representative sample of source data against the database, targeting key data points in that review.  
 Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are described in 
Section 6.2.1, Interventionist Training and Tracking . 
 
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review documented  protocol deviations on an ongoing basis 
and will implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of concern.

Version  Date  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
2.0 01/10/22  Response to RRC & IRB Review  Addressed reviewer changes  
3.0 03/02/22  Removal of electrical stimulation; 
change inclusion criteria age from 70 
to 80 ; Removal of cardiac/stimulator 
devices for exclusion as this was 
specific to electroacupuncture.  Pantheon did not support 
settings we planned to use and 
we only planned to stimulate one point. This will not change 
our hypothesis. Would like to 
include up to 80 to capture late 
onset MG.

5.0 02/16/23  Add qualitative questions, add letter 
for recruitment, remove Park Nicollet, and add Como clinic  Adding qualitative survey 
questions for additional feedback. Sending letter to potentially eligible individuals for recruitment efforts. Removing Park Nicollet clinic and adding Como Clinic for 
treatment locations.  
6.0 04/03/23  Add Stillwater Clinic  Change in locations for

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This document is a clinical investigation plan (CIP) for the clinical study  of the Electrode Screening Mode 
tool, hereafter referred to as the InformityTM tool, on Abbott’s Clinician Programmer for the InfinityTM deep 
brain stimulation (DBS) system. This c linical study  is intended to characterize the clinical performance  of 
the Informity tool in programming Infinity DBS systems in patients  with Parkinson’s disease  (PD) or 
essential tremor  (ET). This clinical study  is sponsored by [CONTACT_69735].  
 
This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with this CIP. All investigators involved in the conduct 
of the clinical study  will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, or experience to perform their tasks and this 
training will be documented appropriately.  
1.1 Background a nd Rationale  
 Background  
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become an indispensable therapeutic tool for treating Parkinson’s 
disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, and provides significant symptom relief and quality of life 
improvement with minimal risk [1 ]. It is preferred over  other  surgical treatment s due to its adjustability, 
reversibility, durability, and robust clinical effectiveness and safety.  
 
DBS modulates dysfunctional circuits in the brain so that the brain can function more effectively. This is  
accomplished by [CONTACT_398770], which 
overrides neural activity that causes neurological dysfunctions. These targets include the subthalamic 
nucleus (STN), globus pallidus interna (GPi), and ven tral intermediate (Vim) nucleus of the thalamus.  
 
Patients with DBS experience considerable improvements in their motor symptoms and are able to 
greatly reduce their medications [2 -4]. DBS allows for both unilateral and bilateral coverage of symptoms, 
can be tailored to a patient’s clinical status by [CONTACT_398771], and can provide 
continuous symptom control 24 hours a day with minimum patient and clinician involvement. The 
electrodes and electrical systems that provide stimulation are ge nerally very well tolerated with no 
significant changes in surrounding brain tissue [5].  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_398761], the benefit of this therapy is highly dependent on the location of the 
DBS lead and the distribution of the stimulation field with in the brain anatomy. DBS requires millimeter 
accuracy in targeting of specific deep brain nuclei, and precise control over the volume of tissue 
activated (VTA) via programming of stimulation parameters. When the lead is misplaced or the system is 
incorrec tly programmed, this may cause electrical current to spread to the surrounding associative, motor 
and limbic areas running near the target nuclei, which can lead to side effects. Common side effects 
include cognitive impairment, memory deficits, difficulti es with speech, disequilibrium, dysphagia, and 
motor and sensory disturbances [6].  
 
Conventional DBS leads use omnidirectional electrodes that disperse current axially and symmetrically 
around the activated contacts. Given the radial dispersion of current,  a high level of precision is 
necessary in lead placement to ensure effective therapy [7, 8]. Clinical studies have indicated that 
accurate placement of DBS leads is correlated to clinical efficacy [9, 10]. Further, limitations in the 
omnidirectional elect rode design translate to restrictions in the ability to sculpt the shape and size of the 
VTA, resulting in inadequate activated tissue volumes or inaccurate targeting of therapeutic regions [9, 
11, 12].

Recently, the development of directional DBS leads with segmented electrodes allows for focal current 
steering and improved clinical effectiveness [7, 11, 13, 14]. Computational modeling studies have shown 
that segmentation of the electrodes allows for expanded programming options, which could potentially 
reduce side effects, widen the therapeutic range, and lower the therapeutic current [12, 13, 15]. By [CONTACT_398772], the delivered stimulation field better fits the 
anatomy of the therapeutic target (Figure 1). B ased on a computational model developed by [CONTACT_398773], 
smaller directionally segmented electrodes demonstrated superior targeting of the cerebello -thalamo -
cortical pathway, especially in cases of misaligned DBS leads [7]. Modelling also suggests that 
segm entation of the electrode allows for an increase in magnitude of the activating function and 
electrode impedance while lowering the required stimulation intensity; thus, creating a greater radial 
distance of the VTA when compared to standard electrodes [13 , 14]. The targeted areas within 
anatomical structures (STN, GPi, and Vim thalamus) have restricted sizes that are associated with 
effective treatment. Figure [ADDRESS_502375] to the position of 
the electrode segment and target structure allows for improved therapeutic outcomes.

The 8 channel Infinity DBS system incorporates this concept of segmentation and directionality. This 
system includes directional leads, extensions, implanted pulse generators, clinician programmers, and 
patient controllers. Numerous publications with similar DBS systems and the market experience 
associated with the currently marketed Infinity DBS system demonstrate the s afety and performance of 
the 8 channel directional DBS leads, extensions and related accessories for treatment of movement 
disorders.  
 
The efficacy of directional DBS (dDBS) for the treatment of patients with movement disorders is 
supported with data from three prospective clinical studies.  Pollo et al (2014) conducted a prospective, 
single -center acute study to assess the effectiveness of dDBS in PD and tremor patients [9].  Compared 
to omnidirectional mode, directional stimulation in the best direction h ad a therapeutic window (current 
difference between side effects and therapeutic benefit) that was 41.3% wider than omnidirectional 
stimulation, and a therapeutic amplitude that was 43% lower than omnidirectional stimulation. Having a 
wider therapeutic win dow allows for expanded programming options, especially in cases of lead 
migration or brain shift, without a need for surgical intervention to regain therapeutic benefit. No adverse 
events were observed during the implantation of and stimulation using the dDBS lead. An acute 
evaluation of a dDBS lead was also conducted by [CONTACT_398774] (2014) [16].  Directional stimulation 
proved effective in this study in that it reduced the appearance of side effects, while widening the 
therapeutic window by [CONTACT_398775]. No unexpected adverse events were observed during 
the implantation of and stimulation using the dDBS lead. Finally, Steigerwald et al (2016) per formed an 
assessment of dDBS leads in Parkinson’s disease patients, and found that directional current steering 
increased the therapeutic window size compared to omnidirectional stimulation, although in a highly 
patient -specific manner [17]. No unexpected adverse events were reported with the use of the dDBS 
lead.  
 
The full benefits of dDBS are only realized if the stimulation parameters are selected appropriately to 
focus the VTA within the targeted brain area and avoid non -targeted brain regions. The Info rmity tool, 
available within the Clinician Programmer iPad application  (Artemis version 3.7  or later ), provides a 
standardized workflow to guide clinicians or trained healthcare providers through the DBS monopolar 
review screening process. This process inv olves assessment of the stimulation amplitudes that produce 
partial or complete therapeutic benefits and transient or sustained side effects, and is performed by 
[CONTACT_398776]. The Informity tool ena bles the 
neurologist to simultaneously perform this testing on a patient and record the results (Figure 3). 
Moreover, the tool allows the neurologist to review the results in different formats to aid in the selection of 
the best contact [CONTACT_398777] t hat patient (Figure 4). The selection of the best contact [CONTACT_398778]

(physician and/or research coordinator) previously trained to the CIP, and if applicable will be entered 
into a site-specific screening log.  
 
In case the subject does not meet all inclusion  criteria or meets any of the exclusion criteria, the subject 
is considered a screening failure. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_398762] a screening log as required.  
 
Subject  data will be co llected following enrollment into the clinical study . 
 Informed Consent  
The Investigator or his/her authorized designee will conduct the informed consent process, as required 
by [CONTACT_26137]’s IRB. This process will include a verbal  discussion with the 
subject on all aspects of the clinical study  that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate, such 
as details of clinical study  procedures, anticipated benefits, and potential risks of clinical study  
participation. Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the clinical study  at any time 
and for any reason without sanction, penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. 
Withdrawal from the clinical study  will not jeopardize their fut ure medical care or relationship with the 
investigator.  
 
During the discussion, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will avoid any improper 
influence on the subject and will respect subject’s legal rights. The subject shall be provid ed with the 
Informed Consent form written in a language that is understandable to the subject and has been 
approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s IRB. The subject shall have adequate time to review, ask questions and 
consider participation. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241543]/her authorized designee will make efforts to 
ensure that the subject understands the information provided. If the subject agrees to participate, the 
Informed Consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_398783] -specific procedures. The signed original will be filed in the subject’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26107], and a copy will be provided to the subject.  
 
Failure to obtain informed consent from a subject prior to clinical study  enrollment should be reported to 
Sponsor within 5 working days and to the reviewing center’s IRB  according to the IRB’s  reporting 
requirements.  
 
If, during the clinical study , new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject' s 
future health and medical care, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will provide this 
information to the subject. If relevant, the subject will be asked to confirm their continuing informed 
consent in writing.  
 
This clinical investi gation excludes individuals unable to make the decision to participate in a clinical 
investigation on their own or who are unable to fully understand all aspects of the investigation that are 
relevant to the decision to participate, or who could be manipul ated or unduly influenced as a result of a 
compromised position, expectation of benefits or fear of retaliatory response.  
 
In addition, an authorization for use and disclosure of the subject’s protected health information, in

taking on a long term basis, i.e. no short term medication  
 
Lost-to-Follow -up 
 
If the subject misses two consecutive scheduled follow -up time points and the attempts at contact[CONTACT_361880], then the subject is considered lost -to-follow -up. Site personnel 
shall make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the subject (and d ocument these efforts 
in the source documents), including the following, at each contact [CONTACT_7206]:  
• A minimum of two telephone calls on different days over the specified follow -up windows to 
contact [CONTACT_398785], including date, time and 
initials of site personnel trying to make contact.  
• If these attempts are unsuccessful, a certified letter should be sent to the subject.  
• If a subject misses one or more non -consecutive follow -up contact [CONTACT_150746] , it will be 
considered a missed visit. The subject may then return for subsequent visits. If the subject misses 
two consecutive time points and the above -mentioned attempts at communicating with the 
subject are unsuccessful, the subject will be considered lost -to-follow-up.  
 
Note:  Telephone contact [CONTACT_398786] , non -clinical investigation  neurologist  or relative 
without  the presence of the subject or indirect documentation obtained via discharge letters will not be 
considered as subject contact.  
5.[ADDRESS_502395]’s Participation  
The total expected duration of each subject’s participation in the clinical study  is approximately [ADDRESS_502396] Required  Number  of Subjects  
The expected duration of enrollment is approximately 18 months.

Template: [ADDRESS_502397] omnidirectional stimulation in use at the time of the Baseline visit. Informity should 
not be used. The following assessments and information will be collected at the Baseline visit:  
• Demographics - subject’s age and gender  
• Disease history - subject’s year of PD or ET symptom onset, year of initial PD or ET diagnosis, 
subject’s impression of worst symptom (PD subjects only)  
• Baseline programming - subject’s current DBS programming parameters  
• Therapeutic window of current parameter set  
• TEED of current parameter set  
• Duration of the most recent programming session preceding enrollment from the Clinician 
Programmer session logs (if available)  
• Medication dosage (only PD or ET  medications) - indicate the drug category the subject is 
currently taking on a long term basis, i.e. no short term medication  
• Preoperative motor symptom evaluation  (medication ON) from medical records (if available)  
• Preoperative quality of life assessment from medical records (if available)  
• DBS implant information  
• Pre-op MRI and post -op CT images  
 
An encrypted thumb drive  containing de -identified MRI and CT images for all study subjects will be 
provided to sites and images will be sent  to the Sponsor.  
 
The following activities will be performed at the Baseline visit:  
• Quality of life assessment  
• Motor symptom evaluation (stimulation ON/medication ON) performed by a blinded assessor  
 
The quality of life assessment must be performed prior to the motor symptom ev aluation. Quality of life 
assessments will be performed using PDQ -[ADDRESS_502398] for ET subjects (see Section 
6.3.2). Quality of life assessment does not need to be collected if a patient was reprogrammed to 
omnidirectional stimulation on th e same day as the Baseline visit. Motor symptom evaluation will be 
performed using UPDRS part III for PD subjects and Fahn -Tolosa -Marin tremor rating scale for ET 
subjects. For both evaluations, responses are rated on a 0 to 4 -point scale where 0 indicates  ‘none’ and 
4 indicates ‘severe’ symptom. Motor symptom evaluation will be performed by a blinded assessor, who 
will not be aware of the subject’s programming.  
 
The Baseline visit can occur on the same day as the Enrollment visit, or on a separate day  following the 
Enrollment visit.  It should be ensured that the patient is programmed with omnidirectional stimulation 
upon enrollment . If the Baseline visit occurs on the same day, it is not necessary to collect quality of life 
measurements.  The duration from the Enrollment visit to the Baseline visit  must be less than or equal to 
30 days.  
 ABT-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. D  
Study Name: [CONTACT_398804], distributed, disclosed or used without the 
express written consent of Abbott  
Template: [ADDRESS_502399]’s Infinity DBS system will be programmed by a trained 
programmer (clinician or trained healthcare provider) using the Informity tool. The  Clinician Programmer 
App IFU provide s specific instruction s for use of the Informity tool.  
 
Subjects are to be instructed not to take their medication the night prior to or the morning of the Informity  
Programming visit; or depending on the type of medication the subject is taking (i .e. extended release or 
long acting) the investigator can use their clinical judgement to determine an adequate length of time that 
the subject should be off medication prior to the testing.  
 
Using the Informity tool, multiple electrode contact  [CONTACT_278008] s on each lead will be assessed by a 
programmer for therapeutic effects followed by [CONTACT_398787]. The Best Segmented level 
(BSL) should be determined. Once the BSL has been determined, at a minimum, the th ree single 
segments at the BSL must be assessed. As the amplitude is increased by [CONTACT_45449], the 
therapeutic effect on the motor symptoms will be based on the programmer’s clinical judgement of partial 
and complete therapeutic benefit seen for the sub ject’s primary motor symptoms. Once first therapeutic 
effect is determined, the programmer will test for transient and sustained side effects.  
 
The width of the therapeutic window is defined as the electrical current at which a side effect appeared 
minus the electrical current at which complete therapeutic benefit was obtained. The TEED is defined as 
the total energy delivered by [CONTACT_398788], and is determined from the 
programmed stimulation parameters and measured program i mpedance.  
 
The programmer will review the results of the Informity tool to aid in selection of the electrode contact 
[CONTACT_398789]. The Balance Threshold or TW% ranking options must be 
evaluated in the decision process. The Informity  Tool Programming Guidance document provides step -
by-step instructions for using the Informity tool to select the electrode contact [CONTACT_278008].  Subjects are 
expected to remain programmed with this configuration from the Informity  Programming  visit until the [ADDRESS_502400]/segment test ed. If desired by [CONTACT_398790], 
Informity  Programming can be separated into two visits performed on back -to-back days in which the left -
side or right -side DBS leads are separately programmed and evaluated  (if the patient has bilateral DBS 
leads) . If Informity  Programming is performed over back -to-back days, then the programmer satisfaction 
survey is assessed on the second day.  
 
The programmer who performs Informity tool programming must be differe nt from the person who  
previously programmed that subject’s DBS system.  
 
The subject may be given a Patient Controller after the Informity  Programming procedure, dependent on 
the clinician’s recommendation for patient care.  
 
The duration from the Baseline  visit to the Informity  Programming visit must be 21±7  days .

 Assessments  
The following will be collected during the Informity  Programming visit:  
• Informity  programming data , programming parameters , duration of programming  and program 
impedance . 
• Programmer satisfaction survey  
• Programmer Experience  
6.3 Follow -up Assessments   
 Follow -up for All Subjects (Site Visit)  
Follow -up visits are scheduled at [ADDRESS_502401] be completed:  
• Quality of life assessment  
• Motor symptom evaluation (stimulation ON/medication  ON) performed by a blinded assessor  
• Medication (only PD or ET medications) - indicate the drug category the subject is currently taking 
on a long -term basis, i.e. no short -term medication  
• Interrogation of programmed settings and program impedance.  
 
The quality of life assessment must be performed prior to the motor symptom evaluation. Motor symptom 
evaluation will be performed by a blinded assessor, who will not be aware of the subject’s  programming.  
 
If in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the  selected DBS electrode contact [CONTACT_398791] a follow -up visit, the subject’s DBS system parameter s can be 
adjusted . by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -programming with the Informity tool. This re -programming should be performed us ing the 
same procedure detailed in Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_502402] 
be performed before and after re -programming at th e follow -up visit.  
 
An unscheduled visit is defined as any visit that occurs outside of a specified study visit  related to an 
adverse event or withdrawal of the patient from the study . Any routine  programming that occurs outside 
of a study visit  will be captured at the subsequent study  visit. Any unscheduled visit needs to be 
documented by [CONTACT_398792] 
(Adverse Event, Withdrawal, Programming, and Medication ). 
 Patient Reported Outco me (PRO)  Measures  
The coordinator or designee will administer patient -reported outcome questionnaires. It is important the 
subject understands the meaning of all words and instructions in the questionnaires. The subject should 
be instructed to ask any questions about the questionnaires if further explanation is needed. Once the 
questio nnaires are completed, the  Coordinator or designee will review for completeness to verify that all 
questions have been answered according to the directions provided.  
 
The following PRO measures will be collected according to the CIP  requirements  (Sections 6.1.1 and 
6.3.1) : 
• Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39)

Template: [ZIP_CODE] Rev. E   Page 23 of 45  
• Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST)  
 
The Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ -39) is a widely used validated questionnaire used to 
measure PD specific health status [18]. The self -administered questionnaire consists of 39 questions and 
takes approximately 10 -20 minutes to complete with pape r & pencil. The subject is instructed to answer 
one of five response categories depending on how often (from never to always) they have experienced 
the problem addressed by [CONTACT_398793]. There is a total of 8 dimensions 
that re present mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well -being, social support, cognition, 
communication and bodily discomfort. For each question, a 5 -point ordinal scoring system is assigned (0 
to 4), and the results are summed across all questions an d scaled to a 100-point  system. Lower scores 
reflect a better quality of life.  
 
The Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) is a disease -specific assessment used to 
measure the quality of life of ET patients [19]. The self -administered qu estionnaire consists of 30 
questions and is completed with paper & pencil. The subject is instructed to answer one of five response 
categories depending on the frequency (from never to always) with which tremor was found to impact 
functional activity or wa s associated with specific feelings. For each question, a 5 -point ordinal scoring 
system is assigned (0 to 4). The 30 items are divided into five sub -scales (physical/ADL, psychosocial, 
communication, hobbies/leisure, and work/finances), and the score for each sub -scale is expressed as a 
percentage of the total score possible for that sub -scale. Lower scores reflect less dissatisfaction or 
disability due to essential tremor.

Template: [ADDRESS_502403] definitions and reporting timelines to be 
used and adhered to by [CONTACT_473].  
7.1 Definition  
 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not 
related to the medical device  under  investigation . 
 
Note 1:  This definition includes events related to the medical device  under investigation . 
Note 2:  This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
Note 3:  For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to medical devices  under 
investigation . 
 Serious Adverse Event  
If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse event (SAE).  
 
a) Led to a death,  
b) Led to a serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted in  
1. a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
2. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
3. in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
4. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a bo dy structure or a body function, or  
5. chronic disease  
c) Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
Note : A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_10396], without a 
serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a n SAE . 
7.[ADDRESS_502404] or  device  under 
investigation  caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by [CONTACT_398794]. Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, 
 ABT-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. D

evidence of altern ative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and patient condition (pre -existing 
condition).  
7.[ADDRESS_502405]’s participation in the study ends .  
 
Clinical S ite Reporting timelines  
All Sites  Serious a dverse events  must be reported  to the Sponsor  no later than 3 
calendar days from the day the site  personnel became aware of the event or as 
per the investigative site’s local requirements, if the requirement is more 
stringent than those outlined.  
 
The date the site staff became aware  the event met the criteria of a n SAE  per protocol must be re corded 
in the source document.  The Investigator will further r eport the SAE to the local IRB  according to the 
institution’s  IRB reporting requirements.  
 
Records related to the subject’s subsequent medical course must be maintained and submitted (as 
applicable) t o the Sponsor until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the 
event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained. Adverse events will be monitored 
until they are adequately resolved. The status of the subject ’s condition should be documented at each 
visit. 
 
Reportable events to sponsor are considered:  
• All adverse events related to the device , stimulation,  and/or procedure regardless if serious or 
non-serious  
• All death events  
 
For unexpected failure modes or u nexpected AEs, the site should follow their standard reporting 
practices for medical device reporting (MDR). As defined in [ADDRESS_502406] reportable event (or 
reportable event) is an event that device user facilities become aware of that reasonably sugg ests that a 
device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. A device user facility must 
report deaths and serious injuries that a device has or may have caused or contributed to; establish and 
maintain AE files, and submit summar y annual reports to FDA.

Complaints reporting:  A complaint is defined as a deficiency related to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a device after it is released for distribution. All device 
complaints/malfunctions should be reported to the Sponsor’ s Customer Service Department.  
 
If the complaint does not involve an AE, the investigator must notify the Abbott Post Market Surveillance 
Department by [CONTACT_398795]@ abbott .com or by [CONTACT_648] 
[PHONE_8290] as soon as possible after becoming aware of the complaint.  
 Procedure for Recording and Reporting Subject Death  
Should death occur, the investigator is requested to record death information in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_398763] o n the Adverse Event CRF  and submit to Sponsor  per the serious adverse 
events reporting requirements stated in the ‘Adverse Event Reporting Requirements’ section (7.3.1).  
• All efforts to obtain the details about the circumstances surrounding the patient deat h should be 
made by [CONTACT_737].  
 
The subject’s death is an early conclusion of the subject’s participation in the clinical investigation. 
Therefore, the Investigator is required to complete the Withdrawal CRF. 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The following  section describes the statistical methods for the clinical study . Additional details on 
statistical analyses, including justification of clinical study  design, sensitivity analyses, poolability 
analyses, subgroup analyses and analysis of descriptive endpo ints, may be maintained in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP).  
8.1 Statistical Analyses  
 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  Analyses  
The hypotheses  for the primary endpoints  are that the Informity  tool will identify DBS parameters that:  
1. Have a larger therapeutic window size compared to programmed parameters at baseline  
2. Have a lower TEED compared to programmed parameters at baseline  
 
A comparison of therapeutic window and TEED will be performed for the contact [CONTACT_398796], and the contact [CONTACT_398797], using a 
paired t -test. All statistical analyses will be conducted assuming a type -1 error rate of 0.05 unless 
specifically s tated otherwise.  The change in TEED from baseline to Informity  programming will be used 
to calculate a corresponding battery longevity projection.  
 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint Analyses  
The hypotheses  for the secondary endpoints  are:  
1. The Informity tool will identify DBS parameters that improve motor symptom scores compared to 
baseline  
2. The Informity tool will identify DBS parameters that improve quality of life measurements 
compared to baseline.  
The time required for programming with the In formity tool is shorter than that of the most recent 
programming session prior to enrollment.  
 ABT-CIP-[ZIP_CODE] Ver. D  
Study Name: [CONTACT_398804], distributed, disclosed or used without the 
express written consent of Abbott  
Template: [ZIP_CODE] Rev. E   Page 27 of 45  
For the change in motor symptom scores, a repeated measure  analysis of variance (RMANOVA) will be 
conducted to determine statistical differences from baseline. Po st-hoc Tukey’s pairwise comparisons will 
follow to determine specific differences between follow -up visits. The change in quality of life 
measurement will also be analyzed using a RMANOVA followed by [CONTACT_397618]’s pairwise comparisons. A 
comparison of the durati on of programming will be performed for the programming session preceding 
enrollment, and the Informity  programming session with the Informity  tool, using a paired t -test. All 
statistical analyses will be conducted assuming a type -[ADDRESS_502407] evaluable primary endpoint data at the 6-month follow -up visit.  
8.3 Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analysis will be performed on the basis of diagnosis (Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor).  
Subgroup analysis will also be performed for tho se subjects who were programmed with DBS contact 2 
or 3 (full ring or individual segments) as a cathode at the Baseline visit . 
8.4 Multiplicity  
All statistical tests will be performed with a type -1 error rate 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Family -wise 
error fo r RMANOVA will be addressed using Tukey’s pairwise post -hoc comparisons.  
8.[ADDRESS_502408] completed the  3-month follow -up visit , and 
when all subjects in a diagnosis subgroup (Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor) complete the 6-
month follow -up visit.  
8.7 Statistical Criteria for Termination  
There are no statistical criteria for termination of this clinical study . 
8.8 Deviations from S tatistical Plan  
Any major changes to the statistical plan will be documented in an amendment to the statistical plan. 
Less significant changes to the planned analyses will be documented in the final report.

Some models of this DBS system are Magnetic Resonance (MR) Conditional, and patients with these 
devices may be scanned safely with MRI when the conditions for s afe scanning are met. Scanning under 
different conditions may cause device malfunction, severe patient injury, or death. For more information 
about MR Conditional DBS components and systems, including equipment settings, scanning 
procedures, and a complete  list of conditionally approved components, refer to the MRI procedures 
clinician’s manual for DB S systems. The St. Jude Medical  MR Conditional neurostimulation system has 
been designed to minimize the potential adverse events that may cause patient harm. The following 
potential adverse events may occur in the MRI environment:  
o Lead electrode heating resulting in tissue damage or serious patient injury  
o IPG heating resulting in tissue damage in the implant pocket or patient discomfort or both  
o Induced currents  on leads resulting in unpleasant sensations or motor disturbances  
o Damage to the IPGs, leads, or extensions causing the system to fail to deliver stimulation or 
causing the system to deliver overstimulation  
o Damage to the functionality or mechanical integri ty of the IPG resulting in the inability to 
communicate with the IPG  
o Movement or vibration of the IPGs, leads, or extensions  
 
Do not perform MRI on a patient if they have any model of this DBS system that is MR Unsafe (Section 
2.2.1). Even if the neurostimulator has been removed, the patient should not have an MRI if any part of a 
MR Unsafe model  of this DBS system  is still implanted.

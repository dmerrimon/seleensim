Phase 2  
BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE TRIAL  
Nocturia is defined by [CONTACT_67285] (ICS) as waking from sleep (during the 
night) at least once to urinate. This may occur when there is an excessive urine production during 
the night (noc turnal polyuria [NP]). The anti diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a 
key role in the control of urine production during the night. Desmopressin,  a synthetic analogue of 
AVP  developed by [CONTACT_480222] , is approved and used for the treatment of nocturia due 
to NP in more than 80  countries, including Canada and European countries. However, 
desmopressin has not yet been approved for this indication in the [LOCATION_003] .  
Low doses of desmopressin (25 µg for women and 50 µg for men) are approved to date in Canada, 
Australia and European countries under the trade name [CONTACT_765444] (desmopressin Orally 
Disintegrating Tablet [ODT]). These gender specific minimum effective low doses are approved for 
use in all adult ages an d are indicated for treatment of nocturia due to NP in adults, who awaken 
two or more times each night to void. The global cumulative patient exposure of NOCDURNA by 
[CONTACT_124702]-2016 is 1,389 patient years based on a dose of 25  μg for women and 50  μg for men (wome n: 
779 patient years; men: 610 patient years). Analysis of the combined data from three trials of 
low-dose desmopressin ODT, comprising >1400 patients with nocturia, shows that desmopressin 
dose, patient age, baseline serum sodium levels, and kidney functi on according to estimated

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  glomerular filtration rate clearance were significant risk factors for hyponatraemia in both sexes.  
Ferring Pharmceuticals is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_765343]  201836, another  synthetic analogue of AVP and 
a potent and highly selective shor t-acting vasopressin -2 (V 2)-receptor agonist with an antidiuretic 
action profile suitable for treating nocturia due to NP in adults. FE [ADDRESS_1049127] should provide an antidiure tic 
duration of action not exceeding 6 -8 hours i.e., corresponding to the night -time sleep period when 
drinking does not occur or is limited to a minimum  (to satisfy thirst).  The oral half-life should be 
shorter than that of desmopressin and the key route of metabolism non -renal, since the clinical 
promise of a short -acting V 2-receptor agonist is based on an improved safety profile without a 
prolonged duration of action leading to hyponatraemia. A shorter and more predictable duration of 
antidiuretic action  would minimise the risk of hyponatraemia and may reduce the need for serum 
sodium monitoring.  
In the present clinical trial, 6 doses of FE  201836 (50-500 µg) will be evaluated for estimation of 
the dose -response curve, where the response is the change in the number of nocturnal voids. The 
choice of FE  [ADDRESS_1049128] of FE  201836 in 
healthy subjects and by [CONTACT_765371].  
In phase 1 trial 000195  in young healthy men and women oral doses of FE  201836 up to 4800  µg 
(i.e., 9.6  times higher than the suggested maximum dose in the present phase 2 trial) were 
administered and found to be safe and well tolerated. The exposure after  intravenous infusion of 
0.[ADDRESS_1049129].  
The present trial is powered for detecting differences in treatment effec ts between FE  201836 and 
placebo. Desmopressin is included as benchmark treatment . There is no prospectively planned 
power for conclusive inference  with regards to differences between desmopressin and placebo (or 
FE 201836).  
In order to select trial subjec ts with nocturia primarily due to the underlying condition of NP driven 
with increased Free Water Clearance (FWC), who will benefit the most from treatment with an 
antidiuretic agent, a 1 -week active run -in period followed by a 1 -week washout period  (refer red to 
as the ‘enrichment period’)  will be applied to ensure that drug -responders (defined as a reduction of 
nocturnal diuresis [mL/min]of 20% or more) are identified. The ≥20% dec rease in the nocturnal 
diuresis rate  has been established as a relevant mark er of antidiurectic responsivene ss in previous 
nocturia trials  with an active run -in. The majority of fluid output occurs via the urine, 
approximately 1 ,500 mL/day, therefore there is no evidence in adult nocturia patients that the

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  relative change over the  time in nocturnal diuresis rate ( mL/min  normalised to time in bed) should 
be adjusted for body weight and or/body surface area which are both assumed to be constant over a 
short period of just [ADDRESS_1049130] data found that reducing 
Nocturnal Urine V olume (NUV) and increasing  the duration of antidiuretic action of a V 2-receptor 
agonist (desmopressin) was a significant predictor for subsequent decrease from baseline in the 
number of nocturnal voids.  
The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of NP can be driven by [CONTACT_765372] d FWC, which 
based on mode of action will be responsive to antidiuretic treatment, or by [CONTACT_765373], which differs s ubstantially in mode of action and is governed by [CONTACT_765374] (ANP) which again is directly and indirectly influenced by [CONTACT_765375] -Angiotensin -
Aldosterone System (RAAS).  
The aim of the active run -in is (after excluding all other medical causes of NP) to identify subjects 
with increased FWC which is  responsive to V 2-receptor agonism. In addition, safety will be 
assessed in this period with spe cial emphasis on hyponatraemia.

METHODOLOGY  
This is a randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, response -adaptive, dose -finding trial 
investigating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 6 different oral doses ( 50-500 µg) of 
FE 201836, with desmopressin as a benchmark, during [ADDRESS_1049136] of a 2 -week screening/lifestyle changes 
period where no Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP) will be given, an enrichment period 
consisting of a 1-week single -blind (to subjects) active run -in period and a [ADDRESS_1049137] . During th e active run -in 
period the trial subjects will receive 500  µg FE 201836 and placebo to assess safety and establish 
that subjects who respond to treatment with FE  201836 are included in the trial (i.e., an enrichment 
design).  
The 12 -week double -blind random ised treatment period of the trial will follow  a response -adaptive 
Bayesian top -down design. Initially subjects will be randomised to: placebo, 500  µg FE  201836 or 
desmopressin (for benchmarking only). When approximately [ADDRESS_1049138] been randomised t o 
the trial, an interim analysis will be conducted  to investigate the efficacy of 500  µg FE  201836. If 
500 µg FE  201836 is not sufficiently efficacious compared to placebo the trial will be stopped for 
futility. If 500  µg FE  201836 is efficacious additiona l doses of FE  201836 (doses 50 -350 µg) will 
be opened up for randomisation of new sub jects in order to identify the Minimum Effective Dose 
(MED) and near maximal Effective D ose (ED 85). The ED [ADDRESS_1049139]

interim analyses will take place every [ADDRESS_1049140] interim analysis eligible subjects will be randomised to one of 8 treatment groups  
(Table S -1). Each subject will be instructed to take the IMP every night at bedtime with the 
intention to sleep. In order to keep the treatment blinded each subject will receive two medications 
throughout th e trial; an oral solution and an Orally Disintegrating Tablet (ODT), i.e., a double -
dummy design will be applied because desmopressin is available in an ODT formulation and 
FE 201836 is an oral solution.  
Subjects will be asked to follow lifestyle changes ( e.g., limiting fluid intake) throughout the entire

assessments  and Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaires  before and after randomisation. 
One objectiv e of the present trial is to further validate the NI Diary. Therefore, a sample of subjects 
(from trial sites in the US A) who have completed the trial will be invited to participate in an exit 
interview within 14 days of attending the end -of-trial visit (V isit 8), to record the subjects’ 
perception of what constitutes a meaningful change in the NI Diary Total Score . 
Safety, including serum sodium levels, adverse events and clinically significant changes in vital 
signs and laboratory values will be monitored  throughout the trial and reviewed on an ongoing 
basis by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) .

<130  mmol/L is statistically significantly >10% during the active run -in, the Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) will be notified and  further action will be discussed, e.g., the DMC may 
recommend that the highest dose of FE  201836 ma y be replaced by a lower dose. T he trial is 
designed so the dose may be lowered from 500  µg to 3 50 µg, if recommended by [CONTACT_1363] . 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
A maximum of 300 subjects (males and females) will be  randomised into the trial.  At least 50% of

Primary Analysis Model used in  the Response -adaptive Trial Design  
The primary an alysis is based on a time -course hierarchical longitudinal model, i.e.,  
𝑌𝑡,𝑖=𝑒𝛾𝑡(𝜇𝑑,𝑖+𝛿𝑖)+ 𝜀𝑡 
where Y t,i is the change from baseline in number of nocturnal voids at visit t for subject i, d is the 
dose, 𝑒𝛾𝑡 the fraction of the effect at Visit t (Week 1, Week  4 or Week 8) as compared to the Month 
3 visit ( 𝛾t=0 at Month 3), δ i the random subject effect and ε t the independent N(0, 𝜆𝑡2) distributed 
error term. The dose -response for subject  𝑖, 𝜇𝑑,𝑖, is adjusted for the number of baseline voids ( 𝑥0,𝑖) 
and modelled using the sigmoidal E -max model, i.e.,  
𝜇𝑑,𝑖=𝛽𝑥0,𝑖+𝛼1+(𝛼2−𝛼1) 𝑑𝛼4
𝑑𝛼4+𝛼3𝛼4=𝛽𝑥0,𝑖+𝜇𝑑  
Inference will be based on a Bayesian analysis using sufficiently non -informative priors on 
respective parameters. The trial will be considered successful if the maximum dose has a greater 
than 97.5% posterior probability of being better than placebo, i.e. , if Pr( μMAX < μ Plb) > 97.5%.  
Response -adaptive Decision Rules  
The double -blind treatment period is based on a response -adaptive Bayesian top -down design. 
After an initial [ADDRESS_1049149] been randomised to placebo, 500 µg FE 201836  (the highest dose) 
or desmopressin in a 2:2:[ADDRESS_1049150] to stop for futility if the Pr ( μMAX 
– μPlb < -0.3) <10%, where Pr (.)  denotes posterior probability (under the assumed mon otonic dose -
response relation, i.e. smaller doses will be less e ffective).  
If not stopped for futility, all treatment arms will be opened up for randomisation, subjects can be 
randomised to placebo, desmopressin or to any FE 201836 dose (50 -500 µg) in a 2:1:7 ratio. When 
allocated to a FE  201836 dose (7/10), unrestrict ed randomisation will be used to allocate a subject

and I(dose is ED 85), where I(target)  is the probability that “dose is target” scaled by [CONTACT_765379]. The MED is the lowest dose that has at least a ∆=0.[ADDRESS_1049151] 
85% of the effect of the  maximum dose ( 500 µg).  
After the first interim analysis, subsequent interims will take place every [ADDRESS_1049152] if Pr ( μMAX – μPlb < -0.3) < 5.  
Operating Character istics  
Under the assumptions (based on previous  desmopressin trials and feasibility) that:  
• Response fractions of 0.8142, 0. 9328 and 0.9874 at Weeks 1, 4 and 8, respectively , as 
compared to the averaged dose -response at Week 12  
• Varian ce fractions of 0.8481 , 0.8329 and 0.8900 at Weeks 1, 4 and 8, respectively, as 
compared to the averaged dose -response at Week 12  
• A constant drop -out rate of 15% during the randomised treatment period  
• A between to total variance (σ2) ratio of 0.90 and a true underlying σ of 0.9 5 
• During the initial 17 weeks  the recruitment rate will increase line arly from 0  to 8.2 subjec ts 
per week  
• After [ADDRESS_1049153] been initiated, the recruitment rate is assumed to 
remain constant at 8.2  subjects per week  
and  
• Considering six dose-response scenarios for the mean change from baseline to a large extent 
is characterised by [CONTACT_765380] ( 500 µg FE  201836 )

The trial has been designed with the option to decrease the maximum  dose of FE  [ADDRESS_1049154] interim analysis 
(when the  first 125 subjects are randomised) the remaining subjects will be randomised to the 
following treatment groups: placebo, desmopressin (25 µg for females and 50 µg for males) or

The dose -response model will be fitted across all doses, i.e., 0 -500 µg, but inference will be made 
only on the doses th at remain open to randomisation  e.g., 0 -350 µg. That is, the MED and ED 85

• Normal lower limit of serum sodium >135 mmol/L  
• Mild hyponatraemia : serum sodium 134 -130 mmol/L  
• Moderate* hyponatraemia : serum sodium <130 mmol/L  
• Severe hyponatraemia : serum sodium <125 mmol/L  
* Moderate hyponatraemia  is equivalent to the term ‘clinically significant 
hyponatraemia ‘ (Verbalis,  2013) 
Nocturnal diuresis  The nocturnal diuresis rate  is calculated from the mean of 3 days 
Nocturnal Urine Volume ( NUV) and total time  in bed:

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Nocturia is defined by [CONTACT_67285] (ICS) as waking  from sleep (during the 
night) at least once to urinate. Nocturia is a symptom complex associated with several underlying 
medical and urological causes and pathologies ( van Kerrebroeck, 2002 ; Wein , 2002). It is common 
in the elderly, occurring in up to 50% of men and women older than  75 years ( Bosch,  2010). 
Nocturia is associated with a variety of clinical syndromes and disorders, which may result from 
(van Kerrebroeck, 2002 ): 
• Disorders that cause frequent low volume vo ids (e.g., Overactive Bladder [ OAB ], Bladder 
Outlet Obstruction [ BOO ], stiffer/less -compliant/functionally -smaller  bladder associated 
with aging)  
or 
• frequent high volume voids (e.g., Nocturnal Polyuria  [NP] , global polyuria [d iabetes 
insipi[INVESTIGATOR_765351]] ) 
or 
• a combin ation of both, which is common.  
As described  above , NP is a subset of nocturia  defined as excessive volume of urine produced at 
night. The human body typi[INVESTIGATOR_765352]. People with NP produce larger 
volumes of urine when asleep, causing them to awaken multiple times in the night to void. Thus, 
the diagnosis nocturia may be applied  when there is an excessive urine production during the night . 
Nocturnal polyuria  has been attributed to:  
• Abnormalities in diurnal variation in vasopressin secretion (a condition also coined  as NP 
syndrome ) (Asplund,  1991) 
• Abnormalities in the diuresis of solutes (e.g., urea, sodium, potassium)  
• Night time mobilisation of oedematous fluid in conditions such as congestive heart failure, 
nephrotic sy ndrome, or venous insufficiency  
However, as described abo ve, patients often have more than one symptom  presenting as  nocturia 
(or NP); e.g., high volume of urine at night in combination with low volume bladder (perhaps 
associated with ageing) and BOO . 
Taken together, these facts make the clinical situation compl icated since patients may have NP 
overlaid symptoms associated with frequent, low -volume voids, including OAB and Benign 
Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) . 
The anti diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a key role in the control of urine

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  80 countries, including Canada and European countries. However, desmopressin has not yet been 
approved for this indication in the [LOCATION_003] . 
Low doses of desmopressin (25 µg for women and 50 µg for men ) are  approved to date in Canada, 
Australia and Europe an countries  under the trade name [CONTACT_765444]  (desmopr essin Orally 
Disintegrating Tablet [ODT]) . These gender specific minimum effective low doses are approved for 
use in all adult ages and are indicated for treatment of nocturia due to NP in adults, who awaken 
two or more times each night to void. The global  cumulative patient exposure of NOCDURNA by 
[CONTACT_124702]-2016 is 1 ,389 patient years based on a dose of 25  μg for women  and 50  μg for men  (women: 
779 patient years; men : 610 patient years).  Analysis of the combined data from three trials of 
low-dose desmopressin OD T, comprising >1400 patients with nocturia, shows that desmopressin 
dose, patient age, baseline serum sodium levels, and kidney function according to estimated 
glomerular filtration rate clearance were significant risk factors for hyponatraemia in both sex es 
(Juul, 2016). 
Ferring Pharm aceuticals is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_765343] 201836, another  synthetic analogue of AVP 
and a potent and highly selective short -acting vasopressin -2 (V 2)-receptor agonist with an 
antidiuretic action profile suitable for treating nocturia due to NP in adults. FE [ADDRESS_1049172] should provide an antidiuretic duration of action not 
exceeding 6 -8 hours i.e., corresponding to the night -time sleep period when drinking does not occur 
or is limi ted to a minimum  (to satisfy thirst  only). The oral half -life should be shorter than that of 
desmopressin and  the key route of metabolism non -renal, since th e clinical promise of a short -
acting V 2-receptor agonist is based on an improved safety profile without a prolonged duration of 
action potentially leading to hyponatraemia. A shorter and more predictable duration of antidiuretic 
action would minimise the r isk of hyponatraemia and may reduce the need for serum sodium 
monitoring.  
In the present clinical trial, 6 doses of FE 201836  (50-500 µg) will be evaluated for estimation of 
the dose -response curve, where the response is the change in the number of nocturnal voids. The

The present trial is powered for detecting differences in treatment effects between FE  201836 and

power for conclusive inference with regards to differences between desmopressin and placebo (or

1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects  
Benefits  
Subjects enrolled in the present  trial will be closely monitored and they will have the same or more 
frequent visits to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765353] t o routine  treatment, depending on local practice. During 
these visits the subjects will be given instructions regarding lifestyle changes (including limiting 
fluid intake ). For some subjects the implementation of lifestyle changes might  be enough to reduce  
bothersome nocturia, defined as [ADDRESS_1049176] . 
An improved safety profile is expected to result from this combination of characteristics. The short 
half-life of FE  201836 (approximately  2 hours) and low degree of unchanged renal excretion 
(approximately  5%) are designed to limit the antidiuretic effect  to the night -time sleep period, when 
subjec ts do not drink or their fluid intake is limited to a minimum  (to satisfy thirst  only). Therefore, 
the risk for dilutional hyponatraemia that may occur after the subjec t starts drinking in the morning 
is expected  to be l ow. 
Subjects in the phase 1 clinical trial 000195 were dosed with up to 48 00 µg (i.e. , 9.6 times higher 
than the suggested maximum dose in the present phase 2 trial ) orally without any subject being 
hyponatr aemic.  Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD ) modelling suggests that the duration 
of antidiuretic  effect at 500  µg will be approximately  6 hours, limiting the potential for daytime 
antidiuresis.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  3.1.2 Overall Design and Control Methods  
This is a randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, response -adaptive, dose -finding trial 
investigating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 6 different oral doses ( 50-500 µg) of 
FE 201836, with desmopressin as a benchmark, during 12  weeks of treatment for nocturia due to 
NP in adults.  
The trial will comprise  8 visits (Section 3.1.1 ) to the  clinic and will consist  of a 2 -week 
screening/lifestyle changes period  where no IMP will be given, an enrichment period consisting of 
a 1-week single -blind (to subjects) active run -in period and a [ADDRESS_1049185]  (Figure 3-1). During the active 
run-in period the trial subjects will receive 500  µg FE 201836 and placebo to assess safety and 
establish that subjects who respond to treatment with FE  201836 are included in the trial (i.e., an 
enrichment design).  
The 12 -week double -blind randomised treatment period of the trial will follow  a response -adaptive 
Bayesian top -down design. Initially subjects will be randomised to: placebo, 500  µg FE  201836 or 
desmopressin (for benchmarking only). When approximately [ADDRESS_1049186] been ran domised to 
the trial, an interim analysis will be conducted  to investigate the efficacy of  500 µg FE  201836 . If 
500 µg FE  201836 is not sufficiently efficacious compared to placebo the trial will be stopped for 
futility. If 500  µg FE  201836 is efficacious additional doses of FE  201836 (doses 50 -350 µg) will 
be opened up for randomisation of new subjects in  order to identify the Minimum Effective Dose 
(MED) and near maximal Effective D ose (ED 85). The ED [ADDRESS_1049187]

interim analyses will take place every [ADDRESS_1049188] interim analysis  eligible subjects will be randomised to one of 8 treatment groups  
(Table 5-1). Each subject will be instructed to take the IMP every night at bedtime with the 
intention to sleep. In order to keep the treatment blinded each subject will receive two medications 
throughout the trial; an oral solution and an ODT , i.e., a double -dummy design will be applied 
because desmopressin is available in an ODT  formulation and FE  201836 is an oral solution (Table 
5-1). 
Subjects will be asked to follow lifestyle changes (e.g. , limiting fluid intake) througho ut the entire 
duration of the trial. In addition, subjects will be asked to complete e-Diary  assessments 
(Section  7.1.1 ) and PRO questionnaires (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) before  and after randomisation  
(Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3). One objective of the present trial is to further validate the NI Diary. 
Therefore, a sample of subjects (from trial sites in the US A) who have completed the trial will be 
invited to participate in an exit interview within 14 days of attending  the end -of-trial visit (Visit  8), 
to record the subjects’ perception of what constitutes a meaningful change in the NI Diary Total 
Score (Section  10.3.1 ).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  3.5 Discussion of Overall Trial Design and Choice of Control Groups  
3.5.1 Trial Design  
The present clinical trial includes a 2 -week period of lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes (e.g., 
limiting fluid intake ) are recommended as an initial treatment in most clinical guidelines , e.g., the 
updated American Urology Association ( AUA ) guideline on the management of BPH 
(McVary,  2011), despi[INVESTIGATOR_765356] ( Weiss,  2013). Excluding pel vic 
floor exercises for bladder -related Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ( LUTS ), which are not part of 
the present trial, there seems to be no evidence that prolonged lifestyle changes, versus the 
proposed [ADDRESS_1049193] subjec ts with nocturia primarily due to the underlying condition of NP driven with 
increased Free Water Clearance (FWC), who will benefit the most from treatment with an 
antidiuretic agent, a 1 -week ac tive run -in period followed by a 1 -week washout period will be 
applied to ensure that drug -responders (defined as subjects with a reduction of nocturnal diuresis 
rate [mL/min] of 20% or more) are identified.  
The ≥20% decrease in the nocturnal diuresis rate  has been established as a relevant marker of 
antidiurectic responsivenes in previous nocturia trials with an active run -in (Lose,  2003; 
Mattiasson, 2002 ). The NUV  is defined as the total urin e volume from [ADDRESS_1049194] is in nocturnal diuresis. The nocturnal diuresis rate  is 
calculated fro m the mean of 3 days NUV  and total time in bed:  
𝑁𝑜𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙  𝑑𝑖𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑠  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒  (𝑚𝐿/𝑚𝑖𝑛 )=NUV  (mL)
Total  Time  in Bed (min) 
The majority of fluid output occurs via the urine, approximately 1500 mL/day, therefore threre is 
no evidence in adult nocturia subjects that the relative change over the time in nocturnal diuresis 
rate ( mL/min  normalised to time in bed ) should be adjusted for body weight and or/body surface 
area which are  both assumed to be constant over a short period of [ADDRESS_1049195] (desmopressin) was a significant predictor for 
subsequent decrease from baseline in the number of nocturn al voids  (Yamaguchi, 2013 ). 
The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of NP can be driven by [CONTACT_765387], which 
based on mode of action will be responsive to antidiuretic treatment, or by [CONTACT_765388] e, which differs substantially in mode of action and is governed by [CONTACT_765389] (ANP) which is directly and indirectly influenced by [CONTACT_765375] -Angiotensin -Aldosterone 
System (RAAS).  
The aim of the active run -in is (after excluding all other  medical causes of NP) to identify subjects 
with increased FWC , which is responsive to V 2-receptor agonism. In addition, safety will be 
assessed in this period with special emphasis on hyponatraemia.

 FE 201836  Trial C ode: [ADDRESS_1049196] will 
receive two medications throughout the trial; an oral solution and an ODT , i.e., a double -dummy 
design will be applied because desmopressin is available i n an ODT formulation and FE  [ADDRESS_1049197] overseas trials  (with desmopressi n) in early 2000 
(Lose,  2003; Mattiasson, 2002 ; van Kerrebroeck, 2007 ). It is therefore reasonable and appropriate 
to use reduction in number of nocturn al voids from baseline as the primary endpoint in this trial.  
Nocturia is one of the primary causes of sleep disturbance and has been shown to impair 
functioning, quality of life, health and productivity, with those experiencing 2 or more voids per 
night reporting significant bother ( Ancoli -Israel, 2011 ). Awakening during the first [ADDRESS_1049198] restorative sleep is more likely to contribute to daytime 
fatigue ( Chartier -Kastler, 2006 ). The clinically relevant benefit (for the subject) of desmopressin 
treatment may be demonstrated further by [CONTACT_765390] ( FUSP ), 
which reduces  the time spent in slow wave (deep) sleep ( Bliwise, 2015 ). Therefore it is reasonable 
to include FUSP as an endp oint in the present trial . To further evaluate the clinical benefit of 
FE [ADDRESS_1049199] of nocturia and its treatment on subjects’ quality of life and daily lives will 
be documented by [CONTACT_2224] a n e-Diary which contains a 3-day voiding diary, NI Diary and PRO 
questionnaires. Voiding diaries are standard tools use d within the urology area 
(Holm -Larsen,  2009) and  are among the best possible means of obtaining objective data on 
subjective  symptoms ( Abrams, 1983 ). A voiding diary therefore represents a self -monitoring daily 
record of the individual’s voiding behaviour. The ICS recommends inclusion of voiding diaries in 
clinical assessment of subjec ts with LUTS  (Abrams,  2002). The subjects will be asked to complete 
voiding diaries over [ADDRESS_1049200] been shown to be as effective as 7 -day diaries with the 
potential for better accuracy ( Dmochowski,  2005). 
The NI Diary, is a 12-item PRO measure assessing t he impact burden associated with nocturia 
(Holm -Larsen, 2014 ). The NI Diary has been developed and psychometrically evaluated in patients 
with nocturia, in line with published International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL)

• The treatment should be interrupted during acute intercurrent illnesses characterised by [CONTACT_765393]/or electrolyte imbalance (such as systemic infections, fever, gastroenteritis)  until the 
subject has fully recovered. The treatment can be re-started at the discretion of the 
investigator once the condition of the subject is stabilised  
Subjects will be reminded to follow instructions regarding lifestyle changes throughout the duration 
of the trial.  
Subjects participating in the present trial  should refrain from donating blood or sperm throughout 
the trial period.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_1049218]-menopausal is defined as amenorrhea 
of >[ADDRESS_1049219] menstrual period.  
In the context of this trial,  acceptable effective method s include:  
• Transdermal patch  
• Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception  
• Placement of an intraute rine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)  
• Barrier methods of contraception: condom or o cclusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault 
caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
• Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentati on of the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate)  
• True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject  
Periodic abstinence (cale ndar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides onl y, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable  
methods of contraception. Femal e condom and male condom should not be used together.

sponsor  
• Other medical or sa fety reasons, as judged by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator and/or the sponsor  
• The subject wishe s to discontinue for any reason  
A subject  has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason, without the need to 
justify his/her  decision. However, the i nvestigator should record the reason for the subject’s 
withdrawal, if possible. The investigator also has the right to withdraw a subject . Since an excessive 
rate of withdrawals can render the trial devoid of meaning,  unnecessary withdrawal of subjects 
should be avoided.  
Every effort should be made to invite subjects withdrawn/discontinued from  the trial to an end -of-
trial v isit (Visit  8) as so on as possible after a decision of withdrawal/ discontinuation has been taken. 
For any discontinuation, the investigator should obtain the required information and document the 
date and reason for  the premature discontinuation in the eCRF.  
In case the subje ct has withdrawn consent, no new data can be recorded in the  eCRF. Correction of 
previous data and/or recording  data related to visits/procedures done prior to but made available 
after withdrawal of consent (e.g. , laboratory results) will be allowed unless  the subject disapproves 
it. 
If the reason for withdrawal is an adverse event, the specific event or the main laboratory 
abnormality must be recorded in the eCRF. The investigator should  make thorough efforts to 
document the outcome.  
Subjects discontinued from the trial will not be replaced , except for subjects randomised to 
treatment with  500 µg FE  201836 in case a decision is taken to decrease the maximum dose of

The investigator will ensure that the IMP is stored under appropriate conditio ns in a secure location 
with controlled access. The storage temperature shall be monitored regularly and documented in 
accordance with the instructions provided by [CONTACT_456]. Deviations in storage temperature must 
be reported to the sponsor as instructed  in the IMP handling instruction.  
Returned IMP from the subjects (used/partly used o r unused , including empty packag ing material)

5.5 Blinding/Unblinding  
5.5.[ADDRESS_1049225] Treatment   
An emergency unblinding procedure will be available for the investigator a nd designated personnel  
at the s ponsor  through the eCRF . It is the investigator’s responsibility to decide whether it is 
medically necessary to know which IMP the subject receives (i.e., unblinding) to ensure the 
subject’s welfare and safety. Breaking of the blind for individual subjects in emergency situations is 
only permitted in case of a S uspected Unexpected Serious Adverse R eaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) , or in case 
of an adverse event where the knowledge of the IMP administered is required for medical 
management of the subject.  
As far as the emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by [CONTACT_458236]. The investigator who unblinds a treatment will use the  eCRF and is required to enter a 
password and must record the reason for unblinding before the treatment code can be broken. It 
must also be recorded in the eCRF when , and by [CONTACT_20898] , the code was broken. The investigator 
must record the event of unblinding i n the subject’s medical record , including the r eason for 
unblinding.  
If the s ponsor needs to unblind a treatment, the eCRF  will be used for unblinding . It is a 
requirement to enter a password and the reason for unblinding before the treatment code can be 
broken. It must also be recorded in the eCRF when and by [CONTACT_2185].

The IMP will be handled by [CONTACT_765395].  
The IMP  for the active run-in will only be dispensed to subjects wh o meet the eligibility criteria at 
Visit 2. 
The IMP for the randomised treatment  period will only be dispensed to subjec ts wh o meet the 
eligibility criteria at Visit 4 and are randomised into the trial .  
The investigator (or his/her design ee) will maintain a Drug Dispensing Log detailing the dates and 
quantities of IMP dispensed to, and used by  [CONTACT_6992], as well as the batch number (s).  
Each subject should return all unused and used IMP bottles and ODT blister sheets (empty foils) to 
the trial site. The delegated designee at each trial site will reconcile all used and unused IMP and 
maintain  all IMP (including empty bottles and ODT blister/foils) for drug accountability.  The 
monitor will verify the drug accountability during the trial.  
5.6.2 Assessment of Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be verified at Visits 3, 5, 6,  7 and  8, by [CONTACT_765396], partly used 
and unused IMP and/or subject’s statements  documented in the source documents in  case the IMP  
is lost.

After randomisation  (Visit  4) each subject has to complete four  3-day voiding diaries prior to the 
scheduled trial visits.   
Nocturnal voids are defined as the voids occurring from [ADDRESS_1049245] nocturnal void.  
The s ponsor will provide the subjects with cups for measuring the  urine volume.  
Prior to each visit the subjects will receive reminders to complete the e -Diary.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nocturia Impact Diary  
Nocturia has wide -ranging implications for patients’ quality of life, mainly through persistent, 
repeated sleep interruptions. Valid patient self -reported assessments of disease burden and benefit 
of therapy are essential to evaluate the full clinical value of treatment for the patient.  
The NI Diary is a validated, nocturia -specific tool available in multiple languages  and consists of a 
12-item questionnaire with 11 core items (Q1 -Q11) and an ove rall QoL impact question (Q12) 
(Holm -Larsen, 2014 ). It is used in conjunction with a v oiding diary to capture patient reported 
consequences of nocturia and its treatment. It has a recall period of one night and day. Responses 
are scored from 0 to 4 (lowest to highest impact). For Question 12, response options range from 
0 (not at all) to  4 (a great deal). The NI Diary total scores are calculated by [CONTACT_10621] [ADDRESS_1049246] scores are standardised from 0 to 100 (lowest to 
highest impact).   
The NI Diary will be included in t he e-Diary (Section  7.1.1 ), which will be completed by [CONTACT_205504], for the [ADDRESS_1049247] prior to scheduled visit s as outlined in Figure 3-2 
and Figure 3-3. The NI D iary should be completed in the evening and before completing the PGI-S 
and PGI -I questionnaires . 
One objective of this trial is to further validate the NI Diary,  as well as to establish what constitutes

The PRO instrument s (questionnaires) that will be used in the trial  are listed below. They should be 
completed in the following order : 
• At home in the evening  (after completion of the NI Diary) : 
o Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) 
o Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI -I) 
• At the trial site: 
o Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
o Bother ( Hsu 5-point Likert Bother Scale)  
The two PRO questionnaires that will be completed at the trial site (ISI and Hsu 5 -point Likert 
Bother Scale) are recommended to be completed before any other assessments are performed, by 
[CONTACT_2181] a quiet place without influence from the trial personnel or accompanying family or

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Patient Global Impression of Severity and Patient Global Impression of Disease 
Improvement  
Patient Global Impression of Disease scales are commonly used measures of symptom severity, 
treatment response and the efficacy of treatments ( Yalcin,  2003). The P GI-I and PGI -S will be 
included in the trial to indicate change or stability in global health status for anchor -based analyses 
to identify thresholds for clinically important change s in, e.g., NI Diary scores  and number of 
nocturnal voids, as described in a separate Psychometric Analysis Plan (PAP) . Moreover, b oth 
scales will be analysed for treatment effect , as described in Section  9.7.[ADDRESS_1049248] the 
current condition, the revised and patient -tested versions of PGI -I and PGI -S will refer to ‘night -
time voiding’, as compared to ‘LUTS’ ( Viktrup, 2012 ). 
The PGI -S is a prospective measure that measures a patient’ s current severity reported as “None,” 
“Mild,” “Moderate,” or “Severe” ( coded as 1 -4). Scores on this measure will provide a patient -rated 
summary of the severity of the patient’s nocturia  symptoms . 
The PGI -I is a retrospective measure. It will provide a p atient -rated summary of change in nocturia 
since the start of trial treatment , reported as “Very much better,” “Much better,” “A little better,” 
“No change,” “A little worse,” “Much worse,” or “Very much worse,” (coded as 1 -7). 
PGI-S followed by  [CONTACT_380440]-I will  be completed by [CONTACT_765403] , as outlined in  Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3.

life. Sleepin ess has also been linked to increased risks for accidents, such as falling asleep while 
driving or work -related accidents ( Asplund, 2005 ; Ancoli -Israel, 2011 ).  
Nocturia is characteris ed by [CONTACT_765405] . The first sleep period is of high importance due 
to that deepest stages of sleep (most restorative sleep) typi[INVESTIGATOR_765360] (e.g. , to void ) patients are not able 
to make up for this during the rest of the night ( Bliwise, 2015 ). FUSP will be a secondary endpoint 
in the trial.  
Sleep quality will be measure d through the ISI, which is an instrument to quantify the  subject's 
perception of his/her insomnia severity. The ISI targets the subjective symptoms and consequences 
of insomnia as well as the degree of concern or distress caused by [CONTACT_765391] ( Bastien, 2001 ). 
The ISI comp rises of four `sleep -related' items and three `wake -related' items assessing the severity 
of sleep -onset and sleep maintenance difficulties (both nocturnal and early morning awakenings), 
satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily func tioning, noticeability of 
impairment attributed to the sleep problem  and degree of distress or concern caused by [CONTACT_620792]. Each item is rated on a [ADDRESS_1049250] before 
active run -in period (Visit  2), at the  randomisation visit (Visit  4), after 4 weeks (Visit  6), after 
8 weeks (Visit  7) and at the last trial visit after 12 we eks of treatment (Visit  8) as illustrated in  
Figure 3-2 and Figure 3-3. Since the ISI has a two -week recall, a reminder to think back two weeks 
will appear on the screen upon start of completion , in order to improve on quality  of the 
information captured . The ISI will be completed at Visit 2 in order to compare insomnia severity to 
other diseases presenting with insomnia, as recorded by [CONTACT_72244]. The ISI completed at the remaining 
visits (Visits  4, 6, 7 and  8) will be used to measure treatment effect.

mental health, fatigue, etc. ( Tikkinen, 2010 ). It has been shown that most nocturia patients are not 
very bothered by [CONTACT_765406], but that there is clearly a bot her threshold at two voids or more. 
Moreover, comparing two adjacent voiding categories at a time, the increase was statistically 
significant with each increment in number of nightly voids. To further assess the change in 
subjective bothersomeness of noctu ria, trial participants will be asked, “How much has this 
frequency of night -time urination bothered you?” with response options including “not at all,” 
“slightly,” “moderately,” “quite a bit,” and “extremely.” This 5 -point Likert  scale has previously 
been used in a large epi[INVESTIGATOR_119262]  (Hsu, 2015). 
The Hsu 5-point Likert Bother Scale  will be completed by [CONTACT_765407] (Visit  4), after 1 week (Visit 5), after  4 weeks (Visit  6), after 8 weeks (Visit  7) and at

Blood samples for analysis of serum sodium will be collected , preferably in the morning,  at 
Visits  1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, as presented in Table 6-1. The risk for subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_765361]  (serum monitoring plan) : 
Screening (Visit  1) 
All subjects must have normal serum sodium (≥13 5 mmol/L) at screening  (Visit 1). If the serum 
sodium value is <135  mmol/ L (re-tested  and confirmed , with results available within 7  days) the 
subject must be discontinued from the trial as a ‘screening failure’.  
Active Run -in Period  
During the 1 -week active run -in period, 4 days (±1 day) after the planned start of IMP treatment, 
the subject will be telephoned to follow -up on safety . 
Visit 3 
At Visit  3 (after the active run -in), if the serum sodium value is <130  mmol/L the investigator must 
immediately contact [CONTACT_765409]. If the serum sodium 
value is <130  mmol/L (re-tested  and confirmed , with results available within 7  days)  the sub ject 
will not be randomised to the  trial and must be discontinued from the trial as a ‘ screening failure’. 
The subject will be followed (by [CONTACT_093]) for safety until the serum sodium level is stable 
and not clinically significant, preferably until  at least ≥135  mmol/L.  
If the subject cannot attend Visit  [ADDRESS_1049253] is taking IMP . 
12-week Random ised Treatment Period  
During the 12  weeks randomised treatment period, any unexpected low serum sodium value  
(<135  mmol/L or a drop in serum sodium level >10 mmol/L) must be re -tested with at least 
2 additional consecutive tests to identify the nadir and d uration of the hyponatraemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The 
serum sodium level should be re -tested within 5  (±2 days) since the previous test. The subject will 
be followed (by [CONTACT_093]) for safety until the serum sodium level is stable and not clinically 
significant , preferably until at least ≥135  mmol/L.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  Any Time Point during the Trial  
If the serum sodium value is ≤125  mmol/L at any time point during the trial, the treatment with the 
IMP must be stopped immediately and the subject must be withdrawn from the trial.  All cases  of 
serum sodium values ≤125  mmol/L will be reported a s Serious Adverse Event  (SAEs ) 
(Section  8.5). The subject will be followed (by [CONTACT_093]) for safety until the serum sodium 
level is stable and not clinically significant, preferably until at least ≥135  mmol/L.  
Acute Intercurrent Illness  
In case of acute intercurrent illnesses characterised by [CONTACT_765410]/or electrolyte imbalance (s uch as 
systemic infections, fever, gastroenteritis), the treatment with IMP should be interrupted until the 
subject has fully recovered. The treatment can be re -started at the discretion of the investigator once 
the condition of the subject is stabilised.  
In addition, subjects may be called in for additional unscheduled visits due to safety reason, as 
described in Section  6.8. 
Additional Serum Sodiu m Testing  
Events that will trigger additional serum sodium testing include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
• If more than [ADDRESS_1049254] be re-tested, with results available 
prior to Visit  2. 
• A subject is presenting with signs or symptoms of hyponatraemia  (e.g., headache, dizziness)  
• A subject has gained more than 2 kilograms in body weight between visits (Section  7.2.4 ) 
• If concomitant treatment with therapy that may induce hyponatraemia (Section  4.3.1 ) is 
initiated or dosing of an existing therapy is increased during the trial, additional serum 
sodium monitoring should be performed in the first week (4 -8 days) after initiation and 
again wi th follow -up as judged by [CONTACT_093], at least at 4 weeks . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  von Willebrand Factor and Factor VIII  
Blood samples for assessment of coagulation factors will be collected  at Visits  1, 4, 6 and 8 . 
The concentration s of the coagulation factors von Willebra nd Facto r (vWF) and Factor VIII (FVIII)  
were assessed in the phase  1 clinical trial , 000195 , after both oral and intravenous administration of 
FE 201836. The results indicated that  both v WF and F VIII were increased at high plasma 
concentration s of FE  201836. vWF started to increase at a plasma concentration of ap proximately 
150 pg/mL FE 201836  and FVIII at a plasma concentration of approximately 200  pg/mL . Such high 
plasma concentrations are unlikely to be reached in the urological doses proposed for t he present  
trial, however,  vWF and FVIII will be  measured as a safety precaution, and to  ensure  that these 
coagulation factors are not released in clinically significant amounts.

Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections.  
Adverse Event  
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.  
If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between 
the events, the adverse events should be re corded  separately. If an adverse event changes i n 
intensity, a worst -case approach should be used when re cording  the event, i.e. the highest intensity 
and the longest duration of the event.a 
Note the following: A procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the procedure is. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765363]; the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184996]. Death is not an adverse 
event, but the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an 
adverse event).  
Date and Time of Onset  
The date of onset is the date when t he first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted . If the adverse 
event is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test  or outcome of an examination , the onset 
date is the date the sample was taken  or the examination was performed .  
Intensity  
The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following  3-point scale:  
Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.  
Moderate:  Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing).  
Severe:  Inability to work or pe rform usual activiti es (unacceptable).  
                                              
a  Exception: if an adverse event with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre -treatment adverse 
event) worsens in intensity, this must be recorded as two separate events. The initial adverse event should be 
recorded with outcome “not recovered ” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The 
second adverse event should be recorded with date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

adverse event if it:  Guidance  
results in death  Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_1049267] always be exercised and when in doubt the case should be 
considered serious (i.e., if case fulfils the criterion for a medically important event). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] s for administrative  or social purposes do not constitute an SAE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not 
considered adverse events, if the illness or disease existed before the subject was 
enrolled in the tria l, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the trial.  
results in persistent or 
significant

is a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect  Congenital anomaly/birth defect observed in any offspring of the subject conceived 
during treatment with the IMP.  
is an important medical 
event  Important m edical events are events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73250]. 
Examples of imp ortan t medical events include adverse event s that suggest a 
significant hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of malignancy or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgement 
should be exercised in deciding whether ev ents qualify as medically important . 
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious agent 
via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g.,  prion protein 
transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalop athy), pathogenic or non -
pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent 
may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an 
infection in a subject exposed to a medicinal product.

The Global Biometrics Department at  Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S will be responsible for data 
management, the Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP)  and the statistical analyses, production of tables, 
listings and figures. This section outlines the planned statistical analysis of the primary endpoint 
and the planned statistical analyse s for the secondary endpoints. All analyses and further 
description of the statistical methodology for primary as well as secondary endpoints will be 
detailed in the SAP . The SAP will be available before  the first  interim analysis.  
The analysis concerning the psychometric validation of the NI  Diary is p rovided  in a separate  PAP.  
9.1 Operating Characteristics  
The operating characteristics and associated power are estimated for different dose -response 
scenarios by [CONTACT_765418] l Simulator (FACTS) 
version  5.6. The five sigmoidal  dose-response profiles that were used to simulate trial data are 
illustrated in Figure 9-1. Further details on the dose -response model an d the associated primary

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  The longitudinal data profile used in the simulations is based on pooled data from desmopressin 
clinical trials FE  992026  CS40 and FE 992026  CS41 (planned treatment group ). The following 
estimates and assumptions were used : 
• Dose -response standard deviation 𝜎= 0.95 voids  
• A between to total variance (σ2) ratio of 0.90 and a true underlying σ of 0.95  
• Response fractions of 0.8142, 0.9328  and 0.9874 at  Weeks 1, 4 and 8, respectively , as 
compared to the averaged dose -response at Week 12  
• Varian ce fractions of 0.8481, 0.8329 and 0.8900 at Weeks 1, 4 and 8, respectively, as 
compared to the averaged dose -respo nse at Week 12  
Further design specifications were:  
• During the initial 17 weeks the recruitment rate will increase linearly from 0  to 8.2 subjects 
per week  
• After [ADDRESS_1049271] been initiated, the recruitment rate is assumed to 
remain c onstant at 8.2  subjects per week  
• Constant dropout rate of 15% during the randomised treatment period  
• First interim analysis when 125 subjects are randomised , thereafter interim analyses every 
8 weeks  
• Up to the first interim  analysis  the allocation ratio is 2:2:1  for placebo, 500 µg FE 201836 
and desmopressin  
• After the first interim analysis the allocation ratios are 2:7 :1, for placebo, 50 -500 µg 
FE 201836  and desmopressin   
o Subjects randomised  to FE 201836 will be dynamically allotted to

9.[ADDRESS_1049273] the conclusions of the  trial will be rated as major. Major 
protocol deviations will lead to exclusion of data from the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set  
(Section  9.3.5 ). Data up  to the point where the violation occurs wi ll be used in the evaluations.  
Major protocol deviations include, but are no t restricted to, the following:  
• <2 nocturnal voids (average over 3 diaries) prior to Visit 2  or Visit  4 
• NPi ≤33% prior to Visit  2 
• <20% decrease in nocturnal diuresis rate (mL/min) from during active run -in (Visit  2 to 
Visit 3) 
• Maximum voided volume <2 00 mL prior to Visit  2 
• Actual treatment not in accordance with randomised  treatment  
• Significant non -compliant treatment administration and e-Diary completion  
Serious unforeseen deviations deemed to impact the primary endpoint of the trial may additionally 
be rated as major protocol deviations by [CONTACT_765419] a blinded review of data befor e 
declaration of clean -file and lock of database. The list of major protocol deviations will be detailed 
and documented in the clean file document prior to database release  to the trial statistician .

observation of 𝑌4,𝑖~𝑁(𝜇𝑑,𝑖,𝜎2) where the dose -response at dose 𝑑 for subject 𝑖 is adjusted for the 
number of baseline voids ( 𝑥0,𝑖) and assumed to follow a sigmoidal model:

parameters are: 𝛼1 is the placebo response; 𝛼2 is the maximum response; 𝛼3 is the dose (ED 50) at 
which 50% of the maximum effect is obtained; 𝛼4 is the slope parameter.  
The longitudinal aspect of the average change from baseline is captured by [CONTACT_430072] : 
𝑌𝑡,𝑖~𝑁(𝑒𝛾𝑡(𝜇𝑑,𝑖+𝛿𝑖),𝜆𝑡2), 
where the per -subject offset from the mean dose -response is 𝛿𝑖~𝑁(0,𝜏2) and 𝜆𝑡2 represents the

can thus be thought of as being fractions of final value.  
Missing data (missing due to drop -out or final visit has not occurred yet) will be imputed using the 
longitudinal model, assuming missing at random. This implies that als o data from subjects who 
have not yet been observed at Week 12 are used in the primary efficacy analysis, as described in

The following m ain categories of inferential analyse s will be performed for the secondary 
endpoints:  
• Bayesian estimation of the Sigmoidal dose -response curve will follow the analysis 
described in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Prior distributions for primary analysis  are specified in  
Appendix 2 , while prior distributions for secondary analyses will be specified in the SAP. 
The dose -response model for the 50% responder rates will also be further detailed in the 
SAP.  
• Continuous treatment effect s at a certain visit will be analysed using SAS PROC MIXED 
assuming a repeated measures ANCOVA. (A non -parametric dose -response curve is 
assumed.) The changes from baseline per visit will be regressed upon the baseline 
observation as covariate  and treatment, vi sit and treatment -by-visit interaction as factors. An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used for the random subject effect. Least square 
mean estimates of the changes from baseline  and the treatment contrasts (with associated 
95% confidence interva ls) versus placebo will be tabulated and the changes from baseline 
will be graphically illustrated. Should only one post -baseline visit be obtained for an 
endpoint , an ANCOVA will be performed  without the visit and treatment -by-visit 
interaction terms . 
• Correlation between endpoints will be reported using Pearson correlation coefficients and 
partial correlation where applicable.  
• Binary endpoints such as “responder status ” at a certain visit will be analysed using SAS 
PROC GENMOD with the logit as link functi on for the responder probability. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed for the repeated responder status which will 
be adjusted for baseline value as covariate and treatment, visit and treatment -by-visit 
interaction as factors.  (Associated wit h e.g. , responder analysis in terms of reduction in 
number of voids, cumulative distritubtion function plots of percentage change from baseline 
by [CONTACT_765427].)  
Table 9-4 presents  the planned analys es. 
Illustration of the therapeutic window is described separately in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and safety related 
endpoints are further described in Section  9.10. 
Explorati ve gender analyses are planned for all endpoints . For these the following are noted:  
• Estimates of the gender specific dose -response during 12 weeks of treatment will follow the 
analysis described in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  by [CONTACT_765428]. 
Possible differences between the gender specific models will be investigated.  
• Regression models will include gender and gender -by-treatment as  factors. (Possible 
differences between the treatment effects on gender will be evaluated by [CONTACT_765429] -by-treatment.)  
Correlation analyses will be done separately for each gender.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDE NTIAL  The dose -response model will be fitted across all doses, i.e., 0 -500 µg, but inference will be made 
only on the doses that remain op en to randomisation e.g., 0 -350 µg. That is, the MED and ED 85 
doses and the inferences with regards to proof -of-concept and futility will be limited to the dose 
range (i.e., with a maximum dose of 350  µg FE  201836).  
9.11.2  Interim Efficacy Analyses  
The planned interim analys es will be conducted by [CONTACT_701805]  (Section  3.4) according to a 
separate DMC  charte r, which will be established before the first interim analysis . The interim 
analyses will use unblinded efficacy data to infer whet her to stop early for futility or to continue the 
trial as planned .  
At the first interim analysis the trial may be stopped due to futility if there is a low probability (less 
than 10%) that [ADDRESS_1049290]  0.3 voids more efficacious than placebo:  
Pr(𝜇𝑀𝐴𝑋 −𝜇𝑃𝑙𝑏<−0.3)<10% . 
Up to the first interim analysi s (conducted when [ADDRESS_1049291] been  randomised ) the allocation 
ratio is 2:2:1 for placebo, 500 µg FE 201836  and desmopressin. Should the trial continue, the 
allocation ratios will be  changed to 2:7:1 , where all doses of FE  201836 ( 50-500 µg ) are opene d for 
response -adaptive allocation. The randomisation probabilities for each dose of FE  201836 will be 
proportional to the average of I(dose is MED) and I(dose is ED 85), where I(target)  is the square root 
of the probability that “dose is target” scaled by [CONTACT_765434].  
The remaining interim analyses are planned to occur every 8 weeks as depi[INVESTIGATOR_765370] (Figure 9-2).  
These interim analyses will re -iterate the (overall) futility criteria at the 5% threshold:  
Pr(𝜇𝑀𝐴𝑋 −𝜇𝑃𝑙𝑏<−0.3)<5% (see Table 9-2 for interpretation).  
At the final analysis (when all subject s have had their 12 -week visit, or discontinued prior to this 
visit) Proof -of-Concept is established if Pr(𝜇𝑀𝐴𝑋 <𝜇𝑃𝑙𝑏)>97.5%.

10.1 Source Data and Source Documents  
Source Data – International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH ) Definition  
Source data are defined as all information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_95937], observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data ar e contained in source documents (original 
records or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  
Source Documents - ICH Definition  
Source documents are defi ned as original documents, data  and records (e.g. , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, labora tory notes, memoranda,  subject  diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_164372], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic med ia, x-rays, subject files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial).  
Trial -specific Source Data Requirements  - The Sponsor  
No specific protocol data can be recorded directly in  the e -CRF without a prior written or electronic 
record.  The data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent 
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The e -Diary data is part of a 
process where the subject uses the e -Diary to transmit data to the service provider’s database, hence 
the service provide r’s database is considered to be the source data. The  investigator may need to 
request previous medic al records or transfer records, current me dical records must also be 
available.   
For each subject e nrolled, the investigator must document  in the  subject’s medical record,  that the 
subject participate s in this trial and at least the following information  must be recorded : 
• Documentation of signed a nd dated informed consent  
• Subject’s name [CONTACT_18131]  
• Confirmation of participation in the trial (trial identification, screening/randomisation 
[subject] number)  
• Eligibility of participation in the trial (inclusion/exclusion)  
• Relevant medical history  
• Nocturia medical history or subject -reported nocturia symptoms  
• Visit Dates  
• Results of any examinations/tests and assessment performed

perception o f change  in NI Diary Total Score as captured in exit interviews (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Details of these analyses are  described in a  separate PAP . The  order of these three e-Diary 
assessments , all completed at home, should therefore be NI Diary first, PGI -S second and PGI -I 
last, as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Validation through Exit Interviews  
A sample of subjects (from trial sites in the US A) who have completed the trial will be invited to 
participate in a n exit interview within 14 days of attending the end -of-trial visit (Visit 8). Signed 
informed consent must have been obtained through the ICF for the trial, as appropriate, before 
participation in the exit interview.  
The exact size of the sample will depend on when saturation has been reached. The subjects 
included will be proportionate to t he clinical trial sample distribution with respect to demographic 
and clinical characteristics. The investigator at the trial site will be asked to complete a Case Report 
Form that includes specific requirements for recruiting subjects to ensure the correc t mix of 
subjects.  
The exit interview  is designed  to examine the impact of living with nocturia and to assess what a 
meaningful positive change would be from the subject’s perspective in terms of this impact . In the 
exit interviews, subject s’ ratings and perceptions of changes will be collected using qualitative  and 
quantitative methods. These data will be used to aid in understanding what is, from a subject’s 
perspective , a meaningful change threshold for indicating positive improvement in the impact of 
nocturia on a  subject’s lif e, as measured by [CONTACT_765439].  
A detailed description of the exit interview is provided in the Exit Interview Protocol, en closed in  
Appendix 1 . 
All exit interviews will be conducted over the telephone by a trained interviewer from

operate with the monitor to ensure that any discrepancies that may be identified are resolved. The 
investigator is expected to be able to meet the monitor during these visits.  
Risk based monitoring will be applied for this trial. The frequency of the on -site monitoring visits 
will be adapted depending on the risk level of the site and workload. Site ris k is based on multiple 
factors including, but not limited to, the quantity of data generated, quality of the source 
documents, unreported adverse events or SAEs and number of protocol deviations.  
The risk -based monitoring and adaptive monitoring strategy, source data verification process and 
definition of key variables to be monitored will be described in detail in the Monitoring Plan for the

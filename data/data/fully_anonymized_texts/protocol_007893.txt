2.) Description of Study  
 
A.  Specific Aims    
Psychotic-spectrum disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, are associated with 
disproportionately high societal costs related to treatment, disability, and morbidity/mortality. Patients' nonadherence to medications and missed appointments undermine the long-ter m management of these 
illnesses, making it difficult to achieve improved quality of life and ultimate recovery. The transition from inpatient to outpatient care confers the highest risk of nonadherence and premature drop out in this population. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_254534] t-discharge being a time of elevated risk, routine clinical settings often lack feasible and 
effective services to support patients' return to the community and reengagement with outpatient providers due to the current system of fragmented care. In the absence of such solutions, up to 50% of patients with psychosis will remain medication nonadherent, the healthcare system will continue to waste over $[ADDRESS_309392] proposes to develop and examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential 
effectiveness of our novel respo nse-adaptive app intervention, Mobile After-Care Support (MACS), to improve 
treatment adherence and self -copi[INVESTIGATOR_254535], in preparation for a future full -
scale clinical trial. We propose to enroll hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] s chizophrenia spectrum disorders prior to 
discharge and provide them with the MACS app to use during the first [ADDRESS_309393] an initial open trial of MACS to refine the intervention.  
Aim 1: Informed by [CONTACT_254583][INVESTIGATOR_20732], we will design the prototype of a new mobile app called MACS. 
MACS combines ecological momentary assessment linked to adaptive, personalized, r esponse-adaptive self -
help strategies informed by [CONTACT_254584] (CBTp) literature on empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported principles for improving medication/appointment adherence and self -copi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Aim 2: We will use an iterative process to refine a new mobile aftercare app by [CONTACT_254585] (n = 20). MACS will be linked with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254536]. We will conduct an open trial using an iterative process of implementing, refining, and re-
implementing the app intervention with a sample of patients  with psychosis  enrolled during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Patients will use MACS in the first [ADDRESS_309394] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_309395]-discharge being a 
time of elevated risk, routine clinical settings often lack feasible and effective services to support patients' 
return to the community and re- engagement with outpatient providers due to the current system of 
fragmented care. Cost, time, and other barriers limit the ability of clinicians to monitor transition problems 
when moving from inpatient to outpatient care. To our knowledge, there are no existing evidence- based 
interventions that are routinely used as a "warm hand -off" of patients from inpatient to outpatient care.  
To date, adherence interventions for psychosis have produced promising, albeit mixed results6-8. The most 
fruitful approaches have drawn on cognitive -behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp), sometimes also 
integrating motivational interviewing and family therapy7,8. These efficacious interventions have been 
delivered in group formats, individually, and sometimes with patients’ families. Most CBTp -based adherence 
interventions have been delivered as part of routine outpatient services and intervention length has ranged from [ADDRESS_309396] useful w ays of 
improving adherence include strengthening communication with providers, increasing motivation to take 
medications/attend appointments, and addressing common adherence barriers. Schizophrenia guidelines10 
state that interventions “behaviorally tailored” to address adherence have shown the most benefit, but that 
there was insufficient evidence to recommend any one specific adherence intervention for schizophrenia. A recent review
[ADDRESS_309397] service delivery methods, the field is turning to an mHealth approach 
as a means of supporting active self -copi [INVESTIGATOR_254537]/appointment adherence. Mobile 
devices, such as smartphones, have become the ideal technological platform for in vivo assessment and personalized interventions delivered via apps. These ecological momentary assessment (EMA) or  ecological 
momentary intervention (EMI)
12 methods reduce risk of retrospective biases in self-reports and can provide 
insights into patients' daily lives that could not be captured at clinic appointments alone. Also, ecological data 
collection can be used to trigger in-the -moment, tailored interventions, delivered electronically, thus reducing 
provider burden.  
Clinical characteristics associated with schizophrenia, such as low motivation and cognitive impairments13, 
may lead to pessimism about the feasibility of EMA in this population. Yet, accumulating research supports the 
short-term feasibility/acceptability of EMA in psychosis using mob ile devices14,15. Various studies show that 
people with schizophrenia accept and can be trained to use EMA wit h compliance rates comparable to those 
of nonclinical populations15-20. Notably, EMA has demonstrated incremental validity over traditional 
retrospective reports in assessing symptoms associated with schizophrenia19,21.  
Most patients, even those acutely ill, have increasing familiarity with this technology22. For example, 81.4% 
of patients with severe mental illness (SMI) surveyed over the past [ADDRESS_309398] reported smartphone ownership in psychiatric populations of 62.5% in 
201424, which is comparable to rates found in the general public. Further, national data indicate that 
smartphone use is particularly prevalent among ethnic minorities and lower -income individuals as this is the 
most feasible method for them to access the internet25.  
There is a growing body of research showing that various mobile approaches can support copi[INVESTIGATOR_254538]; although none of these interventions has been designed to suppor t patients' return to the community immediately following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For instance, 
Granholm et al.
[ADDRESS_309399] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.2  Page 4 of 18 sample (n=33) of patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder already engaged in outpatient treatment 
groups. Patients used the mobile device 86.5% of days (average 5.2 times per day) and showed improvements 
in psychotic symptoms and depression. More recently, Ben -Zeev et al.27 examined use of an EMI in 342 
individuals with psychotic disorders recruited within 60 days of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (but not directly at inpatient through discharge) and followed them for up to 6 -months. This naturalistic study found that 44% of the sample 
used the intervention an average of 4.3 days per week.  
We conducted a previous assessment only mobile study to assess the feasibility and acce ptability of EMA 
in 65 patients with psychotic -spectrum disorders who were recently discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254539]
28,29. EMA was administered for four weeks via study -provided mobile devices. Feasibility was 
measured by [CONTACT_254586]/retention rates, patients' connectivity, and completion rates. Quantitative a nd 
qualitative acceptability data were collected. Participants completed 28 -31% of offered EMA assessments. The 
only significant predictor of reduced EMA completion was recent cannabis use. EMA completion was 
maintained from weeks 1 to 3 but significantly dropped at the fourth week. Patient acceptability feedback was 
generally positive; negative comments related primarily to technological problems. This was the first study to use EMA in recently discharged patients with psychotic -spectrum disorders. EMA is feasible and acceptable in 
this population, but completion rates were lower than in more stable samples. Future research should 
consider limiting the assessment period, screening for substance use, and integrating assessment with 
intervention elements to i ncrease EMA engagement.  
To maintain stability in patients with schizophrenia requires effective self -management of symptoms and 
consistent treatment adherence. Perhaps the most notable period in the continuum of care when copi[INVESTIGATOR_254540]/appointment adherence are jeopardized is during the first months following discharge from acute 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Various factors associated with adherence have been described in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], and we have 
used these data to inform the development of a theoretically- and empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -grounded, mobile intervention 
app following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Our preliminary findings lay the groundwork for the present project moving from assessment to intervention as we seek to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effe ctiveness of a 
newly-designed mobile app, that we call Mobile After -Care Support (MACS) , to improve the target mechanisms 
of active illness self -copi[INVESTIGATOR_254541]/appointment adherence post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. We plan to 
develop and test the MACS app by [CONTACT_254587][INVESTIGATOR_254542].  
 
C.  Experimental Method  
 
C1.  Brief Description of Subjects  
Participants in this study will consist of [ADDRESS_309400] 
been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254543]. See detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria 
below. 
 
C2.  Study Design 
We will use the Open Trial to assess MACS acceptability/ feasibility. Midway (n=10) and at the end (n=20) of the open trial, the investigator team will meet to review recruitment, retention, and adherence to the 
protocol. We will review patient acceptability/ satisfaction ratings and ease of use of mobile devices as 
measured by [CONTACT_254588]-8 and qualitative interviews. These data wi ll inform refinements in the MACS app that 
will be used in a subsequent study.  
 
C3.  Specific Procedures or Treatments  
 
Mobile Device Procedures  
MACS Protocol . We will use an established mobile software service (ilumivu.com) which provides a secure 
platfor m (Android or Apple IOS compatible) that can be programmed to administer the MACS app. It does not 
require a high degree of IT support and allows for tailoring of content without the need for trained 
programmers. Further, we chose a mobile app that works w ith most smartphones, is easy to download/install, 
and runs largely autonomously. Because we are using a flexible software platform to deliver our mobile 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309401] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_309402] is successful. 
 The MACS app assesses and intervenes by [CONTACT_254589] 
(medication/appointments) a nd self -copi[INVESTIGATOR_254544] (active, planned, problem -solving focused) to reduce 
symptoms and improve functioning. Additionally, MACS will encourage participants who are already reporting adherence and healthy copi[INVESTIGATOR_254545]. MACS app strategies are linked to patients’ specific assessment responses, allowing for 
a highly personalized self -management intervention experience. Primarily, MACS is constructed from common 
components we adapted from CBTp studies, including those testing mobile interventions
16,17 to improve self -
copi[INVESTIGATOR_254546]. The MACS app provides interactive exercises delivered by [CONTACT_254590][INVESTIGATOR_254547]. Exercises will incorporate graphics, feedback, and interactive menus to increase engagement. For instance, participants will be instructed how to use common CBT exercises for copi[INVESTIGATOR_254548]  (e.g., “Is there another explanation for 
what is going on right now? Let’s explore some examples.” or “Try doing what you want despi[INVESTIGATOR_254549]. Let’s practice how to do this now.”).  Another example targeting improved socialization teaches 
patients the benefits of socializing and encourages them to identify and record the names and numbers of support persons in the device that they plan to contact. MACS responses to medication nonadherence and 
missed treatment appointments  come partly from [CONTACT_254627]'s previous traditional and mobile intervention 
work improving treatment adherence in those with SMI30. There are a variety of possible reasons for 
nonadherence. If the reported reason is primarily logistical (i.e., no transportation, ran out of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], for got to 
take them), participants will be instructed to set phone/calendar reminders or contact [CONTACT_254591]. This information will also be conveyed to providers (through periodic reports  generated by [CONTACT_43038] y team  that will summarize app data) so that the community clinic can reach out 
to participants to address adherence issues. If nonadherence is attributed to medication concerns (e.g., does 
not believe medications help, experiencing side effects), we will use previously tested techniques that 
encourage participants to communicate concerns to providers, remind them of costs vs benefits of medication in terms of symptom management, and teach them to engage in other brief problem-solving strategies delivered t hrough the app
30. If appointment nonattendance is reported, similar problem-solving strategies will 
be suggested.  In response to negative affect and stressful life events , MACS provides various CBTp strategies31, 
such ameliorating or circumventing the stressor when possible, or exploring alternative approaches to copi[INVESTIGATOR_254550], including app -based emotion regulation exercises
32. To address low 
life satisfaction, MACS will use CBTp techniques derived from positive psychology research focused  on building 
strength and resiliency33. For example, app interventions will encourage patients to savor experiences, 
cultivate gratitude, and rehearse mental imagery related to previous positive experiences. In addition, if the patient reports positive copi[INVESTIGATOR_254551], the app will deliver exercises that reinforce positive 
behaviors  (e.g., “You seem to doing well. Let’s identify a way to reward yourself for your hard work”) and 
encourage additional goal setting to foster continued improvement (e.g., “You seem to be making good progress toward your goals. Now let’s identify future goals that can build upon what you’ve accomplished so far.”) In response to reported substance abuse , MACS will deliver brief interventions drawn from motivational 
interviewing34,35, another approach in the CBT family, that probes for motivation for change based on an 
individual's self -reflection, consideration of pros and cons, and suggests stimulus control and reduced use 
goals36,37. Finally, safety risk  will be assessed using one item from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (" Since 
the last survey, have you had thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself  in some 
way?"). Because patients ' mobile device data will be uploaded remotely to secure servers, the safety risk item 
will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_3647] . This type of “asynchronous communication” (i.e., a gap 
between patient and provider communication) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_254552]. Patients will be informed that their 
responses will not be reviewed in real time; instead, they will be given immediate instructions on the device 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309403] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.2  Page 6 of 18 for addressing safety (e.g., contact[CONTACT_254592]). Patients will be contact[CONTACT_254593] a 
clinician when needed per study safety procedures.  
 
Mobile Device Use. The MACS protocol will consist of daily prompted sessions. Each session will take ≤ [ADDRESS_309404] month from three daily prompts to once daily for 
months 2 -4. Every morning (9:00am default ), afternoon ( 12:00pm default), and evening (9:00pm default) 
based on the person’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_205004], participants will begin by [CONTACT_254594], functioning, and adherence. Those using  MACS will receive brief self -management CBTp 
interventions that will be adaptively tailored to correspond to responses provided by [CONTACT_2299] (e.g., if 
nonadherence is reported, strategies addressing this problem will be presented by [CONTACT_8121]). The MACS 
morning survey will also remind participants about  being adherent to medications and treatment 
appointments and offer suggestions for staying on track (if adherence is reported) or improving any 
nonadherence behaviors for the upcoming day. We will include a feature that will allow participants to delay 
(e.g., 15 min) the administration of a mobile session, if the participant is too busy or otherwise unable to use 
the device. The prompted app sessions are to ensure use of the program on a regular schedule. In addition, patients will be permitted “free use” of the mobile apps whenever they desire to increase the use of the 
devices based on their personal needs and schedule.  
 
Mobile Software Service. We will use an established mobile software service (ilumivu.com) which provides 
a secure, HIPAA-compliant application (Android or Apple IOS compatible) that can be programmed to 
administer the MACS app. Our Co -I [CONTACT_254628] has experience using this service in his current grant -funded 
mobile research and will assist with app programming and implementation. Responses will be uploaded when 
internet/cellular access is available to a web portal for remote access/downloading from a convenient web 
portal interface. Otherwise, responses are stored on the native app in an encrypted format until uploading can 
occur. App updates and fixes can also be sent remotely to the app when needed. Raw app data will not be automatically sent to providers. Instead, s taff will review mobile data weekly to monitor safety and contact 
[CONTACT_254595]. Patients will be informed that mobile data will not be reviewed in real time 
and that they should contact [CONTACT_39487]/seek immediate help if needed. These risk data will also be included in 
the periodic reports that are sent to providers. Patients will be prompted by [CONTACT_254596] a crisis 
hotline, their providers (numbers pre -programmed into the device), or 911/local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254553].  
 Mobile Device Training/Support. We will employ a master’s level clinician to instruct patients to use the 
app and review patients’ app data post- discharge. After obtaining consent at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (baseline), the 
clinician will help patients install the app on their own smartphone when possible for convenience. If a patient 
is unwilling to install the app or does not own a compatible smartphone, we will supply a dedicated mobile 
device to the participant for this purpose post-discharge and they will return the device at the end of the study. Patients will practice responding to app sessions to familiarize themselves with the program and 
troubleshoot technical problems. Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_254597] -
discharge about using the device.  
 
Communicat ion with outpatient providers.  At baseline, an initial discharge report will be sent by [CONTACT_254598]’ outpatient providers (after obtained releases of information from the patient) based on assessment results. Additionally, to improve quality of care and timely communication between providers, periodic reports (e.g., bi -weekly the first month and monthly thereafter containing information on symptoms, 
safety, and adherence) will be sent to patients’ outpatient clinicians throughout the stu dy to improve care 
coordination. These reports will be generated using data collected via the app.  
 Assessment Procedures (see Table 1)  
 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309405] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.2  Page 7 of 18 Participants will complete baseline measures, as well as diagnostic interviews at intake prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954] (~1.5 hrs). Patients will return to our research office to complete traditional assessments at 1, 2, and 
4 months to assess longer -term effects (~1 hr each).  
 MACS app assessments.  MACS assessment items are adapted from traditional measures and those used i n 
other mobile studies in psychosis: a) affect38, b) psychosis15, c) social support102, d) life satisfaction39, e) 
functioning40, f) treatment adherence41, g) substance use42, h) safety44. 
 Target Mechanisms . Our target mechanisms are increases in: a) medication adherence, b) appointment 
adherence, and c) active self -copi[INVESTIGATOR_254544]. a)  We will employ MEMS45 to objectively measure medication 
adherence during the post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254554]. MEMS 
uses an electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_254555]/closings and the corresponding time/date46,47. Patients 
will be trained by [CONTACT_254599]. MEMS data wi ll be downloaded at our 
research office at follow -up assessments and when patients receive medication refills. MEMS data will not be 
integrated into the MACS intervention and will be used instead for research data collection only. Similarly, pi[INVESTIGATOR_254556]-up purposes. Electronic monitoring is recommended for 
objective adherence assessment
48; MEMS has been used in studies of schizophrenia49, including in our R21 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. b) For appointment adherence, we will use the THI -450, which is a treatment utilization interview, 
to assess mental health appointments missed/scheduled. Medication/appointment adherence will be cross validated by [CONTACT_254600]’ outpatient medical records , and any discrepancies will be re-
reviewed with the patient to obtain an accurate count. c) Copi[INVESTIGATOR_254557] -validated MACS -II
51,52. MACS -II is an interview -based measure that assesses 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 13 core symptoms of schizophrenia, including positive and negative psychotic symptoms, depression, 
cognition, hostility, and euphoria. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_254558] 5 copi[INVESTIGATOR_254559]53, including passive illness behavior (e.g., lying in bed and doing nothing), active problem-solving (e.g., 
professional help seeking), passive problem -avoiding (e.g., isolation), active problem -avoiding (e.g., 
indulgence), and symptomatic behavior (e.g., obeying voices). Research  has shown the MACS -II to be reliable 
and valid when used in samples with schizophrenia54. We also will administer the following: the BARS59 which 
is a interview assessing the patient -reported percentage of missed doses over the past month f or the primary 
antipsychotic medication; the SUS60 which is a 10 item self -report of app usability; the USE61 which is a 30 item 
self-report of app satisfaction; the Brief COPE62 which is a 28 item self -report measure of copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]; and the 
PUQ which is  a self -report measure we created for this study to collect data on participants’ use of mobile 
phones and related technology.

including: a) symptom severity (primary outcome), b) functioning, and c) re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]. a) We will 
use the BPRS ,56 a well -established interview measure of overall psychiatric symptom severity, including 
positive/negative psychotic symptoms, as well as mood symptoms and suicidality; b) the WHODAS -239,40, which 
is a brief self -report measure of functional impairment; and c) rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_254564]-450 as 
described above (and cross-checked with patients’ medical records). In addition, the THI-4 will also be used to 
quantify overall treatment utilization, including the type and amount of menta l health treatment received over 
follow-up (medications, psychosocial, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], pharmacotherapy visits, ER visits, crisis calls, support groups). We also will administer the AUDIT/DUDIT , which measure alcohol/drug use and severity
42,58,64. The 
MMSE63 will be used to assess cognitive functioning at baseline  in order to describe patients’ baseline 
characteristics and to examine this variable as a potential predictor of treatment response in our analyses. The AMBAS
65 is a brief self -report measure of medication beliefs. Acceptability/satisfaction with the mobi le apps 
will be assessed using an adapted version of the CSQ -[ADDRESS_309410] (n=10) and at the end of the open trial (n=20), we will examine development outcomes (e.g., mobile session completion rates, recruitment/retention, satisfaction). We will use descriptive statistics to summarize variables. If development targets are not  met, the research team will investigate and discuss the issue, and 
depending on the perceived reasons for the discrepancy, may modify research procedures to address the issue. For example, if mobile completion rates are low, we will modify instructions or change procedures (e.g., frequency, length, timing) to increase rates. Further, we will calculate effect sizes to characterize changes over 
the follow -up in our target mechanisms of medication adherence (MEMS), appointment adherence (THI-4) and 
active self -copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (MACS -II). We will report clinical significance statistics (number -needed -to-treat/NNT, area 
under the curve/AUC)  to further examine effects. We also will examine effect size changes in primary (overall 
symptom severity=BPRS) and secondary outcomes (functioning=WHODAS -2; rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]=THI- 4).  
 
D.  Material Inducements  
We will compensate patients for completion of in -person assessments ($3 0 each at the baseline, 1, 2, and 4 
month follow -ups, with an additional $20 for returning the electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_254565] a borrowed study phone, if 
applicable,  for up to $140 total), but not mobile device use, to reflec t real world practice.  
 E.   Training of Research Personnel  
The research assistants (RAs) will be directly supervised by [CONTACT_6283]. Gaudiano and Moitra.  All RAs in the 
psychosocial treatment program undergo extensive training in screening medical records (including the 
appropriate permissions to access electronic medical records), approaching patients on the units, obtaining consent to participate, collecting and entering data, and maintaining confidentiality.  All RAs have received training in the informed consent process and their ethical responsibilities when conducting research.  
Additionally, all RAs will receive specific training in the assessment instruments to be administered. Drs. 
Gaudiano and Moitra also will train and supervise the master’s level  clinician who will meet with patients for 
the initial app session before discharge and send brief reports during the study to patients’ community clinicians based on assessment data collected.   
 
3)  Human Subjects  
 
A.  Subject Population  (include number;  gender; age; diagnosis; inpatient vs. outpatient; physical health; 
inclusion/exclusion criteria; rationale for use of special groups)  
 
Participants in this study will consist of [ADDRESS_309411] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.2  Page 9 of 18 been ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_254543].  
 
Inclusion criteria are: (1) currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; (2) DSM -5 criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective based on 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -555 (SCID -5); (3) 18 years or older; (4) prescribed oral antipsychotic 
medication upon discharge; and (5) ability to speak and read English (materials written at a 5th grade reading 
level).  
 Exclusion criteria are: (1) alcohol/drug use disorders at moderate or severe level based on SCID (mild substance use disorders will be permitted); (2) planned discharge to supervised living setting or participation in 
formal outpatient adherence programs (e.g., medication packaging); or (3) pregnancy or other medical 
condition (e.g., dementia  as indicated by [CONTACT_1962]' medical charts) contraindicating use of antipsychotic 
medications.  
 
B.  Recruitment and Consent Procedures  
If the patient appears appropriate based on the routine electronic chart review of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], the 
study will be explained to the patient's treating physician. If the physician agrees it is clinically appropriate, a member of the research team will  then approach the patient. All participants will be asked to provide releases 
of information for their community treatment providers so that the investigators can obtain records to corroborate patient self -report of treatment utilization and send brief reports to clinicians  at follow -up. We 
also will collect the names and numbers of additional contact [CONTACT_254601].  After obtaining permission for this 
purpose, we will contact [CONTACT_254602]/or email  to schedule follow -up contacts and check in with 
them periodically to prompt their  use of the app . 
 C.  Potential Risks   
Potential risks of study participation include: coercion, clinical deterior ation/suicidality, loss of 
confidentiality/privacy, and adverse events (see details below).

Risks.  The risk of potential coercion is judged to be minimal.  
Minimization.  The risk of coercion will be minimized by [CONTACT_254603]. We will fully explain the study procedures, risks, benefits, and alternatives to all patients. Also, 
patients who do not consent or who withdraw at any  time will receive usual clinical treatment with no 
prejudice. Additionally, participant remuneration will be set at modest monetary levels as used in similar studies, including our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732]. We will obtain permission form the patient’s treating physician to ensure that 
approaching the patient for research participation is clinically appropriate.  
 Risk of clinical deterioration/suicidality  Risks .  In this type of population, the risk of clinical deterioration is present.   
Minimization .  Clinical deterio ration, including suicidality will be monitored in multiple ways. 1) During in 
person interviews, study staff will assess for suicide risk, symptoms, and clinical deterioration and take 
appropriate action if needed. 2) The mobile app will contain questions  regarding suicide risk and psychotic 
symptoms in every session, and will prompt participants to contact a crisis hotline, 911, and/or their local treatment provider/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254566]. 3) Mobile device data will be 
uploaded onto secure servers remotely.  As real- time data review is not feasible or sustainable in typi[INVESTIGATOR_254567], mobile data will be reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_254604]/her routine 
monitoring and report -writing duties. This type of strategy is known as asynchronous communication (where 
there is a gap between communications compared with synchronous or “live” communication) and is often 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309412] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.2  Page 10 of 18 adopted in mobile health research. Patients will be informed that their responses will be reviewed periodically 
(not in real time), and that they may be contact[CONTACT_254605].  
If any patient manifests clinical deterioration or psychotic relapse during study assessments or other study 
contacts (based on ratings in the severe range of > 5 for the items assessing psychotic symptoms from the Brief 
Psychiatric Rating Scale), we will either: (1) inform the patient’s clinician, or (2) if the patient is not currently in treatment (at follow -up), we will provide the patient with a referral to a qualified clinician. This also applies if a 
participant manifests significant suicidal or homicidal ideation or risk, and we will take whatever steps necessary  to ensure the patient’s and/or other’s safety. At the time that suicidality and/or clinical 
deterioration is identified, a study clinician will immediately evaluate the participant.  In such cases, research 
staff will immediately contact [CONTACT_254606], Drs. Moitra or Gaudiano, both of whom are licensed clinical psychologists and whom will be on -call at all times. Depending upon the specific situation, 
steps taken to ensure a participant’s safety may involve: (1) escorting the patient to  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s ER for 
evaluation by [CONTACT_254607][INVESTIGATOR_059], (2) alerting inpatient staff to the patient’s 
level of risk, (3) notifying the patient’s clinician, primary care physician, and/or family member for whom we 
have re leases of information, or (4) calling the appropriate police departments.  See adverse events reporting 
procedures below.   
 
Confidentiality and loss of privacy  
Risks . It is possible that a text message or email could be intercepted or sent to an incorrect email address or 
phone number; however t he risk of loss of privacy is judged to be minimal.  
Minimization.  Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_46766], by [CONTACT_254608], by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_46741] , and by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_254568] -protected 
and secure servers. To further minimize risk, all electronic communications will be monitored by [CONTACT_254609], removing all PHI from messages, and transmitting all comm unications 
through a secure server. Text messages will be sent from a phone that is dedicated for use in this research 
study that only research staff have access to. Participant information will be accessible only to research staff. Identifying information  will not be reported.  Study provided phones will be password -protected and 
encrypted. If participants choose to use their own smartphones, they will be encouraged to password protect 
their devices. The app will not be password protected but data is stored  in such a way that information cannot 
be accessed after entered. All data (apps, documents, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], etc.) will be wiped clean from the phone before 
reuse. Only research staff will have access to any email communications and the dedicated study phone. All 
text and email communications will be limited to scheduling research-related appointments or stu dy-related 
reminders, and will not send any messages containing urgent information or protected health information.  
 
Risk of adverse events  
Risks .  In this type of population, the risk of adverse events occurring is present.   
Minimization . Although this population may be at high risk for adverse events, it is unlikely that an adverse 
event will be caused by [CONTACT_67300]. Our proposed interve ntion was developed from empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-
supported cognitive behavioral strategies for people with psychosis and therefore, does not pose the same risks that a pharmacology trial might hold. In the case an Adverse Effect (AE) or a Serious Adverse Effect (SAE) 
related to the intervention were to occur, a written report of the AE or SAE will be prepared for submission to 
[CONTACT_215767], the Chair of the Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39047]. Any such AEs or SAEs will be presented to the full committee of the Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] I RB as soon as it is feasible. The report of such intervention-related AEs or 
SAEs will include whether they were expected or unexpected, a rating of severity of the event, a brief narrative 
summary of the event, whether the informed consent should be changed as a result of the event and whether 
all enrolled participants should be notified of the event. Finally, as part of the annual progress report (noncompeting continuation application) to NIH, we would provide summary information on all AEs and SAEs that have occurred during that year.  
 
D2. Measures to Ensure Confidentiality  
Breach of confidentiality is unlikely because all staff with access to participant data and identifying information have been trained in the management of sensitive clinical information. All data will be treated as confidential, 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309413] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_309414] to ensure research compliance for 
both psychiatric and medical records. Additionally our mobile software service (ilumivu.com) is a HIPAA-compliant platform for the collection of EMA data and secure transmission of those data to a cloud -based 
central server with dedicated d ata backup. Study phones will be encrypted and password -protected and wiped 
clean of data before reuse.  Text messages will only be sent from a phone dedicated for use in this research 
study, and will only be accessible to research staff. All text and email communications will be limited to scheduling research -related appointments or study -related reminders, and will not send any messages 
containing urgent information or protected health information.  
 D3. Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
  1.  Data management and protection.  
Drs. Gaudiano and Moitra will have responsibility for day -to-day monitoring of the quality of operations in all 
data collection. There are several sources of data. Research participan ts will complete questionnaires. 
Research assistants also code all data from research interviews. Only the participants’ study identification 
number will appear on any of the final paper data collect ion instruments. Finally, audio  recordings of 
interviews with participants will be uploaded and stored on a secure server in a digital format. A study ID will be used to identify the recordings. Otherwise, they are not connected with the primary study database in any way.  
 
This study will use Care New England’s instance of REDCap for the collecti on and storage of data. The study will 
not collect or store any actual data within REDCap until the project has been moved into REDCap’s production environment.  REDCap is a secure, web -based application developed by [CONTACT_254610]. It is primarily designed to support online or offline data capture for research 
studies, quality improvement, and operations. REDCap provides easy data manipulation (with audit trails for 
reporting, monitoring and querying pa tient records), real-time data entry validation, and an automated export 
mechanism to common statistical packages. Care New England’s instance of REDCap is hosted within the Care 
New England data center in Warwick, RI. This REDCap instance is role-based an d is fully integrated with CNE’s 
Active Directory structure. It enjoys 24/7/365 enterprise -level support and security inherit to CNE’s HIPAA -
compliant data center. Network transmissions (data entry, survey submission, and web browsing) to and from 
REDCap are protected via TLS 1.2 encryption.  REDCap’s data is stored on encrypted servers within CNE’s data 
center. The REDCap Consortium is composed of thousands of active institutional partners in over one hundred countries who utilize and support REDCap. REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA -Security 
guidelines, and more information about the consortium and system security can be found at http://www.projectredcap.org/.  
 
All data collected by [CONTACT_254611]'s confidential record.  Paper data forms collected from research participants will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  All data will remain confidential. All data is stored on a secure research server, and backed up daily. Patient identifying information will be stored in a separate database and will be password protected in addition to being on a secure server.  
 
 2.  Safety Plan and Adverse Event Identification and reporting  
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309415] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_309416], research staff will ask patients about serious adverse events (as defined by [CONTACT_254612] (OHRP); e.g., inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Second, all study staff will be trained in the OHRP definitions of adverse events that are also 
unanticipated problems; serious adverse events; or unanticipated problems that are not adverse events. All  
study staff are required to report any event that might meet one of these criteria to one of the PIs immediately 
both verbally and in writing. Any report of a serious adverse event will result in one of the PIs contact[CONTACT_254613].  
 
Adverse Events Definitions  
Adverse Event  – any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medical or behavioral treatment or intervention regardless of whether it is considered 
related to the treatment or intervention.  
Expected Adverse Event – an event that may be reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the study 
procedure and is described in the consent form.  
Unexpected Adverse Event – any adverse event which is not described in the consent form and is 
unanticipated.  An event that might have been anticipated but is more serious than expected or 
occurs more frequently than expected, would be considered an unexpected adverse event.  
Serious Adverse Event - (21 CFR 312) include any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results 
in death or the immediate risk of death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153333], 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a congenital anomaly/birth defect (NIH guide-
6/11/99).  
 
Study Definitions  
Specifically, we will consider the following events Serious Adverse Events (SAE):  
a. Death for any reason;  
b. A suicide attempt, defined as any action taken with intent to die, as stated by [CONTACT_254614];  
c. Inp atient psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254569], we will consider the following events non-serious Adverse Event (AE):  
a. Evidence of coercion to participate;  
b. Participant distress resulting in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_254570];  
c. Access of confidential information by a non-authorized person.  
 
Severity  
Each adverse event will be graded in terms of severity: 
a. Non -severe adverse event  
b. Severe adverse event resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
c. Life -threatening adverse event  
d. Fatal adverse event  
 
Attributio n 
 For each adverse event, one of the following attributions is assigned:  
Definite:        Adverse event is clearly related to intervention  
Probably:      Adverse event is likely related to intervention 
Possible:      Adverse event may be related to intervention  
Unlikely:       Adverse event is doubtfully related to intervention  
Unrelated:    Adverse event is clearly not related to intervention  
 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309417] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_309418] a study clinician who will immediately 
evaluate that person. All study staff (e.g., research assistants) are trained in the Psychosocial Research protocol 
for managing suicidality. All clinical faculty in our r esearch group, including Drs. Gaudiano and Moitra  are 
experienced in management of suicidality and other clinical emergencies. Drs. Gaudiano  and Moitra , both 
licensed psychologists, will be available during regular business hours. After hours there is always a licensed 
mental health clinician (psychologist or psychiatrist) available on call by [CONTACT_254615].  
When a clinician is asked to conduct an immediate evaluation, he or she will use our standard guidelines 
for conducting a suicide risk assessment. The clinician will determine whether it is necessary to take immediate 
action to prevent the participant from causing harm to him/herself. If needed, the study clinician may have a 
family member bring the person to Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], send an ambulance, or transfer the participant to the 
Emergency Department at Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the participant is not in immediate danger of hurting him or 
herself, we will take the following actions. First, we will inform the patient about procedures for contact[CONTACT_254616] -harm. Second, with the patient’s permission, 
we will contact [CONTACT_254617]. We will urge the patient to make an appointment with that provider to discuss treatment options. Third, if the patient 
consents, we will speak with one of their family members to ensure that he/ she is aware of the seriousness of the patient’s symptoms and the agreed- upon  treatment plan. We will provide treatment referrals if the patient 
wishes. Regardless of outcome, suicide assessments are always documented in writing.  
Mobile device data will be uploaded onto secure servers remotely.  As real-time data review is not fea sible 
or sustainable in typi[INVESTIGATOR_167697], mobile data will be reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_3647]. This type of 
strategy is known as asynchronous communication (where there is a gap between communications compared 
with synchronous or “live” communic ation) and is often adopted in mobile health research. Patients will be 
informed that their responses will be reviewed periodically (not in real time), and that they may be contact[CONTACT_254618] f urther assessment and assistance as 
necessary.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting . Based on the sources of information detailed above as well as direct patient 
contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or consultation with the scientific team, Drs. Gaudiano and Moitra  will determine if the event is: 
a) an adverse event that is also an unanticipated problem  related to study procedures or intervention; b) a 
serious adverse event; or c) an unanticipated problem that is not an adverse event.  Considering the nature of 
the study and sample, we expect  serious adverse events to occur, including suicide attempts and 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (e.g., due to relapse). However, given the nature of the study, it is unlikely that SAEs will be 
related to the study procedures. The other adverse events that are possible include: inadvertent disclosure of 
protected health information and coercion. If any of these adverse events occur, or any other unanticipated 
events that are identified, the following procedure will be activated: 
              The research staff member w ho observes or is notified of an adverse event will contact [CONTACT_254619]. The MPIs or their designee will complete a Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254571] a level of severity and determine attribution (intervention-related or 
not).   Reporting timeframes will vary by [CONTACT_254620];  
1)     expected and unrelated  SAEs : reviewed by [CONTACT_254621] 14 days 
ascertainment; provided to the  DSMB  in bi -annual data reports;  
2)     unexpected or related SAEs : to Butler IRB and  DSMB  within 10 days of ascertainment;  
3)     all deaths : to Butler IRB and  DSMB  within [ADDRESS_309419] (DSMB)   
The DSMB will be constituted and will be responsible for monitoring the safety of participants and the quality of the data, as well as deciding on the appropriate termination of the study either when significant benefits or 
IRB v. 2016.05.[ADDRESS_309420] recently revised ( 02/15/19 ) 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_309421] been uncovered or when it appears that the clinical trial cannot be con cluded successfully. Members 
of the DSMB include Kim Mueser, Ph.D. (Chair; Professor, [LOCATION_011] University), Louisa Sylvia, Ph.D. (Associate 
Professor, [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and Roger Vilardaga, Ph.D. (Assistant Professor, Duke University) . 
These D SMB members have experience serving on other DSMBs and conducting research on severe mental 
illness and mobile technologies.  
Both MPIs and the DSMB Chair will develop the Data Safety Monitoring Plan. It will then be circulated to 
the rest of the DSMB for f eedback and approval. The board members will review the initial DSMB protocol to 
ensure that it captures the information necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study. The DSMB 
will then receive DSM reports bi-annually. A DSM report will inclu de concerns about significant safety and data 
monitoring issues such as recruitment, retention, and quality of data collected.  
Operating procedures of the DSMB include monitoring the protocol to evaluate the safety of the 
participants as pre-specified in the DSMP of the protocol, monitoring efficacy of the intervention being tested, 
and evaluating performance of the trial, as well as study admission data and protocol compliance. The specific 
content of the reports to the DSM include information about AEs a nd/or SAEs, treatment retention, 
recruitment, reasons for dropout, and interim efficacy data.  
Only reports that meet the criteria of being a death (within 5 calendar days) or unexpected and related to 
study procedures (within 10 calendar days) will be  reported to the DSMB  within the specified timeframe after 
learning of the event. Summary reports of all adverse events will be provided to DSMB in bi-annual reports. Finally, as part of the annual progress report (noncompeting continuation application) to NIH, we would 
provide summary information on all adverse events that have occurred during that year.  
As they deem necessary, the members of the DSMB will evaluate whether the presence of early 
unanticipated therapeutic results, side effects or adverse consequ ences are significant enough to warrant 
amendment, suspension, or early termination of the study and will independently make recommendations to 
the PIs to continue, to amend or to terminate the trial. Recommendations related to the study will be made in 
a written DSMB Report by [CONTACT_164950]'s Chairperson to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_254572], along 
with the DSMB meeting minutes, will be sent to the NIH Project Officer for the study.  
 
E.  Potential Benefits  
The anticipated benefits of the study are twofold: the results will be used to advance understanding of the factors related to aiding patients' transition from inpatient to outpatient services, and to gather significant knowledge about the potentially beneficial role of a mobile device -based aftercare support tool. By 
[CONTACT_254622], participants may benefit from the additional intervention that they will receive. The risks associated with participation are minimal.  
 F.  Risk-Benefit Ratio  
Given the minimal level of risk(s) to the patients as outlined above for participating in the study, and the likelihood that some will benefit from the additional treatment, and the even greater possibility of benefits to the larger population of adults with psychosis transitioning out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the risk/benefit ratio seems 
favorable.

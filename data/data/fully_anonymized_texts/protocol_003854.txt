August 7, [ADDRESS_566724] regimens of hypofractionated radiotherapy.  There will be five groups of patient 
diagnoses: 
• Metastatic melanoma patients who have progressed while on PD-1 or PDL-1therapy 
• Metastatic NSCLC patients who have progressed while on PD-1 or PDL-1 therapy 
• Metastatic & locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients 
• Metastatic Breast cancer patients 
• Other metastatic cancer patients 
 
Pembrolizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks beginning 7 days 
(+/- 3 days) prior to the first fraction of hypofractionated radiation and will continue for a 
total of 6 cycles.  In the initial Safety Phase , there will be two cohorts of patients based upon 
the radiotherapy dose delivered to the index metastatic lesion in the lung, liver, bone or soft 
tissue: 
Cohort 1:  8 Gy x 3 to the index lesion  
Cohort 2: 17 Gy x 1 to the index lesion* 
*Subjects with locally advanced pancreatic cancer will be enrolled only in the [ADDRESS_566725] safety decision-making will be used.  The regimen is 
safe if 0-1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in 6 patients (3 from each strata). Enrollment in a 
cohort will stop if 2+ DLT are observed within a cohort at any time during the safety phase.  
If 2+ DLT are observed in Cohort 1, then Cohort 2 will still be tested. Cohort 1 /barb2right Cohort [ADDRESS_566726] 7, 2017  Page 5

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
4.[ADDRESS_566727] cancer are respectively 4%, 16%, and 25% 
(http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/).  Pancreatic cancer, regardless of stage has a poor 
prognosis, with an overall survival rate of 6.7%. For patients with localized pancreatic 
cancer, survival is 25.8%, with regional disease 9.9% and with distant metastases 2.3%.   
Hypofractionated radiotherapy for oligometastatic disease  
 Hypofractionated radiotherapy for metastatic disease is commonly delivered with 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in which several non-coplanar photon beams are used 
to treat a tumor with a high degree of conformality resulting in little dose to surrounding 
normal tissues.   SBRT has proven to be an effective local treatment for small, localized 
tumors. Initially, it was integrated as an ablative approach with a goal of tumor sterilization 
in oligometastatic disease with minimal morbidity and good long-term clinical outcome in 
these highly selected patients (1-4). Our goal in this protocol is different; we propose to use 
is hypofractionated radiotherapy, either with or without an SBRT technique, to irradiate a 
single lesion in the setting of immune checkpoint blockade with the hope of augmenting a 
systemic response.   
Immunologic approaches to treating patients with advanced stage cancer 
Due to these poor survival rates, many different approaches have been tried for 
patients with advanced stage cancers.  In particular, recent studies have shown benefit from 
immunotherapy. T lymphocytes are prime mediators of tumor immunosurveillance. Several 
immune checkpoint receptors are expressed on T cells that downregulate the activity of these 
cells after they have been activated.  Hence, inhibition of these regulatory molecules is a 
means of augmenting anti-tumor response. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4; 
CD152) is a cell-surface receptor that is expressed (within approximately 72 hours in vitro ) 
on T-lymphocytes in response to the activation by [CONTACT_445655] T-cell receptor (5). CTLA-[ADDRESS_566728] phase 
III randomized trial demonstrating a survival benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma 
treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that blocks CTLA-4 (6).  
Based on this trial the drug was approved for use by [CONTACT_69391] 2011 for patients with 
metastatic melanoma.   
Another immunomodulatory receptor that has garnered a great deal of attention is 
Programmed Death-1 (PD-1).  PD-1 signaling involves binding to several discrete ligands, 
including PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-L1 is often expressed within the tumor microenvironment 
by [CONTACT_445656]-L2 is expressed primarily on professional 
antigen presenting cells (5).  PD-1 negatively regulates the effector phase of the T cell 
response after ligation of PD-L1 to the receptor.  Antibodies that block the PD-L1/PD-[ADDRESS_566729] been used in large clinical trials.  PEMBROLIZUMAB 
is a highly selective, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4) that blocks PD-1.  Its safety 
and efficacy (response rate of 38% by [CONTACT_13407]) have been demonstrated in 
melanoma (7) . Another PD-1 inhibitor, BMS-936558, was found to be safe and to yield 
response rates (by [CONTACT_393]) of 18%, 28%, 27% respectively in patients with advanced stage 
non-small lung cancer, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (8).   
Hypofractionated radiotherapy and immune activation  
 The effectiveness of the immunologic strategy outlined above is contingent upon T-
lymphocyte activation through interaction with the APC having already occurred.  Therefore, 
the development of novel strategies that successfully “vaccinate” patients to their cancer near 
the time of the delivery of the immunomodulatory antibody is an important area of clinical 
research.  One means of potentially increasing exposure of T cells to tumor antigen is to 
expose the tumors to a few large fractions of radiation (hypofractionated radiotherapy).   
There is emerging evidence that radiotherapy (RT) can stimulate the immune 
response, by a variety of mechanisms such as increasing TLR4 expression on dendritic cells, 
increasing priming of T cells in draining lymph nodes, and increasing tumor cell antigen 
presentation by [CONTACT_405] (reviewed in (9)). Recently Verbrugge et al. showed that 
radiotherapy can enrich tumors of functionally active, tumor-specific effector cells (10). Lee 
et al. demonstrated that the therapeutic effect with ablative hypofractionated radiotherapy on 
local tumor control required activation of CD8+ T- lymphocytes  (11).   
Hypofractionated radiation has also been shown to potentiate systemic response to 
immunomodulatory therapy.  A single large dose of RT increased the effects of Flt-[ADDRESS_566730] that was only seen in 
immunocompetent C57Bl/6 mice, not immunodeficient nude mice (12).  Hypofractionated 
radiation has also been shown to amplify immune response to traditional vaccines (13).  
Additionally, there are pre-clinical data to suggest that CTLA-4 blockade along with ablative 
radiotherapy to an index lesion can prevent the growth of a tumor outside the irradiated field 
(abscopal effect) through an immune-mediated effect (14).  
In addition to these pre-clinical data, Postow et al. reported a patient with metastatic 
melanoma having progressive disease while on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445638] a 
course of hypofractionated RT to a painful paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_445639].  The patient received a dose of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445640], and then had radiologic imaging two months after this, 
which showed radiologic regression of disease in the irradiated site as well as in regions 
outside the radiation fields (15).  
4.1.[ADDRESS_566731] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades [1].  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6].  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio 
University of Pennsylvania

 of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_566732] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-
cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2) [7; 
8].  The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved [9].  PD-1 and family members are type 
I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine 
phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the 
dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are 
i
nvolved in the CD3 T-cell signaling cascade [7; 10; 11; 12].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]-[ADDRESS_566733] from that of CTLA-4 as both 
molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [13; 14].  PD-1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T 
regs and Natural Killer cells [15; 16].  Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells [17].  The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed 
or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in 
various tumors [18; 19; 20; 13].  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic 
regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_566734] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 
protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or 
chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation 
in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in 
peripheral tissues [13].  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of 
cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been 
suggested to regulate tumor-specific T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) 
[21].  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
PEMBROLIZUMAB (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective 
humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block 
the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.

 4.2 Rationale 
Current RADVAX™ trial at Penn using hypofractionated RT and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445641] a patient having progressive disease on 
immunomodulatory therapy who had a dramatic abscopal response to radiotherapy, we 
initiated a phase I/II trial at Penn to determine whether it would be safe to deliver ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445642]. Patients received either [ADDRESS_566735] common grade 3 toxicity was anemia. There were no dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs), which for this study was defined as any grade 4 or higher immune 
treatment-related toxicity or grade 3 or higher non-immune treatment (RT-related) toxicity.   
Fourteen patients completed the entire 4 cycles of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (2 patients completed only 2 
cycles and 2 patients only 3 cycles due to progressive disease; 2 patients received only 3 
cycles due to the development of colitis). 
 The impact of the therapy on the irradiated lesion and the non-irradiated lesion(s) was 
evaluated using two standard modalities: (i) 18F-2-deoxyfluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) 
activity on positron emission tomography-computer tomography (PET-CT) as a measure of 
biological effects of therapy and (ii) CT imaging for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST 1.1) assessment. [ADDRESS_566736] in the irradiated 
(“index”) lesion in 9 out of 19 patients (47%) with 4 of these 9 patient showing a complete 
metabolic response (CMR) and 5 of the 9 showing a partial metabolic response (PMR).  Of 
the remaining [ADDRESS_566737] repeat PET imaging, and 3 had stable metabolic 
disease (SMD).  For the lesions that were not irradiated, metabolic responses were seen in 4 
patients (21%), of which [ADDRESS_566738] repeat PET imaging, and 8 had progressive metabolic disease (PMD).  Using 
RECIST criteria on non-irradiated lesions, 4 out of 19 patients (21%) had a partial response 
(PR), 2 patients had stable disease (SD), and 12 patients had progressive disease (PD).  One 
patient did not have CT scanning performed to assess tumor response.  
 The median progression-free survival (PFS) is 4.9 months and the median overall 
survival (OS) 10.7 months. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445643] a response rate of 10.9% in the 
study by [CONTACT_445657]. (6).  In summary, the combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445644].  However, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645]-related side effects were 
significant and the combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445646].  Although our study was not designed to assess response, 
the results do not show that the majority of the patients have significant shrinkage of their 
unirradiated lesions in response to radiation.   The results of our Phase I study support the 
investigation of the anti-PD1 agent, Pembrolizumab, with radiation given its probable

 superior toxicity profile compared to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_226139]. 
Preclinical Studies of RT and anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy   
 RT has also been combined with inhibition of the PD1/PD-L1 pathway.  Deng et al. 
found that PD-L1 was upregulated in the tumor microenvironment after radiation (16). 
Administration of anti-PD-L1 antibody enhanced the efficacy of RT through a cytotoxic T 
cell-dependent mechanism. Concomitant with tumor regression, RT and anti-PD-L1 
synergistically reduced the local accumulation of tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs), which suppress T cells and alter the tumor immune 
microenvironment.  
 Our own group at Penn has generated data using anti-PD1 therapy with RT.  As noted 
above, emerging data indicate that optimal results will require combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], of 
which radiation (RT) may hold promise. The effectiveness and mechanisms of action for this 
combination have not been well characterized, which potentially hinders efficient clinical 
translation. To address these issues, we have developed several pre-clinical mouse models for 
melanoma, breast cancer, and other cancer types to mechanistically dissect the combination 
of RT and immune checkpoint blockade. Using these models, we have determined that RT 
and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 cooperate to promote tumor 
response in both irradiated and unirradiated tumors (Minn, A personal communication). 
Survival and complete responses are significantly improved, and long-term anti-tumor 
immunity ensues. Using a series treatment resistant sublines that we derived combined with 
unbiased genome-wide and immune approaches, we have discovered mechanisms of 
resistance and druggable targets to inhibit resistance. Studies on immune mechanisms and 
biological effects of RT are providing insight into how combination therapy can work in non-
redundant ways to improve response. Insight into immune mechanisms has also driven the 
discovery of potential blood-based biomarkers for response. In summary, by [CONTACT_105028]-
clinical models, our preclinical studies demonstrate that anti-PD1 therapy in combination 
with hypofractionated radiotherapy leads to significant responses in non-index (non-
irradiated) lesions and therefore supports the proposed trial of Pembrolizumab with radiation. 
We plan to continue to address critical questions on which combinations are effective, what 
mechanisms of resistance might emerge, how resistance can be rationally targeted, and 
whether mechanistic insight can guide the development of biomarkers to predict response 
4.2.[ADDRESS_566739] shown activity in melanoma and NSCLC (XX-ref).  It is not clear if 
these agents will have activity in other diseases nor is it clear whether the immunostimulatory 
effect of hypofractionated radiotherapy in combination with these agents is cancer-specific or 
dependent upon single agent activity of the immunotherapeutic agent.  Our preclinical data 
suggest that activity is observed in a broader range of tumor types.  Therefore, we propose to 
study the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of Pembrolizumab and 
radiotherapy in five groups of patient diagnoses:  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, 
breast cancer, and other.  Our hypothesis is that safety will be established and that an 
exploratory analysis will demonstrate robust responses in all disease groups.

 4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent PEMBROLIZUMAB.  The dose escalation portion of this 
trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of 
PEMBROLIZUMAB showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of 
tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has 
been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose 
and schedule utilized in combination with hypofractionated radiotherapy.  Recent data from 
other clinical studies within the PEMBROLIZUMAB program has shown that a lower dose 
of PEMBROLIZUMAB and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement 
and clinical activity. 
 
PK data analysis of PEMBROLIZUMAB administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow 
systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale 
for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
data from [ADDRESS_566740] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in 
exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 
for PEMBROLIZUMAB in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the 
notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose 
regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In 
addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, 
there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Endpoints 
This is a Phase I study and therefore, efficacy will not be the primary endpoint.  Nonetheless, 
we have designed the study to obtain an estimate of the immune-related response rate in non-
index metastatic lesions of the combination of Pembrolizumab and hypofractionated 
radiotherapy (please see statistical section for greater detail. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker Research 
While this is a Phase I study and not necessarily powered for extensive statistical 
evaluation of biomarkers, we will begin to directly test whether promising biomarkers exist 
for more in depth analysis.  The focus on immune-related response rate in non-index 
metastatic lesions will be the basis for examining circulating immune responses for correlates 
of tumor response. 
The main goals of these studies are to perform in-depth immune phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_445647].  Biosamples (blood and, where available, tumor) obtained from 
patients before and at serial time points during treatment will be analyzed.  The primary goals 
for the basic studies with these human samples will be: 
• High dimensional (15-17 color) flow cytometry to analyze T cell subsets (including 
naïve, effector, memory (effector memory and central memory), effector memory 
RA, exhausted, Th1, Treg and Tfh), co-expression of sets of multiple inhibitory 
receptors by [CONTACT_159468] T cell subsets, transcription factor expression, and T 
comprehensive functional analysis (expression of cytokines, chemokines, cytotoxic 
molecules, and degranulation).  These studies will focus on sophisticated immune 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_445648].  These studies will be performed on PBMC and, 
where available, TIL. 
• Deep sequencing of the TCR will also be performed from blood and tumor as a novel 
way to interrogate tumor-specific T-cell responses induced by [CONTACT_3148]. This method 
does not require a priori understanding of a particular tumor antigen or MHC. Of 
particular interest will be evidence of TCR clones increasing in the circulation after 
therapy that are also found in the patient’s tumor. Such observations would be 
consistent with a “vaccine effect” of therapy and the persistence of these T cell clones 
over time may be a predictor of a durable response. 
• Whole genome transcriptional profiling will be performed using PBMC and/or tumor 
to develop predictors of responses and to reveal underlying pathways.  These studies 
will be integrated with findings from pre-clinical models to help define novel 
signatures of clinical responses.

after at least one regimen of systemic therapy (breast, pancreas, and other).  In our protocol,

The PEMBROLIZUMAB dosing interval may be increased due to toxicity as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Pembrolizumab should be administered 7 days (+/- 3 days) prior to the first fraction of 
hypofractionated radiation.  
*NOTE:  Patients who have stable or responding disease and are felt to be clinically 
benefiting from the drug can continue receiving pembroluzimab for up to 2 years. For 
cancers not currently commercially approved for treatment with pembroluzimab, the drug 
will be provided by [CONTACT_44873].   
In the initial Safety Phase , there will be two cohorts of patients based upon the radiotherapy 
dose delivered to the index metastatic lesion in the lung, liver, bone or soft tissue: 
Cohort 1:  8 Gy x 3 to the index lesion  
Cohort 2: 17 Gy x 1 to the index lesion* 
*Subjects with locally advanced pancreatic cancer will be enrolled only in the [ADDRESS_566760] safety decision-making will be 
used.  The regimen is safe if no more than 0-1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed in 
6 patients within a cohort within a stratum. Enrollment in a cohort within a stratum will stop 
if 2+ DLT are observed within that cohort at any time during the safety phase.  If 2+ DLT are 
observed in Cohort 1 in a stratum, then Cohort 2 within that stratum will still be tested.

[ADDRESS_566766] or PET/CT scans (with 
contrast, unless contraindicated) will be required to define the gross target volume (GTV) 
and planning target volume (CTV). The treatment planning PET/CT scan should be acquired 
with the subject in the same position and using the same immobilization device as for 
treatment. Treatment planning will be done using a 3D based CT treatment planning system.  
All tissues to be irradiated must be included in the CT scan. Planning CT scan will be done at 
< [ADDRESS_566767] with sufficient margin for 
treatment planning.  
Target Contouring 
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined as all known gross disease encompassing the 
selected index lesion. The GTV will consist of the index lesion as visualized on CT and PET.   
Internal Gross Tumor Volume (IGTV) is defined for mobile index lesions at the discretion of 
the treating physician. A 4-D CT scan may be acquired in order to account for the motion of 
the lesion during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. The IGTV will be defined as the union of the visualized index 
lesion on all gated CT data sets. 
Planning Target Volume (PTV) will be defined as per the convention for photon beam 
radiotherapy. A 3-dimensional margin will be created on the GTV or IGTV (if available) to 
allow for daily set-up variance.

followed.  For SBRT, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], ≥ 10 beams of radiation will be used with roughly equ al 
weighting. Generally, more beams are used for larger lesion sizes. When static beams are 
used, a minimum of 7 non-opposing beams should be used. For arc rotation techniques, a 
minimum of 340 degrees (cumulative for all beams) should be utilized. For arc rotation 
techniques, a minimum of 340 degrees (cumulative for all beams) should be utilized. In order 
to obtain acceptable coverage, field aperture size and shape should correspond nearly 
identically to the projection of the PTV along a beam’s eye view (i.e., no additional “margin” 
for dose buildup at the edges of the blocks or MLC jaws beyond the PTV). The only 
exception should be when observing the minimum field dimension of 3.5 cm when treating 
small lesions.  As such, prescription lines covering the PTV will typi[INVESTIGATOR_122896] 60-90% line 
(where the maximum dose is 100%); however, higher isodoses (hotspots) must be 
manipulated to occur within the target and not in adjacent normal tissue.

interval by  [ADDRESS_566771] infusion, trial 
treatment should be discontinued after consultation with the Sponsor.  With investigator and 
Sponsor agreement, subjects with a laboratory adverse event still at Grade 2 after 12 weeks 
may continue treatment in the trial only if asymptomatic and controlled.  For information on 
the management of adverse events, see Section 5.6.1.   
Subjects who experience a recurrence of the same severe or life-threatening event at the same 
grade or greater with re-challenge of PEMBROLIZUMAB should be discontinued from trial 
treatment. 
There will be no modification of radiotherapy. 
5.2.2 Timing of Dose Administration 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 
6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to [ADDRESS_566772] 7, 2017  Page 23 
 All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis. 
PEMBROLIZUMAB will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment cycle 
intervals may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Sites should make 
every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, 
given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 
minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). 
The Procedures Manual contains specific instructions for PEMBROLIZUMAB dose 
calculation, reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration. 
5.2.3 Trial Blinding/Masking 
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered. 
5.3 Stratification and Randomization 
During the Safety Phase of this study, patients will be stratified on the basis of having 
received prior immunotherapy (see Table 3).  During the Expansion Phase, patients will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_9548]. If both fractionation regimens are safe, then we will randomize 
patients. Otherwise, all patients will be enrolled on the single regimen determined to be safe.  
Randomization will aid in the preliminary assessment of clinical response by [CONTACT_445661].  The randomization procedure is described in the Statistical Section. 
5.4 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the Sponsor.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the 
subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the subject.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_566773]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, 
frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_566774] dose of trial treatment should be 
recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2. 
5.4.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial: 
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than PEMBROLIZUMAB 
• Additional Radiation therapy beyond that described in the radiotherapy section 
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may 
be allowed after consultation with Sponsor.   
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_566775] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed 
virus vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-
Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
• Glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  
Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically 
necessary. 
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications that are prohibited in this trial. 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 
5.5 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
5.5.1 Supportive Care Guidelines 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  These supportive care measures will be instituted for both 
Pembrolizumab and hypofractionated radiotherapy and include but not limited to the items 
outlined below: 
University of Pennsylvania   
  
 
August 7, 2017  Page 25 
 • Diarrhea: Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of 
enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or 
without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  In 
symptomatic subjects, infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if symptoms are 
persistent and/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should be considered. 
o In subjects with severe enterocolitis (Grade 3), PEMBROLIZUMAB will be 
permanently discontinued and treatment with systemic corticosteroids should 
be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  When 
symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_566776] 1 month. 
o In subjects with moderate enterocolitis (Grade 2), PEMBROLIZUMAB 
should be withheld and anti-diarrheal treatment should be started.  If 
symptoms are persistent for more than one week, systemic corticosteroids 
should be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent).  When 
symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_566777] 1 month.  Regarding guidelines for continuing 
treatment with PEMBROLIZUMAB, see Section 5.2. 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid 
and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. 
• Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of 
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice.  Subjects 
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. 
• Anti-infectives: Subjects with a documented infectious complication should receive 
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti-infective agents as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_110526] a given infectious condition, according to standard 
institutional practice. 
• Immune-related adverse events: Please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] below and the separate 
guidance document in the administrative binder regarding diagnosis and management 
of adverse experiences of a potential immunologic etiology.   
• Management of Infusion Reactions:  Acute infusion reactions (which can include 
cytokine release syndrome, angioedema, or anaphylaxis) are different from 
allergic/hypersensitive reactions, although some of the manifestations are common to 
both AEs.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion 
and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug 
fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness 
of breath); Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise); Headache; Hypertension;

[IP_ADDRESS]  Supportive Care Guidelines for Events of Clinical Interest and Immune-related 
Adverse Events (irAEs) 
Events of clinical interest of a potential immunologic etiology (irECIs) may be defined as an 
adverse event of unknown etiology, associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an 
immune phenomenon.  irAEs may be predicted based on the nature of the 
PEMBROLIZUMAB compound, its mechanism of action, and reported experience with

5.6 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
5.6.[ADDRESS_566781]-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 
methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to 
conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥[ADDRESS_566782] 7, 2017  Page 30 
 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year will be considered 
postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study.  The two birth 
control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal

The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom 
(by [CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents). 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate 
in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the 
duration of the study and during the follow-up period defined in section 7.2.2-Reporting of 
Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]

the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and 
within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, 
abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication 
to the mother or newborn).  The study investigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the 
condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject impregnates 
his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES 
7.1 Trial Procedures 
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275]. 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. 
Study Visit Schedule 
Days -28 to -1 :  Subject will be screened for enrollment in the study.  After the subject is 
deemed potentially eligible for the study and consents, the subject will be seen in the 
outpatient radiation therapy and/or medical oncology clinics for a history, physical exam, 
baseline laboratory studies, correlative studies, scheduling of imaging studies (if needed), and 
scheduling of radiotherapy treatment planning and Pembrolizumab infusion.  Radiotherapy 
treatment planning is a standard procedure and will consist of a simulation CT scan or 18F-
FDG PET/CT or MRI scan as per the Department of Radiation Therapy standards.  The 
simulation will be scheduled so that the subject may begin hypofractionated radiotherapy on

To systematically characterize additional patterns of response in patients with metastatic cancer, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) version 1.[ADDRESS_566812] criteria are applied are given below.  
A maximum of 5 target lesions in total (and up to 2 per organ) can be identified at baseline and measured throughout the course of 
therapy.  In order to be considered a measurable target lesion, a nodal lesion must be > 1.5 cm in short axis diameter (SAD), and an 
extranodal lesion must be > 1.[ADDRESS_566813] diameter (LD).  The irradiated lesion will not be included as a target lesion for 
measurement using RECIST.  The sum of diameters of the target lesions (SAD for nodal lesions and LD for extranodal lesions) is 
followed through the course of therapy.  
Disappearance of all known lesions will be counted as complete response (CR). A reduction of at least 30% in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions is defined as partial response (PR).  Progressive disease (PD) is defined as >20% increase in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions from nadir (including baseline if it is smallest sum).  PD is also defined as unequivocal progression of

Relationship 
to test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product caused 
the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a 
medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required 
regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing 
the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the [COMPANY_006] product and the AE ; 
the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more 
likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE): 
 Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, 
acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or 
measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
 Time 
Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with 
investigational medicinal product)? 
 Likely 
Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other 
drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors 
 
 
Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE:

product 
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the [COMPANY_006] product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced? 
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.

 Rechallenge  Was the subject re-exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product in this study? 
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, 
or (2) the trial is a single-dose drug trial); or (3) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are used only one time). 
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS 
SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_80086], OR IF 
REEXPOSURE TO THE MERCK PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL 
SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED

7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
7.2.6 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB 
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_249924], affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety reporting to 
the Penn IRB. The University of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires expedited reporting 
of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen and indicate that participants 
or others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or 
bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The Penn IRB 
requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days 
from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event: 
• Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non-serious, on-site 
or off-site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_445652]: 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.) 
AND 
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was possibly, probably, or 
definitely caused by [CONTACT_28821].) 
Reporting Process 
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to 
the Penn IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others 
Including Reportable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the event (including a 
description of the event with information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, 
follow-up/resolution and need for revision to consent form and/or other study 
documentation). 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_65036]’s study file.

Protocol/Amendment No.:    
 
 May 3, [ADDRESS_566827] received study treatment/therapy/intervention or was exposed to an investigational 
device. We will not send reports after the 90 day window. 
 
All unexpected deaths or deaths related to the study agent(s)/device(s) will be reported within 
[ADDRESS_566828] study intervention/treatment are not reportable except if the 
death is in house gene or cellular-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], deaths on in-house studies utilizing on-campus 
manufacturing of the study agent(s) or components of study agent(s) and deaths on first-in-
human studies.  
 
A deviation is a one time, unintentional  action or process that departs from the IRB and 
DSMC approved study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospectively , after 
the event occurred. If the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the 
outcome (endpoints) or compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation 
must be reported to the DSMC within 5 business days and the IRB within 10 business days. 
Reporting Deaths:  more rapid reporting requirements 
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes 
the more rapid reporting requirement of the Penn IRB for specific situations: 
• Report the event within 24 hours when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and 
indicates participants or others are at increased risk of harm. 
• Report the event within 72 hours, for all other deaths, regardless of whether the death 
is related to study participation. 
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the Penn IRB may be made by [CONTACT_445665]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a 
follow up to the initial submission. 
Other Reportable events: 
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the Penn IRB: 
• Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
• Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_85400].

• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected. 
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected. 
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value. 
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol. 
• Breach of confidentiality 
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant. 
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the 
study. 
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051]. 
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_445653], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects. 
7.3 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of 
adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data 
and safety-monitoring plan (see section 9 Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse 
events. 
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
This is a stratified phase I trial with 2 phases: a safety phase and an expansion phase. 
Safety Phase: Pembrolizumab is fixed. Two radiotherapy fractionation schedules are tested: 8 
Gy x 3 and 17 Gy x 1. Patients are stratified by [CONTACT_445666]-1 therapy. 24 patients will be 
enrolled, 12 per stratum and 6 per fractionation cohort.

Safety Phase Decision-making: Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined in Sections 2.1 and 
5.2. The regimen is considered safe if 0-1 DLTs are observed in 6 patients within a stratum. 
Stop if 2+ DLT at any time. If 2+ DLT in Cohort 1, then Cohort 2 will still be tested. Cohort 
1 /barb2right Cohort 2 is not an escalation of dose.  
Expansion Phase: Patients are now stratified by [CONTACT_9548].  
• If both fractionation regimens are considered safe for both prior PD-1 therapy strata, 
then we will randomize patients. Randomization will aid in our preliminary 
assessment of clinical response by [CONTACT_445667]. Although unlikely, if only 
one of the fractionation regimens is considered safe for both prior PD-1 therapy 
strata, then  all patients will be enrolled on the fractionation regimen which was 
determined to be safe.

This statistical analysis plan (SAP) provides a more technical and de tailed elaboration of 
the statistical analyses of the effectiveness and safety data as outlined and/or specified in 
the final protocol of Study 1919-610-019 (versi on dated June 1, 2017). Specifications of 
tables, figures, and data listings are contained in a separate document.  
Study 1919-610-[ADDRESS_782360] Patient Evaluation for Dryness (SPEED)  In at least one eye, the participants 
need to meet all of the objectiv e measure in the same eye:   
 
• A basal Schirmer test of ≥  
  
  
  
  
 
• Tear film breakup time (TBUT)  
 
 
The length of this study will be approximately [ADDRESS_782361] udy-related procedures are begun. At the 
Screening Visit, patients who provide written informed consent will be assigned a 
screening number. At the day of randomiza tion (Day 0), patients meeting the entry 
criteria will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to either the TrueTear or moist heat compress 
control treatment groups. Following the initial applicati on of treatment in clinic at Day 0, 
participants will apply the randomized treatment for approximately 30 days.  
Effectiveness and safety assessments will be conducted at the clinic at Screening, 
Baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 30.  
The schedule of evaluations for Study 1919-610-019 is presented in Table 3–1 .

characteristics (wearing contact [CONTACT_592968]) and other 
disease characteristics (Sjogren’s syndrom e) will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_592969]. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_592970] m ean, SD, Q1/Q3, median, minimum, and 
maximum values. Categorical variables will be  summarized by [CONTACT_592971]. A subject listing of demographics a nd baseline characteristics will be provided.

Activities,  version 20.[ADDRESS_782363] dose of study treatment.   
Both prior and concomitant medications will be coded using The Anatomical-
Therapeutic-Chemical classification text from World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary. The use of prior and concomita nt medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_592972]. If a 
patient took a specific medication multiple ti mes or took multiple medications within a 
specific therapeutic class, that patient w ould be counted only once for the coded drug 
name [CONTACT_592975]. Formulations (inc luding salts, esters, etc) containing the same 
active ingredient will be pooled under the coded drug name [CONTACT_592976]. Medications containing multiple active ingredie nts of different coded drug names will be 
reviewed during the study and may be pooled under a single coded drug name 
[INVESTIGATOR_354307]. A subject listing for prior and concomitant medications will be provided.  
The Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical cl assification text from World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary, MAR17 or newer, will be used to classify prior and concomitant medications by [CONTACT_592973].

deviations reported will be provided. A significant deviation includes the deviation coded

The safety analysis will be performed using th e Safety Population. The safety parameters 
will include adverse events (AEs) and other sa fety measurements defined in the protocol 
including corrected distance visual acuity or  slip lamp biomicroscopy findings. For each 
safety parameter, the last nonmissing safety  assessment before the first dose of study 
treatment will be used as the baseline for all analyses. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_592970] m ean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum 
values. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_366844]. 
10.1 ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_169056],  version 20.1 or newer. 
An AE will be considered a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it was present one or after the first applicat ion of study treatment or was pr esent before the date of the 
first application of study treatment and increase d in severity or became serious on or after 
the first application of  study treatment.   
An AE will be considered a treatment-emergent serious AEs (TESAE) if it is a TEAE 
that additionally meets any SAE criteria. 
The number and percentage of  patients reporting TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs in 
each treatment group will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6657], 
separately. If more than [ADDRESS_782365] dose of  study treatment, an intensity of severe will 
be assigned. The imputed values for severity assessment will be used for the incidence 
summary; the values will be shown as missing in the data listings. 
14.6 MISSING CA[LOCATION_003]L RELATIONSH IP TO STUDY TREATMENT 
FOR ADVERSE EVENTS 
[If the 3-point scale for rela tionship to study treatment is used (ie, “Not related,” 
“Possibly related,” and “Related”), the releva nt text below may need to be modified 
accordingly. For example, “causal relationship” would become “relationship” and “ yes” 
would become “ related.”] 
29AUG2019 CSR 1919-610-[ADDRESS_782366] dose of study treatment, a causality of yes will be assigned. The imputed values for causal relationship to stud y treatment will be used for the incidence 
summary; the values will be shown as missing in the data listings. 
14.7 MISSING DATE INFORMATION FOR ADVERSE EVENTS 
The following imputation rules only apply to cases in which the start date for AEs is 
incomplete (ie, partly missing). 
Missing month and day 
• If the year of the incomplete start date is the same as the year of  the first dose of study 
treatment, the month and day of the first dose of study treatment will be assigned to 
the missing fields 
• If the year of the incomplete start date is  before the year of the first dose of study 
treatment, December 31 will be assigned to the missing fields 
• If the year of the incomplete start date is  after the year of the first dose of study 
treatment, January 1  will be assigned to the missing fields 
Missing month only • If only the month is missing, the day will be treated as missing and both the month 
and the day will be replaced according to the above procedure 
Missing day only • If the month and year of the incomplete star t date are the same as the month and year 
of the first dose of study treatment, the day of the first dose of study treatment will be 
assigned to the missing day 
• If either the year of the incomplete start date is before the year of the date of the first 
dose of study treatment or if both years are the same but the month of the incomplete 
start date is before the month of the date of the first dose of st udy treatment, the last 
day of the month will be assigned to the missing day 
• If either the year of the incomplete start date is after the year of the date of the first 
dose of study treatment or if both years are the same but the month of the incomplete 
start date is after the month of the date of the first dose of study treatment, the first 
day of the month will be assigned to the missing day 
If the stop date is complete and the imputed st art date as above is after the stop date, the 
start date will be imputed by [CONTACT_366854].

algorithm will be used to impute the start date: 
• If the stop date is after the date of the fi rst dose of study treatment, the date of the 
first dose of study treatment will be  assigned to the missing start date 
• If the stop date is before the date of the first dose of study treatment, the stop date will be assigned to the missing start date.  
14.8 MISSING DATE INFORMATION FOR PRIOR OR CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS 
For prior or concomitant medications, includ ing rescue medications, incomplete (ie, 
partly missing) start dates and/or stop dates will be imputed. When the start date and the 
stop date are both incomplete for a patient, the start date will be imputed first. 
14.8.[ADDRESS_782367] art date. If the stop date is complete (or 
imputed) and the imputed start date is after the stop date, the start date will be imputed using the stop date.

treatment, the month and day of the first dose of study treatment will be assigned to 
the missing fields 
• If the year of the incomplete start date is  before the year of the first dose of study 
treatment, December 31 will be assigned to the missing fields 
• If the year of the incomplete start date is  after the year of the first dose of study 
treatment, January 1  will be assigned to the missing fields

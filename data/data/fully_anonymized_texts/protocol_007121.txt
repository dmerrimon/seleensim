Clinical Phase Phase I/IIa 
Study Overview 
 
 
     
 
    
 
 
 CARTISTEM® will be administered at doses ranging from 0.5×107 to 
2.25×107 hUCB-MSC (0.25×107 cells/cm2; 0.5 mL/cm2 with 0.5u107 
MSC/m L) to patients with focal, full-thickness, Grade 3-4 articular cartilage 
defects of ആ 2cm2 in size. 
 Safety:
 
Patient safety will be assessed step -wise with increasing levels of total 
hUCB -MSC and HA exposure : a total of 12 patients will be enrolled and 
treated with CARTISTEM® to evaluate whether dose limiting toxicity (DLT) 
is detected. DLT is defined as toxicity or adverse event of Grade 3 or higher 
[80 points or higher for pain] in two or more events at the surgery site among 
swelling, tenderness, range of motion, and pain in any one visit. DLT is also 
defined as adverse drug reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the Common 
Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, with the exception 
of the following events and that they are unresolved  for 7 consecutive days,

GClinical Trial 
Material (CTM)  CARTISTEM® (human allogeneic-unrelated umbilical cord blood-derived 
mesenchymal stem cel ls, hUCB-MSC, and sodium hyaluronate) 
CARTISTEM® consists of approximately 7.[ADDRESS_1038096]. 
 
Clinical Trial 
Material Dosage and 
Administration 
 CARTISTEM® will be administered into the articular cartilage defect by 
[CONTACT_758290] a dose of 0.5  mL/cm2 based upon size of the defect. The 
CARTISTEM® dosage has been selected based on the results derived from 
nonclinical studies and prior human experience (see Investigator’s Brochure 
for further information)  
Surgical  
Technique  Before application of CARTISTEM®, unstable chondral fragments are 
debrided using a curet and stable shoulders of healthy surrounding cartilage are created. After adequate removal of the debris, multiple holes are created across the entire arti
cular cartilage defect with a 2~3 mm drill bit spacing the 
holes approximately 3~5 mm apart. CARTISTEM® is applied onto the 
drilled holes first, and then throughout the entire cartilage defect. 
Post-operative 
rehabilitation Patients will be started on a cont inuous passive motion (CPM) device on 
post-operative day 1 with a range of motion of 0-30 degrees initially. This 
will be increased by 10 degrees per day as tolerated to a maximum of 0 -90 
degrees. Patients will undergo CPM treatment for 6 hours per day over 6 
weeks. The patient will remain touch-down weight- bearing (TDWB) for 6 
weeks, and then advance to full -weight bearing during the next 6 weeks (up 
to week 12) . The patient will refrain from high-impact activities, such as 
running, during the subsequent 8 to 12 weeks (week 20 – 24).  
Reference 
Therapy The study does not include a reference compound.   
Approximate 
Duration of Patient 
Participation  Each patient will undergo a 6-week screening period for eligibility and a 12-
month  follow-up observation period for both the primary (safety) and 
secondary (efficacy) evaluations following administration  of CARTISTEM®. 
Also each patient will undergo a 24 -month follow-up visit for a long term 
patient assessment.

GApproximate 
Duration of Study The estimated duration of the study for the primary evaluation is 
approximately 12 months, with an additional 12 month extension for the 
long-term patient assessment phase. 
Safety 
Evaluation  
 
 General  
General safety will be evaluated via the following assessments: AEs, routine 
clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), 
thrombin generation  (PT and aPTT), immunogenicity tests (T cell subset ), 
vital signs, physical exams , ECGs, and MRI for tumorigenicity. 
 
Adverse Events  
To assess t he safety of CARTISTEM®, the course and degree of swelling, 
tenderness, range of motion and pain will be determined.  DLT is defined as 
toxicity or adverse event of Grade 3 or higher [80 points or higher for pain] 
in two or more events at the surgery site among swelling, tenderness, range of motion, and pain, in any one visit. DLT is also defined as adverse drug 
reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the Common Toxicity Criteria  Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, with the exception of the following events and that they are unresolved
 for 7 consecutive days, despi[INVESTIGATOR_758268]:

Efficacy 
Evaluation  
 
 Primary efficacy outcome parameters w ill be the postoperative changes in 
subjective knee function as assessed by [CONTACT_758291] (International Knee Documentation Committee) score at 
12 months. For secondary efficacy 
outcome parameters, p atients will answer questionnaires for pain (visual 
analogue scale, VAS) , knee specific outcome instruments ( Lysholm knee 
scoring, and KOOS [Knee injury a nd Osteoarthritis Outcome Score] ). 
Structural information will be gathered using high-resolution (1.5 or 3 Tesla) 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

GStatistical 
Methods  General: all safety and efficacy endpoi nts will be presented for each dose 
cohort as well as for all patients combined. For safety evaluation, statistical 
homogeneity between dose groups will be performed. For efficacy 
evaluation, statistical comparison (diff erence) between dose groups will be 
performed.  
 
1) Safety  
Safety will be demonstrated with 95% confidence intervals. Advers e events, 
adverse drug reactions, serious adverse events, and drop -out patients due to 
AE will be presented with freque ncy and percentage.  Homogeneity 
between dose groups will be analyzed using person’s chi -square test or 
Fisher’s exact test. Descriptive statistics including means, medians, SD 
(standard deviation), minimum and maximum will be used to demonstrate 
the other safety endpoints.  
 
2) Efficacy  
Symptom improvement from the outcome instruments will be demonstrated 
with means and standard deviations.  Efficacy results will also be analyzed 
for statistical significance using chan ge from baseline at each efficacy 
endpoint.  Statistical difference of continuous variables and categorical 
variables between dose groups will be compared using t-test and Fisher ’s 
exact test, respectively.  
Rationale for 
Study Population and Number of 
Patients 
 CARTISTEM® is administered to the defective joint cartilage region by [CONTACT_758292]. Due to ethical considerations, it is not possible to conduct this type of procedure in
 a healthy subject. Therefore, no studies in healthy subjects 
will be performed.  
 
Factors such as number of subjects to acquire statistical data of the 
effectiveness are not considered as critical in this phase I/IIa study. A small number of subjects gener
ally participate in this stage of clinical study. 
Accordingly, Dosage A is set based on dose limit of toxicity from non -
clinical study and then Dosage B will be administered.

4 Background of the Study 
4.1 Cartilage defects 
Chondral defects or damage to articular cartila ge due to accidents, repetitive trauma or 
arthritis are common disorders. They are major causes of disability, as they can lead to 
osteoarthritis and they rarely heal spontane ously (e.g., Dragoo et al. 2003, Moore et al. 2005). 
As the population ages and as more young people pa rticipate in active sports, the size of the 
target patient group is also growing. However,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_758273], clinical 
products directed at cartilage repair remain limited. 
Articular cartilage consists of hyaline cartilage and is a highly differentiated connective 
tissue covering joint surfaces. It is avascular and alymphatic, and it is sheltered from the 
immune system. It also has no nerve supply and is therefore not sensitive to early injuries. 
Articular cartilage also has poor repair properties because there are relatively few cells in the 
tissue, the metabolic rate is low, and the capaci ty of chondrocytes to divide and migrate within 
articular cartilage is restricted by [CONTACT_758293] x. As a consequence, it is generally agreed that 
articular cartilage does not repair significantly after damage to the collagen matrix (e.g., Chang 
et al. 2006, Gelse et al. 2003, Hedrick and Daniels 2003, Katayama et al. 2004, Risbud et al. 
2001, Wakitani et al. 2002). Therefore, damage to  the tissue as a result of trauma generally 
progresses to osteoarthritis. 
In most cases, the critical limiting step for  the induction of spontaneous cartilaginous repair 
is incomplete and leads to the formation of fi brous, or at best fibrocartilage, tissue – a tissue 
intermediate of fibrous mesenchy me and cartilage, depending on th e location and size of injury. 
Compared with the native hyaline articular ca rtilage, fibrous repair tissue has poor mechanical 
qualities and is prone to fail in the long te rm (Athanasiou et al. 2001, Chuma et al. 2004, Gelse 
et al. 2003, Guo et al. 2004, Mizuta et al. 2004, Moore et al. 2005, Otsuka et al. 1997). It is,

Gtherefore, desirable to develop procedures that al low for improved repair of cartilage defects, as 
discussed below.  
4.2 Investigational cellular-surgical combined interventions 
Various different types of treatments are in us e, such as drug therapy, arthroscopy, joint 
replacement surgery, marrow stimulation tec hniques (drilling, abrasion arthroplasty and 
microfracture for stimulation of local MSC), periosteal grafts, and autologous chondrocyte 
transplantation (Athanasiou et al. 2001, Risbud et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2005). However, 
conventional treatment modalit ies have not been able to provide complete and sustained 
resolution of symptoms following damage to th e articular cartilage. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_758274], complete healing of damaged or defective cartilage or consistent 
reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage does not occur, and continuous drug administration or 
secondary surgeries are common. Thus, functional restoration of diseased and damaged human 
articular cartilage continues to remain one of the most challenging orthopedic problems and the 
clinical need for cartilage repair/regeneration technologies is undisputed (Athanasiou et al. 
2001, Elisseeff 2004, Gelse et al. 2003, Lee et al. 2010, Smith et al. 2005, Yanai et al. 2005). 
The latest attempts to develop clinically useful  procedures for repairing damaged articular 
cartilage include the use of cells with the potentia l for cartilage repair. There are three potential 
cell types that may be utilized: chondrocytes (a lready used in the autologous chondrocyte 
transplantation technique), adult (somatic) stem ce lls and embryonic stem cells (Barry 2003, 
Browne et al. 2005, Giannoni et al. 2005, Guo et al. 2004, Otsuka et al. 1997, Yanai et al. 2005).  
Chondrocyte implantation has long been consid ered as a potential treatment and several 
approaches of chondrocyte implantation are in curr ent clinical use. Implantations of previously 
isolated and in vitro  amplified autologous chondrocytes are being performed in current clinical 
practice. The disadvantages of this procedure are the limited proliferative capacity of adult 
chondrocytes, the issue of dedifferentiation in  culture and required re-differentiation upon 
implantation, as well as the need for a 2-stage procedure for harvest and implantation. 
The use of stem cells is the most recently developed and investigated method. The most 
promising approaches involve the introduction of  MSC /cartilage precursor cells. Bone marrow

Gcontains non-hematopoietic progenitor cells ca pable of differentiating into osteoblasts, 
chondrocytes and adipocytes; because those diff erentiated cells have mesodermal origin, their 
bone marrow progenitors have been designated MSC.  
The umbilical cord blood is a source of hematopoietic stem cells and is used for 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with diseases such as leukemia, aplastic 
anemia, and congenital immune deficiency that  require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplants.  Over 5,[ADDRESS_1038116] decade and MSC-based therapy 
has become one of the objects of investigat ion for a new branch of medicine termed 
regenerative medicine. This emerging technology shows great promise for producing 
transplantable cartilage constructs to restore  the function of degenerated joints. However, 
current treatment options using MSC for articular  cartilage repair/regeneration are still at an 
experimental stage of development. Studies wi th MSC were conducted in various animal 
models while currently only one clinical invest igation and two case reports with MSC are 
available (e.g., Wakitani et al. 2002, Wakitani et al. 2010).  
4.3 CARTISTEM® (MEDIPOST Cell Therapy Product)

regeneration in human subjects w ith cartilage defects of the knee as a result of ageing, trauma or

Gdegenerative diseases.  
The CARTISTEM® drug product consists of a combinat ion of human umbilical cord blood-
derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSC; suppl ied as a liquid suspension) and lyophilized 
sodium hyaluronate, provided in separate vials f or mixing prior to administration. The packaged 
drug product will be shipped and stored as tw o vials, one vial containing approximately 7.5x106 
hUCB-MSCs suspended in 1.5 mL medium (alpha-MEM) to be mixed with one vial containing 60 
mg sodium hyaluronate (lyophilized). Upon admixture  of the two vials, i.e. after distribution of 
the cells in the hyaluronate polymer, the reconstituted product (5x106 cells/mL; 40 mg/mL sodium 
hyaluronate) is formed as a viscous gel which is implanted into the cartilage lesion during open 
surgery. The initial proposed clinical dose is to be 0.5 mL/cm2 (approximately 2.5x106 cells and 
20 mg HA/cm2). Immune phenotype tests using flow cy tometer demonstrated that the hUCB-
MSCs are CD45 negative, CD14 negative, HLA- DR negative, CD29 positive, CD73 positive, 
CD105 positive, and CD166 positive. 
hUCB-MSCs, the active ingredient in CARTISTEM®, are expected to induce the regeneration 
of damaged cartilage tissues by [CONTACT_758294]-specific pathways. Sodium hyaluronate is beli eved to function as a 
medical device to provide mechanical stability to the hUCB-MSC suspension, enabling the cells 
to remain at the site of the implantation and not disseminate into adjacent areas. 
4.4 Sodium Hyaluronate 
Hyaluronic acid is a natural component of th e extracellular matrix in cartilage. The 
glycosaminoglycan is highly conserved and is widely distributed in the body. hUCB-MSCs 
express cell surface receptors (CD44) that bind to hyaluronic acid. Interaction between cells and 
the extracellular matrix regulates many biolog ical processes that are important to cartilage 
homeostasis and repair, including cell attachment,  growth, differentiation, and survival (Marcacci 
et al. 2005, Risbud et al. 2001).  
Since the 1970’s, hyaluronic acid has been clinically used as a chondroprotective agent 
(Caplan and Dennis 2006, Watterson and Esdaile 2000). In addition, sodium hyaluronate has been

GFDA approved for the treatment of osteoarthriti s of the knee since 1997 (as an orthopedic device – 
e.g. ORTHOVISC® High Mol, SUPARTZ® Dispo, SYNVISC® (Hylan G-F 20) and HYALGAN®). 
In 2003, HA was approved for injection into the mid to deep dermis for correction of moderate to 
severe facial wrinkles and folds (such as nasolab ial folds).  In all cases, the FDA has regulated 
the products as medical devices. 
The sodium hyaluronate in the CARTISTEM® product is believed to provide a stabilizing 
function to the MSC enabling them to remain at th e site of the implant and not spi[INVESTIGATOR_758275]. In fact, sodium hyaluronate (and it s derivatives) has proven to be an ideal molecule 
for use in the delivery of cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758276] (e.g., Elisseeff 2004, Marcacci et al. 2005, 
Risbud et al. 2001). In addition, hyaluronic acid  has been shown to be both non-toxic and 
biocompatible (Kasahara et al. 2008). Thus, sodium hyaluronate was considered highly desirable 
for use as a scaffold in CARTISTEM®. There is currently no evidence that the presence of sodium 
hyaluronate contributes in any way to the inherent  activity of the implanted MSC. Therefore, 
MEDIPOST considers the sodium hyaluronate to  be a device in the final administered 
CARTISTEM®. 
 
5 Purpose of the Study 
The primary objective of the proposed single-center phase I/IIa study is to evaluate the safety 
of CARTISTEM®, an allogeneic-unrelated mesenchy mal stem cell (hUCB-MSC) suspension 
mixed with sodium hyaluronate, at doses ranging from 0.5×107 to 2.25×107 hUCB-MSC in 
patients with articular cartilage defects that are equal or greater than 2cm2. 
The secondary objective of the study is to eval uate the efficacy (regeneration of defective 
cartilage and decrease of pain) of CARTISTEM®. 
CARTISTEM® will be administered, as a function of th e defect size, at a cell density of 
0.25×107 cells/cm2 (0.5 mL/cm2 with 0.5u107 hUCB-MSC/mL) directly into the articular cartilage 
defect by [CONTACT_758295].

sequentially in 2 groups in order to evaluate wh ether dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is detected.  
Each patient will undergo a 6-week screening period for eligibility and a 12-month follow-up 
observation period for both the primary (safety) and secondary (efficacy)  endpoints of the study. 
There is an additional long term follow-up obse rvation visit at 24 months. The estimated total 
duration of the study is approximately 24 months. 
Prior to administration of CARTISTEM®, the defect will undergo debridement, and following 
appropriate preparation, perforat ion of the subchondral plate. 
CARTISTEM® is applied directly onto the entire defect site.  
For use at the clinical site, CARTISTEM® will be provided as a cell suspension a nd lyoph ilized

6.3 Number of Subjects  
1) Estimated Number of Patients 
This study requires 12-18 patients (6-9 patien ts per arm depending on rate of DLT) for two 
different dose ranges (Dosage A: defect sizes of 2-5 cm2 and Dosage B: defect sizes of 
above 5 cm2).  
2) Target Number of Subjects and Rationale 
This is a phase I/IIa clinical trial to evalua te safety and exploratory efficacy of the 
investigational drug product. Therefore, it is not considered critical to  base the number of 
subjects on formal statistical power calculations. Six patients at each dose cohort enrolled 
sequentially are considered sufficient for this st udy. This study will be performed with two 
dose ranges, on the basis of existing pre-clinical te st results. Initially, [ADDRESS_1038127] sizes (above 5 cm2) will be recruited for Dosage B of the study. 
There could be a need for an intermediate dos e or up to 6 additional patients, based on the 
rate of DLT seen.

G6.4 Administration Dosage 
1) Initial Administration Dosage and Rationale  
It is somewhat well understood by [CONTACT_758296][INVESTIGATOR_758278]® administered locally into an anatomical defect there is no 
simple extrapolation of a safe starting dose in humans based primarily upon body surface 
area calculations derived from animal studies. 
In addition, dose determinations in this cl inical setting should take into account the 
surface area of the cartilage defect such that all NOAEL values should be converted into a 
unit quantity (cells/cm2) at the application site. This approa ch applies to most therapeutics 
administered into anatomical co mpartments that have little s ubsequent distribution outside 
of the compartment; it is recommended that doses are normalized between species according 
to the compartmental volumes and amount of the therapeutic product. 
Support for the range of CARTISTEM® doses (0.5 × 107 cells to 2.25 × 107 cells) to be 
evaluated for safety and efficacy in this phase I/IIa study comes from both preclinical 
studies and clinical results in humans (comprise d of a completed Phase I/II study in Korean 
patients with articular cartilage defects (N=7) and an ongoing Phase III study in Korean 
patients (N=50), as follows:  
NOAELs for CARTISTEM® have been determined in the rat (Study No. B04001; 
NOAEL = 3x107 cells per mL; > 1x107 cells per cm2) and the rabbit (Study No. B04004; 
NOAEL = 1.5x107 cells per mL; > 0.3x107 cells per cm2); however, it is possible that the 
design of these studies did not allow for  a proper assessment of the NOAEL due to 
limitations on the density of cells administered , and an overall very low toxicity of the 
hUCB-MSC in the species examined.  
No treatment-related SAEs have been reported  in seven patients who participated in a 
phase I/II Korean study and 50 patients curren tly enrolled in an ongoing phase III Korean 
study; all of these patients have received single administrations of 0.25×107 cells/cm2 (0.5 
ml/cm2 with 0.5x107 MSC/mL) up to a maximum of 2.25x107 total MSC; this number of 
cells represents a much higher dose than the NOAEL (10x107 MSC per mL) derived from 
CARTISTEM®                                                                                                    page  23 of 137 G

GStudy B04001 (GLP repeat-dose toxicology study in rats). 
Based on these findings (for further discussion, please see the Investigator’s Brochure), 
MEDIPOST has selected a single administration of CARTISTEM® at 0.25×107 cells/cm2 
(0.5 mL/cm2 with 0.5x107 hUCB-MSC/mL), with both the volume and total number of 
hUCB-MSC administered to patients b eing a function of the defect size.  
Similar products available on the market include CARTICEL® manufactured by 
[CONTACT_758297], an autologous cultured chondrocyte product approved by [CONTACT_36432]-FDA. 
Clinical studies of CARTICEL® were conducted at dose levels ranging from 0.64×106 
cells/cm2 up to 3.3×106 cells/cm2 for the 1.2×107 cells/0.4mL product. Meanwhile, 
Chondron, the autologous chondrocyte regenera tion therapy of Cellontech, Korea, is a 
1.2×107 cells/0.4mL product which is applied at a ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_1038130]. For cartilage defects greater than 4 cm2 in size, the entire vial is 
administered. 
Both CARTICEL® and Chondron are autologous chondrocyte therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], with limits in 
cell proliferation and maximum number of cells th at can be achieved in the defect. In other 
words, the limited cell number is a challenge an d it is difficult to de termine a constant cell 
concentration per unit area in larger defect size s. Also, there are potentially large differences 
in cell potency since the starting materials/livi ng cells are derived in a patient-specific 
manner and, therefore, typi[INVESTIGATOR_758279]. 
 CARTISTEM® can be differentiated from these tw o products because it is an off-the-
shelf allogeneic-unrelated cellular therapy that  allows a consistent application of the most 
effective cell concentration per area of defect throughout the entire lesion with a constant 
cell concentration. 
Against this background, the most scientific and logical approach for the study would 
be to perform the clinical trial using tw o different cell concentrations of 0.5×107 cells/mL 
and 1.0×107 cells/mL. However, it was deemed ethica lly inappropriate to subject a treatment

CARTISTEM®, consisting of mesenchymal stem cells and sodium hyaluronate, will be 
applied at a dose of 0.5 mL/cm2. The administered dose is, therefore, a function of the defect 
size. It will be administered into the cartilage defect by [CONTACT_758295].

6.5 Dose Escalation 
This clinical trial will employ the following dose escalation scheme: 
A total of 12-18 patients will be enrolled and treated with CARTISTEM® for dose 
limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation. Init ially, 6 patients with lesion sizes of 2 – 5 cm2 will be 
assigned to Dosage A and treated with 0.5 – 1.25x107 MSCs; if dose limiting toxicity is not 
observed at the 3 month time point for the firs t clinical efficacy evaluation, then another 6 
patients with lesion sizes of above 5 cm2 will be assigned to Dosage B and treated with 
more than 1.25 x 107 MSCs for further safety evaluation. If a DLT occurs to one or two 
patients of the group treated with the dosage A, 3 more patients will be assigned to dosage A. 
If DLT happens to 3 of the patients who were treated with the dosage A or above, this study 
will be halted and the FDA and IRB will be  notified. The Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee will perform a comprehensive review of safety (see Section 9.1).

sizes will be enrolled and assigned to dosag e B. In case of no DLT observed, a total of 12 
patients will be enrolled for safety and effica cy evaluation. However, 18 patients could be 
enrolled if DLT occurs to two patients. If DLT occur 3 or more patients treated with Dosage 
B, this study will be halted and the FDA a nd IRB will be notified. The Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee will perform a comprehe nsive review of safety (see Section 9.1).

9 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any undesired clinical responses or complication 
experienced by a subject. All operative and postoperative adverse events, whether related 
or not, will be documented on the AE case report form (CRF). 
9.1 Criteria for Safety Assessment 
 Vital sign monitoring, physical examination (swelling, tenderness, range of motion, and 
pain), and laboratory evaluations will be car ried out to determine the safety of the 
investigational product. When an adverse event occurs, the type, the severity, dates of the 
onset and resolution of the adverse event, and the relationship between the investigational 
product and the adverse event will be investigated and documented on the case report form. 
Causality of the adverse events will be de termined according to the following criteria: 
9 Not related: the adverse experience is defi nitely not related to the investigational 
product 
9 Unlikely: there are other, more likely ca uses and the investigational product is not 
suspected as a cause 
9 Suspected, reasonable possibility: the direct  cause and effect relationship between 
the drug and the adverse event has not been  demonstrated but there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event was caused by [CONTACT_33641]. 
9 Probable: there probably is a direct ca use and effect relationship between the 
adverse event and the investigational product

2.2 The hypothesis is that the two techniques will be equally effective in 
providing analgesia following hip and femur surgery in the pediatric 
population; however,  the time to perform the FICB will be shorter 
than the lumbar plexus block.

extremities despi[INVESTIGATOR_651464].  Additionally, epi[INVESTIGATOR_651465] a unilateral 
procedure. Lumbar plexus blockade (LPB) has recently seen 
increased use as an adjunct to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_651466].3,4  However, the technique is 
complex, tim e-consuming, and is associated with potential 
complications including needle advancement into the peritoneum or 
retroperitoneum, which may result in a renal hematoma, vascular 
puncture (retroperitoneal hematoma), or even bowel puncture.  
Alternatively, fas cia iliaca compartment block (FICB) provides an 
easy and safe technique to anesthetize the femoral, lateral femoral 
cutaneous, and obturator nerves in a superficial fascial plane avoiding 
the potential risks of lumbar plexus block.5  FICB reduces opi[INVESTIGATOR_651467].  Desmet et 
al. demonstrated that a supra -inguinal FICB reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_651468] 46% in the first 24 hours and 45% over [ADDRESS_873780]-op. 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
5.1 Study subjects  will receive either a LPB or a suprainguinal FICB 
under ultrasound guidance. Either block will be achieved with 3 
mg/kg (0.6 mL/kg) of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% with 1:200,[ADDRESS_873781] of care and patients 
could rec eive either one without participating in this study.  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  LPB vs FICB  
 Page 5 of 12 HRP -503  v.12.10.18  6.0 Procedures Involved * 
6.1 This will be a double -blinded, randomized, prospective study 
involving patients, ranging in age between 2 and 18 years of age, 
ASA grade I -III, undergoing elective orthopedic surgica l procedures 
involving the hip and upper thigh. Patients will be randomly divided 
into 2 groups: Group LP and Group FICB.  The block (LP or FICB) 
will be performed by [CONTACT_50501]. The team 
providing intraoperative care will step out of t he room during the 
regional block and care will be provided by [CONTACT_651476]. Once the primary anesthesia 
team finishes the induction phase, the study team will perform the 
regional anesthesia  time -out.  Measure ment of the time to complete 
the block will start when the time -out is completed and end when the 
need is withdrawn and the patient is positioned in the surgical 
positioning.  The perioperative care teams will be blinded to the type 
of the block by [CONTACT_2329] t wo dressings in all the patients.  The first 
dressing will be placed at the actual site of needle insertion and the 
second dressing at the site where needle would have been inserted if 
the patient were to receive the other type of block (in the back for th e 
LP block and groin for the FICB).  
6.2 Anesthetic care will be standardized in all patients except for type of 
the regional nerve block. Patients requiring anxiolysis will receive 
oral midazolam 0.3 -0.5 mg/kg (maximum 20 mg) 30 minutes prior 
surgery or intrav enous midazolam (0.05 mg/kg up to 2 mg) prior to 
transport to the operating room. Once in the operating room, all 
patients will be monitored as per standard ASA guidelines. 
Anesthetic induction will be achieved with 70% nitrous oxide in 
oxygen and sevoflur ane or with intravenous propofol. If preoperative 
midazolam was not administered, intravenous midazolam will be 
administered (0.05 mg/kg to a maximum of 2 mg). Following loss of 
consciousness, fentanyl (2 µg/kg) will be administered and the 
trachea intubat ed. Administration of neuromuscular blocking agents 
(NMBA) will be deferred until  after regional anesthesia technique 
has been performed.  Rocuronium (0.6 -1 mg/kg)  will be used 
according to surgeons request . In case NMBA are needed for 
tracheal intubation then succinylcholine (1 -2mg/kg) will be used.    
Anesthesia will be maintained with 1 -2 MAC of sevoflurane in 50% 
oxygen/air.   Following endotracheal intubation, patients will receive 
either a LPB or a supr ainguinal FICB under ultrasound guidance. 
Either block will be achieved with 3 mg/kg (0.6 mL/kg) of 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% with 1:200,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  Maximum block 
volume will be 30 mL for both blocks.  The time from the initiation 
of the time -out for the bloc k until the patient has been returned to the 
surgical position will be noted.  Additional intraoperative analgesia 
will be achieved with bolus doses of fentanyl 1 µg/kg to maintain the 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  LPB vs FICB  
 Page 6 of 12 HRP -503  v.12.10.18  heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of baseline. Prophylaxis for 
postoperative nausea and vomiting will include dexamethasone (0.1 -
0.15 mg/kg up to 8 mg) and ondansetron (0.1 -0.15 mg/kg up to 4 
mg). At the conclusion of surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade 
will be reversed and the patient’s trachea extubated.  
6.3 Postope rative analgesia will be achieved with IV hydromorphone as 
needed (PRN)  with a dose regimen of 0.02 mg/kg per dose.  
Depending on patient ’s use if there is need to escalate treatment a 
PCA, NCA or CCA will be started.  Patients will also receive IV 
acetamino phen 15 mg/kg every 6 hours and IV ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg 
every 6 hours (unless contraindicated) during the [ADDRESS_873782] dose of these two agents will be administered in the 
operating room at the completion of the surgical procedure.  If t he 
patient is ready to transition from IV to oral pain medications, 
oxycodone (0.1 mg/kg every 4 hours) will be started and the 
hydromorphone discontinued.  At that time, acetaminophen will be 
switched to oral and ketorolac switched to oral ibuprofen.  
6.4 The following data will be collected:  
• Block procedure time (in minutes and seconds)  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_380048].  
• Postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_651469].  
• Postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_651470] 48 hours 
after surgery (PACU discharge to i npatient ward 
admission).  
• Pain assessment scores (VAS in older children, FACES 
scales in children between 2 -4 and FLACC for non -
verbal children) in the PACU (first pain score) and for the 
first 48 hours ( standard pain assessments ) on the inpatient 
ward.  
• The duration of the need for intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  
• Use of rescue pain medications in the PACU, on the 
floor, including non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], will also be recorded and 
analyzed.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
The following demographic and surgical parameters will also be 
collected and recorded: patient age, gender, race/ethnicity, 
height, weight, ASA status, primary diagnosis, list of 
comorbidities, procedure, date, duration, admission status 
intraoperative med ications, PACU arrival and discharge times, 
discharge destination, pain scores (including recorded time),

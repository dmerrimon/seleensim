TITLE OF STUDY:  Long -term Follow -up of ND4  LHON S ubjects  Treated  With GS010 O cular  Gene 
Therapy  in the  RESCUE  or REVERSE  Phase III  Clinical Trials  
INVESTIGATIONAL  CENTERS : The 7 investigational c enters  are located  in the European Union  (United 
Kingdom  [1], [LOCATION_009]  [1], [LOCATION_013]  [1], and Italy [1]) and the [LOCATION_002]  (3) and will be the same centers 
as those used in the RESCUE and REVERSE  studies . 
STUDY PERIOD: The total study period for an individual subject will be  [ADDRESS_802186] visit.  
PLANNED STUDY  DATES:  The planned duration of the long -term follow -up is 5 years starting from  
approximately the end of  2017 and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_605748]  2022.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective : To assess the long -term safety of intravitreal GS010 administration up to [ADDRESS_802187] -
treatment in subjects who were treated in the RESCUE or REVERSE studi es. 
Secondary Objective s: (1) To assess the long -term efficacy of intravitreal GS010 administration up to 
[ADDRESS_802188] -treatment in subjects who were treated in the RESCUE or R EVERSE studies.  
(2) To assess the quality of life  (QOL)  in subjects who were treated with GS010 in the RESCUE or 
REVERSE studies for up to [ADDRESS_802189] -treatment . 
STUDY DESIG N: Background : Subjects  with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy  (LHON)  who 
participated  in the  RESCUE and REVERSE clinical trials were administered  gene therapy  with the 
investigational medicinal product ( IMP), GS010 , by a single  intravitreal  (IVT) inject ion in a single  randomly -
selected  eye, while the  fellow eye  received a sham  IVT injection . The European Medicines Agency  
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use guideline recommends a m onitoring plan  for the purpose 
of observing subjects for potential delayed adverse events  (AEs) for up to [ADDRESS_802190] -treatment; hence, the 
main rationale for initiating this long -term follo w-up study.  Study  Design : This will be a  Phase III 
prospective non -interventional long -term follow -up clinical study of subjects previously treated with GS010  
and sham  during  2 Phase III studies —RESCUE and REVERSE . The long -term follow -up study will follow 
subjects over an additional  [ADDRESS_802191] -injection follow -up. The  long-term follow -up 
study will  include 5 visits  at 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5  years  after IMP injection.  Assessments : Safety, efficacy, and 
QOL  variables will be assessed during each of the 5 long-term follow -up visits and descriptive  summaries 
and statistic al testing  will be used for analysis of the data.  
ENDPOINTS:  
Primary Endpoint  
1) Adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) (ocular or system ic) related to IMP or 
administration procedure, as judged by [CONTACT_737], reported during  the long -term follow -up

2) Change in contrast sensitivity measured with the Pelli -Robson chart in all -, best -, and worst -eyes 
treated with GS010 IVT injection compared to all -, best -, and worst -eyes treated with sham IVT 
injection respectively, from the RESCUE or REVERSE study baselines an d pooled , to the follow -up 
study time points (2, 3, 4 , and 5 years).  
3) Change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) reported with Logarithm of the Minim al Angle of 
Resolution (LogMAR), change of parameters measured with Humphrey™ v isual field (HVF) 30 -2, 
and change of parameters measured with spectral -domain optical coherence tomograp hy (SD -OCT) 
in all -, best - and worst -eyes treated with GS010 IVT injection compared to all -, best -, and worst -
eyes treated with sham IVT injection respectively, from the RESCUE or  REVERSE study baselines 
and pooled, to each follow -up study time points (2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years).

injection, including all -, best - and worst -eyes receiving GS010 or sham respectively,  with responder 
eyes defined by:  
a. An improvement of at least 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS) letters 
(equivalent to a decrease of at least 0.3 LogMAR) compared to baseline, or having  a Snellen 
acuity equivalent better than 20/200. The McNemar test will be used for com parisons from the 
RESCUE or REVERSE study baselines and pooled , to each of the follow -up study time points 
(2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 years).  
b. Eyes that lose less than the 15 ETDRS letters (equivalent to an increase of  less than 
0.3 LogMAR) compared to the RESCUE  or REVERSE study baselines and pooled.

5.1 Disease Review  
Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare, maternally inherited mi tochondrial 
genetic disease, typi[INVESTIGATOR_605750] a non -syndromic optic neuropathy. Retinal ganglion 
cells (RGC), whose axons form the optic nerve, are the major cellular targ et affected by [CONTACT_605759]. LHON was the first inherited human dise ase associated 
with point mutations in the mitochondrial D NA (mtDNA)1and it is considered the most 
common inherited genetic mitochondrial disorder .2 LHON is a rare disease , and in Northern 
Europe, an estimated prevalence ranging from  1 in 30,000 to 1 in 50,000 has been reported.3-5 
Three primary point mutations in the mtDNA are cau sative of LHON in approximately 90% 
of those affected. These point mutations, G3460A, G11778A and T14484C, occur respectively 
in the ND1, ND4 , and ND6  genes of the mtDNA , and all encode protein subunits of Complex 
I (CI) of the mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_35226]. The resultant dysfunction of CI a nd the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_605751], decreased  adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) production , and increased reactive oxygen species. This leads to cell death 
of the RGC and the resultin g atrophy of the optic nerve.3 
LHON manifests as acute to sub -acute, sequential, bilateral, painless vision loss. It is a bilateral 
disease , and the clinical manifestation is essentially predictive of bilateral involvement. Greater 
than 97% of patients are reported to have bilateral involvement at 12  months and occurrences 
of unilateral involvement in retrospective reports of cohorts with LHON ar e very rare .6,7 A 
G11778A ND4  cohort was studied in which 53% reported bilateral involvement in ≤  2 months , 
and 80% reported bilateral involvement in ≤[ADDRESS_802212] vision and central and cecocentral visual field defects  and a final visual 
acuity of 20/200 or worse in 98% of eyes .6,10 A prospective natural history study8 reported 
LHON subjects with the G11778A ND4  mutation. The primary outcome was the finding of no 
significant diffe rence in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual 
acuity at 12, 24 , or 36 months of follow -up compared to baseline at study entry. This finding 
was for the entire cohort as well as for the subgroups of patients who entered t he study within 
12 months of disease onset or after 12  months of disease onset. Improvement by ≥15 ETDRS 
letters occurred in 14.7% of total study eyes in 18% of study patients  over the study period . 
Eighty -six percent of patients had eyes with stable acuities during study follow -up. Subjects 
entering the study after [ADDRESS_802213] ( IMP) will be administered. GS010 was administered to subjects via standard  
intravitreal ( IVT) injection  in RESCUE or REVERSE . Please see the Phase III study protocols

Generation of GS010 Safety Profile 
For the profile of GS010 including  the expected adverse events, please refer to the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure. Investigators are  also referred to Van Der Reis11 and 
Jager12 for review of IVT injection -associated adverse effects.  
5.2.1  Benefit Assessment  
The main potential benefit for subjects with LHON due to the G11778A ND4  mutation who 
receive GS010 IVT is halting, reversal  (neuroprotection) or improvement of vision loss due to 
disease progression (neuroenhancement) . Statistical modeling of the vision test results from 
GS-LHON -CLIN -[ADDRESS_802214] udies. The risks associated 
with gene therapy  IMPs  are as follows:  
Risk of Immune R esponse:  Although the eye is considered to be an  immune -privileged site ,[ADDRESS_802215] the newly introduced foreign protein or a T -cell response to the capsid could lower the 
therapeutic efficacy or cause local inflammation. Immune reactions agains t adenovirus-
associated viral vector serotype 2 (AAV2/2 ) will be monitored throughout the study.  The 
AAV2/[ADDRESS_802216] been reported .14 
Insertional Mutagenesis:  Adeno- associated virus es (AAV ) are non -integrative viruses. Studies 
performed in vivo with mouse liver suggest that AAV vectors integrate in to the host genome ; 
however no direct evidence of tumorigenesis due to AAV2/2 integration or other AAV 
serotypes has been observed in all preclini cal studies and clinical trial data accumulated so far. 
This risk is considered as minimal.  
Germ -line T ransmission : Based on preclinical and clinical data, the risk of germ -line 
transmission is low. The probability that a recombination event could occur is very l ow. 
Dissemination : The risk of vector shedding after in vivo gene therapy depends on the route of 
administration and the vector dose administered.  An exhaustive report gather ed the bio -
distribution and shedding data from pre- clinical and clinical studies obtained for the HADV- 5 
and AAV2/2 vector .15 These studies conclude that the more compartments the viral vector has

RESCUE and REVERSE Long -term Follow -up  Version 2.0;  17 September  2018  
 
  Page 18 of 65 to pass to reach a certain excretion route, the lower the risk of shedding is, due to e ither dilution 
of the viral vector, or degradation in case of passage through the stomach or interaction w ith 
the immune system.  The possible consequence of leakage of the vector into  the environment 
is expected to be low as shedding is minimal and transient. Nevertheless, recombi nation with 
endogenous pathogenic replication -competent adenovirus might occur, therefore leading to 
AAV2/2 replication. 
5.2.3  Summary of Benefit s: Risk s 
The overa ll risk -benefit balance of IVT injection of GS010 for the treatment of vision loss  due 
to the ND4  mutation  causing  LHON  is not yet available  as no formal  clinical  efficacy  analysis 
has been provided  at the time of planning of th is long- term follow -up study. T he IMP , GS010, 
is considered to be safe and well tolerated . 
5.3 Study Rationale 
The dramatic loss of vision in  individuals with  LHON is life -changing, disabl ing, and affects 
their families socially, emotionally, and financially. LHON greatly alters a patient’s ability to 
perform daily activities, reduces a patient's autonomy, and particularly  disrupts the ability to 
read. The quality of life (Q OL) in patients with LHON remains poor, even relative to other 
forms of chr onic vision loss of other etiologies.16 LHON rep resents an urgent medical need . 
Currently there is no approved therapeutic agent for the treatment of vision los s from LHON 
in the [LOCATION_002]. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided conditional app roval 
under exceptional circumstances for Raxone® (International Non -Proprietary Name [NN]: 
Idebenone) (Raxone® European Product Assessment Report 2015). A study of i debenone for 
the treatment of vision loss from LHON , caused by [CONTACT_605760] 
(ND1, ND4, ND6 ), failed to reach its primary endpoint .17 Vision loss from LHON remains an 
unmet medical need.  
The IMP , GS010, is a replication -defective single -stranded DNA recombinant adeno-
associated virus 2 (rAAV2) vector containing a codon -modified complimentary DNA (cDNA), 
encoding the human wild type mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 4 protein (rAAV2/2 -
ND4 ), under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in an intron -
containing expression cassette (beta globin intron, HBB2), flanked by [CONTACT_605761]2/2. GS010 is under development for the treatment of vision loss 
in LHON when due to the G11778A ND4  mitochondrial mutation.  
GS010 has received orphan drug status in both the [LOCATION_002] of America ( [LOCATION_003] ) and the 
European Union ( EU) (respectively #13 4120 and #EMA/OD/164/10). GenSight Biologics has 
completed the preclinical development stage and has conducted a Phase I /II safety and 
tolerability trial. Subsequently, 2 P hase III  clinical studies , the RESCUE and  REVERSE 
studies ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], respectively ) of GS 010, were initiated in the [LOCATION_003] 
and EU.  Subjects in the RESCUE and REVERSE were treated with the gene therapy IMP 
GS010 injected once in a single, randomly selected  eye. The fellow eye received a sham  IVT 
injection per the randomized treatment allocation.  This long- term follow -up study will be 
considered part of the Phase III program and is an extension of the  post- treatment  2-year

Long- term Risk Assessment and Management 
According to the EMA  Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use Guideline, entitled 
“Follow- Up of Patients Administered with Gene Therapy Medicinal Products ,” and the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)  Center for Biologics E valuation and Research  
Guidance for Industry (2006) entitled , “Gene Therapy Clinical Trials: Observing Subjects for 
Delayed Adverse Events,” viral vectors without integration, latency, or react ivation potential 
like AAV vectors present a low risk for gene therapy -related delayed adverse reactions. 
Although the FDA  indicated that  long- term follow -up is not considered necessary for this  
clinical development  program, the EMA recommends a yearly monitoring plan up to [ADDRESS_802217]- treatment.  
The regulatory intention of further  observation is to determine the sustainability of efficacy, or 
whether declining efficacy after administration of gene therapy IMP  occurs or whether more 
time is needed for tissue to be fully functional. For safety, the intention is to det ermine delayed -
onset of adverse events ( AEs), and to determine any additional unexplored long -term risks. 
The EMA refers to the Guideline (2008) entitled “Safety and Efficacy Follow -up: Risk 
Management of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products” for possible delayed risks. One  area 
for long -term observation is the potential risk directly related to the administration procedure 
of advanced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and for this program would be the technique of IVT injection and any 
associated long -term effects.  
In summary, a ll treated subjects in the  RESCUE and REVERSE studies will be offered 
participation in the GS-LHON -CLIN06 study for the purpose of long- term safet y evaluations , 
but only those providing informed consent and meet ing eligibility criteria will be included in 
the study.

7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study will be a  multinational  multicenter prospective non -interventional long -term 
follow- up clinical study of subjects previously treated with GS010 in either the RESCUE  or 
REVERSE  studies. Of the  7 investigational centers  participating , 4 are located  in Europe 
(1 each in [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Italy, and the [LOCATION_008], ) and 3 are located in  the United 
States.  
Subjects will be enrolled in the long- term fol low-up study when informed consent is provided  
and inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Enrollment will occur during the Inc lusion Period,  
which will be  during  the RESCUE  and REVERSE study Week 96 /End-of-Study ( EOS ) Visit 
or anytime  up to 1 day prior to the long -term follow -up study  Visit 2 ( Day 180 ). Preferably , 
the assessments required  to be performed  during the Inclusion Period will be conducted at the 
RESCUE  and REVERSE study Week 96/EOS visit; however, if the subject cannot undergo all 
assessments at that time, the assessments may be performed at a later date  during the Inclusion 
Period , but no later than  one day before the Year 2.5 visit (Day 180). 
The study population will be limited to the number of subjects treated  in the RESCUE and 
REVERSE studies. The total length of the long- term follow -up study will be [ADDRESS_802220]’s first visit  in this study . The approximate study end 
date is  planned to be towards the end of year [ADDRESS_802221]’s last visit.  
The follow -up will  include onsite assessments of safety, QOL, and efficacy  as in the RESCUE 
and REVERSE studies . The study will include 5  follow-up study visits: at 2.[ADDRESS_802222]- treatment . 
Statistical analysis of the data will include  descriptive summaries  of safety , QO L assessments , 
and statistical testing of efficacy endpoints.

10.1 Adverse Events  
10.1.1   Summary and Overview 
An AE can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
symp tom or disease temporally associated with the IMP/study procedure,  whether or not 
considered causally related  with the IMP/study procedure. 
Adverse events  should be volunteered by [CONTACT_423], be observed from examination of the 
subject at a n investigative center  visit, or from observations of clinically significant laboratory 
values or special examination abnormal values. AEs will not be solicited in this long- term 
follow-up study by [CONTACT_2224] a specific list of anticipated events.  
Surgical p rocedures planned before enrolment of the subject in the study are not considered 
AEs if the condition was known before study inclusion. In this case, the medical condition 
should be reported in the subject’s medical history. 
Worsening of visual acuity determined by [CONTACT_605769] N will not be considered an AE. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_802251] and/or I nvestigator may contact [CONTACT_19578]’ s primary physician to collect the data 
needed for complete AE assessment . Further monitoring of AEs will occur for those AEs 
recorded on the eCRF. 
AEs to be recorded on the eCRF and further monitored by [CONTACT_605770]: 
• Any AE that is causally related to  GS010 IVT and/or study procedure 
• Any ocular or vision -related AE  that is  causally related or unrelated to study medication 
and/or study procedure 
• Any SAE  that is  causally related or unrelated to study medication and/or study 
procedure. 
 
Clinically significant abnormal findings observed during physical examinati on, vital signs  
measurement , or ECG recording will be re corded in the eCRF  as an AE  if the clinically 
significant  abnormal finding is deemed as causally related to the study medication or study 
procedure.

of the eCRF (also called the “AE page”).  The following  AE data  must be assessed and 
documented: 
• Date of onset and date of res olution (i.e. actual dates when the event starts and is 
resolved rather than dates when the Investigator is informed). 
• Nature/description of the event with self -explanatory and concise medical terminology 
(indicate a diagnosis or syndrome instead of sympto ms). A diagnosis (a  single 
diagnostic term ), if available,  should be used for documentation in the eCRF , rather 
than a subset of individual symptoms comprising the diagnosis ; each diagnostic 
verbatim term will be counted as a single AE . 
• Severity.  
• Relationship to GS010 IVT injection.  
• Relationship to study procedure. 
• Seriousness. 
• Any action taken regarding the event, whether by [CONTACT_737], the subject  (as 
reported by [CONTACT_423]), or by [CONTACT_20427] (as reported by [CONTACT_605772]’s medical record).  
• Outcome.  
AEs requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical  care to protect the 
health and well -being of the subject. Any treatment given will be reported on the page 
"Concomitant medication" of the CRF.  
If known, the name [CONTACT_605800], in preference to the listing 
of individual signs or symptoms. 
Severity  Intensity/ Grading  
The severity of clinical AE is graded according to the Common Terminology Crit eria for 
Adverse E vents (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE scale will be provided to Investigators. 
 
Should an event be missing in one of the scales, the follow ing [ADDRESS_802252] be used: 
• Mild: discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity. 
• Moderate: discom fort sufficient to affect normal daily activity.  
• Severe: inability to work or perform normal daily activity.

Relationship  to IMP and/or Study Procedure(s)  
The Investigator is requested to assess the relationship of any clinical adv erse experiences to 
study treatment  and/or study procedure s. The relationship of each AE to the study treatment  
and/or study procedur es will be evaluated using  the following definitions: 
 
• Unrelated: T here is evidence of relationship to a cause other than the  GS010 IVT 
injection or study procedure. Does not meet criteria listed under unlikely, possibl e, or 
probable.  
• Unlikely: D oes not fol low a reasonable temporal sequence from administration  of 
GS010 IVT injection or study procedure  and is most likely produced by [CONTACT_423]'s 
clinical state and/or by [CONTACT_605773]/or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Possible: F ollows a reason able temporal sequence from administration  of GS010 IVT 
injection or study procedure and is not likely produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinica l state 
and/or by [CONTACT_605773]/or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293]. 
• Probable: F ollows a reasonable temporal seq uence from administration  GS010 IVT 
injection or study procedure . Clear -cut temporal association.  
• Related: I ncludes all of the following: 
o It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug. 
o It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_605774]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other modes of therapy administe red 
to the subject.  
o It follows a known pattern of response to the suspected drug. 
 
Outcome  
The outcome of each AE will be rated as follows: 
• Recovered  
• Not recovered  
• Recovered  with sequelae 
• Fatal ; This outcome is to be used only for an event leading to death. The outcome of 
all other events at the time of the death must be reported. The outcome of ongoing ones 
is reported as "not recovered".

• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect;  
• Important medical events not captured by [CONTACT_207412], for example,  
require medical intervention to prevent one of the above criteria . 
 
Definition of Serious Criteria  
Life-threatening: an AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred (i .e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it 
had occurred in a more serious form). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605752] a pre -existing condition that has not worsened, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605753] s or 
SAEs. Any untoward event occurring during the procedure must be reported as an AE, either 
'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria.  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605754] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139090]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate i n the 
physi cian's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]'  occurred 
or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Disability/incapacitating: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience  results in a 
substantial an d/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
Events Not to Be Considered an SAE  
Events associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605755]: 
• Evaluation or treatment of a pre -existing c ondition and  a non- exacerbating  condition as 
long as the condition(s) associated with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: 
o Existed prior to the subject ’s entry into the study and has been recorded in the subject ’s 
medica l history as documented in the CRF (e .g., degenerative disease)  
o Has not worsened in severity or frequency following the subject ’s exposure to study 
medication  
o Has not required a change in treatment management following the subject ’s exposure 
to the study medication .

Serious Adverse Event  Documentation and Reporting  
Reporting requirements for SAEs will be managed on behalf of  GenSight by a third -party 
vendor. 
Any SAE occurring during the course of the study, i .e., between the ICF signature [CONTACT_605801], MUST be reported  to the Sponsor or the ir representative  as soon as it becomes 
known . The Investigator must complete and email  or fax a "Serious Adverse Event Form" to 
the Sponsor or their designee within 24 hours of occurrence or knowledge of the event. 
An Investigator’s delegate may complete the SAE form; however, the Princ ipal Investigator 
or delegate physician must sign it. The form can be sent to the Sponsor or their de signee with 
the delegate's signature [CONTACT_605802]/delegate physician’ s signature [CONTACT_605803]. The Principal Investigator/delegate physici an’s signature

11.5 Statistical Methods  
11.5.1  Safety Analys es 
Primary  Safety Analysis 
Adverse events and SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure wil l be summarized 
in two different ways: (1) systemic AEs and SAEs related to study drug/procedure, and (2) ocular 
AEs and SAEs related to study drug/procedure. Systemic AE data will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_587016]. Ocular AE data will be summarized by [CONTACT_605776]010 eye only.  
Clinically significant abnorm al findings observed during physical examination, vital signs 
measurement, ECG recording, or laboratory values will be summarized as AEs i n the AE tables 
if the clinically significant abnormal finding is deemed as causally related to the  study medication 
or study procedure. 
The following summaries will be produced for (1) SAEs unrelated to study drug /study procedure , 
(2) systemic AEs/SAEs related to study drug/procedure , and (3)  ocular AEs/SAEs related to study 
drug/study procedure, using counts and percentage as follows: 
• Overall summary of AEs/SAEs related to study drug/procedure 
• AEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure, including the number of events 
reported  
• AEs/SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure by [CONTACT_764]  
• AEs/SA Es related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure leading to study 
discontinuation 
• SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure 
• SAEs related to GS010 IVT injection or study procedure leading to death . 
Events will be coded using the  MedDRA  and summarized by  [CONTACT_72065]. 
Secondary  Safety Analysis 
The number, type, frequency, and severity of ocular or vision -related AEs, including those with 
no relation or any relation to the GS010 IVT injection or study procedure will be pre sented in the 
same way that the primary endpoint of ocular AEs/SAEs related  to GS010 IVT injection or study 
procedure. 
11.5.2  Secondary Long- term Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Pelli -Robson Contrast Sensitivity

[IP_ADDRESS]  LogMAR 
Analysis for European Medicines Agency  
The primary analysis will be performed on the  intent- to-treat (ITT) population . The change fr om 
baseline to e ach follow -up visit in the LogMAR acuity will be the response. The change from 
baseline of all -GS010 eyes will be compared to the change from baseline of all -sham eyes (intra -
subject comparison) using a mixed -effects ANCOVA model  using the following terms (or 
covariate) in the model: 
• Subject  and eyes of the subject as random factors  
• The baseline LogMAR  
• Treatment  
The investigative site  will not be included in th is analysis as the number of subjects recruited per 
site will be very small. However, stratification by [CONTACT_605777] p erformed as a 
sensitivity analysis. Neighboring countries can be pooled to reach at least 9  subjects  per 
geographical entity. The analysis will be performed based on alpha of 0.05 (two- sided test).  
An additional model will add the treatment by [CONTACT_605778].  
Analysis for Food and Drug Administration 
The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT population. The change from baseline of  the 
best-GS010 treated eyes will be compared to the change from baseline of the best -sham eyes 
(inter -subject comparison) using an ANCOVA with baseline LogMAR as covariate.  The analysis 
will be performed using an  alpha of 0.05 (two -sided test). The statistical significance in favor of 
the best -GS010 treated eyes against the best -sham eyes will show evidence of the advantage of 
using GS010 for halting visual acuity loss or imp roving visual acuity in subjects with LHON. 
The difference in the mean change from baseline (adjusted mean difference) between th e two 
treatment groups and associated 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
The center will not be included in the analysis  as the number of subjects recruited per site will be 
very small. However, stratification by [CONTACT_605779] a s ensitivity 
analysis. Neighboring countries can be pooled together to reach at least [ADDRESS_802263]-s ham eyes.

Thickness/Volume and Topographical Map  
The change of GCL  thickness/volume and topographical map and other parameters measured by  
[CONTACT_66309]-OCT (e.g., retinal nerve fib er layer) from baseline to each follow -up visit will be based on 
mixed -effects ANCOVA , including the subject and the eyes of the subject as random factors, the 
treatment and the baseline GCL  thickness/volume as covariates in the model. The analysis will 
be performed using an  alpha of 0.05  (two-sided test). The difference in the mean change from 
baseline (adjusted mean difference) to each follow -up visit b etween the two trea tment groups (all -
GS010 vs all-sham) and associated 95% confid ence interval will be reported.  
The analysis will also be performed for the best -GS010 treated eyes compared to best -sham eyes; 
and worst -GS010 treated eyes compared to worst -sham eyes. The analysis will be similar to the 
FDA analysis of change of LogMAR  from baseline to the follow-up visits. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Responder Analysis  
Eye responder and subject responder are defined in Section 8.2.2. 
Responder analyses at  all the follow -up visits will  compar e all-GS010 eyes against all -sham eyes  
based on a McNemar test . The analysis will  also be performed to compare  best-GS010 eyes 
again st best -sham eyes and worst -GS010 eyes against worst -sham  eyes using the Fisher e xact 
test. 
For the subject responder endpoint, randomization test will be performed  for each of  the follow -
up visits. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Time C ourse Analysis 
Time course analysis will compare time course of the response up to Visit 5 (Year 5) using 
MMRM (Mixed Model Repeated Measure) procedure. The change from baseline in the LogMAR  
and change from baseline in log of contrast sensitivity (LogCS ) will be the response s. The change 
from ba seline of all -GS010 eyes will be compared to the change from baseline of all -sham eyes 
using a MMRM including the subject and the eyes of the subject as random factors, t he treatment, 
follow-up v isit, eye status at baseline (better or worse), interaction b etween baseline values and 
treatment, interaction between linear time from onset of disease and treatment, in teraction 
between eye status at baseline and treatment, interaction between linear time  and treatment and 
baseline LogMAR as predictors in the mode l. The estimate of treatment effect at various follow -
up time points and its 95% confidence interval (CI) (without adjustment for multiplicit y) will be 
presented. Compound symmetry  structure will be fitted. In case of any convergence problem with 
this covariance structure, other covariance structures will be used. 
Time course analysis of Humphrey visual field parameters and SD -OCT parameters will be 
conducted similarly to  the time course analysis of LogMAR (details will be provided in the SAP).  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Humphrey Visual Field Parameters  
Mean  deviation in decibels of sensitivity and foveal threshold  sensitivities at all the follow -up 
visits and change from baseline to each follow -up visit will be summarized by [CONTACT_21129] -GS010 eyes 
against all -sham eyes; best -GS010 eyes against best -sham eyes; and worst -GS010 eyes against

Study data are not to be imputed  directly into the eCRF, but must be collected first in primary 
source documents at the clinical site. Completion of source documents will pr ecede the 
completion of t he eCRF. Source documents may be electronic, hard copy, or a combination of 
both. Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activit ies of a 
clinical investigation. They include, but are not limited to, progress notes, elec tronic data, 
screening logs, telephone interviews, and recorded data from automated instruments. All source  
documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_605781] e available for 
direct inspection by [CONTACT_605782]. The eCRF will be 
considered the source document for individual CRF elements such as study -specific scales if 
those data are collected directly onto a CRF.  
Data collection will be completed according to the guidelines provided by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor or its 
designee in writing. All required data are to be recorded using the source documents for  every 
subject who signed an informed consent. Site staff will be trained on the eCRF completion 
guidelines and requirements for source documentation.

should continue in the study. The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will 
document this decision. 
14.5 Contractual and Financial Details 
The Investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605756]) and the Sponsor 
will sign a clinical study agreement prior to the start of the study, outlining o verall Sponsor and 
Investigator responsibilities in relation to the study. The contract sho uld describe whether costs for 
pharmacy, laboratory and other protocol -required services are being paid directly or indirectly.  
The disclosure of any financial interests from each Investigator or sub -Investigator is required for 
this study, including financial interests of the spouse and each dependent chil d of the Investigator 
who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects tha t could affect the 
reliability of data submitted  to regulatory authorities. Financial Disclosure Statements will need 
to be completed, as requested by [CONTACT_30384] 21 P art 54  for all US Investigators; and by [CONTACT_605792] a New Drug Applic ation in the US. 
ICH requires that the clinical Investigator make all clinical trial -related records available for 
direct access by [CONTACT_2689] , auditor, IRB, or regulatory agency  and that financial aspects of the trial 
be in the Investigator's files. The FDA currently does not  require financial records or mandate 
"direct access" (312.62). 
14.6 Insurance, Indemnity , and Compensation 
GenSight undertakes to maintain an appropriate clinical study insurance policy. Deviations from 
the study protocol— especially the prescription of a dose other than that scheduled in the study 
protocol, other modes of administration, other indications, and longer treatment periods —are not 
permitted and shall not be covered by [CONTACT_605793].  
14.7 Investigational Site File Management 
The Investigator is responsible for assuring that the Investigational Site Central  File is maintained. 
The Site Central File will contain, but will not be limited to, the information listed as follows: 
(1) Investigator’s Brochu re; 
(2) Current, signed version of the protocol; 
(3) Protocol amendments (if applicable); 
(4) Operations Manual (if applicable);  
(5) Current ICF (blank); 
(6) Curricula Vitae of Investigator(s) and sub -investigator(s) and photocopy of their respective 
license(s) where required  by [CONTACT_2371];  Original US FDA Form 1572 (for all studies conducted 
under US IND regulations), signed by [CONTACT_282457]. The names of  any sub -
investigators must appear on this form. Investigators must also complete all  regulatory 
documentation as required the ICH GCP and by [CONTACT_29693]; 
(7) Documentation of IRB/IEC  approval of the protocol, the ICF, any protocol amendments, 
and any ICF revisions; 
(8) All correspondence between the Investigator, IRB/IEC , and the  Sponsor/CRO relating to

of subjects, and justified on either medical or ethical grounds. In terminating the  study, GenSight, 
the CRO (PRA) and the Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is gi ven to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests. 
14.9 Clinical Study Report  
A final clinical study report will be prepared according to the ICH Guideline on Structur e and 
Contents of Clinical Study Reports. A final clinical study report will be pr epared regardless of 
whether the study is completed or prematurely terminated. The Sponsor will provi de each 
Investigator with a copy of the final report for retention. 
14.10  Publi cation Policy 
After completion of the study, the Investigator(s) may prepare a joint publicati on with the 
Sponsor. The Investigator(s) must undertake not to submit any part of the data from thi s protocol 
for publication without the prior consent of GenSigh t.

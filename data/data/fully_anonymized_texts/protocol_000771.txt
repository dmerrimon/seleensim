Protocol Number/Title CASE 6316 A Phase II Study of the Addition of 
Pembrolizumab to Postoperative Radiotherapy in Resected 
High Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and 
Neck 
Study Phase II  
Brief Background/Rationale  
 
 
 While outcomes in resected cutaneous squamous carcinomas 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_537554], a subset of high risk resected 
cancers in the head and neck have a more aggressive disease 
course despi[INVESTIGATOR_537555].  This 
trial is a treatment intensification protocol which seeks to 
establish the safety and efficacy of concurrent and adjuvant 
Pembrolizumab in combination with radiation in the 
adjuvant treatment of high risk cutaneous squamous cell 
cancer of the head and neck.   
Primary Objective  To assess safety (% of DLTs) and estimate 1-year PFS of 
postoperative RT + concurrent and adjuvant Pembrolizumab 
in high risk resected cSCC-HN.  
Secondary Objective(s) Patterns of Failure  
Correlative Objective(s) 
 1) T o evaluate the relationship of baseline PD-L1 
expression by [CONTACT_537571]-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) to preliminary efficacy. 
2) To phenotype tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), and 
investigate tumor suppressor populations including 
Tregs, MDSCs and CD8 suppressor cells and assess 
ex vivo for effector function by [CONTACT_537572].   
3) To evaluate the tumor microenvironment (TME), 
and immune markers at the invasive margin of the 
tumor, including CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, 
galectin-9 or HMGB-1, BTLA and HVEM, as well 
as Lag-3, CTLA-4 and others. 
4) To evaluate the genomic and/or transcriptomic 
profile of these tumors using RNA-seq /Whole 
Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing

 2.0 TRIAL DESIGN 
2.1 Trial Design 
•  This is a phase II trial evaluating the addition of concurrent and adjuvant fixed-dose 
pembrolizumab in combination with standard IMRT, in order to establish safety and 
estimate efficacy of this regimen to be tested in a subsequent randomized registration trial. 
Thirty seven patients will be enrolled.  
• The primary safety endpoint will be proportion of DLTs. The primary efficacy endpoint will 
be 1-year PFS. The primary signal to move forward with a subsequent confirmatory 
randomized study will be a 24% overall DLT rate and a favorable 1yr PFS estimat e 
compared to historical controls.

 cells and assess ex vivo for effector function by [CONTACT_537573].   
7) For those participants for whom tumor tissue is available, we will evaluate the tumor 
microenvironment (TME), and immune markers at the invasive margin of the tumor, 
including CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, galectin-9 or HMGB-1, BTLA and HVEM, as well 
as Lag-3, CTLA-4 and others.   
8) If sufficient tumor is available, we will also evaluate the genomic and/or transcriptomic 
profile of a subset of tumors using RNA-seq /Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing    
 
Hypotheses :   
1) Baseline PD-L1 expression will not be associated with 1yr PFS. 
2) Peripheral immune profiles on PBMC will dynamically change from baseline through 
treatment and after completion of therapy and correlate with 1yr PFS.  
3) Changes in the TME at the marginal edge of the tumor will correlate with 1yr PFS and be 
marker dependent. 
4) Baseline genomic/proteomic tumor profiles will correlate with 1yr PFS

4.1.[ADDRESS_700238] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation 
has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies.  In particular, 
the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells 
seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD-[ADDRESS_700239] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to 
CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2).  The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved.  
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     12 
 PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable-type 
(V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the 
binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases 
SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of 
effector molecules such as CD3 , PKC and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T-cell sign aling 
cascade.  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]-[ADDRESS_700240] 
from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD-1 was 
shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-
cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development 
on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The 
ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of 
cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors .  Both ligands are type 
I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and 
contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_700241] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 
protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid 
organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral tissues.  
Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to 
express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-specific 
T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway 
plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for 
therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 
and PD-L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.

4.[ADDRESS_700242] Population 
Disease Background: 
Cutaneous squamous cell cancer (cSCC) is the second most common cancer in the U.S. with an 
estimated incidence of over 700,[ADDRESS_700243] are highly curable with surgery 
alone, there is a well-recognized subset of patients who demonstrate an aggressive clinical phenotype 
marked by [CONTACT_537574]/or distant metastatic spread.  These patients are 
overwhelmingly comprised of cSCC of the head and neck (cSCC-HN), and frequently demonstrate 
high risk features including large T3/4 tumors, nodal involvement, lymphovascular space invasion, 
perineural invasion, and multiply recurrent disease.2  In a recent population based study, as many as 
5,600 patients were estimated to develop nodal metastases and up to 8,700 deaths were attributable 
to cSCC.1  Postoperative radiotherapy has been shown in a number of studies to reduce locoregional 
recurrence and in some studies improve overall survival in this disease.3-6  However, there are 
currently no randomized data supporting the use of systemic therapy concurrently and/or adjuvantly 
to RT, and significant failure rates, both locoregionally and distantly, underscore the limited 
treatment options for these patients and the need for intensification strategies in addition to RT.   
While radiation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a highly effective treatment for both cutaneous and mucosal SCC of the 
head and neck, a mechanism of radioresistance that is becoming increasingly clarified is the tumor 
microenvironment altering and inhibiting the innate immune response of the host.  As a result of 
recruitment of inhibitory immune cells (e.g. Tregs; activated macrophages), T-cell activation is 
suppressed and treatment resistance emerges.  PD-1 is expressed by [CONTACT_537575] (e.g. 
cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells) and when coupled with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, the 
complex promotes “immune escape” in a number of cancers. 7 7, 13, 14    In mucosal head and neck 
cancer specifically, PD-L1 expression is common, and has been demonstrably linked to the immune-
privileged, invasive front of HPV + SCC.8,9 A recently completed Phase Ib/II study in mucosal head 
and neck cancer supported this hypothesis as Pembrolizumab, a high-affinity IgG4 mAb which 
blocks the interaction of PD-1 with both PD-L1 and PD-L2, produced impressive response rates 
(20% by [CONTACT_13407]) in heavily pretreated recurrent/metastatic patients.10  
Cutaneous SCC of the head and neck shares many parallels with mucosal SCC as they are both 
considered to be more prevalent in “immune-weakened” states. While mucosal disease demonstrates 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     14 
 defective antigen presenting cells (APC), and quantitative and qualitative T lymphocyte deficiencies, 
skin cancer is a disease of aging as older, less robust immune systems become less effective at 
preventing sun damaged mutated skin cells from cancerization.11,12 There is early emerging work 
implicating PD-1 in particular in cutaneous SCC pathways. A recent study demonstrated that immune 
neutralization of PD-1+ cells resulted in decreased papi[INVESTIGATOR_537556]4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates, as well as increased interferon-  and decreased transforming 
growth factor- production within tumors, supporting the role of PD -1 blockade in SCCS.13   Another 
study associates a higher incidence of seropositivity to particular strains of papi[INVESTIGATOR_537557] a potential mechanism for the increased incidence in cSCC in these patients, 
highlighting an important potential overlap between cSCC-HN and mucosal head and neck cancer, 
known to be frequently HPV induced.14  
Radiotherapy induces immune responses by [CONTACT_537576], recruiting chemokines and 
making cells more vulnerable to T-cell killing.15  PD-L1 upregulation following RT in the tumor 
microenvironment has been recently demonstrated, and inhibiting its activity using anti-PD-L1 
treatment enhanced the effectiveness of RT via a cytotoxic T-cell dependent mechanism.16   A recent 
landmark study in melanoma analyzed samples from 46 patients treated with Pembrolizumab and 
found that tumor regression after therapeutic PD-1 blockade required pre-existing CD8(+) T cells 
that are negatively regulated by [CONTACT_4002]-1/PD-L1-mediated adaptive immune resistance.[ADDRESS_700244] in particular, 
being highly associated with carcinogenesis and response to RT provides a sound basis to pursue 
PD-1 blockade in high risk cSCC-HN.  
   
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
 
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) was condu cted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity 
of single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  
This first in human study of MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective 
evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No 
MTD has been identified to date.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 
program has shown that a lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient 
for target engagement and clinical activity. 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     15 
  
PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 
release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  A population 
pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_700245] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The 
differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight 
based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 
for MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar 
efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W 
(i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no 
significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the 
NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure 
between different indication settings. 
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid 
tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg 
or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 
3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab 
target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose 
of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained 
with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure 
range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain 
individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated 
and safe.  
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700246] demonstrated enhanced radiosensitization with the administration of 
Pembrolizumab prior to the initiation of radiotherapy (Personal communication: Robert Ferris MD, 
PhD).  As such, the initial dose of Pembrolizumab will be given in this study the week prior to the 
beginning of IMRT.  This is consistent with other trials investigating the combination of PD-[ADDRESS_700247] IMRT.  
21 patients (78%) completed all planned doses of Pembrolizumab. 3 discontinued due to irAEs (G2 
peripheral motor neuropathy, G3 AST elevation, G1 Lhermitte-like syndrome). 3 discontinued due 
to protocol reasons (early neck dissection -2 pts, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]-1 pt). All pts completed 
the full radiation dose (70 Gy) without significant delay (defined as > 5 days). 23 (85%) received the 
goal target dose of cisplatin ( 200 mg/m2). There was one patient death due to concu rrent illness, 
unrelated to treatment.18  Based on these results, the NRG Oncology HN-003 study which was 
designed as a phase I safety study of the addition of Pembrolizumab to postoperative head and neck 
IMRT and weekly cisplatin discontinued their planned phase I safety study and converted to an open 
label efficacy signal study.  We therefore feel quite confident in the safety of our proposed regimen 
as our study involves less extensive IMRT fields and does not include any concurrent chemotherapy.  
We will however monitor DLTs very carefully and include that as a co-primary endpoint of the study. 
 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Endpoints 
1yr PFS in this patient cohort is suboptimal, and an important measure of disease control.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Endpoints 
The primary safety endpoints for this study will be dose limiting toxicity (DLT).  DLT for this study 
is defined as the occurrence of a severe adverse event (AE) listed below that is at least possibly  
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     17 
 related to pembrolizumab, and occurs from the initiation of treatment thru 30 days after the final 
administration of the study treatment.  AEs will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0.  
At the completion of the study, a total DLT rate will be assessed.  A DLT rate of <24% will be 
deemed acceptable and if met, the regimen will be deemed appropriate for future study in randomized 
studies.   
The following events will be considered a DLT:  
• Any  Grade 3  immune-related toxicity (including graft r ejection), except: 
o Grade 3 dermatologic toxicity resolving to Grade 1 or lower with < 2 weeks of 
systemic immunosuppression 
• Any   Grade 3 non hematologic toxicity e xcept : 
o Grade 3 in-field radiation dermatitis for which IMRT is not held or held  1 week (5 
f
ractions) 
o Grade 3 mucositis for which IMRT is not held or is held   1 week (5 fractions) 
o A
symptomatic Grade 3-4 hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia 
o Grade 3 fatigue 
o Grade 3 dysphagia or feeding tube use 
o Grade 3 weight loss 
o Grade 3 pain 
• Grade 3 neutropenia with fever (oral temperature > 39°C) 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding 
• Grade 4 neutropenia with/without fever, requiring antibiotics 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
• Toxicity of any grade that results in inability to complete IMRT within 8 weeks 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  R ationale for Correlative Endpoints/Biomarker Research 
 
Central hypothesis:  C utaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is responsive to combination of 
PD-[ADDRESS_700248] our hypothesis correlatively we propose the following aims: 
 
Aim 1. To correlate baseline PD-1 expression in the tumor with disease related outcomes. 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     18 
 Rationale: It is unknown whether patients with tumors that express higher levels of PD-1 
preferentially respond compared to those that do not.  As such, this will be systematically evaluated 
on all patients. 
Research Plan :   FFPE tissue blocks will be collected from patients and slides will be cut for 
subsequent biomarker staining. Analysis of PD-L1 expression will be performed by 
[CONTACT_537577].  Either complete circumferential or partial 
linear plasma membrane staining will constitute positive PD-L1 staining.  A cut-off of  5% tumor 
c
ell membrane staining will be reported as positive. 
 
Aim 2. To define response to radiation/PD-1 inhibition based on tumor microenvironment 
and peripheral blood alterations in patients with CSCC. 
Rationale:   Many solid tumors do respond to checkpoint inhibitors.  Little is known in regards to 
CSCC patients who will or will not respond to the proposed treatment regimen of post-operative 
radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy.   
Research Plan:   Prospectively we will stratify study patients into two groups: those that do, or do 
not respond to the proposed therapy based on historical published data from our institution.  The 
following are the proposed assays for evaluation. 
 
A. Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes  
Flow cytometry:  Peripheral blood samples drawn from patients pretreatment and at specified times 
post treatment will be isolated by [CONTACT_7891].  Surface biomarker expression will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_537578]-resident lymphocytes.  Staining will evaluate  CD3, CD4, 
CD8 expression as well as cytotoxic markers (perforin, FasL, Granzyme A&B,  markers of 
dysfunction/exhaustion  (PD-1, TIM-3, Lag-3), and  markers characteristic of regulatory cells 
(Foxp3, CD25, GITR, CD27, CD28) and markers for myeloid derived suppressor cells.  Finally, 
we will assess TCR clonal diversity using PCR methods. 
 
 
B. Tissue 
Patients for whom fresh tissue is available (e.g. if they consented to other tissue banking IRB 
approved protocols such as IRB 3164 or 15-1580) or for whom FFPE is available, may have some 
or all of the following additional correlative studies performed, depending on tissue availability.  
These include: 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     19 
 Immunohistochemistry:  Tumor tissues will be stained and evaluated for indicators of inflammation 
including the relative degree of lymphocyte infiltration and characterization of immune populations 
via expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8, as well as the expression of various regulatory-associated 
markers including PD-1, PDL-1, and galectin-9. 
Flow cytometry:  tumor tissue will be disassociated by [CONTACT_537579]/hyaluronidase, 
prior to FACS analysis of immune population phenotype including CD3, CD4, CD8, and the 
following cytotoxic markers:  perforin, FasL, Granzyme.  Studies will also evaluate markers of 
dysfunction/exhaustion including PD-1, TIM-3, Lag-3, TIGIT and markers associated with 
regulatory cells/suppression including Foxp3, GITR, CD25, CD27, and CD28 and markers for 
myeloid derived suppressor cells.  Finally, we will assess TCR clonal diversity using PCR 
methods. 
Cytoxicity assays: Tumor resident CD3+CD8+ T cells will be purified by [CONTACT_537580]/or general functional ability.  
Readouts will include proliferation (CFSE dilution, 3-H thymidine incorporation), cytotoxicity (51-
Cr release, CD107a staining), and production of interferon gamma and IL-2. 
Gene expression analysis: Tumor tissue specimens will be checked by a pathologist to ensure that 
each contains at least 60% tumor content.  Total RNA will then be isolated from [ADDRESS_700249]:

therapy within the last 3 months) will be eligible. Patients with chronic lymphoid or 
leukemic malignancies are eligible with or without active disease as long as they have 
not had treatment within the past three months. 
5) Patients may not have had prior therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor (e.g. anti-CTLA-4, 
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy);  
6) Patients may not have had prior radiotherapy (>30Gy) to the area requiring treatment 
that would result in any overlap of tissue in both fields 
7) Patients may have received chemotherapy or radiation for a previous, curatively treated 
malignancy provided at least [ADDRESS_700250] elapsed and there is no current evidence of 
disease (patients with previous or concurrent additional skin cancers will be eligible).  
Patients with chronic lymphoid or leukemic malignancies are eligible with or without 
active disease as long as they have not had treatment within the past three months.

 The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 – Background 
and Rationale.   
Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification  
 
Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associ ated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or 
several months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug-related 
toxicities and severe or life-threatening AEs as per Table [ADDRESS_700264]

Note: Permanently discontinue for any severe or Grade [ADDRESS_700268] dose.  Note: Pembrolizumab does not 
need to be held for grade 3 dysphagia, grade 3 pain, grade 3 weight loss, or grade 3 fatigue, which are expected 
toxicities for head and neck radiation and will be managed aggressively by [CONTACT_537582]. 
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not 
related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or 
holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be 
documented in the patient's study record. 
5.2.[ADDRESS_700269] dose of Pemrbolizumab should be administer ed week 1, the week prior to the beginning of 
radiotherapy (5-10 days preRT is acceptable).  RT will begin the week after the initial infusion of 
Pembrolizumab, typi[INVESTIGATOR_94705] a Monday or Tuesday.  Trial treatment should be administered as per 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     26 
 the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons. All trial treatments will be 
administered on an outpatient basis. 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites should 
make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given 
the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is 
permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). 
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. 
5.2.3 Trial Blinding/Masking 
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the treatment 
administered.

a 20% overall DLT rate and a favorable 1yr PFS compare d to historical controls.  
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during 
the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be 
required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team.  
The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the 
subject's primary physician.  
5.5.[ADDRESS_700271]’s welfare may be administered 
at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All 
concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, 
over-the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur during 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700272] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined 
in Section 7.2. 
5.5.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130970] (including retreatment for post-complete response relapse) of this trial: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab 
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_700273] dose of trial treatment and while participating 
in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other 
medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary. 
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial. 
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Treatment Follow-up Phase. 
5.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
5.6.1 Supportive Care Guidelines 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in the ECI guidance 
document. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     28 
 symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed to 
follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in 
the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 5.2.1 for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, can 
be found in the ECI guidance document. 
• Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks. 
o For Grade 3-4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer 
additional anti-inflammatory measures, as needed. 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration. 
 
 
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1 week, treat with intravenous 
steroids followed by [CONTACT_78018].

 o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or  
G
rade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA) 
 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3-4  Hyperglycemia 
 I nsulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and 
for Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 E valuate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide.  
 
• Hypophysitis : 
 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
o For Grade 3-4  events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 
 
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4  hypothyroidism): 
 I n hyperthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.

or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3-4  hyperthyroidism  
 T reat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
 
 
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly). 
 T reat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
o For Grade 3-4  events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
• Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. 
o For Grade 3-4  events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of 
infusion.

5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
5.7.[ADDRESS_700275]-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are 
considered highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically 
sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater 
t
han 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of 
the study.  The two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus 
a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from study Visit 
[ADDRESS_700276] dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by 
[CONTACT_3969]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives 
will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a 
progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents). 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     33 
 Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study they 
must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and 
during the follow-up period defined in section 7.2.2-Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006].  If there is any question that a subject will not reliably comply with the 
requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study. 
5.7.[ADDRESS_700277]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., 
death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother 
or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the 
pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described above and in Section 
7.2.2.

5.8 IMRT 
IMRT will be delivered in 30 fractions over 6 weeks (five fractions per non-holiday week) in one 
plan (SIB) to a total dose of 60-66Gy. Missed treatments due to holidays or logistic reasons can be 
compensated for by [CONTACT_181614], OR treating on the 
Saturday or Sunday of that week, OR adding to the end of treatment.

Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700280] be performed with the immobilization device and in the 
treatment position. Slice thickness should be 0.3 cm or thinner. 
5.8.2 Target Delineation 
There should be no Gross Tumor Volume (GTV).  The Clinical Target Volume (CTV_60) is 
defined as the tumor and/or lymph node bed that was dissected.  All patients must have a CTV_60.  
There are two optional CTVs that can be used. Elective areas deemed at risk of subclinical disease 
that have not been dissected (e.g. elective nodes) can be treated to a lower dose of 54Gy (CTV_54).  
For areas of highest risk, such as positive margins, or extranodal extension, a high risk CTV 
(CTV_66) can be used to focally boost these areas in a simultaneous fashion.  This treatment 
volumes should be kept as small as possible.  
The Planning Target Volume (PTV_60) should be a 3mm expansion around CTV_60.  If additional 
CTV’s are used, they should have their own PTV (e.g. CTV_54 PTV_54) with a 3mm margin.  
I
n general, as the skin is the origin of disease, it will often be targeted.  In these cases, the PTV 
should be allowed to extend outside of the external skin surface and 5mm of custom bolus must be 
used.  When the skin is not part of the target, then the PTV can be shaved out of skin by 3-5mm to 
enhance planning capabilities.   
 All plans must be normalized such that 95% of the volume of the PTV_60 is covered with 
prescription dose of 60 Gy. Additionally: At 1 cc PTV1 volume on the DVH curve, the dose 
should not be > 110% of the prescribed dose.  At a volume of 0.03 cc within the PTV_60 
volume on the DVH curve, the dose should not be < 95% of the prescribed dose. For any volume 
of tissue outside the PTVs that has a size of 1 cc, the dose should not be > [ADDRESS_700281], and will 
be determined on a case by [CONTACT_413].  In general, for tumors of the scalp, if lymphatics are 
targeted, they should include: occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307], parotid, anterior cervical (levels 2-4), and posterior cervical 
(level 5) nodes. When targeting lymph nodes for tumors of the face (e.g. nose, cheek, temple, 
eyelid, lip): parotid, anterior cervical (levels 2-4), and submandibular (level 1B) should be 
included.  For ear tumors, pre and post-auricular nodes should be included in addition to parotid, 
anterior cervical (levels 2-4), and posterior cervical  nodes.   
For patients with perineural invasion of named nerves, these nerves should be included in the 
elective CTV_54 to their origin of the skull base.   For those with extensive involvement or 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     35 
 proximal involvement adjacent to the skull base, the involved nerves should be targeted bach to the 
respective nerve ganglion (e.g. Meckel cave for the Gasserion ganglion of the trigeminal nerve). 
5.8.[ADDRESS_700282], cochlea mandible, glottic larynx, supraglottis, 
constrictors, esophagus, trachea, oral cavity, lips and parotid and submandibular salivary glands 
that are not at risk.  For tumors of the scalp and other requiring treatment of the skull base, the 
following should also be included: eyes, lenses, optic nerves, optic chiasm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], 
hypothalamus.  The PRV (planning risk volume) spi[INVESTIGATOR_399014] 0.[ADDRESS_700283] (i.e. the cord diameter on any given slice will 
be 1.[ADDRESS_700284] itself ).  
5.8.[ADDRESS_700285] (ROI) or “clip box” for fusion should be set to 
encompass the high dose PTV and adjacent spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].   When the skull base is targeted, the 
globes and optic nerves should routinely be included, if possible, for alignment purposes.  
Following the registration, the translational and (if the appropriate technology is available) 
rotational corrections should be applied to the treatment couch. If all the variances are less than 
10 mm (this typi[INVESTIGATOR_537560]), the treatment can proceed 
with appropriate corrections; however, re-imaging is not mandatory. If one or more of the 
corrections are larger than [ADDRESS_700286] be repeated in addition to performing 
table/positioning adjustments. However, the use of numerous repeat IGRT studies should be 
avoided (see next section). 
 
5.8.6 Definition of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs) 
NOTE:  Only the parts of the normal tissues/organs at risk outside the PTVs will be 
considered for dose optimization purposes. Only those OAR that are in proximity to the 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700287] : The cord begins at the cranial-cervical junction (i.e. the top of the C1 vertebral 
body). Superior to this is brainstem and inferior to this is cord. The inferior border of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_357319] T3-4 (i.e., just below the lowest slice level that has PTV on it). 
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_306396]. In addition, however, 
a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spi[INVESTIGATOR_181589]. The PRVcord = cord + 5 mm in 
each dimension. This is irrespective of whether or not IGRT is used. 
Brainstem : The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cranial-cervical junction where it 
meets the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. For the purposes of this study, the superior most portion of the brainstem 
is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior clinoid. The brainstem shall be defined 
based on the treatment planning CT scan.  In addition, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) 
brainstem shall be defined. The PRVbrainstem = brainstem + 3 mm in each dimension. 
Lips and Oral Cavity :  These should be contoured as 2 separate structures as the goal is to keep 
the lip dose much lower than the oral cavity dose. The definition of lips is self-explanatory. The 
oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure consisting of the anterior ½ to 2/3 of 
the oral tongue/floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and palate. 
OARpharynx/constrictors :  This  will  be  defined  as  the  “uninvolved”  posterior  pharyngeal  
wall  plus adjacent constrictor muscles. This extends from the superior constrictor region (the 
inferior pterygoid plates level) to the cricopharyngeal inlet (posterior cricoid cartilage level). 
Cervical Esophagus : This will be defined as a tubular structure that starts at the bottom of 
OARpharynx and extends to the thoracic inlet. 
Glottic/Supraglottic Larynx (GSL) : This will be defined as a “triangular prism shaped” volume 
that begins just inferior to the hyoid bone and extends to the cricoid cartilage inferiorly and 
extends from the anterior commissure to include the arytenoids. This includes the infrahyoid but 
not suprahyoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050]. 
Mandible : This includes the entire boney structure of the mandible from TMJ through the 
symphysis. 
Other structures (self explanatory): Optic Nerves, optic chiasm, orbits, lenses, cochlea, lacrimal 
glands, parotid glands, submandibular glands 
Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets : This will be defined as tissue located between the skull 
base and thoracic inlet that is not included in either the target volumes or the normal tissues 
described above. 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     37 
  
5.8.7 Dose Prescription 
Doses to PTVs 
See Section 5.8.2 above for definitions of CTVs and PTVs and their prescribed doses. The goal 
is for 95% of the PTV60 to receive   2 Gy with a minimum dose (cold spot) of no less tha n [ADDRESS_700288] at a depth deeper than 8 mm beneath the skin.  For PTV_66, 
when used, 95% of the volume should get the prescription dose, and <0.03cc should receive 
>110% of the dose.  This criteria does not apply for PTV_54 when used.    
Doses to Normal Structures  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]:  The PRVcord should not exceed  50 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 
cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). In treatment planning, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_537561]. 
Brainstem : The brainstem  should not exceed 56 Gy to any volume in excess of 0.03 cc 
(approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm).  The PRVbrainstem (brainstem +3mm) should be 
limited to 60Gy.  These can be exceeded in cases where the tumor abutted the brainstem and 
was resected.  Max point dose to the brainstem can never exceed 62Gy.   
Optic Nerves and Chiasm : These should be limited to a max dose of 54Gy. 
Orbits : Should be limited to a max dose of 50Gy with 95% <45Gy.  These doses may be 
exceeded when the tumor is abutting the globe preoperatively and is adjacent to the 
postoperative bed.  The max dose to 0.03cc of the globe can never exceed 52Gy.   
Lacrimal Gland : This should be limited to a mean <30Gy whenever possible.  This may be 
exceeded when the tumor location approximated this structure preoperatively and is 
subsequently at risk or adjacent to the tumor bed.   
Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be < 20 Gy 
when possible. 
Oral Cavity:  Reduce the dose as much as possible. The mean dose should be < 30 Gy 
when possible.   
Parotid Glands (not targeted) : In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than the 
other. The treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid gland to receive a 
mean dose of <26 Gy.   
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     38 
 Submandibular gland (not targeted) : If level Ib is not a target, aim to reduce mean 
contralateral submandibular gland to < 39 Gy. 
OARpharynx/constrictors : Reduce the dose as much as possible. Some recommended (but 
not mandatory) treatment goals include: 1) No more than 33% of the OARpharynx exceeds 
50Gy; 2) Mean dose < 45 Gy; 3) No more than 15% of the OARpharynx exceeds 60 Gy. 
Cervical Esophagus : Reduce the dose as much as possible.  Some recommended (but 
treatment goals include: Mean dose < 30 Gy. 
Glottic and Supraglottic larynx (GSL) : Reduce the dose as much as possible. The glottic 
larynx m e a n  dose is recommended to be <25 Gy.  
Mandible: Reduce the dose as much as possible.  Hot spots within the mandible should be 
avoided. It is recommended that maximum dose within the mandible be < 66 Gy, except in 
areas overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_127105]. 
Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets : No more than 1cc of unspecified tissue outside the 
targets can receive 70 Gy or more
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700289] treatment interruptions in 
radiation for >3 weeks will be taken off study. The interruption of radiation therapy for grade 
4 mucositis / dermatitis / dysphagia is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. 
Treatment breaks, if necessary, ideally should not exceed five treatment days at a time and 
ten treatment days total. Treatment breaks should be allowed only for resolution of severe 
acute toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness and not for social or logistical reasons.  
Pembrolizumab will not be administered during radiotherapy treatment breaks. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_700290] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the 
trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details 
regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures. 
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons: 
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent. 
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 7.2 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements 
• The subject is lost to follow-up 
• Administrative reasons

7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES 
7.1 Trial Procedures 
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. 
 
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent 
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial. 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     44

acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation 
in the trial. 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and 
any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [CONTACT_90096] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature. 
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.   
The informed consent will a 
dhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and Sponsor requirements. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by [CONTACT_26358].

will include all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior [ADDRESS_700295] has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as medical 
history.   
 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     45 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications Review 
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any 
protocol-specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by [CONTACT_49880] [ADDRESS_700296] 
during the trial.  All medications related to reportable SAEs and ECIs should be recorded as 
defined in Section 7.2. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Disease Details and Treatment 
 
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain p rior and current details regarding disease 
status.  
     [IP_ADDRESS]       Prior Treatment Details 
 
The investigator or qualified designee will review a ll prior cancer treatments including 
systemic treatments, radiation and surgeries. 
     [IP_ADDRESS]        Subsequent Anti-Cancer Therapy Status 
 
The investigator or qualified designee will review a ll new anti-neoplastic therapy initiated after 
the last dose of trial treatment.  If a subject initiates a new anti-cancer therapy within [ADDRESS_700297] will 
move into survival follow-up.  
 
7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring 
 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess e ach subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow-
up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 11.2).  Toxicities will be 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700298] (ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune-related adverse 
events, or irAEs); see the separate ECI guidance document in Appendix 4 regarding the 
identification, evaluation and management of potential irAEs.   
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Exam 
 
The investigators or qualified designee will perform  a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history.  A full physical exam should be performed during screening.  For all other study visits, 
including those performed immediately prior to treatment administration, focused physical 
exams are acceptable. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs 
 
The investigator or qualified designee will take vit al signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in 
the Trial Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 
 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess E COG status (see Section 11.1) at screening, 
prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment, discontinuation of trial treatment and 
at protocol specified follow up assessments, as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease 
As this is an adjuvant trial, there will be no anticipated measureable disease to record.  RECIST 
and other such response criteria do not apply.  However, there will be baseline imaging and 
surveillance imaging to evaluate for locoregional and distant recurrence as specified in the 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     47 
 Trial Flow Chart (section 6.0).  In the event of clinical or radiographic recurrence of disease, 
biopsy to confirm recurrent disease is strongly recommended.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood Sampling 
 
Tumor tissue will be sent to Qualtek for PD-1 testin g.  Blood will be collected on all patients 
at the times specified in the study flow chart (section 6.1) and sent to the Gastman lab for 
analysis.  Sufficient FFPE may be available from tumor samples to allow for additional 
correlative study.  Also, patients may have fresh tissue available for correlative study if they 
consented to a separate tissue banking protocol (e.g. IRB 3164 or 15-1580).  In these cases, 
additional experiments may be performed as outlined in section [IP_ADDRESS].  The consent form 
clearly states that blood will be collected for research purposes and that tumor tissue that is 
stored in pathology can be used for correlative science.    
7.1.3 Laboratory Procedures/Assessments 
Details regarding specific laboratory procedures/assessments to be performed in this trial are 
provided below.  Laboratory Safety Evaluations (Hematology, Chemistry and Urinalysis) 
Laboratory tests for hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and others are specified in Table 5.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation.  Any 
adverse events which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed 
in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 - Assessing and Recording 
Adverse Events.   
 
7.1.4 Visit Requirements 
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 - Trial Flow Chart.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening 
Potentially eligible patients will be screened according to the eligibility checklist.  Patients 
deemed ineligible, as well as those that are offered trial participation and decline enrollment 
will be recorded as “screen failures.” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period 
During the treatment period patients will be seen as follows: 
Weeks 1-6: patients will be seen in radiation oncology weekly for their SOC weekly on 
treatment visit. They will often be assessed in radiation oncology 2-[ADDRESS_700300] completion 
of radiotherapy for a routine toxicity check, but this is not mandated.  
Weeks 1-16: Patients will be seen by [CONTACT_537583].  Additional visits may be 
required during intervening weeks as clinically indicated, but are not mandatory. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow-Up Visits  
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700301] 
dose of trial treatment.  All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow-Up Visit should be 
recorded.  Subjects with an AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_700302] treatment follow up visit (week 20), patients will be seen around 
weeks [ADDRESS_700303] vital signs, weight, medical history, focused physical exam, lab evaluation, 
imaging,  ECOG performance status, and correlative blood samples (if applicable), as specified

7.[ADDRESS_700304] a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use 
of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event. 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700305], device, diagnostic 
agent or protocol-specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active 
comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_276276]. 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] product in clinical trials or 
within the follow-up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. 
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre-allocation baseline period 
as a result of a protocol-specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered 
to be drug related by [CONTACT_093]. 
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is 
described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or greater ( 5 times the indicated dose).  No specific informatio n is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs 
of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700306] (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1209])

the trial or within [ADDRESS_700308] be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, 
miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events).  If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to 
[COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_1209]) 
 
7.2.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of 
[COMPANY_006]’s product that: 
• Results in death; 
• Is life threatening; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;

initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a 
medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required 
regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700314] and the AE ; 
the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more 
likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE): 
 Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: reliable history, 
acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or 
measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
 Time 
Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug-induced effect (applies to trials with 
investigational medicinal product)? 
 Likely 
Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other 
drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors 
 
 
 
 
Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: 
(continued)  
to [COMPANY_006] 
product 
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the [COMPANY_006] product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced? 
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge. 
 
Protocol v 12/04/2019                                                                                                                                                     58 
 (Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the 
AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_130980]; or (3) the trial is a single-dose 
drug trial); or (4) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are only used one time.) 
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re-exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product in this study? 
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, 
or (2) the trial is a single-dose drug trial); or (3) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are used only one time). 
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS 
SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_80086], OR IF 
REEXPOSURE TO THE MERCK PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL 
SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED 
IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_64918] U.S. CLINICAL MONITOR AS PER DOSE MODIFICATION 
GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL. 
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the 
[COMPANY_006] product or drug class pharmacology or toxicology? 
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician 
according to his/her best clinical judgment, including consideration of the above elements. 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700315] one of the 
following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative 
of a [COMPANY_006] product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006]

 7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
7.2.6 Investigator Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
It is the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Principal Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that  
ALL serious adverse events are reported to the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Data Safety  
Toxicity Committee. This submission is simultaneous with their submission to the Sponsor or other  
Regulatory body.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_700316] IMRT, in order to establish safety and estimate 
efficacy of this regimen to be tested in a subsequent randomized registration trial. At the 
conclusion of the study, the primary safety endpoint will be proportion of DLT.  The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be 1-year PFS. Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from 
treatment initiation to disease progression or death from any cause or last follow up.   
8.2 Justification of Design and Sample Size:    
The target sample size will be 34 patients.  Assuming a <10% drop out or ineligibility rate, 37 patients 
will be enrolled to ensure 34 evaluable patients (all evaluable patients will be analyzed). The sample 
size was generated based on the primary safety endpoint.  DLT <20% is acceptable and >40% is 
unacceptable.  If 11 or more of 34 patients experience DLT, this regimen will be considered too 
toxic.  The significance level and power of this design are 6% and 86%, respectively.  If [ADDRESS_700317] 95% confidence interval.  If 11 or more patients experience 
DLT the regimen will be considered too toxic.  One-year PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method and a 95% confidence interval constructed using Greenwood’s method.  One year 
PFS outcomes will be assessed overall and also separately for immunocompetent patients vs. 
immunosuppressed patients (e.g. CLL).  These outcomes will be compared to our historical dataset 
for both subsets respectively.  Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_416815].  The rates of 
 
Protocol v 12/04/[ADDRESS_700318] 95% confidence.  The relationship between 1yr 
PFS and baseline PD-L1 expression will be assessed using logistic regression.  Immunoprofiles in 
peripheral blood in serial samples will be tested using random effects ANOVA.  Bioinformatic 
analysis will be applied to all genomic and transcriptomic data.

 Study #3 and #4: Fresh or FFPE Tissue for Immune Biomarker Analysis and Tumor Gene 
Expression Analysis (Optional) 
• For patients who consent to other IRB-approved tissue banking protocols: 
o Fresh tumor tissue will have been received, de-identified, processed and stored 
(frozen).  RNA isolation may have also taken place for gene expression analysis 
o This tissue may be sent to the Gastman lab for experimentation.   
• FFPE tissue may be obtained in patients for whom fresh tissue is not available: 
o FFPE tissue will be obtained from the Tissue Procurement (CC) or Biorepository 
(UH) tissue bank and assigned a unique identification number.  All other PHI will 
be redacted from the pathology report. 
o Up to 10 slides will be cut from each tissue block for immune biomarker staining  
o A small punch will be taken for RNA isolation for subsequent gene expression 
analysis 
• Results: Research laboratory personnel will report to [COMPANY_006] and study investigators.  
• Residual Material:  cryopreserved specimens, tissue slides, and genetic material will be 
retained by [CONTACT_537596].

Date Section Change 
08/03/17 2.1  Safety run in period and Phase II portion was deleted from this section  
08/03/17 4.2.2 The following was added to this section: 
 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_537570] 2017.  Powell, et al reported excellent safety profile 
of [ADDRESS_700337] IMRT.  21 patients 
(78%) completed all planned doses of Pembrolizumab. 3 discontinued 
due to irAEs (G2 peripheral motor neuropathy, G3 AST elevation, G1 
Lhermitte-like syndrome). 3 discontinued due to protocol reasons (early 
neck dissection -2 pts, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]-1 pt). All pts 
completed the full radiation dose (70 Gy) without significant delay 
(defined as > 5 days). 23 (85%) received the goal target dose of cisplatin 
(200 mg/m2). There was one patient death due to concu rrent illness, 
unrelated to treatment.18  Based on these results, the NRG Oncology 
HN-003 study which was designed as a phase I safety study of the 
addition of Pembrolizumab to postoperative head and neck IMRT and 
weekly cisplatin discontinued their planned phase I safety study and 
converted to an open label efficacy signal study.  We therefore feel quite 
confident in the safety of our proposed regimen as our study involves 
less extensive IMRT fields and does not include any concurrent 
chemotherapy.  We will however monitor DLTs very carefully and 
include that as a co-primary endpoint of the study.

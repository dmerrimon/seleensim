Prohibited 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13542]:  
 
TransCon PTH increases calcium, and therefore 
concomitant use with digoxin (which has a narrow 
therapeutic index) may predispose patients to  
digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. When 
TransCon PTH is used concomitantly with digoxin, 
measure serum calcium and digoxin levels, and 
monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.  The use of digoxin is 
permitted in the open 
label extension period 
if clinically indicated 
and should be used 
with caution as 
hypercalcemia may 
predispose the subject 
to digoxin toxicity.

PTH(1-84) is 10-65 pg/mL; as PTH(1-34) and 
PTH( 1-33) comprise about 40% of the molecular 
mass of the intact hormone, the calculated normal 
range is about 4 -26 pg/mL. 
A total of [ADDRESS_13055] 26 weeks duration treated with a stable dose of 
≥ 0.25 μg BID active vitamin D  (or ≥ 1.0 μg/day of 
alfacalcidol) and ≥[ADDRESS_13056]

1:1:1:1 to TransCon PTH 15, 18 or 21 μg/day or to 
placebo for 4 weeks, followed by [CONTACT_13606] -label extension for an additional 12 mont hs.  
Preliminary data up to 26 weeks of follow up are 
presently available.  
Analysis of 26 week data from the Phase 2 open 
label extension confirm these findings, with 91% 
of participants requiring no vitamin D and ≤500 
mg/d elemental calcium.  Participants required TransCon PTH doses between 6 and 39 
μg/day. 
No TEAEs related to abnormal serum calcium 
have required urgent medical attention.  No 
TEAEs have resulted in discontinuation of study 
drug, withdrawal from the trial or death.  There have been no S[LOCATION_003]Rs as
 of February 2021.  A

The 4 -week blinded treatment period of the 
Phase  2 trial (TransCon PTH TCP -201) with 
fixed doing of  TransCon PTH (15, 18, and 21  
µg/day) demonstrated that a dose of 18 µg/day 
was both effective and well -tolerated, with less 
hypercalcemia compared to a dose of 21 µg/day 
and without meaningful hypocalcemia. The Phase 
2 trial is ongoing as an open -label ex tension and 
overall, based on the preliminary data, the safety 
profile of 18 µg/day appears to be similar 
compared to 15 µg/day. During the open -label 
extension period the dose distribution across 
subjects has been approximately 6 -30 µg/day, 
titrated to ac hieve normocalcemia. The Trial dose section was

preliminary data shows no safety concern on

(doses below and above, respectively, the fixed

with no meaningful difference in adverse events

New text  
The 4 -week blinded treatment period of the Phase 
2 trial - with fixed dosing of TransCon PTH 15, 
18, and 21 µg/day - demonstrated that a dose of 
18 µg/day was both effective and well -tolerated, 
with less hypercalcemia compared to a dose of 21 
µg/day and without meaningful hypocalcemia. 
Preliminary data from the open label extension of 
the Phase 2 trial as of February 2021 
demonstrates comparable safety profiles at doses 
of both 15 and 18 µg/day. The dose distribution 
during the open label ex tension has been 6 -39 
µg/day, titrated to achieve normocalcemia. Phase 
2 data demonstrate s no meaningful difference in 
AEs, including those related to hypo - or 
hypercalcemia, on TransCon PTH doses 
<15µg/day or >21µg/day. 5 -10% of participants 
are anticipat ed to require doses >30µg/d to 
achieve normocalcemia in the present trial. 
Therefore, the starting dose for the Blinded 
Treatment Period will be 18 µg/day, followed by 
[CONTACT_13608] 6 -60 µg/day to achieve normocalcemia 
and independence from conventional the rapy.

Contraception  Due to the lack of genotoxic or teratogenic or 
reproductive toxicity with any component of 
TransCon PTH, acceptable effective contraception 
are methods that result in a failure rate of more than 
1% per year when used consistently and correctly 
are permitted in this trial.  Following the Clinical 
Trial Facilitation Group recommendations 
(CTFG  2014), such methods include:  Updated to align

Highly effective contraception are methods  that can 
achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when 
used consistently and correctly, following the CTFG 
2014 recommendations , such methods include :   
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen

− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence, defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period 
of risk associated with the study treatments  
• Postmenopausal.  A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause  
Methods of contraception with a failure rate of 
more than 1% per year with consisten t adherence 
are not permitted . Periodic absti nence (calendar, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational 
amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. Female condoms and 
male condoms should not be used together.

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Screeni ng Period (Week -6 to Week -2): 
The Screening Period consists of determining eligibility (including 
determining on a historical test within [ADDRESS_13072] during Screening that 24 -hour u Ca excretion is ≥125 mg/24 hr ), and 
optimizing vitamin D, calcium and magnesium levels, and doses of SoC 
(active vitamin D and calcium) prior to study drug (TransCon PTH or 
placebo) dosing to achieve the following target serum levels:  
• 25(OH) vitamin D: 20-80 ng/mL ( 49-200 nmol/L)  
• Magn esium : within  the normal range, or just below the normal range 
i.e.: ≥1.3 mg/dL (0.53 mmol/L)  
• Albumin -adjusted or ionized sCa: within the normal range, or just 
below the normal range, i.e.:

− Ionized sCa 4.4 0-5.29 mg/dL (or 1.10 -1.32 mmol/L)   
Therapeutic doses of calcitriol, alfacalcidol, calcium, magnesium and 
Vitamin D3 are adjusted only after initial Screening laboratory results 
are received. Follow -up laboratory assessments of the above values, wit h 
the exception of 25(OH) vitamin D levels, are performed approximately 
3 days after every dose adjustment  during the Screening Period ; the 
25(OH) vitamin D level may be rechecked ≥[ADDRESS_13073] is eligible to move to the Blinded 
Treatment Period and be randomized following confirmation by [CONTACT_13616]. Following  randomization, it is 
recommended to start the treatment period (Visit  1) within 2 weeks from 
the time of randomization.  
The Screening Period may be extended with Medical Monitor approval 
for subjects who fail to achieve values within  the target laboratory  
ranges within the Screening window.  
Blinded Treatment Period (Visit 1 - 10; Week 0 -26): 
Subjects will be randomized 3:1 to receive either TransCon PTH or 
placebo:  
• TransCon PTH 18 μg/day* , co-administered with SoC  
• Placebo for TransCon PTH (excipi[INVESTIGATOR_13556]) 18 μg/day , 
co-administered with SoC  
* Dose of TransCon PTH refers to dose of PTH(1 -34) administered  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_13611] 
(post -surgical vs other).  
All subjects will start with study drug 18 µg/day and will be individually 
and progressively titrated to an optimal dose in dose increments of 
3 μg/day.  
Blinded Treatment Period  Visit 1 -10 (Week s 0-26): 
Visit 1:  Start study drug 18 µg/day and decrease active vitamin D dose 
by 33 -50% ( e.g., skip 2nd dose of the day if taking BID, skip final dose 
of the day if taking three times daily ( TID), or reduce once daily dose of 
alfacalcidol ≥1.0 µg by 50% (≥0.5 µg) . 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13074] s will attend frequent clinic  visits and  laboratory  
visits  (LV)  (LV1, LV2 , LV3 ) to measure  sCa level s. Assuming albumin -
adjusted or ionized sCa remains ≥ the lower limit of normal (LLN) and ≤ 
the upper limit of normal (ULN), SoC doses  will be progressively 
withdrawn.  
Complete guidance on SoC titration during the Blinded Treatment 
Period is provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Appendix  2.  
Because this trial is assessing the potential for TransCon PTH to be a 
parathyroid hormone replacement therapy, a goal is for subjects to 
achieve independence from standing doses of calcitriol , alfacalcidol, and 
calcium supplements.  
Note: In case needed to meet recommended dietary intake of 
calcium, it is permitted to take calcium supplements ≤600 mg/day as 
a nutritional supplement for the sake of reaching the recommended 
dietary intake. The calcium dose of ≤ 600 mg/day is considered as 
“supplemental” to meeting recommended daily intake  for general 
health, as opposed to a “therapeutic” dose to treat 
hypoparathyroidism. The progressive cessation of calcitriol, 
alfacalcidol, and calcium should occur while increas ing the dose of 
TransCon PTH to achieve normocalcemia.  
Meanwhile, study drug doses can be increased by 3 µg/day as long as 
≥[ADDRESS_13075] elapsed since a prior dose adjustment in study drug. 
Gradual increases in study drug doses may facilitate gradual reduction 
and eventual cessation of SoC. Alternatively, study drug doses can be 
decreased by 3  µg/day for serum calcium levels that continue to be high 
even after all SoC has been wit hdrawn.  The study drug dose range for 
this trial  is 6-60 µg/day, and will be supported by 3 pen presentations 
delivering discrete doses of 6, 9, and 12  µg/day; 15, 18, and 21 µg/day; 
and 24, 27,  and 30 µg/day, respectively.   
Complete guidance on study drug titration during the Blinded Treatment 
Period  is provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Appendix  2.  
Per the Schedule of Events, initial clinic visits and LVs occur relatively 
frequently to accommodate dose titration of study drug , and occur less 
frequently later on (see Appendix  3 and Appendix  4).  
Open -Label Extension Period (Visits 10+; Weeks 26+) : 
At Visit 10  (Week 26) , all subjects will be assigned to open -label 
treatment as follows:  
• If still taking active vitamin D:  Start TransCon PTH at a dose of 
18 µg/day, and subsequently follow the titration algorithm as per  
Appendix  2 
• If NOT  taking active vitamin D :  
− And t aking study drug  ≥ 30 µg/day : Start TransCon PTH 
at a dose of 18  µg/day, and subsequently follow the 
titration algorithm  per Appendix  2 
− And taking study drug  dose < 30 µg/day : Start TransCon 
PTH at the same dose of study drug  taken at the end of the 
Blinded Treatment Period . Exception: In cases of an out-of-
range sCa level  at Visit 10, adjust the TransCon PTH 
and/or calcium doses as per  Appendix  2 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 37 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  TransCon PTH doses can be increased by 3 µg/day as long as ≥[ADDRESS_13076] elapsed - since a prior dose adjustment in study drug.  Gradual 
increases in study drug doses may facilitate gradual reduction and 
eventual cessation of SoC. Alternatively, study drug doses can be 
decreased by 3 µg/day for s Ca levels that continue to be high even after 
all SoC has been withdrawn.  Note: At all times during the trial, 
subjects with symptoms of hypocalcemia may take PRN  doses of 
calcium (preferred) and/or active vitamin D,  and/or do a n 
Unscheduled Laboratory Visit ( ULV ) to measure  sCa level s. Based 
on the sCa level,  the invest igator may titrate the SoC and/or  study 
drug  dose  per Appendix  2. Due to the long half -life of TransCon 
PTH, the full effect of a dose  level  occur s by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_13077]  Name: [CONTACT_13690] a solution with a

available. The three pen presentations are  6, 9, and 12 µg/day; 15, 18, 
and 21 µg/day; and 24, 27 and 30 µg/day, respectively. The TransCon 
PTH drug product concentration is 0.3  mg PTH(1 -34)/mL, so the

injector using 31G x5 mm pen needles to deliver doses of 6 -30 µg/day in 
a volume of ≤100 µL, to either abdomen or anterior thigh, rotating 
injection sites.  
The TransCon PTH allowed dose range will be 6 -60 µg/day. All doses 
>30 µg/day will be delivered in the form of two single doses injected 
one after another at different injection sites using two pens . 
All treatment groups may continue to take doses of  magnesium and 
vitamin D3 to maintain the defined ranges.  
BLINDING  This trial consists of a  26-week randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled treatment period followed by [CONTACT_3440] -label Extension Period 
of up to 156 weeks.  
To maintain the double -blind during the Blinded Treatment Period, the 
subjects will be randomized 3:1 to either receive initially 18  μg/day of 
TransCon PTH or placebo for TransCon PTH (excipi[INVESTIGATOR_13559]).

STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Details of applicable statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be finalized before trial unblinding and database lock of the Blinded Treatment Period. If discrepancies exist 
between the text of the statistical analysis as planned in the protocol and 
the final SAP, the final SAP will define the planned analysis of record. 
The Intent
-To-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all subjects who were 
randomized and received at least one dose of blinded study drug . All 
efficacy analysis will be based on ITT and treatment assignment per 
randomization. The Safety Analysis Population consists of all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. The 
safety analyses will be based on the Safe ty Analysis Population and 
actual treatment received.  
In general, data from clinical assessments will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. Categorical data will be presented using counts and percentages of subjects. Continuous variables will be presented using 
number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD)
/standard error (SE), 
median, minimum and maximum.  
All statistical tests will be two -sided and tested at the statistically 
significant level of 0.05. Confidence intervals will be 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise.  
The primary analysis will use the CMH ( Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel)  test 
stratified by [CONTACT_13611] (post -surgical vs other) to 
compare the proportion of subjects meeting the listed criteria of the 
primary endpoint (responders vs. non- responders) in the TransCon PTH 
vs. placebo groups.   Sequential testing will be applied to control the 
multiplicity for  the primary and key secondary endpoints. Details will be 
specified in the SAP.  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively in Extension 
Period analysis.  CCI

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  5. INTRODUCTION   
5.1. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE   
5.1.1.  Parathyroid Hormone   
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a product of endocrine secretion from the four parathyroid glands.  
It is synthesized by [CONTACT_13618] a prohormone peptide, eventually cleaved to 84 amino acids, 
i.e., PTH(1 -84), which is secreted.  Although PTH(1 -84) is the biologically  active form of PTH, 
receptor -mediated activities require only the 34 amino acid N -terminus fragment, PTH(1 -34).  
PTH(1 -84) is fairly quickly cleaved to PTH(1 -34) bo th by [CONTACT_13619]  (Hamilton  1983 ).  PTH(1 -33) appears to equipotent to PTH(1 -34) (Morley  1999 ). 
PTH maintains the body’s extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis, the former within a 
very narrow range.  When serum calcium ( sCa) levels drop, PTH is released from the 
parathyroid glands.  An important effect of PTH at the renal PTH/PTHrP receptor  is to increase 
calcium reabsorption, decrease phosphate reabsorption, and convert the prohormone 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) to the fully active steroid hormone, 1,25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 
[1,25D (OH) 2 vitamin D3 or calcitriol ].  Active vitamin D increases ca lcium and phosphate 
absorption in the small intestine.  Another direct action of PTH is to increase osteoclast activity 
causing calcium and phosphate to increase and potentially osteocyte activity,  increasing ionized 
calcium . 
5.1.2.  Hypoparathyroidism   
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) is a rare disease of impaired PTH production or activity.  The majority 
of cases (≥75%) are acquired, occurring secondary to anterior neck surgery in which 
approxima tely 0.12 -4.6% of procedures cause the parathyroid gland(s) to be inadvertently 
injured or destroyed (Brandi  2016 , Clarke  2016 ).  Of these, 3-30% result in chronic HP, i .e., 
features of HP lasting more than 6 months after the surgery  (Mannstadt  2013 , Brandi  2016 , 
Shoback  2016 ).  Autoimmune diseases are the second most common cause of acquired HP while 
less common causes include intrinsic genetic defects of the parathyroid glands, 
hemochromatosis, magnesium def iciency, as well as idiopathic disease (Brandi  2016 , 
Clarke  2016 ). 
The US prevalence rate of HP is estimated to range from 60,000 -115,000, thus meeting  orphan 
disease status  (Brandi  2016 ).  Given th e predominance of cases secondary to anterior neck 
surgery, HP incidence rates depend on the number of anterior neck surgeries performed in a 
given locale, the expertise of the surgeons, and underlying pathology.  
In HP, the sCa level drops and there is a l ack of compensatory PTH secretion , so 
calcium -phosphate homeostasis is disrupted.  The kidneys decrease calcium reabsorption, 
phosphate excretion, and conversion of 25 OHD to active 1,25 (OH) 2D.  Given decreased 
1,25(OH) 2D conversion in the kidneys, intestin al absorption of calcium and phosphate decline 
and due to deficient PTH the bone osteoclast activity is decreased, further decreasing sCa and 
resulting in over -mineralized bone and higher -than-normal bone mineral density ( BMD ).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_13562] 1,25 (OH) 2D 
production , patients with HP typi[INVESTIGATOR_13563] -normal levels of serum 
phosphate  (sP) due to decreased renal phosphate excretion . 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13095] of Care ( SoC) for HP – specifically active vitamin D and high doses of calcium 
– may improve hypocalcemia , particularly in patients with mild/moderate H P; active vitamin  D 
stimulates calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestines  and calcium supplements 
increase sCa  (Brandi  2016 ). Yet, chronic calcium and vitamin D therapy may also produce 
adverse effects beyond the original problems of HP because active vitamin D and calcium do not 
restore PTH -dependent renal calcium reabsorption, correct the elevated sP in HP, or correct 
diminished bone turnover  (Winer  2012 , Mannstadt  2017 ).  Patients on S oC may become 
hypercalciuric, with a subsequent risk for nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic kidney 
disease (Winer  2012 , Mannstadt  2017 ). Decreased PTH activity also leads to decreased bone 
resorption, i.e., a low bone turnover – high bone mass state.   Finally, as S oC increases both sCa 
(which is low in HP) and sP (which is elevated in HP), S oC can also result in an increased 
calcium -phosphate product  (CxP) , thereby [CONTACT_13620], including 
in the vascular system, the r enal parenchyma, the lens of the eye, and the basal ganglia of the 
central nervous system  (Abate  2017 ).  
Based on the current S oC, there have been six goals of chronic HP therapy: 1) prevent signs a nd 
symptoms of hypocalcemia; 2) maintain sCa concentration slightly below or within the 
low-normal range; 3) maintain the CxP below 55 mg2/dL2 (4.4 mmol2/L2); 4) avoid 
hypercalciuria;  5) avoid hypercalcemia; and 6) avoid renal (nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis) 
and other extra -skeletal calcifications (Bilezikian  2016 , Bran di 2016 ). 
In the absence of a true PTH replacement therapy that replaces active PTH within the normal 
physiologic range 24 hours per day, achieving all six goals of HP therapy is a challenge.  
Furthermore, given that active vitamin D and calcium may cause paradoxical long -term 
morbidity and mortality, replacing the missing hormone in HP patients has long been desired.  In 
1996, Winer et al established the experimental basis for using biologically active PTH(1 -34) to 
treat HP  (Winer  1996 ).  Since then, twice daily (BID) administration has been shown to achieve 
better calcemic control than daily, and continuous infusion has been shown to achieve better 
control than BID (Winer  1998 , Winer  2008 , Winer  2012 ).  In addition to normalizing both sCa,  
sP, and serum magnesium (sMg), PTH by [CONTACT_13621], a reduction in urine calcium (uCa), and normalized bone turnover compared to BID 
PTH(1 -34) administration , despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 65% lower dose of infused vs BID PTH(1 -34) 
(Winer  2012 ). While intermittent PTH administration results in high hormone fluctuations, with 
an initial supraphysiological PTH level [high maximum concentration ( Cmax)] followed by a 
rapid decline to  subtherapeutic levels, continuous infusion maintains PTH level s in the 
physiological range throughout the day.  Although PTH(1 -34) is currently only approved for 
osteoporosis, these studies provided proof of concept for its use in HP.  Thus, with a treatm ent 
that provides active PTH within the lower half of the normal range for 24 hours per day, it 
should be possible to change the 2 nd goal to maintaining a sCa concentration within the normal 
range, while achieving the remaining 5 goals.  
Recombinant PTH(1 -84) (Natpara , trademark owned by [CONTACT_11750] ) was approved as an adjunct to 
active vitamin D and calcium by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in 2015 
(BLA  #125511  2015 ) using PTH to treat HP. In its Advisory Meeting Briefing Document, the 
FDA noted that “This [lack of control of urinary calcium excretion] is primarily due to the short 
half-life (~ 3 hours) of Natpara, which results in PTH concentrations returning to baseline by 
[CONTACT_13622]-304, Version  7.0  Page 54 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  10-12 hours”, and also noted that Natpara did not reduce the clinical epi[INVESTIGATOR_13564] S oC (Briefing  Document  2014 , 
Khurana  2019 ).  Using a calcium homeostasis systems pharmacology model, the FDA simulated 
effects following [ADDRESS_13096] a 
theoretical slow -release model.  It concluded that PTH replaceme nt therapy requires a 
physiologic profile, specifically a dosing regimen that is either more frequent than daily dosing 
or daily dosing with a slow -release formulation that achieves an infusion -like exposure within 
the physiological normal range; both of w hich the model predicted would decrease renal calcium 
excretion ( Khurana  2019 ).  In April 2017, once -daily subcutaneous (SC) injection administration 
of recombinant PTH(1 -84) (Natpar) was approved in Europe as a new therapy and recommended 
for adult patients with HP who cannot be well controlled on conventional therapy alone 
(CHMP  2017 ).  However, CHMP noted that thi s treatment has not demonstrated the ability to 
reduce the incidence of hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, or hypercalciuria relative to the 
conventional therapy of oral calcium and active vitamin D analogues, due to its relatively short 
half-life of 3 hours (CHMP  2017 ).  On 9/5/2019, FDA removed Natpara from the US market 
due to safety concerns about rubber particles from the vial sep tum; it remains not commercially 
available in the US . 
TransCon PTH  is a prodrug consisting of PTH(1 -34) transiently conjugated to a branched 
40 kDa methoxypolyethylene glycol ( mPEG ) moiety  through  a proprietary TransCon Linker as 
illustrated in Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Structure of TransCon PTH   
 
 
TransCon PTH is administered as a once -daily SC and is designed to  maintain a steady 
concentration of PTH in the blood stream within the normal physiological range  for [ADDRESS_13097]-order kinetics, whereby [CONTACT_13623](1 -34) or PTH(1 -33) (major 
metabolite) from the TransCon Linker at a rate proportional to the prodrug concentration. The 
carrier inactivates PTH and shields it from clearance  and receptor binding and uptake .  
Following release from the prodrug , active PTH  retains the original mode of action ( i.e., binding 
to the PTH receptor 1) and the TransCon Linker -mPEG is cleared primarily by [CONTACT_13624]  
(see Figure  2).

5.2. RELEVANT FINDINGS FR OM NONCLINICAL STUDI ES  
Please refer to the current version of the TransCon PTH Investigator’s Brochure 
Section  4 – Nonclinical Studies  for a full summary o f the nonclinical data.   
A comprehensive nonclinical development program has been conducted for TransCon PTH to 
support clinical development.  The testing strategy involved a range of in silico, in vitro and in 
vivo studies in Sprague Dawley  rats, cynomolgus monkeys, and New Zealand White rabbits to 
characterize the pharmacokinetics ( PK), TK, PD, and safety profile of TransCon PTH.  
Bioanalytical assays, including immunogenicity assays were developed and validated according 
to relevant guidel ines. 
In vivo safety assessment was based on standard toxicological endpoints and assessment of bone 
turnover markers, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), dual-energy X -ray 
absorptiometry ( DXA ), and histomorphometry.  
The pharmacological eff ect of TransCon PTH was demonstrated in single -dose PK/PD and in 
repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats, monkeys, and rabbits.  The pharmacological effect was 
further confirmed in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTx) rats, a disease model for HP.  
In repeat -dose toxicity studies the no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) for SC daily 
administrations of TransCon PTH for up to 26 weeks was 10  μg PTH(1 -34)/kg in rats and 0.5  μg 
PTH(1 -34)/kg in monkeys.  The adverse findings considered related to TransCon PTH were all 
considered exaggerated pharmacological effects of continuous administration of PTH resulting in 
sustained hypercalcemia.  TransCon PTH did not induce any adverse effects on the central 
nervou s, pulmonary, or cardiovascular system, and was not considered genotoxic as assessed in 
specific genotoxicity studies.   Furthermore, the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies 
conducted so far have not identified any adverse effects on embryofetal  development or fertility.  
5.3. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE   
A Phase 1 clinical trial [a randomized, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and 
multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics  
(PD) , and PK of TransCon PTH in healthy adult subjects] conducted under good clinical practice 
(GCP ), ethics committee ( EC), and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines has been completed.  

Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 56 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  A total of 132 male and female normal healthy subjects were randomized and received study 
treatment; 69 subjects in 7 SAD cohorts [56 received TransCon PTH and 13 placebo (3.5, 12, 32, 
48, 72, 100, and 124 μg/day PTH)] with a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 124 μg PTH and 
63 subjects in 6 MAD cohorts [50 received TransCon PTH and 13 placebo (3.5, 7.0, 12, 16, 20, 
and 24  μg/day PTH)] with a MTD of 20 μg PTH/day.  
The primary goal of the trial was to identify the clinically effective dose range for the 
Phase  2 clinical trial (bas ed on change in albumin -adjusted sCa from baseline), the effect of 
treatment on the fractional excretion of calcium (FECa), and to assess the PK profile, safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of TransCon PTH.  
In healthy volunteers in SAD cohorts, TransC on PTH demonstrated dose -dependent increases in 
Free PTH, corresponding to the sum of active Free PTH [intact Free PTH(1 -34)] and the main 
metabolite Free PTH(1 -33) in the calculated normal range, which correlated with dose -dependent 
increases in albumin -adjusted s Ca and suppression of intact PTH(1 -84) at all single doses of 
≥32 μg.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] m ild hypercalcemia over 3 days in the cohorts receiving single doses of 
TransCon ≥[ADDRESS_13098] s Ca (mean ±SD of 10.3±0.23 to  
10.97±0.56  mg/dL on Day 2),  the urine FECa remained well -controlled below the upper level of 
normal ( ULN ) of the normal range (2%), demonstrating that active PTH within the normal range 
continuously over 24 hours can enhance the renal handling of calcium.   
Figure  3 shows a dose -dependent increase in Free PTH , with a low peak -to-trough ratio of 
~1.27 to 1.55 over 24 hours.  Phase 1 data demonstrate that the effective half -life of Free PTH 
released from the prodrug is ~60 hours, with Free PTH approaching  steady -state by [CONTACT_2006] 8  after 
dosing . This is further supported by  [CONTACT_13625] 2 trial  
(TransCon PTH TCP -201). The normal physiologic range for intact PTH(1 -84) is 10 -65 pg/mL; 
as PTH(1 -34) and PTH(1 -33) comprise about 40% of the molecular mass of the intact hormone, 
the calculated normal range is about 4 -26 pg/mL.

11.2 mg/dL) on Day 11, the urine FECa remained well -controlled below the ULN of the normal 
range (2%), demonstrating that active PTH within the normal range continuously over 24 hours 
can enhance the renal handling of calcium.

TransCon PTH was generally well tolerated across the clinical dose range proposed for  the 
Phase  2 clinical trial.   There were no drug -related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe 
adverse events.  
In summary, TransCon PTH demonstrated a potent serum calcemic and renal calcium 
reabsorption effect in normal subjects, predicting control of b oth s Ca and uCa in patients with 
HP.  The effect of TransCon PTH on bone formation markers was consistent with results 
reported for continuous infusion of PTH(1 -34) (Horwitz  2011 , Winer  2012 , Winer  2014 ) and 
lacked an anabolic effect.  
A Phase 2 clinical trial [a randomized, placebo -controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
PD, and PK of TransCon PTH ] in patients with HP  conducted under GCP, EC, and Declaration 
of Helsinki guidelines is currently ongoing . 
A total of [ADDRESS_13099] 26 weeks  duration treated with a stable 
dose of ≥ 0.25 µg BID active vitamin D ( or ≥ 1.0 µg/day of alfacalcidol ) and ≥[ADDRESS_13100] 12 weeks prior to Screening were randomized 1:1:1:1 to TransCon PTH 15,

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  18 or 21 µg/day or to placebo  for 4 weeks, followed by [CONTACT_13626] -label extension for an 
additional 12 months.  Preliminary data up to 26 weeks of follow up are presently available.  
In the per protocol analysis (n=57) a t four weeks, 22/44 subjects (50%) in the TransCon PTH  
group met the primary endpoint vs. 2/13 subjects (15%) in the placebo gro up with  a statistically 
significant response (p =0.0308).  82% of subjects in the TransCon PTH group were able to come 
off SoC  (i.e., off active vitamin D and ≤ 500 mg /day of calcium supplements)  vs 15% of subjects 
in the placebo group (p<0.0001), and 50% of the TransCon PTH group were able to completely 
stop active vitamin D and all calcium supplements vs . 0% in the placebo group ( p=0.0008).  The 
results demonstrated that TransCon PTH increased s Ca levels  (see Figure  5), enabled 
discontinuation of active vitamin D and continuous reduction of calcium supplements over the 
four-week period.  TransCon PTH reduced urinary calcium excretion (as measured by [CONTACT_13627] ) 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_13566] s P and CxP  (see Figure  6).

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Figure  6: Serum Phosphate: Change from Baseline Value by [CONTACT_13629] 4 -week Blinded Treatment Period, and no serious or 
severe adverse events were shown at any point.  No treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) 
led to discontinuation  of study drug  or early discontinuation of the trial , and the overall incidence 
of TEAEs was comparable between TransCon PTH and placebo.  
Intensive PK assessments (including Free PTH) were analyzed in the Phase 1 trial (TransCon 
CT-103), showing that the d ose range of 12 -24 µg/day resulted in Free PTH levels within the 
lower half of the normal range.  Confirmatory PK (including Free PTH in a subset of subjects) 
was analyzed in the Phase 2 trial (TransCon PTH TCP -201), and again showed that dosing over 
4 wee ks at doses of 15 -21 µg/day resulted in Free PTH levels within the lower half of the normal 
range.     
Thus, the double -blind portion of the Phase 2 trial (TransCon PTH TCP -201) in patients with HP 
confirms the results of the Phase  1 trial in normal human volunteers, as well as the results of the 
National Institutes of Health ( NIH) PTH -infusion studies ( Winer  2012 , Winer  2014 ); namely, 
that TransCon PTH by [CONTACT_13630] 
24/7 effectively treats all of the acute symptoms and signs of HP more effectively than SoC.  
Analysis of data from the Phase 2 open label extension confirm these findin gs, with 91% of 
participants requiring  no vitamin D and  ≤500 mg/d elemental calcium.  Participants required 
TransCon PTH doses between 6 and 3 9 µg/day.  No TEAEs related to abnormal serum calcium 
have required urgent medical attention.  No TEAEs have resul ted in discontinuation of study 
drug, withdrawal from the trial or death.  There have been no suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction s (S[LOCATION_003]Rs ) as of February [ADDRESS_13101] aw 
consent from the Phase 2 trial in open label Extension Period  due to the requirements for 
contraception.

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  5.4. TRIAL RATIONALE   
A NIH trial with once -daily SC administration of PTH (1-34) maintained the mean s Ca level 
within the n ormal range over a 24 -hour period  and reduced u Ca excretion (Winer  1996 ).  
Another trial in adults demonstrated that twice -daily PTH (1–34), at a significantly lower daily 
dose, provides improved metabolic control compared with once -daily  PTH (1–34) therapy 
(Winer  1998 ).  Long term effect of PTH(1 –34) was further studied in patients with HP of various 
etiologies.  The trial demonstrate d that long-term BID PTH administration maintain ed mean s Ca 
within or just below the normal range over a  3-year period with concurrent normalization of 
mean urinary calcium excretion  (Winer  2003 ).  Further  on, a trial comparing contin uous 
PTH(1 -34) delivery, by [CONTACT_13631], with BID SC injection in adult HP patients showed that 
continuous exposure to PTH restored bone turnover to normal levels while avoiding the anabolic 
overstimulation from daily or twice -daily injection  (Winer  2012 ).  In addition, pump delivery led 
to a 65% reduction in the PTH(1 -34) dose needed to maintain normal sCa levels in the HP 
patients.  The trial also hypothesized tha t pump delivery of PTH (1-34) would provide more 
physiological control of s Ca and u Ca (compared with conventional treatment or intermittent PTH 
delivery), w ould reduce symptoms of  HP, improve quality of life  (QOL) , and lower the long -
term risk of renal dama ge, without adverse effect on  bone  (Winer  2012 ). 
Recombinant PTH(1 -84) (Natpara) was approved as an adjunct to active vitamin D and calcium 
by [CONTACT_13632] 2015  to treat HP.  But in the Advisory Committee Natpara Briefing Document, 
the FDA also concluded that due to its  short half-life (~ 3 hours), PTH concentrations returns to 
baseline by 10 -12 hours and there is a lack of control of urinary calcium excretion.  In addition, 
Natpara d id not reduce the clinical epi[INVESTIGATOR_13567] S oC (Briefing  Document  2014 ).  FDA recently published these data 
(Khurana  2019 ). Similar comments were made by [CONTACT_13633] (CHMP  2017 ). 
5.5. SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL  RISKS AND BENEFITS   
5.5.1.  Potential Risks   
In comparison to short -lived PTH molecules that show supraphysiological PTH levels at tmax 
followed by a rapid decline to undetectable levels after 10 -12 hours, TransCon PTH is designed 
for sustained -release of PTH with a t½ of ~ 60 hours, ensuring a stable systemic concentration of 
the hormone with a flat, infusion -like profile within the phys iological normal concentration 
range.  The ability of TransCon PTH to maintain circulating PTH levels in the normal range has 
been confirmed in a Phase 1 clinical trial (TransCon PTH CT -103) and in the Phase  2 trial 
(TransCon PTH  TCP-201), as well as a lac k of an anabolic effect seen with short -lived PTH 
molecules.   
The following risks have been seen in either the TransCon PTH Phase [ADDRESS_13102] 
been reported for approved PTH medications, and thus considered to be potential risks for 
TransCon P TH: 
• Hypercalcemia  
• Injection site erythema  
• Orthostatic hypotension/presyncope/syncope/dizziness/tachycardia (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814])  
• Headache  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 61 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • Fatigue  
• Nausea  
Osteosarcoma is listed as a potential risk with short -acting PTH analogs, but is not considered to 
be a risk w ith TransCon PTH, due to the absence of an anabolic effect based on no increase in 
procollagen type 1 amino -terminal propeptide ( P1NP ) over 4 weeks in the Phase 2 trial.  
Please refer to the current version of the TransCon PTH Investigator’s Brochure  
Secti on 6.4 – Anticipated Risks for further details .  
During the Blinded Treatment Period, there is a potentially increased risk of hypocalcemia i f the 
starting dose of 18 µg/day is sub -optimal, or hypercalcemia if the starting dose of 18 µg/day is 
higher than optimal  for a subject.  However, this risk is limited to no more than about 6 days (in 
the event of hypercalcemia) and about 9 days (in the event of hypocalcemia) , when the dose can 
be held or  adjusted up or down, and is also reduced due to the laboratory visits (LVs) over the 
time between visits.  Additionally, acute hypocalcemia  can be managed in most situations by 
[CONTACT_13634] D and calcium, and acute hypercalcemia can be managed by 
[CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_13568].  
During the reduction in S oC following initiation of study drug (TransCon PTH or placebo) at 
Visit 1 ( and for those subjects on active vitamin D at Visit 10), there is a higher risk of 
hypocalcemia.  However, the following have been included in the protocol to limit the extent of 
this risk:  
• Step-wise decreases of S oC occurring only after sCa levels are confirmed to be within 
appropriate pre -defined ranges  and the subject is asymptomatic   
• Returning subjects with symptomatic hypocalcemia to their previous S oC dose  
• Allowing subjects who experience hypocalcemic symptoms during this period (and 
throughout the trial) to use PRN  doses of S oC, and to increase their dose of TransCon PTH 
≥7 days 
5.5.2.  Potential Benefits   
In the Phase 2 trial, TransCon PTH at doses of 15 -21 µg/day allowed subjects with HP to safely 
discontinue their SoC without experiencing meaningful hypo - or hypercalcemic symptoms, 
mostly after [ADDRESS_13103] of dail y TransCon PTH on sCa levels, and

6.3. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIV ES  
7. TRIAL DESIGN   
7.1. TRIAL DESIGN DISCUSSION   
The trial design is a randomized, parallel -group, double -blind, placebo -controlled design. 
Randomization introduces a deliberate element of chance into the assignment of treatme nt in a 
clinical trial. During subsequent analysis of the trial data, it provides a sound statistically basi s 
for the quantitative evaluation of the evidence relating to treatment effect.  
A double -blind set -up has been chosen to minimize the potential bia ses resulting from 
differences in management, treatment, or assignment of subject or interpretation of results that 
could arise as a result of subjects or invest igator knowledge of the assigned treatment.  
A placebo group will be used as a control -group. It  is considered ethically justifiable since the 
subjects in both treatment groups can continue taking SoC and PRN  medication to treat their 
hypocalcemic symptoms. Furthermore, subject s will be medically monitored during the trial and 
the expenses  related  to SoC may be reimbursed , always following national legislation and/or 
guidance . CCI

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  7.2. OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN  AND PLAN   
The double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group treatment period  of this trial is expected to 
enroll approximately 76 subjects from up to approximately 40 sites worldwide.  
Subjects will be  randomized in a 3:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups:  
• TransCon PTH 18 μg/day* , co-administered with SoC  
• Placebo for TransCon PTH (excipi[INVESTIGATOR_13559])  18 μg/day , co-administered with SoC  
* Dose of TransCon PTH refers to dose of PTH(1 -34) administered  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_13611] (post-surgical vs other ).  
All subjects will start with study drug 18 µg/day of and will be individually and progressively 
titrated to an optimal dose in dose increments of 3 μg/day.  
Study drug , calcium and active vitamin D will be titrated  according to the Titration Algorithm 
(Appendix 2)  on each occasion serum calcium is measured.     
Dose range for the trial will be supported by  3 pen presentations delivering discrete doses of 6, 9, 
and 12 µg/day; 15, 18, and 21 µg/day; and 24, 27  and 30 µg/day, respectively.  The TransCon 
PTH allowed dose  range will be 6 -60 µg/day. 
Following successful completion of the Blinded Treatment Period, subjects will be allowed to 
enter the open -label Extension Period when all subjects will receive TransCon PTH.  
Because the potential for TransCon  PTH to be a hormone replacement therapy is being assessed 
in this trial, a goal is for subjects to achieve independence from standing doses of calcitriol and 
alfacalcidol, and to progressively reduce calcium supplements to ≤600 mg/day (a dose 
considered a s “supplemental” to meeting recommended daily intake for genera l health, as 
opposed to a “therapeutic” dose to treat HP).  The progressive cessation of calcitriol, 
alfacalcidol, and calcium should occur while increasing the dose of TransCon  PTH to achieve 
normocalcemia.  
Per the Schedule of Events, initial study visits and LVs occur relatively frequently to 
accommodate dose titration of TransCon PTH, and occur less frequently later on ( see 
Appendix  3 and Appendix  4). 
The trial consists of:  
• Screening Period (supplement optimization):  Up to approximately 4 weeks (plus a 
recommended period of up to approximately  2 weeks between randomization and V isit 1) 
• Blinded Treatment Period (study drug and SoC optimization):  26 weeks  
• Extension Period (open -label TransCon PTH treatment):  [ADDRESS_13105] up to  approximately  
190 weeks  (including follow up telephone contact [ADDRESS_13106] study drug administra tion).

7.2.1.  Measures Taken to Maximize Study Integrity and Minimize Bias   
Subject visits should be performe d at approximately the same time of day , and preferably in the 
morning hours .  Also, assessments should be performed in a similar fashion at each visit.  
Additionally, all efforts will be made to keep missing data to a minimum, including the 
following:  
• Investigators will be trained about the importance of subject retention  
• Investigators will be instructed to encourage subjects to complete all trial visits, including 
any subjects who discontinue the study drug early  
• The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will inclu de a statement educating subjects about the 
scientific importance of their data even if the subject discontinues study drug early  
• Special efforts will be made to provide assistance to subjects/families who might discontinue 
due to travel or cost barriers, such as offers of free transportation to the clinic  
• All trial visits  have visit windows to allow flexibility for clinic attendance (see  Schedule of 
Events , Appendix  3) 
• Every effort w ill be made to contact [CONTACT_13636]   
• To minimize individual investigator bias, Appendix  2 provide standardized guidelines for 
withdrawal /adjustment  of SoC and titration of TransCon PTH based on objective laboratory 
tests and subjects’ experience of hypo - or hypercalcemic symptoms.  Additionally, the 
Medical Monitor will perform timely review of albumin -adjusted s Ca and/or ionized s Ca 
results and prescribed dosing to confirm investigator compliance with  Appendix  2  
* Plus a maximum of 2 weeks between randomization and VI  
** Target Week for visits between v 16 and V26: See Appendix  [ADDRESS_13107] 26 weeks; treated with either calcitriol ≥0.5 μg /day or alfacalcidol 
≥1.0 μg /day and elemental calcium ≥800 mg /day for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening; and 
have a 24-hour uCa excretion ≥125 mg/24 hr , may enter the Screening Period.  
Note: The thresholds for calcitriol, alfacalcidol, and calcium are provided above in total 
daily doses. Acknowledging that the total daily doses may be taken in divided doses 
throughout the day, the corresponding thresholds  would be calcitriol ≥0.25 μg BID; 
alfacalcidol ≥0.50 μg BID; calcium ≥400  mg BID . 
8.1. TRIAL ENTRY CRITERIA   
8.1.1.  Inclusion Criteria   
1. Males and females, ≥[ADDRESS_13108]  
26 weeks . Diagnosis of HP is established based on a histor y of hypocalcemia  in the setting of 
inappropriately low serum PTH levels  (Hypocalcemia is defined as a value below the 
reference range for normal at the performing laboratory.  Inappropriately low serum PTH 
levels are defined as at or below the median value of the reference range for normal at the 
performing laboratory while the concomitant serum calcium is low.  If specific lab results at 
the time of original diagnosis are not available, as historical diagnosis affirming these two 
components is adequate for inclusion ) 
3. Requirement  for doses o f SoC (e.g., calcitriol, alfacalcidol, calcium supplements) at or above 
a minimum threshold:  
• For countries other than Japan : requirement  for a dose of  calcitriol ≥0.5 μg /day, or 
alfacalcidol ≥1.0 μg /day and (elemental) calcium ≥ 800 mg /day (e.g., calcium c itrate, 
calcium carbonate etc.)  for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening *. In addition, the dose of 
calcitriol, or alfacalcidol, or calcium should be stable  for at least 5 weeks prior to 
Screening  
• For Japan : requirement for a dose of calcitriol  ≥1.0 µg /day, or alfacalcidol ≥2.0 µg/day 
for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening *.  In addition, the dose of calcitriol or alfacalcidol 
should be stable* * for at least 5 weeks prior to Screening.  In Japan only (due to local 
practice and dietary patterns), there  is no requirement to exceed a minimum dose of 
calcium supplements    
* Excluding individuals receiving PTH -like drugs within 12 weeks of the screening visit, who 
need only demonstrate a stable requirement for elemental calcium and active vitamin D above 
minimum thresholds for 5 weeks prior to the screening visit.

The TransCon PTH delivery system consists of a multi -use cartridge integrated into a modified  
Ypsomed UnoPen Fix pen injector using 31G x5 mm pen needles.  The cartridge contains  
compounded solution  of TransCon PTH or placebo for TransCon PTH with a fill volume 
sufficient for 14 doses.   Each study drug administration is in a volume ≤100 μL (6 µg/day in  
volumes of 20 µL, 9 µg/day in volumes of 30 µL, 12 µg/day in volumes of 40 µL, 15 µg/day in 
volumes of 50  µL, 1 8 µg/day in volumes of 60 µL, 21 µg/day in volumes of 70 µL, 24 µg/day in 
volumes of 80 µL, 27 µg/day in volumes of 90 µL, or 30 µg/day in volumes of 100 µL), and is to 
be self -administered (following  training by [CONTACT_464]).  There is a total of  4 possible injection 
areas: right abdomen, left abdomen, right anterior thigh, and left anterior  thigh , and multiple 
sub-areas within each area .  Subjects should be instructed to rotate injection sites. Refer to the 
IFU for complete  instructions on administration.  
Although the starting dose is 1 8 µg PTH or placebo (using the mid -dose pen), throughout the 
entire trial  (including Blinded and Open Label Treatment Period) , all three pen presentations are 
available for TransCon PTH or corresponding placebo allowing for dose increments of 3 µg (6, 
9, and 12 µg; 15, 18, and 21 µg; and 24, 27 and 30 µg, respectively).  
The study drug  allowed dose range will be 6 -60 µg/day. All doses >30 µg/day will be delivered 
in the form of two single doses injected one after another at different injection sites using two 
pens of the same pen presentation, except for the 45 µg/day dose which will be delivered as a 
combination of the mid -dose and high -dose pen presentations as shown in Table  1. Based on the 
design verification data for the pen presentations  (at standard atmosphere conditio ns), dose 
accuracy data for a given combination of doses from two pens ha s been  evaluated against the 
acceptance criteria for dose accuracy. The combinations presented in Table  1 will deliver the 
desired doses within the specifications for dose accuracy. Two injections will be given shortly 
after each other and the dose can therefore be considered the sum of the two injections.

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  9.3. SELECTION OF TRIAL D OSES   
The 4-week Blinded Treatment  Period of the Phase  2 tria l - with fixed do sing of TransCon PTH 
15, 18, and 21  µg/day -  demonstrated that a dose of 18 µg/day was both effective and well -
tolerated, with less hypercalcemia compared to a dose of 21 µg/day and without meaningful 
hypocalcemia.  Preliminary data  from the open label extension of the Phase 2 trial as of February 
2021 demonstrates comparable safety profile s at doses of both 15 and  18 µg/day. The dose 
distribution during the open label extension  has been 6 -39 µg/day, titrated to achieve 
normocalcemia. Phase 2 data demonstrate s no meaningful difference in AEs, including those 
related to hypo - or hypercalcemia , on TransCon PTH doses <15  µg/day or >21  µg/day. 5-10% of 
participants are anticipated to require doses > 30 µg/d to achieve normocalcemia  in the present 
trial. Therefore , the starting dose for the Blinded Treatment Period  will be 1 8 µg/day, followed 
by [CONTACT_13640] 6-60 µg/day to achieve normocal cemia and independence from conventional 
therapy .   
9.4. TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT   
9.4.1.  Treatment Assignment During Blinded Treatment  Period   
Subjects will be randomized 3:1 into TransCon PTH or placebo . 
• TransCon PTH 18 µg/day , co-administered with SoC  
• Placebo for TransCon PTH , co-administered with SoC   
− Mimicking dose  of 18 µg/day  
All subjects will start with study drug 18 µg/day and will be individually and progressively 
titrated to an optimal dose in dose increments of 3 μg/day.  
9.4.2.  Treatment Assignment During Open -Label Extension  Period   
At Visit 10 (Week 26) , subjects will be assigned to open -label treatment as follows:  
• If still taking active vitamin D:  Start TransCon PTH at a dose of 1 8 µg/day, and 
subsequently follow the titration algorithm as per  Appendix  2  
• If NOT  taking active vitamin D :  
− And taking study drug  ≥30 µg/day : Start TransCon PTH a t a dose of 1 8 µg/day, 
and subsequently follow the titration algorithm  per Appendix  2 
− And taking study drug  <30 µg/day : Start  TransCon PTH at the same dose of study 
drug taken at the end of  the Blinded Treatment Period . Exception: in cases of an out-
of-range sCa level  at Visit 10, adjust the TransCon PTH  and/or calcium  doses as per 
Appendix  2 
9.5. DOSE ADJUSTMENTS   
9.5.1.  Screening Period Supplement Dose Adjustments   
During the Screening Period, adjustments to doses of HP -related supplements [SoC (active 
vitamin D  – calcitriol, alfacalcidol – and calcium) , magnesium, vitamin D ] will be made to 
achieve the following laboratory levels:  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 73 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • 25(OH) vitamin D: 20-80 ng/mL  (49-200 nmol/L ) 
• Magnesium  within the normal range  or just below the normal range i.e.: ≥1.3 mg/dL 
(0.53  mmol/L)  
• Albumin -adjusted or ionized sCa: within the normal range , or just below the normal range, 
i.e.: 
− Albumin -adjusted sCa 7.8 -10.6 mg/dL (or 1.95 -2.64 mmol/L)  
− Ionized sCa 4.4 0-5.29 mg/dL (or 1.10 -1.32 mmol/L)   
Therapeutic doses of calcitriol, alfacalcidol, calcium , magnesium and vitamin D3  are adjusted 
only after in itial Screening laboratory results are received.  Follow -up laboratory assessment s of 
the above values, with exception of 25(OH) vitamin D level s, are performed approximately 
3 days after every dose adjustment during the Screening Period.  25(OH) v itamin D level may be 
rechecked ≥7 days from any dose change.  If required, additional dose adjustments, with 
follow -up laboratory assessments approximately 3  days later, may be performed  throughout the 
Screening Period .  
9.5.2.  Blinded Treatment  Period (Visits 1 -10; Weeks 0 -26) Dose Adjustments   
[IP_ADDRESS].  SoC Dose Adjustments during Blinded Treatment Period   
Visit 1:  Start study drug 18 µg/day and decrease active vitamin D dose by 33 -50% ( e.g., skip 
2nd dose of the day if taking BID, skip final dose of the day if taking three times daily (TID), or 
reduce once daily dose of alfacalcidol ≥1.0 µg by 50% (≥0.5 µg) . 
Subsequ ently, a ctive vitamin D and/or calcium doses should  be titrat ed as per  Appendix  2. The 
target vitamin D range during treatment phases of this trial is  30-80 ng/mL  
SoC adjustments should be made preferably  within 48 hours of blood collection.   
Because this trial is assessing the potential for TransCon PTH to be a parathyroid hormone 
replacement therapy, a goal is for subjects to achieve independence from standing doses of 
calcitriol , alfacalcidol, and calcium supplements.  
Note: In case needed to meet recommended dietary intake of calcium, it is permitted to 
take calcium supplements ≤600 mg/day as a nutritional supplement for the sake of reaching 
the recommended dietary intake. The calcium dose of ≤600 mg/day is considered as 
“supplemental” to meeting recommended daily intake for general health, as opposed to a 
“therapeutic” dose to treat hypoparathyroidism. The progressive cessation of calcitriol, 
alfacalcidol, and calcium should occur while increasing the dose of TransCon PTH to 
achieve normocalcemia.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Drug Dose Adjustments During Blinded Treatment Period   
All subjects w ill start with 18 µg/day of study drug . The study drug  dose will be individually and 
progressively titrated in dose increments of 3μg /day with the goal to achieve normocalcemia as 
shown in  Appendix  2.

withdrawn.   
Serum calcium results from local laboratory analysis will be used to guide titration of study drug.  
Central laboratory results will be definitive  for data analysis.  
9.5.3.  Extension  Period (Visits 10+; Weeks 26+) Dose Adjustments   
[IP_ADDRESS].  SoC Dose Adjustments during Extension Period   
At Visit 10 (Week 26), the following categories of subjects will start TransCon PTH 18 µg/day.  
• Those still taking active vitamin D (this group may be enriched with subjects initially 
randomized to placebo)  
• Those off  active vitamin D  and taking study drug  ≥30 µg/day  
As such, when selecting the appropriate doses of SoC (active vitamin D and calcium 
supplements)  to accompany the TransCon PTH 18 µg/day , investigators are advised to : 
• Consider  the doses of active vitamin D and calcium requ ired at trial baseline (before 
exposure to the study drug)  
AND  
• Reduce the active vitamin D ( taken before exposure to study drug ) by 33 -50% when starting 
TransCon PTH 18 µg/day at Visit 10  
Start the new SoC regimen:  
• On the day of Visit 10 for those subjects who are still taking active vitamin D at the time of 
Visit 10  
• On the day after  Visit 10 for those subjects who are off active vitamin D and taking study 
drug ≥30 µg/day at Visit 10  
[IP_ADDRESS].  TransCon PTH  Dose Adjustments during Extension  Period   
For subjects still taking active vitamin D at Visit 1 0: Start  TransCon PTH at a dose of 18 µg/day  
at Visit 10, and subsequently follow the titration algorithm  as per Appendix  2. 
For subjects not taking active vitamin D at Visit 10 and taking study drug  dose ≥  30 µg/day : 
Start TransCon PTH at a dose of 1 8 µg/day  at Visit 10 , and subsequently follow the titration 
algorithm  per Appendix  2. 
For su bjects  not taking active vitamin D at Visit 10 and taking study dru g dose < 30 µg/day : 
Start TransCon PTH at Visit 10 at the same dose of study drug  taken at the end of the Blinded 
Treatment period. Exception : in cases of an out-of-range sCa level at Visit [ADDRESS_13118] the 
TransCon PTH and/or calcium doses as per  Appendix  2.  
The TransCon PTH dose selection at Visit 10  is also demonstrated in the decision tree below in 
Figure  8. 
TransCon PTH doses can be increased by 3  µg/day as long as ≥[ADDRESS_13119] elapsed since a prior

• Evidence of a severe hypersensitivity to TransCon PTH  
• Confirmed neutralizing anti -PTH antibodies that correlate with re duced PD response  
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_13578] (e.g., persistent localized pain or occurrence of a new soft tissue

elevation of bone -specific alkaline phosphatase)  
• Pregnancy  
Ascendis medical monitors will immediately notify the Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC) and 
Ascendis pharmacovigilance of any such events for evaluation of potential broader safety 
concerns  
9.7. TREATMENT COMPLIANCE   
Compliance of both study drug and SoC doses  will be assessed based on review of the subject  
diary and returned pens at every clinic visit.  
9.8. STANDARD OF CARE   
SoC will not be provided by [CONTACT_13641], active vitamin D analog, and ratio of calcium to active vitamin D may di ffer among 
prescriber, patient, and global region (Babey  2018 ).  For example, the prescribed active vitamin 
D or analog and calcium salt may be based on prescriber/individual subject/local preferenc e and 
availability.  The calcium salts are known to differ with respect to ease of absorption, 
requirement of gastric acid for absorption, content (percentage) of elemental calcium - and thus 
size of tablet.  Finally, the proportions of active vitamin D to  calcium supplements may also 
differ based on local practice and diet patterns, and effects on individual subject.  Thus, calcium 
and active vitamin D regimens are highly individualized around the world. Th erefore , the trial 
permits subjects to continue ta king the SoC they were taking prior entering into the trial.  
However, SoC may be reimbursed by [CONTACT_1034]; handling of reimbursement for such expenses 
should follow national legislation and/or guidance.  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma

Note: The thresholds for calcitriol, alfacalcidol, and c alcium are provided above in total 
daily doses. Acknowledging that the total daily doses may be taken in divided doses 
throughout the day, the corresponding thresholds would be calcitriol ≥0.25 μg BID; 
alfacalcidol ≥0.50 μg BID; calcium ≥[ADDRESS_13123] s should receive calcium supplementation in the form of calcium citrate  in case of  
concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors  or anti -acid therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
Subjects may also be on cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and magnesium supplements as part of 
their HP treatment  or to achi eve the recommended daily allowance  (RDA ), as needed to maintain 
target ranges of each.  The 25 (OH) vitamin D target range is 30 -80 ng/mL during treatment 
phases of the trial.  Subjects are to be instructed to take their HP -related suppl ements at 
approximately the same time every day throughout the trial.  Subjects taking a thiazide diuretic 
should discontinue at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline  Screening 24 -hour urine collection  
scheduled  during the week prior to V isit 1.   
9.9.2.  Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13579] : 
• PTH  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13580]  
• Thiazide or loop  diuretics  
• Phosphate  binders (other than calcium supplements)  
• Digoxin , lithium, methotrexate  
• Systemic  corticosteroids (other than as replacement therapy) .  Short course use of steroids 
(≤2 weeks/year) ≤40mg /day is permitted  
• Bisphosphonates   
• Denosumab  
• Biotin >30 µg/day 
For the  open -label extension period, these medications are allowed only if deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_13642]. Use of bisphosphonates or denosumab requires 
consultation with the Medical Monitor to determine potential impact on integrity of relevant 
endpoints.  
TransCon PTH increases calcium, and therefore concomitant use with digoxin (which has a 
narrow therapeutic index) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13124]’s participation is expected to last up to approximately [ADDRESS_13125] study drug administration (plus a recommended period of up to approximately

See Appendix  4 for further details on laboratory assessments to be performed.   
Subjects who sign the ICF form but do not meet one or more eligibility criteria (including 
withdrawing of consent) prior to first study drug dosing will be considered screen failures.  A 
minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of scree n 
failure participants.  Minimal information includes subject ID, demography and reason for screen 
failure (eligibility criteria  or any other reason as applicable ). 
The decision to rescreen will be made on a case by [CONTACT_13644], including which Screening procedures may not need to be repeat ed.  Documentation  for 
rescreening must  include date and reason for initial exclusion.  
10.1.3.  Blinded Treatment Period (Visit 1 - 10, Day 1  to Week 26)   
Subjects will be  randomized in a 3:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups:  
• TransCon PTH 1 8 μg/day* , co-administered with SoC  
• Placebo for TransCon PTH (excipi[INVESTIGATOR_13559])  18 μg/day , co-administered with SoC  
* Dose of TransCon PTH refers to dose of PTH(1 -34) administered  
See Appendix  3 for assessments to be performed within the Blinded Treatment Period . 
Multiple loca l laboratory assessments between Visits 2 and 6 may be necessary to guide 
TransCon PTH /placebo  and potentially SoC dose adjustment . 
In select ed countries, home visits/virtual visits may be performed at V isits 3, 4, 5 , 7 and 8  instead 
of on -site visits.   See Section  10.1.7  for further details.  
In selected  English speaking  countries /sites , approximately 2 weeks prior to the final Blinded 
Treatment Peri od visit (Visit 10), subjects will be contact[CONTACT_13609] a one -hour phone interview 
to occur within 2  weeks after the final Blinded Treatment Period visit (Visit 10) to discuss their 
experience in the trial.  In case of subject discontinuation before or at  Visit 10, the phone 
interview will be scheduled to be completed within 2  weeks  after the Early Termination Visit.  
The phone interview will be conducted by [CONTACT_13610] (see Section  11.9.7 ). 
See Section  11 for further details of procedures and assessments listed in the Schedule of Events .  
See Appendix  4 for further details on laboratory assessments to be performed.   
10.1.4.  Extension Period  (Visit 1 0 - 26 (End of Trial visit) , Week 26  to 182)  
See Appendix  [ADDRESS_13129] ed countries, home visits/virtual visits may be performed at Visits 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 
23, and [ADDRESS_13130] a sustained decline.  
10.1.5.  Unscheduled Visits   
Unscheduled visits ( UVs) are those visits that occur at the clinic between regularly scheduled 
visits at investigator discretion to assess a potential AE, manage an alread y documented AE, 
and/or confirm an abnormal laboratory value requiring Central Laboratory testing.  Only focused 
assessments (guided by [CONTACT_13645]) will occur at these visits.  Unscheduled local 
laboratory visits (ULVs) do not constitute UVs.  
10.1.6.  Unscheduled Lab Visits   
ULVs  are those visits that occur at the local laboratory  between regularly scheduled visits at 
subject or investigator discretion to assess a potential AE , follow -up on an already documented 
AE, confirm an abnormal laboratory value requiring Local Laboratory testing.  This in cludes 
assessment of albumin -adjusted or ionized sCa levels if clinical symptoms of hypo - or 
hypercalcemia  occur at any time during th e trial.  
10.1.7.  Home Visits/Virtual Visits   
Home visits/virtual visits may be conducted in place of in -person on -site visits for visits which 
do not require assessments to be performed on site.  Necessary assessments may be performed by 
a home nurse and the investigational site staff may have a telephone/televideo call with the 
subject to follow up on general health, AEs, concomitant medications etc.  A physical 
assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_13646].  
10.1.8.  Early Termination Visits   
If a subject discontinue the tr ial prematurely an Early Termination  Visit  should be performed, if 
possible .   
If the subject discontinuation occur  prior  to Visit 10, the structure and assessments of the Early 
termination Visit should be as similar as possible to Visit 10.  
If the subject discontinuation occurs  after Visit 10, the  structure and assessments of the E arly 
termina tion Visit should be as similar as possible to Visit 26.  
10.1.9.  Follow up Telephone Contact   
A telephone contact [CONTACT_13647]  2 weeks ( +7 days) after last study drug administration to 
evaluate AEs that w ere ongoing at the final trial visit and to evaluate the subject for any further 
AEs during the [ADDRESS_13131] 5 minutes before vital sign measurement.  The following vital 
signs should be measured:  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581]  
• Body Temperature  
• Orthostatic Blood Pressure  (BP)  & Heart Rate  
Assure subjects are well hydrated prior to assessing orthostatic changes.  
BP and heart rate are measured while the subject is sitting. The s ubject is then asked to stand up 
and, within 2 minutes of doing so, BP and heart rate ar e measured again.  
Orthostasis is defined as a ≥ 20 mmHg decrease in systolic BP, or a ≥10 mmHg decrease in 
diastolic BP, or an increase in heart rate > [ADDRESS_13132] 
(Section  12.1. 3 and Section  12.1.4 ). 
11.2.1.  Post-Dose Orthostatic Measurements   
At Visit 1, a set of orthostatic BP and heart rate should be taken 30 minutes after study drug 
administration.  
At Visit 10, a set of orthostatic BP and heart rate should be taken 30 minutes after TransCon 
PTH  administration for subjects on active vitamin D at Visit 10 or subjects off active v itamin D 
at Visit 10 and taking study drug ≥ 30 µg/day at the end of the Blinded Treatment Period . 
11.3. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION   
A complete physical examination should be performed at Screening . Subsequent physical 
examinations should be performed according to Schedule of Events (see Appendix  3) and may 
be symptom -directed with the specific components performed at Investigator’s disc retion . Height 
and weight will also be measured and recorded  at screening .   
11.4. PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T MED ICATION   
Prior and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13582] -the-counter medications, 
vitamins and herbal/nutritional supplements taken within 26 weeks prior to Visit  1 and through 
the end of the trial, which should be documented with the name [CONTACT_11889]/supplement, 
dosage information including dose, route, and frequency, dates of administration including start 
and end dates, and reason for use.  Past use of PTH  compounds within 5 years  will be captured.

SCORE   
To evaluate bone density and quality, a DXA scan of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip, and forearm, as well as TBS 
scoring m ust be performed.  TBS scoring will not be performed for subjects [ADDRESS_13134]’s daily dietary 
calcium intake.  Af ter the questionnaire is completed, site will enter data into the International 
Osteoporosis Foundation ’s Dietary Calcium Calculator  
(https://www.osteoporosis.foundation/educational -hub/topic/calcium -calculat or) and print out the 
calculated results as source documentation to be entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system by [CONTACT_7893] .  Based on the results, site staff will also  review and counsel subject to 
maintain a reasonably stable dietary c alcium intake during the trial , potentially optimizing their 
nutritional calcium intake to get close to the RDA , as well as avoiding unhealthy intake of 
sodium that can contribute to hypercalciuria.  
11.9. CLINICAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS   
Five subject -completed patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures , and a ClinRO measure  will 
be used in this trial.   In countries where the  HPES and other measures are  available, a ll 
participants will be expected to complete the HPES and the other available measures.   
Note: All PROs must be completed by [CONTACT_13648].   
11.9.1.  Hypoparathyroid ism Patient Experience Scale   
The HPES  measures are  disease -specific PRO s that were  developed and validated by [CONTACT_13649] -reported symptom and disease impacts.  The HPES -Symptom  
assesses the key HP -related physical and cognitive symptoms from the patient perspective .  The 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13135] assesses  the key impacts of these symptoms on patient functioning and well -being  
(physical functioning, daily life, psychological well -being, social  life and relationships) .   
The HPES takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete .   
11.9.3.  EuroQol 5 -dimensional questionnaire   
The EuroQol 5 -dimensional ( EQ-5D) questionnaire  is a widely used generic health measure that 
can be  applied to a wide range of health conditions.  This measure is used to quantify health 
related  QOL  and measures a patient’s health across five different domains: mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  The measure consists of two 
components: health state description and evaluation.  In the description part, heal th status is 
measured in terms of the five dimensions.  The respondents rate the level of severity for each 
dimension using a five-level (EQ -5D-5L) scale.   In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate 
their overall health status using a  EuroQol  visual analogue scale  (EQ-VAS).   
The EQ-5D-5L takes approximately 5 minutes  to complete.  
11.9.4.  36-Item Short -Form Survey   
The 36 -Item Short -Form Survey (SF -36) V2  Health Survey  (1-week  recall ) is a multipurpose 
short -form health survey with 36 questions that yields an eight -scale profile of functional health 
and general well-being, as well as two psychometrically based physical and mental health 
summary measures and a preference -based health u tility index.  It is a practical, reliable and 
valid measure of physical and mental health.   The SF -36 is a generic health survey as it can be 
used across age (18 and older), disease, and treatment group, as opposed to a disease -specific 
health survey, whi ch focuses on a particular condition or disease.   
The SF -36 can be completed in 5-10 minutes.

The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) is a ClinRO  measure .  It should be 
completed by [CONTACT_13650]. The CGI -S consists of 
[ADDRESS_13136]’s overall 
symptoms, physical symptoms, and cognitive symptoms based on the investigator’s clinical 
judgement, and their impression of the subject’s disease from the summary of all as sessments 
and information collected at the visit.  The CGI -S provides a clinician’s view of the subject’s 
disease status, which is valuable in correlating the subject’s self -assessment of their disease 
status.  
The CGI -S takes approximately 1 -2 minutes to complete . 
11.9.7.  Phone Exit Interviews   
Phone interviews after the Blinded Treatment Period , in selected English speaking countries/sites 
are used to assess the subject’s experience in the trial in their own words and supply a qualitative 
view to complement the quantitative clinical outcome assessments ( COAs ).  The exit interviews 
will collect information on  subject ’s evaluation of treatment received, and the subject’s  
experience of taking part in the clinical trial , and aid in the interpretation of changes in clinical 
and PRO  scores, including  the HPES -Symptom and HPES -Impact measures, to determine what 
constitutes mea ningful  change for patients with HP.  
11.10.  LOCAL TOLERABILITY A SSESSMENT   
Local Tolerability is assessed based on the presence of an injection site reaction (ISRs)  captured 
as an AE  (see section [IP_ADDRESS]  for ISR reporting) .   
At Visit 1, assessment of local tolerability including redness, itching and swelling is performed 
by [CONTACT_13651] [ADDRESS_13137] dose of open -label TransCon PTH is  administered on -site only for subjects 
still taking active vitamin D  or subjects off active vitamin D  and taking  study drug  dose 
≥30 μg/day at the end of Blinded Treatment Period .  An assessment of local tolerability 
including redness, itching and swelling is performed by [CONTACT_13652] [ADDRESS_13138] -dose.    
As part of the local tolerability assessment at Visit 1 and 10, the subjec t will  complete the Wong -
Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale to assess the pain at the injection site th at the subject is 
experiencing afte r the injection.   
11.12.  SUBJECT DIARY   
Subjects are trained on the diary during Screening and the diary should be reviewed at the visit 
by [CONTACT_13653]/PRN  medication doses review.   CCI
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13139]’s own device or with a provision device.  
Subjects will be required to complete a daily diary until Visit 1 3 to capture the following:  
• Study drug, starting at Visit 1 (administration date and time , dos e, location of injection site ) 
• SoC (administration date , name  [CONTACT_13691]), including PRN  medication doses  
Subjects will be required to complete a weekly  diary starting from  Visit 1 3 to Visit 18  to capture 
TransCon PTH  administration  and any SoC/ PRN  medication doses .  
Paper diary might be used as back -up solution.  
Diary completion during the Screening Period assists in tracking SoC optimization.  The 
minimum 7  days between the Screening Period and Visit 1 should be used as an opportunity for 
subjects  who are already optimized on HP -related supplements prior  to Screening to become 
acquainted with the diary prior to enrollment/randomization.

At each  visit, the subject should be asked about the following to assess for any potential AEs:  
• General well -being  
• Any changes to health or medications since the previous visit  
• Hypo - or hypercalcemic symptoms since the previous visit  
• Vasodilatory symptoms as adverse events of special interest  (AESI ) 
• Emergency/urgent care visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13584], the site staff will review subject diary data to determine if diary entries reflect any 
AEs with a reference to the AE section  and at applicable visits, changes from baseline noted 
during a physical examination should be assessed for potential AEs.  
At the investigator’s discretion, additional assessments, including an examination of injection 
sites, a physical examination, or add itional laboratory assessment, may be performed even if not 
required at the specific trial visit or if an UV or ULV must be scheduled.   
See Section  12.3 for details on reporting AEs.  
11.14.  LABORATORY ASSESSMEN TS  
Samples will be obtained at a minimum for both central and local laboratory tests to be 
performed as outlined in  Appendix  4. 
Note:  
• Blood collection must occur prior to on -site study drug administration, when applicable  
• On the day of lab assessments, subjects shou ld avoid exercise prior to blood collection  
• On the day of lab assessments, subjects should be instructed to take their S oC (as 
applicable) and eat their usual breakfast prior to blood collection  
Investigators must be able to receive local laboratory result s within a time frame sufficent to 
allow instructions to subjects on dose adjustments preferably  within [ADDRESS_13140] experience a suspected anaphylactic reaction (excluding anaphylactic reactions due 
to confirmed exposure to an allergen known to be a trigger for an individual subje ct), blood 
should be drawn as soon as possible (ideally within 48 hours) for tryptase and total IgE.   The 
subject should also be further evaluated (by [CONTACT_1755]/or an allergist or similar 
specialist) to confirm/refute an anaphylactic reaction th rough a thorough history, with 
consideration given to interval testing of tryptase, total IgE, and a re -challenge with study drug.  
Samples for measuring Free PTH will be collected in a subset of subjects at selected sites.   The 
aim is to obtain samples fro m as many subjects as possible but expect a  minimum of 
approximately 30% of the subjects.  
11.15.  LIFESTYLE MODIFICATI ON  
11.15.1.  Dietary Modifications   
Subjects should be advised to consume approximately the same amount of calcium from their 
diet every day to minimize the effect of dietary calcium on fluctuation in sCa level.  The 
Investigator or site staff will counsel the subjects about their dietary calcium intake based on the 
dietary calcium questionnaire and counseled to avoid excessive sodium intake.  
11.15.2.  Exercise Modifications   
Subjects should be advised to avoid exercise prior to visits which include blood  collection.  
11.15.3.  Contraception   
TransCon PTH did not induce adverse effects on male or female fertility in dedicated fertility 
studies conducted in rats.  Further, TransCon PTH did not induce adverse effects on embryofetal 
developmental in pregnant rats and rabbits  (see Investiga tor’s Brochure  
Section  4.4.4  – Reproductive Performance and Developmental Toxicity Studies ).  
Irrespectively, acceptable  highly effective contraception during the trial and for [ADDRESS_13141] dose of study drug is required for women of childbearing  potential if sexually active, and 
pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential will be performed throughout the trial.  
See Appendix  1 for further guidance on acceptable  highly effective contraception.  
See Appendix  4 for further details on pregnancy testing schedule.

For the subjects still on active vitamin D at Visit 1 0 or the subjects off active vitamin D  at Visit 
10 and taking TransCon PTH/placebo do se ≥30 µg/day  at the end of Blinded Treatment Period , 
the first dose of open -label TransCon PTH is administered by [CONTACT_13654], and the 
subjects will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_13143] the site and visit th e local laboratory ( i.e., ULV) to assess albumin -adjusted or ionized 
sCa.  Additionally, as in normal management of patients with HP, all subjects will be permitted 
to take extra active vitamin D and/or calcium supplements as PRN  medications to resolve 
symptoms of hypocalcemia, and reduce calcium and/or active vitamin D supplements (or 
hold/reduce their dose of Transcon PTH if off S oC) to resolve acute symptoms of hypercalcemia.  
Subjects should be encouraged to visit the local laboratory for assessment of sCa and albumin, or 
ionized calcium levels for symptoms of hypercalcemia.  
12. ADVERSE EVENT ASSESS MENT AND REPORTING   
12.1. DEFINITION   
12.1.1.  Adverse Event   
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subje ct administered  a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An Adverse event can therefore be any of the following : 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
or other protocol -imposed intervention,  regardless of attribution . 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with  hypoparathyroidism  that were 
not present prior to the AE reporting period.   
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 89 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).   
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run -in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.   
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studi ed) judged by [CONTACT_13655] -specified AE reporting period.   
12.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events   
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that meets any of the following criteria:  
• It results in death (i.e. the AE  cause  or leads to death).   
• It is life threatening (i.e. the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk  of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue , might have caused death).   
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).   
• It results in a congenita l anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
the study drug .  
• It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] 
(e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical interventio n  to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above).  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe ; see Section  12.3.1 ; the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings.  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious AEs are required to be reported by [CONTACT_13657] (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  12.5.2  for reporting instructions).  
12.1.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)    
AESIs are a subset of Events to Monitor (EtMs) of scientific and potential medical concern 
specific to the product, for which ongoing monitoring and reported by [CONTACT_13658] 
24 hours to the Sponsor is required. Such an event might require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  Depen ding on the nature of the event, rapid communication by 
[CONTACT_13659] (e.g. Regulatory Authorities) may also be warranted.  
12.1.4.  TransCon PTH Adverse Events of Special Interest   
AEs of special interest for this study include the following:  
• Vasodilatory signs and symptoms which may include orthostatic dizziness, lightheadedness, 
weakness, blurring of vision, pre -syncope, syncope, headache, orthostatic hypotension, 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 90 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  orthostatic tachycardia/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. Such symptoms are usually transient in nature and can be 
managed by [CONTACT_13660], while reclining. PTH is known to have vasodilatory effects 
(Rambausek  1982) 
• Persistent severe hypocalcemia (as defined in Section  9.6.1 ) 
• Persistent severe hypercalcemia (as defined in Section  9.6.1 ) 
12.1.5.  Special Situation   
Special situations are non -standard medical conditions that provide valuable information (e.g. 
clinical, safety) about a medicinal product, even when they do not occur in association with an 
AE or medical condition. Examples of special situations include a nd should all be captured in the 
eCRF:  
• Pregnancy  
• Breastfeeding  
• Overdose  
• Drug abuse  
• Misuse  
• Occupational exposure  
• Lack of therapeutic efficacy  
• Medication error  
The Medical Monitor will review all safety information on an ongoing basis.   
12.2. METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RE CORDING SAFETY 
VARIABLES   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs, AESIs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study are collecte d and reported to  Ascendis  Pharma, in accordance with 
FDA CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports) and ICH E6 . 
12.3. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING PERIOD   
The Adverse Event Reporting Period is the per iod requiring reporting of AEs, AESIs and SAEs 
for any subjects exposed to  IMP product and or any study related procedures.   Reporting period 
begins from the time when the informed consent is obtained and ends [ADDRESS_13144] 
administration of s tudy treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. 
After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment Severity, Causality, and Outcome Assessment . 
12.3.1.  Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events   
The World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading scale will be used for assessing AE 
severity.  Table  2 will be used for assessing severity for AEs that are not specifically listed in the 
WHO toxicity grading scale.  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 91 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Table  2: Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically Listed in 
WHO Toxicity Grading Scale   
Grade  Severity  
1 Mild; transient or mild discomfort (  48 hours); no medical intervention or therapy required  
2 Moderate; mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention or therapy required  
3 Severe; marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical intervention or 
therapy  required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]  
4 Life-threatening; extreme limitation in activity; significant assistance required; significant medical 
intervention or therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13585], some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to definition of a serious AE (see 
Section  12.1.2 ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Causality Rating   
All AEs, AESIs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_13661], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other me ans 
must be reported appropriately.  
Each reported AE, AESIs or SAE must be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), 
seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the TransCon PTH (see following 
guidance), and actions taken.   To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, 
investigators should apply the following general guideline:  
Related (Yes) – There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of TransCon PTH.   The AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   The AE follows a known pattern 
of response to TransCon PTH or with similar treatments.   And/or the AE abates or resolves 
upon discontinuation of TransCon  PTH or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon 
re-challenge.  
Not Related (No) – Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the TransCon PTH 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitan t 
medication).   The AE has no plausible temporal relationship to TransCon PTH 
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_13145] dose of study drug).  
Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the current Investigator ’s 
Brochure . 
Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the current IB or not identified.   This includes AEs for 
which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Outcome Assessment   
Subjects will be followed until AEs have either resolved, subjects have returned to their baseline 
status, or subjects are deemed stable or commensurate with ongoing disease processes.   One of  
five outcomes listed below must be recorded:  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 92 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Recovered/Resolved  – The event has stopped . The stop date of the event must be recorded.  
Recovering/Resolving  – The subject is clearly recovering from an event.  The event is not yet 
completely resolved.  
Not Re covered/Not Resolved  – The event is still ongoing. (Could include stable  
and commensurate with ongoing disease processes).  
Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  – The event has reached a state where  no further changes 
are expected,  and the residual symptoms are  assumed to persist.  An example is hemiparesis 
after stroke.    
The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of SAE, the sequelae should be 
specified.  
Fatal  – The subject has died as a consequent of the event.  Date of death is recorded as stop 
date for the AE.  
Unknown  – Unknown to investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow up.  
12.4. PROCEDURES FOR ELICI TING, RECORDING AND REPORTING ADVERSE 
EVENTS   
12.4.1.  Eliciting Adverse Events   
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points should be 
adopted.  Examples of non -directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”   
12.4.2.  Recording Procedures for All Adverse Events   
All AEs will be documented in response to question about the subject’s well -being and whether 
any possible changes in well -being have occurred since the previous visit.  
AEs, including AESIs and SAEs, will be documented through the end of the subject’s  
participation in the trial or Early Termina tion Visit.  All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF. AEs either observed by [CONTACT_13663].  The following attributes must be documented for each reported AE:  
• Subject ID   
• Descr iption   
• Onset date (if AE was present on Day 1, include whether onset was prior to or after the first 
dose of the study drug)  
• Resolution date, if applicable  
• Severity  
• Causality (relationship to the study drug)   
• Outcome  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 93 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  • Action taken  
• Determination of “serious ness criteria” (whether serious or not serious)  
Any medical history condition, signs, symptoms, and illnesses active during the Screening 
Period will be captured as baseline (preexisting) events, if appropriate, to assure that any 
change(s) in these experi ences during the trial also are recorded as an AE and a complete safety 
profile is obtained.  An event that occurs after signing of ICF but prior to the first study drug 
administration will be documented as medical history unless the event is trial procedu re–related, 
in which case it will be reported as a non –treatment -emergent AE.   Any new or worsening 
pretreatment event that occurs from the time of the first study drug administration until the EOT 
Visit will be recorded as an AE.  
Routine titration of chro nic, concomitant medications will not be considered to meet the criteria 
for AEs.  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs, AESIs  or 
SAEs.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviation (e.g.,  hypertension  for elevated  BP that persists  
and requires  chronic  treatment  and follow -up, or increased  blood  pressure  for elevated  blood  
pressure  that occurs  for a limited  time and does not persist  or require  ongoing  treatment).  
AEs will be documented  at the maximum  intensity  experienced . If a previously  recorded  and 
closed  AE or condition  recorded  as part of medical  history  increases  in severity  or frequency,  it 
will be recorded  as a new AE.  
An accidental overdose is not an AE if there are no signs or symptoms.  Any undesirable medical 
occurrence resulting from an accidental overdose is an AE and should be recorded and reported 
on the appropriate eCRF.  Regardless of classification as an AE or not,  all overdoses should be 
documented, and the subject(s) monitored.  Since accidental overdo ses with the study drug could 
have serious clinical consequences and/or represent a compliance issue, they should be reported 
to the Medical Monitor immediately and evaluated by [CONTACT_1034].   
12.4.3.  Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Abnormal Laboratory Values   
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A laboratory test result must be  reported as 
an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification or titration, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) .  Abnormal serum calcium  values will not be 
considered AEs unless associated with a sign or symptom*  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypo kalemia) or a 
change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings.   Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be 
classified as an AE. 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 94 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
* Abnormal serum calcium values - whether or not associated with titration of study drug, 
calcium, or active vitamin D doses - will not be considered AEs  unless associated with a sign or 
symptom. Serum calcium is a pharmacodynamic marker of study drug therapy and thus used to 
guide titration of study drug, calcium, and active vitamin D doses (per Appendix  2). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Abnormal Vital Sign Values   
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE.  A vital sign result must be reported as an 
AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or 
treatment discontinuation)  
• Results  in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be 
classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  high 
blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be recorded on th e Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should 
only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms   
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms  (e.g. record only heart failure  rather than dyspnea, orthopnea and extremity edema) .  
However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a 
single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable to report the information 
that is currently available  as separate AEs.  If a diagnosis is su bsequently established, it should 
be reported as follow -up information.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Injection Site Reactions   
ISRs that occur during or after study drug administration and that are judged to be related to 
study drug injection  are deemed to be AEs . These AEs  should be captured as a unified diagnos is 
on the AE eCRF (e.g. as an “injection site reaction ” rather than capturing “injection site 
bleeding ” and “injection site induration ” as separate adverse events).  The diagnosis is at the 
discretion of the investigator. Signs, symptoms , and features of the injection s ite reaction  should 
be recorded on a dedicated  corresponding eCRF.

TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 95 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Deaths    
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period, regardless of attribution, 
will be reported to the appropriate parties.  When recording a death, the event or condition that 
caused or contributed to t he fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept.  If 
the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report 
“Unexplained Death”.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13586].   If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of  an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reported as the SAE.  For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13587], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13588]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13589]   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13590] y measurement for the 
study or   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13591]   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Preexisting Medical Conditions    
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history.   A preexisting medical condition should be 
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condition worsens during the study.   When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_13665] (e.g., “more frequent  headaches”).   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy    
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving the study drug or within two weeks  after 
the last dose of study drug, or if the female partner of a  male study subject becomes pregnant 
while the study subject is receiving the study drug or within  two weeks , a Pregnancy report 
should be completed and expeditiously submitted to  Ascendis  Pharma.  Follow -up to obtain the 
outcome of the pregnancy should al so occur and the outcome reported to Ascendis  Pharma.  
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, 
and expeditiously reported as an SAE.   Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child 
born to a female subject exposed to the study drug  should be expeditiously reported as an SAE.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Product  Complaints    
A Product Complaint is defined as any written or oral information r eceived from a complainant 
that alleges deficiencies related to identity, quality, safety, strength, purity, reliability, durability, 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13146] the 
information  to the Sponsor immediately (refer to the pharmacy manual for further details).  If the 
medical device results in an adverse event to the study patient, the event must be reported on the 
AE eCRF and submitted through the EDC system.  If the event is serious, the A E eCRF must be 
completed immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), as outline d in 
Section  12.5.2 . 
12.5. SAFETY REPORTING REQ UIREMENTS   
12.5.1.  Non-Serious Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation   
If situation  permits,  non-serious  events  (including  laboratory  abnormalities  and pregnancies)  that 
may require  permanent  discontinuation  of study drug should  be discussed  with the Medical  
Monitor  prior  to making  any final decision.  
12.5.2.  Reporting   
All initial and follow -up information regarding SAEs, AESIs , and Special Situati ons 
reporting  must be reported by [CONTACT_13666] 
24 hours of discovery/awareness, including those related to protocol -mandated procedures and 
regardless of suspected causality.  
For each AE recorded on the AE eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness 
(see Section  12.1.2  for seriousness criteria), severity  (Section  12.3.1 ), and causality (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Reporting must not be delayed by [CONTACT_13667].   The minimum information 
required for reporting an SAE, AESIs, and Special Situations are the AE term (diagnosis), 
patient, study drug, reporter, and the investigator’s initial causality assessment.   Additional 
information must be reported to the Sponsor o r its representatives as a follow -up report.   All 
SAEs, AESIs,  and Special Situations (including follow -up information) must be reported using 
the Safety report form or the Pregnancy report form provided. A completed Safety report form / 
Pregnancy report f orm must be uploaded to the Safety Reporting Portal at : 
Safety.ascendispharma.com  
Specific instructions regarding completion of the form and reporting details are provided on the 
Safety report form.  
SAEs, AESIs, and Special Situations information is  colle cted and reported via SAE Forms 
provided by [CONTACT_13668].  Pregnancy information is collected and reported 
via Pregnancy Forms provided by [CONTACT_13668].   The Sponsor (or its 
representatives) is responsible for repo rting within the time frame required by [CONTACT_13669]:

• Central IRBs/HRECs/IECs (if applicable).   
• National ethics committees (if applicable).   
• Appropriate regulatory authorities.  
It is the investigat ors’ responsibility to comply with the requirements of their local 
IRB/HREC/IEC for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs, other SAEs, and any new and/or relevant safety 
information provided by [CONTACT_13670].  At minimum, S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be 
brought to the atte ntion of these review boards in accordance with regional regulations.  
13. SAFETY MONITORING   
The Sponsor will conduct an ongoing review of all trial data, with particular attention given to 
laboratory findings (in particular related  to albumin adjusted serum calcium, ionized calcium),  
AEs, and concomitant medications.  Any important safety trends or other findings considered 
related to the study drug will be reported to the investigators and to regulatory authorities.  In 
particular, the Sponsor will notify investigators and regulatory authorities of AEs that:  
• Fulfill the criteria for S[LOCATION_003]Rs.   
• Occu r at a meaningfully greater frequency than described in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure  Section 6 .8 – Reference Safety Information for Assessment of Expectedness of 
Serious Adverse Reactions . 
Any AE that occurs  during  the clinical trial must be monitored and followed up until:  
• It has resolved or receded  
• Pathology laboratory findings have returned to normal  
• Steady -state has been achieved  
• It has been shown to be unrelated to the study drug and/or trial related procedure  
Details  will be described in  the Safety Management Plan.  
14. DEVICE ASSOCIATED HA ZARDS, RISKS, AND AD VERSE EVENTS   
During the device development process, risk management activities have been performed 
according to ISO [ZIP_CODE].  Risk analyses have been performed using Failure Mode and Effects 
Analysis  techniques to address risks related to design, use and manufacturing of the TransCon 
PTH prefilled pen.  The severity of hazards related to risks has been assessed and  used to ensure 
appropriate risk mitigation and evaluation of residual risks.   The severity rating applied 
throughout the TransCon PTH prefilled pen risk management activities are listed in Table  3. 
An analysis of risks associated with the use  of the TransCon PTH prefilled pen has been 
performed.  This analysis addressed [ADDRESS_13147] been mitigated or 
reduced to an acceptable level by [CONTACT_13671]  (IFU).   The use related risk 
analysis of the TransCon PTH prefilled pen identifies three residual risks related to a potential 
hazard with a severity r ating of S4  or above.  These three risks relate to swallowing of small 
parts (choking hazard), cross contamination between multiple users and infections.  These are 
class -related risks related to the single use needle or to the single patient use prefilled  pen.  These 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13148] bee n developed and tested through a series of formative usability 
studies (one platform prefilled pen study and six TransCon PTH prefilled pen studies).  In 
conclusion the usability testing of the TransCon PTH prefilled pen, packaging and  IFU supported 
the ef fectiveness of the  risk mitigation s as well as the safe and effective use for both untrained 
and trained intended users.  Finally, it is noted, that the risk analysis did not identify a need for 
cleaning of the device during its use period.   The risk evalu ation including the assessment of the 
residual risks concludes that the use of the TransCon PTH prefilled pen is safe and effective.  
The Phase 2 trial (TransCon PTH TCP -201) has been conducted using the TransCon PTH 
prefilled pen configurations that are al so intended to be used in the Phase 3 trial  (TCP-304).  No 
AEs relating to the device constituent of the TransCon PTH prefilled pen has been reported.   
Less than ten complaints relating to the device constituent, IFU and needles have been registered 
during  the clinical trial.  One complaint has led to a minor update of the IFU and the rest have 
not triggered any changes.

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  15.2.3.  Exploratory Endpoints   
15.3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) Population consists of all subjects who were randomized and received 
at least one dose of blinded study drug .  All efficacy analysis will be based on ITT and treatment 
assignment per randomization.  The Safety Analysis Population consists of all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.   The safety analyses will be based on the 
Safety Analysis Population and actual treatment received.  
In general, descriptive statistics  summary will be generated by [CONTACT_13672] . 
Categorical data will be  presented using counts and percentages of subject s.  Continuous 
variables will be  presented using number of subject s, mean, standard deviation ( SD)/standard 
error ( SE), median, minimum and maximum.  
Efficacy  Analysis  
The primary estimand for the primary analysis  is defined by [CONTACT_13673]:  
x Population: Refer to Section  8 Trial Population, with inclusion/exclusion criteria considered. 
The efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT Population  
x Efficacy Endpoints: Refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
x Handling missing data (intercurrent events): Subjects may have missing data for primary 
endpoint assessments due to early discontinua tion from study drug, missing lab visits,  non-
evaluable lab values, etc. Such subjects will be included in primary analysis. Subjects with 
no Week 26 albumin -adjusted sCa OR  with >25% (i.e., >7 days) missing diary data of active 
vitamin D or calcium during the 4 weeks will be considered as non -responders.  
x Analysis: CMH  test stratified by [CONTACT_13611]  (post -surgical vs. other)  is 
the primary analysis method and will be used to  compare the proportion of subjects meeting 
the listed criteria of the primary endpoint (responders vs. non -responders) in the TransCon 
PTH vs. placebo groups  
x Population -level summary: Number and percentage of subjects meeting the primary endpoint 
criteria defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  will be provided . 
Sequen tial testing  will be applied to control the family -wise type -[ADDRESS_13151] of any 
anti-PTH , anti -TransCon PTH  and anti -PEG antibodies detected will be  included in the 
evaluation .  The Free PTH results will additional ly be added to the population PK analysis . 
Safety Analysis  
The reporting of  the safety data is descriptive.  Descriptive analysis will include the incidence 
TEAEs, and changes in laboratory,  vital signs, and  pre-existing  and treatment induced , anti-PTH , 
anti-TransCon PTH  and anti -PEG antibodies responses .  Listings of all safety endpoints by 
[CONTACT_2058].   
Interim Analysis  
The analysis of the Blinded Treatment Period wil l be conducted after database lock of the 
Blinded Treatment Period, which will occur prior to database lock of the Extension Period.  No 
interim analysis is planned . 
15.4. POWER CALCULATION   
The sample size is determined based on considerations from both statistical power and adequate 
safety exposure perspectives.  Assuming  that the response rate is 70% for TransCon PTH and 
15% for placebo for the primary endpoint at 26 weeks, 68  subjects randomized 3:[ADDRESS_13152] approximate statistical powers of  99% at alpha =  0.05, and 
95% at alpha =  0.01 ( two-sided) to demonstrate s tatistically significant difference between  
TransCon PTH and placebo.   Taking into account of approximately 10% dropout, a total sample 
size of 76 is targeted.  
15.5. SIGNIFICANCE   
Statistical significanc e is defined as P <0.05 (2 -Sided).   
15.6. ACCOUNTABILITY   
Subjects with missing data, including missed assessments and early discontinuation will be 
summarized.  
15.7. DEVIATION REPORTING   
Major protocol deviations will be summarized.  
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13153] should be unblinded by [CONTACT_13674] ( e.g., event concerning subject safety) and only if knowledge of the 
treatment  assignment is urgently needed for the clinical management or welfare of the subject.  
The investigator is encouraged to notify the Medical Monitor or clinical program manager before 
unblinding, when possible, but priority should be given to treatment of t he subject.  
The Investigator must record the date and reason for revealing the blinded treatment assignment 
for that subject within the I RT.  Treatment assignment may be unblinded by [CONTACT_13675].  The system to unblind 
an assignment will be maintained and executed through the I RT, which will be available 
[ADDRESS_13154] undergo appropriate 
training on the trial protocol and ancillary trial procedures and documents through participation 
in a Site Initiation Visit (SIV) or  an Investigator Meeting (IM).  Protocol and GCP training must 
take place before any subjec ts are enrolled at a site.  SIVs and IMs will include, but may not be 
limited to, study drug preparation and administration procedures, data collection requirements, 
and subject eligibility requirements.  
16.2. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]   
16.2.1.  Collection  of Data   
Data will be collected in the eCRF .  The eCRF is an integral part of the trial and subsequent 
reports.   It must be used to capture trial -specific data collected and must be kept current to reflect 
subject status during the course of the trial.  Only a Subject Identification Number will be used to 
identify the subject.   The investigator must keep a separate Subject Identification Code List with 
subject names and medical record numbers (or other personal identifiers).  
The trial will use an Internet -based remote data entry system to collect clinical trial data at the 
investigational sites.   The system complies with 21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 (R2) GCP.   The 
system will be used to enter, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit data.  The system 
is configured based on the requirements from the Sponsor.   Source documents are to be retained 
to enabl e a reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source  documents include the site files and 
trial worksheets provided by [CONTACT_1034].  Data will be recorded in the trial worksheets as 
appropriate to complete and/or clarify the source data.  
The design of t he computerized system complies with all the applicable regulatory requirements 
for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13592] [21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 (R2) GCP ] 
to the same degree of confidence as is provided with paper systems.   Clinical  investigators must 
retain either the original or a certified copy of all source, including query resolution 
correspondence.  The system is designed so that changes to any record do not obscure the 
original information.  The audit record clearly indicates tha t a change was made and clearly 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.[ADDRESS_13155] an 
electronic audit trail, in accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e).  Electronic signatures will be used in 
conformance with [ADDRESS_13156], which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classific ation system.  
Medical history for illnesses  and AEs will be coded  using the medical dictionary for regulatory 
activities ( MedDRA ).   
16.2.3.  Data H andling   
eCRFs should be completed in a  timely manner to enable the sponsor or designee to perform 
central monitoring of data. Subsequent to data entry, a study monitor may perform source data 
verification within the EDC system.  Original entries as well as any changes to data fields will be 
stored in the audit trail of the system.  Prior to database lock, the investigator will use his/her log 
in credentials to confirm that the forms have been reviewed, and that the entries accurat ely 
reflect the information in the source documents.  The eCRF captures the data required per the 
protocol schedule of events and procedures.   System -generated or manual queries will be issued 
to the investigative site staff as data discrepancies are ident ified by [CONTACT_13676], who 
routinely review the data for completeness, correctness, and consistency.   The site is responsible 
for responding to the queries in a timely manner, within the system, either by [CONTACT_13677] g the original entry, and by [CONTACT_13678] ( e.g., data 
entry error).   At the conclusion of the trial, Sponsor will provide the site with a read -only archive 
copy of the data entered by [CONTACT_10867].  This archive must be stored in accord ance with the records 
retention requirements outlined in Section  16.2.[ADDRESS_13157] Access  to Source Data /Documents   
The investigator/trial site is to provide direct access to source data/documents for trial -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB/ EC review, and regulatory inspection.

are being appropriately collected  and reported.  Queries and corrections will be made as needed.  
16.3.2.  Data  Management   
Sponsor or designee will be responsible for activities associated with the data management of 
this trial.   The standard procedures for handling and processing records will be followed per GCP 
and Sponsor and/or CRO’s standard operating procedures (SOPs).   A comprehensive data 
management plan will be developed including a data management overview, database 
deve lopment, validation and maintenance, data entry and processing, external data transfer, data 
validation and archive, and medical coding processes.   Trial site personnel will be responsible for 
providing resolutions to all data queries.  The investigator wi ll be required to document 
electronic data review to ensure the accuracy of the corrected and/or clarified data.  
16.4. AUDITING PROCEDURES   
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a GCP Quality Assurance audit may be 
initiated by [CONTACT_1034].  The investigator has to ensure that subjects/parents/legal guardians are 
aware of and consent to personal information being reviewed during th e data verification process 
as a part of monitoring/auditing/inspection by [CONTACT_1034], properly authorized agents of the 
Sponsor, or competent authorities.  In addition, participation and personal information is treated 
Clinical Trial Protocol   Ascendis Pharma  
TCP-304, Version  7.0  Page 106 of 125 
VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  as strictly confidential to the ext ent that applicable law permits and to which it is not publicly 
available.  The purpose of audits and inspections is to evaluate compliance with the principles of 
GCP, international and local regulatory requirements, and the trial protocol.  The audit or 
inspection may include, for example, a review of all source documents, drug records, original 
clinic medical notes, and some or all of the facilities used in the trial.  
The audits may be conducted by [CONTACT_13679]’s selected agent in accordance wit h 
Sponsor’s SOP or SOPs of the selected and properly authorized agent.  A competent authority 
may also wish to conduct an inspection during the trial or after its completion.  If an inspection is 
requested by a competent authority, the investigator must in form the Sponsor immediately that 
this request has been made.  The investigator and his/her institution will permit all monitoring, 
audits, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source data.  
16.5. LABORATORY QUALITY S TANDARDS   
Laboratory tests or evaluations described in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with 
quality laboratory standards as described in the SOPs of the local and central laboratories.  Some 
blood samples may be used for laboratory test validation.  
The laboratories will provide a list of reference ranges for applicable analyses before trial start.  
These will be held in the investigator site file and the trial master file.  The methods employed  
for each assay should be available upon request.  Any change in the laboratory procedures, 
reference values, etc., during the trial must promptly be communicated to the Sponsor.  The 
laboratories may also be audited by [CONTACT_13680]. 
16.6. TRIAL TERMINATION OR  COMPLETION   
The investigator should notify the IRB/ EC in writing of the completion or early termination of 
the trial.  End of trial  (EOT)  is defined as last subject last visit.    
Upon trial completion or termination, applicable regulatory reporting requirements will be 
followed.  The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trial at any time for any reason 
including insufficient efficacy  and unanticipated safety concerns.   If the trial is premature ly 
terminated , the investigator should promptly inform the subjects and ensure approp riate therapy 
and follow -up. 
The Sponsor may stop this trial at a particular site for any of the following re asons:  
• The site cannot enroll an adequate number of subjects  
• Serious and/or persistent non -compliance with the protocol or clinical trial conduct  
• Careless or premeditated false documentation in the eCRF  
• Inadequate cooperation with the investigator

APPENDIX  1. CONTRACEPTION   
Highly effective contraception are methods  that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per 
year when used consistently and correctly, following the CTFG  2014  recommendations , such 
methods include :   
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence, defined as refraining from h eterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the study treatments  
• Postmenopausal.  A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause  
Methods of contraception with a failure rate o f more than 1% per year with consistent adherence 
are not permitted  for female participants of childbearing potential . Periodic abstinence (calendar, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and 
lactational  amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception.

VV-SUB -023233 -12.0  CONFIDENTIAL  1 At Visit 1 (Week 0, Day 1), start study drug at 18 µg/day and decrease active vitamin D dose by 33 -50% (e.g., skip second dose of the day if taking BID, and 
skip final dose of the day if taking TID).  
2 Study drug  refers to TransCon PTH or placebo.  
3 sCa refers to either albumin -adjusted sCa and/or ionized calcium. For the purposes of this trial, the normal ranges are: albumin -adjusted sCa 8.3 -10.6 mg/dL 
(2.07 -2.64 mmol/L); ionized calcium 1.16 -1.32 mmol/L.  
4 If albumin -adjusted sCa ≥12.0 mg/dL (3.00 mmol /L) or ionized  calcium ≥1.50 mmol/L , hold study drug for approximately 2 -3 days. Remember to resume 
study drug therapy afterwards. Also reduce study drug, active vitamin D, or calcium as per algorithm.  
5 Check sCa within 7-14 days after any changes in stud y drug dose ; standing calcium , standing vitamin D doses ; or sCa outside the normal range . A scheduled 
visit or LV within 7-14 days meets this requirement. When scheduled study visits occur less frequently (e.g. 13 weeks apart) then an ULV should be pu rsued .   
6 The goal is to demonstrate independence from therapeutic doses of calcium supplements. In case needed to meet recommended die tary intake of calcium, it is 
permitted to take calcium supplements ≤600 mg/day as a nutritional supplement for the sake of r eaching the recommended dietary intake.  
Notes:  
Adjustments of study drug , calcium and/or active vitamin D will be made per the titration algorithm based on the results of the most recent laboratory results  
whether scheduled or unscheduled.  When central an d local calcium values are obtained concurrently, local values should be used to guide titration.  
At all times during the trial, subjects with symptoms  of hyp ocalcemia may take  PRN  doses of calcium (preferred) and/or active vitamin D,  and/or do an  ULV 
visit to measure sCa . Subjects with  symptoms  of hyp ercalcemia may  hold doses of study drug for 1 day  and/or do an ULV to  measure sCa . An ULV must be 
performed within 7  days of a PRN supplement dose  or a held dose. If due to symptoms  >2 PRN doses of SoC   are taken or >2 doses of SoC and/or study drug are 
held within those [ADDRESS_13162] PRN or held dose.

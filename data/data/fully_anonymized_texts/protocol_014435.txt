OBJECTIVES : 
 
1.0 Research Aims:  
 
1.   Research Question:  
Is there a detectable difference upper extremity strength as measured with 
dynamometry after cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_263093] a steroid diluent in patients with cervical radiculitis?  
 
2.   Null Hypothesis:  
There is no difference in upper extremity strength when lidocaine is used as a steroid 
diluent instead of saline for cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419].  
 
BACKGROUND : 
Literature:  
Cervical radicular pain is a common problem that is often treated by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_225169] (1). While clinical practice guidelines do not specifically recommend or 
discourage the use of local anesthetic in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_263094] (2), the majority of t he 
published literature on clinical outcomes of cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_263095] (3 -11). Consequently, many practitioners 
elect to use local anesthetic in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_263096]. Local anesthetic 
may also be used in such cases to gain additional clinical information regarding a 
patient’s analgesic response, which may help pi[INVESTIGATOR_263097] a precise anato mic source of 
pain when the clinical presentation and pain generator is not clear.  
 
Local anesthetic injection into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_263098]. High doses of local anesthetic in the cervical 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814] (12) and inappropriately placed low -dose local anesthetic in the subdural 
space or subarachnoid space (13,14) are known to cause motor weakness. 
Appropriately placed, low -dose local anesthetic injected into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_263099] a 
transforam inal approach, in close proximity to the exiting spi[INVESTIGATOR_263100], causes 
motor block in a small proportion of patients (15). However, the effect of low -dose 
injection of local anesthetic in the cervical interlaminar epi[INVESTIGATOR_263101]. 
This proposition affects post -procedure instructions, as even mild weakness may pose a 
hazard during performance manual activities that require the upper extremity/extremities 
such  as using a handrail or cane handle for support.   
 
Dynamometry is an established method for assessing muscle strength and motor 
neuron function with high reliability, and has been used to objectively assess changes in 
upper extremity strength and has been  validated in several patient populations (16 -22).

HRP-593 / v011017  This study aims to determine whether a standard dose of 2 mL 1% lidocaine vs 2mL of 
saline included as a steroid diluent in a C7 -T1 cervical interlaminar epi[INVESTIGATOR_225169] (CESI) causes an object ive change in strength as measured by [CONTACT_263125].  
 
We hypothesize that CESI with lidocaine will cause an objective transient decrease in 
upper extremity strength, consistent with the expected duration of this local anesthetic.  
 
Significance:  Cervical rad iculitis is a relatively common pain syndrome and is often 
treated with cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_86227] (CESI) when conservative treatments 
(oral analgesics, physical therapy and activity modification for example) have failed to 
provide relief of sympt oms. There are no universal clinical practice guidelines for the 
use of or type of diluents when CESI are performed.  
Interlaminar CESI may be performed with or without the use of local anesthetics. CESI 
without the benefit of local anesthetic as a steroid  diluent will not provide immediate 
relief of pain in patients with excruciating radicular symptoms, and also limits clinical 
information gleaned from the immediate analgesic response. Finally, the lack of 
immediate pain relief following spi[INVESTIGATOR_31500] s for chronic pain management may 
decrease patient satisfaction (23).  
 
By [CONTACT_263126] a diluent during interlaminar CESI, we 
will provide information about the potential for objective motor weakness with this 
commonly per formed pain management procedure.

STUDY -WIDE NUMBER OF  PARTICIPANTS : 
 Sample Size Calculation  
  
 Group 1: n = 60 (CESI with Lidocaine Diluent)  
 Group 2: n = 60 (CESI with Saline Diluent)  
  Group 3: n = 20 (no CESI, control group)  
 
A power analysis was performed based upon previous observations of changes in UE 
strength (24,25) using Fisher’s Exact Test. Sample sizes of 52 in each of the two 
treatment groups will achieve > 80% power to detect a group different in proportions, 
assuming 20% of patients in the Lidocaine group will demonstrate a motor deficit after 
the CESI and those in the Saline group will demonstrate no difference in motor strength 
after the CESI, and further  assuming a 2% measurement error with the strength testing 
method described.  The alpha level of this test statistic is set at 0.05, but the 
significance level actually achieved by [CONTACT_263128] 0.0004. To allow for drop 
outs, a total of 1 30 subjec ts will be enrolled in group 1 and 2. Group 3 will enroll a 
convenience sample of 20 control subjects based on available patients. Total of 1 50 
subjects for the study will be enrolled.  
 
Statistical analysis : The primary outcome (UE strength by [CONTACT_263129]’s Exact Test. 
Secondary outcomes will be compared using the Mann -Whitney test for continuous data

Protocol Date: October 26, 2022  Protocol Summary:  
 
Children with pneumonia presenting to the ED at Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496350]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496351]. During 
intervention periods, providers caring for enrolled children will be presented with a detailed decision 
support strategy that emphasizes management in accordance wit h national guideline recommendations. 
The anticipated study duration is 18 months for Phase  1 (P1)  and 24 months for Phase 2 (P2). As this 
study does not include direct contact [CONTACT_496398], there is no anticipated follow up.

2.[ADDRESS_638075] common serious infection in childhood. In the [LOCATION_002] (US), pneumonia 
accounts for 1 -4% of all emergency department (ED) visits in children (3- 28 per 1,000 US children per 
year)
1 and ranks among the top 3 reasons for pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] >100,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496352] (15- 22 per 100,000 US children per year)2-5. Pneumonia also accounts for more days of antibiotic use 
in US children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496353].6   
 Safely reduci ng inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to slow the progression of antimicrobial resistance, 
and childhood pneumonia is a key area where substantial improvements can be made. In the 2011 Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society  of America (PI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]/IDSA) pneumonia 
guideline, appropriate use of antibiotics was an important area of emphasis.
7 For presumed bacterial 
pneumonia, recommendations emphasize the use of a single, narrow -spectrum antibiotic (i.e. amoxicillin 
or ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]). In children <[ADDRESS_638076]- spectrum ant ibiotics was very common among children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_347861], with substantial differences in antibiotic selection patterns among the various hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].11 In 
that study, use of narrow -spectrum ampi[INVESTIGATOR_496354] (<5%). High rates of broad -spectrum antibiotic use 
were also noted in a study of children with pneumonia treated and released from US EDs, with <30% of 
children receiving narrow -spectrum  therapy.12 
 
Emergency care for childhood pneumonia, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285], varies widely across the nation. 
A study examining hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496355] 35 US chil dren’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5425] 2009 -12 showed marked 
differences in severity -adjusted pneumonia hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46174] s (median 31%; range 19 -69%)13. 
Extending these findings, Florin et al. detected great hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -level variation in the use of diagnostic tests 
Protocol Version #: 2.1   4 
Protocol Date: October 26, [ADDRESS_638077] common diagnostic 
tests was very wide with some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496356] <30% of children and others performing those same tests in >75% of children. We also demonstrated an association betwee n high test -
utilizing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496357].
11  
 Provider preferences and inaccurate risk perceptions contribute to differences in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]. Within the Intermountain Healthcare System in Utah, Dean et al. exposed large differences in admission 
rates (range 38 -79%) among 18 individual ED providers providing care for >2,000 adults with 
pneumonia.
15 Differences were not explained by [CONTACT_496399][INVESTIGATOR_496358]. In another multicenter study of 472 
adults with pneumonia at <4% risk of 30- day morta lity estimated using objective severity scores, 
providers overestimated the risk of mortality in 5% of outpatients (range across institutions 0- 12%) and 
41% of inpatients (range across institutions 36- 48%).[ADDRESS_638078] of 
children were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240443] 48 hours and nearly 10% less than [ADDRESS_638079] —earlier transfer for 
more intensive therapy may have improved outcomes for some of these children. New strategies to inform decision making are needed, and the combination of risk stratification using objec tive tools and clinical 
decision support in the ED setting are innovative and promising approaches to achieve this goal.  
 Phase 1 : To test the hypothesis that electronic antibiotic decision support increases guideline -concordant 
antibiotic use compared with usual care in the ED.  
 
The primary outcome is the proportion of children exclusively receiving guideline -concordant 1st line 
antibiotic therapy during the first 24 hours of care (Table 1). Secondary outcomes include exclusive use 
of concordant antibiotic therapy for the entire epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], any use of concordant antibiotic therapy during the 
first 24 hours of care and for the entire epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and ED revisits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52090] 72 hours and 
7 days of the index discharge.   
 
Phase 2 : To test the hypothesis that the delivery of severity information generated by [CONTACT_496400].  
 
Protocol Version #: 2.1   5 
Protocol Date: October 26, 2022  The primary outcome is appropriate site of care disposition (Table 2). Surveillance for su bsequent ED 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496359]. Secondary efficacy and safety 
outcomes include the overall site o f care disposition (ED discharge, ward, ICU), and ED revisits and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52090] 72 hours and 7 days of the index discharge.  
 
In these studies, conducted at two experienced academic centers, we will implement and evaluate an 
EHR -based clinical decision support application to promote antibiotic use in concordance with the 2011 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]/IDSA guideline in a pragmatic, cluster -randomized  trial ( P1). Next, we will incorporate risk 
stratification using a previously developed prognostic tool into a second EHR -based decision support 
application, testing its impact on site of care disposition compared to usual care in a pragmatic randomized trial ( P2). In both studies, a ll subjects will receive standard of care. Decisions regarding 
management, includin g antibiotic selection and site of care, will be at the discretion of the treating 
provider and will not be restricted or altered in any way. Thus, this study poses no greater than minimal risks to participants. Due to the nature of the research, we will seek a waiver of informed consent as has been done in similar pragmatic studies at our institutions.
17-[ADDRESS_638080] the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community 
(EPIC) Study, a prospective, population- based surveillance study of community- acquired pneumonia 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496360].2,22 We enrolled >[ADDRESS_638081] 
prospective study of pneumonia hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496361].  Over 70% of children 
enrolled in EPIC had a viral pathogen detected whereas bacterial pathogens were identified in only 15% 
of children. Nevertheless, nearly 90% of children received antibiotic s. In most cases, antibiotic treatment 
was discordant with the national guideline and broad- spectrum antibiotic use was common.[ADDRESS_638082] of the 2011 PI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]/IDSA guideline on antibiotic selection for children with 
pneumonia enrolled in EPIC, demonstrating only a modest reduction in the use of broad- spectrum 
antibiotics following publication of the guideline. Guideline -concordant use of narrow -spectrum 
aminopenicillins remained <20% by [CONTACT_2054], indicating a clear opportunity for further 
improvement.23  
 
We also  used data from the EPIC study to develop a prognostic tool for assessing pneumonia disease 
severity in children. Prognostic tools use statistical modeling to combine inputs, such as demographics, 
clinical variables, and results of diagnostic tests, to pro duce reliable and unbiased risk estimates for a 
specified outcome. For our prognostic tool, we focused on acute in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209], organized into an 
ordinal severity scale consisting of 3 levels: severe, moderate, and mild. Our modeling strategy, ordina l 
logistic regression, offers increased statistical power and precision compared to binary/multinomial logistic regression, and the resulting output allows one to simultaneously estimate probabilities for each 
level on the outcome scale or in combination ( e.g., probability of moderate to severe and probability of 
severe outcomes). Predictor variables for our prognostic tool were selected a priori and also informed by [CONTACT_496401]. We focused on objectively defined variables with strong hypothesized associations with the outcome that could be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_496362] #: 2.1   6 
Protocol Date: October 26, 2022  clinical setting. This process resulted in a pool of 20 predictors . We also created a separate, more 
parsimonious model restricted to 9 predictors commonly available within electronic health records 
(EHR).  
 Both models accurately identified risk for moderate or severe pneumonia, indicating strong potential to 
improve risk stratification . Model discrimination, which measures the degree of concordance b etween 
observed and predicted outcomes, was excellent with a c- index ranging from 0.78- 0.81. Differences in 
model fit and quality were considered negligible, and results from the internal bootstrap validation were 
comparable to the primary models. In the f ull model, PaO
2:FiO 2 ratio (PF ratio, estimated from the 
SaO 2FiO 2 ratio),[ADDRESS_638083] predictors, contributing 96% of the explainable outcome variation. The EHR model retained most of these predictors (omitting altered mental 
status, chest indrawing, and infiltrate pattern). Nonetheless, predictive performance of the EHR model 
equaled that of the full model. For the full  model, the median predicted risk for moderate or severe 
pneumonia was 18% (IQR 9- 32%) and for severe pneumonia 5% (3- 11%).  
 
Prognostic tools used in adults with pneumonia improve risk stratification and clinical decision making, 
but these tools are underutilized, indicating a need for improved implementation strategies. A number of prognostic tools have been developed t o assist providers caring for adults with pneumonia,
25-[ADDRESS_638084] 30 -day mo rtality. Newer tools (e.g., SMART -COP and SCAP)26,[ADDRESS_638085] been used to safely increas e the number of low -risk patients treated in the outpatient setting 
and improve guideline -concordant antibiotic management.43-47 As a result, their use in the management of 
adults with pneumonia in outpatient and inpatient settings i s strongly recommended.25 Nonetheless, 
several studies indicate these tools are often applied incorrectly or not used at all.15,48- 50 Major barriers to 
clinical use include tool complexity (inability to recall parameters and inaccurate scoring or 
interp retation) and disruptions to provider workflow (suspension of patient care to calculate risk by [CONTACT_496402]).[ADDRESS_638086] from unnecessary or unproven practices. The 
availability of comprehensive EHRs has allowed for the development of increasingl y complex decision 
support applications, including risk stratification using real -time electronic capture of patient 
demographics, physiologic data, and diagnostic testing results.
17,52 In a randomized trial conducted in 
primary care settings comparing decision support integrated with 2 prognostic tools vs. usual care without 
decision support, McGinn and colleagues showed a 25% reduction in antibiotic use overall and a 50% reduction in broad- spectrum antibioti c use in adults with possible bacterial pharyngitis or pneumonia 
when using the decision support application.
52 The application was triggered on chief complaint and 
incorporated a risk calculator, which used automated and user -supplied inputs to identify risk for bacterial

decision support and research purposes. As an example of such capabilities, in the EPIC study, a decision support tool used in adul ts with pneumonia was adapted for use as a screening tool.
17 The tool used 
natural language processing to identify concepts suggestive of pneumonia in radiology “wet” reads in 
real-time and required a provider -confirmation of a pneumonia diagnosis . For EPIC, we adapted this tool 
to deliver electronic alerts to our e nrollment teams. Importantly, a similar tool was used to identify 
pneumonia in the study by [CONTACT_496403]. described in the preceding paragraph. A second example highly 
relevant to this proposal was developed by [CONTACT_349493]- investigator, [CONTACT_496411], and involves  antibiotic 
decision support to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics in critically ill neonates. Importantly, the 
algorithm was followed in >70% of infants and led to significant reductions in antibiotic exposure.53  
Additionally, our co- investigators, Drs. Weinger and Slagle, experts in human factors engineering and 
user-interface design of health information technology, possess extensive experience designing and 
evaluating decision support applications that maximize utility and minimize potential for human error.54-63 
These examples highlight that the investigators at Vanderbilt and the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_496363], expertise, and institutional resources to develop and implement effective decision 
support applications.  
 
4.0 Study Design and Randomization  
 
4.1 Study Design and Randomization ( P1, EHR -based antibiotic decision support)  
Effectiveness of the EHR -based antibiotic decision support application for promoting guideline -
concordant antibiotic prescribing in children presenting for emergency care will be evaluated in a 
pragmatic, cluster -randomized study conducted over a period of 18 months t hat includes two respi[INVESTIGATOR_496364]. Our institutions possess demonstrated experience in the execution of these pragmatic designs. 17-
21 Assignments to control or intervention arms will occur in 4- week periods using a randomly determined 
sequence within each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. To ensure balanced representation of each arm in periods of both low and 
high pneumonia prevalence, randomization will occur in 3 permuted blocks (size=6).  The antibiotic 
decision support application will be provided to those randomized to the intervention arm, whereas the 
control arm will receive usual care. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of treating providers will not be possible. Importantly, since this is a trial focused on provider behavior, all children will 
receiv e standard of care management. All treatment decisions will be made by [CONTACT_496404].  
 
4.2 Study Design and Randomization ( P2, EHR -based risk stratification )  
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing our prognostic tool (intervention arm) to usual 
care (control arm) over a period of 24 months. Randomization will occur at the patient level. Allocation to 
Protocol Version #: 2.1   8 
Protocol Date: October 26, [ADDRESS_638088] number (even vs. odd) or similar strategy and will 
be assigned automatically once a provider confirms the diagnosis of pneumonia. Importantly, all standard 
of care treatment options will be available and decision -making will not be restricted in any way in either 
group. A similar randomized trial that predicts readmission risk among all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496365]. In that study, every adult admitted to Vanderbilt University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496366] (under  waiver of consent). Readmission risk is calculated automatically for all 
patients, but only displayed for a random half to determine if providing this additional information 
improves outcomes compared to usual care.  
 
5.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Phases  1 and 2)  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Six months to <18 years of age  
2. Radiographic evidence of pneumonia in ED  
3. Provider -confirmed diagnosis of pneumonia  
 
Exclusion Criteria
 (Provider query and/or automated data abstraction ) 
1. Children with tracheostomy, cystic fibrosis, immunosuppression  
2. Inter -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788]  
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496367] 7 days  
4. Previously enrolled within preceding 28 days  
5. Provider preference for any reason  
 6.0 Screening and Enrollment  
 
6.1 Screening and Enrollment ( P1) 
Children with pneumonia presenting to the ED at Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496368]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496369]. The pneumonia radiology alert tool will be used to identify potentially eligible children in a systematic and efficient manner using natural language processing (NLP) . Those who screen positive according to the radiology NLP algorithm  will 
trigger a Best Practice Alert (BPA)  or similar within the EHR which queries the provider to con firm the 
diagnosis of pneumonia and assesses for study inclusion/exclusion criteria. In instances where a chest radiograph is not captured via the NLP algorithm (e.g. a radiograph obtained at an outside facility), an alternative pathway is available to tri gger the subsequent BPAs leading to enrollment. Due to the nature 
of the research, we will seek a waiver of informed consent as has been done in similar pragmatic studies 
at our institutions.
17-21 Thus, a t this point, el igible children will be considered enrolled. During 
intervention periods, providers caring for enrolled children will be presented with a detailed decision 
support strategy that emphasizes management in accordance with national guideline recommendations. 
During control periods, no additional decision support will be provided.   
 6.2 Screening and Enrollment  (P2) 
Screening and enrollment procedures for P2  will be identical to P1. For children randomized to the 
intervention arm, providers will be presented with prognostic information regarding risk for severe disease outcomes via an EHR -based decision support strategy that emphasizes management in accordance 
Protocol Version #: 2.1  9 
Protocol Date: October 26, 2022  with national guidelin e recommendations. During control periods, no additional decision support will be 
provided.   
 
7.0 Study Procedures  
 
7.1 EHR -based Antibiotic Decision Support (P1 ) 
For enrolled subjects assigned to the decision support arm, providers will receive antibiotic 
recomm endations in accordance with the 2011 PI[INVESTIGATOR_16852]/IDSA guideline , tailored to site of care and illness 
severity . For instance, in young children with mild illness being discharged from the ED, the support tool 
will offer guidance regarding when a strategy of watchful waiting might be favored over empi[INVESTIGATOR_496370] (e.g., fully immunized toddler with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_135275]). Similarly, in those being admitted to a general ward, the tool will advise consideration of oral therapy in children with good 
oral intake, or when to consider adjunctive therapy with a macrolide or anti- staphylococcal antibiotic. 
Importantly, the tool will offer treatment recommendations only and will not proscribe a specific 
treatment plan. If a provider chooses to prescribe therapy not in accordance with the national guideline, the tool will query providers regarding reasons for discrepant prescribing for later analysis.   
 7.2 Outcomes ( P1) 
The primary outcome is the proportion of children exclusively receiving guideline-concordant 1st 
line antibiotic therapy during the 
first 24 hours of care (Table 1) . For 
patients discharged from the ED, this will include antibiotics received in the ED as w ell as antibiotic 
prescriptions provided at discharge. For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], this will include therapy received during the first [ADDRESS_638089] 24 hours of care 
and for the entire epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], and changes in antibiotics after 72 hours, and death, and for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496371], delayed ICU transfer, defined as >24 hours following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   7.3 Data Collection/Management ( P1) 
Data collection will be triggered by [CONTACT_496405]. Prior to study initiation, support analysts will conduct detailed requirement explorations to identify necessary data elements and associated data flows, validate accuracy, and evaluate for missing data. Data to be collected includes decision support usage statistics, visit details (e.g., admission and discharge date and time, site of care, ED revisits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394]), patient Table 1.

route, and duration), laboratory testing and results, radiologic studies, and data elements from the decision support applications.  
 
7.4 EHR -based Prognostic Decision Support ( P2) 
For enrolled subjects assigned to the decision support arm, providers will receive prognostic information derived using our previously validated and best performing model.  The decision support application will 
automatically calculate predicted risk for moderate (intensive care) and severe (respi[INVESTIGATOR_496373]) outcomes using the parameters derived from the prognostic tool’s regression equation. Outcome probabilities will be integrated into the decision support application and displayed within the EHR. The support application will also report any objective criteria necessitating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (e.g., hypoxia) or potential intensive care (e.g., hypotension, SpO
2<92% despi[INVESTIGATOR_496374] 2≥ 50%) to further inform site of care 
decisions. The application will also query providers regarding factors influencing site of care decisions to inform analyses describing discrepancies between risk assessments and decision -making (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496375]) and provider variation in risk tolerance. Importantly, the tool will offer prognostic 
information only and will 
not proscribe a specific site of care or management plan. All site of care decisions will 
remain at the discretion of 
the treating provider.  
 7.5 Outcomes  (P2) 
The primary outcome is appropriate site of care disposition  (Table 2) . Surveillance for subsequent ED 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496376]. To adjudicate the appropriateness of brief h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_496377] (<24 hours), an investigator in both Nashville and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_496378], blinded to intervention assignment.  
 Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes  include the  overall site of care disposition (ED discharge, ward, 
ICU), and ED revisits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52090] 72 hours and 7 days of the index discharge.  Exploratory outcomes include death, and for those hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496379], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. 
 
7.6 Data Collection/Management ( P2) 
See Section 7.3  
8.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
8.1 Power and Sample Size  (P1) 
Based on ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496380], we anticipate nearly [ADDRESS_638091] of Table 2. Appropriate Site of Care Definitions  
Disposition  Appropriate if:  
Home care  No subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 24h  
Inpatient, ward  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] ≥ 24h; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] < 24h but

oxygen); and no subsequent transfer to ICU within 24h

Protocol Version #: 2.1   11 
Protocol Date: October 26, 2022  these studies. Assuming conservatively that data for 750 children are enrolled in each arm, and 30% 
guideline -concordant antibiotic use in the usual care arm (based on our prior study of antibiotic use in the 
EPIC cohor t)23, we will be able to detect an absolute difference of ≥6.8% in guideline -concordant  
prescribing at an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power. Effective sample size may be reduced due to the 
cluster randomized nature of the study (a conservative estimate for effective sample size would be around 500 children in each arm).  
 8.2 Analysis  (P1) 
Analy zing data from cluster randomized trials requires accounting for correlations within clusters and 
time periods. As outlined by [CONTACT_75882].,
21 we will use a hierarchical and mixed effects logistic 
regression model , a complex analytic a pproach which offers  flexibility regarding model assumptions and 
incorporation of cluster -level and individual- level covariates. We will also use a weighted, cluster -level 
logistic regression to compare guideline- concordant antibiotic prescribing between groups. In this 
analysis, data for each cluster are collapsed into a single summary measure, and the summary measures are then analyzed as if they were raw data, facilitating simple data reporting and interpretation. 
21Important baseline covariates (e.g., ag e, sex, race, site of care, frequency of bacteremia and other 
pneumonia -related complications) will also be assessed and included as model covariates. Similar 
analyses will be conducted for the proposed secondary and exploratory outcomes using hierarchical  and 
mixed effects logistic regression models for binary  outcomes and frailty models  for time to first antibiotic .  
 An important consideration in our analysis is the possibility of contamination effects in the usual care arm 
related to changes in provider behavior due to past exposures and awareness of the intervention. Such 
contamination would be expected to bias towar d the null hypothesis. We posit that such effects will be of 
minor concern since 1) guideline -concordant prescribing at our institutions remains low despi[INVESTIGATOR_496381]; 2) th e ED is a 
busy environment with many providers (e.g., 40+ ED faculty plus mid- level providers and 
fellows/residents at Vanderbilt alone), such that repeated exposure to the intervention by [CONTACT_496406], particularly early during the  study period and during times of low pneumonia 
prevalence; and 3) resident physicians, the providers responsible for the majority of order entry and thus directly exposed to the intervention, rotate on a monthly schedule and only work in the ED once each year. We have designed our monthly randomization periods around these important considerations. 
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the potential for contamination, and we will formally evaluate for such 
effects in a secondary analysis by [CONTACT_496407] -concordant prescribing 
in each arm over the duration of the study period. We will then compare prescribing trends in both arms with a historical trend estimated from monthly proportions of guideline -concordant prescribing in the year 
prior to study initiation. By [CONTACT_496408], we will estimate both the degree of potential contamination as well as the independent impact of the intervention.  
 8.3 Potential Limitations and Alternative Appro aches ( P1) 
We do not anticipate major difficulties designing or implementing our antibiotic decision support application. If challenges arise, our experienced team possesses the necessary expertise, past experience, and institutional resources to address and overcome them. Design challenges will be addressed by [CONTACT_496409]. Alternative analytic approaches were considered, including quasi -expe rimental 
Protocol Version #: 2.1  12 
Protocol Date: October 26, [ADDRESS_638092] to temporal bias (compared to the step wedge approach) and minimizes problems with contamination in the usual care arm ( compared to provider or patient- level randomization) as 
outlined above. In addition to the analyses outlined above, if we fail to demonstrate meaningful outcome differences between the two arms, we will conduct exploratory analyses to elucidate reasons for  lack of 
intervention effectiveness.  
8.4 Power and Sample Size (P2 ) 
As outlined in P1 , we anticipate nearly [ADDRESS_638093] of these studies. Assuming conservatively that data for 2000 children (1000 in each arm) are 
captured during the two-year study period, and 90% appropriate site of care disposition in the usual care 
arm (based on data from the EPIC cohort)
23, we will be able to detect an absolute difference of ≥3.4% in 
appropriate care disposition at an alpha level of 0.05 with 80% power. 
 8.5 Analysis ( P2) 
Logistic regression models will be performed to compare appropriate site of care disposition between the 
two study arms, controlling for important baseline covariates (e.g., age, season, provider type) to maximize power. Robust standard errors will be calculated to account for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496382]. We 
will also perform analyses to assess for interactions between two study arms and predicted risk for severe 
outcomes, age, provider type, and initial site of care, to identify subgroups in whom decision support may 
be most useful. Similar  analyses will be conducted for the proposed secondary and exploratory outcomes 
along with cox regression model for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496383].  8.6 Potential Limitations and Alternative Approaches (P2 ) 
In contrast to our studies of antibiotic decision support, we chose to randomize at the individual level rather than monthly periods since potential for contamination effects is minimal (i.e. risk estimates are 
unique to each individual’s set of circumstances and linked to a complex algebraic equation). Alt hough 
we hypothesize that supplying providers with objective prognostic information will improve care 
decisions, this information could lead to unintended outcomes, such as increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496384]. This would be an important finding in itself, as it contrasts with prior studies in adults highlighting the usefulness of adult pneumonia severity tools, and provides valuable data regarding how risk information is interpreted and applied.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_638094] by [CONTACT_1758]. This study does not involve an investigational intervention given or 
administered directly to patients (i.e. no treatment assignments will be made). Therefore, this study poses 
no greater than minimal risk to study participants. Vanderbilt is at the forefront of these pragmat ic, 
minimal risk clinical trial designs, and our study team benefits greatly from the experiences and expertise of our colleagues who have completed similar studies under waiver of informed consent. The potential 
benefit of this study would come through mo re effective therapy.  
 
Protocol Version #: 2.1   13 
Protocol Date: October 26, [ADDRESS_638095] (DSMB) due  to the inclusion of children and the multi -
center nature of the study. The DSMB is comprised of  three individuals with expertise relevant to the 
study, including biostatistics, and prior experience serving in this capacity. The DSMB will be independent of  the study team and will conduct formal data and safety evaluations at least every six 
months. During these meetings, the DSMB will assess study progress, including subject accrual and 
retention, data quality, and subject safety in a confidential manner. T he DSMB will make 
recommendations regarding whether the study should continue unchanged or  require 
modification/amendment . Based on the findings of the data and safety monitor’s reports, the PI, 
associated IRBs, and any other appropriate funding or regulat ory agencies have the authority to stop or 
suspend the study or require modifications.  
 
10.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Privacy and confidentiality is  of the highest priority, and all efforts will be made to keep personal 
information and research records private throughout these studies.  Records and documents pertaining to 
the conduct of this study will be kept in HIPPA -compliant, secure, password prot ected databases or in 
locked files accessible only by a limited number of study personnel. All patient data will be coded using a 
unique study ID. No PHI will be shared outside of the key study personnel at each institution and no PHI 
will be shared betwee n institutions. The information from the research study may be published using 
aggregate results; however, no individual subject will be identified.  
 11.[ADDRESS_638096] through regular study meetings. Annual reports will be 
submitted to the responsible IRBs summarizing study progress, adverse events, complaints about the 
research or withdrawals, and any protocol violations.  
 12.0 Study Wi thdrawal/Discontinuation  
Protocol Version #: 2.1   14 
Protocol Date: October 26, [ADDRESS_638097] if it is judged to be in the participant’s best interest, 
or if the subject no longer meets eligibility criteria (see Section 5. 0). Due to the observational nature of 
the study, t here are no formal interim analyses or planned halting criteria.  
 13.[ADDRESS_638098] with enrolled subjects, there is no anticipated follow up. Records will be maintained in accordance with IRB, institutional, and sponsor policies.

Study Design  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], multicenter, open -label, single -arm trial will evaluate the anti -tumor activity of zanidatamab  
monotherapy in subjects with HER2 -amplified, inoperable and advanced or metastatic BTC, including intra -
hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), extra -hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), and gallbladder cancer (GBC). 
Subjects must have received at least [ADDRESS_929563] recent prior therapy.  
New or archival tumor tissue is required from all subjects for HER2 amplification and HER2 protein expression 
testing at a central lab using in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Subjects may 
be tested for HER2 status at the central lab any time after diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease and 
before study enrollment. Subjects who elect to be pre -screened for HER2 status must sign a separate informed 
consent for collection, storage, and analys is of the tumor tissue. Once a prospective subject experiences disease 

Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland , Limited    08SEP2023  
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 4 of 97  
 
 Confidential    progression or develops intolerance to his/her most recent prior therapy, the main consent for the remaining 
screening assessments must be signed.  
Two cohorts of subjects will be enroll ed: 
• Cohort 1, comprising subjects with HER2 amplification by [CONTACT_685829]2 overexpression by [CONTACT_4658]; 
i.e., IHC 2+ or  3+ 
• Cohort 2, comprising subjects with HER2 amplification by [CONTACT_685829]2 IHC 0 or  1+ 
Enrolled subjects will receive zanidatamab , 20 mg/kg given  intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W) until [ADDRESS_929564] 1.1 will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_89169]. Disease response will be evaluated every 8 weeks (Q8W) using computed tomograph y (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  
Number of Planned Subjects  
Cohort 1: approximately 75 subjects.  
Cohort 2: approximately [ADDRESS_929565] to review in the event of a Good Clinical Practice (GCP) audit 
and/or health regulatory authority inspection.  
Inclusion Criteria

N/A.  
Required Premedication  
All subjects must receive mandatory prophylactic treatment for potential infusion reactions 30 to 60 minutes 
before the start of each zanidatamab  infusion. Pretreatment should include corticosteroids, antihistamines, and 
acetaminophen at the following reco mmended doses:  
● Corticosteroids - either hydrocortisone 100 mg IV or dexamethasone 10 mg  IV 
● Antihistamines - diphenhydramine 50 mg per oral (PO) or  IV 
● Acetaminophen - [ADDRESS_929581] seek sponsor 
approval. Sponsor approval is required before implementation.  
For subjects who experience an infusion reaction despi[INVESTIGATOR_137397], other medication(s) as 
needed per the investigator or per institutional standards  including histamine -2 receptor antagonists (H2 
blockers) may be given in addition to the mandatory premedication.  
Duration of Treatment  
Subjects may continue on treatment with zanidatamab  until investigator -determined radiographic disease 
progression per RECIST 1.1, unequivocal clinical progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, 
physician decision, pregnancy, start of a subsequent anticancer therapy, or study termination by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor. 
Unequivocal clinical progression is defined as worsening or re -emergence of pre -existing symptoms relating to 
underlying cancers (e.g., increase in disease -related pain), or emergence of new symptoms that cannot be 
attributed to study drug toxic ities or alternative causes. A marked deterioration in ECOG performance status 
may also indicate unequivocal clinical progression. Every effort should be made to confirm disease progression 
radiographically. Only in instances where subjects appear to have unequivocal clinical progression and it is not 
possible or feasible for the subject to undergo radiologic assessment should investigators remove the subject 
from study treatment. Subjects who discontinue treatment with zanidatamab  for any reason should ent er the 30 -
day safety  follow -up period, and will continue with efficacy follow -up (if treatment discontinuation was due to 
reasons other than progressive disease or start of subsequent anticancer therapy ) as well as survival follow -up. 
Efficacy Assessments  
CT and/or MRI scans will be performed at baseline and Q8W during treatment (timed from Cycle 1 Day 1)  and 
will continue  after treatment discontinuation  every [ADDRESS_929582] 1.1 by [CONTACT_89169] (primary endpoint) and 
investigator (secondary endpoint); responses are to be confirmed 4 weeks following initial documentation of 
objective response by [CONTACT_093].  
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assess ments  
Blood samples will be collected at protocol -specified timepoints for evaluation of serum concentrations 
(PK) of zanidatamab  and for evaluation of ADA (immunogenicity).  
Serum concentrations of zanidatamab  will be measured as a function of time post -dosing. PK parameters to be 
estimated include the following: 1) for single (first) dose: maximum concentration (C max), time to maximum 
concentration (tmax), area under the serum concentration -time curve from zero to the last measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t), terminal elimination rate constant (λ z), half -life (t 1/2), area under the serum 
concentration -time curve from zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), serum clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V d), etc. 
and 2) for multiple doses: area under the serum concentration -time curve from zero to the end of dosing interval 
(AUC tau), average concentration (C ave) for Dose 1, C max and minimum concentration (C min) (trough) for 
subsequent doses, accumulation index, fluctuation ratio, steady state concentration (C ss), and attainm ent of steady 
state. ADAs to zanidatamab  and possibly neutralizing antibodies will be measured, including frequency, time of 
onset, and duration of immunogenicity response.  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland , Limited    08SEP2023  
ZWI -ZW25 -[ADDRESS_929583] 30 subjects  (the first [ADDRESS_929584] of 
world ) will be assigned to an extensive PK schedule  (suitability determined by [CONTACT_7195]) . Further 
subjects will then be assigned to the sparse PK schedule (peak -trough measurements only).  Thirty  subjects  (the 
first [ADDRESS_929585] of the world who 
reach Cycle 4 , with suitability determined by [CONTACT_7195] ) will also be assigned to an extensive PK 
schedule for 1 cycle at stea dy state (Cycle 4 or later).  
Biomarker Assessments  
Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected at the specified timepoints for assessment of biomarkers. 
Biomarkers may include but are not limited to circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), tumor tissue DNA and RNA, 
HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) , carbohydrate antigen 19 -9 (CA19 -9), and post -treatment HER2 tumor 
status . Biomarkers will be investigated as an exploratory endpoint and will not be used to guide subject 
selection for the study.  Only the biomarkers sp ecified above will be tested on samples collected in Mainland 
China.  
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_44994], frequency, and severity of AEs, including the following:  
● Adverse events of special interest (AESIs): infusion -related  reactions,  non-infectious pulmonary 
toxicities, and cardiac events of  absolute decrease  in LVEF  of ≥ 10 percentage points from 
pretreatment baseline  and absolute value <  50%, and /or grade ≥  2 heart  failure  
● SAEs and  deaths  
The following safety parameters will  also be assessed:  
● Clinical laboratory values (including hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and  urinalysis)  
● Physical  examination  
● Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and  temperature)  
● ECOG  PS 
● Concomitant medications, including  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  
● Electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  
Cardiac function will be monitored via echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans. The same 
modality (echocardiogram or MUGA scan) must be used throughout the study period. AEs will be collected 
from Cycle [ADDRESS_929586] dose of study drug. Study protocol -related SAEs will be 
collected from the time of si gning the pre-screening or main informed consent for the study. Investigators 
should follow subjects with AEs until the event returns to baseline, stabilizes (recovering/resolving) or is no 
longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], or the subject dies, is lost to follow -up, or withdraws 
consent, or study closure.  
Safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_82571] 
(IDMC). Th e committee is tasked with monitoring the safety of participants in this study through regular and/or 
ad hoc meetings . An IDMC meeting will be held after the first [ADDRESS_929587] enrolled in China  has received 1 dose of zanidatamab  to review  safety . The IDMC will be 
responsible for making recommendations to the sponsor as to appropriate study direction; further details will be 
provided in the IDMC charter.  
Quality  of Life and Disease -Related Pain Assessments  
The EQ -5D-5L questionnaire will be used to obtain QOL information and the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_685786] -related pain at protocol -specified timepoints.

With a sample size of 100 subjects (Cohorts 1 and 2 combined), the binomial probabilities of detecting 1 or 
more treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with a frequency of 5%, 1%, and 0.1% are approximately 
0.99, 0.63,  and 0.10, respectively.  
Summaries of subject disposition, demographics, disease characteristics, and exposure will be provided. Safety 
and efficacy endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. In 
addition, the PK parameters of zanidatamab  will be estimated and summarized with descriptive statistics.

t1/[ADDRESS_929615] cancers (BTCs), including gallbladder cancer (GBC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) 
(both intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ICC] and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ECC]), are 
poor prognosis cancers that account for approximately 3% of all adult c ancers (Valle 2017 ). 
BTCs represent a heterogeneous group of diseases that are associated with distinct risk factors, 
molecular characteristics, and symptoms at presentation. For example, the liver fluke Opi[INVESTIGATOR_685791] i infection is a risk factor for ICC and ECC but not GBC, while patients with GBC are 
less likely to present with jaundice compared to patients with ICC or ECC (Valle 2017 ). 
Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH 1/2) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 
(FGFR2) are more prevalent in patients with ICC ( Valle 2017 ); (Arai 2014 ). Recent studies with 
small molecule inhibitors of IDH1 or FGFR2 have demonstrat ed clinical activity in patients with 
advanced CC containing these respective gene mutations (A. Vogel 2019, Abou -Alfa 2019 ). 
Human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) amplification, which is more frequent in 
GBC, repr esents another potential molecular treatment target (Valle 2017 ). 
The incidence and mortality rates of BTCs are increasing, mostly due to a rise in the incidence of 
ICC. More than 65% of patients with BTC are diagnosed with non -resectable disease and the 
relapse rate is high among patients who undergo potentially curativ e surgery. The 5 -year survival 
rate is approximately 5 to 15% for all patients; the estimated 5 -year survival rate varies by [CONTACT_685832]: 50% for American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage I, 30% for Stage II, 
10% for Stage III, and 0% for Stage IV (Valle  2017 ). 
1.2. Standard of Care Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_685792] - and platinum -
containing regimens (Tsav aris 2004,  Eckel 2007 ). In a randomized, multicenter,  
Phase 3 trial of 410 subjects (the ABC -02 Study), cisplatin combined with gemcitabine 
(CisGem) was associated with superior overall survival (OS) and progression -free sur vival (PFS) 
compared to gemcitabine alone in the first -line setting of advanced or metastatic BTC (Valle  
2010 ). These results were replicated in a randomized Phase 2 trial conducted in Japan ( the BT22 
Study) (Okusaka 2010 ). Based on these results, CisGem has become the recognized standard 
regimen for first -line treatment of patients with advanced BTC. In the second -line setting, the 
most robust data comes from a recent Phase 3 trial (the ABC -06 Study), in which 162 subjects 
were randomized 1:1 to receive either mFOLFOX (folinic acid [leucovorin], 5 -fluorouracil [5 - 
FU], and oxaliplatin) plus active symptom control (ASC), versus ASC alone. The median OS for 
subject s treated with mFOLFOX plus ASC was 6.2 months versus 5.3 months for subjects who 
received ASC alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.97, p = 0.031). The PFS and 
objective response rate (ORR) with mFOLFOX + ASC was 4 months and 5%, respectively; th e 
PFS and ORR with ASC alone was not reported (Lamarca 2019 ). Other than the ABC -[ADDRESS_929616] entered clinical development with 
encouraging results, including HER2 -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Pemigatinib (PEMAZYRE ™), a small 
molecule kinase inhibitor, was recently approved  for the treatment of patients with previously 
treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a FGFR2 fusion o r 
other rearrangement.  
1.3. HER2 Expression in  BTC  
HER2 is a member of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR/ErbB) family comprising 
4 structurally related receptors: HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and HER4. HER receptors are 
normally activated by [CONTACT_685833], resulting in a conformational change that 
allows formation of receptor homodimers and heterodimers. Receptor dimerization triggers 
autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues and activation of intracellular signaling 
pathways. Over -expression and amplification drive tumorigenesis through the creation of  
spontaneous receptor homodimers or heterodimers with other ErbB family members, resulting in 
activated oncogenic downstream signaling such as phosphoinositide 3 -kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT/mammal ian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen -activated protein kinase 
(MAPK), which in turn promote cellular proliferation, survival and angiogenesis (Moasser  
2007 ). HER2 is a well -described pre dictive biomarker for anti -HER2 therapy in breast and 
gastric cancer (Slamon 2001,  Bang 2010 ) and many other solid tumors also harbor HER2 gene 
amplification or over -expression (Meric -Bernstam 2019 ). However, data from published series 
of HER2 expression across solid tumors vary both in terms of methodology and reporting, and 
their utility is consequently  limited.  
A systematic literature review and meta -analysis of published data in BTC showed that among 
38 studies (a total of 3839 patients) that reported HER2 positivity assessed by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC), the mean prevalence of HER2 overexpression was 26.5% (95% 
CI: 18.9, 34.1%) (Galdy 2017 ). There was no statistically significant difference in HER2 
overexpression between regions; the mean prevalence of HER2 overexpression in Asia was 
28.4% (95% CI: 14.5, 42.3%) versus 19.7% (95% CI: 10.1, 29.2%) for Western countries,  
P value =  0.49. When all 38 studies were considered, no differences in the mean prevalence of 
HER2 overexpression were found between BTC tumor subtypes. However, when only studies 
that defined HER2 overexpression as the presence of moderate/strong staining were con sidered, 
the mean prevalence of HER2 overexpression was highest for GBC (19.1%), followed by [CONTACT_685834] 
(17.4%), and ICC (4.8%). HER2 amplification analysis was performed in 16  of the 38 studies 
and showed a mean prevalence of 30.1%. The mean prevalence of HER2 a mplification for ECC 
was 22.5% and 17.6 % for ICC; the prevalence was not reported for GBC (not all of the  16 
studies reported the prevalence of HER2 amplification by [CONTACT_685835]). A separate study of 
221 patients with BTC showed good correlation between H ER2 overexpression and gene 
amplification (78% concordance rate) (Nakazawa 2005 ). 
Similar to breast and gastric cancers, a number of studies have suggested that HER2 
overexpression or gene amplification has biologic importan ce or clinical relevance in BTCs. 
Constitutive expression of HER2 in gallbladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_685793] (Kiguchi 2001 ) and high HER2 expression in a 
cholangiocarcinoma cell lin e resulted in enhanced invasiveness, motility, and proliferation via 
AKT/p70S6K pathway activation, compared with cell lines without HER2 overexpression 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 26 of 97 
Confidential   (Treekitkarnmongkol 2010 ). Furthermore, in a HER2 -amplified GBC cell li ne, SNU -2670,  
trastuzumab demonstrated anti -tumor effects as monotherapy and in combination with 
gemcitabine, promoting increased apoptosis compared to cell lines without HER2 amplification 
(Nam 2016 ). 
1.4. Approved HER2 -Targeted  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44943]2 -targeted therapy into the clinic has led to marked improvements in 
disease -free survival, PFS, and OS for patients with HER2 -high breast cancer (Schramm 2015 ). 
In the [LOCATION_002] (US), t here are multiple approved HER2 -targeted agents, all of which are 
indicated for the treatment of HER2 -high breast cancer. These include the antibody -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44944] (HERCEPTIN® and biosimilars) , pertuzumab (PERJETA®), and 
margetuximab (MARGENZA ™), the antibody -drug conjugates (ADCs) ado -trastuzumab 
emantasine (KADCYLA®; also referred to as T -DM1) and fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki 
(ENHERTU®; also referred to as DS -8201a); the oral small molecule dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor 
lapatinib (TYKERB®); the  irreversible oral small molecule EGFR/HER2/HER4 inhibitor 
neratinib (NERLYNX®); and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tucatinib (T[LOCATION_006]YSA ™). Trastuzumab 
is also approved for advanced HER2 -overexpressing gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer. 
There are no app roved HER2 agents for any other HER2 -high expressing cancers, or for cancers 
with lower levels of HER2 expression and absence of gene  amplification.  
1.5. HER2 -targeted Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_685794]2 -targeted agents, lapatinib has been evaluated in both the first - and second -line 
setting in an unselected population of subjects with advanced BTC (Ramanathan 2009, 
Peck  2012 ). Res ults of these studies were unremarkable and showed no significant evidence of  
anti-tumor activity. However, in a separate case series of 9 GBC and 5 CC subjects treated with 
trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab monotherapy, 4/9 GBC subjects (44.4%) had pa rtial 
responses (PR) and 1/[ADDRESS_929617] (11.1%) had a complete response (CR), equating to an ORR 
of 55.6% (Javle 2015 ). An additional 3 GBC subjects had stable disease (SD). The duration of 
response (DOR) ranged from 8+ to 168 weeks (median 40 weeks). All [ADDRESS_929618] patients for HER2 -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
1.6. Zanidatamab  
Zanidatamab (formerly referred to as ZW25 ) is a novel humanized, bispecific antibody that binds 
to the same 2 extracellular domains of HER2 as trastuzumab (ECD4) and pertuzumab (E CD2). 
Binding of zanidatamab  results in blockade of ligand -dependent and independent growth and 
potent activation of antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The unique binding 
geometry of zanidatamab  also leads to increased tumor cell binding, rec eptor clustering, and 
receptor internalization relative to trastuzumab, including in settings of lower HER2 expression.  
A brief summary of zanidatamab  nonclinical and clinical data is provided below; additional data 
are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure. Planned and ongoing clinical studies are also 
summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure.

Confidential   In preclinical studies in tumor cell lines and xenograf t tumor models, zanidatamab  demonstrated 
anti-tumor activity that was superior to trastuzumab across a range of tumors and HER2 
expression levels. Zanidatamab  treatment of mice bearing HER2 1+ patient -derived breast cancer 
xenografts (ST1337B) significantl y improved host survival compared with trastuzumab or 
human immunoglobulin (hIgG). Zanidatamab  was also efficacious in nude mice bearing 
established tumors with a human non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cel l lines (A549 and FaDu cell lines, both HER2 < 3+, 
respectively). In  addition, zanidatamab  was efficacious in nude mice bearing established tumors 
with the human SKOV - 3 ovarian epi[INVESTIGATOR_685795] a 3+ level of 
HER2 expression.  
An ongoing first -in-human study of zanidatamab , a multi -part Phase 1 trial (ZWI -ZW25 -101; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and potential 
anti-tumor activity of zanidatamab  as a single agent and in combination wit h selected 
chemotherapy agents in subjects with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic 
HER2 -expressing tumors. Part [ADDRESS_929619] 3+3 dose -escalation design to

or once every 3 weeks (Q3W) to subjects with any HER2 -expressing cancer that had progressed

completed enrollment with no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the MTD was not reached. 
The single agent RD for further study was identified as 10 mg/kg QW or 20  mg/kg Q2W. Part [ADDRESS_929620] in subjects with selected 
HER2 -expressing locally advanced and/or metastatic cancers in up to [ADDRESS_929621] cancer (IHC 3+, or IHC 2+/ fluorescence in situ hybridization

cancers.  
Safety and anti -tumor activity data of zanidata mab monotherapy in GEA and other solid tumors 
was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 annual meeting 
(Meric-Bernstam 2019 ). Among the 58 subjects enrolled in Part 1 and 2, the median age was 
61 years (range 26 –81); 60% were male and 86% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status (PS) of 1. The median number of prior cancer regimens was 
4 (range 1 –10), and 55% had received prior HER2 the rapy. A total of 20/23 GEA subjects (87%) 
had received prior trastuzumab and [ADDRESS_929624] each (4%) had received T -DM1 and neratinib. Only 
2/9 BTC subjects (22%) had received prior trastuzumab; none of the remaining BTC subjects 
had received prior HER2 -target ed agents.  
All treatment -related adverse events (AEs) were Grade [ADDRESS_929625] common treatment - 
related AEs were diarrhea (26 subjects, 45%) and infusion reaction (16 subjects, 28%). There 
were no treatment -related left ventricular ejection fraction (L VEF) decreases ≥ 10% during 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -[ADDRESS_929626] had a treatment -related serious adverse event (SAE), which was 
Grade 2 fatigue. Analyses of 10 mg/kg QW and 20 mg/kg Q2W dosing showed  dose-
proportional and non -linear PK, with steady state reached by  [CONTACT_42334] 2. The  half-life 
(t1/2) of 10 mg/kg QW was approximately 123 hours, and the t 1/2 of 20 mg/kg Q2W was 
approximately 150 hours. The overall exposure was similar for 10 mg/kg QW and 20 mg/kg 
Q2W. The trough values were maintained above the m inimum predicted efficacious level.  
Among all 46 response -evaluable subjects, the ORR (all PRs) was 35% (16/46 subjects). The 
disease control rate (DCR) was 72% (33/46). The median time on treatment for responding 
subjects was 5.1 months (range, 3.3 to 14. 2). With the exception of 2 subjects, all responding 
subjects had HER2 amplification confirmed by [CONTACT_9559].  
The ORR for response -evaluable subjects with BTC was 67% (4/6 subjects); all responses were 
confirmed. Among the 4 BTC subjects with confirmed  objective responses, 3 had GBC and  
1 had ICC. Three of the 4 responding subjects with BTC had HER2 amplification confirmed by 
[CONTACT_9559].  
Based on the above safety and efficacy results, zanidatamab  monotherapy was generally well 
tolerated and has show n promising clinical activity across a range of advanced solid tumors; in 
particular, the ORR was high in subjects with BTCs with HER2 overexpression and 
amplification.  
1.7. Rationale for Zanidatamab  in Recurrent/Relapsed  BTC  
Due to the lack of treatment option s for patients with recurrent/relapsed BTC after frontline 
CisGem, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_685797]. 
To date, studies have shown that HER2 is a relevant target in BTC. Similar to breast cancer or 
GEA,  there is evidence to suggest that HER2 genomic alterations may drive or promote 
oncogenesis, and HER2 -targeted agents have clinical activity in tumors that harbor HER2  over-
expression or amplification. In the ZWI -ZW25 -101 Phase 1 trial, zanidatamab  monoth erapy is 
associated with promising clinical benefit in heavily pre -treated BTC subjects. The current 
Phase  2b trial is therefore designed to confirm the anti -tumor activity of zanidatamab  in subjects 
with relapsed/refractory, HER2 -amplified BTC in the seco nd-line and later setting.

New or archival tumor tissue is required from a ll subjects for HER2 amplification and HER2 
protein expression testing at a central lab using in situ hybridization (ISH) and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Subjects may be tested for HER2 status at the central lab 
any time after diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease and before study enrollment. Subjects 
who elect to be pre -screened for HER2 status must sign a separate informed consent for 
collection, storage, and analysis of the tumor tissue. Once a prospective subject experiences 
disease progres sion or develops intolerance to their most recent prior therapy, the main consent 
for the remaining screening assessments must be signed.  
Two cohorts of subjects will be enrolled:  
• Cohort 1, comprising approximately 75 subjects with HER2 amplification by [CONTACT_136186] H and 
HER2 overexpression by [CONTACT_4658]; i.e., IHC 2+ or  3+ 
• Cohort 2, comprising approximately 25 subjects with HER2 amplification by [CONTACT_685837]2 IHC 0 or  1+

Confidential   Enrolled subjects will receive zanidatamab , 20 mg/kg given intravenously (IV) Q2W until 1 of 
the treatme nt discontinuation criteria is met (see Section 4.4.1 ). Unequivocal clinical progression 
is defined as worsening or re -emergence of pre -existing symptoms relating to underlying cancers 
(e.g., increase in disease -related pain) , or emergence of new symptoms that cannot be attributed 
to study drug toxicities or alternative causes. A marked deterioration in ECOG PS may also 
indicate unequivocal clinical progression. Subjects who discontinue treatment with  zanidatamab  
for reasons o ther than progressive disease or start of subsequent anticancer therapy will continue 
in follow -up with disease assessments approximately every 8  weeks after the previous scan until 
disease progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy. Responses t hat are initially 
observed during this follow -up period should be confirmed with disease assessment 4 weeks 
later. Following progression or start of subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will 
be discontinued, and subjects will enter long -term follow -up for survival status. Data on survival 
will be collected via clinic visits (if feasible) or via telephone calls every [ADDRESS_929630] to follow -up, 
consent wit hdrawal, or study termination by [CONTACT_3211].  
Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be performed 
at baseline and every 8 weeks (Q8W) during treatment timed from Cycle [ADDRESS_929631] 1.1 by 
[CONTACT_89169] (primary endpoint) and investigator (secondary endpoint); responses are to be confirmed 
4 weeks following  initial documentation of objective response by [CONTACT_093].  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_44994], frequency, and severity of AEs graded using the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) 
version 5 .0 (27 November 2017). Safety assessments will include monitoring for SAEs, adverse 
events of special interest (AESI s; infusion -related reactions  [IRRs ], non -infectious pulmonary 
toxicities, and cardiac events of absolute decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10 percentage points from 
pretreatment baseline  and absolute value <  50%, and /or grade ≥  2 heart  failure ), deaths, clinical 
laboratory values, physical examinations, cardiac function, vital signs, body weight, and ECOG 
PS. Safety and study conduct will b e monitored by [CONTACT_82571]

ad hoc meetings (see Section 9.4.12 ). 
Blood samples will be collected at protocol -specified timepoints for evaluation of zanidatamab  
PK and ADA.  
 
 
 
Tumor biopsies will be collected from all subjects at ei ther pre -screening or screening and 
processed as formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissues to assess HER2 amplification, 
protein expression, and exploratory biomarkers of response. Archival tumor tissue may also be 
used. If possible, an additional o ptional tumor biopsy is to be obtained at the time of disease 
progression from an accessible site to allow for assessment of changes in HER2 expression as 
well as the presence of other exploratory biomarkers. Biomarkers of response may be evaluated.  
Only t he biomarkers specified above will be tested on samples collected in Mainland China.

3.2. Discussion and Rationale for Study  Design  
The prognosis for patients with advanced BTC is very poor, with an estimated 5 -year survival 
rate of approximately 5 to 15% for all patients (Valle 2017 ). Gemcitabine combined with a 
platinum agent has become the recognized standard regimen for first -line treatment of patients 
with advanced BTC (Okusaka 2010,  Valle 2010 ). In the second -line setting, results of a recent 
Phase 3 trial (the ABC -06 Study) showed a median OS benefit of 0.9 months fo r subjects treated 
with mFOLFOX plus ASC compared with those who received ASC alone (HR 0.69, 95% CI: 
0.50, 0.97, p = 0.031). However, mFOLFOX treatment was associated with a higher rate of 
Grade 3/4 AEs (59% vs. 39%) and 3 of 81 treated subjects died from  chemotherapy -related 
toxicities (Lamarca 2019 ). Other than the ABC -06 trial, there are no other published randomized 
data in the second -line and later BTC setting.  Pemigatinib  was granted approval for the treatment 
of patients with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
cholangiocarcinoma based on ORR and DOR. In the FIGHT -202 trial, 107  subjects were treated in 
the open -label, single -arm study. The ORR was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27,  45), with a 
median DOR of 9.1 months (95% CI: 6.0, 14.5) (PEMAZYRE ™). 

Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -[ADDRESS_929633] shown that HER2 is over -expressed in BTC, and HER2 -targeted agents 
demonstrate clinical activity in tumors that harbor HER2 over -expression or amplification 
(Kiguchi 2001,  Nakazawa  2005, Treekitkarnmongkol 2010,  Galdy 2017 ) and (Nam 2016 ). 
However, no HER2 -targeted agents are approved for treatment of patients with BTC. Given the 
high unmet medical need for this patient population and the promising anti -tumor activity and 
tolerability of zanidatamab  monotherapy in BTC, a single -arm study design is considered 
appropriate.  
Data from studies in other pathologies indicate that antibody targeting of HER2 is most effective 
in disease that is HER2 amplified and  shows intermediate -to-high levels of protein expression by 
[CONTACT_4658]. In the ToGA study 22.4% of enrolled subjects had FISH positive/IHC 0 or FISH 
positive/IHC 1+ disease (Bang 2010).  A post -hoc exploratory survival analysis fai led to show a 
trend for benefit from the addition of trastuzumab to frontline chemotherapy (Bang 2010 ). The 
recently reported results of the colorectal cohort of the MyPathway study that treated 57 subjects 
with HER2 amplif ied disease demonstrated an overall ORR of 32% (18/57 subjects). However, 
no objective responses were observed in the [ADDRESS_929634] high levels of protein 
expression by [CONTACT_4658] (Meric-Bernstam 2019 ). The primary ef ficacy population for the current 
study will therefore comprise subjects with disease that is HER2 amplified by [CONTACT_685838] 2+ 
or 3+ (Cohort 1, N = 75; see Section 3.1 ). To evaluate the activity of zanidatamab  in subjects 
with lower levels of HER2 expre ssion, subjects with disease that is HER2 amplified by [CONTACT_685839] 0 or 1+ will also be enrolled (Cohort 2, N = 25; see Section  3.1). 
The primary endpoint of this study, confirmed ORR, is a direct measure of antitumor activity and 
is an acceptable endpoint that may be evaluated in a single -arm study according to the FDA 
Guidance for Industry “Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and 
Biologics” (December  2018).  
Standardized RECIS T 1.1 criteria (Eisenhauer 2009 ) will be employed to evaluate disease 
responses during the study, and all imaging assessments will be submitted to an independent 
third -party imaging core laboratory to ensure consistent unbiased application of the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_929635] management and treatment decisions. To 
further assess the clinical significance of ORR in this study, DOR will be evaluated as a 
secondary endpoint.  
3.2.1.  Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  Groups  
This is a single -arm study that will enroll subjects into 2 separate cohorts.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Selection of  Doses  
All subjects in the study will receive 20 mg/kg zanidatamab  given IV Q2W. This dose was a 
recommended dose from the monotherapy part of the Phase 1, dose -escalation study of 
zanidatamab  (ZWI -ZW25 -101).

4.3. Childbearing Potential and  Contraception  
4.3.1.  Definitions  
A person of childbearing potential is anyone born female who has experienced menarche and 
who has not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy , bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], 
bilateral oophorectomy) or has not completed menopause. Menopause is defined clinically as no 
menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 37 of 97 
Confidential   (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However , in the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
A man is considered fertile after pubert y unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_31657].  
According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, pregnant or breastfeeding subjects cannot be 
included in the study, and adequate contraceptive measures should be taken to prevent female 
subjects of childbearing potential or female partners of male subje cts (either of whom are of 
childbearing potential) from getting pregnant from the time of signing informed consent, during 
study participation and for at least  [ADDRESS_929652] dose of study drug (see Section 4.3.2 ). 
Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during this same period 
of time  should be reported to the investigator , regardless of when the pregnancy was confirmed . 
If a female subject is pregnant, the investigator will immediate ly discontinue the subject from the 
study. Upon discontinuation, only those procedures that would not expose the subject to undue 
risk will be performed.  
In the event that a female subject or female partner of a male subject is found to be pregnant after 
inclusion in the study, the pregnancy will be followed to term with subject/partner consent, and 
the status of the mother and child will be reported to the sponsor after delivery.  
Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal page of the case  report form (CRF), 
and a Pregnancy Report Form will be completed.  
4.3.2.  Methods of  Contraception  
The contraceptive standards and acceptable combinations of contraception methods that are 
associated with a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and  correctly are 
considered highly effective birth control methods per the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 
(CTFG) 2014 guidance document: “ Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy in 
clinical trials” . These methods are detailed in  Table 5. 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 38 of 97 
Confidential   Table 5: Acceptable Methods of Highly  Effective Birth  Control  
a Subjects should not simultaneously use more than one form of hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (e.g., if subject is taking oral combined estrogen and progestogen containing  hormonal  contraception, they 
should not use another combined estrogen and  progestogen or progestogen -only hormonal contraception) .  
b Contraception  methods  that are considered  to have  low user dependency per  the CTFG  guidance  document.  
c Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical confirmation of the surgical  success.  
d Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effec tive method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse 
during the  entire  period  of risk associated  with study  treatment.  The reliability  of sexual abstinence  needs  to be  evaluated  
in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the p referred and usual lifestyle of the  subject.  
 
Unacceptable methods of contraception for this clinical trial (either because they have a failure 
rate of > 1% per year or because they are considered unacceptable methods in clinical trials per 
the CTFG guidance document) are listed in Table 6. 
Table 6: Unacceptable Methods of Birth  Control  
• Progestin -only hormonal  contraception  • Male or female condom with or without  spermicide  
• Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with  spermicide  • Periodic  abstinence  
• Withdrawal  • Spermicides  only 
• Lactational amenorrhea method  (LAM)  • Concomitant use of female and male  condoms  
 
4.4. Removal of Subjects From Therapy or  Assessment  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals  or their designee must be notified if a subject is withdrawn from study 
treatment or from the study. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject’s 
medical records and CRF.

Confidential   5.2.1.  Description  
Zanidatamab  is a humanized bispecific antibody recognizing 2 non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_685798]2 antigen. A schematic representation of zanidatamab  is shown in Figure  
2. The  IgG1 -like fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of zanidatamab  contains complementary 
mutations in each constant heavy chain (CH) 3 domain that impart preferential pairing to 
generate a heterodimeric molecule and correspondingly di sfavor formation of homodimers. 
Chain A is otherwise a normal IgG1 heavy chain and forms a fragment antigen -binding (Fab) 
arm through pairing with immunoglobulin G (IgG) Kappa light Chain A’. Chain A/A’ binds to 
ECD2 of HER2. Chain B has an IgG1 -like hinge  and CH2 and CH3 domains, but contains a 
single -chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody rather than a Fab arm. Chain B binds to ECD4 of 
HER2. In place of the CH1 domain it has a variable light (VL) domain, an unstructured 20 amino 
acid linker of glycine an d serine residues, followed by a variable heavy (VH) domain to form an 
scFv  domain. Zanidatamab  is being developed as a treatment for locally advanced (unresectable) 
and/or metastatic HER2 -expressing cancers.

• Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential will be asked to confirm their 
partner is not pregnant.  
• ADA samples (not required if ≤ [ADDRESS_929670]  sample)  
Additionally, all AEs  should continue to be followed until signifi cant changes return to baseline, 
the event stabilizes (recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275], or the subject dies, is lost to follow -up, or withdraws consent, or study closure . 
6.6. Efficacy  Follow -up (Every  8 Weeks)  
Subjects who discontinue treatment with zanidatamab for reasons other than progressive disease 
or start of subsequent anticancer therapy will continue in follow -up with disease assessments 
(per RECIST 1.1 [CT/MRI  scans; include brain scan for sub jects with history or clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_451383]; CT with contrast unless medically contraindicated ]) approximately 
every 8  weeks (±7  days) after the previous scan until disease progression or start of subsequent 
anticancer therapy. Responses t hat are initially observed during this follow -up period should be 
confirmed with disease assessment 4 weeks (+7 days) later. Following progression or start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will be discontinued, and subjects will enter 
long-term follow -up for survival status.  
6.7. Survival  Follow -Up 
Subjects will be followed for survival after discontinuation of study treatment via telephone 
calls, medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 3 months (± 14 days ; 
month  = 30 days) after the last follow -up visit or as directed by [CONTACT_397770], lost to 
follow -up, withdrawal of consent, study completion, or study termination by [CONTACT_456]. 
Subsequent anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_685806] -up will also be collected,  if available.  
7. STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
A schedule of events is provided in Table 1 . 
7.1. Screening/Baseline  Assessments  
Only subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section [ADDRESS_929671] medical history, current 
conditions, and any treatment for prior malignancies and response to prior treatment . 
Tumor biopsies will be collected from all subjects at either pre -screening or screening and 
processed as FFPE tissues to assess HER2 amplification, protein expression by [CONTACT_4658], and 
exploratory biomarkers of response. Archival tumor tissue may also be used. Subjects may be 
tested for HER2 status any time after diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease and before 
study enrollment. An ISH assay is being developed as an investigational use only (IUO) reagent 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 56 of 97 
Confidential   for determining eligibility. An IHC assay is being developed an IUO reagent for assigning 
subje cts to Cohort 1 or 2.  
All samples will be run in a central laboratory under Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA) guidelines. DNA and RNA may be isolated from tissue biopsies for 
characterizing gene expression and somatic mutations associated w ith response.  
Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, and HIV will be performed at 
screening. For female subjects of childbearing potential, screening for pregnancy will be 
performed at screening. These tests may be done using the bloo d samples taken for clinical 
chemistry. A urine pregnancy test is also acceptable.  
7.2. Response/Efficacy  Assessments  
Tumor response will be evaluated at the visits outlined in the schedule of assessments ( Table 1 ) 
based on CT and/ or MRI scans (using the same methodology for each scan of the same subject ; 
CT with contrast unless medically contraindicated ) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus 
additional areas of known or suspected tumor involvement  including the brain for subjects with 
history or clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_451383] . All CT and MRI imaging will be performed 
locally and submitted for centralized independent review. Additional imaging, such as nuclear 
bone scans, may be done as appropriate at the discretion of the i nvestigator.  
Disease response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 ) by [CONTACT_89169] (primary 
endpoint) and investigator (secondary endpoint); responses are to be confirmed 4 weeks 
following initial documentation of objective response by [CONTACT_1697]. Investigator assessment of 
response will be used for all treatment -related decisions.  
Unequivocal clinical progression is defined as worsening or re -emergence of pre -existing 
symptoms relating to underlying cancers (e .g., increase in disease -related pain), or emergence of 
new symptoms that cannot be attributed to study drug toxicities or alternative causes. A marked 
deterioration in ECOG performance status may also indicate unequivocal clinical progression.  
Every effor t should be made to confirm disease progression radiographically. Only in instances 
where subjects appear to have unequivocal clinical progression and it is not possible or feasible 
for the subject to undergo radiologic assessment should investigators remo ve the subject from 
study treatment.  
Subjects who discontinue treatment with zanidatamab for reasons other than progressive disease 
or start of subsequent anticancer therapy will continue in follow -up with disease assessments 
approximately every 8 weeks af ter the previous scan until disease progression or start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy. Responses that are initially observed during this follow -up period 
should be confirmed with disease assessment 4 weeks later. Following progression or start of 
subse quent anticancer therapy, disease assessments will be discontinued, and subjects will enter 
long-term follow -up for survival status.  
Subjects’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification.  
7.3. Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
Venous blood samples fo r measurement of serum concentrations of zanidatamab  will be drawn 
at selected timepoints as specified in the PK assessment schedules. The actual date and time  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 57 of 97 
Confidential   (24-hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded in the subject’s source document at the 
site. 
The first [ADDRESS_929672] of world 
(suitability determined by  [CONTACT_7195]) will be assigned to the more extensive PK 
schedule (Table 2 ). Further s ubjects will be then assigned to the sparse PK schedule (peak -
trough, Table 3 ). Extensive PK for 1 cycle at steady state (Cycle 4 or later ; Table 4) will be done 
for the first [ADDRESS_929673] of the world who reach Cycle 4 ( suitability  determined by [CONTACT_7195]).  
The sampling window for each timepoint is presented in Table [ADDRESS_929674] -dosing. PK 
parameters to be estimated include the following: 1) for single (first) dose: maximum 
concentration (C max), time to maximum concentration (t max), area under the serum concentration -
time curve from zero to the last measu rable concentration (AUC 0-t), terminal  elimination rate 
constant (λ z), half -life (t 1/2), area under the serum concentration -time curve from zero to infinity 
(AUC 0-∞), serum clearance (C L), volume of distribution (V d), etc.; and 2) for multiple doses: area 
under the serum concentration -time curve from zero to the end of dosing interval (AUC tau), 
average concentration (C ave) for Dose 1, C max and minimum concentration (C min) (trough) for 
subsequent doses, accumulation index, fluctuation ratio, steady state con centration (C ss), and 
attainment of steady state.  
Complete instructions for PK sample collection, processing, handling, and shipment will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
If a subject experiences an AE that results in an unscheduled visit or meets SAE  criteria, a blood 
sample for the measurement of serum concentrations of zanidatamab  should be collected if less 
than [ADDRESS_929675] dose of zanidatamab , if possible. The sample will be 
recorded as unscheduled timepoint and may be als o used in PK parameters derivation using 
actual time. An additional sample may also be drawn in the event of an infusion  reaction.  
7.4. Biomarker  Studies  
Blood and tumor tissue samples will be taken at selected timepoints specified in the assessment 
schedule ( Table 1 ) for assessment of biomarkers . Biomarkers may  includ e but are not limited to 
ctDNA, tumor tissue DNA and RNA, HER2 ECD , CA19 -9, and post -treatment HER2 tumor 
status .  
Tumor biopsies or archival tissues will be assessed for HER2 amplification, protein expression 
by [CONTACT_4658], and exploratory biomarkers of response. DNA and RNA may be isolated from tissue 
biopsies for characterizing gene expression and somatic mutations associated with response.  
Tumor samples will also be used f or developi[INVESTIGATOR_685807] (CDx) for this 
study, including but not limited to CDx bridging assays.  
Only the biomarkers specified above will be tested on samples collected in Mainland China.  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -[ADDRESS_929676] for antibodies to zanidatamab  will be obtained at selected timepoints 
specified in the assessment schedule ( Table 1 ). Blood samples for ADAs will be taken before the 
start of the zanidatamab  infusion. All ADA blood sample collection timepoints during the first 
[ADDRESS_929677] dose of zanidatamab , if possible. The samp le will be recorded as 
unscheduled timepoint. An additional sample may also be drawn in the event of an infusion 
reaction.  
The immunogenicity testing will be performed in 3 steps as follows: screening assay (Tier 1), 
confirmation assay (Tier 2), and titrat ion (Tier 3). Only samples positive in the screening assay 
will be tested in confirmation and  only samples positive in the confirmation assay will be  further 
titrated to determine the titer of ADA.  
For any samples that are confirmed positive for anti -zanid atamab  antibody, there may be 
additional testing done to characterize domain specificity (T2a) and possibly neutralizing 
activity.  
Complete instructions for ADA sample collection, processing, handling, and shipment will be 
provided in the Laboratory Manual . 
Additional sample handling, processing, storage, labeling, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_44966].  
7.6. Biospecimen  Repository  
For subjects who provide additional consent, remaining de -identified unused blood and/or ti ssue 
will be retained by [CONTACT_685843]  (not applicable in China) , including 
but not limited to the evaluation of targets for novel therapeutic agents. No germ -line DNA 
testing will be performed. Blood and tissue samples donated f or future research will be retained 
for a period of up to  5 years after study closure, or as permitted by [CONTACT_427]. If additional 
consent is not provided, any remaining biological samples will be destroyed following study 
completion.  
7.7. Quality of Li fe and Disease -Related Pain  Assessments  
The EQ -5D 5 -L questionnaire will be used to assess overall quality of life. If possible, the 
questionnaire should be completed before any other procedures at the study visits noted in the 
schedule of events (see Table 1 ). The EQ -5D-5L consists of a visual assessment scale to assess 
overall health status and the 5 -dimensional score assesses health status in terms of mobility, self - 
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depre ssion. Each dimension has 5 response 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 59 of 97 
Confidential   levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable 
to/extreme problems.  
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form will be used to assess disease -related pain. The BPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_685808] t he severity of pain and its impact on functioning and is widely used in clinical 
trials. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_685809] [ADDRESS_929678] of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including AESIs, SAE s, clinical laboratory tests, concomitant medications, 
including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  over-the-counter medications, and herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  and physical examination 
findings. Other safety assessments include evaluation of ECOG PS, vital signs, ECGs, and 
echocardiogram/MUGA.  
Safety and study conduct will be monitored by [CONTACT_41774], who will be tasked with monitoring the 
safety of participants thr ough regular and/or ad hoc meetings (see Section  9.4.12 ). 
7.8.1.  Adverse  Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the In ternational Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2A guideline Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312.32, IND 
Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigat ional subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  
The following information should be considered when determining whether or not to record a 
test result, medical condition, or othe r incident on the Adverse Events CRF:  
• From the time of signing the pre-screening or main informed consent for the study 
through Cycle [ADDRESS_929679] me dical event occurring 
as a result of a protocol mandated procedure.  
• All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be recorded from Cycle 1 
Day 1 (during and post -dose) through the end of the safety reporting period  (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Complications that occur in association with any procedure (e.g., 
biopsy) should be recorded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol 
mandated.  
• Changes in medical conditions and AEs, including changes in severity, frequency , or 
character, during the safety reporting period should be  recorded.  
• In general, an abnormal laboratory value should not be recorded as an AE unless it is 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms, requires an intervention, results in a SAE, 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 60 of 97 
Confidential   or results in study termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment. 
When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical  
condition  rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” 
rather than “low hemoglobin”).  
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets 1 of the following criteria:  
Fatal:  AE resulted in death  
Life threatening:  The AEs placed the subject at immediate risk of death. This 
classification does not apply  to an AE that hypothetically might 
cause death if it were more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The AE resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685810] -
patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685811] -ups are not SAEs by 
[CONTACT_44134]. Admission to a palliative unit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685812] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685813].  
Disabling/ 
incapacitating:  An AE that resulted in a persis tent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
Congenital 
anomaly or birth 
defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject exposed to the 
molecule or study treatment regimen before conception or during 
pregnancy.  
Important medical 
event : The AE did not meet any of the above criteria but could have 
jeopardized the subject and might have required medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_929680] of an infectious agent.  
Adverse Event Severity  
AE severity should be graded using the NCI -CTCAE, version 5.0. These criteria are provided in 
the study manual.  
AE severity and seriousness are assessed  independently. “Severity” characterizes the intensity of 
an AE. “Serious” is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAEs, above).  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 61 of 97 
Confidential   Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug should be evaluated by [CONTACT_685844]:  
Related:  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the AE, such as:  
● A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known 
to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, 
hepatic  injury,  Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
● One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the 
population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon  rupture)  
There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship based on facts, 
evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather 
than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
Unrelated:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible (e.g., due to underlying 
disease or occurs commonly in the study population), or a temporal 
sequence cannot be established with the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study treatment, or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse  Events  
Investigator and study personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during subject 
questioning, discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing and/or other means by 
[CONTACT_45013]/or SAE form, as appropriate.  
Eliciting Adverse Events  
An open -ended or non -directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to elicit 
the reporting of AEs.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The fo llowing information should be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF:  
• Description including onset and resolution  dates  
• Whether it met SAE  criteria  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study treatment or other  causality  
• Outcome  
The investigator should use precise medical terminology when recording AEs or SAEs. Avoid 
colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 62 of 97 
Confidential   Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e .g., cascade events) should be identified by 
[CONTACT_5252]. For e xample, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it 
is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE. However, medically important events that 
may be linked and/or separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the e CRF. 
For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded 
separately on the eCRF.  
Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation 
time points. Such an event should be recorded only once unless its severity increases or 
decreases (in which case it should be recorded again).  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but then 
subsequently recur s. All recurrences of the AE should be recorded  as separate events . 
Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms  
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual symptoms. 
Groupi[INVESTIGATOR_44971] a diagnosis should only be don e if each component sign and/or 
symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by [CONTACT_685845]. If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, 
report the individual symptom as a separate AE.  
Recording Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the CRF and an SAE form. The following should be 
considered when recording SAEs:  
• Death is an outcome of an event. The primary cause of  death as assessed by [CONTACT_685846].  If the cause of death is truly unknown, then “Death of Unknown Cause” 
can be used as the SAE term for the initial report.  Once the cause of death is known , 
the event term should be updated on a follow -up report.  
• For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in 
response to the illness.  
Progression of the Underlying Cancer  
Clinical manifestations of disease progression that meet the criteria for a SAE must be reported. 
Do not use the term ‘disease progression’ alone when re porting SAEs, because it is too 
nonspecific. Symptoms of disease progression that meet the criteria for an SAE must be reported. 
When possible, report the specific disease (clinical) manifestation of the progression (e.g., 
‘malignant pleural effusion’, ‘sp inal bone metastases’, ‘lymphadenopathy’, ‘brain metastases’).  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland, Limited    08SEP2023 
ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 63 of 97 
Confidential   Pregnancy  
Notification to Drug Safety: Complete a Pregnancy Report Form for all pregnancies that occur 
from the time of first study drug dose until [ADDRESS_929681]’s partner if the estimated date of conception is after the male subject’s 
first study drug dose. Email or fax to the sponsor’s Drug Safety Department within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of a pregnancy. All pregnancies will be monitored for the full duration; all 
perinatal and neonatal outcomes should be reported.  
Collection of data on the CRF: All pregnancies (as described above) t hat occur within [ADDRESS_929682] dose of study drug will also be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.  
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should be reported as an SAE. Congenital 
anomalies or birth defects, as defined by [CONTACT_941] “serious” criterio n above (see definitions 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) should be reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse  Events  
The safety reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from the start of study drug dosing on  
Cycle  [ADDRESS_929683] dose of study drug. However, all study protocol -related 
SAEs are to be recorded from the time of signing the pre-screening or main informed consent for 
the study. All SAEs that occur after the safety reporting period  and are considered related to 
prior zanidatamab  study drug treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_685814].  
All AEs (including SAEs and AESIs) will be followed until significant changes return to 
baseline, the event sta bilizes (recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093], or the subject dies, is lost to follow -up, or withdraws consent, or 
study closure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate  Reporting  
Within 24 hours of observing or learning of an SAE, investigators are to report the event to the 
sponsor, regardless of the relationship of the event to the study treatment regimen.  
For initial SAE reports, available case details are to be recorded on an SAE form. At a minim um, 
the following should be included:  
• Subject  number  
• Date of event  onset  
• Description of the  event  
• Investigator assessment of causality  
• Study treatment  
The completed SAE form is to be emailed or faxed to the sponsor’s Drug Safety Department 
within 24 hours (see email or fax number specified on the SAE report form).  
Relevant follow -up information is to be submitted to the sponsor as soon as it becomes available.

The sponsor will report all SAEs to regulatory authorities as required per local regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
7.8.2.  Adverse Events of Special  Interest  
AESIs are infusion -related reactions, non -infectious pulmonary toxicities, and cardiac events of 
absolute decrease in LVEF of ≥  10 percentage points fro m pretreatment baseline  and absolute 
value <  50%, and /or grade ≥  2 heart  failure . AESIs should be recorded as AEs and reported as 
SAEs when appropriate.  
Additional data related to AESIs may be collected in the CRF.  
7.8.3.  Clinical Laboratory  Tests  
Samples for cl inical laboratory tests will be obtained at selected timepoints specified in the 
assessment schedule ( Table 1 ). 
Clinical laboratory analyses will be performed at local laboratories. Any abnormalities in any of 
the laboratory p arameters will be judged in relation to the reference ranges from the laboratory 
and to the clinical relevance assessed by [CONTACT_093].

• Magnesium  
• Tryptase ( if test is available, only at screening and within 24 hours of an infusion 
reaction)  
The estimated GFR should be calculated using the MDRD equation as applicable, with serum 
creatinine (Scr) reported in mg/dL as follows:  
• GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 x (Scr)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x  (1.212 if 
African  American)  
Urine will be screened for pH, glucose, ketones, blood, protein, and microscopy (if indicated).  
For female subjects of ch ildbearing potential, pregnancy tests will be performed at screening and 
at predetermined timepoints specified in the assessment schedule (see Table 1 ). These tests may 
be done using the blood samples taken for clinical chemis try. A urine pregnancy test is also 
acceptable.  
7.8.4.  Vital  Signs  
Vital signs measurements include heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature. 
Vital signs will be recorded at selected timepoints specified in the assessment schedule ( Table 1 ) 
and performed in a standardized manner (i.e., after the subject has rested in the sitting position 
for 5 minutes). Post -dose assessments should be done within approximately 30 minutes after the 
end of the zanidatamab  infusion.  
7.8.5.  Physical  Examination  
Physical examinations should include assessments of the following body parts/systems: 
abdomen, extremities, head, heart, lungs, neck, and neurological. Height will only be measured 
at screening.

ECOG PS scores are described in Appendix A . 
7.8.7.  Electrocardiogram  
12-lead ECGs will be recorded at selected timepoints  specified in the assessment schedule 
(Table  1) and as clinically indicated. The ECG will be recorded after at least a [ADDRESS_929684]  the following parameters should be assessed: heart rate, PR 
interval, QRS complex, and QTcF.  See Appendix  C for the equation to calculate QTcF.  
7.8.8.  Echocardiogram/MUGA  
Echocardiograms or MUGA scans are recorded at selected timepoints specified in the assessment 
schedule ( Table 1). Echocardiograms or MUGAs will be recorde d locally and will be assessed 
for an estimate of the ejection fraction. The same method must be used throughout the  study.  
Management of left ventricular dysfunction is described in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_929685] procedures for 
evaluating the potential adverse effects of study medications.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments are also common in clinical studies to help characterize dose -
exposure -respons e relationships.  
Immunogenicity is commonly assessed for biologics; therefore, standard tests will be performed 
to detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to zanidatamab . 
8. DATA QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
8.1. Audit and  Inspection  
Study cen ters and study documentation may be subject to Quality Assurance audits during the 
course of the study by [CONTACT_685847]. In addition, inspections may

ZWI -ZW25 -203 Amendment 3 Page 96 of 97 
Confidential   Summary of Changes in 
Amendment 1  
Section(s)  Change  Rationale  
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]   The text has been revised as follows:  
Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms  
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out  
of individual symptoms. Groupi[INVESTIGATOR_44971] a diagnosis should 
only be done if each component sign and/or symptom is a medically 
confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by [CONTACT_45014]. If any aspect of a sign or symptom does n ot fit into a classic 
pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate  AE. 
Important exceptions for this study are adverse reactions associated 
with the infusion of study drug. For infusion reactions, do not use the 
NCI-CTCAE terms of “cytokine release syndrome,” “acute infusion 
reaction,” or “allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.” Instead, record each 
sign or symptom as an individual AE. If multiple signs or symptoms 
occur with a given infusion -related event, each sign or symptom shou ld 
be recorded separately with its level of severity.  To correctly reflect the 
procedure for reporting 
IRRs as AEs. Similar to 
other AEs, IRRs should be 
reported as diagnoses and 
not individual symptoms.  
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]   The text has been revised as follows:  
 
Disease control is defined as a best response of CR, PR non-CR/non -PD 
(for subjects who have only non -target lesions), or SD per RECIST 1.1. 
The proportion of subjects who achieve disease control and the 
corresponding exact binomial 95% CI will be calculated.  For consistency with the 
eligibility criteria, which 
only allows enrollment of 
subjects with target 
lesions.  
Throughout protocol  Minor clarifications/corrections  To provide clarity and 
consistency.

Response:  Long COVID, also known as long-haul COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC), is defined by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC) as having persistent symptoms for >[ADDRESS_1068562] common long COVID symptoms are fatigue, concentration/cognitive impairment (also called “brain fog”) and shortness of breath with exertion. In addition, other long COVID symptoms include dizziness when standing, chronic headaches, diffuse muscle and/or joint pains, abdominal pain, decreased sense of smell or taste, coordination problems, insomnia, anxiety and depression.1 The long 
 Page 6 of 37 IRB Version: 4/1/[ADDRESS_1068563] been coined “neuro long COVID” symptoms. It is estimated that about 20-30% of people infected with COVID develop long COVID with varying degrees of severity.[ADDRESS_1068564] long COVID and over one million are currently disabled from it. Although the cause of neuro long COVID is currently unknown, evidence supports increased neuroinflammation as a contributor to the pathophysiology perhaps being triggered by [CONTACT_778135].3 A recent study showed significantly increased inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) of long COVID patients with brain fog compared to post-COVID patients without any long COVID.4 In addition, there were trends towards increased CSF levels of several other inflammatory markers in neuro long COVID patients. There is also evidence that COVID-19-induced inflammation may reactivate the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in long COVID patients and contribute to the symptom similarities between patients with long COVID and those with EBV reactivation.5 However, it does not appear that increased brain inflammation is reflected in the systemic circulation of long COVID patients. One study did report significantly increased blood acute phase reactants; such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and ferritin; among 120 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 about 4 months previously compared to 120 matched control patients; however, this study did not assess patients for long COVID symptoms.6 A more recent study enrolled 189 patients between July 2020 and July 2021 who had tested positive for COVID-19 about 5 months previously including 104 patients with long COVID.7 This study found no significant differences between either the whole COVID-19 cohort or the long COVID subgroup and 120 control patients who never had COVID for blood CRP, D-dimer or plasma neurofilament light or detection of antinuclear antibody (ANA), anticardiolipin antibody or rheumatoid factor antibody. Another study reported an increase in several proinflammatory cytokines in the serum of post-COVID patients compared to controls but with no differences observed between long COVID and post-COVID patients without long COVID symptoms.8 Thus, the current body of evidence has yet to identify any serum biomarkers for long COVID. Because increased brain inflammation may be involved in the pathophysiology of neuro long COVID and microglia are the primary immune cell in the brain mediating neuroinflammation, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_778120]-brain barrier (BBB) and suppress microglial activation could potentially be effective for treating patients with neuro long COVID. Lithium has been shown to effectively suppress microglial activation and reduce serum inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a).9-12 Lithium is well known to be centrally active as a highly effective treatment for bipolar disorder and readily crosses the BBB and cell membranes via passage through sodium channels.13,14 Although the elemental lithium dosage required to treat bipolar disorder is about 300mg/day, there is clinical evidence that dosages <1mg/day may prevent and slow Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD).15-17 Chronic brain inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both AD and PD.18 The term “elemental lithium” refers to the weight of lithium alone not including the weight of the salt carrier bound to lithium such as the carbonate moiety in prescription lithium carbonate or the aspartate or orotate moieties in over-the-counter (OTC) lithium dietary supplement products. The OTC lithium dietary supplement products available are lithium aspartate and lithium orotate, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_123849] 5mg of elemental 
 Page 7 of 37 IRB Version: 4/1/21 lithium/capsule. Because orotate has been shown to increase the incidences of several cancers in rodent cancer models,19,20 we chose to study the effects of lithium aspartate on blood-based and MRI biomarkers in a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_778121]. In PD patients receiving about 150mg/day of elemental lithium as lithium carbonate or 45mg/day or 15mg/day of elemental lithium as lithium aspartate for six months, mean trough serum lithium levels were 1282, 828 and 195µg/L, respectively, compared to 0.73µg/L in PD patients not receiving lithium (unpublished data). These data confirm that OTC lithium aspartate contains bioavailable elemental lithium.  Preliminary data: Because neuroinflammation may be involved in long COVID pathophysiology and low-dose lithium may have neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases that are known to have increased neuroinflammation, lithium aspartate 5mg/day was suggested by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Guttuso in March [ADDRESS_1068565] of the day lying in bed, according to his parents. Within two days of starting lithium aspartate 5mg/day, the patient reported about 90% improvements in all three of his neuro long COVID symptoms and was able to return to classes. Three weeks later he developed another viral infection and tested negative for COVID but had recurrences of his neuro long COVID symptoms. He increased lithium aspartate to 10mg/day and again reported about 90% improvements in these symptoms within 3-[ADDRESS_1068566] justified conducting this proposed research study to formally determine whether or not low-dose lithium therapy can reduce symptoms of long COVID.     4.2 Include complete citations or references.

 Page 25 of 37 IRB Version: 4/1/21 Subjects will be directly asked by [CONTACT_778146] 2.  All adverse events (AE’s) will be recorded on the AE report form.  Non-serious adverse events will be categorized as follows: • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures.  Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  • For serious subject adverse events (SAE): An adverse event will be considered “serious” (SAE) if the adverse event resulted in subject death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  This is the definition of SAE according to the FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies. When a study team member becomes aware of a possible subject SAE, the study team member will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_52973]. An SAE that is determined by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_79796], a) unexpected, and b) reasonably possible to have been caused by [CONTACT_778147] a “Reportable Event”. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_778130]’s IRB within 7 calendar days of the study team’s first awareness of the event. An SAE that is unexpected by [CONTACT_778148], protocol or consent form with regard to occurrence or at an increased frequency, severity or duration than previously published will be considered a “Reportable Event”. FDA Guidance from 2012 notes that an event should be reported if: -A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) -One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) -An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  • If similar “Reportable” SAEs occur in five subjects, the statistician will be unblinded to the treatment allocation for these subjects and alert the PI [INVESTIGATOR_778131]. If so, the study will be terminated and subjects instructed to stop lithium therapy. • No interim data analysis will be performed. • This study will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to subject enrollment.

NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data. Response:  Side effects from lithium are typi[INVESTIGATOR_778132]. Because this study will be using low dosages of lithium (10-15mg/day), we anticipate a lower risk of side effects than when lithium is given in the higher dosages used for treating bipolar disorder (about 300mg/day). When used at higher dosages for treating bipolar disorder, lithium can cause the following side effects: hand tremors, increased urination, increased thirst, diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness and lack of coordination. None of the [ADDRESS_1068600] taken low-dose lithium (10-15mg/day) has reported any side effects to date.

2  Background 
A woman's organs can shift position overtime as she ages or, in some cases, it can happen without any 
notice or warning.  Pregnancy, childbirth, genetic predisposition, menopause, prior pelvic surgery, 
connective tissue disorders, and factors associated with elevated intra-abdominal pressure such as 
obesity, chronic constipation, and excessive straining can stretch and weaken the muscles that support 
the pelvic organs.  A sheet of muscles, ligaments, and connective tissue called the pelvic floor supports

                          24 October 2011                Page 5 of 32 
 
 the uterus, small intestine, colon and bladder.  If pelvic floor muscles are weak, the organs may drop, 
protruding into the vagina causing a Pelvic Organ Prolapsed (POP).  
 
This condition affects millions of women and with the advancing age of the U.S. population, health care 
providers are likely to encounter women with pelvic organ prolapse with greater frequency.  A woman’s 
lifetime risk (up to the age of 80 years) for undergoing prolapse surgery has been estimated at 11 
percent1.  Approximately 200,000 inpatient procedures for prolapse are performed annually in the United 
States alone2.   
 
Pelvic organ prolapse can be categorized into four areas:  
 Cystocele or anterior prolapse:  When the vaginal wall weakens and allows the bladder to 
protrude into the vagina from above.  
 Vaginal vault or uterine prolapse:  When the top of the vagina loses its support and drops.  
 Rectocele or posterior prolapse:  When the back of the vagina weakens and allows the rectum to 
protrude into the vagina.  
 Enterocele:  When the small intestine drops and protrudes into the vagina.  This usually occurs in 
conjunction with one or more of the other types of prolapse listed above.  
 
Depending on the severity and stage of prolapse, many women do not need treatment.  Some women 
find that their symptoms are relieved through special pelvic muscle exercises call Kegel Exercises , which 
are used to strengthen the muscles that surround the opening of the urethra, vagina, and rectum.  Making 
dietary changes, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and avoiding heavy lifting and straining also 
help to relieve symptoms.  Medication is available to help treat urinary and bowel symptoms of POP.  
Further, a device called a pessary can be inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs.  For 
women who can be fitted properly and whose pelvic organ support can be maintained with a pessary, this 
form of treatment has a high probability of success.

5  Objectives 
5.1  Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of the Axis Dermis graft used for soft tissue 
repair, replacement, reconstruction, or augmentations in the correction of POP as assessed by [CONTACT_115767]-Q 
Stage improvement based upon an objective grading of prolapse of the anterior, posterior or combined 
anterior and posterior (assessed individually) compartment(s) compared between baseline and one year.  
Grading of the prolapse  will be categorized as follows: 
 Cured:  POP-Q Stage reduced to 0 or 1, or improved by 2 stages from baseline 
 Improved:  POP-Q Stage > 1, but improved by 1 stage from baseline 
 Failed:  POP-Q Stage stayed the same or increased in severity from baseline

11  Adverse Events 
11.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant regardless of whether or not 
it is related to the product or procedure.  Any pre-existing condition that exhibits a change in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence is also considered an AE. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an Adverse Event that results in one or more of the following 
outcomes:  
 Life Threatening : The participant was at eminent risk of dying at the time of the adverse 
event.  
 Permanent Impairment : An adverse event that resulted in permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
 Necessitates Intervention : An adverse event that resulted in a condition that necessitates 
medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
damage to a body structure.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/Prolongs Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115765]. 
 Results in Death : An adverse event that results in the participant’s death.  
 
 
An Adverse Reaction  (AR) is a noxious and unintended response to any Hum an Cells, Tissues, and 
Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) for which there is a reasonable possibility that the HCT/P 
caused the response.

11.4  Adverse Event Review 
An Independent Medical Advisor will review all Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions on a 
periodic basis to be determined by [CONTACT_115768].  
12  Withdrawal / Study Exit 
In the event that a participant is unable or unwilling to continue participation in the study, notify Coloplast 
as soon as possible.   
 
If a participant expresses the desire to withdraw from the study, a Withdrawal / Study Exit Case Report 
Form must be completed.  The reason for participant withdrawal must be documented on this form.   
 
In the case that the participant fails to comply with the follow-up schedule, the study site must make 
multiple attempts to contact [CONTACT_2299] (e.g. telephone, registered mail).  Each attempt to contact [CONTACT_115769]’s records.  In the case that the participant is determined 
to be lost to follow-up, a Withdrawal / Study Exit Case Report Form must also be completed.   
 
Participants will be considered to have completed the study after their two year follow up visit has been 
completed and all outstanding adverse events have been resolved or are permanently ongoing.  
13  Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) 
The eCRFs are designed to accommodate the specific features of the study design and will be used to 
capture study specific data and store in a secured FDA 21 CFR 11 compliant database.  Training will be 
provided for all study personnel entering data into the electronic database prior to being given access to 
the database.   
 
Sites will enter data on eCRFs using Electronic Data Capture (EDC).  All visit information will be captured 
in the EDC system.   
   
The data from the questionnaires will be entered by [CONTACT_115770]. 
 
The investigator or relevant staff member who has signed the eCRF Authorization Log may complete the 
eCRF. The investigator will review all eCRFs for completeness and electronically sign the forms. 
14  Statistical Methods  
The key endpoints are specified below: 
 Efficacy :  Efficacy metrics will include objective POP-Q prolapse grading as well as patient 
satisfaction (as measured by [CONTACT_115771]) post-operatively at  
 
 Safety :  Safety will be measured through procedural and product related adverse events.  
Procedural complications will be collected during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Serious product and procedure 
related events will be collected through [ADDRESS_129255] Corporation Confidential Investigation ID: CP009SU 
 
 
                          [ADDRESS_129256] will be responsible for data management and statistical analysis.  Edit checks will be created for 
quality control of all data collected.  Data will be subjected to initial inspection for omitted data, data 
inconsistencies, and deviations.  The resolution of any inconsistencies will be resolved through Data 
Query Forms (DQFs).  The site will be asked to review and respond to the DQFs generated by [CONTACT_115772].

the participant’s records and consent forms and regulatory and study management documents to assess 
the accuracy of the data and study progress.  Any concerns that result from this review will be 
documented and discussed with site personnel.  The site investigator or delegated research staff will work 
with the monitor to resolve all queries.  Resolution of these items and completion of assigned tasks will be 
documented by [CONTACT_2037]. 
 
Monitoring visits will occur based on enrollment rates, duration of the study, site compliance, and data 
quality at each investigati ve site.  Monitoring visits will be performed at least once at all enrolling sites.  
For sites that do not enroll participants, a telephone closeout visit will be completed.

participation is voluntary, and sign and date a consent agreement prior to collection of any study-related 
data. The Informed Consent should be provided to the participant in a language that he/she can read and

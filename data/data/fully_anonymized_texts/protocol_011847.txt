Protocol Date/Version  September  23, 201 4/Amendment 1  
OBJECTIVES  
Primary:  
To evaluate the safety of transplantation of expanded autologous MSC -NTF cells administered on a single 
occasion via combined intrathecal (IT) administration and 24 intramuscular (IM) injections given into the right  
biceps and triceps muscles in patients w ith ALS .   
Secondary:  
To compare the change in slopes from the pre -transplantation period to the post -transplantation period  in ALSFRS -
R between the treatment and placebo groups through [ADDRESS_344886] -transplantation . 
To compare the slope of the rate of decline in the ALSFRS -R at 24 weeks following transplantation relative to the 
12-16 week baseline period before transplantation in all patients (both treatment and placebo groups) . 
To compare the slope of the rate of decline in S VC at 24 weeks following transplantation relative to the 12 -16 
week baseline period befor e transplantation in all patients (both treatment and placebo groups).  
METHODOLOGY  
Study Design  This is a Phase II randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multicenter study that will 
be conducted in 48 patients with early ALS (ALSFRS -R scores of ≥30) at up to 3 study 
sites.  After providing informed consent, each patient will undergo approximate ly 12-16 
week  baseline period during which monthly ALSFRS -R scores and SVCs will be obtained. 
During this period of time their bone -marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal 
cells will be isolated and expanded. Twelve to 1 6 weeks after screening, patients will 
undergo transplantation with their autologous MSC -NTF or matching placebo; product will 
be administered both intrathecally as well as intramuscularly as [ADDRESS_344887] up to  six monthly visits at which the AL SFRS-R and SVC will be obtained, along with 
vital signs, laboratory tests and recording of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs, see scheme below) .

transplantation; thus, each participant’s study participation will last for approximately 9 
months.  The expected study duration (taking into account the limitations of the 
manuf acturing site which is expected to be able to process approximately 2 -4 patients per 
month), the entire study duration is expected to be approximately 12- 16 months.  
Study Drug and Formulation  Study drug will be supplied in:  
• Twenty four 1ml syringes , each  containing 2 x10
6 MSC -NTF cells in 200 µl (10 x106 
cells/mL ) or the same number of syringes containing placebo for IM administration.  
• One 5 ml syringe containing 4 ml of MSC -NTF cell suspension at a dose of 100- 125 
x106 cells or a 5 ml syringe containing placebo for IT administration.  
Dose and Route of Administration  Study drug is to be delivered by [CONTACT_282843].  
The MSC -NTF cell dose is :  
• 100-125 x10
6 cells by [CONTACT_137957]  
• 48 x106 cells by [CONTACT_282844].  
• Participants  randomized to placebo will receive both IT and the same number of IM 
injections . 
Concomitant and 
Excluded Therapy  Study participants will be on a stable dose of r iluzole for at least [ADDRESS_344890] POPULATION  
Number of 
Subjects Planned  48 total (3:1 randomization with 36 subjects in the active treatment arm and 12 in the placebo arm) . 
Major Inclusion Criteria  Age [ADDRESS_344891] onset of weakness  ≤ 24 months and ALSFRS -R ≥30 at

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 8 STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS  
Efficacy  All efficacy analyses will use one -sided alpha = 0.10 tests and present one -sided 90% 
lower confidence limits and two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the difference 
between treatments as well as two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the point 
estimates within each treatment group. All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_6490].   
Secondary Objectives: The change in slope from pre -transplantation to post -transplantation 
in ALSFRS -R and in SVC (as a percent of normal for age and sex) will be est imated using 
the mixed linear statistical model. The fixed effect variables in the model will be:  
• Visit, expressed in days from the beginning of treatment (i.e. pre- treatment times 
will have negative values, post -treatment times positive values) ; 
• Treatment ; 
• Two-way interactions between visit & post- treatment indicator, ([ADDRESS_344896] -treatment visits) and visit & treatment;   
• Three -way interaction between visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment;  
• Site.   
The repeated measur es within a subject over visit will also be accounted for in the model, 
wherein the covariance structure will be evaluated using Bayesian information criterion 
(BIC). Covariance structures to be evaluated are: unstructured, toeplitz, spatial power with 
day, and compound symmetry .  
The three -way interaction between visit & post- treatment visit indicator & treatment will 
be used to compare the change in slope in the treatment group to the change in slope in the placebo group.  
The post -pre slope estimate for t he active treatment group will be used to test the change 
from pre-transplantation to post- transplantation within the active treatment group . 
Exploratory Objectives:  The analysis for EIM (optional) and HHD will employ the same modeling approach as describ ed above for the secondary objectives.  The analysis for 
HHD will be based on a combined score reflecting muscles in the right  arm.   
A further analysis of HHD will compare the score for the right  arm to the score for the left 
arm.  The linear mixed model will include, in addition to the terms described above, an 
indicator for " right  arm", interactions between that indicator and all other variables in the 
model, and a random effect term for the rig ht arm indicator.  
Safety  The proportion of subjects having each AE will be compared between treatment groups 
using Fisher’s exact tests.  
When evaluating changes in safety parameters, baseline will be defined as the last 
measurement prior to transplantation (i.e., prior to treatment).  
Physical examination, neurological examination, hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs , 
ECG and concomitant medications will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, 
mean, standard deviation, median, mini mum, and maximum) if the data is continuous and 
using counts and percentages if the data is discrete.  Shifts from baseline in categorization 
of results (e.g. normal/abnormal or low/normal/high)  will also be summarized.

6.1. INTRODUCTION 
6.1.1. Background  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a fatal neurological disease. There is currently no 
available treatment to stop or reverse its progressive course. There remains an unmet 
medical need for safe and effective treatments for people with ALS.  
Based on putative pathophysiol ogic mechanisms, there are several therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282812] -glutamatergic agents, drugs targeting protein misfolding and 
accumulation, antioxidant therapy, immunomodulatory agents, and stem cell transplantation . 
Cyto -therapy may hold the key to circumventing multiple hurdles in the ALS 
pathophysiological cascade (Morren JA et al. 2012). Apart from the replacement of lost or damaged motor neurons, stem cell implantation therapy may benefit ALS patients by [CONTACT_282845]. Experimental data has shown that non- neuronal cell 
replacement can be a strategic therapy in promoting motor neuron survival and improved neuromuscular function (Corti S et al. 2010). 
Neurotrophic factors secreting m esenchymal stromal cells  (MSC -NTF ) cells are a novel 
cell-therapeutic approach which aims to effectively deliver NTF directly to the site of 
damage in ALS patients.   The MSC -NTF cell therapy (NurOwn) is based on transplantation of autologous bone 
marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC) , which are enriched from the 
mononuclear fraction of the patients’ own bone marrow, propagated ex vivo  and induced 
to secrete NTF such as Glial Derived Growth Factor (GDNF) and Brain Derived Growth 
Factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VE GF) and Hepatocyte growth 
factor ( HGF). These cells are thus designated MSC -NTF  cells .  
The autologous MSC -NTF cells are back -transplanted into the ALS patient into the site s 
of damage, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_52952]/or the muscles, where axon terminals will take up the 
neurotrophic factors secreted by [CONTACT_137954]. In the muscles, the transplanted cells are close to the motor -end plates at the axon terminals, and in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_282813]. Axon terminals take up the NTF and transport them 
retrogradely along the axons into the neuron cell bodies, thus aiming to prevent further degeneration of the neuronal cells.  
NTFs are potent survival factors f or embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are 
considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the 
immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.  
6.1.2. Summary of Previous Clinical Experience with MSC -NTF cell transplantation  
An open- label, two patient -group Phase 1/2 trial of MSC -NTF in 12 people with ALS, has 
been recently completed at the Hadassah Medical Cen ter in Jerusalem, Israel 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).

Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
An interim safety summary  report for the first 12 patients in the study was submitted to the 
Hadassah Medical Center Ethical Committee about two month after  transplantation  of the 
12th patient . One SAE (death due to cardiopulmonary arrest) was reported as non-
treatment related. The majority of the other AE observed were  procedure related and not 
treatment related . 
Four  compassionate use ALS patients have been treated with MSC -NTF cells with no 
apparent safety related concerns.  
The first compassionate use ALS patient was treated by [CONTACT_282848] 1 x 106 
cells/ kg body weight autologous MSC -NTF cells. During the 5 months follow up, no 
treatment -related adverse effects had been reported. 
The s econd compassionate  use ALS patient received a combination of IT and IM 
injection s of autologous MSC -NTF cells: 1 x 106 cells/ kg body weight IT and 1x106 
cells/site in [ADDRESS_344909] compassionate use patient (diagnosed with both ALS and m yasthenia gravis) 
received a higher combination dose of I T and IM injection s of autologous MSC -NTF 
cells, namely 1.5 x 106 cells/kg  body weight IT and 1.5 x  106 cells/site in 24 sites IM for a 
total of 147 x 106 MSC -NTF cells. During the 2 months follow -up no significant side 
effects were observed. This compassionate use patient s howed a n improvement in the 
ALS FRS-R score, in muscle power (muscle chart) and in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_108951] 
(FVC ). 
This patient was subsequently re -treated [ADDRESS_344910] improved.  A case report for this patient 
entitled 'Rare Combination of Myasthenia and ALS, Responsive to NTF -MSC Stem Cell 
Therapy' was recently accepted for publication in 'Muscle and N erve'.  
No formal assessment was performed for the repeated treatment of this compassionate 
treated patient, or for the fourt h compassionate treated patient . Brainstorm Cell 
Therapeutics has not received any reports from the treating physicians of any adverse effects suspected to be due to the product in these four patients .

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 17 6.1.3. Summary of Relevant Nonclinical Experience with MSC -NTF  
[IP_ADDRESS]. The Role of Neurotrophic F actors  in ALS  
Neurotrophic factors (NTF) are small, naturally occurring polypeptides that support the 
development and survival of neurons. NTF are reported to be potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons  and s tudies in ALS animal models have shown a 
delay in disease onset and/or progression after administration of various neurotrophic factors . Therefore, NTF are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS as well as 
for other neurodegenerative diseases.  
Several studies in peripheral nerve injury have shown that NTFs play an important role in the development, maintenance and regeneration of the nervous system. BDNF was shown to prevent the loss of motor units and to contribute to the maintenance of muscle  mass 
when administered to the hind limb muscles of mice after neonatal peripheral nerve injury (Mousavi K et al., 2004). In addition BDNF enhances branching and arborization of Corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_149389] (Ozdinler PH et al., 2006).  GDNF and Insulin Grow th 
Factor  1 (IGF-1) are two of the most potent survival factors known for peripheral neurons. 
Several studies have shown that GDNF and IGF -1 can prevent neuronal degeneration in 
mice and rats after axotomy, as well as the programmed cell death of motor neu rons 
during development (Henderson, CE, et al. 1994, Mohajeri H et al. 1999, Wang, LJ et al. 2002, Acsadi G et al. 2002, Ozdinler PH et al.
 2006, Suzuki M et al. 2008).  
The ability of growth factors to protect dying motor neurons has also been extensively studied in ALS  models of disease.   
A variety of preclinical and clinical studies already suggest that local delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects for ALS. 
The VEGF family, which includes factors  that are primarily associated with angiogenesis 
are now increasingly recognized to have neurotrophic effects.  
Reduced expression of a member of this family, VEGF -A, in mice results in 
neurodegeneration similar to that of ALS, while treatment of animal mo dels of ALS with 
either VEGF -A gene therapy or VEGF -A protein has yielded positive therapeutic 
outcomes. These basic research ﬁndings raise the potential for a VEGF therapy to be translated to the clinic for the treatment of ALS ( Reviewed Keifer et al 2013 ).  
Increased expression of VEGF by [CONTACT_282850]
 (Azzouz, M et al. 2004, Zheng, C et al. 2004). 
Intracerebroventricular administration of VEGF in a rat model of ALS enhanced motor neuron survival, whereas an intraperitoneal injection of VEGF led to the preservation of 
neuromuscular connections
 (Storkebaum, E, et al., 2005) . Moreover, a recent study 
indicates that intramuscular administration of a VEGF zinc finger transcription factor activator, which can induce VEGF expression, improves motor functions in SOD1- G93A 
rats  (Kliem, MA, et al., 2011) .  
A recent study has shown that hMSC engineered to express GDNF and VEGF synergistically significantly prolonged survival and slowed the loss of motor function in a rat model of ALS (Krakora D. et al. 2013).  
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was first identified and molecularly cloned as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes (Nakamura et al., 1984, 1989).

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 18 Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is also a potent in vitro and in vivo survival -promoting 
factor for neurons (Kadoyama K, et al. 2007). HGF was first identified and molecularly 
cloned as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes (Nakamura et al., 1984, 1989). 
Subsequent studies revealed that  HGF ex erts multiple biological effects (c -Met) 
(Funakoshi and Nakamura, 2003).  
Neurotrophic effects of HGF have been demonstrated in vivo on embryonic spi[INVESTIGATOR_282814] (Nov ak KD et al. 2000). O verexpression of neuronal HGF has been shown to result 
in the attenuation of neuronal cell death and progression of disease in a familial ALS transgenic mouse model  (Sun W et al. 2002). Introduction of the HGF gene into neurons 
of transgenic mice expressing human mutant Cu⁄ Zn superoxide dismutase (G93A mice) 
attenuates motor neuron degeneration and increases the life span of these mice. (Sun W et al. 2002). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. In vitro protection of motorneur ons by [CONTACT_282851] -NTF cells  
In order to test whether MSC -NTF cells are capable of rescuing motoneurons, we 
examined the effects of conditioned media of the MSC -NTF cells on a motoneuron cell 
line (NSC -34, Cashman NR et al. 1992). We found that the conditioned medium protects 
from NO damage (induced by [CONTACT_282852] -1), glutamate toxicity, H
2O2 (Sadan O et al.2009, 
Yust -Katz S et al. 2012) and hypoxia (Fig. 1 ) suggesting that soluble factors secreted from 
MSC -NTF cells may  protect motor neurons from the damage associated to the 
pathophysiology of ALS.

disease and an extended life span.  Additionally the life span of the MSC -NTF treated 
SOD1 mice increased by 18.8 days as compared to saline injected SOD1 mice (151.8 vs .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Therapeutic Effects of Differentiated Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a Rat Model of Sciatic Nerve Injury  
Motor neuron (MN) loss is the origin of several fatal, progressive neurodegenerative 
diseases including ALS (Boillée et al., 2006). It is characterized by a progressive loss of MNs from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem, and cerebral cortex.  
Sciatic nerves are the l ongest and largest single nerves in the body. They begin in the 
lower spi[INVESTIGATOR_282815]. The sciatic nerves 
innervate the back of the thigh, leg and foot muscles. 
Since the sciatic nerve supplies movement to mos t of the lower limb, damaging this motor 
system, models lower limb paralysis and the deficits that occur in diseases like ALS. 
While the etiologies of ALS and lower limb paralyses differ, the clinical presentations have similarities, and both lack effectiv e treatments.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_344916] of autologous MSC -NTF cells was studied in the sciatic nerve injury 
model in rat as a model for motorneuron damage which is representative of the damage 
seen in ALS (Dadon -Nachum M et al 2011a).   
We examined whether MSC -NTF cells are capable of rescuing motor neurons in a 
unilateral Sprague -Dawley rat Sciatic Nerve Injury ( SNI) model. The right hind limb 
sciatic nerve was crushed for [ADDRESS_344917] branching of the 
nerve using a clamp. One day later, rats were transplanted with rat MSC -NTF cells or 
control into the site of the lesion. Four days afte r transplantation, in rats injected with the 
MSC -NTF cells, motor function measured by [CONTACT_282855] 
(73% vs. control in the MSC -NTF cells treated rats as compared to 41% in the control -
injected  group, p<0.01).  
These finding i ndicate that intramuscular transplantation of autologous MSC -NTF cells 
rescued neuron  damage in the sciatic nerve injury in rats  and therefore support  the notion 
that MSC -NTF can protect and increase restoration of motor -neurons , the cell population 
that s uffers the most damage in ALS (Dadon -Nachum M et al 2011). 
 
6.1.4. MSC -NTF Benefit and Risk Assessment  
ALS is a fatal neurological disease. There is currently only one product approved for the treatment  of ALS, namely, riluzole, which was demonstrated to increase time to 
tracheostomy or death in patients randomized to riluzole compared to those randomized to placebo .  No other products have been approved for the treatment of ALS since riluzole’s 
approval in 1995.  Thus, there remains a great unmet medical need for  safe and more 
effective treatments for people with ALS.  
Most of the current investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282817], such as anti -
glutamatergic agents, drugs targeting protein misfolding and accumulation, antioxidant therapy  and immunomodulatory  agents, focus on one of multiple putative 
pathophysiologic mechanisms.  
Cyto -therapy may hold the key to circumventing multiple hurdles in the ALS 
pathophysiological cascade (Morren JA et al. 2012). Apart from the replacement of lost or damaged motor neurons, stem cell implantation therapy may benefit ALS patients by [CONTACT_282856].  
Experimental data have  shown that non- neuronal cell replacement can promot e motor 
neuron survival and improved neuromuscular function (Corti S et al. 2010). Preclinical studies in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases have shown 
benefit s of MSC -NTF transplantation , which support  the evidence that these cells may be 
effective treatment of ALS patients.  
Autologous MSC -NTF transplantation appe ars to be generally safe in the [ADDRESS_344918] has been administered in two open- label GCP compliant clinical 
trials as well as in five treatments in 4 patients  with ALS  in which the cells were 
administered on a “compassionate” basis  treatment.

The dose for the proposed Phase [ADDRESS_344921] IM and IT combined administration

In our previous study a trend towards a decreased rate of decline on the ALSFRS -R and on 
FVC was observed in the IT treated patients over [ADDRESS_344922] should be further 
evaluated in this indication .  
MSC are plastic- adherent cells isolated from the mononuclear fraction of the bone 
marrow. The bone marrow compartment is a convenient source for MSC.  
In summary , autologous trans plantation of adult bone marrow -derived MSC offers 
practical advantages since:  
• Bone marrow cells can be easily and safely obtained by [CONTACT_80605][INVESTIGATOR_1516]. 
Although the crude bone marrow contains only very low numbers of MSC (1:104-
105), they can be enriched and expanded ex -vivo from the bone marrow 
mononuclear cell fraction.  
• There is no need for immunosuppression since rejection is  not expected when 
autologous MSC are administered.  
Potential risks of participation in this study are  considered to be low, and include the 
following:  
• Risks associated with bone marrow harvesting and related conscious sedation 
• Risks of LP include post -LP headache  and CSF  leak that could potentially  requir e 
treatment.   
• Risks of IM administration may includ e local skin irritation at the injection site s.   
• As this is an autologous treatment and there is variability between patients' cells' 
growth capabilities , there is also a possibility that patients' cells will not grow 
sufficiently and may not allow the required cell dose to be transplanted  back .  
Therefore, the potential benefits of IT and IM injections  of MSC -NTFs justify the 
small risk s associated with th e harvesting of Bone Marrow  and administration of this 
autologous product.

during which monthly ALSFRS -R scores and SVCs will be obtained. During this period 
of time their bone -marrow will be harvested and deriving mesenchymal stromal cells will 
be expanded. Twelve to 16 weeks after screening, patients will undergo transplantation 
with their autologous MSC -NTF or matching placebo; product will be administered both 
intrathecally as well as intramuscularly as [ADDRESS_344926] -001-US Amendme nt 1:

The 48 participants will be randomized (3:1) into a treatment or  into a placebo group 
which will occur at Visit 3.  Cells from the treatment group participants will be propagated 
in a cell culture facility over a period that can range from 24 to 38 days.  Participants in 
both the treatment  and placebo  groups  will then undergo combined IT and intramuscular

The autologous production process is on a per -patient basis  and begins upon fresh bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_282818]. Because t he production capacity of the cell manufacturing facility is 
limited , it will be the limiting factor for the rate of enrolment. Based on the  production 
capacity  limitations, patients are expected to be recruited at a rate of approximately 2 -4 
patients/months  throughout the trial .

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 26 6.3.7. Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
The study is a randomized double blind placebo control led study . The control group will 
be given placebo.  It is expected that 36 subjects given MSC -NTF and 12 subjects DMEM 
in the placebo  arm will provide an adequate number of subjects to compare rates of 
adverse events  between the treatment and control groups and allow us to explore the 
effects on the  rates of decline on the ALSFRS -R and SVC between the  treatment and 
placebo control groups  as well as individual change s from baseline scores through Week 
24 following treatment.  
One of the study exploratory endpoints is aimed at determinin g feasibility of succeeding in  
performing successful IT administration of MSC -NTF cells and of blinding patients and 
caregivers to the treatment in anticipation of performing a larger Phase III efficacy study.  
ALS is a terminal disease , and life expectancy of patients is usually 3 to 5 years after 
diagnosis of ALS. Early stage ALS patients (≤24 months from ALS symptom onset and 
ALSFRS -R ≥30) were therefore chosen as the study population, to increase chances of 
participants of  complet ing the full 9 months study and to obtain a patient population with a 
relatively homogenous rate of disease progression thus  increas ing the power for detecting 
a difference in the  efficacy outcomes  (either between treated and controls or change from 
baseline among treated vs. untreated subjects) . Rates of decline on the ALSFRS -R in such 
patients are reported  in the  published scientific literature to range from - 0.92 ± 0.08 
points/month (Castillo -Viguera et al 2010 , NEALS data ) to 2.35 (Sorenson EJ et al. 2008) .   
Since ALS is a fatal, progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by [CONTACT_282859] -
neuron cell death in the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], accompanied by [CONTACT_282860] t to 
prevent its progressive course, a reduction in the  slope of decline in the ALSFRS -R and/or 
in the SVC  reflected as a change in disease progression ( slope ) compared to concurrent 
placebo controls will be considered to constitu te a response  that will be  evaluated further 
in Phase III clinical studies .  
6.4. SUBJECT POPULATION  
This study will be conducted in subjects with a clinical diagnosis of ALS who meet the El Escorial criteria (Brooks, B.R., et al 2000) for possible, laboratory -supported probable,

6.6. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT INFORMATION 
6.6.1. General Information  
The cell therapy is based on the autologous transplantation of adult bone marrow derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) which are induced ex- vivo to secrete 
neurotrophic fact ors (NTFs) such as Glial Cell Line Derived Neurotrophic Factor 
(GDNF), Brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Vascular Endothelial  Growth Factor 
and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and are thus designated MSC -NTF cells. The MSC -
NTF cells are derived from  hMSCs isolated from the patient’s own Bone Marrow, 
propagated in -vitro  and induced to secrete NTFs using a medium base d procedure.  
MSC -NTF cells are adult stem cells that  are used for a utologous “Self -transplantation”. 
There is no ethical or safety issues of involvement of embryonic cells. Since the cells are the patient's own cells there is no risk of rejection and no need for immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long -term side effects.  
MSC -NTF cells delivery is easy and safe by [CONTACT_282864] (IT and IM injections) 
and does not require surgical intervention.  
6.6.2. MSC -NTF  Product Characteristics  
Participants’ bone marrow is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_282827], propagated in culture and induced to secrete NTFs. The MSC -NTF cells are then transplanted back into the patient as following:  
• 125 x10
6 cells by [CONTACT_137957] (however, if less than [ADDRESS_344964] 100 x 10
6 cells are administered)  
• 48 x106 cells by [CONTACT_282844].  
Patients randomized to placebo will receive both IT and the same number of IM injections  
The MSC -NTF cells' production process is carried out in the absence of antibiotics in the 
absence of phenol red and in the absence of animal derived components. The production 
process is cGMP compliant and is performed under full environmental control, in a cl ass 
10,000 cleanroom (ISO 7). All cell manipulation procedures are performed in a class 100 (ISO 5) laminar flow hood.  
The MSC -NTF cells are provided in a ready -to-use participant -personalized unique 
treatment package with the appropriate primary and seco ndary labels. The treatment

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 36 package consists of one 5 ml syringe for IT transplantation, and twenty four 1 ml syringes 
for IM transplantation. Each treatment package consists of ready -for-injection syringes 
containing freshly harvested autologous cultured MSC -NTF  cells at the dose defined for 
the appropriate route of administration in the clinical study protocol.  
Syringes will be capped with a stopper (not a needle). The 5 ml syringe for IT 
transplantation will be packed in a pouch. The 1 ml syringes for IM transplantation will be 
placed in a 7 -compartment tray that will be packed in a pouch.  
The treatment /placebo  package is delivered to the clinical site in a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_137937] a te mperature of 2 -8°C during shipment. The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_282828]. Product should be administered to the patient within 5 hours from packaging.  
Placebo will be provided in the same num ber of syringe s types and sizes as the cell -
containing syringes . 
All treatment as well as placebo syringes  will be masked to preclude  physician and 
patient's identification  of their content. In addition the sponsor will make every effort to 
ensure blinding  of the study by [CONTACT_282865].  
The cell production process, including the in- process controls is described in full detail in 
the CMC section and in the Investigator's brochure (IB).  
6.6.3. Treatment Compliance  
It is expected that participants  will b e fully compliant during the pre -transplant follow -up 
period.  
Since patients are recruited at the early stage of the disease and ambulatory (Disease 
symptom s onset ≤ 24 months and ALSFRS -R ≥30 prior to Screening Visit) they are 
expected to be able to comp lete the full [ADDRESS_344966] –treatment compliance, it will be attempted to recruit patients 
living in the vicinity of the medical centers and /or previously  known to the Investigators.  
6.6.4. Test product, Dose and  Admin istration  
Placebo or participants'  autologous MSC -NTF cells  will be used  for a combination 
treatment of 125x 10
6 cells intrathecally, (however, if less than [ADDRESS_344967] 
100 x 106 cells are administered), and 2x106 cells/site intramuscularly  divided equally

[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (An AE or suspe cted adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137940]. Examples of such medical even ts include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Relatedness (Causality)  
Investigators will assess relatedness of adverse events to study drug using the following 
terms: 
• Definite : An AE that has a clear temporal association with investigational product 
administration (e.g., within 24 hours); provides a plausible pharmacologic explanation for the event;  
• Probable: There is a reasonable temporal association with administration of th e 
investigational product; unlikely caused by [CONTACT_282866];  
• Possible :  There is a plausible temporal association with the investigational 
product, but other etiologies are possible and relatedness to the investigational product cannot definitely be ruled out.  
• Unlikely:   The temporal association with the investigational product is 
implausible (but not impossible). The event is likely related to other drugs or conditions. 
• Not Related : An AE with no temporal association with the inves tigational product 
but rather related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or conditions or subject's known clinical state; subject has not received investigational product. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity (Intensity)  
The severity of an adverse event will be grad ed on a scale: mild, moderate, severe, as 
defined below:  
• Mild :  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Moderate:  Minimal, local or non -invasive  intervention indicated; interferes with 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
• Severe:  Disabling; unable to carry out age -appropriate activities of daily living.  
• Potentially Life -Threatening :  Medical or operative intervention indicated to 
prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or de ath 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow -Up of AEs  
After the initial recording of an AE, the Investigator should proactively follow the patient.  Any non -serious AEs that are still on -going at the end of the study should be reviewed to 
determine if further follow -up is required.  The Investigator will document on the eCRF 
any/all on -going non- serious AEs that will not be followed further after the patient exits 
the study.  If in doubt, the Investigator should consult the study Medical Monitor.    
All SAEs should be followed until resol ution, until the condition stabilizes, or until the 
patient is lost to follow -up, or otherwise explained.  Once the SAE is resolved, the 
corresponding AE eCRF page should be updated.  Additionally, any relevant laboratory 
test reports, consultation reports  from other health care professionals, discharge 
summaries, or other information that has been gathered about the event should be transmitted to the Sponsor.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities  
Any laboratory abnormalities deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_282867]. A clinically significant abnormality is a confirmed abnormality (by [CONTACT_75481]) that is changed sufficiently from Screening so that in the judgment of the Investigator a change in management is warranted. This alteration may include: monitoring the laboratory test further, initiating other diagnostic tests or procedures, chang ing ongoing treatment, or administering new treatment. Whenever possible, the 
etiology of the abnormal finding (e.g., anemia) will be recorded on the CRF. Repeated additional tests and/or other evaluations required to establish the significance and etiolog y 
of an abnormal result should be obtained when clinically indicated.  
6.8.2. Reporting Responsibilities and Procedures for AEs and SAEs  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator or Sub- Investigator(s) to perform periodic 
assessment of all AEs/SAEs.  
A subject, who experiences an AE, whether serious or not serious, should receive appropriate treatment and medical supervision as clinically indicated. AEs/SAEs will be followed throughout the subject’s participation in the study, until resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually agreed upon between the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.  
The Investigator must report to the Sponsor all SAEs within [ADDRESS_344975] provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon r eceipt of significant 
information if the event is still ongoing).

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 43 6.9.2. Secondary Endpoints:  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Revised ALS Functional Ra ting Scale (ALSFRS -R) 
The ALSFRS -R is a quickly administered (10 minutes) ordinal , validated rating scale 
(ratings 0 -4) used to determine patients' assessment of their capability and independence in 
12 functional activities.  All 12 activities are relevant in ALS.  Initial validity was 
established by [CONTACT_137990], change in ALSFRS -R scores correlated 
with change in strength over time, as measured by [CONTACT_282869], and with quality of life measures, and predi cted survival ( Cedarbaum, J.M., et al. 
1999, Greenberg, S.A., et al 2005). The test -retest reliability is greater than 0.[ADDRESS_344983] 
items .  The advantages of the ALSFRS -R are that  the categories are relevant to ALS, it is 
a sensitive and reliable tool for assessing activities of daily living function in patients with ALS, it is quickly administered , and is validated over the phone as well
1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Slow Vital Capacity (SVC)  
SVC measure th e maximum amount of air a patient can exhale in a single breath. SVC is 
used frequently in ALS clinic as part of a battery of tests used to assess diaphragmatic weakness and monitor disease progression. SVC will be measured with patient seated in 
upright position.  It can be measured quickly and effectively in the office setting . 
6.9.3. Exploratory 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hand Held Dynamometry (HHD)  
HHD is a quantitative measure of muscle strength and has been validated against 
maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) ( Greenberg, S.A., et al. 2002).  
Proximal arm and distal arm muscles will be examined bilaterally.  To normalize for 
varying strength of individual muscles, all values will be expressed as percent change 
from baseline; this value can be averaged to provide upper extremity, lower extremity, and 
total megascores.  An additional analysis will use m ean and standard deviation for each 
muscle group established from the initial values for each subject in this trial, so that strength determinations can be converted to Z scores (the difference between the obtained 
score and the mean, divided by [CONTACT_33902] d eviation).  These Z scores can be combined 
in similar fashion to what was discussed above to produce megascores as well. 
Muscle strength measurements (elbow flexion, wrist extension, knee extension, and ankle 
dorsiflexion) will be performed using the Hand Held Dynamometer (HHD), as described 
in appendix [ADDRESS_344984]. 2005

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 44 [IP_ADDRESS]. Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM, Optional)  
EIM measures the electrical impedance of individual muscles as a repr esentation for 
muscle composition, which changes with disease progression.  Using a single probe that 
contains both stimulating and recording electrodes, measurements are taken twice over each muscle.  The probe is placed against a clean area of skin for l ess than 10 seconds per 
recording.  Four muscles will be tested in upper and lower extremities; elbow flexors, wrist extensors, knee extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors, for a total of [ADDRESS_344986]. The minute electrical signals produced by t he stimulator are imperceptible; 
subjects only notice the pressure of the probe against their skin.  Sites will have the option of collecting the EIM outcome data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_282830].  Since MSC -NTF secrete several known neurotrophic factors, we 
intend to develop ELISA assays for neurotrophic factors and use these assays to assess the concentration of these factors after treatment.  We are also exploring the possible assessment of several putative ALS biomarkers in these CSF samples.  
6.9.4. Statistical Methods and Sample Size Determination 
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Minima and maxima will be reported with the same precision as the raw values; means, standard deviations, and medians will be presented  to one additional decimal place than reported in the raw values. Summaries for 
discrete variables will include frequencies and percentages. All percentages will be 
rounded to one decimal place (i.e., XX.X%). Differences between treatment groups will be calculated as MSC -NTF cells  – placebo and change from baseline will be calculated as 
post-treatment – pre-treatment (OR follow -up visit – baseline:  e.g. Week 2 – baseline, 
Week 4 – baseline) . The baseline visit will be defined as the last non -missing measure  
prior to initiation of investigational treatment.  Additionally, for the pre -transplantation 
period and transplantation visits, change from screening (V1) summaries will be 
calculated as pre -transplantation period/transplantation visit – screening.  
All eff icacy analyses will use one- sided alpha = 0.10 tests and present one -sided 90% 
lower confidence limits and two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the difference 
between treatments as well as two -sided 95% confidence intervals around the point 
estimates within each treatment group. All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_6490].   
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized  prior to database lock, 
unblinding and analysis of study  results .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  analyses  
Prim ary Objective
: The safety of MSC -NTF transplantation via combined IT and IM 
injection in participants with ALS is the primary objective of this study. Safety endpoints include AEs, changes in physical and neurological examination findings, hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, and requirement of concomitant medications.  
All AEs will be coded to System Organ Class ( SOC ) and Preferred  Term ( PT) using the 
MedDRA®. The number of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  (TEAEs ) and the 
number of subjec ts with any TEAEs (along with percentages) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_282870]. To count the 
number of subjects with any TEAEs, a subject who experiences multiple TEAEs within 
the same SOC will be counted only once for that SOC (whether or not the TEAEs are 
coded to the same PT). A subject who experiences multiple TEAEs coded to the same PT 
within the same SOC will be counted only once for t hat particular PT. In the summary, 
SOC will  be listed in a scending alphabetical order ; PTs will be listed in order of 
descending frequency for all subjects  within each SOC .  
Separate summaries will be provided for the following categories of AEs:  
• TEAEs  
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_926]  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs  
The proportion of subjects having each AE will be compared between treatment using 
Fisher’s exact tests.  
When evaluating changes in safety parameters, baseline will be defined as the last 
measurement prior to transplantation (i.e., prior to treatment).  
Physical examination, neurological examination, hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs and concomitant medications will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) if the data is continuous and using counts and percentages if the data is discrete. Shifts from baseline  in categorization of 
results ( e.g. normal/abnormal or low/normal/high ) will also be summarized.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 46 [IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary Objectives : The change in slope between the treatment and placebo group and 
from pre -transplantation to post -transplantation in ALSFRS -R and in SVC (as a percent of 
normal for age and sex) will be estimated using the mixed linear statistical model.   
The f ixed effect variables in the model will be: 
• Visit, expressed in days from the beginning of treatment (i.e. pre -treatment times 
will have negative values, post -treatment times positive values).   
• Treatment  
• Two-way interactions between visit & post -treatment  indicator, ([ADDRESS_344989] -treatment visits) and visit & treatment  
• Three- way interaction between visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment 
• Site 
The repeated measures within a subject over visit will also be accounted for i n the model, 
wherein, the covariance structure will be evaluated using Bayesian information criterion 
(BIC). Covariance structures to be evaluated are: unstructured, toeplitz, spatial power with 
day, and compound symmetry.  
The three- way interaction between  visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment will 
be used to compare the change in slope in the treatment group to the change in slope in the placebo group.  
The post -pre slope estimate within each  treatment group will be used to test the change 
from  pre-transplantation to post -transplantation . 
Repeated measures covariance will be estimated by [CONTACT_79363].  The Kenward and Roger method will be used to determine degrees of freedom and compute p -
values.  
Secondary objectives will be evaluated for the FAS, as well as the PP populations.  Exploratory Objectives
:  The analysis for EIM (optional) and HHD will employ the same 
modeling approach as described above for the secondary objectives.  The analysis for 
HHD will be based on a combined score reflecting muscles in the right arm.    
A further analysis of HHD will compare the score for the right arm to the score for the left arm.  The linear mixed model will include, in addition to the terms described above, a n 
indicator for "right arm", interactions between that indicator and all other variables in the model , and a random effect term for the right arm indicator. Therefore, the fixed effect 
variables in the model will be: 
• Visit, expressed in days from the beginning of treatment (i.e. pre -treatment times 
will have negative values, post -treatment times positive values) ;   
• Treatment ; 
• Right arm indicator ; 
• Two-way interactions between visit & post- treatment indicator ([ADDRESS_344990] -treatment visits), visit & treatment, visit & right arm indicator, 
and treatment & right arm indicator ; 
• Three- way interactions between visit & post- treatment visit indicator & treatment, 
visit & post -treatment indicator & right arm indicator, and visit & treatment &  
right arm indicator ; 
• Four -way interaction between visit & post -treatment visit indicator & treatment & 
right arm indicator ;

Muscle str ength tests will be assessed at  visits 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, [ADDRESS_345011] two trials is greater than 15 % or if the evaluator thinks that one of the first two trials was not valid.  The numbers will be recorded on the forms provided by [CONTACT_282878].    
The testing pad for the HHD should be changed to fit the contour of the subject’s body. The finger test pad must be used for testing the first dorsal interosseous. The HHD should always be flat against the body part being tested and the force directed opposite to the direction of movement.   Prior to testing the subject with the HHD, the evaluator must ensure that the subject is able to actively move into the test position.  
The subject should rest between trials and then return to the starting position. The subject 
should be encouraged to push against the HHD with all of his/ her strength.  Subject must hold maximal contraction for at least two seconds.  Evaluator should match subject’s resistance for at least two seconds before increasing their force to break the contraction.  Encouragement needs to be consistent with all subjects.    
Shoes and orthotics should be removed prior to testing the legs.  Stabilization of the 
subject  is very important and should follow the instructions provided for each muscle 
group.  The subjects cannot hold on to the armrest during testing.  Subjects can be 
supported with pi[INVESTIGATOR_282838]. Subjects can use BIPAP if needed during the testing.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 60 6.15.3. Appendix 3: Procedure for IT transplantation of MSC -NTF cells  
The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure and define the basic 
requirements for Intrathecal (IT) Transplantation of BrainStorm's proprietary MSC -NTF 
cells in clinical trials.  
The procedure described here is based on common clinical practice (standard lumbar puncture procedure) as well as the experience of the medical staff currently conducting the company's clinical trial at the Neurology Department of the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Product Handling and injection procedures  
All syringes should be gently  rotated for 20- 30 seconds until all cells are in suspension. 
For IM  injections remove syringe cap and connec t a 25Gx5/8” (0.5 x  16 mm) needle.  
With the needle in the upright position gently flick the syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Push the plunger up until the first drop is visible at the tip of the needle. At this point the product is ready for inject ion. 
For IT injections gently remove syringe cap. With the syringe in the upright position 
gently flick syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Slowly and carefully push plunger up, until the liquid meniscus is visible at the top of the (needle -less) syringe. Connect syringe 
to the [ADDRESS_345026] the cells over roughly 2 minutes  (see section  
[IP_ADDRESS]. below) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. IT Injection Procedure:  
1. When performing IT transplantation of MSC -NTF cells, the patient is typi[INVESTIGATOR_282839] a left (or  right) lateral position with his/her neck bent in full flexion and knees 
bent in full flexion up to his/her chest, approximating a fetal position as much as possible.  
2. The area around the lower back is pre pped using aseptic technique.  A 20 G, 3.5 
inch, 0.9x90 mm spi[INVESTIGATOR_13911] (such as: BD Cat. No. 405253) is inserted between the lumbar vertebrae L3/L4 or L4/L5 to a depth at which there is a "give" indicating that the needle is past the ligamentum flavum.  3. The needle is inserted further until there is a second 'give', indicating that the 
needle is now past the dura mater and in the subarachnoid space.  
4. The stylet from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_137943] a 3- way stopcock (such as 
Elcam Medical Cat. No. 582682) is immediately attached to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_13911] .  
5. A 3 to 5 ml syringe, with the plunger drawn back, is attached to the 2nd outlet of 
the stopcock, and approximately 3 ml of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) is removed (CSF is not ’aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831]’ since any negative pressure can be harmful, so the syringe plunger is  drawn 
back before connecting the syringe, and the syringe with the drawn -back plunger is then 
connected to the 2nd outlet of the stopcock and the CSF thus flows into the syringe).  
6. The syringe containing the CSF is removed and closed, the air is removed f rom the 
syringe and the syringe is then again placed at the [ADDRESS_345027] outlet of the valve, and the cells are injected over roughly 2 minutes.  8. The stopcock is then immediately turned back to the 2nd outlet and approximately 
1 ml of the previously collected CSF is injected, "washing" the spi[INVESTIGATOR_282840] e entire cell suspension is transplanted into the patient.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 61 9. The procedure is completed by [CONTACT_282880].  
10. The syringe containing the remaining 2 mL of CSF is removed and capped and 
should be transferred to storage at -80ºC within 30 minutes of the completion of the 
procedure.

Amendment  1 – 23Sep14  Confidential  Page 62 6.15.4. Appendix 4:  Procedure for IM transplantation of MSC -NTF cells  
The purpose of this document is to describe the procedure and define the basic 
requirements for Intramuscular (IM) transplantation of BrainStorm's proprietary MSC -NTF cells in clinical trials.  
The procedure described here is based on common clinical practice (IM injection) as well 
as the experience of the medical staff currently conducting the company's clinical trial at  
the Neurology Department of the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Product  Handling and injection procedures  
All syringes should be gently  rotated for 20- [ADDRESS_345030] a 25Gx5/8” (0.5x16mm) needle.  
With the needle in the upright position gently flick the syringe to surface any trapped bubbles. Push the plunger up until the first drop is visible at the tip of the needle. At this point the product is ready for injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedure:  
1. For IM transplantati on of MSC -NTF cells, the patient may be in a reclining or 
upright position. The upper arm area is prepped using aseptic technique.  In case of a hairy arm the arm is shaved prior to IM injections. 2. The syringes for IM injection contain an 0.32 ml suspension of MSC -NTF cells, in 
a 1 ml Luer -Lock syringe (such as: Becton Dickinson Cat. No. 309628), attached to a 
25Gx5/8” (0.5 x 16 mm, such as Becton Dickinson Cat. No. 300600) needle.  
3. The MSC -NTF cell suspension (0.2 ml) is transplanted into the patient by [CONTACT_282881] (IM) to a 1.5 cm depth (ensuring that injection is into the muscle and not into adipose tissue) at 24 separate sites on the patient's right  upper arm  biceps and 
triceps muscles, according to a map based on the designed grid (see below).  4. The procedure is completed by [CONTACT_282882].  
5. The patient's arm is bandaged with a pressure bandage  
6. The patient is typi[INVESTIGATOR_282841] [ADDRESS_345031] -001-US Amendme nt 1:

b. Type B Cohort : The Follow -up Period for Cohort B subjects will end approximately [ADDRESS_771807] dose of study drug (Section 5.4) 
Note: Contraception requirements must be continued for  [ADDRESS_771808] dose of study drug  for 
Type  A and B Cohorts . 
Written informed consent for study participation may be obtained up  to 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit for 
Type A Cohort subjects and  8 weeks  prior to  the Screening Visit  for Type B Cohort subjects . Evaluation of 
eligibility will be based on laboratory results, medical history, concomitant and prior medications, vita l signs, 
12-lead ECG, physical examination, pregnancy testing (if applicable), and, in Type B Cohort , renal biopsy results.  
Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility to receive the next dose based on laboratory and clinical criteria prior to 
each dose. Th e pre -dose laboratory evaluations may be performed at a local or central laboratory up to 14- days 
prior to the next target dosing day or on the target dosing day. If a subject discontinues study drug treatment prior 
to the last dose, they will be asked to return to the clinical study site to complete all follow up visits , as described

Extent of exposure to the study treatment as measured by [CONTACT_586713]. Adverse events (including DLTs) will be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) v 20.1, or higher  version and graded using the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v  5.0) for the 
purposes of data summarization. Incidence of TEAEs, TESAEs, TEAEs leading to  study drug discontinuation, 
 TEAEs with an outcome of death will be summarized by [CONTACT_57807] (SOC) and preferred term. Adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_586714].  
 
Clinical laboratory data will be descriptively summarized, including observed values at collection timepoints and 
change from baseline. All la boratory parameters that can be graded using CTCAE  v 5.0 will be graded. For 
selected parameters, the following summaries may be produced:  
• Worst post -baseline severity grade  
• Shift summary of baseline grade to worst post -baseline severity grade  
Safety evalu ations may also include changes in the subject’s vital signs, and ECG results. The incidence of 
treatment -emergent anti -EQ001 binding and neutralization antibodies will be reported.  
PK Analyses:  
Serum concentrations will be listed and summarized for each EQ001 dose using descriptive statistics for each 
cohort . 
Efficacy Analyses:  
apLN Subjects :  
The geometric mean  fold change from baseline in UPCR from a urine collection to FU1 and FU2 will be 
summarized  descriptively , along with their 2 -sided 95% CI for the fold change. The geometric  mean  fold change 
from baseline over time by [CONTACT_586715].   
The proportion of subjects with a >  30% and > 50% decline in UPCR  and those with a UPCR < 500 mg/g at FU1 
and FU2 will be described, along with their 2 -sided 95% CI.   
Time to UPCR decrease  of > 50%, > 30%, and to a level of <  500 mg/g  from baseline will be summarized using 
the Kaplan -Meier method . Baseline proteinuria is defined as the mean of the [ADDRESS_771815]  treatment , such as MMF/MPA  or time 
since pulse corticosteroids  (i.e., >12 weeks vs < 12 weeks, or by [CONTACT_39125]) . Additional subgroup analyses may be 
performed based on the data collection such as severity of lupus nephritis , baseline proteinuria  or previous 
treatments.

Proprietary and Confidential   7 INTRODUCTION  
7.1 Background  
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a n autoimmune  chronic inflammatory diseas e 
predominantly affecting women  in the reproductive age range . The prevalence of SLE varies 
considerably by [CONTACT_545], ethnicity, and geographical location  Prevalence of SLE in 
the [LOCATION_002] has been reported to be between 20 to 150 cases per 100,000 (but as high as 
406 per 100,000 among African American women)   
Lupus nephritis  (LN) is a serious complication of SLE that results in significant morbidity and 
mortality. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_586701] -inflammatory and immunosuppressive 
treatments, progression of LN to chronic kidney disease is common and 10% of patients develop 
end-stage kidney disease  A number of risk factors affect the likelihood of 
progression of LN to end -stage kidney disease, i ncluding histologic class  . The 
presence of Class III (focal segmental) or Class IV  (diffuse proliferative)  LN increases mortality 
by [ADDRESS_771817] improved overall survival and renal survival; however, in a study of patients with 
Class IV LN (diffuse glomerulonephritis), only 43% achieved a complete remission , with 24% 
achieving a partial remission, and 32% achieving no remission ). Ten-year patient 
survival for patients  with complete, partial, and no remission in this study was 95%, 76% and 
46%, respectively. The corresponding 10 -year renal survival was 94%, 45%, and 19%, 
respectively. Patient survival with freedom from end -stage kidney disease at 10 years was 92%, 
43%, and 13% for patients with complete, partial, and no remission, respectively.  
T cells are a major factor in driving the immune pathology associated with LN  
 One important regulator of T cell activity is CD6 , a tightly -regulated, 
co-stimulatory receptor  that serves as a key checkpoint in regulating T eff cells that are central to 
autoimmune responses   CD6 is high ly expressed on CD4+ T eff 
cells but not on regulatory T cells [T reg]  Via interactions with its ligand,  
activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), CD6 plays  an integral role in modulating 
T cell activation and trafficking. Preclinical  data and clinical studies in other autoimmune 
diseases ( psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis) have demonstrated  that blockade of CD6 
co-stimulation leads to selective inhibition of pathogenic T eff cell activity and trafficking, while  
preserving the essential  regulatory function of T reg cells  
 
 
7.2 Itolizumab  
Itolizumab (Bmab 600; EQ001) is a humanized recombinant immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively targets t he extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine -
rich (Sc) membrane -distal domain 1 of human CD6  
 a co -stimulatory membrane glycoprotein ass ociated with T  cell modulation and 

Equillium, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. EQ001 -19-002 Page 33 of 110 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, multiple 
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sj ögren’s disease  
. 
EQ001 binds to domain -1 of huma n CD6 and is believed to sterically hinder the optimal 
engagement of ALCAM with domain -3, modulating both co -stimulation and trafficking without 
causing T  cell depletion.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The binding of ALCAM to CD6 also facilitates lymphocyte trafficking , and disruption of this 
interaction, as demonstrated through the use of CD6KO mice an d/or anti -CD6 mAbs, results in 
reduced T  cell infiltration into inflamed tissues  Additionally, in 
clinical trials with itolizumab, skin biopsies exhibited significantly reduced levels  of infiltrating 
CD3 positive T  cells  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Equillium, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. EQ001 -19-[ADDRESS_771818] s were  exposed to T1h at doses of 
0.1 to 1.6 mg/kg.  T1h demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis and 
definitive evidence of efficacy in plaque psoriasis   leading to approval of 
itolizumab in India for the treatment of plaqu e psoriasis. A conditional approval for itolizumab 
for the treatment of plaque psoriasis was also granted by [CONTACT_586716], 
Cuba on [ADDRESS_771819] by: (a) inhibiting multiple pathogenic T eff cells and cytokine secretion; 
(b) inhibiting trafficking of T eff cells into kidney tissues; and (c) reducing the T h17:T reg ratio 
associated with LN. Given the central role that T eff cells play in the immunopathogenesis of SLE 
and LN, EQ001, which blocks t he CD6 -ALCAM pathway and inhibits both the activity as well 
as the trafficking of T eff cells, represents a promising therapeutic approach in this disease.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Equillium, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. EQ001 -19-[ADDRESS_771820] are anticipated to be studied in a Type B Cohort. Additional subjects may 
be added a t the maximum -tolerated dose (MTD) cohort and/or to an additional cohort at an 
intermediate or lower dose  in Type A . The exact numbers of each type of cohort will be 
determined by [CONTACT_586717].  
To qualify for enrollment in the study, all  subjects must have a diagnosis of SLE. Additionally, 
to qualify for enrollment in a Type B Cohort, subjects must have apLN, defined as proliferative 
LN (International Society of Nephrology [ISN]/Renal Pathology Society [RPS] Class III or IV 
with or withou t Class V) diagnosed by [CONTACT_193742] [ADDRESS_771821] for newly diagnosed disease or 
relap sing/flaring disease  or need additional treatment for incomplete responders . Restricted SLE 
treatments (e.g., immunosuppressive medications and antimalarials) are required to be stable 
and/or washed out  Subjects in the Type B Cohort  may have  
glucocorticoids administered and  tapered  
). Investigators will adhere to the pr otocol steroid taper schedule unless a safety 
concern (including concern related to insufficient response) necessitates departures from the 
schedule. Such planned departures must be discussed with the Medical Monitor , preferably  in 
advance  of the change in medication . 
8.1.1 Type A  
Type A will utilize a cohort dose escalation design. If <  2 of the 6 evaluable subjects in a Type  A 
dose-escalation cohort experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  during the DLT evaluation 
period (Day s 1-29), then escalation may occur to the next higher dose level. If [ADDRESS_771822] exceeded the 
MTD, the Data Review Committee (DRC) may recommend continuation of the study (with or 
without modification) and may expand enrollment to evaluate additional subjects at the M TD 
and/or an additional cohort at an intermediate or lower dose to better define the MTD.  
Type A Cohort enrollment will proceed in a sequential manner to evaluate escalating dose levels 
of EQ001. The first dose level to be studied, Dose Level 1, will be 0. 4 mg/kg and the maximum 

Equillium, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. EQ001 -19-[ADDRESS_771823] subjects will be evaluated with urine PCR (including 
24-hour ur ine collections), eGFR , and doses of prednisone (or equivalent).  
8.[ADDRESS_771824] cohort s to be studied at any new higher dose and will 
receive only 2 doses  (over 4 weeks). Only once a dose is determined to not have exceeded the 
MTD  will that dose  be allowed to be studied in an expansion cohort  of Type B subjects  over a 
longer treatment duration ( 24 weeks).  
Ongoing review of safety data for adverse trends will occur throughout the study. A DRC  with 
expertise in nephrology and rheumatology will review data prior to dose  escalations and will 
provide recommendations to the Sponsor as described in the DRC Charter and in Section  8.8.1 . 
In addition, the Sponsor and/or Medical Monitor will perform regular ongoing review of safety 
data during the study.  
Clinical experience w ith EQ001 has identified lymphopenia  and injection -site (hypersensitivity) 
reactions  such as  fever as potential adverse drug reactions related to study drug administration.

8.3.3 Systemic Reactions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Therapeutic protein products may elicit a range of acute effects, from symptomatic discomfort to 
sudden, fatal reactions that have o ften been described as “infusion reactions” in the past. Infusion 
reactions may encompass a wide range of clinical events, including anaphylaxis and other events 
that may not be directly related to antibody responses, such as cytokine release syndrome. All 
monoclonal antibodies have the potential for infusion/injection site and hypersensitivity 
reactions; therefore, these reactions are regarded as class -specific toxicities for monoclonal 
antibody drugs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fever and other Injection -Related Reactions  
Potential  systemic manifestations of infusion /injection -related/hypersensitivity reactions 
including urticaria, pruritus, and fever have been observed following treatment with EQ001.  
For this study, in which the study drug will be administered SC, injection -related reactions are 
defined as acute onset of an illness (other than those limited to the injection -site, which are 
described above) occurring within 48 hours of study drug admini stration that is otherwise 
unexplained (e.g., by [CONTACT_586718]’s medical history) but does not meet the 
definition of anaphylaxis . Signs of possible injection -related reactions include : 
fever, chills, pruritus, urticaria, chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, and hypertension.  
In this study, dosing will be done at the study site , and subjects will be monitored for evide nce of 
such reactions. Because individual signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity such as fever are non -
specific, investigators are required to clinically evaluate symptoms for etiology to guide 
management. Guidance for symptomatic and supportive treatment of presumed signs and 
symptoms of hypersensitivity are included in the protocol  (Section  10.7). Subjects experiencing 
Grade 3 or higher injection -related reactions will be discontinued from study drug treatment. 
Specific information about such reactions will be collected in the eCRF  to fully characterize 
them.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is a severe, p otentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction that occurs suddenly  after 
contact [CONTACT_284017] -causing substance, such as an investigational product. Anaphylaxis will 
be evaluated using the diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis as outlined by [CONTACT_941] 2006 Joint  National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Second 
Symposium on Anaphylaxis (see Appendix  D). Subjects wi th a history of anaphylaxis to foods 
or drugs will be excluded  from the study . Any subject experiencing anaphylaxis  considered

Proprietary and Confidential   related to the study drug by [CONTACT_586719].  
Doses will be escalate d by [CONTACT_586720], with special 
attention to hypersensitivity dose -limiting toxicities. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
(Injection -related reactions and anaphylaxis) have also been defined as AE SIs, and thus are to  be 
reported with clinical details of the event within 24 hours ( Section  12.6) for review by [CONTACT_586721] . 
8.[ADDRESS_771825] safety by [CONTACT_586722], investigators, and the DRC . All subjects will receive EQ001 . The dose 
levels selected (from 0.4 to 3.2 mg/kg) will allow an assessment of the full dose -response curve 
of EQ001. Dose escalation will occur by [CONTACT_586723], PK, and other data to inform dose -escalation decisions based on pre -defined 
DLT criteria and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
The Type A Cohort subjects will receive [ADDRESS_771826] s for approximately 4 weeks. The multiple ascending dose data from 
Type A Cohorts is expected to provide sufficient safety and pharmacokinetic data to allow the 
study of a dose (1.6 mg/kg) determined not to exceed the MTD in the apLN populat ion (Type B 
Cohort s ubjects) over a longer duration. Type B Cohort subjects will receive  [ADDRESS_771827]  6 months of 
treatment as noted in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
glomerulonephritis guidelines ( https://kdigo.org/guidelines/gn/ ). Prolonged treatment will also 
enable a better understanding of the exposure -response relationship, long-term safety, dose 
selection, and the effect size.  
This design feature is intended to minimize risk to subjects and to allow exploration of a safe 
range of doses  over relatively short treatment duration  as well as  to explore  doses associated with 
PD and c linical activity.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_771828] are non -targeted immu nosuppressive  medications : 
cyclophosphamide and/or mycophenolate with glucocorticoids  For 
patients who do not achieve remission with these treatments or who are unable to tolerate them, 
there is no standardized approach to management because there is a general lack of evidence -
basis  This study will enroll subjects with  biopsy -proven active proliferative  Class 
III or IV (with or without Class V) LN who have proteinuria (>  1000 mg/g) and evidence of 
serologic activity who require induction treatment for apLN for newly diagnosed disease or

Proprietary and Confidential   relapsing/flaring disease . In this study, we will enroll patients with apLN  who are, by [CONTACT_108], 
at high risk for adverse renal outcomes ( Section  7). Further, the study population will  consist of 
subjects who continue to have LN activity clinically and serologically despi[INVESTIGATOR_586702] . This is a patient population for whom there is a clear unmet medical need  and for 
whom the risk -benefit for the addition of an investigational ag ent to standard treatments is 
justifiable, particularly with close and careful monitoring that is required as part of this protocol.  
In order to select EQ001 doses to examine in the apLN  population for a 24-week treatment period,  
the safety, pharmacokineti cs, and pharmacodynamics effects of EQ001  of each dose will first be 
studied in patients with SLE with or without active disease (and who do not have  apLN ) over a 
4-week treatment period. This sequential approach of first evaluating each dose in a shorter 
treatment period in a less ill population allows for the initial evaluation of safety with multiple 
doses, optimization of dose selection for study in the apLN  population , and also  is intended to 
mitigate risk by [CONTACT_586724] a gi ven dose to a shorter course of treatment.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_771829] body of clinical data exists to inform the selection of a starting dose and dose regimen 
for EQ001 in this study.  
A starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg  administered SC was chosen for evaluation in the initial group of 
6 subjects, with additional cohorts receiving the planned doses of 0.8, 1.6, 2.4, and 3. 2 mg/kg 
EQ001, based on safety, tolerability, PK,  and clinical activity.  
 
 
 
 
 
The present study is designed to assure adequate trough levels while assessing the potential for 
accumulation in this short -term study. Because the study population is at increased risk for 
lymphopenia due to the underlying disease condition (SLE) and concomitant background 
treatment(s) ( e.g. mycophenolate mofetil),  and because of the potential risk of EQ001 causing a 
decrease in  lymphocyte counts , the starting dose of EQ001 in this study will be lower 
(0.4 mg/kg) than the lowest dose studied in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study  (0.8 mg/kg) . 
Based on the safety, PK,  results from Type A cohorts in conjunction with data from 
other EQ001 studies such as in aGVHD, the 1.6 mg/kg was selected as the starting dose for the 
Type B cohorts.  This dose was well tolerated in Type A sub jects, and there was evidence of 
reduced cell surface level of CD6 on T cells, a PD marker for cellular activity .

8.7 Cohort Dose Escalation  (Type A Cohorts)  
The study will utilize a dose escalation design  for Type A Cohorts . If <  2 of the 6 evaluable 
EQ001 -treated subjects in a Type A dose -escalation cohort experience a DLT  during the DLT 
evaluation period (Day s 1-29), then escalation may occur to the next higher dose level. If [ADDRESS_771832] 
exceeded the MTD, the DRC may recommend continuation of the study (with or without 
modification) at doses at or below the MTD. Alternatively, a n additional cohort at an 
intermediate lower dose may be added to better define the MTD.  
Type A Cohort enrollment will proceed in a sequential manner to evaluate escalating dose levels 
of EQ001. The first dose level to be studied, Dose Level 1, will be 0.4 mg/kg and the maximum 
dose level to be studied will be 3.2 mg/kg. Intermediate dose levels of 0.8, 1.6, 2.4 mg/kg are 
planned, but other intermediate doses or doses lower than 0. 4 mg/kg may be chosen based on 
emerging PK, PD, and safety data. Subjects in Type A Cohorts will receive a total of 2 doses, 
2 weeks apart.  
The MTD determination will be made based only on Type A Cohorts. Dose escalation is allowed 
to proceed if no predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_586703] . 
 Based on emerging data, the DRC may recommend expanding a dose cohort that has not 
exceeded the MTD (up to 6 additional subjects) and/or adding a dose cohort  at an intermediate 
lower dose  level (with up to 6 subjects) .

Proprietary and Confidential   12 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease or any w orsening of a pre -existing condition temporally associated 
with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to study drug.  The AEs that occur after the 
first dose of EQ001 or during the study treatment and safety follow -up periods will be 
documented on  the AE eCRF. The investigator will assess AE severity and the causality 
relationship of the AE to study drug. The investigator will treat the subject as medically required 
to ensure the subject’s safety.  
Laboratory values that are outside the laboratory reference range should be reported as AEs only 
if the investigator considered those AEs to be clinically significant.  
From the time of signing the ICF through the first study drug administration, all SAEs and 
nonserious AEs related to protocol -mandated pro cedures  (including medication washout 
performed specifically for the study)  will be recorded on the SAE/AE eCRF. All other untoward 
medical occurrences observed during screening, including exacerbation or changes in the 
medical and surgical history, will b e captured on the medical and surgical history eCRF. Details 
on recording and reporting AEs are provided below. All AEs will be captured through the last 
required Follow -up visit or the ET Visit , whichever is later . 
Investigators should use their clinical judgment to determine whether a subject is to be 
withdrawn due to an AE. In the event the subject discontinues study treatment or is withdrawn 
from the study due to an AE, the subject should be asked to complete all remaining FU study 
visits . In the event a subject is withdrawn from the study, an ET Visit should be completed.  
All subjects experiencing AEs, including clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, 
whether or not associated with the study drug, must be monitored until the condition (1)  returns 
to normal, (2) returns to the subject’s baseline, (3) the investigator determines the AE has 
reached a stable outcome and is no longer clinically significant, or (4) the subject is considered 
lost to follow -up. 
12.1 Severity  
All AEs, both serious and nonserious, will be assessed for severity using the NCI CTCAE v  5.0. 
The CTCAE scale includes unique clinical descriptions of AEs categorized by [CONTACT_248953]/or 
pathophysiology. Reference the following website:  
https://cte p.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_8.5x11.pdf  
The CTCAE scale displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for 
each AE (including abnormal laboratory values), based on this ge neral guideline provided in the 
scale. For AEs not covered by [CONTACT_3989], the conventional definition of severity will be used, as 
follows:  

Equillium, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. EQ001 -19-002 Page 75 of 110 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   • Grade 1 (mild) AE: Minor; no specific medical intervention; marginal clinical relevance.  
• Grade 2 (moderate) AE: Minimal intervention; local intervention; noninvasive 
intervention.  
• Grade 3 (severe) AE: Significant symptoms requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586706].  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling) AE: Complicated by [CONTACT_9420], life -threatening 
complicatio ns; need for intensive care or emergent invasive procedure.  
• Grade 5: Fatal AE  
12.2 Causality Assessment  
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing and assigning the 
causality relationship of the event to study  drug or study -related procedures ( e.g., invasive 
procedures, such as venipuncture) using clinical judgment and the following categories of 
relatedness:  
• Related: There is at least some possibility that the AE could be related to study drug or a 
study -related procedure . 
• Not re lated:  There is a high degree of certainty that the AE is NOT related to study drug 
or a study -related procedure .  
In making a causality assessment of an AE, it should be considered as to whether or not the AE 
is expected to occur due to the underlying dis ease, based on the investigator’s clinical experience 
in managing SLE (Section  12.5.1 ). 
12.[ADDRESS_771864]’s baseline value(s). The investigator may repeat the 
laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. In 
general, abnormal laboratory  findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's 
judgment) are not to be recorded as AEs. However, laboratory value changes that require 
treatment or adjustment in current therapy are to be considered AEs. When applicable, clinical 
sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the AE.  

Equillium, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No. EQ001 -19-002 Page 76 of 110 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   12.4 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (Note: A life -threa tening AE is one that, in the view of the 
investigator places the subject at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenita l anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical o r surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
 
 
All SAEs, regardless of cause(s) or causal relationship to study drug, must be reported within 
24 hours to the study Spon sor and/or designee.  If an SAE occurs outside the reporting window of 
the subject’s follow -up or ET visits and is considered related to study treatment, it must be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site’s awareness.  
12.[ADDRESS_771865] are reported using the AE eCRF.  
The investigator will assign the following AE attributes:  
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms)  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  
• Severity  
• Causality relationship to study drug or study -related procedures  
• Action taken  
• Outcome

designee must be notified by [CONTACT_586729] [ADDRESS_771867] are promptly assessed and reported  to the Sponsor and/or designee. The 
investigator must assess the causality relationship of the SAE to study drug or any study -related 
procedure.  
The procedures for reporting SAEs are as follows:  
• Within 24  hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event , enter data into  the AE/SAE 
eCRF . If the EDC is not available, the paper SAE Report Form may be used, but all data 
must be entered into the EDC once the EDC is available.  
• Additional contact [CONTACT_325706]/SAE reporting instructions will be provided in the  
eCRF Completion Guidelines.  
• For fatal or life -threatening events  and all SAEs , also email and/or fax redacted copi[INVESTIGATOR_586707] , autopsy reports, and other documents, when requested and applicable. 
Transmission of such documents should occur with  personal subject details de -identified  
(redacted) , without losing the traceability of a document to the subject identifiers. Entry 
of the initial report of the event  into EDC  should not be delayed in order to include these 
additional documents.  
• The Sponso r and/or designee may request additional information from the investigator to 
ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
The investigator must take all necessary therapeutic measures for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_586708].  
Follow -up of SAEs will continue through the last day on the study and/or until a definitive 
outcome ( e.g., resolved, reso lved with sequelae, lost to follow -up, fatal) is achieved.  
While pregnancy is not considered an AE, all cases of fetal drug exposure via a maternal parent 
as study subject or pregnancy of a partner of a male study subject that occurs during the study or 
within [ADDRESS_771868] be documented on a Pregnancy 
Confirmation and Outcome Form, provided by [CONTACT_4885], and the pregnancy 
should be followed until a definitive outcome has been determined.

during the study and for [ADDRESS_771877] be approved both by [CONTACT_586735]/ IEC prior 
to presenting it to a subject. Each ICF must comply with th e ICH GCP Guidelines  and applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
Investigators may discuss study availability and the possibility for entry with a potential subject 
without first obtaining consent. However, informed consent must be obtained and documented 
prior to initiation of any procedures that are performed solely for the purpose of determining 
eligibility for research, including withdrawal from current medication(s). The informed consent 
process should take place under conditions where the s ubject has adequate time to consider the 
risks and benefits associated with his/her participation in the study. The investigator or qualified 
designee must explain to each subject the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards of  the study.  
Once appropriate essential information has been provided and fully explained in layman’s 
language to the subject by [CONTACT_093] (or a qualified designee), the approved ICF will be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_586736] (investigator or designee), 
as well as by [CONTACT_78629]/ IEC. The subject will receive a copy of the 
signed ICF; the original will be retained in the study files. The investigator must document the 
consent interview and pl ace the record in the study files. The investigator shall also maintain a 
log of all subjects who sign the ICF and indicate if the subject was enrolled into the study or 
reason for non -enrollment.  
14.[ADDRESS_771878] assure that subjects’  anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthori zed parties. Only subject initials, age, another unique 
identifier (as allowed by [CONTACT_1769]) and an identification code will be recorded on any form or 
biological sample submitted to the Sponsor, IRB/ IEC, or laboratory. Laboratory specimens must 
be labeled in such a way as to protect subject identity while allowing the results to be recorded to 
the proper subject. Refer to specific laboratory instructions (or in accordance with local 
regulations). NOTE: The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and 
addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the study. Subject data will be 
processed in accordance with all applicable regulations. (Some studies may require double -
coding of samples).  
The investigator agrees that all information received from the Sponsor, including but not limited 
to the EQ001  Investigator’s  Brochure , this protocol, CRF/eCRF, the study drug, and any other 
study informa tion, remain the sole and exclusive property of the Sponsor during the conduct of 
the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except 
employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without

Guidelines, the investigator will permit the Sponsor’s representatives and, when necessary, 
representatives of the regulatory authorities, direct access to any medical records relevant to the 
study for verification of study -related procedures and data. Direct access includes examining, 
analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to the evaluation 
of the study.  
Investigators will obtain authorization from the subject to permit acce ss to study -related records, 
including personal information.  
Authorization is required from each subject ( e.g., specific permission granted by [CONTACT_325709] a covered entity for the use or disclosure of an individual's protected health information). The 
investigator and institution must obtain such waiver/authorization in writing from the subject. 
Valid authorization must meet the implementation specifications under the applicable privacy 
laws. Authorization may be combined in the ICF (approved by [CONTACT_36985]/ IEC), or it may be a 
separate document (approved by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC) or provided by [CONTACT_76617] 
(without IRB/ IEC approval).  
14.[ADDRESS_771880]’s visit to the study site , the investigator or qualified designee will record 
progress notes in the subject’s medical record to document all significant observation s. At a 
minimum, these notes will contain the following:  
• Documentation of the informed consent process, including any revised consents.  
• The date of the visit and the corresponding visit or day in the study schedule.  
• General subject status remarks, includin g any significant medical findings. The severity,

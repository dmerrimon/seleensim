Safety:  
During the trial, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_18985]:  
• Physical examination , including review of the major body systems, height, and weight  
• Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and 
oxygen saturation  
• Standard 12 -lead ECG  
• Laboratory parameters (including hematology, serum biochemistry, uri nalysis, and 
urine/serum pregnancy testing)  
• All A Es occurring after the subject signs the informed consent form and up to the last 
trial visit will be recorded  
Efficacy:  
The key secondary  efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in awake cough frequency 
(cough count/duration of measurement  [hours ]). For each treatment period, baseline is the 
cough frequency during the recorder assessment just prior to initiation of  investigational 
product . Though summaries will be presented for cough frequencies, due to the skewed 
nature of the data, a log transformation will be used prior to statistical analyses.  
Statistical Methods : 
 
 
 
 
Allowing for a reduction in power due to subject withdrawals, approximately 
[ADDRESS_17842]. Period  specific  baselines will be included as covariates. The 
secondary efficacy endpoint change from b aseline in 24 -hour cough frequency will be 
analyzed using the same methods described for the key secondary efficacy endpoint.  

  
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.   Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX -629-CC-[ADDRESS_17843] 
and corresponding 95% confidence interva l using a similar model to that described for awake 
cough frequency. Cough frequency endpoints will be analyzed on the natural log scale.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_18986], in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities coding dictionary. Safety variables will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3148].  
All statistical testing will be at the 5% level of significance (2 -sided) and all point estimates 
for the  comparison between treatment groups will be accompanied by 2 -sided 95% 
confidence intervals.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be the primary analysis population for efficacy. All 
safety analyses will be based upon the safety set , i.e., all subjec ts who receive at least 1  dose 
of trial treatment.  
Statistical methods will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan, which will govern  any 
statistical language within the protocol .

Patients who present to a physician for a persistent cough are evaluated and treated for common 
causes of cough. Patients who continue to cough  are evaluated for conditions that are 
commonly associated with chronic cough , such as asthma, gastroesophageal r eflux disease 
(GERD), and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) ( Dicpi[INVESTIGATOR_18964] , 2011; Morice  et al., 2006). 
A patient may be evaluated for less common diseases based on the ir history, other symptoms, 
or physical findings. Patients in whom no treatable cause of their cough can be found are 
characterized as having “refractory chronic cough” ( Gibson  et al. , 2016).  
The prevalence of chronic cough is estimated to affect 11 % to 13% of the population ( Ford 
et al., 2006; Song  et al. , 2014). Patients are most commonly women aged  between [ADDRESS_17857] on quality of life  as measured by [CONTACT_18989] (LCQ) ( Birring  et al. , 2003 b). The disabling effects 
of chronic cough are understandable, given that patients with the condition cough hundreds or 
even thousands of times per day for months to years  (Smith  et al. , 2016).  
There is a significant proportion of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough who 
do not respond to treatment of the underlying disease or do not have an underlying condition 
identified. Treatment options for these patients are very limited ( Morice  et al. , 2006). P atients 
and clinicians will frequently try over -the-counter agents such as dextromethorphan, 
guaifenesin, and antihistamines with little benefit. Prescription options in the [LOCATION_002] of 
America ( [LOCATION_003]) include benzonatate, codeine and related opi[INVESTIGATOR_18965]. Over -the-counter 
antitussive products that contain antihistamine or dextromethorphan are also widely used for 
cough, but these compounds have limited efficacy.  
3.2 ADX -629 Background  
Reactive aldehyde species (RASP) such as 4 -hydroxynonenal and malondia ldehyde (MDA) 
are toxic mediators of the mammalian immune system and are implicated in numerous disease 
states. The Sponsor has developed ADX -629, a proprietary new chemical entity for the 
treatment of chronic diseases with inflammatory and immune -mediated  components, including 
psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  (NASH) , acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_18966], Inc.   Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX -629-CC-001 
  Version 2.0, 16 June 2022

syndrome, and other diseases thought to be caused or exacerbated by [CONTACT_18990].  
ADX -629 is a small molecule formulate d for oral administration that binds rapi[INVESTIGATOR_18967] y to RASP, thus preventing RASP -mediated inflammation and other toxicities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to nonclinical safety studies, Phase  1 safety testing has been conducted in 
85 healthy human volunteers in a single ascending dose (SAD) trial and a multiple ascending 
dose (MAD) trial. In the SAD trial, 41 subjects received ADX -629 and 13  subjects received 
placebo across all cohorts. In the MAD trial, 23 subjects received ADX -629 and 8  subjects 
received placebo across all cohorts. Overall, ADX -629 was found to be safe and well tolera ted 
at the doses explored, including the maximum dos e of 600  mg twice daily ( BID). The adverse 
event (AE) profile of ADX -629 was favorable compared to placebo. A total of 6  subjects  
(9.4%) who receiv ed ADX -629 (up to 600 mg BID ) had treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) compared to 4  subjects  (19.1%) wh o received placebo. None of the subjects had 
treatment interrupt ed or discontinu ed trial drug in the MAD trial.

Although PK variability was observed, a linear correlation was evident in maximum plasma 
concentration ( Cmax) and exposure (area under the plasma concentration -time curve [AUC])  
with increasing dose. The half -life was consistent across doses  and days, with mean values in 
multiple day exposures ranging between 3.49  and 6.83 hours, supportive of BID 
administration. Little to no accumulation of the drug was seen across all doses . A Cmax of 
790 ng/mL (approximately 4 µM) and an AUC 0-12 of 3400  h*ng/mL is anticipated given the 
Day 10 exposure at 300 mg BID (extrapolated from 600  mg BID at steady state) . This exposure 
is expected to yield  an adequat e molar ratio to achieve stoichiometric efficacy against elevated 
RASP. A decrease in free MDA levels was observed in the plasma of healthy volunteers over 
10 days of dosing with ADX -629 600  mg BID that was statistically significantly greater than 
that of subjects treated with placebo. Following ingestion of a high -fat meal on Day  10 of 
dosing with 600  mg BID or placebo, levels of free fatty acids were statistically lower and levels 
of high-density  lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were statistically significan tly higher in 
drug-treated subjects than in placebo -treated subjects, potentially representing additional anti -
inflammatory activity of ADX -629. 
3.3 Trial  Rationale  
Chronic cough has been associated with autoimmune disease ( Birring  et al. , 2003 a). By 
[CONTACT_18991] -self-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] , RASP is associated with 
autoantibody formation ( Thiele  et al. , 2015). In addition, chronic cough may be potentiated by 
[CONTACT_18992]1 receptor ( Long  et al. , 2019), which is modulated by [CONTACT_18993] ( Trevisani  et al., 
2007). Preliminary evidence also suggests that RASP is elevated in the sputum of patients with 
chronic cough (personal communication, Brian Day, Ph .D., National Jewish Medical Center) 
relative to control subjects. Thus, RASP inhibition could represent a novel approach for the 
treatment of  chronic cough.  
3.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
The ADX -629-CC-001 clinical trial  will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
ADX -629 in subjects with refractory  or unexplained  chronic cough. The background and 
rationale detailed above suggests that su bjects may benefit  from treatment with ADX -629. 
Safety of the clinical dosing regimen in this trial is supported by a Phase  1 clinical trial in 
healthy volunteers and a number of nonclinical toxicology and PK studies in which no serious 
safety concerns were noted at the projected therapeutic doses in man.  
ADX -629 was well tolerated in healthy human volunteers at doses of up to 600  mg BID (the 
maximum dose tested) for 10  days. The AE profile of ADX -629 in the SAD/MAD studies was 
favorable compare d to placebo: a total of 6  subjects (9.4%) who received ADX -629 had 
TEAEs, compared to 4  subjects (19.1%) who received placebo. There were no interruptions or 
discontinuations of trial drug administration  with subjects receiving multiple doses . More

• Trial  treatment must be discontinued in s ubjects who become pregnant in the trial. The pregnancy 
will be reported and followed up as per guidance in (see Section 8.3.2 ). However, the subject should 
still undergo relevant post -randomization procedures and visits if possible and safe to do so.  
• Investigator's decision that it is not in the best interest of the subject  to continue.  
• Lost to follow -up: The subject stopped coming to the investigative site for visits, and trial personnel 
were unable to contact [CONTACT_423] . 
Immediate safety concern s should be discussed with the S ponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the subject  should continue or discontinue trial treatment . 
If possible, an early termination  visit should be conducted ( i.e., procedures for the end of Treatment Period  1 
Visit  4 or Treatment Period  2 Visit  8). The subject  will be permanently discontinued from the trial treatment  
but will continue to be observed for AEs, if possible, until the scheduled end-of-trial visit  (Visit  10). 
If the subject  withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue 
to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a subject  withdraws from the trial, they may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and 
the Investigator must document this in the investigative site trial records.  
Lost to Follow -up: 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits and are 
unable to be contact[CONTACT_18996]. The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to 
participate in  a required trial visit:  
• The investigative site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_18997]. They should counsel the subject  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether the subject  wishes to or should conti nue in the trial. 
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the I nvestigator or designee must make every effort to 
regain contact [CONTACT_1155]  (where possible, 3  telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter 
to the subjec t's last known mail ing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_18998] t's medical record.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, they will be considered to have withdrawn from the 
trial. 
6.6 Replacement Policy  
Subjects who discontinue or are withdrawn from the trial before taking any  trial treatment  may be replaced 
with Sponsor approval.

placebo in Treatment Period  1 and ADX -629 in Treatment Period  2. Within each treatment period, subjects 
will receive their allocated tr eatment for 2  weeks.  
The randomization schedule will be produced by . The treatment will be  allocated via a web -based 
electronic data capture system.  
7.3.2 Blinding and Unblinding Procedures  
This is a double -blind  clinical trial . Treatment assi gnments w ill be blinded to the I nvestigator, subjects , and 
all the clinical and research staff. The trial blind will not be broken until the clinical trial is completed and 
after the database has been locked.  
, is the  
randomization system in use for this trial. Blinded kit allocation to eligible subjects will be  managed by 
[CONTACT_19000] (randomization and resupply).  
During th e trial, the randomization code must not be broken except in emergency situations where the  
identification of a subject js trial treatmen t is required by [CONTACT_19001] I nvestigator for further management 
of the subject’s condition . The qualified I nvestigato r (Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_18970]-Investigator ) 
will unblind the subject ’s treatment using  the unblinding module. In case of  emergency in 
which  neither the P rincipal Investigator nor the s ub-Investigator  are available, the Medical Monitor may,  
as a last resort , perform  the unblinding using  the  unblinding module . In any case of 
unblinding, t he date , time,  and reason for breaking the  blind will be recorded, and the Sponsor and Medical 
Monitor wi ll be notified. This information will be stored  in the subject’s source files with as few of the 
investigative site staff unblinded as is clinically reasonable.

unused trial treatment . Subjects who exhibit poor compliance , i.e., not 100% compliant without adequate 
explanation,  should be counsel ed on the  importance of good compliance with the dosing regimen.  Severe 
lack of compliance is defined as <80% or >120% of the correct dosing and  is a reason for discontinuation 
of the subject from the trial (Section  6.5).

8. TRIAL  ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 Assessment of Efficacy  
8.1.1 Key Secondary  Efficacy Assessment  
Objective cough counts  measured as 24 -hour sound recordings using a custom -built digital recording 
device. The key secondary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in awake cough frequency, 
calculated as the (total cough count whil e awake)/(duration awake)  and expressed in hours . For each 
treatment period, baseline is the cough frequency during the recorder assessment just prior to initiation of  
investigational product . 
8.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Secondary efficacy assessment s are: 
• The change from baseline in 24 -hour cough frequency will be assessed from the same 24 -hour cough 
monitoring used to measure awake cough frequency.  
• Cough severity measured using a 100  mm VAS. Subjects will be asked to rate their cough severity 
over the previous  2 weeks at screening , and over the previous  24 hours  at other timepoints . 
• Global rating of change scores for cough frequency and severity . 
• Patient Global Impression of Change: A rating scale completed by [CONTACT_19005]. It consists of a 7 -point scale ranging from 
“very much improved ” to “very much worse .” 
• Clinician Global Impress ion of Change : A rating scale completed by I nvestigators to assess the 
subject's response to the trial treatment.  It consists of a 7 -point scale ranging from ‘very much 
improved ’ to “very much worse .” 
• Quality of life will be assessed using the LCQ, which i s a cough -specific assessment  (Birring  et al. , 
2003b) . The LCQ comprises three, 7 -point domain scores: physical, psychological, and social. A 
higher score indicates a better quality of life.  
• Quality of life will be  further be assessed using the CQLQ.

be reported. SAEs will be reported to the regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs )/Research Ethics Boards ( REB s) according to local regulations and  will be followed  up until the 
event is resolved or stabili zed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship to this treatment. An AE 
can therefo re be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related 
to the treatment administered.  
An SAE is defined as  any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, or  
• Is life -threatening, i.e., the subject  was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event, or  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18973], or  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; or 
• Is an important medical event, i.e., may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18974] m ay require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are : bronchospasms requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home , blood dyscrasias , or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]. Dev elopment of cancer, drug dependency , or drug abuse are most often considered 
as SAEs.  
The following are not considered to be SAEs:  
• Any elective procedures that require admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18975] ( e.g., angioplasty) pla nned prior to signing the inform consent form, unless the 
underlying condition has worsened or the procedure results in a worsening of the subject’s 
condition. Such conditions should be recorded in the subject’s medical history.  
• A visit to an emergency room  or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18976] <24  hours that does not result in 
admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18977] a life -
threatening event. These should be recorded as AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 49 of 68 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be collected with a non -leading question at each visit: “Have you experienced any 
change in  your health or in your general condition since  your last visit?” as well as by [CONTACT_19006] . Clearly related signs, symptoms , and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures should preferably be gro uped together and recorded as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
whenever possible. Intensity (mild, moderate , or severe) and relationship to trial treatment ( related or 
unrelated ) as well as action taken, seriousness and outcome should be recorded in the AE p age of eCRF. 
Start and end date and time of the event will also be recorded  as precisely as possible.  
Abnormal laboratory values or vital signs abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are medically 
relevant, i.e., symptomatic, requiring correc tive treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfil l a criterion 
for an SAE.  
In the case of chronic disease, if the disease is known and documented when the subject  enters the trial, 
only worsening (increased frequency or intensity of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) will b e documented as an AE.  
Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as determined 
by [CONTACT_19007]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship 
to trial procedures or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
•  
 
  
 
 
  
 
Relationship to Trial  Treatment  
Assessment of causality is based on the following considerations: associative connections (time or place), 
pharmacological explanations, previous knowledge of the drug, presence of cha racteristic clinical or 
pathological phenomena, exclusion of other causes, or absence of alternative explanations.  
The I nvestigator will assess the causal relationship to the trial treatment according to the following 
classifications:  
• Definite:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time 
relationship to drug administration and which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19008], Inc.  Clinical Trial  Protocol: ADX -629-CC-001 
  Version 2.0, 16 June 2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 50 of 68 
drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (de -challenge) should be  clinically 
plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically using a 
satisfactory re -challenge (the drug is readministered to determine if the same reaction occurs) 
procedure if necessary.  
• Probable:  A clinical event, includin g laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time 
relationship to drug administration and which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (de -challenge) should be clinically 
plausible.  
• Possible:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence 
to the drug administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_19010]. Information on drug withdrawal may b e lacking or unclear.  
• Unlikely (“Not related”): A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other 
drugs, chemicals or underlying dise ase provide plausible explanations.  
• Not related:  Any event that does not meet the above criteria; there is sufficient information that 
etiology of the event is in no relation to the trial treatment . 
Action Taken  with Investigational Product  
The I nvestigator will be asked to record action taken in relation to the trial or trial treatment and to other 
treatments. The categories in relation to the trial or trial treatment are:  
• No action taken  
• Investigational product dose reduced  
• Investigational product discontinued temporarily  
• Investigational product discontinued permanently  
• Not applicable  
Outcome  
The I nvestigator will be asked to record the outcome by [CONTACT_19011]:  
• Recovered  
• Recovering  
• Not recovered  
• Recovered with sequelae  
• Unknown  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious and Significant Adverse Events

expected from the information provided in the Investigator Brochure) and serious. ADX -[ADDRESS_17897] complete and submit an SAE report for all SAEs, regardless of the causal relationship 
to trial treatm ent as soon as possible, in any case within 24  hours of having received information on the 
event. The initial report can be followed by a f ollow -up report as soon as the I nvestigator obtains more 
specific information on the event. Every effort should be ma de to document further any SAE that is fatal or 
life-threatening  within 1  week (7  days) after the initial notification.  
The I nvestigator must also send (preferably by e mail or fax ) copi[INVESTIGATOR_18978], to , the Sponsor’s representative:  
 
 
 
Laboratory reference ranges should be included for all laboratory results.  
Care should be taken to ensure that the subject 's identity is protected and the subjec t's identifiers in the 
clinical trial are not included on any copy of source documents provided to the Sponsor.  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions are subject to expedited reporting to the Regulatory 
Authorities and IRB /REB  as appropriate. Investigators will be notified by [CONTACT_19013] r IRB /REB . Investigators should provide written 
documentation of IRB/ REB  notification for each report to the Sponsor or . The Sponsor or 
 will ensure that the appropriate regulatory authorities are notified of all reportable SAEs.  
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representative may make expedited reports of all SAEs that are expected and 
causally related to the IP to the Competent Authorities, according to local regulations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Discontinuation  Due to Adverse Events  
The onset of an AE is not necessari ly a reason for premature withdrawal  from the trial or for temporary or 
permanent discontinuation  of trial treatment. If the I nvestigator decides to discontinue trial treatment 
permanently because of an AE, this must be documented in the eCRF.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The I nvestigator must ensure that follow -up of the subject  is appropriate to the nature of the event, and that 
it continues until resolution or until agreed with the Sponsor.  
The I nvestigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subject s. In particular , he 
or she should follow -up the outcome of any AEs until they return to normal,  or the subject ’s condition 
stabili zes. 
If the  Investigator learns of an SAE during the [ADDRESS_17898] ’s final trial visit and if the 
Investigator considers the SAE to be causally related to the IP, this should be reported to the Sponsor within 
[ADDRESS_17899] be discontinued,  and the Sponsor informed immediately ( i.e., within 
1 working day).  
Pregnancy in a female trial subject, or in a female partner of a male trial subject, during the trial period or 
within [ADDRESS_17900], the procedure for reporting SAEs 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be followed.

Deviations from the protocol will be categorized as “minor ” or “major ” in cooperation with the Sponsor. 
Devia tions will be assessed regularly and finalized prior to database lock.  
10.1.3  Analysis Population Definitions  
The following analysis populations will be presented:  
• Screened Population : All subjects who sign the ICF. 
• Randomized Population : All subjects who are ran domized.  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population : All randomized subjects . 
• Safety Population : All subjects who receive at least one dose of trial treatment.  
• Per protocol (PP) Population : All subjects in the ITT Population  who do not violate inclusion or 
exclusion criteria or deviate from the protocol, in a way that could influence their efficacy 
assessment. As this trial has a crossover design, subject inclusion in this set will be considered for 
all periods . 
All safety ana lyses will be based upon the Safety Population . Subjects will be analyzed by [CONTACT_19017].  
The ITT Population will be the primary analysis population for efficacy. Subjects will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_19018]. The PP set will be used for a sens itivity analysis of the efficacy data.  
 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Trial  Protocol: ADX -629-CC-[ADDRESS_17904] been verified , coded  if necessary, and entered into the database, a review will be 
performed. The purpose of this review will be to define the analysis sets. The review will also check the 
quality of the data, identify outliers, and make decisions on how to deal with any data issues ( e.g., missing 
values, withdrawals, protocol deviations). After the pre -analysis review, resolution of all issues and 
documentation of all decisions, the database wi ll be locked.  
10.2 General Considerations  
10.2.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses for the key secondary  efficacy endpoint  (awake  cough 
frequency ) can be expressed as:  
H0: µADX = µPLA 
H1: µADX ≠ µPLA 
where µADX and µPLA are the mean changes from baseline in cough frequency for ADX -629 and placebo 
respectively.  
All statistical testing will be at the 5% level of significance (2 -sided) and all point estimates for the 
comparison between treatment groups will be accompanied b y 2-sided 95% confidence intervals.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_17905] withdrawals approximately 50  subjects will be 
randomized.  
10.2.3  Data Summaries  
All endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_6982]. Baseline data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_19019].  
Continuous dat a will be summarized using descriptive statistics ( e.g., mean and standard deviation) and 
categorical data will be summarized using frequency tables (counts and percentages).

10.3 Demographics, Baseline Characteristics and Concomitant Medications  
Demographics, baseline characteristics, medical history and prior medication data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_19016] (and overall) and, if some subjects withdraw from the trial prior to Treatment Period  2, 
by [CONTACT_1570], using the safety set. Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_19020] ( WHODrug ) preferred name, ATC class , and treatment group.  
The most current version of the WHODrug and Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) 
coding dictionaries will be used for the concomitant medications and medical histories , respectively.  
10.4 Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be assessed through tablet counts and will be summarized by [CONTACT_19021].  
10.5 Analysis of Safety Data  
No imputation will be used for handling missing data, with the exception of conservative approaches taken 
for missing AE information ( e.g., intensity). Details of such conventions will be documented in the SAP.  
TEAE s will be summarized by [CONTACT_19022], in accordance 
with the MedDRA coding dictionary. Safety variables will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3148] . The 
number of subjects reporting each AE preferred term will  be tabulated for all TEAEs and separately for 
those considered as at least possibly related to trial treatment by [CONTACT_737].  
Changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG data will be summarized by [CONTACT_19023] t. Baseline will be taken as the last measurement prior to dosing within the specific trial 
period.  
10.6 Analysis of Efficacy Data  
Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in awake cough fr equency (cough 
count/duration of measurement  [hour] ). For each treatment period, baseline is the cough frequency during 
the recorder assessment just prior to initiation of IP.  Though summaries will be presented for cough 
frequencies, due to the skewed nature of the data, a log transformation will be used prior to statistical 
analyses.  
A mixed -effect model suitable for the crossover design will be used to make comparisons betwee n the 
two treatment groups in the changes from baseline of the natural log data. The model will include fixed 
effects for treatment sequence, period , treatment, and subject nested within treatment sequence as a random 
effect . Period specific baselines will  be included as covariates.  
If there are any zero cough frequencies within the data,  all values will have 0.1 added to their cough 
frequency (equates to 1 cough every 10  hours) prior to transforming the data.

The mean change from baseline (on the log scale) will be presented for each treatment group and the 
difference between treatment group means will be presented, along with associated standard errors and 95% 
confidence intervals. The mean changes from baseline will be back -transformed to estimate th e ratio 
comparison to baseline for each treatment group and the difference between treatment groups will be back -
transformed to estimate the ratio comparison to baseline for the ADX -629 group adjusted for placebo. All 
ratios will be accompanied by [CONTACT_19024] 95% confidence intervals  and p -values.  
Using a mixed -effect model is suitable when assuming missing data is missing at random. Alternative 
sensitivity analyses may be performed assessing the impact of any missing data on the interpretation of t he 
results. These analyses will be detailed in the SAP.  
All model assumptions will be checked by [CONTACT_19025]. If the evaluation of residuals 
indicates a problem with the model assumptions, an alternative transformation of the data or non -parametric 
analyses may be considered.  
The secondary efficacy endpoint change from baseline in 24 -hour cough frequency will be analy zed using 
the same methods described for the key secondary efficacy endpoint.  
The changes from baseline in cough severity VAS  scores and quality  of life (evaluated with CQLQ) will 
be analy zed using a similar approach except  that the scores w ill not be log transformed prior to analysis. 
Hence, mean changes from baseline will be presented , and the treatment effect will be the difference 
between the mean changes from baseline. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p -values will 
be presented.  
Other efficacy endpoints will be summarized and analyzed to estimate the treatment effect an d 
corresponding 95% confidence interval  using a similar model to that described for awake cough frequency. 
Cough frequency endpoints will be analyzed on the natural log scale.  Full details of analyses will be 
provided in the SAP , which will govern  any statistical language within the protocol . 
10.7 Interim Analysis

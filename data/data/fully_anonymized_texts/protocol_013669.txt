I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:   
 
Nine months ago, SARS-CoV -[ADDRESS_912526] risk for morbidity and 
mortality from COVID -19, with adults aged 65 and older accounting for 25% of cases but 80% of 
deaths. However, many healthy middle-aged adults without underlying risk factors  also 
experience severe disease, likely driven by a profound and exaggerated inflammatory response. 
Those who develop severe COVID -19 with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) often 
require prolonged mechanical ventilation with prone positioning to m aintain adequate 
oxygenation. In contrast to most other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_912527] with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11530] (including rehabilitation providers) due to infectivity and 
shortages of adequate personal protective equip ment. These critically ill patients experience 
more severe disease, are exposed to even more sedation and neuromyotoxic agents, which, in turn, are associated with poor long-term outcomes. Even patients with less severe COVID -[ADDRESS_912528]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] r ehabilitation with ‘stay -at-
home’ restrictions and the stress and uncertainty of a more extended global pandemic.  
Our overarching hypothesis is that both healthy middle-aged and older adults with 
multimorbidity who experience the ‘accelerated aging’ effects of profound inflammation 
associated with COVID -19 will experience significant ongoing physical and 
neuropsychological impairment (Aim 1 of parent grant, approved th rough COM IRB 20 -
0703 and COMIRB 20- 0690).  Novel, scalable interventions that can overcome m any of the 
barriers imposed by [CONTACT_4113] -19 are urgently needed to reverse physical and 
neuropsychological impairments and prevent the long-term functional consequences 
(Aim 2 of parent grant, described in this protocol).  We will investigate this hypothesis  
through the following aim:  
 
Aim: Investigate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a multicomponent tele-rehabilitation 
program during COVID -19 recovery.  
Hypothesis  A: Tele-rehabilitation is  safe and feasible. We anticipate that no injuries will occur , 
≤20% of telehealth sessions will experience technical difficulties, ≥50% of participants will adhere to the exercise program, and ≥50% of participants will use the Platform between face-to-face online sessions.  w COMIRB Protocol

 Hypothesis B: Participation in tele-rehabi litation improves physical function (measured by [ADDRESS_912529]) compared with controls.   
This study will contribute immediately to our knowledge of the course of recovery for survivors of 
COVID -19 and will advance the feasibility of t ele-rehabi litation as a more generally useful 
intervention in patients lacking access (distance, availability, mobility) to standard rehabilitative services. Overall, development of effective tele-rehabilitation programs as alternatives to delivering rehab ilitatio n to populations lacking access could transform the way in which we 
deliver acute rehabilitation and post- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675156].  
 II. Background and Significance:  
 Significance of the proposed research centers on: 1) the recent COVID -19 pandemic that 
has unknown impacts on long-term health among patients who survive the disease; and 
2) the need to deliver care to patients who are recovering from COVID-[ADDRESS_912530] identified as causing severe infection (COVID-19) 
in December 2019.  COVID -19 appears to be associated with greater mortality, thromboembolic 
disease, and a cute resp iratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared with usual seasonal 
viruses.[ADDRESS_912531]-COVID decline in lung function and longer -term physical function 
impairments.4,5 Further, some patients with COVID -19 require ad mission t o the intensive care 
unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation, both of which have negative impact on health outcomes. Health outcomes following COVID-[ADDRESS_912532]-Intensive Care 
Syndrome (PI[INVESTIGATOR_45599]) impacts and is associated with marked reductions in health-related quality of life, inability to return to work, increased healthcare utilization, and premature death.

effects of critical illness and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], placing patients at increased risk for 
adverse neuropsychological outcomes. Indeed, survivors of other novel respi[INVESTIGATOR_675158] s severe i llness11,17,18 or than the general

Need to Deliver Care to Patients Recovering from COVID-19 with Physical Distanc ing or in 
Quarantine 
The unprecedented factors associated with care delivery in patients with COVID -19 require 
novel approaches for rehabilitation. Virtual services may be a viable alternative for rehabilitation delivery. Tele-rehabilitation in the outpati ent setti ng allows patients to access rehabilitative 
services in their preferred environment, potentially improving adherence and tolerability of long-
term therapy. However, at the time of grant submission, t here were  no published studies using 
tele-rehabi litation services following a critical care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675159] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) developi[INVESTIGATOR_528153] -disciplinary telehealth strategies in addition to in-person 
care following a diagnosis of PI[INVESTIGATOR_675160]. Ac cessing in-p erson 
services immediately following COVID -19, however, will not be possible for many discharged 
patients due to personal quarantine requirements or other household contacts with COVID -19. 
Even following the quarantine period, in-person rehabil itation may not be feasible due to 
limitations imposed by [CONTACT_675197], closure of outpatient facilities, limited 
personnel, ongoing mobility limitations, need for institutionalized care, or fear of triggering 
memories associated with hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_675161].  Tele-
rehabilitation has not been as widely implemented as telemedicine because of the need for hands-on interventions and concerns regarding safety during activities.
[ADDRESS_912536] of COVID -19, but also facilitate 
future applications to other populations (e.g., rural, mobility -restricted, low resource settings). 
This study proposes to develop these means through innovative applications of existing tele-
rehabilitation technology.  
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
Preliminary Data 
As of May  11, 2020, when the NIH proposal was submitted, 19,879 persons in Colorado had 
been diagnosed with COVID -19, with the majority (>70%) of those cases occurring in the 
Denver Metropolitan Area. Over 3600 persons ha d been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (50% ≥ 60 years) and 987 
had died (91% ≥60 years) as per data from the Colorado Department of Public Health.  As the

CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_912537] academic and tertiary care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675162], the University of 
Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (UCH) has cared for a large proportion of these patients.  
Investigative Team Experience  
Our research team includes cross -disciplinary expertise in Infectious Diseases, Geriatrics, 
Critical Care Medicine, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation, and Statistics, and leverages both rich previous collaborative experien ces and innovative new collaborations to enable success. 
Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_675163] a clinical researcher and physician in infectious diseases with additional 
training in gerontology who has experience in implementing exercise interventions in vulnerable 
older adul ts with HIV (R01AG066562, K23AG050260), in implementing electronic consultations 
(U01HL142103) and validating electronic disability assessments (R21 AG062380) for older 
adults, and in longitudinal physical function assessments related to statin therapy (R01AG054366).  PI [INVESTIGATOR_675164] -Lapsley has more than 20 years of clinical research experience in 
working with medically complex patients and interdisciplinary teams in implementing 
rehabilitation programs (NIH R01 NR016209, VA RR&D I21 RX002054, VA RR&D I01 
RX00 1978, NIH R01 HD065900, NIH R03 AR054538, NIH K23 AG029978, and NIH R01

 IV. Research Methods 
 
Justification for changes:   
Given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_675166], we have subsequently made some changes to the design of the study  that will improve the quality and rigor of the science and allow for more 
robust comparisons. T he NIH allows for changes in design that improve the quality and rigor of 
the science. Notably, we have added a control group (n=15) that will receive a tablet with 
standard guidelines for exerc ise following COVID -19 infection and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the Platform 
(for testing only) and a Fitbit activity monitor, but not any formal tele-rehabilitati on. To collect 
safety data and encourage retention, a research assistant will contact [CONTACT_675198] 
1x/week over the course of the intervention (12 weeks). The intervention group (n=30) will 
receive care as described herein. Therefore, the total projected sample size for this study  will be 
[ADDRESS_912538] evaluation of the v alue of tele-rehabilitation sessions  combined with 
biobehavioral interventions. We will still be able to compare both the intervention and control groups described to a no-treatment sample that is followed as part of COMIRB 20-0703. We  
therefore believe the proposed changes are justified to improve the quality of the science and the comparisons/conclusions we will be able to make from these data.  
 
Research Design and Methods 
 
Protocol Template Page 6 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 For this rehabilitation pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], individuals from  a separate ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_274376] -up study (COMIRB 20-
0703)  who are [ADDRESS_912539]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_675167]  (Co-Investig ators).  Participants will 
also be recruited via HIPAA A and COMIRB approved flyers in Colorado. I ndividuals who 
consent to participate will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group in a 2:1 
ratio; randomization will be stratified based on age (<55 and ≥55), length of mechanical 
ventilation (<5 days, ≥ 5 days), and gender . The App-Facilitated Tele-Rehabilitation (AFTER) 
program involves tele-rehabilitation del ivered in individual formats with biobehavioral 
interventions to augment adherence and recovery. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group 
allocation within the AFTER program .  
 
A.  Outcome Measure(s):   
 Data Collection and Outcomes .  
Outcomes, unless specified otherwise, will be collected at baseline, week 6  (primary endpoint), 
week 12, and week 26. Baseli ne testing will occ ur following the pre-session to set up the 
Platform and prior to the Physical Therapy Evaluation (session 1). The primary functional 
outcome for Hypothesi s B (30” chair stand test) will be collected through the Platform (more 
details bel ow). Eac h test session will include the standardized procedures described in the next 
sections. Importantly, all test sessions will  occur in the parti cipant’s home and when possible, be 
facilitated via the Platform  and verified concurrently by a trained outcomes ass essor who 
oversees the testing remotely .  
Feasibility ( Hypothesis  A) will be measured by [CONTACT_675199], defined as the number of 
session s attended divided by [CONTACT_675200] (n=12). Individual s will be 
considered adher ent if they attend at least 75% (9 visits) of the total sessions. Secondary 
adherence will be measured by [CONTACT_675201] (n= 60 [5x/12 weeks ]), with adherence defined by [CONTACT_37142] ≥ 
75% (45 sessions)  of prescribed sessions. System Usability Scale (SUS)  will be collected at 
program end only. The SUS is a 10-item survey that uses a 5-point Likert scale  (Strongly 
disagree (1) to Strongly agree (5)). Scores range from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate better 
usability. It is a valid scale and is frequently used by [CONTACT_675202]. Safety  
will also be measured as a marker of fea sibility. Safety events will be categorized and counted; 
safety events will be collected during each session and through the diary feature on the 
Platform. Additionally, falls will be graded using the Falls -Grading Scale.83 The scale ranges 
from 1 to 4; a grade of 1 is defined as a near fall, grade 2 is a fall that does not receive medical attention, grade 3 is a fall that requires medical attention but no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], and grade 4 is a fall resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Al l the aforementioned outcomes will be collected in the 
intervention group, and only safety will be collected in the control group.  
Initial efficacy for change in physical function will be measured by [CONTACT_941] 30” Chair Stand Test 
(Hypothesis  B primary outcome) . The 30” Chair Stand Test requires only a standard height chair 
(approximately 45cm) and can be visualized on video. The test requires the participant to stand up and sit down as many times as possible in [ADDRESS_912540] each time he/she stands. Further, the test will also be facilitated by [CONTACT_675203]. The 30” Chair Stand Test is responsive to chang e. Initial efficacy for behavior change will be assessed by [CONTACT_675204], PROMIS Short Form (SF) v1.0 General Self-Efficacy 4a, and PROMIS Short Form 
(SF) v1.0 Self- Efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions . Average Daily Step Count (per week) 
Protocol Template Page 7 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 will be collected via Fitbit. The PROMIS SF v1.0 General Self-Efficacy 4a  was developed from 
the NIH self-efficacy scale, and the short form consists of 4 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale 
[I am not at all confident (1) to I am very confident (5)].[ADDRESS_912541], MRC dyspnea, and 
activities -specific balance confidence (ABC) scale to identify and monitor fall risk. The PROMIS  
Scale v1.2 Global Health will be used to measure quality of life; a higher score is indicative of 
better quality of life. The 3-Item Loneliness scale will be used to assess loneliness. T he Patient 
Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ8)  will be used to measure depression; a higher score indicates 
increased severity of depressive symptoms.  All the aforementioned outcomes will be collected 
in both groups .  
The following is specific to data collected through the Platform:  
In addition to the data regarding comorbidities  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675168] 20 -0690 and 20-0703, data will be collected through 
the P latform .  The Platform can track usage data, results from tests and measures, and health 
information. Usage data will be used to monitor and describe adherence to prescribed activities (e.g., Home  exercise program, learning modules). It will also be used to collect the following 
outcomes: 30” Chair Stand Test, Timed Up-and-Go test, 4-stage balance test, system usability 
scale, activities -specific balance confidence (ABC) scale, and the PROMIS Scale v1.2 Global 
Health. While participants will be encouraged to use the Platform for this data collection since it 
is part of our feasibility outcome, alternatives will be provided for the main testing points (baseline, week 6, week 12and week 26) to achiev e complete data collection. Through the 
health diary feature, participants will be encouraged to log data pertaining to but not limited to medical history (medications, comorbidities), smoking status, demographics (age, gender, height, weight), and health e vents ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], injury, fall). This data entry is optional 
and completed via self-report. Any data entered into the Platform will be accessible by [CONTACT_5051]. The participant’ s name [CONTACT_675214], and 
once a participant is enrolled, he/she will be assigned a login/password such as 
“Telerehab_P01” to indicate telerehabilitation study and participant 01; the initial account 
password is randomly generated through Blue Marble’s webapp.   
 
B. Description of P opulation to be Enrolled:

Participants wi ll be consented either face to face or via remote e-consent.   Participants who 
consent remotely will be provided an e-consent via REDCap.  The e-consent will be available to 
the participant prior to the consent discussion.  A qualified study team member will Zoom 
phone/video call the potential participant.  The potential participant will verify their ident ity.  The 
study team member will explain the consent process and that the participant can navigate 
forward and backward through the consent form pages and that they may return to the form  
later if they want time to think about their participation.  The stu dy team  member will read the 
consent form with the participant and will answer all questions that the participant has.  The 
participant and the study team  member will both sign and date the consent form and the 
participant will be able to download or emai l themselves a copy of the signed form.   
 
C. Study Design and Research Methods   
Participants will be recruited from COMIRB 20-0703 and via HIPAA A throughout Colorado. 
 Procedures  will include 
Virtual assessments inc lude:  
1) 30” Chair Stand Test (Primary O utcome). The 30” Chair Stand Test requires only a standard 
height chair (approximately 45cm) and can be visualized on video. The test requires the participant to stand up and sit down as many times as possible in [ADDRESS_912545] 
each time he/she stands. Further, the test will also be facilitated by  [CONTACT_675203]. The 30” Chair 
Stand Test is responsive to c hange.  
 
2) Timed Up -and-Go (TUG) Test: The TUG test measures the time it takes for a person to rise 
from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Patients are 
aske d to walk as quickly but as safely as they can. 
 
3) 4-stage balance test: The 4-stage balance test mea sures static balance in 4 different 
positions (narrow base of support, semi -tandem, tandem, and single-leg). The test is facilitated 
by [CONTACT_941] P latform ; it requires participants to hold each position for up to [ADDRESS_912546] position is not performed 
(e.g. if participant unable to hold semi -tandem for [ADDRESS_912547] stops , and tandem 
and single-leg stance are not assessed). The 4- stage balance test is indicative of fall risk .  
 
4) MRC Dyspnea . Interviewer-administered or self-report assessment of the perception of 
difficulty breathing during five different tasks . Participants  respond either yes or no to each task.  
 
5) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) -BLIND. The MoCA -BLIN D is an  adapted version of 
the original MoCA, a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. The MoCA-
BLIND assesses different cognitive domains: attention, concentration, memory, language, 
conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The MoC A-BLIND has removed assess ments

Participants will complete online questionnaires including: 1) Assessment of pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675170]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675171].  Participants will estimate function using the Clinical Frail Scale, 
an easy to interpret estimate of function than has been validated in several populations. The 
participant will select perceived level of function pr ior to and following admission ranging from 
very active to bedridden/ter minal. Additional questionnaires are described above for Hypotheses 
A and B and will be collected either through the Platform or online via REDCap survey.

The participant logs into the app, and data 
is sent instantaneously to the supervising researcher to inform care plans.  
The app also has  many built-in safety 
features including 0-10 Rate of Perceived 
Exertion (RPE) s cales for exertion and 
dyspnea (Figure 4). The Platform is an 
extensive data collection tool and will allow for detailed tracking of recovery from COVID-19. The Platform  is affordable, accessible, scalable, and sustainable. The Platform has complete d 
five validation and efficacy studies and has two ongoing clinical trials funded by [CONTACT_4289] 
(R44AG055341, R44HL137502) with another pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (R44DC016245)  starting soon. The

and progression of the participant’s Home Exercise Program. The first individual  session will 
consist of a standard physical therapy evaluation, which requires  approximately 60 minutes . 
Goals of the evaluation are to establish the participant’s baseline physical function and identify 
impairments, activity limitations, and participation restri ctions to inform the individual’s 
personalized plan of care. The participant will also be oriented to the over all structure of the 
tele-rehabilitation program and the Platform. Remaining individual sessions will primarily focus 
on biobehavioral inte rventions (30-45 minutes) and assessment and progression of the Home 
Exercise Program (15-20  minutes).   
Biobehavior al Intervention.  
The biobehavioral interventions will be integrated into the tele-rehabilitation program and 
augmented by [CONTACT_675203]. The re will  be 10-12 individual biobehavioral intervention sessions of 
approximately 30-45 minutes/session. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_675179] s 
(Table 2). The biobehavioral inter ventions will focus on increasing physical activity through 
various means. For example, the Fitbit will track daily steps to provide participants feedback 
about daily walking activity ; these  data will be used to set goal s. Additional forms of feedback 
are provided by [CONTACT_675205]; these 
data can also be used to set goals . Goals will be set and tracked using the Platform Goal 
feature. Another focus of the biobehavior al intervention is to provide par ticipants  with the 
knowledge and tools to progress their exercise plans; emphasis will be placed on encouraging 
participants to dose resistance exercises to their 8-repetition maximum (8-RM). Achievement of 8-RM dosing means the participant would be unable to complete a 9
th repetition during one set. 
This principle has been shown to be effective for improving strength and physical function and 
has been implemented by [CONTACT_675206] a medically complex population (Cite - 
Allison’s SNF paper).

progression to standing as able). Prior to starting the 6-week program, enrolled participants will 
receive step -by-step instructions to trial the Platform; a research assistant will help the 
participant troubleshoot technical issues. The treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_675186] s et-up as needed 
during session [ADDRESS_912551] will monitor and assess the pati ent, 
progress the rehabilitation program, and track adherence through the Platform and 
videoconferenc ing. Val idated physical function measures and surv eys will also be collected 
through the Platform at testing timepoints (baseline, week 6, week 12, and week -26), and may 
be collected up to every 2 weeks during both phases of the program.  
Some telerehabi litation sessions w ill be audio and/or video recorded to verify interven tionist 
fidelity .  Participants will  be given the option to allow or to disallow any recordings.   
D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection 
Tools:  
 
Exercise:  
We recognize there may be an increased risk for  falls with greater exposure to physical activity 
and reduced functional capacity due to recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, the increase in balance, confidence, and mobili ty gained through this rehabil itation program  may also decrease fall risk 
over the long term.  
Confidentiality and privacy:  
The use of questionnaires  and collection of personal medical information poses a risk to 
confidentiality and privacy (see Protection Agains t Risk below ). Additionally, subjects may  
experience distress when answering questions related to their recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
 
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks 
 
Protection Against Risk:   
The inclusion/exclusion criteria are designed to assure that the sample is as repr esentative as 
possi ble of the population of patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -[ADDRESS_912552] exp ected variability  beyond that of 
other patients.  
 
Rehabilitation and Exercise:  Intervention will be carefully monitored and progressed on an individual basis by a licensed 
physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  Education on muscle soreness, shortne ss of breath, and fall  risk reduction 
Protocol Template Page 13 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 will occur before any intervention is initiated. Education will also include signs of distress that 
should be communicated to the study team (e.g., dizziness, light headedness, symptoms of 
myocardial infarction). Parti cipants who are identi fied to be at risk for falls will initially perform 
exerc ises seated or while holding onto a sturdy surface. When training is performed in standing 
or walking (e.g., conditions with a potential  risk for falling), safeguards will be taken to ensure a 
sturdy  surface is nearby [CONTACT_675207] a loss of balance occur. For the purpose of safety 
monitoring, we will consider any fall, defined as “inadvertently coming to rest on the ground, 
floor or other lower level, excluding intentional ch ange in position,”  (World Health Organization) 
as unrelated, possibly, probably, or definitely related to study procedures.  Baseline fall risk will be evaluated using the Platform ( ABC scale  questionnaire and the [ADDRESS_912553]) to 
inform e ach individual rehabilitati on plan. Exercise will then be tailored to address any safety 
concerns (e.g., sitting exercises with progression to standing as able, additional balance-focused exercises). Occurrence, circumstances around, and injury associated with any fall will 
be recor ded via the Platform’s health diary feature and a red flag notice will display on the 
dashboard if a fall is recorded. The treating physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_675187] ( AEs) at each session for t he intervention group, and a research assistant will 
ask about falls and other AEs  during each weekly follow-up for the control group. Due to remote 
nature of the AFTER program, we will institute emergency proc edures to respond to any AE that 
occurs during individual sessions. The phy sical location of participants will be verified prior to 
each individual session in the event that emergency response is necessary (call to 911). Any reported falls  occurring outside of i ndividual  sessions will be discussed at the subsequent 
individual s ession or within 24 hours if medical care is required. Fall occurrences (injurious and 
non-injur ious) and other AEs will be reported directly  to the PI. Other exercise side- effects, such 
as muscle pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and minor strains during therapy will be 
documented and monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stevens -Lapsley and [CONTACT_675215] in consultat ion with [CONTACT_675217]. Based on the existing li terature and our own clinical experience with tele-rehabilitation 
(VA RR&D I01RX002417), we anticipate the frequenc y of these side-eff ects to be extremely 
low.

Confidentiality, privacy, protection of data:   
Risks will be minimized b y not including personal identifying information on the forms, when 
possible, and by [CONTACT_675208], functional assessments, and collection of personal 
information in a secure telehealth platform.  All data will be collected using unique patient identification codes. All evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified by a coded number to maintain participant confidential ity. All records will be stored in a locked file cabinet. 
Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap (Rese arch Electronic Data Capture). 
Clinical information will not be released without written per mission of the participant, except as 
necessary  for monitoring by [CONTACT_675209]. Finally, subjects will be monitored for evidence of 
distress associated with study  completion. Any subjects who express a desire for addi tional 
support will be referred to mental health services by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jolley via established clinical referral 
pathways.   
     
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
Potential Recruitment Difficulties : Due to uncertainty  surrounding the COVID -[ADDRESS_912554] 24 hours. In the same time period, there were a total of 27 admitted patients 
(1 new in pas t 24 hours) who tested positive for COVID -19 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675188].  
 
Protocol Template Page 14 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11 
 Missing Data: All participants with outcome measurements  will be included in analysis. The 
importance of reassessment for data collection will be stress ed during enrollment and consent 
and repeated during study participation. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_675210], and all efforts will be made to collect data.  
 
Technical Issues : Technical issues are a concern for telerehabilitation and telehealth programs. 
As such, we have a detailed approach to address any technical issues which may arise.  
1. Participants may call the Res earch PT (or designee) anytime, during regular business 
hours, with issues or concerns.  
2. If a technical issue should arise that the Research PT ca nnot address, they will contact 
[CONTACT_675211]’s Research Associate, Charlotte Kurchian, to discuss.  
3. If needed, Ch arlotte will speak directly with the participant to sol ve the issue. 
4. Although unlikely, Blue  Marble’s programmer may need to participate on the call to 
resolve the issue. The programmer has human subjects training.  
5. The Research PT (or designee) will keep track of any and all technical issues as this is a 
feasibility outcome of the study.  
 
F.   Da ta Analysis Plan:   
 
Sample Size: We estima te the proportion of participants at any session with technical difficulties 
(antic ipate ≤20%), use the platform between sessions (antic ipate ≥50%), and adhere to the 
intervention (anticipate ≥50%). Assum ing these rates, a sample size of 30 and a two-sided 95% 
CI, provides a margin of error of 15% for technical difficulties and 18%, for platform use and adherence. We use preliminary 5-time chair rise data to estimate our effect size (SD=8.7) in our 
outcome and assume adjustment variables, including baseline measures, will explain at least 
50% of the total variance (R2). Using linear regression , we anticipate the width of our 95% 
confidence interval for the group coefficient to be +-0.90*1 SD at week 6 . We anticipate 
additional precision by [CONTACT_675212]. We will also provide descriptive statistics for the change from baseline over time, for each group. 
 
We hypothesize ( B) tele -rehabilitation is associated with improved physical function in 
participants previously admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , as measured by [CONTACT_79667] 30” Chair Stand 
Test at 12 weeks. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< 55, ≥55), sex , and length of 
mechanical ventilation (< 5 days, ≥ 5 days). Hypothesis  A: D escriptive statistics will assess 
feasibility (i.e., adherence, SUS score, and safety). Hypothesis  B will be analyzed with group 
assignment (AFTER program versus control ) as the primary explanatory variable; secondary 
analyses will be made to COMIRB 20 -0703 cohort. Analyses will utilize R (https://www.R -
project.org), SAS (Cary, NC), and GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Code will be portable and reproducible with documenti ng libraries and raw data location, as well as code documenting 
cleaning.   
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
 The proposed study  will 1) address a great and urgent need to identify predictors of multisystem 
recovery and long-term health in survivor s of COVID -19 and 2) evaluate rehabilitative care to 
these individuals even, and especially, when they face post- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675189]-person 
care.

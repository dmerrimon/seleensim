Title of Study : A Randomized , Double -Blind , Controlled Comparison of NRX -101 to 
lurasidone for  Treatment of  Bipolar Depression in Adults  with Suba cute Suicidal 
Ideation or Behavior   
Short Title : Comparison of NRX -[ADDRESS_474719] of Care for Bipolar Depression with 
Subacute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior  
Phase of 
Development:  Phase 2b  
Study Sites:  10-20 sites located in the [LOCATION_002]  
Total Patient  
Number:  74 participants   
Study Duration:  Up to 10 -weeks  per patient : Screening 1  up to 10  days, Treatment from Day 1 to 
Day 42, and F ollow -up on D ay 70 
Background and 
Rationale:  There is no currently -approved  pharmacotherapy for patients with Severe 
Bipolar Depression and Suicidal Ideation or behavior . The purpose of this phase 
2b trial is to determine whether patients with Severe Bipolar Depression and 
subacute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior (i.e . those not requiring inpatient care) 
can be treated effectively with NRX -101. 
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to 
lurasidone (a standard of care medicine)  in improving symptoms of 
depression as measured by [CONTACT_57429] Åsberg Depression Rating 
Scale  (MADRS -10) total score in adults  with severe bipolar depression 
and subacute suicidal ideation or behavior (SSI B). 
Key Secondary Objective s: 
• To test the hypothesis that NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in 
reducing suicidal ideation or behavior as measured by [CONTACT_379274]  (CGI -SS). 
• To test the hypothesis that NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in time to 
treatment failure  as defined as : study discontinuation due to adverse 
events ; psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or requiring a change in 
antidepressant treatment . 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 4 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 Additional Secondary Objectives:  
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -[ADDRESS_474720] of care (lurasidone) in reducing suicidal ideation (MADRS item 
10). 
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to 
lurasidone in reducing the frequency of suicidal thoughts , suicidality and 
risk (SIBAT Module 7) . 
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to 
treatment with lurasidone in the subgroup of participants  recently ( i.e. 
within two weeks  of enrollment) treated with  approved medications for 
bipolar depression (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] /fluoxetine, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], cariprazine, 
lumateprone,  or lurasidone ). 
Safety Objectives:  
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to 
lurasidone  (a standard of care drug ) in reducing suicidality in depressed 
bipolar patient s with SSIB, as measured by [CONTACT_216172] (C -SSRS) . 
• To test the hy pothesis  that participants  treated with NRX -101 are less 
likely to suffer from akathisia than those treated with lurasidone as 
measured by [CONTACT_379275] (BARS) . 
• To test the hypothesis that fewer participants  treated with NRX -101 will 
be discontinu ed for lack of efficacy or exacerbation of suicidality than 
participants  treated with lurasidone . 
Efficacy 
Endpoint(s):  Primary Endpoint:   
• Change from baseline  over 42 days  in MADRS total score . 
Key Secondary Endpoint s:  
• Change from baseline over 42 days in CGI -SS. 
• Time to  treatment failure  in each  arm. 
Additional Secondary Endpoints:   
• Mean c hange from baseline in Suicidal Thoughts on the MADRS 
(MADRS item 10) . 
• Change from baseline to Day 14 in MADRS total score . 
• Change from baseline in each item of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior 
Assessment Tool (SIBAT) Module 7 (clinical global impressions of 
frequency of suicidal thinking, severity of suicidality, and imminent and 
long-term risks) . 
• Change  from baseline to endpoint (Day 42/exit) in MADRS total score 
in the subgroup of participants  who were recently (within 2 -weeks) on 
approved medications for bipolar depression . 
• Percent in remission from suicidality at Day 42/exi t (exploratory 
endpoint) . 
Study Design:  A multicenter, randomized, stratified, double -blind, parallel -group, two -arm 
outpatient study of 74 participants  comparing NRX -101 to lurasidone in a 1:1 
ratio for the treatment o f bipolar depression in participants  with Subacute 
Suicidal Ideation or behavior  and not requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , as reflected by a 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 5 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 rating of  3 or 4 on the C -SSRS  at screening . A priori sample size suggests > 90% 
power based on effect size of >1 seen in phase 2 STABIL -B trial . There is 80% 
power to detect a 0. [ADDRESS_474721] size; a 0.[ADDRESS_474722] size would reach two -sided 
p=0.05.  
Two interim analyses are planned.  The first interim analysis (IA) assessing 
safety will be conducted six weeks after the first [ADDRESS_474723] been 
followed for 6 weeks and the second IA assessing futility (primary efficacy 
endpoint) will be performed after the first [ADDRESS_474724] interim 
analysis if Serious Adverse Events are deemed statistically significantly more 
common in the NRX -101 gr oup compared to the lurasidone group in a manner 
deemed by [CONTACT_379276] a potential danger to human subjects.  The study 
will be stopped at the second IA for futility if the conditional power (CP) is less 
than 10%.  In the event that the study is not st opped for either safety or futility, 
then enrollment will continue until a total of 74 subjects are randomized.  This 
preserves two -sided p=0.05 for the final analysis.

days. 
Analysis Sets:  For efficacy analyses, the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population is defined as all 
participants  who are randomized and receive at least one dose of investigational 
product and ha ve evaluable data from at least one subsequent visit . For safety 
analyses ; the Safety population will include data from all participants  who are 
randomized and receive  at least one  dose of investigational  product . 
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments:  None  
Safety 
Assessments:  The safety of NRX -101 will be assessed via:  
• Adverse Events  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate), weight  
• 12-lead ECGs  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations  
• Physical examination findings  
Other  Assessments:  
• Mean change from baseline to endpoint (Day 42/exit) in C -SSRS score  
• Mean change from baseline to Day 14 in C -SSRS score  
• Mean change in BARS through Day 42 to assess akathisia  
• Rates of discontinuation between arms  
Dosage, Route of 
Administration, 
and Schedule:  On Day 1 , eligible participants  will be  randomized to blinded NRX -101 or 
lurasidone  and placebo  capsules administered twice daily (BID) .  
Investigational product  will be titrated over [ADDRESS_474732] of daily doses of 
700 mg DCS and 33 mg lurasidone and increasing the dose to 950  mg DCS and 
66 mg lurasidone on second day . The total daily NRX -101 maintenance dose for 
Day 3 through Day 42 is 950  mg DCS and 66 mg lurasidone . In the event a 
patient experiences agitation or psychosis, a blinded up -titration is permitted . 
Similarly, a blinded step -down titration is allowed for somnolence . In order to 
maintain the blind, lurasidone/ placebo capsules will be administered to ensure 
participants  take the same number of capsules with each dose administration.  
NRX -101 is supplied in capsules that contain 237.5 mg or 175 mg of DCS and a 
second capsule  that contains 8.25 mg, 16.5 mg, or 33 mg of lurasidone . In order 
to maintain the blind, lurasidone/ placebo capsules will be administered to ensure 
participants  take the same number of  capsules with each dose administration.  
In the case of randomization to lurasidone, the blinded investigational product 
will start with doses of 33 mg lurasidone and increasing the dose to 66 mg . The 
total daily lurasidone maintenance dose for Day 3 through Day 42 is 66 mg.  
Endpoint 
Adjudication  All rating sessions for MADRS -10 and C -SSRS will be recorded as audio files 
and reviewed by [CONTACT_379278] -raters  with >25 years ’ experience . Any MADRS -
[ADDRESS_474733] -visits from any site 
with >10% non -congruen t scores  will be sent to an independent adjudicator 
previously determined to have >90% concordance with study master raters on 
standardized training data . In the event of adjudication as above, the independent 
outside rater score shall be considered as the subject -visit primary study 
endpoint.  
Statistical 
Methods:  All randomized participants  will be evaluated for depression (MADRS) 
suicidality (C -SSRS), and other efficacy endpoints while on the study.  Analyses 
will be conducted under ICH E9 (R1) guidelines.  
Change from baseline in MADRS  total scores  through study exit to compare 
treatments will be analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures analysis  
(SAS PROC MIXED) with Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
containing BPI [CONTACT_324831] (none, any) and evidence of a suicidal event in the ir 
lifetime  (none, any)  as stratification factors . Additional analyses will 
alternatively rely on multiple  imputation  to assess the impact of dropouts . The 
NRX -[ADDRESS_474734] model  for time to 
relapse .  
Sample Size 
Calculation:  Participants  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (NRX -101:lurasidone) . With [ADDRESS_474735] interim analysis (IA) assessing 
safety will be conducted six weeks after the first [ADDRESS_474736] been 
followed for 6 weeks and the second IA assessing futility (primary efficacy 
endpoint) will be perfo rmed after the first [ADDRESS_474737] interim 
analysis if Serious Adverse Events are deemed statistically significantly more 
common in the NRX -101 gr oup compared to the lurasidone group in a manner 
deemed by [CONTACT_379276] a potential danger to human subjects.  The study 
will be stopped at the second IA for futility if the conditional power (CP) is less 
than 10%.  In the event that the study is not st opped for either safety or futility, 
then enrollment will continue until a total of 74 subjects are randomized.  This 
preserves two -sided p=0.[ADDRESS_474738] of the study 
according to 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) parts 50, 54, 56 and 812, 45 CFR 46, to Good 
Clinical Practice ( GCP ), as described in International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
guideline s E6 and E , and to Institutio nal Review Boards.

 6. INTRODUCTION  
6.1 Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in Bipolar Disorder  
Bipolar Disorder (formerly known as manic depressive disorder) is a well -established psychiatric 
diagnosis, with a prevalence of about 2.6% in the [LOCATION_002] (approximately 8.5 million people) 
(Kessler et al., 2005 ). The risk of subacute suicidal ideation or behavior  (SSIB ) is uniquely high 
in patients during bipolar depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], compared to those with major depressive disorder 
(MDD), thought disorders, and personality disorders . Lifetime suicide behavior occurs in 25% to 
56% of people with bipolar disorder  (Nierenberg et al., 2001).  About 40% of the nearly  50,000 
annual deaths from suicide in the [LOCATION_002] are associated with bipolar disorder  (Mahli et al., 
2015 ). The overall rate of death by [CONTACT_379279] [ADDRESS_474746] attempted suicide are 2.3 times more likely to die by [CONTACT_379280] 
a suicide attempt (Coryell et al., 2016 ). Thus, bipolar depression with suicidal ideation has 
uniquely lethal clinical characteristics (Pompi[INVESTIGATOR_45769], et al., 2013 ). 
6.2 Current Treatment Options  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_379245], there is no approved pharmacologic treatment for patients with  
bipolar depression  and suicidal ideation . Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), often combined with 
inpatient psychiatric care, remains the only Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved 
treatment for patients with acute suicidal ideation  in bipolar  depression, despi[INVESTIGATOR_379246]’s well -
documented side effects that include memory loss and confusion, along with its high cost . 
However, the toxicity of ECT is such that it  is less likely to be used in patients with subacute levels 
of suicidal ideation and no oral medication has been shown to reduce suicidal ideation in patients 
with depression  in general or bipolar depression in specific . Physicians are increasingly cautious 
about the use of selective serotonin release inhibitors (SSRIs), particularly in patients with  suicidal 
ideation  because of evidence that SSRIs and other antidepressants may actually increase the risk 
of suicidal ideation, particularly in younger patien ts (Stone et al., 2009).  This evidence has resulted 
in an FDA warning on the label of current antidepressants . Moreover, it seems clear that 
antidepressants do not decrease SSIB  in proportion to their mitigating effect on symptoms of 
depression.   
In recent years, several combined D2/ 5-HT2A antagonists have shown efficacy in treating bipolar 
depression (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/fluoxetine combination, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and lurasidone)  with treatment 
guidelines endorsing common use as first -line standard  of care treatment in acute bipolar 
depression . While these medications are effective at reducing overall symptoms of depression, 
they do not specifically reduce suicidal ideation, as shown in recent clinical trials of lurasidone 
(Loebel et al., 2014a ; Loebel et al., 2014b) . Moreover, in these two studies, individuals with active 
suicidal ideation ( Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale [ MADRS ] item 10 ≥ 4) were 
specifically excluded because of concerns regarding the possibility of exacerbating suicidality with 
 
NRX -101_003  Page [ADDRESS_474747] that increases in anxiety/akathisia may play a critical role (Harada et al., 
2014 ; Popovic et al., 2015 ). Serotonin -related anxiety/akathisia may be modeled in rodents using 
several well -established assay systems, such as the elevated plus maze, and are known to be 
sensitive to serotonergic agents (Sachdev and Brune, 2000 ). In this assay, reduced  percent time 
spent in the open arms of the maze is believed to be associated with increased akathisia and anxiety . 
In contrast, increased total distance traveled in the maze is thought to be a signal related to 
psychosis . As shown by [CONTACT_379281] (2014 ), D-cycloserine ( DCS ) significantly reduces the anxiogenic 
effects of lurasidone and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , as measured by [CONTACT_379282], suggesting that this 
treatment might reduce medication -induced suicidality , as well as suicidality associated with 
bipolar depression  itself.  
Preclinical data, using the Rodent Akathisia model, suggests a potential synergistic interaction 
between DCS and lurasidone . On one hand, as described above, DCS appears to block the 
anxiogenic effects of lurasidone . On the other hand, lurasidone may reverse low -level 
psychotomimetic effects of DCS . Lurasidone mediates its antipsychotic effects at both D2 and 5 -
HT2A receptors . As opposed to pure serotonergic agents used in the treatment of major depressive 
disorders (e.g., SSRIs), the additional D2 blockade  of lurasidone makes it a clinically effective 
antipsychotic; thus, it could also be effective in treating the psychotic symptoms that may be 
induced by [CONTACT_1629] N-methyl -D-aspartate receptor (NMDA R) antagonist.  
Clearly , the phenomena observed in rodents should not be viewed as isomorphic with drug -
induced akathisia and/or restlessness/anxiety syndrome in humans . However, these findings 
provide a rationale for combining glycine site -binding NMDAR antagonists with [ADDRESS_474748] noted in the late 1950s, when it was introduced 
as a treatment for tuberculosis (TB). Several clinicians noted dramatic improvement in patients’ 
depressive symptoms, leading to suggestions of DCS’ potential psychotropic effects . These effects 
were subsequently confirmed in small -scale clinical studies (Crane, 1959  and 1961 ). The 
mechanism of action was unknown at the time, and the finding was not pursued . The interaction 
of DCS with the NMDA R was first demonstrated in 1989 (Hood et al., 1989),  leading to some 
 
NRX -101_003  Page [ADDRESS_474749] in NMDAR blockers as potential antidepressant treatments (Trullas and Skolnick, 1990;  
Skolnick et al., 1996) . For example, both DCS and the related compound 
aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid ( ACPC ) were shown to be active in mice, using the forced 
swim test for depression (Lopes et al., 1997 ). To the best of our knowledge, no clinical 
antidepressant research programs targeting the NMDA receptor were initiated at that time.  
Interest in the potential clinical use of DCS as an antidepressant agent was renewed following 
Berman’s fortuitous observation of ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effect (Berman et al., 2000) . 
An initial study performed with DCS at a dose of 250 mg/d ay did not show therapeutic effect s, but 
it did demonstrate a relative lack of psychotomimetic side effect when DCS was combined with 
concurrent antidepressant treatment (Heresco -Levy et al., 2006 ). Based upon these safety data, a 
study using a higher dose of 1000 mg/d ay was initiated, with results reported in 2013 (Heresco -
Levy et al., 2013) . At the higher dose of 1000 mg /day, significant beneficial effects were observed 
in [ADDRESS_474750] a >0.[ADDRESS_474751] size . In that study, a slow DCS titration was used, with 
250 mg/d ay for 3 days, followed by 500 mg/d ay for 18  days (i.e., until the end of week 3); followed 
by 750 mg/d ay for 1 week (i.e. , until the end of week 4), followed by 1000 mg/d ay (i.e., until the 
end of study) . A statistically significant improvement  was observed in the DCS group compared 
to placebo by [CONTACT_199487] 4, i.e. , within 1 week of initiation of a DCS dose >500 mg/d ay (see 
Figure 1).

The data above provided initial evidence that DCS may be useful as an NMDAR -targeted 
antidepressant, but the time of onset for DCS alone was suboptimal for treating acutely depressed 
individ uals ( Figure 1).

6.5 Investigational Therapy  
In accordance with FDA experience with lurasidone being used to successfully treat depression in 
bipolar disorder, participants  will be randomized on Day 1  in a 1:1 ratio (NRX -101:lurasidone  + 
placebo ) and will receive maintenance treatment with matched twice -daily oral capsules . 
Participants  will continue oral therapy through Day 42 , according to treatment assign ment .  
It is anticipated that participants  will also be receiving concurrent bipolar disorder –directed 
treatment with various predefined combinations of medications . This treatment regimen will be 
maintained upon entry into the study . However, any use of lurasidone, quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], 
risperidone, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  cariprazine,  or lumateperone,  will be discontinued at study 
entry . The treating psychiatrist should ensure that any medications to be discontinued can be done 
so safely . At entry, at the discretion of the investigators  or the delegated treating physician  subjects 
may continue their  mood stabilizers which should not change over the course of the trial . In 
addition, participants  receiving olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/fluoxetine co mbination will continue to receive the 
fluoxetine component.  
6.6  Dose Selection  
Lurasidone is an FDA -approved medication for depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_379247] I 
Disorder (bipolar depression) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate 
at doses of 20 mg to 120 mg daily . The target dose of 66 mg/d ay is based on the mean daily dose 

 
NRX -101_003  Page 22 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 of lurasidone observed during the fixed titration phase of the lurasidone registration trial for its 
indication in bipolar depression (Loebel et al., 2014b ) and further validated in the STABIL -B trial  
(Javitt, et. al. 2018) . Up-titrations are permitted if needed to doses of 99 or 132 mg/d ay, and down -
titrations are permitted to 33 or 49.5 mg/d ay, which span the range of doses used in clinical studies 
of lurasidone (Loebel et al., 2014a ; Loebel et al., 2014b) . 
DCS is well tolerated as a second -line treatment for TB at therapeutic split daily oral doses in the 
range of 500 to 1000 mg/day . Based on prior clinical results and animal studies, it is anticipate d 
that therapeutic effects of DCS will be associated with plasma doses in excess of 25 μg/mL, which 
in turn are generally associated with daily oral doses in excess of 10 mg/kg (i.e. , 700 mg/d ay for a 
70 kg) individual . A starting daily  dose at 700 mg DCS and 33 mg lurasidone will be used, and 
then titrated over 2 days to the target dose of 950  mg DCS and 66 mg lurasidone . Down -titrations 
of DCS to 825 or 700 mg/d ay are available in the case of side effects to permit reduced dosing 
within the anticipated therapeutic range (700 – 950 mg/d ay). The maximum dose of 950 mg/d ay 
is within FDA -approved dosing limits for DCS.  
7. OBJECTIVES  
7.1  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone (a standard 
of care medicine ) in improving symptoms of depression as measured by [CONTACT_57429] 
Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  (MADRS -10) total score in participants  with severe 
bipolar depression and subacute suicidal ideation or behavior (SSIB ). 
7.2 Key Secondary Objectives  
• To test the hypothesis that NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in reducing suicidal 
ideation or behavior as measured by [CONTACT_379283] (CGI -SS) 
• To test the hypothesis that NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in time to treatment failure 
as defined as : study discontinuation due to adverse events; psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
requiring a change in antidepressant treatment  
7.3 Additional Secondary Objectives  
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -[ADDRESS_474752] of care 
(lurasidone) in reducing suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10)  
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in reducing 
the frequency of suicidal thoughts, suicidality and risk (SIBAT Module 7)  
• To test the hypothesis  that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to treatment with 
lurasidone in the subgroup of participants  recently ( i.e. within two weeks  of enrollment) 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 23 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 treated with  approved medications for bipolar depression (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] /fluoxetine, 
quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], cariprazine, lumateprone,  or lurasidone ). 
7.4 Safety Objectives  
• To test the hypothesis that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone (a standard 
of care drug) in reducing suicidality in depressed bipolar participants  with SSIB, as 
measured by [CONTACT_163990] (C -SSRS)  
• To test the hy pothesis  that participants  treated with NRX -101 are less likely to suffer 
from akathisia than those treated with lurasidone as measured by [CONTACT_379284] (BARS)  
• To test the hypothesis that fewer participants  treated with NRX -101 will be discontinued 
for lack of efficacy or exacerbation of suicidality than participants  treated with 
lurasidone.  
7.5 Overview  
This is a group sequential, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, two -arm study 
comparing NRX -101 (n= 37) to lurasidone (n= 37) in a 1:1 ratio for the treatment of bipolar 
depression in participants  with subacute levels of suicidal ideation, as reflected by [CONTACT_379285] “yes” to item 3 and 4 on the C -SSRS within 4 -weeks  of screening , and do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
Participants  will be screened to ensure study eligibility  prior to randomization on Day 1 . 
Randomized participants  will take either oral NRX -101 or lurasidone  and placebo , in accordance 
with their treatment assignment, for 42 days . Participants  will return to the investigational site on 
Day 70 for a follow -up visit (see Study Schema, Figure 3). During these visits, multiple 
psychometric scales will be completed,  and participants  will be assessed for safety, including the 
risk of increase in depression or suicidal ideation to the point where inpatient care or an alternative 
treatment is indicated .

the patient  is admitted to the study . A full medical and psychiatric history will be taken,  and a 
physical and laboratory examination will be performed, as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). The Screening period may extend to  10 days following the signing of the informed 
consent form in order to allow sufficient time for Screening procedures to be completed and results 
reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rating Scale  
The site will upload digital audio files  and score summaries  of the MINI and MADRS , and the 
score summary for the C -SSRS . The MINI diagnostic interview , MADRS , and C -SSRS  scores 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_379287].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  eGFR Calculation  
Using the results of the chemistry panel, glomerular filtration rate will be estimated by [CONTACT_379288] -Gault formula , as follows : 
•  CrCl (male) = ([140 -age] × weight in kg)/(serum creatinine × 72)  
•  CrCl (female) = CrCl (male) × 0.85  
Because participants  with renal insufficiency may accumulate cycloserine, participants  with 
moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) or worse will be excluded from study 
participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screen Failures  
In the event a patient is a screen failure, the patient may be rescreened at the discretion  of the 
investigator and Medical Monitor.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_474768] dose of blinded treatment on Day 1. This visit will be followed by [CONTACT_379289] 7, 14, 28, and 42 . Following completion of the Treatment Period , participants  will be

 contact[CONTACT_379290] -up on Day 70. In order to allow scheduling flexibility , and 
(considering pandemic related limitations ), visit windows will be allowed as noted in Table 1. 
Participants  will be withdrawn from the study if their urine tox icology  screenings  at two 
consecutive study treatment visit s are positive for cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] , non-prescribed amphetamine s, 
or non-prescribed barbiturates . 
9.1.[ADDRESS_474769], the patient  will be asked about the 
reason(s) for discontinuation and the presence of any A Es. If possible, the patient  will be asked to 
complete the Day 42/Early Termination (ET) visit prior to discontinuation, and day [ADDRESS_474770] of care or, should the patient  choose, return to treatment by a 
prior/referring physician . In thi s case, the investigator will facilitate and coordinate follow -up to 
ensure continuity of care .  
Participants  who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.  
10. TREATMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
10.[ADDRESS_474771] will be affected  while maintaining a blinded study design (see 
Table 2 for NRX -101 and Table 3 for lurasidone ). Up-titration will increase the lurasidone dose, 
and will not alter the DCS dose . Down -titration decreases the total daily dose of both lurasidone 
and DCS in the NRX -101 group and only the lurasidone dose in the lurasidone group.

Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for further information.  
11.2 Study Drug Monitoring  
An Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) System will be used in this study . The ePRO 
will send daily reminders at designated hours to participants  enrolled in the study to take their 
study drug via text messages to each patient ’s own cell phone . The patient must respond 
affirmatively to enable compliance tracking.  
The ePRO system will also host an audit trail for recording patient responses and an email alert 
message system to the site staff if no response or negative response is received from the patient . 
The ePRO system will be available to authorized site users through the Prevail Single 
Interface  TM (SI). 
Patient  will grant the study site permission to contact [CONTACT_12552]/her on the mobile device if a personal 
telephone number(s) cannot be reached . Additionally, sites will review drug utilization through 
receipt of used drug kits and assessments with participants . 
12. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Study procedures are described below . Assessment time points are included in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). 
12.1 Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS ) 
The Montgomery Åsberg  Depression Rating Scale is a 10 -item clinician -rated scale, with each 
item rated on a 0 –6 severity scale ( Montgomery, Åsberg 1979 ). The timeframe for the baseline 
MADRS -[ADDRESS_474778] seven days; for the MADRS -[ADDRESS_474779] assessment .  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 36 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 12.2 Clinical Global Impression -Severity for Suicide  
The three  Clinical Global Impression scales represent the final  three  global ratings from the 
Suicidality Ideation  Inventory  and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT Module 7) , which is 
designed for the clinician to assess the relative risk and overall risk of suicide across different time 
scales  (Alphs et al ., 2016 ). The questions assess the clinician’s global impression of immediate 
risk of suicide (that day), imminent risk of suicide (over the next 7 days), and long -term risk (i.e. , 
likely to end their life by [CONTACT_379291]) . Each risk (immediate, imminent, long -
term) is rated along a graded impressions scale starting at 0 (‘normal’, ‘not suicidal’ or ‘no risk’) 
and ranges to 6 (‘among the most extremely suicidal’ or ‘extreme risk for imminent’/’long -term 
suicide’).  
12.3 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS  psychosis subscale ) 
Overall  the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) is an 18 -item clinician -rated scale that assess es 
a range of psychotic and affective symptoms, rated from both observation of the patient and the 
patient’s own report (Overall and Gorham, 1962) . Only the 4 -item positive symptom subscale 
referred  to in this document as  the “BPRS  psychosis subscale ” (i.e., suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703], hallucinations, 
unusual thought content, and conceptual disorganization) will be used.  
12.4 Concise Health Risk Tracking – Self Report (CHRT -SR) and Clinician Rating 
(CHRT -C) 
The Concise Health Risk Tracking – Self Report (CHRT -SR) and – Clinician (CHRT -C) are 
assessment s of suicidality and related thoughts and behaviors  (Trivedi et al., 2011) . The CHRT -
SR is a 16-item self -report suicidal ideation scale, and the CHRT -C is a 9 -item clinician -rated 
behavioral module . Items are rated on a fully anchored five -point Likert scale with responses 
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) . The time frame is the past seven days.  
13. OTHER DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS  
13.1 Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 7.0.2  
The MINI  (Sheehan et al., 1998 ) is a short, structured diagnostic interview developed initially in 
1990 by [CONTACT_379292] -III-R and ICD -10 
psychiatric disorders . The tool has been updated to map to DSM -5 diagnostic criteria in the MINI 
7.0.2.  
13.2 Bipolarity Index (BPI)  
For this study, the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_379253] . The BPI (Aiken et al., 
2015 ) is a clinician -rated scale that rates cardinal features of bipolar disorder across five domains : 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_379254] (signs and symptoms); age of onset (first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]); course of illness; 
response to treatment; and family history . Possible scores range from 0 –100 and a score of 50 has 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 37 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 a high sensitivity and specificity for the identification of bipolar disorder . The index scores will 
not be used for study entry, but will help inform diagnostic impression.  
14. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
14.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is: 
• Mean change from baseline in total MADRS score  
14.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint are: 
• Change from baseline over 42 days in CGI -SS 
• Time to treatment failure in each arm  
14.3 Additional  secondary efficacy endpoint s: 
• Mean c hange from baseline in Suicidal Thoughts on the MADRS (MADRS item 10)  
• Change from baseline to Day 14 in MADRS total score  
• Change from baseline in each item of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool 
(SIBAT) Module 7 (clinical global impressions of frequency of suicidal thinking, severity 
of suicidality, and imminent and long -term risks)  
• Change  from baseline to endpoint (Day 42/exit) in MADRS total score in the subgroup of 
participants  who were recently (within 2 -weeks) on approved medications for bipolar 
depression  
• Percent in  remission at Day 42/exi t. 
15. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Study procedures are described below . Assessment time points are included in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). 
15.1 Safety Scales  
15.1.1  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a low -burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was 
developed in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters 
Study to assess severity and track suicidal events through any tre atment (Posner et al., 2007) . The 
timeframe for assessment is for both lifetime and the past [ADDRESS_474780] visit for all other ratings.  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 38 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
  
15.1.2  Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE)  
The Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects ( PRISE ) is a self -rated questionnaire (Rush and 
Asberg, 1999 ; Wisniewski et al., 2006 ) will be used to assess the specific symptoms considered 
by [CONTACT_379293] . The timeframe for assessment is at 
Screening for the Screening scale and in the past week f or all other ratings.  
15.1.3  Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS)  
The Barnes Akathisia (BARS)  (Barnes,  1989 ) is a clinician -rated scale to assess drug -induced 
akathisia as absent, mild, moderate, or severe . It comprises items for rating the observable, restless 
movements which characterize the condition, the subjective awareness of restlessness, and any 
distress associated with the akathisia . In addition, there is an item for rating global severity . The 
timeframe for the scale is “at this time.”  
15.[ADDRESS_474781] medical occurrence in a clinical study patient  administered a medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) product . An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship to the treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) pr oduct.  
This definition includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency 
from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test 
abnormalities.  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date and time when the AE started and stopped  
• Maximum intensity or changes in intensity  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  (see Section 15.2.3 ) 
• Expectedness  
• Investigator assessment of relationship to investigational product  
• Action taken with regard to the investigational product  (uptitration, downtitration, 
temporarily discontinued, permanently discontinued or no action taken)  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 39 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 • AE caused patient ’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no)  
• Outcome  
Adverse events will be collected from the time of signature [CONTACT_379329] -up visit or early termination . Whenever possible, diagnoses will be given 
when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore 
throat, and head congestion will be reported as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”).  
Worsening symptoms of the primary study condition (i.e., bipolar depression) will be recorded as 
a primary endpoint rating .  
Any A E(s) that are unresolved at the follow -up visit (Day 70)  will continue to be followed by [CONTACT_379294], but without further recording in the eCRF . The 
Contract Research Organization ( CRO ) and its representative retain the right to request additional 
information for any patient  with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if deemed  
medically  necessary.  
15.2.2  Adverse Event Intensity  and Relationship  
Intensities for each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_1694]: 
• Mild : Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated ; 
• Moderate : Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities ; or 
• Severe : Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities.  
Relationship to investigational product will be assessed by [CONTACT_379295]:  
• Not Related : Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes and  does not meet 
criteria listed under possible or probable.  
• Unlikely Related : Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration . 
May have been produced by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_379296][INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Possibly Related : Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration but  may 
have been also produced by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
• Related : Clear -cut temporal association with administration with improvement on 
cessation of investigational product or reduction in dose . Reappears upon re -challenge . 
Follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product.  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 40 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 15.2.3  Recording of Adverse Events  
AE(s) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_379297] -ended  question from study 
personnel , such as, “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?” or  that are  
revealed by [CONTACT_379298] . When reporting  AE(s), the recording of 
diagnos is is preferred (when possible) , rather than reporting the  list of signs and symptoms . 
However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part 
of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
Participants  should  be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_1720] a member of the clinical site staff 
at any time between visits concerning A E(s)or worsening of symptoms.  
15.2.4  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
The following criteria define a n SAE : 
• Death  
• Life-threatening event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] >24 hours or prolongation >24 hours of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Persistent or significant disability/in capacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important event, as defined in this protocol*  
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379255] . These will usually 
be considered serious.  
In addition, the following variables will be collected , where applicable,  for SAEs:  
• Date AE met criteria for SAE  
• Date investigator became aware of SAE  
• Description of SAE 
• Explanation of seriousness of t he AE 
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 41 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 • Causality assessment in relation to investigational product  
• Causality assessment in relation to other medication  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe A E(s). Severity is a measure of intensity , 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_91980] . An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be 
considered serious . If inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379256], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128023] . 
SAEs will be reported from the time of informed consent through the Follow -up visit or early 
termination . Unsolicited SAEs will be collected up to [ADDRESS_474782] study treatment.  
15.2.5  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
When a n SAE is discovered, it will be reported immediately (within 24 business hours  of the site’s 
knowledge of the event) to the Sponsor/CRO Medical Monitor . Reportable events which do not 
meet the criteria for an SAE will include (but will not be limited to) : (a) pregnancy, and (b) 
clinically significant (in the judgment of the investigator) severe psychiatric complications .  
The eCRF  will provide a mechanism for sites to report SAEs, and for investigators and the Medical 
Monitor  to sign off on the SAE reports.  
Reportable SAEs will be sent to the FDA by [CONTACT_379299] . Sites are 
responsible for submission of SAE reports to their IRB(s), in accordance with IRB policies .  
15.2.6  Anticipated Serious Adverse Events  
Tan et al (2021 ) publication Identifying Anticipated Events of  Future Clinical Trials 
by [CONTACT_379300] [ADDRESS_474783] common Serious Adverse Events.  
Based on this publication, the anticipated Serious Adverse Events are:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], psychiatric symptoms  
• Suicidal behavior, overdose  
• Cholecystitis  
• Fall 
• Road traffic accident, injury  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overdose  
Overdose of the investigational product will be considered  an SAE, even when there are no 
symptoms or additional A Es, and will be reported according to the guidelines in Section 15.2.[ADDRESS_474784] be reported as an AE.  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 42 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Suicidal Ideation and Clinical Management  
The documentation and proper management of suicidal ideation by [CONTACT_379301] C -SSRS, completed by [CONTACT_379302] . Safety will be evaluated 
throughout the course of the study . 
Any patient  who, based on the investigator’s judgment, poses an imminent risk of suicide should 
be discontinued from the study . Suicide risk is assessed by [CONTACT_379303] .  
Suicide, self -harm , and attempted suicide, irrespective of the method, will be reported as A Es (all 
suicides are SAEs; attempted suicides are considered to be  SAEs) . The event will be identified as 
suicide or attempted suicide, and the method of the suicide or attempt will be provided . If an 
attempted suicide meets the criteria for an SAE, the event must be reported according to the 
guidelines in Sections 15.2.4 . If a suicide attempt does not meet the criteria for an SAE, it will be 
considered a reportable AE , and a Suicidal Ideation or behavior  Reportable Event Form will be 
completed by [CONTACT_379304] 15.2.5 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
If a patient  (or patient’ s partner) becomes pregnant during the study, it must be reported within 24 
business hours of the time the investigator becomes aware of the event and in accordance with the 
procedures described on the Pregnancy Report Form . Although pregnancy itself is not regarded as 
an SAE/AE, unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness 
of a contraceptive medication, the pregnancy details will be  captured in the AE/SAE module of

for the duration of her participation in the study .  
15.3 Concomitant Medications, Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and Alcohol Restrictions  
15.3.1  Concomitant Medications  
Lurasidone is contraindicated  with the use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) and 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin)  (see Appendix 1). The lurasidone dose should not exceed 
40 mg/day if co -administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors . There are no known reported 
interactions between DCS and lurasidone.  
It is anticipated that participants  entering the study will be receiving concurrent disorder -directed 
treatment with various combinations of medications, including:  
• Approved antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TeCAs, fluoxetine), but not 5 -HT-2A 
antagonists (lurasidone, aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] /fluoxetine , quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , cariprazine,  or 
lumateperone ) 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 43 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 • Mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproic acid , and lamotrigine ) 
Participants  will be permitted into the study if they are treated with no more than one drug from 
each category of the indicated classes . Approved antidepressants and mood stabilizers will be 
maintained at stable  dosages throughout the study . This is both to ensure continued treatment and 
to prevent withdrawal symptoms that may occur if such drugs are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_379257] . 
Participants  taking aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] , risperidone, brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], lumateperone,  olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  
cariprazine,  or quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_379258] .  
Allowed concomitant medications include any prescription or over -the-counter medication not 
specifically excluded by [CONTACT_760] (see  Appendix 1), as well as stable, ongoing antidepressant 
or mood stabilizer therapy and stable allowed hypnotic therapy . Participants  requiring excluded 
medications  will be discontinued from the study  and an Early Termination Visit will be performed 
in accordance with Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_474786] sign the informed consent 
form prior to beginning the washout period . Clinically appropriate tapering regimens should  be 
used, if applicable . The Screen ing period may be extended, upon consultation with the Medical 
Monit or, to allow for a sufficient washout period.  
All concomitant medications taken during the study  and 4 -weeks prior to study entry  will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) for each patient,  along with dosage information 
and start and stop dates.  
15.3.2  Concomitant Therapy  
Participants  receiving concurrent psychotherapy  that has been stable in type and frequency (e.g., 
weekly, monthly) for at least 3 months prior to Screening are eligible for study entry if the 
psychotherapy is expected to remain stable for the duration of the patient’s  participation in the 
study . Any changes in psychotherapy type and/or frequency during the study should be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor as soon as the investigator is aware of the proposed change.  
15.3.[ADDRESS_474787] a positive urine drug screen two times in a row for use of any cocaine,

NRX -101_003  Page 44 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 15.4 Laboratory/Diagnostic Procedures  
Clinical laboratory safety testing will be performed  locally at the study site using a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA )-certified laboratory . The frequency and type of 
procedure s are detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). Local lab oratory  normal ranges 
must  be reported according to gender.  
Participants  will have their blood drawn for clinical chemistry (ALT, AST, GGT, ALK 
phosphatase, Creatinine, T4, T3,TSH, Albumin, BUN, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, 
Glucose, Total Bilirubin, Direct Billirubin, Total Protein, Total Cholesterol, HDL/LDL, 
Triglycerides, Uric Acid, HbA1c ) and hematology testing  (Red blood cell count, White blood cell 
count, Platelet count, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Neutrophils Absolute or percent , Lymphocytes 
Absolute or  percent , Monocytes Absolute or percent , Eosinophils Absolute or percent , Basophils 
Absolute or percent ). Urine sample testing  for pregnancy and drug screen  will be by [CONTACT_5230] . In 
the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result(s), follow -up laboratory testing 
may be conducted, at the discretion of the investigator . If applicable, clinically signi ficant changes 
from baseline in laboratory results will be noted as A E(s), in accordance with Section 15.2.1 . 
15.5 Physical Examinations, Vital Signs , Height, and Weight  
Physical examinations, vital signs, height, and weight will be obtained at the noted visits . Vital 
signs (blood pressure and heart rate) may be repeated 15 min apart, as needed, in order to obtain a 
resting reading . If applicable, clinically significant changes from baseline in physical examination 
parameters, vital signs, and weight will be noted as A E(s), in accordance with Section 15.2.[ADDRESS_474788] 5 minutes . All digital ECGs will include the  date and time obtained , heart rate, QRS 
duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, and QTcF interval  using Fridericia formula  
(Puddu  et al., 1988) . If indicated, additional ECG assessments may be performed,  at the discretion 
of the investigator . If applicable, clinically significant changes from baseline in ECG assessments 
will be noted as A E(s), in accordance with Section 15.2.[ADDRESS_474789] (DSMB)  
The study will be monitored for safety , futility,  and efficacy by a DSMB . Interim analysis for 
safety will be conducted six weeks after the first [ADDRESS_474790] reached day 42 .  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 45 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 16. STATISTICS  
The study analyses will be conducted in a GCP environment (ICH E6  and E9 [R1] ). All analyses 
will be pre -specified in a Statis tical Analysis (SAP) and finalized prior to database  lock. If the 
methods in the SAP do not agree with this protocol, the methods described in the SAP will govern 
the analysis .  
16.1 Randomization  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_110042] a suicidal event in the prior 12 months (none, any ).  
16.2 Study Populations  
The study includes prospectively defined study populations . The Intent to Treat ( ITT) population 
will include all participants  who received at least one dose of the oral treatment and  had any post –
randomization efficacy assessments . The modified ITT (mITT) population will include  the ITT 
population with at least one post -baseline efficacy observation ; the mITT population will also 
exclude subjects with a major protocol deviation, e.g. ineligibility, unreliabl e MADRS -10 scoring , 
proscribed treatment .  The Per Protocol ( PP) population will include the subset of ITT participants  
who were eligible, who have any post –randomization efficacy assessments within one day of 
scheduled visits through Day [ADDRESS_474791] –randomization safety data.  
The mITT population will be used for the primary analyses  for efficacy . If <5  percent  are to be 
excluded from the ITT population, then the analysis will not be performed for the PP population.  
Protocol violations will be reviewed in real time and prospective rules will be set for exclusions 
from the PP population . A Biostatistics Data Review Meeting (BDRM) will be held to identify all 
major protocol deviations prior to database lock inclusive of any  case exclusions  from the mITT 
and PP population  as well as t o censor any efficacy data following proscribed treatments . 
16.3 Hypothesis Tests  
16.3.1  Treatment Comparisons  
In order to preserve the Type 1 error associated with multiple endpoints (per FDA guidance), all 
efficacy endpoints will be evaluated in this pre-defined order : (1) MADRS  through Week 6 . Each 
will be hypothesis testing driven.  
16.3.2  Primary Hypothes is 
MADRS  
The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in 
improving symptoms of depression as measured by [CONTACT_379305] 6 weeks of treatment . The 
primary study hypothesis is that treatment with NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in improving 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 46 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 symptoms of depression as measured by [CONTACT_379306] 6 weeks of treatment. The null 
hypothesis for the primary endpoint is the mean change from baseline of MADRS -10 for NRX -
101 is the same as lurasidone . Baseline is defined as MADRS -10 score at study entry .  
The null hypothesis is no difference in the mean change in the MADRS -10 score from baseline to 
Day 42 /exit between both treatment groups, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is a larger 
mean improvement in the NRX -[ADDRESS_474792]  80% 
power to detect a  0.[ADDRESS_474793] with 5% Type 1 error using 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM).   
16.3.3  Key Secondary  Hypotheses  
The key secondary  hypothesis are that: 
• treatment with NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in improving symptoms of suicidality as 
measured by [CONTACT_87791] -SS over 6 weeks of treatment . The null hypothesis for the primary 
endpoint is the mean change from baseline of CGI-SS for NRX -101 is greater than or equal 
to the mean change from baseline of CGI -SS for  lurasidone while the alternative hypothesis 
is that the mean change from baseline of CGI-SS is less than the mean change from baseline 
of CGI -SS for  lurasidone  (improvement) . Baseline is defined as CGI-SS score at this study 
entry . 
• that NRX -101 is superior to lurasidone in time to  treatment failure as defined as : study 
discontinuation due to Adverse Events; psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or requiring a change 
in antidepressant treatment . Time to treatment failure may be ascertained as the treating 
physician’s determination of a study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy; withdrawal 
due to a treatment related adverse event a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the patient 
requiring any change in their baseline antidepressant, mood stabili zer, or antipsychotic 
medication . Titration or change in timing of administration of study medication will not be 
considered a failure of therapy . Lack of efficacy is  defined as the need to implement a new 
treatment plan or an increase in suicidal ideation (a score of 4  or 5 on the C -SSRS, emergent 
suicidality requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), or increase in depressive symptoms (a score increase 
of ≥5 for two consecutive visits on the MADRS total score) . The need to implement a new 
treatment plan includes the add ition of new antidepressant medication or somatic treatment 
(e.g. ECT or rTMS treatment) or an escalation of care such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e. moving 
the patient from outpatient care to initiating inpatient, partial or day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) . Time 
to failure  will be assessed using a Kaplan -Meier lifetable . The formal hypothesis test will 
be to detect  a 0.[ADDRESS_474794] ratio (HR) with 80% power for a two -sided test using a 
proportional hazard model ; a 0. [ADDRESS_474795] ratio reaches two-sided p=0.[ADDRESS_474796] randomization by [CONTACT_51867] -model repeated 
measures analysis.  
16.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint s are: 
• Change from baseline in CGI -SS score as measured by [CONTACT_379307] 
[ADDRESS_474797] randomization by [CONTACT_51867] -model repeated measures analysis.  
• Time to Treatment Failure (TTF ) A Kaplan -Meier lifetable will be constructed for the time 
to failure of therapy . Failure of therapy will be defined as the treating physician’s 
determination of a study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy;  withdrawal due to a 
treatment related adverse event  a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the patient requiring any 
change  in their  baseline  antidepressant , mood stabilizer, or antipsychotic medication . 
Titration  or change in timing of administration  of study medication wil l not be considered 
a failure of therapy.  
The additional efficacy endpoints are:  
• Change from baseline to endpoint in Suicidal Thoughts on the MADRS (MADRS item 10 )  
• Mean change from baseline to Day 14 in total MADRS score  
• Change from baseline to endpoint in each item of the Suicide Ideation and Behavior 
Assessment Tool (SIBAT) Module 7 (clinical global impressions of frequency of suicidal 
thinking, severity of suicidality, and imminent and long -term risks)  
16.4.3  Other Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The following other  efficacy endpoints will be explored : 
• Remission  from suicidality : A Kaplan -Meier lifetable will be constructed for the 
remission  duration from response onset where remission is defined as reaching CSSR -S ≤ 2 
and remaining through the study . Remission rate is defined as percent remaining in  
remission.  
Collectively, symptom improvement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_379308]:  
• Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS ) (Montgomery, Åsberg 1979 ) 
• Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Suicidality Scale (CGI -SS) 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 48 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 • Concise Health Risk Tracking – Self Report (CHRT -SR) and Clinician Rating (CHRT -C) 
scales (Trivedi et al., 2011)  
• Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (Overall and Gorham, 1962) . 
16.4.[ADDRESS_474798]  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed by  [CONTACT_1570] : 
• Dose per treatment group  
• Suicide rates (attempted and completed)  
• Time to all -cause study discontinuation (and reason for discontinuation)  due to any reason 
such as withdrawal due to an adverse event, or patient or investigator decision to withdraw  
• Rate of participants  who achieve a resolution of suicide risk by [CONTACT_379309] [CGI -SR] 0 or 1) or by [CONTACT_45689]  (suicidal ideation item  #10 of 0 or 1)  
• Proportion of participants  who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proportion of participants  who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages  
• Efficacy for each MADRS  factor ; mania, depression, irritability, anxiety, and psychosis  
16.4.5  Diagnostic Metric  
The following metrics will be evaluated at baseline:  
• MINI 7.0.2  
16.5 Safety Assessments  
• Change from baseline to endpoint (Day 42) in C -SSRS  score  
• Change from baseline to endpoint (Day 14) in C -SSRS score  
• Mean change in BARS through Day 42 to assess akathisia  
• Percent in remission at Day 42/exit , defined as having achieved a MADRS score of ≤ [ADDRESS_474799] two visits (14 days)  
• Rates of discontinuation between the arms  
16.5.1  Overall Adverse Events  
Separate and combined safety analyses will be performed for the Safety population . All safety 
results will be presented separately for each treatment group . Safety endpoints will include adverse 
events (AEs), vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory parameters.  
The principle of treatment emergence will be employed for the analysis of AE data . Treatment 
emergence is defined as any event that occurred following the initiation of therapy  and was not 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 49 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 present at baseline, or one which represents an exacerbation of a condition present prior to study 
entry (pre -existing).  
Unresolved AE outcomes at the end of the study will be followed for an additional seven days or 
until resolution, whichever occurs earlier.  
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA) . 
For each study treatment, safety data will be collected and analyzed until treatment -emergent AEs 
are resolved . The type, incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of treatment -
emergent AEs will be reported . Reasons for withdrawal due to AEs will also be reported.  
Two-sided Fisher Exact tests will be performed to compare the two  treatment groups  with respect 
to incidence at the system order class level and for any preferred terms with >10  percent  overall 
incidence . 
16.5.2  Other Safety Measures  
The timing and incidence of adverse findings will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_379260] a designated safety monitor.  
Vital signs and ECGs will also be evaluated within and between study treatment groups . The 
overall ECG interpretation will be reported as normal or abnormal; if abnormal, then the percent 
clinically significant will be reported.  
While symptom improvement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_379310] (CHRT, MADRS , and CGI -SS), safety measures in the C-SSRS,  PRISE, BPRS, and 
BARS (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and between study treatment 
groups . The timeframe is for both lifetime and the past six months for the baseline Screening scale 
and since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale.  
16.[ADDRESS_474800] size for BDI -II (Heresco -Levy, 2013 ) and an effect size of 
>[ADDRESS_474801] size is targeted  in the sample size calculations assuming a 1:[ADDRESS_474802] size which corresponds to a mean 8 .85-unit MADRS -10 advantage change from baseline 
for NRX -101 vs control.  A total of 74 subjects are to be randomized 1:1 to support the final 
analysis.  As summarized below in Table 6, there is 80% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_474803] size; a 
 
NRX -101_003  Page [ADDRESS_474804] size would reach two -sided p=0.05.  A 0.4 62 (moderate) effect size reflects a 50 
percent drop (based on lurasidone published data) in mean change from baseline for lurasidone 
with an assumed standard deviation of 13 .4; this approximately corresponds to a -16 mean CFB 
for NRX -101 and a -10 mean CFB for lurasidone.

The secondary efficacy hypotheses will also be evaluated using a hierarchical testing strategy 
where testing continues as long as two -sided p <0.[ADDRESS_474806] interim analysis (IA) assessing safety will be 
conducted six weeks after the first [ADDRESS_474807] been followed for 6 weeks and the 
second IA assessing futility (primary efficacy endpoint) will be performed after the first [ADDRESS_474808] interim analysis if Serious Adverse Events are deemed 
statistically significantly more common in the NRX -101 group compared to the lurasidone group 
in a manner deemed by [CONTACT_379276] a  potential danger to human subjects.  The study will be 
stopped at the second IA for futility if the conditional power (CP) is less than 10%.  In the event 
that the study is not st opped for either safety or futility, then enrollment will continue until a total 
of 74 subjects are randomized.  This preserves  two-sided p=0.[ADDRESS_474809] (DSMB). The blinded Sponsor biostatistician will then adjudicate  cases with 
respect to intercurrent events which impact analysis inclusion.    
16.7 Adjudication of Primary Endpoint  
All rating sessions for MADRS -10 and C -SSRS will be recorded as audio files and reviewed by 
[CONTACT_379278] -raters  with > [ADDRESS_474810] -visits from any site with >10% non -congruent scores will be sent to an 
independent adjudicator, previously determined to have >90% concordance with study master 
 
NRX -101_003  Page [ADDRESS_474811] at each time; these p -values will be presented as 
descriptive statistics.  
For continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum will be 
presented, together with the total number of observations and the number of missing and non -
missing values.  
For ordinal and categorical variables, absolute and relative frequencies will be reported. Relative 
frequencies will be based on all observations and reported as percentages. Unless otherwise 
specified, percentages will be based on the number of participants  with data and will not be 
calculated for missing categories.  
Adverse events, medical histories, and concomitant medications will be reported on a patient and 
an event basis. P ercentages  will be calculated using the number of participants  in the Safety 
population analysis set as the denominator.  
All hypotheses will be tested at 5 percent  (final analysis) level of significance using a two -sided 
test unless otherwise specified . 
16.8.4  Estimand Structure  
Analyses will be conducted in accordance with ICH E9 (R1) analysis principles as summarized 
below.  
Primary scientific question of 
interest  The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with NRX -
101 is superior to lurasidone in improving symptoms of 
depression as measured by [CONTACT_379306] 6 weeks of 
treatment. The null hypothesis for the primary endpoint is 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 52 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 the mean change from baseline of MADRS -10 for NRX -
101 is the same as lurasidone  while the alternative 
hypothesis is that the mean change from baseline of 
MADRS -10 is larger than the mean change from baseline 
of MADRS -10 for lurasidone. Baseline is defined as 
MADRS -10 score at study entry.  
 
Target population  The mITT  population will be the primary analysis 
population. The mITT population is d efined through 
appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria as specified in the 
protocol  and blinded BDRM decisions . 
 
Treatment of interest  NRX -101 
Outcome Variable  MADRS -10 (and C -SSRS ) will be recorded as audio files 
and reviewed by [CONTACT_379278] -raters  with any non-
congruent  subject -visits from any site with >10% non -
congruent scores sent to a  qualified  independent adjudicator  
to be considered as the subject -visit primary study endpoint.  
 
Summary Measure  The contrast -estimated MADRS -[ADDRESS_474812] -baseline data  with LOCF in the mITT 
population  excluding all outcomes after BDRM -approved 
exclusions .  The model will include treatment and the 
following four baseline stratification factors  in addition to 
baseline MADRS -10: (1) sex, (2) mood stabilizer use, (3) 
anti-psychotic use, and (4) evidence of suicide event in the ir 
lifetime . The model will include treatment group, study 
visit, the interaction between study visit and treatment 
group, baseline MADRS -10, and the four baseline 
covariates  as fixed effects. An unstructured error structure 
will be as sumed.   
 
Intercurrent Events  A BDRM will adjudicate all intercurrent events which may 
redact outcomes after disqualifying events; these 
intercurrent events may represent major protocol 
deviations .  Any ITT subject with no post -baseline 
MADRS -[ADDRESS_474813] Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be the primary analysis for the primary 
efficacy endpoint  (MADRS change from baseline); an unpaired t -test will be a secondary analysis . 
The proportional hazard model (PHREG) will be the primary analysis for time to event endpoints 
(time to relapse, time to discontinuation); the unstratified log rank test will be a secondary analysis. 
The MMRM and PHREG models will all include treatment and the following four baseline 
stratification factors:  
• sex 
• mood stabilizer use  
• anti-psychotic use  
• evidence of suicide event in the ir lifetime . 
All primary analyses will be in the ITT population as primary and repeated in the Per Protocol 
population if > 5 percent are excluded.  
All of the instruments used to measure SSIB  or depression constitute serial continuous and ordinal 
outcomes that will be analyzed using MMRM with LOCF to account for missing data and early 
discontinuations . The models will include treatment group, study visit, the interaction between 
study visit and treatment group, the baseline level of the variable being analyzed, and the  above 
four pre -defined  baseline stratifica tion factors as fixed effects . The primary endpoint change from 
baseline MADRS -10 will be analyz ed using the MMRM model which will include baseline 
MADRS; treatment group; study visit; study visit*treatment; sex, mood stabilizer use, anti -
psychotic use, and evidence of suicide event  in the ir lifetim e as defined above . An unstructured 
error structure will be assumed.  
SAS PROC MIXED will be used for continuous endpoints and PROC GENMOD will be used for 
binary endpoints . 
In addition, multiple imputation will be performed to address any missing data . The method of 
Little and Rubin will be used . The presentation of the results for the primary eff icacy  endpoints 
using the ITT population will be based on the observed data with multiple imputation for missing 
endpoint data using SAS PROC MI . Missing data will be imputed using MCMC imputation under 
the assumption of a missing at random using the ITT population. The SAS® procedure PROC MI 
will be used for the MCMC imputation of 2 5 complete data sets.  
16.8.6  Other Time to Event  Efficacy Endpoint s 
Other t ime-to-event outcomes ( all-cause discontinuation, and remission  duration ) further 
characterize this multi -component  disorder. Time to event is a more sensitive measure than an 
assessment at a fixed time. Time to such events will be displayed using a Kaplan -Meier lifetable, 
with the treatment groups compared using two -sided unstratified log rank tests  (secondary)  and a 
proportional hazard model  (primary)  to include the above cited baseline covariates .  
 
NRX -101_003  Page [ADDRESS_474814]  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed by [CONTACT_379311]:  
• Dose per treatment group  
• Suicide rates  
• Proportion of participants  who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proportion of participants  who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages  
• Efficacy for each BPI [CONTACT_12245].  
Dose per treatment group will be displayed graphically over time per study treatment group . The 
percent decreasing and increasing over time relative to starting dose will be displayed per study 
treatment group.  
Time to all -cause study discontinuation and time to discharge will be displayed using a Kaplan -
Meier lifetable.  
The following t hree measure s will  be separately evaluated using a two-sided Fisher Exact test to 
compare treatments : 
• the need to implement a new treatment plan . 
• an increase in  suicidal ideation (a score of >4 on the C -SSRS, emergent suicidality 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) . 
• an increase in depressive symptoms (a score increase of ≥5 for two consecutive visits on 
the MADRS  total score) .  
The incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379261] a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test 
to compare each study treatment group.  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 55 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 The proportions of participants  discontinuing SSRIs or reducing SSRI dosages will be displayed 
graphically over time per study treatment group . The percent discontinuing SSRIs and reducing 
SSRI dosages relative to starting dose will be displayed per study treatment group.   
16.8.9  Safety Endpoints  
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_61132] . For each study treatment, safety data will be 
collected and analyzed while on treatment or until treatment -emergent adverse events are resolved . 
The type, incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of AEs will be reported for 
treatment -emergent and SAEs . Reasons for withdrawal due to AEs will also be reported . 
Narratives will be written for every AE classified as serious or associated with attempted suicide 
or death .  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using two -sided Fisher Exact tests to compare overall 
adverse event incidence for NRX -101 vs. lurasidone. Mean changes from randomization baseline 
will be displayed for each serum chemistry and hematology parameter as well as the shift; unpaired 
t-tests will be used to compare treatments . In addition, paired t -tests will be performed for the 
changes from randomization baseline for each study treatment group.  
Vital signs and ECGs (means and mean changes from baseline will also be evaluated within 
treatment groups using paired t -tests and between study treatment  groups using unpaired t -tests. 
Percent with abnormal vital signs, heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT, and 
QTcF will be reported. McNemar paired comparison  tests will be performed within study 
treatment groups for the abnormal discordant percent while two -sided Fisher Exact tests will be 
performed to compare incidences between treatment  groups.  
Blood draws for chemistries and hematologies will be evaluated within and between study 
treatment groups. Abnormality rates will be presented relative to established site -specific normal 
ranges and whether or not the abnormality is clinically significant . McNemar paired comparison 
tests will be performed within study treatment groups for the abnormal  percents while two -sided 
Fisher Exact tests will be performed to compare incidences between treatment groups.

other documents for consideration for participation, and clinical study mo nitors may make a Site 
Qualification Visit prior to completing the evaluation process . Upon completion of this evaluation, 
the sponsor will invite the chosen sites for participation.  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 56 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 Prior to patient  enrollment, a study initiation visit will be completed at each investigational site to 
ensure the following : IRB approval has been obtained and documented prior to patient  screening, 
the investigators and study personnel are appropriately trained and clearly understand the study, 
and the investigators and study personnel accept the obligations incurred in undertaking this 
clinical investigation . Due to the current COVID -[ADDRESS_474816] one rater approved for each clinician -administered instrument  (See Appendix 3 : Rater 
Training Manual ). 
Qualified clinical monitors will conduct investigational site monitoring visits on a routine basis to 
ensure that all investigators conduct the study in compliance with the protocol and applicable 
regulations. These monitoring visits may be virtual visits video/teleconference visits . The site will 
receive notification prior to each monitoring visit during the course of the study . It is expected that 
the investigator and/or sub -investigator and other appropriately trained study staff are available on 
the day  of the visit in case any questions may arise.  Due to the Pandemic situation, sites may also 
provide a secure access to portions of electronic medical records, and or upload  de-identified 
information onto a secure platform.  
Periodic monitoring visits will be made in accordance with the approved monitoring plan at all 
active study sites throughout the clinical study to ensure that the investigator obligations are being 
fulfilled and all applicable regulations and guidelines are being followed . These visits will assess 
continued acceptability of the facilities , ensure the protocol and investigational plan are being 
followed, the IRB has been notified of approved protocol changes as required, complete records 
are being maintained , appropriate and timely reports have been made to the sponsor, CRO, and the 
IRB, and the site ’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_379262].  
The sponsor retains the right to remove either the Principal I nvestigator or the investigational site 
from the study for issues of non -compliance with the protocol or regulatory requirements.  
On one or more occasion, the study site may be inspected or audited by [CONTACT_379312] a third party. The investigator will be informed in advance of th e visit(s). 
Upon completion of the clinical study (when all participants  at the site have completed follow up 
visits, all data has been entered in EDC and cleaned, all queries resolved, and final electronic 
signatures have been obtained), a study closeout visit will be performed . Any unused study 
materials and equipment will be collected and returned to the depot . The monitor will help to 
ensure that the investigator’s regulatory files are up to date and complete and that any outstanding 
issues from previous visits hav e been resolved. Other issues that will be reviewed at this visit 
 
NRX -101_003  Page 57 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 include: discussing retention of study files, possibility of site audits, publication policy, and 
ensuring that the investigator will notify the IRB regarding study closeout.  
17.[ADDRESS_474817] (IRB)  
The study protocol and any amendments will be reviewed by [CONTACT_2717]. The IRB will review the 
informed consent form, their updates (if any), and any written materials given to the participants .  
IRB approval will be obtained and documented prior to patient  enrollment and screening. Before 
study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval from the IRB for the 
protocol, consent form, patient  recruitment materials/process (e.g., advertisements), and any other 
written information to be provided to participants . 
The investigator will provide the IRB with reports, updates, and other information (e.g., Safety 
Updates, Amendments, and Administrative Letters) according to regulatory requirements and 
Institution procedures.  
A detailed list of required regulatory documents to be submitted to the CRO and/or sponsor, will 
be sent upon final approval of the protocol.

Source data are all the information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_2149], observations, laboratory reports, and data sheets provided by [CONTACT_162849], that are necessary for the re construction and evaluation of the study. The 
investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s), and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records.  
All study records will be retained for at least two years following the date on which the drug is 
approved by [CONTACT_379313] . In other situations (e.g., where the investigation is not in support of or as part of an 
application for a research or marketing permit), the requirement will be two years following the 
date on which the entire clinical program is completed, terminated, or  discontinued, or when the 
investigational app lication under which the investigation is being conducted is terminated or 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_50756].  
 
NRX -101_003  Page 58 of 75 09 NOVE MBER  2023  
 In the event the site’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1496], relocates or for any other reason withdraws 
from the responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, custody of the 
records may be transferred to any other person who will accept responsibility for the records . 
Notice of such a transfer must be given in writing to the Sponsor . The Investigator must contact 
[CONTACT_379314].  
18.2 Reporting Study Data  
The eCRF is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports . The eCRF will be  used to capture 
all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record  that is applicable to this study . The eCRF 
must be kept current to reflect patient status during the course of the study.  
All protocol -required information collected during the study must be entered by [CONTACT_737], 
or designated representative, in the eCRF, an Internet -based electronic data collection system . All 
details regarding  eCRF completion and correction will be explained to the investigator . The eCRF 
includes edit check and query systems that seamlessly integrate with the data entry system . All 
modifications to the data in the eCRF are tracked by [CONTACT_121755] (date and identity of 
the person making th e change are instantaneously recorded) . The e CRF is 21CFR Part [ADDRESS_474818] be provided for all missing 
data, altered data, and/or out of range data.  
The completed eCRF  must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_779]’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_4388] a

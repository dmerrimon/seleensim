3.0  INVESTIGATORS AND STUDY ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE  
Hollister Incorporated is the Sponsor and financer of this clinical study.  The Principal In vestigator (PI), Sub -
Investigator(s) (Sub -I), and study administrative team (data manager, statistician, etc.) are employees of the 
Sponsor. Hollister Incorporated is the acting clinical site for this at-home panel study.  
3.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_34511] -I to follow applicable Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and 
regulations including: complying with the protocol procedures, overseeing enrollment of appropriate 
subjects, addressing subjects’ questions or conce rns, evaluating and reporting Adverse Events (AE), 
ensuring Informed Consent is properly obtained, and retaining all study related documents for  
 (or according to local authorities guidelines on record retention) once the study is officially 
closed.  
3.[ADDRESS_632154] of the clinical 
study and veri fy study procedures are adhered to by [CONTACT_737](s). The Sponsor will also maintain 
accurate product accountability and maintain shippi[INVESTIGATOR_491496]. Hollister Incorporated 

may transfer any or all trial -related duties and functions to a CRO or vendor, but the ultimate responsibility

 technology , Hollister plans to  collect feedback from end users  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_632155] is  packaged as a box of thirty ( 30), 
indiv idually wrapped ,  single -use, hydrophilic  intermittent  catheters . 

 
The study product shall be used with end users who currently use a  IC product or have sampled a 
 IC according to protocol procedures, self -catheterize a minimum of , and are 
familiar with how to properly use an IC per the Instructions For Use (IFU).  This study is considered of 
minimal risk in that the anticipated risks of h arm are no greater, considering probability and magnitude, 
than those ordinarily encountered in the daily routine of the subjects.  This d efinition is consistent with 
21CFR §§ 56.102(i).  
 
The study product  to be used in this study is .  Class II devices are those 
for which general controls alone are insufficient to assure safety and effectiveness, and a dditional existing 
methods are available to provide such assurances. Therefore, Class II devices are also subject to special 
controls in addition to the general controls of Class I devices. Special controls may include special labeling 
requirements, mandat ory performance standards, and post market surveillance.  Devices in Class II are 
held to a higher level of assurance than Class I devices to insure that they will perform as indicated and 
will not cause injury or h arm to patient or user.

9.[ADDRESS_632170]’s desire to continue parti cipation will be conveyed to them in a timely manner. These 

procedures are expressed in the ICF that the subject signs. Subjects electing to withdraw from the study 
are required to return all unused study product.  
 
The Investigator may discontinue a subjec t from the study at any time without prejudice.  
Discontinuations are documented on  in the EDC system.  
Furthermore, the Sponsor may end the study at any time.   
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a subject, which does not necessarily 
have to be related to the device under investigation .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom, or disease experienced  while also using the device, whether or not considered related to the 
device.   
• Based on literature evaluation, expected adverse events that could occur in subjects recruited for this 
study include :  
 
 These are possible risks  with any 
intermittent cathete r usage on the market and are not unique for the study product.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is one that results in death, results in life -threatening illness or injury, requires in -
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], results i n medical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment, or results in permanent impairment of body structure or function, or that result in injury or death to 
a fetus.    
• There are no SAE related to the study product anticipated in this study.  
 
An Unantic ipated Adverse Event (UAE) occurs when the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the known or foreseeable risk of the anticipated adverse events associated with the study product 
or procedures involved with this research.  
10.[ADDRESS_632171] should be discontinued from the study.  

10.2 Reporting Adverse Events  
Unanticipated Adverse Events (UAE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) related to the study product must 
be reported by [CONTACT_91564] -Investigator through the EDC system within  by 
[CONTACT_491504] . 
 
Investig ators are also required to submit a report of SAE to IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later 
than  after the investigator first learns of the event  (Guidance for Clinical Practice Adverse 
Event Reporting to IRB s Improving Human Subject Protection , 2009) . 
10.[ADDRESS_632172] information will be treated as Protected Health Information and not 
included in any data set for analysis.  All datasets for study analysis will include only de -identified data.  
 
The electronic ICF and electronic case report forms (eCRFS) will be collected directly from research subjects using 
a secure, cloud -based EDC and electronic patient r eported outcomes (ePRO) system .   will 
be configured by [CONTACT_491505] -specific data c apture.  Study  forms such as the Adverse 
Event Form , Protocol Deviation Form , and Contact [CONTACT_491506] .  
 
Subjects will be provided with a link to the EDC/ePRO system via an email, as each study form is made available 
to them to complete.  Subjects will set up their own, secure password to the system  and that password remains  
unknown to the S ponsor. The  EDC will provide an audit log that verifies that all ePRO data were entered 
by [CONTACT_256864]. The audit log will also document when and by [CONTACT_491507].  
 
To the best of the Sp onsor’s ability, data logic and validation checks will be configured in the ePRO system so that 
subjects will receive warning messages at time of entry regarding inconsistent or invalid entries, in order to assure 
quality and completeness of data. Because the study collects self -report data directly from the study participants, 
there will be minimal corrections or modifications by [CONTACT_491508]. Any modification of any ePRO 
data will only be done following direct contact [CONTACT_491509] e research subject. There will be no 
modification to any data capturing subject opi[INVESTIGATOR_491497].  The Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_491510], such as date of first study product use, or any unclear responses on  the ICF and the 
Eligibility Screener, to assure proper and full consent of subjects, as well as confirmation of eligibility before study 

enrollment.  The Sponsor will contact [CONTACT_491511] a change in their health status, 
in order  to assure subject safety while using the study product.  
 
Access and permissions to the EDC system for data entry, approval signatures, and/or data export are controlled 
by [CONTACT_491512], which are provisioned by [CONTACT_1034]. Investigators and other study 
personnel are trained by [CONTACT_491513].  The Study Investigator will electronically sign all study data captured in the EDC, 
 prior to data export and analysis.  
12.[ADDRESS_632173] assessment data will be eligible for analysis; subjects who screen 
fail or did not provide any s tudy product assessment data will be excluded from analysis.  
12.[ADDRESS_632174] prior to loss -to-follow -up will be u sed for analysis. No imputation of missing data will be 
performed.  
12.3 Multi -Center and Multiple Comparison/ Multiplicity Adjustments  
Data collected from all study sites will be combined and analyzed as a whole. No multi -center adjustments 
will be made.  
12.[ADDRESS_632175] e Size and Power  
A sample size of  end-users was chosen to attain a margin of error of approximately . Assuming a 
 dropout rate, up to  end users will be enrolled to reach a target final sample size of up to  
13.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
13.1 Primary and Secondary Objective  
Study data collected will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods as defined by [CONTACT_491514]’s 
data level (i.e. continuous, ordinal, categorical, etc .). This includes but is not limited to frequency and 
percentages for categorical measures and mean [standard deviations] for continuous measures . 
 
13.[ADDRESS_632176]: 1) 
 subjects have provide d product assessment data via the end of study questionnaire or 2) the study 
reaches .  All subject data that has been gathered and released  on or prior 
to this milestone  will be included in the interim analysis.  
 Any amendments will be documented per Section 
17.0. 

14.[ADDRESS_632177] of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/  amendment(s) 
procedures, GCP, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
All data collected for this study is subject self -report data via ePRO questionnaire, and therefore there will be no 
source documents for monitoring.  To the best of the Sponsor’s ability, data logic and validation checks will be 
configured in the EDC ePRO module so that subjects will receive warning messages at time of entry about 
inconsistent or invalid entries, in order to assure quality and completeness of data. Since  the study collects 
 there will be minimal corrections or modifications by [CONTACT_491515]. Any modification of ePRO data will only be done following direct contact [CONTACT_491516]. 
There will be no modific ation to any data capturing subject opi[INVESTIGATOR_491498].  The Sponsor 
may contact [CONTACT_1130] s to clarify factual data, such as date of first study product application, or any unclear 
responses on the ICF and the Eligibility Screener, to ass ure proper and full consent of subjects, as well as 
confirmation of eligibility before study enrollment.  The Sponsor will contact [CONTACT_491517] a change in their health status, in order to assure subject safety while using th e study product.  
17.0 AMENDMENT PROCEDURES  
The Sponsor is responsible for initiating any protocol amendments. The amendments will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_491499]. Investigator(s) are notified of changes, and a copy of t he 
amendment is kept in the TMF.

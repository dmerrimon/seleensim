Date: 03-Oct-[ADDRESS_305682] require ments, and updates 
the sample size determination, populations for analyses and interim 
analy sis sections. Other changes were made to resolve minor 
inconsistencies and clarifications:
•Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the urinary tract. 
Immu notherapy with Bacillus Calmette -Guerin in patients with 
superficial urothelial carcinoma is part of the standard treatment. It has 
been shown that CD8 tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are 
predictive of survival in muscle -invasive urothelial carcinoma . Active 
immunotherapeutic strategies have been investigated for bladder 
cancer including CTLA -4 blockade. In conclusion, a check point 
inhibito r therapy  with nivolumab or nivolumab in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251294] a promising experimental appr oach for 
patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. This amendment adds a 
cohort enrolling subjects with advanced bladder cancer to the protocol 
aligned with the existing study design.
•Adjustments to the treatment guidelines for subjects who experience
endocrinopathy events are implemented. Subjects who experience 
endocrinopathy events which resolve or are adequately controlled with 
physiologic ho rmone replacement (steroids, thyroid hormones) or 
glucose controlling agents, may undergo retreatment. A rec urrence of 
the endocrinopathy event under ongoing physiologic hormone 
replacement therapy appears to be unlikely what justifies a retreatment 
with potential therapeutic benefit.
•The definition of the all immunogenicity population was changed in 
order to align it with the core safety SAP for the Nivolumab program. 
Other minor changes in the populations for analyses were made in 
order to align it with the SAP for 032.
•The interim analysis section was updated to allow for IAs based on 
either a “super” response or if it is necessary to make decisions 
regarding further development (e g,the SCLC cohort).

BMS -936558 / BMS -734016 nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251303] -escalating Safety Evaluation Phase for Combination Arm: Although the regimen currently used in the 
phase 3 melanoma study, nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg, was expect ed to also be tolerable in the 
tumors studied here, an initial dose-escalating safety evaluation for the combinatio n arms wasconducted with GC, 
PC, TN BC, or SCLC (described in protocol Section 3.1.3) . The BC cohort wasadded to this protocol following the
completion of the safety  evaluations in GC, PC, TNBC, and SCLC at dose level 1 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
1mg/kg) which did not reveal safety concerns . Thereby [CONTACT_251584] 2 
(nivolumab 1 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg). Six BC patients were initially randomized to Dose Level 2 ,after which 
enrollment to Dose Level 2b ( nivolumab 3 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg) began .
Enrollment to Stage 1 for Arm N occur redin parallel to the safety evaluation for Arm N -I.
Two Stage Design: GC, PC, TNBC, or SCLC Arms N and N-I will follow a two-stage design to test whether 
nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251304] (ORR) that is of 
clinical interest in the investigated tumor types. For each tumor type, only treatment arms which meet an 
ORR threshold will proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (described in protocol Section 3. 1.4). Enrollment to Stage 2 in a 
given treatment arm can continue even if the other treatment arm is still in Stage 1.
Table 1: Efficacy criteria to proceed from Stage [ADDRESS_305684] confirmed PR or CR. No Go into Stage 2
For Stage 2, upon completion of enrollment of the initial 40 subjects, additio nal subjects may be assigned into 
Arm N and Arm N -I up to a total of 100 subjects (including those assigned in Stage 1) in each treatment arm of the 
given tumor ty pe. For tumor types where nivolumab monotherapy  or nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg 
proceeded to Stage 2, assessment of Dose Level 2b in Stage 2 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, n=up to 
70subjects) may be initiated for that tumor ty pe.For SCLC, an ad ditional 250 subjects (second -or third-line) will 
be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of the 2 expansion groups: nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or nivolumab 
1mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg.
Modified D esign for Bladder Cancer Cohort:
Bladder arms Nand N-I (Dose Levels 2 and 2b) will be conducted as a One Stage Design with the treatment of 
26-105 subjects in each arm. The Safety Evaluation Phase for the N-I arm will start at Dose Level 2 (nivolumab 
1mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg) and will evaluate safety and tolerability after the first 6randomized subjects. 
Following the N -I safety  evaluatio n phase, Dose Level 2 will treat approximately 92subjects and 2b will treat up to 
a total of 105subjects. Based onthe safety evaluations thus far on study, no dose escalation phase is necessary  for 
bladder cohort N -I Dose Level 2b (nivolumab 3 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg).
Modified Design for Ovarian Cancer Cohort:
Ovarian arm N-I (Dose Levels 2, 2b and 2c) will be con ducted as a One Stage Design with the treatment of 
40subjects in each arm. Due to the low risk of development of new safety signals on the combination arms no safet y 
evaluation phase will be employed. Ovarian cancer subjects will be followed for related toxicities and decisions to 
stop treatment will be made on an ongoing basis.
Design for Additional Pancreatic Cancer Cohort:
Enrollment in the additional pancreatic cancer cohort will be initiated for one dose level N-Iin combination with 
cobimetinib (Dose Level 2d) and will be conducted as a One Stage Design with the treatment of approximately 
30subjects in one arm. Given that the toxicity profile of the combinatio n of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251305]-characterized and cobimetinib has demonstrated a toler able profile when combined with an similar agent in the 
PD-1/PD -L1 pathway, as well as that cobimetinib does not have overla ppi[INVESTIGATOR_251306], the combinatio n of these 3 agents is not expected to increase frequency and/or severity  of drug 
associated to xicitie s.Pancreatic cancer subjects will be followed for related toxicities and decisions to stop treatment 
will be made on an ongoing basis.

SCLC expansion:
SCLC cohorts Arm N and Arm N-I met the pre-specified safety and efficacy criteria andproceeded to Stage 2. 
Based on an interim data review, disease control rates (SD + PR + CR) of 36% and 57% for Arms N and N-I, 
respectively, were estimated. In order to further investigate nivolumab and nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251308], the SCLC expansion cohorts will enroll additional subjects based on 
response to prior treatment and the number of previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Up to [ADDRESS_305687] line subjects will be 
randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of 2 expansion g roups: Arm A (150 subjects treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg ever y

(1 vs 2 prior chemotherapy regimens). The crossover option refers only to the original cohorts and not the new 
cohorts enrolled under or after Amendment 09 implementation.
Crossover for subjects in Arm N :Subjects in Arm N may  crossover to Arm N -I if all of the following criteria are 
met:
The Safety  Evaluation Phase for the N -I regimen has been completed and at least [ADDRESS_305688] been exposed

assessment completed , subjects for cross over will be assigned to Dose Level 2b.
Subject has confirmed radiologic disease progression (investigator -assessed RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_305689] 4 weeks after the initia l tumor assessment showing progr ession) in the absence of clinical 
deterioration . For subjects with clear evidence of new or progressing brain metastases a confirmation is not 
required. These subjects may proceed with brain radiation therapy  and after having completed the radiation 
therapy  a cross over to Arm N -I can be considered.
Subjects with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_251309] r and investigator.

Study Assessments:
Tumor assessments
The primary endpoint of this study, ORR ,is based on tumor assessments at baseline and then at 6weeks from first 
dose.Tumor assessments continue every 6weeks for the first 24weeks and every 12weeks thereafter while on 
treatment or on treatment hold for any reason until disease progression (investigator -assessed RECIST 1.1-defined 
progression) or treatment discontinuation ,except for subjects treated beyond progression or who discontinued 
treatment for oth er reasons than PD.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size Determination
Sample size determination in the orig inal protocol
This study comprises a Dose Escalating Safety Evaluation Phase for the Combination Arm, followed by a Staged 
Enrollment for Arm N, and Arm N -I. 
In the original protocol, gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer 
areincluded and the Staged Enrollment Part utilize sa modified Simon two-stage design with the treatment of 
40subjects to evaluate whether nivolumab, or the combination of nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251311] (ORR) that is of clinical interest. In this study,  an ORR of 10% or less is considered not of clinical 
value, and an ORR of 25% or greater is considered of strong clinical interest. The modified Simo n design evaluates 
the null hy pothesis that the true response rate is 10% versus the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is 
> 10%. The 2 -stage testing within each cohort targets a Type I error rate of 5% and has 80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis if the true response rate is 25%.
Sample size det ermination for bladder cancer cohort

19.6% response rate if the true response rate is 35% with a two-sided Ty pe I erro r rate of 5%.
Sample size determination for SCLC expansion cohort
In Amendment 09, in addition to the original two -stage design of SCLC subjects, additional SCLC expansion cohort 
subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of 2 expansion groups: Arm A (150 subjects, nivolumab mono) or 
Arm B (100 subjects, nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) and willbe stratified for number of prior treatment 
lines (1 vs 2 prior chemotherapy regimens). 
Based on SCLC data so far observed in t his study  with an ORR of about 10% for nivolumab monotherapy and about 
23% for nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976], sample sizes of N = 150 for nivolumab monotherapy and 
N =100 for nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976]  (nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi [INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) will target a 
TypeI error rate of 5% (two -sided) and will have 78% power to detect the difference between these two arms, if the 
true ORR rates are 10% and 23%, respectively.
Sample size determination for ovarian cancer cohort
Also in Ame ndment 09, an ovarian cancer cohort isadded and a one stage design with the treatment of 40 subjects 
for each arm is used. These sample sizes provide 79% power to reject the null hypothesis of 10% response rate if the 
true response rate is 25% with a two -sided Ty pe I error rate of 5%.
Sample size determination for the additional pancreatic cancer cohort
In this Amendment, pancreatic cancer cohort is re-opened and one stage design with the treatment of 30subjects 
will be used. Th issample size will provide 70% power to reject the null hy pothesis of 10% response rate if the true 
response rate is 25% with a two -sided Ty pe I erro r rate of 5%.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Nivo lumab (BMS -936558; anti-PD-1 mAb) is a fully human monoclonal immunogl obulin (Ig) 
G4 antibody  that binds to the programmed death -1 (PD-1) cell surface membrane receptor, a 
negat ive regulatory  molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocy tes. Inhibit ion of the 
interact ion between PD -1 and its ligands pro motes immune responses and ant igen-specific T cell 
responses to both forei gn ant igens as well as self ant igens. PD -1 receptor bl ockade by [CONTACT_179491] a new approach for immunotherapy  of tumors. Results from a Phase 1/2 study  (CA209003)1
indicate that nivolumab is active in multiple tumor types. Nivo lumab 3mg/kg monotherapy  is 
currently approved for the treatm ent of advanced melanoma and non-small -cell lung cancer, 
meta static renal carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma, and is being studi ed in several Phase 3 and 
2 clinical trials in advanced and metastatic solid and hematologic malignancies.

1.1 Study Rationale
Study  CA209032 is an open label multi-center Phase 1/[ADDRESS_305701] cancer (TNBC), gastri c cancer (GC), pancreatic adenocarcino ma 
(PC), sm allcell lung cancer (SCLC), bladder cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) .
1.1.[ADDRESS_305702] Cancer (TNBC)
Breast cancer is classified by [CONTACT_251590] n of horm one 
receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) as well as the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392] 2(HER2).12Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive disease characteri zed by [CONTACT_251591]/PR and HER2 expressio n. TNBC is mostly of the basal type and accounts for 
15 -20% of  cases of breast cancer.13,14Most BRCA1 mutation associ ated tumors are basal type 
and tri ple-negat ive.15
While TNBC is not responsive to horm onal or HER2- targeted agents, these tumors are 
responsive to anthra cycline/taxane based chem otherapy  in the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant setting 
which may induce complete pathol ogical response (pCR).16,17However, the majorit y of TNBC 
patients have residual disease with high risk of relapse and rapid decrease in survival within the 
[ADDRESS_305703] cancer prior-treated with anthracyclines

BMS -936558 / BMS -734016 nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251333] . In the subset of TNBC patients from a 752 patient trial with anthracycline/taxane 
pre-treated breast cancer patients, improved PFS (4.2 vs 1.7 months for ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_251334], HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.77, P < 0.000 1) and 
ORR (27%) was observed.20In the Phase 3 EMBRACE study  (N = 762), of eribulin versus 
treatm ent of  physician’s choi ce (TPC), eribulin dem onstrated stati stically significant OS increase 
(median OS13versus 11months, HR = 0.81, P = 0.041).21In TNBC patients, the experimental 
arm conferred a 29% decreased risk of death.[ADDRESS_305704] atinum -based regimens and PARP inhibitors (olaparib, iniparib, BSI -201) 
have shown promising resul ts in TNBC, particularly in associ ation with BRCA -mutation in the
tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy (bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib) 
have also shown some activity.23However, true estimat ion of benefit  from large trials is still 
awaited.
Establishing a standard of care with significant benefi t in metastati c TNBC with prior 
anthracycline/taxane failure is an urgent unmet need. Immunotherapy  may provide a path 
forward. A meta -analysis of [ADDRESS_305705] percentage (18%) of samples positive for PD-L1 expressio n. 
Therefore, a monotherapy  with a checkpo int inhibitor or thecombinat ion of check -point 
inhibitor slike nivolumab may offer improved benefit for metastatic TNBC.
1.1.2 Rationale for Investigating Unresectable Locally Advanced or 
Metastatic Limited or Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
SCLC accounts for 15 - 20% of new cases of lung cancer, and nearly 33,900 new cases are 
expected in the US in 2012. 25SCLC is traditionally classified as Limi ted Stage Disease 
(LD- SCLC -tumor tissue enco mpassed within a single radiat ion port) and Extensive Stage 
Disease (ED-SCLC -tumor that extends beyo nd the boundaries of a  single radiat ion port).[ADDRESS_305706] ED-SCLC and are treated 
with four to six cycles of plat inum plus etoposide (PE) which remains the standard chemotherap y 
regimen for LD-and ED-SCLC. Initial response rate is robust with 70-90% response seen in 
LD-SCLC and 50 -70% response seen in ED -SCLC.27Whenever, overall survival remains poor 
with median survival for LD-SCLC at 18-[ADDRESS_305707] line therapy, about 80% LD-LSC patients and all of ED-SCLC 
patients have disease progressi on.30Patients whose response after first line platinum -based

between two arms (25 weeks vs 24.7 weeks). 31
New treatments for SCLC are requi red. An analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) from SCLC patients has shown that T-effector cells are more in LD-SCLC compared 
to ED -SCLC subjects and long-term survivors of SCLC have a higher T-effector to T-regulator 
ratio.32In a Phase [ADDRESS_305709] atin and pacli taxel (5.7 months vs 4.6months, 
HR=0.72, P =0.05), though there was no improvement when used concurrently.33Nivo lumab 
at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg has been shown to be effective against NSCLC in a Phase 1study 
(N=122) with ORR of 6%, 27%, and 17% and PFS rates at 24 weeks of 25%, 44%, 
and31%.34,35Considering the immune response seen in SCLC patients, and the resul ts of

that nivolumab alone or in combinat ion withipi[INVESTIGATOR_251337] -lineand further lines of treatm ent of SCLC.
1.1.3 Rationale for Investigating Unresectable Locally Advanced or 
Metastatic Gastric and Gastro -Esophageal -Junction Cancer (GC)
Globally , gastri c cancer is the 4th leading cancer with over 900,[ADDRESS_305710] ion (GEJ) cancer 
anatomically straddles the distal  esophagus and proximal stomach. Due to the location and since 
the majorit y of GEJ tumors are adenocarcino mas, these tumors are frequent ly grouped togeth er 
with gastric cancer. Until optimal treatm ent strategies are defined, advanced and metastati c 
GEJ cancer is treated and managed in a similar fashio n to gastric cancer.37,38
Gastri c cancer often presents with advanced disease upon diagnosis (except in count ries like 
Japan and Korea where early detecti on is common). In about 20-30% of cases, subjects will 
present with resectable disease but in many of these, intraoperative discovery of lymph node 
metastasis is commo n and where curat ive surgery is possible, the recurrence rate after resection 
is high. For subjects devel opi[INVESTIGATOR_251338] c disease, the reported 1-year survival  is 
approximately 30%.39With first-line treatm ent, the median survival for these subjects is 
approximately  [ADDRESS_305711]-line therapy woul d include S1, 5FU or capecitabine for the fluroropy rimidine 
agent, and cisplat in or oxaliplat in for the platinum agent. Of note, no do ublet combinat ion of 
fluroropy rimidine plus platinum has been demonstrated to be superi or to another in a 
Phase 3randomized controlled trial in terms of efficacy although there are reported differences 
in the toxicity profiles between the regimens.43,44Though the resul ts of the V325 Phase 3 trial

progression with a  small improvement in median survival , this is at the expense of increased 
toxicity.45As a consequence, doce taxel  is limited to the first line treatment of gastric cancer.
Trastuzum ab has been shown to have survival benefi t in combination with chemotherapy for 
Her2 positive gastri c cancer and improved median survival to 13.8 months.46This treatm ent is 
only applicable to those who exhibi t Her2 posi tive disease com prising 10 -30% of  all the gastri c 
cancer populat ion.[ADDRESS_305712] line platinum -fluoropy rimidine based chem otherapy there is an 
urgent m edical need to find new therapeutic approa ches. In gastric cancer, CTLA -4 blockade has 
been reported to induce antitumor response. Tremelimumab, a fully humanized anti-CTLA4 
monoclonal antibody  was assessed for its activi ty as second -line treatm ent for subjects with 
gastri c cancer.48In a Phase 2 tri al trem elimumab was administered on a 3 -monthly schedule to a 
small group (n = 18) of  subjects. Although the objective response rate was noted to be only 5%, 
the median survival was 4.8 months similar to other reported second -line chem otherapi[INVESTIGATOR_251340]. Therefore, a checkpo int inhibitor (nivo lumab) alone or in combinat ion with each 
other (nivo lumab plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) may offer improved benefit for patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic Gastric and Gastro -Esophageal -Juncti on Cancer.
1.1.4 Rationa le for Investigating Unresectable Locally Advanced or 
Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Cancer (PC)
Pancreat ic adenocarcino ma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer with rising incidence during 
the past several decades. It is estimated that 45,200 new cases will be diagnosed and 
38,460 people will die of pancreatic carcino ma in the [LOCATION_002] in 2013.49The 1-year and 
5-year survival rates for newly diagnosed patients are 15% and < 5% respectively.50
Radical surgery  in early stage di sease (Stage I and some Stage II) m aybe the only treatm ent wi th 
curative intent in pancreatic cancer.51For locally advanced or metastati c disease (Stage IV), 
gemcitabine has been the standard of care with a  m edian survival of 6.2months and a 1year 
survival rate of 20%.52The Phase3 PRODIGE trial [N=342] comparing FOLFIRINOX 
(combinat ion of 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) to gemcitabine in metastatic

Bladder cancer is the most commo n malignancy  of the urinary  tract. Five percent (5%) of the 
patients have Stage IV disease at presentation.60Immunotherapy  with Bacillus Calmette -Guerin 
in patients wi th superficial urothel ial carcino ma reduces the risk of local recurrence by 60% and

lymphocy tes (TILs) are predictive of survival  in muscle -invasive urothelial carcino ma. Patients 
with advanced urothelial cancer (pT2, pT3, or pT4) and higher numbers of CD8 TILs wi thin the 
tumor (> 8) had better di sease -free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P =0.018) than did 
patients wi th similar -staged urothelial carcino ma and fewer intratumoral CD8 TILs.62

The term ovarian cancer includes not only epi[INVESTIGATOR_251348]. The latter two are less commo n neopl asms, which, however, are

32.5% for Stage IIIc, and 18.6% for Stage IV.69Whereas patients with platinum-sensi tive OC

observat ions and initial resul ts of a Phase 1b trial combining cobimet inib and anti-PD-[ADDRESS_305721] commo n toxic events associated with single- agent use of cobimet inib in Phase 1

Drug-drug interacti ons between nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251352]. It is 
not likely that other drugs will affect the PK of nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251353]4 monoclonal antibody , and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162546]1 monoclonal antibody, which are 
eliminated by [CONTACT_105]-specific catabo lism (often by [CONTACT_251593]). This 
eliminat ion process is not known to be inhibi ted or induced by [CONTACT_34677] m olecule drugs. Nivolumab 
is also unlikely to im pact the PK of  other com panion dr ugs when used in combinat ion regimens. 
A Phase 1 study  in metastati c clear cell renal cell carcino ma (CA209009) demonstrated that 
nivolumab at all dose levels (0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg) did not modulate cytokine levels (IL6, IL2, 
and IL10). Because no change in cytokine level was observed, nivolumab is not considered to 
mediate CYP induct ion, and has no or l ow potenti al for m odulating CYP enzymes, and thereby a 
low risk of interacti on with small molecule drugs. Similarly, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251354]-drug interacti on with cobimet inib because ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], as a monoclonal antibody  is 
unlikely  to have an effect on CYPs or other drug -metabo lizing enzymes.

Nivolumab Monotherapy
CA209003 is an ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_305722] previously treated advanced solid tumors, including melano ma, RCC, NSCLC, colorecta l 
cancer, and horm one-refractory  prostate cancer. Subjects received nivolumab at doses of 
0.1,0.3,1, 3,or 10mg/kg intravenously every  2weeks, up to a maximum of 2years of total 
therapy . As of 18-Mar-2013, a total of 306melanom a subjects were treated with nivolumab in 
the dose range of 0.1 - 10 mg/kg.
No m aximal tol erated dose was identified in CA209003. The incidence, severi ty and relat ionship 
of AEs were generally similar across dose l evels and tum or types. Nivolumab related AEs of any 
grade occurre d in 75.2% of subjects. Of the 306treated subjects, 303(99.0%) subjects have at 
least 1reported AE regardl ess of causali ty. The most frequent ly reported AEs were 
fatigue (54.9%), decreased appeti te(35.0%), diarrhea (34.3%), nausea (30.1%), and 
cough (29.4%). Treatment -related AEs were reported in 230(75.2%) of the 306subjects. The 
most frequent ly reported treatm ent-related AEs were fatigue (28.1%), rash (14.7%), 
diarrhea (13.4%), and pruri tus(10.5%). Most treatment -related AEs were low grade. 
Treatme nt-related high grade (Grade 3 -4) AEs were reported in 52 (17.0%) of subjects. The most 
commo n treatment -related hi gh grade AEs were fatigue (2.3%) and diarrhea (1%).
Drug -related SAEs occurred in 11.5% of subjects. Grade 3-[ADDRESS_305723] 2subjects included: diarrhea (3subjects, 1.0%), pneumonit is(3subjects, 1.0%), 
pneumo nia(2subjects, 0.7%) ,and lipase increased (2subjects, 0.7%).
Select AE categori es (events with a potenti al inflammatory  mechanism requiring more frequent 
monitoring and/or unique intervent ion such as immunosuppressants and/or endocrine 
replacement therapy ) include: GI AEs, pulmo nary AEs, renal AEs, hepat ic AEs, skin AEs, and 
endocrinopathies. In addition, Select AEs include a category for infusion react ions.Each 
category  is composed of a  discrete set of preferred terms, including those of greatest clinica l

Nivolumab Monotherapy
In CA209003 (MDX1106 -03), the clinical activi ty of nivolumab was demonstrated in a variet y 
of tumor ty pes and across a range of doses (0. 1mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg). 
As of  the clinical cut -off date of [ADDRESS_305741] 1.0, has been reported at all dose levels.
Amo ng 107 patients with advanced melano ma who received nivolumab, the preliminar y 
objective response rate was 33/107 (31%). Responses occurred at each dose level, with 
6/17 (35%), 5/18 (28%), 11/35 (31%), 7/17 (41%), and 4/20 (20%) melano ma subjects 
responding at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10mg/kg, respectively. Durati on of response range from

1.1.9 Rationale to Support Dose/Schedule of Nivolumab Combined with 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251385]209004, the 3 mg/kg nivolumab plus 3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251386]. In CA209004, while both Cohort 2 (1mg/kg nivolumab 
plus 3mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) and Cohort 2a (3 mg/kg nivolumab plus 1mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) had 
similar Week 24 PFS rate, a dose of 3mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43852]  3weeks for a total of 
fourdoses and 1 mg/kg ni volumab every 3 weeks for four doses foll owed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg 
every 2weeks until progressi on was chosen. Based on preliminary data, this group had a 
numerically  higher ORR than Cohort 2a, although the significance of this difference is not clear.
Therationale for m aximizing the i pi[INVESTIGATOR_251387] 
a well-defined dose and exposure response for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (10mg/kg > 3mg/kg > 0.3mg/kg). 
Incontrast, analysis of nivolumab monotherapy across dose ranges of 1mg/kg to 10mg/kg 
reveals similar clinical activi ty with no clear evidence of dose or exposure response. Therefore, 
the select ion of 3mg/kg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Cohort 2) may be more clinically  impactful than 
select ion of 3 mg/kg of nivo lumab (Cohort 2a).
The combinat ion arm in Study  CA209032 is expected to use the same dose and schedule as that 
in Cohort [ADDRESS_305743] 12weeks (nivo lumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg). 
This is the same regimen current ly being studi ed in the Phase [ADDRESS_305744] 12weeks since this is the current ly 
approved dosing regimen.
To ensure that this regimen is tolerable across other tumors, an initial dose escalat ing safety 
evaluat ion step for the combinat ion arm will be instituted. The starting dose in this evaluat ion 
will be 1 mg/kg each nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If this regimen is tolerable, then Dose level 2, 
1mg/kg nivolumab + 3mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251388]. The criteria for determining 
tolerabilit y are based on the AE profile observed for the combinat ion in CA209004.

at nivolumab 1mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg had grade 3-4 treatment related adverse events 
in 60.9% .9Medi an PFS based on an interim analysis was in the same range for both dose l evels. 
Similarly, data from a Phase1 study  of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251391] 3mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg dose level was 
well tolerated while sustaining clinical act ivity.10Based on these data ,Study CA209032 will also  
investigate th e nivo lumab 3 m g/kg plus i pi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg dose level.
Based on the clinical activity in CA209004, the majo rity of responses to the combinat ion of 
nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251392] 12weeks. Nivo lumab 3mg/kg monotherapy 
treatm ent every two week s until progressi on was studi ed in CA209003 and was associ ated with 
durable responses. Thus, starting at week 12, which is after the completion of the four doses of 
combined nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab at 3mg/kg will be administered every 
twoweek s unt il progression.
In summary , nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251393]. To further improve the tolerabili ty profile, other 
combinat ion dosing regimens were also explored in the nivolumab devel opment program. Less 
frequent dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 1 mg/kg q6week when given with nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2week 
was found to have a similar discont inuat ion rate to that observed in nivolumab monotherapy 
(11% vs 10%) while yielding a ORR of 39% and a 12-month PFS rate of 35% in preliminar y 
data f rom CA209012 in NSCLC . The median OS was 18.1 months.Based on these efficacy and 
safet y data, nivol umab 3 mg/kg q 2 weeks + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg q [ADDRESS_305745] used a 60 minute infusio n durat ion for 
nivolumab and 90 minute infusion durat ion for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 - 3 mg/kg dosing for both). 
However, both nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251394] 10 mg/kg with the 
same infusio n duration.
Nivo lumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg 
safely over long treatm ent durati on. In Study  CA209010, (a Phase 2, rando mized, double 
blinded, dose-ranging study  of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastati c clear cell 
RCC) a dose associ ation was observed for infusion site reacti ons and hypersensit ivity 
reacti ons (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were 
Grade 1 - 2 and were manageable. An infusio n durati on of approximately  30 minu tes for 3 
mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any 
safet y concerns com pared to the pri or experience at 10 m g/kg nivo lumab dose infused over a 
60 minute duration.

BMS -936558 / BMS -734016 nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251303]- escalation Safety Evaluation Phase for Combination Arm: Although theregimen 
currently used in the Phase 3 melanoma study , nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg, 
was expected to also be tolerable in the tumors studi ed here, an init ial dose-escalat ing safet y 
evaluat ion for the combinati on arms was conducted wi th GC, PC, TNBC, or SCLC (described in 
protocol  Section3.1.2 ). The BC cohort was added to thi s protocol  following the completion of 
the safet y evaluat ions in GC, PC, TNBC, and SCLC at dose level 1 (nivo lumab 1mg/kg, 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg) which did not reveal safet y concerns. Thereby [CONTACT_251598] 2 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg, i pi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg). Six BC patients were 
initially rando mized to Dose Level 2, after which enrollment to Dose Level 2b (nivo lumab 
3mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg) began.
Enrollment to Stage 1 for Arm N occur redin parallel to the safet y evaluat ion for Arm N -I.
Two Stage Design: GC, PC, TNBC, SCLC Arms will follow a two -stage desi gn to tes t whether 
nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251416] (ORR) that is of clinical interest in the investigated tumor ty pes. For each tumor ty pe, only 
treatm ent arms which meet an ORR threshol d will proceed from  Stage 1 to Stage 2 (described in 
protocol  Section3.1.3 ). Enrollment to Stage 2 in a given treatm ent arm can continue even if the 
other tre atment arm is still in Stage 1.
For Stage 2, upon complet ion of enrollment for the init ial 40 subjects, additional subjects maybe 
assigned into Arm N and Arm N-I up to a total of 100 subjects (including those assigned in 
Stage 1)in each treatm ent arm of the given tumor type. For tumor types where nivolumab 
monotherapy  or ni volumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg proceeded to Stage 2, assessment 
of Dose Level 2b in Stage 2 (nivo lumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg, n=up to 70subjects) 
may be init iated for that tum or ty pe.For SCLC, an addi tional 250subjects (second -or thi rd-line) 
will be rando mized in a 3:2 ratio to one of the 2 expansi on groups: nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 
2weeks or nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3weeks for 4 cycles followed by

3.1.1 Modified Design s
Bladder Cancer Cohort
The enrollment for the BC cohorts N and N-I (Dose Level 2b) will be conduc ted as a One Stage 
Design:
Recent ly, inhibit ion of PD-L1 by [CONTACT_34460]3280A was shown to have clinical activity in 
patients with metastati c urothelial bladder cancer , leading to approval of the drug in this 
indicat ion by [CONTACT_1622] .88The overall response rate in al l treated subjects was 15%.
Nivo lumab has recent ly demo nstrated m eaningful ant itumor activi ty with an overall response 
rate of 19.6% in all treated subjects
As these data show that checkpo int inhibit ion has potenti al to be an active treatm ent for 
patients with advanced bladder cancer, a Two Stage design with the intent of avoiding to 
expose too many patients to a potentially ineffect ive treatm ent does not appear to be 
necessary  for this specific tum or type.66

based on the resul ts of CA209003 and CA209012 clinical studi es menti oned above. The efficacy 
and tolerabili ty of nivolumab monotherapy  observed in CA209003 study with longer follow-up 
of previously treated NSCLC patients suggested a strategy  in which nivolumab serves as the 
“base” of a combinat ion regimen, with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251417]/or less

In the event of [ADDRESS_305763] 9 subjects requi ring perm anent discontinuati on,a discussi on wi th 
investigators may be held to review the risk/benefit of this regimen. The rationale for this 
evaluat ion is that the most frequent severe drug related AEs for the combinat ion in melano ma 
have been asymptom atic, reversible laboratory event s (ie,LFTs and lipase) and there is 
preliminary evidence of deep and durable responses in the N-I arm in advanced melano ma 
(CA209004). Therefore, a discussio n of the risk/benefit of the regimen will be triggered if the 
following criteria are met:
A majori ty of subjects who discont inue due to treatm ent related AEs have deep tumor 
response (ie ,> 80% reduction)
All treatm ent related AEs leading to discontinuation are non-fatal, reversible and without 
severe sequela (ie ,GI perforati on)
A majorit y of the treatment related AEs are laboratory  in nature, asymptomat ic, and 
monitorable via routine blood draws
If a decisi on is made to continue with a  regime n because of a favorable risk/benefit profile 
(ie,non-fatal AEs in subjects with near CRs that are durable) and despi[INVESTIGATOR_251426] ‘not

Arm N:For treatm ent Arm Nof the given tumor type that continues to Stage 2, addit ional 
subjects will be assigned to a total of 40 subjects, inclusive of those enrolled in Stage 1. For 
tumor ty pes where nivolumab monotherapy  proceeded to Stage 2, assessment of Dose Level 2b 
in Stage 2 (nivo lumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, n=40 subjects) will be init iated for that

3.1.4 SCLC E xpansion
SCLC cohorts Arm N and Arm N-I met the pre-specified safet y and efficacy criteria and 
proceeded to Stage 2. Based on an interim data review, disease control  rates (SD + PR + CR) of 
36% and 57% for Arms N and N-I, respectively, were estimated. In order to further invest igate 
nivolumab and nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251428], 
the SCLC expansi on cohorts will enroll additional subjects based on response to prior treatm ent 
and the number of previ ous therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. Up to 250second or third line subjects will be randomized
in a 3:2ratioto one of 2 expansio n groups: Arm A (150 subjects treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
every 2weeks (Q2W) )or Arm B (100 subjects treated withnivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 
mg/kg every  3weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg (Q2W )and will be 
stratified for number of prior t reatment lines (1 vs 2 prior chemotherapy regimens).
The study  popul ation for the SCLC expansio n cohort i s specified as fo llows:
Histopathol ogically or cy tologically confirmed di agnosis of SCLC.
All subjects had platinum -based first-line treatment. Subject s with previous second -line 
chemotherapy treatment are eligible as well.
Subjects with plat inum refractory , resi stant, or sensit ive disease are eligible.
Subjects with initial diagnosis of limit ed or extensive disease are eligible.
Docum ented obj ective rad iographic disease progressio n at study  entry .
Tumor assessments for subjects in the SCLC expansi on cohort willundergo a BICRassessment.
The crossover option refers only  to the ori ginal  cohorts and not the new cohorts enrolled under or 
after Am endment 09 .
3.1.5 Duration of Study T reatment
The study treatment will be continued until disease progressi on (invest igator -assessed 
RECIST 1.1-defined progressi on) or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity as defined in 
Secti on4.5.5 . For subjects achieving confirmed CR or a PR for more than 3months(long last ing 
PR) the invest igator may decide to hold treatment for this subject after discussio n with the 
medical monitor of the sponsor .During the treatm ent hold subje cts shoul d follow all study 
procedures as specified in Section5.1. Subjects for which treatm ent was held following long 
lasting responses and who experi ence a recurrence of disease progressi on may reinit iate thei rlast

3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibili ty to determine, based on subject attributes 
(eg,allergy history , diabet ic history  and renal status), the appropri ate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen for each subject. Imaging contraindicat ions and contrast risks shoul d be 
considered in this assessment. Subjects wi th renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether 
or not they shoul d receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropri ate. 
Specific to MRI, subj ects with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibros is. MRI 
contrast shoul d not be given to this subject populati on. In addition, subjects are excluded from 
MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.   
The ultimate decisio n to perform MRI in an individual subject in this study  rests with th e site 
radiologist, the invest igator and the standard set by [CONTACT_61857].
[IP_ADDRESS] Palliative Radiation Therapy
Palliat ive (limited -field) radiati on therapy is permitted for pain control  to si tes of bone disease or 
other non-target lesions present at baseline or new lesions. For subjects with new or progressing 
brain metastases or other lesions,except SCLC subjects from the expansi on cohorts under or 
after Amendment 09, radiation therapy is permi tted before a crossover to Arm N-I can be 
considered.
1)Bone and other metastases
a)For bone or other disease sites present at baseline or new , the lesion being considered for 
palliat ive radiat ion is not a target lesio n.
b)The case is discussed with the BMS medical monitor, and the medical monitor agrees 
that the condi tions requi red to receive palliat ive radiat ion are m et.
2)Brain metastases or other lesions
a)Subject is enro lled in the nivo lumab monotherapy  arm.
b)The case is discussed with the BMS medical monitor, and the medical monitor agrees 
that the condit ions req uired to receive palliat ive radiat ion are m et.
c)After completion of the brain or other lesions radiation therapy , the BMS Medical 
Moni tor m ust be consul ted before a cross over to Arm  N-I can be permi tted. Treatment in 
the cross over arm can only be started af ter there is no MRI evidence of progressi on for at 
least 2 weeks after brain r adiation treatment is co mplete.

treatm ent is resum ed.
Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately  controlled with only physi ologic horm one 
replacement or gl ucose controlling agents may resume treatm ent.
If the criteria to resume treatm ent are met, the subject shoul d restart treatm ent at the next 
scheduled timepo int per protocol. However, if the treatm ent is delayed past the scheduled 
timepo int per protocol, the scheduled study  treatment admini strati on will be delayed, but not 
skipped, until dosing resumes. In particular, this is to ensure that subjects in Arm N-I will 
receive [ADDRESS_305820]  
elapse between the replacement dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251462] h ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].
If treatm ent is delayed > 6weeks from the last dose, the subject must be perm anently 
discontinued fro m study  therapy , except as specified in Section 4.5.[ADDRESS_305821] ion4.5.3 .

Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic premedicat ions are reco mmended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50mg 
(orequivalent) and/or paracetam ol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30minutes before 
additional nivolumab or i pi[INVESTIGATOR_45782].

Stop the nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_186700] n, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetam ol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resol ution of symptom s. 
Corti costeroi d or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropri ate. If  the infusio n 
is interrupted, restart the infusi on at 50% of  the original infusio n rate when symptoms resolve; if 
no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the 
original infusio n rate. Moni tor subject closely. If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab or

Contrast -enhanced Computed Tom ography (CT) scans acqui red on dedicated CT equipment is 
preferred for this study . CT with contrast of the chest, abdomen and pelvis are to be perform ed 
for tumor assessments at baseline and beginning 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) from first dose and 
continuing every 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) 
thereafter, while on treatm ent or on treatm ent hold for any reason until disease progressi on and 
treatment discont inuation, whichever occurs later. Addit ionally, with the except ion of crossover 
participants, tumor assessments will not be required upon initiation of subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy .CT scans shoul d be acqui red with 5mm slices with no intervening gap (cont iguous).
Although a contrast enhanced CT in particular for the chest is the preferred technique, a contrast 
enhanced MRI may be used based on local standards.
Shoul d a subject have a contraindicat ion for CT IV contrast, a non -contrast CT of the chest and a 
contrast enhanced MRI of the abdo men and pelvis may be obtained. MRI’s shoul d be acqui red 
with slice thi ckness of £5 mm  with no gap (conti guous). 
Every  attempt shoul d be made to image each subject using an ident ical acquisit ion protocol  on 
the sam e scanner for all imaging time points.
Note: Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner:
Combined modality scanning such as with FDG-PET/CT is increasingly used in clinical care, 
and is a modality/techno logy that is in rapid evolution; therefore, therecommendat ions outlined 
here may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation correcti on CT 
porti ons of a combined FDG -PET/CT are of limited use in anatomically based efficacy 
assessments and it is therefore suggested that they should not be substi tuted for dedicated 
diagnosti c contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST measurements. However, 
if a site can docum ent that the CT perform ed as part of  a FDG -PET/CT i s of identical diagnostic 
qualit y to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT porti on of the FDG -PET/CT 
can be used for RECIST 1.1m easurements. Note, however, that the FDG -PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially 
perform ed.
MRI Brain
MRI or CT of brain is required at screening in order to rule out active metastatic disease. For 
patients with a history  of known brain metastasis, an MRI brain is requi red at baseline. A CT 
brain is not all owed for patients wi th known brain metastasis at baseline. Subjects wi th a history 
of brain metastasis shoul d have surveillance MRI approximately every [ADDRESS_305860], abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).
Best response would depend on whether minimum duratio n for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best

Does the mutational status of tumor cells (ie KRAS, EGFR) or tum or infect ivity (H. pylori, 
HPV) correl ate wi th clinical  efficacy to m onotherapy  or combinat ion therapy?
Can we define distinct pharmacodynamic markers of monotherapy  and combinat ion therapy 
in the peripheral co mpart ment?
How does monotherapy  or combinat ion therapy  alter the act ivating and negat ive 
costim ulatory  molecules on immune cells in the periphery and at the tumor site? Are there
distinct mechanisms o f resistance to monotherapy  and combinat ion therapy?
Is the intratum oral or peripheral T cell repertoi re predict ive of response to monotherapy  or 
combinat ion therapy?
Does the composition and phenoty pe of the tumor microenvironment, at baseline, or

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and shoul d be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a rea sonable causal relati onship between study drug administrati on and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurren ce of one or m ore AEs.)

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
resul ts in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheti cally might have caused death if it 
were m ore severe)
requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_251492] 
(seeNOTE below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incap acity
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or resul t in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcom es listed in the defini tion above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency 
room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not 
resul t in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmissio n of an infect ious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
drug i s an SAE. 
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_186770], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpo int that is considered related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE :

6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classifie d as seri ous.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The co llection of nonseri ous AE informati on should begin at ini tiation of study drug. Nonseri ous 
AE informat ion shoul d also be collected from the start of a  placebo lead-in period or other 
observat ional period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or discont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and described on th e nonseri ous 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deem ed to be treatm ent-related) shoul d be 
collected continuously during the treatm ent peri od and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_305874] dose of study  treatm ent.
Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalit ies 
that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism or 
immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg,infect ion or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which 
were exacerbated by [CONTACT_186756] y. Information supporting the assessment will 
be co llected on the subject’s case report form.
6.[ADDRESS_305875] resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laborato ry test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the defini tion of an SAE 
specified as fo llows:
Any laboratory  test result abnorm ality that requi red the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the subject to receive specific 
corrective therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
[CONTACT_251621] (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).

7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE AND OTHER EXTE RNAL 
COMMITTEES
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251495] > 13,800 patients in clinical trials while nivolumab has been 
studi ed in more than 700 patientsin clinical trials. The AE profile of nivolumab appears to be 
independent of tumor ty pe. The safet y of the combinat ion of nivo lumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251496] 53 melano ma subjects and the spectrum of adverse events observed among patients 
treated with the concurrent regimen was quali tatively similar to previous experi ence with 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285] . Adverse events observed with the combinat ion therapy 
were manageable and generally reversible with the use of existing treatm ent algorit hms. In 
addition, this is an open label study . Therefore, a data monitoring commit tee will not be utilized 
for this Phase 1/2 study .
The subjects’ safet y will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Safet y conference calls with 
investigators and representatives of the sponsor will be held approximately once a month with 
additional meet ings as necessary . The BMS medi cal monitor is a physician responsible for 
reviewing, on a systematic and continuous basis, the safet y of patients on this study . This 
includes a review of serious and non-serious adverse events, which includes all hematol ogical 
and non -hematol ogical events.
In addi tion, a BMS medical safety team  (MST) routinely reviews safety  signals across the enti re 
nivolumab program  including combinat ion studi es with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The MST is independent 
from the BMS medical monitor. The MST has the primary responsibili ty within Bristol -Myers 
Squibb for assessing emerging safet y trends, ident ifying potenti al safety signals, notifying 
appropriate stakeho lders of relevant findings, and implement ing risk management plans.
The MST is responsible for reviewing data from all sources including non-clinical studi es and 
clinical trials, monitoring the progress of various nivolumab safety support activit ies, and 
recommending and implement ing necessary  changes to the safet y plan and any other specific 
safet y-related activit ies.

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
Sample Size determination in the original protocol
This study  comprises a Dose Escal ating Safety Evaluat ion Phase for the Combinat ion Arm, 
followed by a Staged Enrollment for Arm N and Arm N -I. 
In the original protocol , gastric cancer, SCLC, TNBC, and pancreat ic cancer are included and the 
Staged Enrollment Part utilizesa modified Simon two-stage design95with the treatm ent of 40 
subjects to evaluate whether nivolumab or the combinat ion of nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251497] (ORR) that is of clinical interest . In thi s study , an ORR of 10% or l ess is 
considered not of clinical value, and anORR of 25% or greater isconsidered of strong clinical 
interest. The modified Simon design evaluates the null hypothesis that the true response rate is 
10% versus the alternat ive hypothesis that the true response rate is > 10%. The 2-stage testing 
within each cohort target sa Type I error rate of 5% and has80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis if the true response rate is 25%. 
Sample Size determination for bladder cancer cohort
In Amendment 06, the bladder cohort is added. A one stage designwith thetreatm ent of 
60 - 100 subjects is used for nivolumab monotherapy  and the dose level 2b. These sample sizes 
will provide 90% to 97% power to reject the null hypothesis of 10% response rate if the true 
response rate is 25% with a two- sided Type I error rateof 5%.
In Amendment 14, the dose level 2 arm (nivolumab 1 mg/kg +ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) of the 
bladder cancer cohort is to enroll and treat a total  of 92 subjects. A one stage design will be used. 
Based on a 19.6% ORR for nivolumab monotherapy  (CA209275), thesample size of 92 in this 
arm will provide 93% power to reject thenull hypothesis of 19.6% response rate if the true 
response rate is 35% wi th a two -sided Type I error rate of 5% .
Sample Size determination for SCLC expansion cohort
In Amendment 09, in addition to the original  two-stage design in the SCLC cohort, addit ional 
SCLC expansi on cohort subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratioto one of two expansio n 
groups: Arm A ([ADDRESS_305880] s, nivolumab mono 3 mg/kg q2w) or Arm B (100 subjects, 
nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg q3w) and will be stratified by[CONTACT_251622] (1 vs 2 prior chemotherapy  regimens).
Based on SCLC data so far observed in this study with an ORR of about 10% for nivolumab 
monotherapy and about 23% f or the nivolumab +ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976] , sample sizes
of N = 1 50 for nivolumab monothe rapy and N = 100 for nivolumab +ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251498]  (nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) will target a Type I error rate of 5% (two-
sided) and will have 78% power to detect the difference between thesetwo arms if the true 
response rate sare 10% and 23%, respectively.

power to reject the null hypothesis of 10% response rate, if the true response rate is 25% with a 
two-sided Type I error rate of 5%. 
Sample Size determination for the additional pancreatic cancer cohort
Aone stage design will be used, with the treatment of 30 subjects wi th nivo lumab 3 mg/kg every 
2 weeks, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, and cobimet inib 60 mg po qd 21 days on/7 days

Serious Adverse Event Serious adverse event defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence that at any  dose: resul ts in death; is life 
threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the tim e of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were m ore severe), requires inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_251510] o f exist ing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094]; resul ts in 
persistent or significant disabilit y/incap acity, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect; is an important medical event 
(defined as a m edical event(s) that may  not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092], based 
upon appropriate medical and scient ific judgment, may 
jeopardi ze the subject or may  requi re intervent ion

events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at h ome for allergi c bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].). For reporting purposes only, BMS also

slice thi ckness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a m easurable lesion should betwice the 
slice thi ckness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.[ADDRESS_305903] one dimensio n(longest diameter in 
the plane of t he measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_305904]/MRI scan -(CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers shoul d be recorded as non -measurable)
[ADDRESS_305905] x -ray
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologi cally enlarged andmeasurable, a lymp h 
node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and fo llowed.
1.2 Non-measurable lesions
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10mmor patho logical lymp h 
nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis) , as well as truly non -measurable lesio ns.  
Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial  effusio n, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung,

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesio ns. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns. 
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h identifiable softtissue components , that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_251632] y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic lesions
Lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiogra phically defined simple cysts shoul d not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_154020], simple cysts. 
‘Cyst ic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target l esions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumorlesions situated in a previ ously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy , are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesio n.
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_12009]
1.4.1 Measure ment of lesions
All measurements shoul d be recorded in metri c notati on(mm). All baseline evaluat ions shoul d 
be performed as close as possible to th e treatm ent start and never more than 28days beforethe 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characteri ze each 
ident ified and reported l esion at baseline and during follow-up. Im aging based evaluat ion shoul d 
always be done rather than clinical examinat ion unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  [CONTACT_461] .
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI scan
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurabilit y of lesions on CT/MRI scan isbased on the assum ption that 
CT/MRI slice thi ckness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesio n shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness.

[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X -ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progressi on is an important endpo int, 
since CT is more sensi tive than X-ray, parti cularly in identifying new lesio ns. However, lesio ns 
on chest X-ray may be consi dered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be consi dered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, docum entati on by [CONTACT_251633] a ruler to estim ate the size of the l esion is suggested . As previously  noted, 
when lesio ns can be evaluated by [CONTACT_249072], imaging evaluat ion shoul d be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are ident ified by [CONTACT_251634] , confi rmation 
by [CONTACT_462] i s advised. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, laparoscopy
The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumorevaluat ion is not advised.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all lesio ns up toa maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be re corded and m easured at baseline . 
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (lesions wi th the l ongest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum ofthediameters (longest for non -nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum , then as noted below , only the short axis is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tumorregression in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.

Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are consi dered non-patho logical and shoul d not be 
recorded or fo llowed.
2.2 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or si tes of  disease) including pathol ogical lymph nodes shoul dbe identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record mul tiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver m etastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Com plete Response (CR): Disappea rance of all target lesions. Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10mm.
Parti al Response (PR):  At  least a30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum onstudy (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addi tion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum  must al so dem onstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stabl e Disease (SD):   Nei ther sufficient shrinkage to qualif y for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
3.1.1 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_251635] r. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
15mm by [CONTACT_3610] . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis <10mm are consi dered non-patho logical and shoul d not be 
recorded or fo llowed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions th at become ‘too small to measure’  
All lesio ns (nodal and non-nodal ) recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual  measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (e.g. 2mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measure ment , that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.

if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_198228], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defaul t 
value of 5mm shoul d be assigned (note: in case ofa lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm shoul d be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This defaul t value is derived from the 5mm CT slice thickness (but 
shoul d not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate th e target lesio n sum. 
As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that woul d aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter m easurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly  coal esced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector ofthe longest diameter in this instance 
shoul d be the m aximal l ongest di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesio n’.
3.2 Evaluation of non -target lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only quali tatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alization of tumor 
marker l evel. All lymph nodes must be non -patho logical in size (< 10mm short axi s).
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):   Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special notes on assessment of non -target lesions
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res add itional explanat ion as fo llows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject also has measurable disease
To achi eve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non -target di sease, there must be an 
overall level of substant ial worsening in non-target di sease such that, even in prese nce of  SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumorburden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy . 
A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
qualit y for unequivocal progression status.

[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject has only non -measurable disease
To achi eve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non -target di sease, there must be an 
overall level  of substant ial worsening such thatthe overall tumorburden has increased 
sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy . 
A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
quali fy for unequivocal progression status. 
Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quant ified (by [CONTACT_29286]: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subject s for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that woul d be 
requi red to decl are PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumorburden represent ing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesio n). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, 
an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocol s as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject shoul d be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers
Tumormarkers alone cannot be u sed to assess objective tumorresponse s.If markers are ini tially 
above the upper norm al limit, however, they must norm alize in order for a subject to be 
considered as having attained a complete response. 
3.3 New lesions   
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progressi on. T he finding of a new 
lesion shoul d be unequivocal : i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor(for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesio ns may be simply  healing or flare of pre-exist ing lesions). This is 
particularly important when the subject ’s baseline lesi ons show parti al or com plete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cysti c lesion, 
which it i s not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study  in an anatomical location that was notscanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progressi on. An exam ple of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study  has a CT or MRI brain scan
ordered which reveals metastases. The subject ’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesio n is equivocal , for exam ple because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluat ion will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new  lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

scanning in assessment of progressi on (particularly possible ‘new ’ disease). New lesio ns on the 
basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the fo llowing al gorithm: 
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, wi th a posi tive FDG -PET at follow -up might be a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. However, other reasons for newl y detected lesio ns with increased 
FDG -PET uptake, such as inflammatory  lymphnodes, should be taken into considerat ion.
No FDG -PET at baseline and a posit ive FDG -PET at fo llow-up: 
If the posi tive FDG -PET at follow-up corresponds to a n ew site of disease confirmed by 
[CONTACT_4654], thi s is PD. 
If the positive FDG -PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progressi on 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the init ial positiveFDG -
PET scan).
If the posi tive FDG -PET at f ollow -up corresponds to a pre -exist ing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis o f the anatomic images, this is not PD.

(minimum 4weeks a fter cri teria for an obj ective response are first met).
Verification of Progression: Progression of disease shoul d be verified in cases where 
progression is equivocal. If repeat scans confi rm PD, then progressi on shoul d be declared 
using the date of the initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is 
considered not to have progressive disease per RECIST 1.1.

first treatm ent and the date of  objectively docum ented progressi on per RECIST1.[ADDRESS_305910]’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and 
non-target di sease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.
Com plete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a

criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duratio n for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely  still present and in fact the subject had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.

Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as [ADDRESS_305914] imulat ing horm one, (FSH) level > 
40 m IU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout peri od is a functi on of  the type of  HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators shoul d use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral  products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mLat any time during the washout period, the wom an can be consi dered 
postm enopausal.

•Clarification on need for subject safety follow up before dose escalation
and staggered enrollment for Dose Cohort Level 2.
•Clarification on number of subjects with objective response and number
of enrolle d subjects before proceeding from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
Eligibility Criteria
•Clarified wording that subjects with Breast Cancer, Gastric or Gastro -
Esophageal Junction Carcinoma, or SCLC must have progressive or
refracto ry disease at study entry.
•Adjusted eligibility, treatment delay and discontinuation criteria for
subjects with lipase or amylase > 1.[ADDRESS_305918]: Subjects with asymptomatic
elevations in amylase or lipase not associated with symptoms, clinical
manifestations, or radiographic sings of pancreatiti s are eligible. Based
on clinical experience in ongoing studies with nivolumab and
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], asymptomatic elevations of amylase or lipase have not been
proven to have to have independent clinical consequence or predict for
development or severity of panc reatitis. A wide variation of
asymptomatic elevations in amylase or lipase can occur on a day -
to-day
basis, limiting the utility of interpreting the amylase or lipase elevations
in isolatio n.
•Clarifications on eligibility for women of childbearing potent ial and
effective methods of contraception.
•Clarification on eligibility of subjects with prior malignancy not
interfering with the primary and secondary study endpoints.

BMS -936558 / BMS -734016 nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251534], an initial dose-escalating safety evaluation for the combinatio n arms was conducted with GC, 
PC, TNBC, or SCLC (described in protocol Section 3.1.3) . The BC cohort was added to this protocol following the 
completion of the safety  evaluations in GC, PC, TNBC, and SCLC at dose level 1 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
1mg/kg) which did not reveal safety concerns. Thereby [CONTACT_251636] 2
(nivolumab 1 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg). Six BC patients were initially  randomized to Dose Level 2, after which 
enrollment to Dose Level 2b (nivolumab 3 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg) began.
Enrollment to Stage 1 for Arm N occurred in parallel to the safety evaluation for Arm N -I.
Two Stage Design: GC, PC, TNBC, or SCLC Arms N and N-I will follow a two-stage design to test whether 
nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251535] s an objective response rate (ORR) that is of 
clinical interest in the investigated tumor types. For each tumor type, only treatment arms which meet an ORR 
threshold will proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (described in protocol Section 3.1.4). Enrollment to Stage 2 in a 
given treatment arm can continue even if the other treatment arm is still in Stage 1.
Table 1: Efficacy criteria to proceed from Stage [ADDRESS_305920] confirmed PR or CR. No Go into Stage 2
For Stage 2, upon completion of enrollment of the initial 40 subjects, additio nal subjects may  be assigned into Arm 
N and Arm N -I up to a total of 100 subje cts (including those assigned in Stage 1) in each treatment arm of the given 
tumor type. For tumor types where nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg 
proceeded to Stage 2, assessment of Dose Level 2b in Stage 2 (nivolumab 3 mg/k g + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, n=up to 
70subjects) may be initiated for that tumor ty pe.For SCLC, an additio nal 250 subjects (second -or third-line) will 
be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of the 2 expansion groups: nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or nivolumab
1mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg.
Modified Design for Bladder Cancer Cohort:
Bladder arms N and N-I (Dose Levels 2 and 2b) will be conducted as a One Stage Design with the treatment of 
26-105 subjects in each arm. The Safety Evaluation Phase for the N-I arm will start at Dose Level 2 (nivolumab
1mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) and will evaluate safety and tolerability after the first 6 randomized subjects.
Following the N-I safety evaluation phase, Dose Leve l 2 will enroll 26 subjects and 2b will enroll up to a total of
105subjects. Based on the safety evaluations thus far on study, no dose escalatio n phase is necessary for bladder
cohort N -I Dose Level 2b (nivolumab 3 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg).
Modified De sign for Ovarian Cancer Cohort:
Ovarian arm N-I (Dose Levels 2, 2b and 2c) will be conducted as a One Stage Design with the treatment of 
40subjects in each arm. Due to the low risk of development of new safety signals on the combination arms no safet y 
evaluation phase will be employed. Ovarian cancer subjects will be followed for related toxicities and decisions to 
stop treatment will be made on an ongoing basis .
SCLC expansion:
SCLC cohorts Arm N and Arm N-I met the pre-specified safety and efficacy criteria and proceeded to Stage 2. 
Based on an interim data review, disease control rates (SD + PR + CR) of 36% and 57% for Arms N and N-I, 
respectively, were estimated. In order to further investigate nivolumab and nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251536], the SCLC expansion cohorts will enroll additional subjects based on 
response to prior treatment and the number of previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Up to [ADDRESS_305921] line subjects will be 
randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of 2 expa nsion groups: Arm A (150 subjects treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg ever y 
2weeks (Q2W)) or Arm B (100 subjects treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3weeks 
(Q3W) for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg (Q2W) and will be stratified for number of prio r treatment lines 
(1 vs 2 prior chemotherapy regimens). The crossover option refers only to the original cohorts and not the new 
cohorts enrolled under or after Amendment 09 implementation.

Study Assessments:
Tumor assessments
The primary endpoint of this study, ORR, is based on tumor assessments at baseline and then at 6weeks from first 
dose. Tumor assessments continue every 6weeks for the first 24weeks and every 12weeks thereafter while on 
treatment or on treatment hold for any reason until disease progression (investigator -assessed RECIST 1.1-defined 
progression) or treatment discontinuation, except for subjects treated beyond progression or whodiscontinued 
treatment for other reasons than PD.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size Determination
Sample size determination in the original protocol
This study comprises a Dose Escalating Safety Evaluation Phase for the Combination Arm, followed by a Staged 
Enrollment for Arm N, and Arm N -I. 
In the original protocol , gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer 
are included and the Staged Enrollment Part utilizes a modified Simon two-stage design with the treatment of 
40subjects to evaluate whether nivolumab, or the combination of nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251311] (ORR) that is of clinical interest. In this study,  an ORR of 10% or less is considered not of clinical 
value, and an ORR of 25% or greater is considered of strong clinical interest. The modified Simo n design evaluates 
the nul l hypothesis that the true response rate is 10% versus the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is 
> 10%. The 2 -stage testing within each cohort targets a Type I error rate of 5% and has 80% power to reject the null
hypothesis if the true r esponse rate is 25%.
Sample size determination for bladder cancer cohort
In Amen dment 06, the bladder cohort isadded. A one stage design with the treatment of 60-100 subjects is used. 
These sample sizes provide 90% to 97% power to reject the null hypothes is of 10% response rate if the true response 
rate is 25% with a two -sided Ty pe I erro r rate of 5%.
Sample size determination for SCLC expansion cohort
In Amendment 09, in addition to the original two -stage design of SCLC subjects, additional SCLC expansion cohort 
subjects willbe randomized in a 3:2 ratio to one of 2 expansion groups: Arm A (150 subjects, nivolumab mono) or 
Arm B (100 subjects, nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) and willbe stratified for number of prior treatment 
lines (1 vs 2 prior c hemotherapy regimens). 
Based on SCLC data so far observed in this study with an ORR of about 10% for nivolumab monotherapy and about 
23% for nivolumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976], sample sizes of N = 150 for nivolumab monotherapy and 
N =100 for nivo lumab / ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976]  (nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) will target a 
Type I error rate of 5% (two -sided) and will have 78% power to detect the difference between these two arms, if the 
true ORR rates are 10% and 23%, respectively.
Sample size determination for ovarian cancer cohort
Also in Amendment 09, an ovarian cancer cohort is added and a one stage design with the treatment of 4 0 subjects 
for each arm is used. These sample sizes willprovide 79% power to reject the null hy pothes is of 10% response rate 
if the true response rate is 25% with a two -sided Ty pe I error rate of 5%.

with two-sided 95% CI using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method will also be calculated by [CONTACT_9084]. In additio n, 
the percentage of responders still in response at different time points (3,6,and12months ) will be presented based 
on the KM plot.
The magnitude of reductio n in tumor burden will be summarized descriptively. Immune related responses will be 
summarized descriptively.
Secondary Endpoint s:
Safety will be assessed in all treated subjects. The rate of treatment -related adverse events leading to drug 
discontinuation within the first [ADDRESS_305926] known alive date.
Analysis:
Treatment -related AE s leading to discontinuation will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_305927] grade NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria.
PFS and OS will be summarized descriptively using Kaplan -Meier methodology. Median values of PFS and OS, 
along with two -sided 95% CIs using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method, will be calculated for each cohort. PFS 
rates at 6 and 12 months, and OS rates at 12 and 24months will also be estimated. Associated two-sided 95% CIs 
will be calculated using the Greenwood formula. Additional survival analy sis may be conducted for up to 5years

Intense toxicity monitoring will help to ensure the subjects’ safety in Study  CA209032, 
including frequent safet y conference calls with investigators and representatives of the 
sponsor
A BMS medical safety team  (MST) routinely reviews safet y signals across the entire 
nivolumab program, including all ongo ing co mbinations wit h ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]
Two stage design used which will stop an individual arm for lack of sufficient activit y
For the combinat ion arm , an ini tial dose escalat ing safet y evaluation phase will be perform ed 
to determine the optimal dose for each tumor ty pe independent ly
In conclusio n, the overall risk-benefit assessment for Study  CA209032 does justify the conduct

currently used in the Phase 3 melano ma study , nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg, 
was expected to also be tolerable in the tumors studi ed here, an init ial dose-escalat ing safet y 
evaluat ion forthe combinat ion arms was conducted wi th GC, PC, TNBC, or SCLC (described in 
protocol  Section3.1.2 ). The BC cohort was added to this protocol  following the completion of 
the safet y evaluat ions in GC, PC, TNBC, and SCLC at dose level 1 (nivo lumab 1mg/kg, 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg) which did not reveal safet y concerns. Thereby [CONTACT_251598] 2 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg, i pi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg). Six BC patients were 
initially rando mized to Dose Level 2, after which enrollment to Dose Level 2b (nivo lumab 
3mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg) began.
Enrollment to Stage 1 for Arm N occur redin parallel to the safet y evaluat ion for Arm N -I.
Two Stage Design: GC, PC, TNBC, SCLC Arms will follow a two -stage desi gn to tes t whether 
nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251416] (ORR) that is of clinical interest in the investigated tumor ty pes. For each tumor ty pe, only 
treatm ent arms which meet an O RR threshol d will proceed from  Stage 1 to Stage 2 (described in 
protocol  Section3.1.3 ). Enrollment to Stage 2 in a given treatm ent arm can continue even if the 
other tre atment arm is still in Stage 1.
For Stage 2, upon complet ion of enrollment for the init ial 40 subjects, additional subjects maybe 
assigned into Arm N and Arm N-I up to a total of 100 subjects (including those assigned in 
Stage 1) in each treatm ent arm of the given tumor type. For tumor types where nivolumab 
monotherapy  or ni volumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg proceeded to Stage 2, assessment 
of Dose Level 2b in Stage 2 (nivo lumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg, n=up to 70subjects) 
may be init iated for that tum or ty pe.For SCLC, an additional 250 subjects (second -or thi rd-line) 
will be rando mized in a 3:2 ratio to one of the 2 expansio n groups: nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 
2weeks or nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by 
[CONTACT_20382] 3 m g/kg.
3.1.1 Modifie d Designs
Bladder Cancer Cohort
The enrollment for the BC cohorts N and N-I (Dose Level 2b) will be conducted as a One Stage 
Design:
Recent ly, inhibit ion of PD-L1 by [CONTACT_34460]3280A was shown to have clinical activity in 
patients with metastati c urothelial bladder cancer , leading toapproval of the drug in this 
indicat ion by [CONTACT_1622] .59In particular, in patients with tumors tested positive for PD-L1 
expressio n, the overall response rate was 43%. The overall response r ate regardl ess of  PD-L1

As these data show that checkpo int inhibit ion has potenti al to be an active treatm ent for 
patients with advanced bladder cancer, a Two Stage design with the intent of avoiding to 
expose too many patients to a potentially ineffect ive treatm ent does not appear to be 
necessary  for this specific tum or type.
Bladder arms N and N-I (Dose Levels 2 and 2b) will be conducted as a One Stage Design 
with the treatm ent of 26-105 subjects in each arm. The Safet y Evaluat ion Phas e for the N-I 
arm will start at Dose Level 2 (nivo lumab 1mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3mg/kg) and will evaluate 
safet y and tolerabili ty after the first 6 randomized subjects. Following the N-I safet y 
evaluat ion phase, Dose Levels 2 will enroll 26 subjects and 2b will enroll  up to a total of 
105subjects. Based on the safet y evaluat ions thus far on study , no dose escalat ion phase is 
necessary  for bladder cohort N -I Dose Level 2b (nivo lumab 3 mg/kg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1mg/kg). 
Ovarian Cancer Cohort
The OC cohorts N-I (Dose Level 2, 2b, 2c) will be conducted as a One Stage Design with the 
enrollment of 40 subjects in each arm. The Dose Level 2c was added to Ov arian Cancer Cohort 
based on the resul ts of CA209003 and CA209012 clinical studi es menti oned above. The efficacy 
and tolerabili ty of nivolumab monotherapy  observed in CA209003 study with longer follow-up 
of previously treated NSCLC patients suggested a strategy  in which nivolumab serves as the 
“base” of a combinat ion regimen, with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251417]/or less 
frequent administration. This strategy  is the basis for new nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251544] 3 mg/kg Q2W combined wi th ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg Q6W . 
This regimen was used in CA209012 study  with preliminary data showing a promising activi ty 
and a good safet y profile of the combinat ion.
The enrollment to the N-I arm to DoseLevels 2, 2b, and 2c will be conducted simultaneously. 
Due to the l ow ri sk of  devel opment of  new safet y signals on the combinati on arms confirmed by

and glio blastoma as well as the clinical study  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 10 mg/kg m onotherapy in ovari an

In the event of [ADDRESS_305942] 9 subjects requi ring perm anent discontinuati on, a discussi on wi th 
investigators may be held to review the risk/benefit of this regimen. The rationale for this 
evaluat ion is that the most frequent severe drug related AEs for the combinat ion in melano ma 
have been asymptom atic, reversible laboratory events (ie,LFTs and lipase) and there is 
preliminary evidence of deep and durable responses in the N-I arm in advanced melano ma 
(CA209004). Therefore, a discussio n of the risk/benefit of the regimen will be triggered if the 
following criteria are met:
A majorit y of subjects who discont inue due to treatm ent related AEs have deep tumor 
response (ie ,> 80% reduction)
All treatm ent related AEs leading to discontinuation are non-fatal, reversibl e and without

[IP_ADDRESS] Stage 1
This Stage is intended to assess the efficacy in 18 subjects per treatm ent arm per tumor type to 
determine whether enrollment shoul d continue to Stage 2. For efficacy  determinati on, each Arm 
within each tum or type will  be assessed independent ly.
Arm N: The enrollment and treatm ent of 18 subjects to Arm N per tumor ty pe can begin while 
the initial Dose Cohort for Arm N-I in this tumor ty pe is still ongoing. The dose level in ArmN 
is3mg/kg nivolumab IV every two weeks (Q2W). This dose has been established in more than 
700subjects with various tumor types exposed to nivolumab monotherapy  with a tolerable 
AEprofile. Therefore no dose adjust ments for Arm N are planned.
Arm N- I:Up to [ADDRESS_305943] igation from the 
Dose Escal ating Safet y Evaluat ion phase will be counted as part of the 18 required subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria to proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2
The decisio n to proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2 will be made for each tumor and for each 
treatm ent arm  independ ently and include ( Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1):
[ADDRESS_305944] igators to ensure that it is acceptable for continued 
enrollment.
Subjects with initial PD per RECIST 1.1who continue treatm ent in their initially 
assigned treatm ent arm beyond progressi on (Secti on4.5.7 )and subsequently reach 
confirmed immune related CR or PR (rel ative to initial tumor assessment) and including 
any new measurable lesions within the sum of all target lesions, will be considered as 
having an object ive response for the purposes of meeting criteria for moving from 
Stage [ADDRESS_305945] 1.1, these immune related response 
criteria using unidimensio nal measurements account for theunusual immune related 
tumor response patterns reported for both ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251547].
Once the last subject in a given treatment arm has permanent ly discont inued treatm ent for 
any reason or has reached the Week 48 Tum or Assessment, and the above criteria are not 
met, then this treatment arm will not proceed to Stage 2. Ongoing subjects will cont inue to be

tumor ty pes where nivolumab monotherapy  proceeded to Stage 2, assessment of Dose Level 2b 
in Stage 2 (nivo lumab 3 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg, n=40 subjects) will be init iated for that 
tumor type. A separate evaluat ion of Dose Level 2b may be necessary if the safety  and

3.1.4 SCLC Expansion
SCLC cohorts Arm N and Arm N-I met the pre-specified safet y and efficacy criteria and 
proceeded to Stage 2. Based on an interim data review, disease control  rates (SD + PR + CR) of 
36% and 57% for Arms N and N-I, respectively, were estimated. In order to further invest igate 
nivolumab and nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251428], 
the SCLC expansi on cohorts will enroll additional subjects based on response to prior treatm ent 
and the number of previ ous therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. Up to 250second or third line subjects will be randomized
in a 3:2ratioto one of 2 expansio n groups: Arm A (150 subjects treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
every 2weeks (Q2W) )or Arm B (100 subjects treated withnivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 
3mg/kg every 3weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles followed by [CONTACT_20382] 3 mg/kg (Q2W )and will be 
stratified for number of prior treatment lines (1 vs 2 prior chemotherapy regimens).
The study  popul ation for the SCLC expansio n cohort i s specified as fo llows:
Histopathol ogically or cy tologically confirmed di agno sis of SCLC.
All subjects had platinum -based first-line treatment. Subjects with previous second -line 
chemotherapy treatment are eligible as well.
Subjects with plat inum refractory , resi stant, or sensit ive disease are eligible.
Subjects with init ial diagno sis of limit ed or extensive disease are eligible.
Docum ented obj ective radiographic disease progressio n at study  entry .
Tumor assessments for subjects in the SCLC expansi on cohort willundergo a BICRassessment.
The crossover option refers only  to the ori ginal  cohorts and not the new cohorts enrolled under or 
after Am endment 09.

2.Medical History and Concurrent Diseases
a)Any seri ous or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_186693], m ay 
increase the risk associ ated with study  participati on or study drug administration, impair 
the abilit y of the subject to receive protocol  therapy , or interfere wi th the interpretati on of 
study  resul ts.
b)Other prior malignancy active within the previ ous 3 years except for local or organ 
confined early stage cancer that has been defini tively treated with curative intent, does 
not requi re ongoing treatm ent, has no evidence of residual active disease, and has a 
negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to interfere with the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints of the study , including response rate and safet y.
c)Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, 
type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothy roidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only

Addit ional protocol specified r easons for discont inuation (see Section 4.5.5 ).
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of  this event. In most cases, the study  drug will be permanent ly discont inued in 
an appropri ate manner. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuat ion of study  drug, a di scussio n between the invest igator and the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee m ust occur.
All subjects who discont inue invest igational product shoul d comply with protocol  specified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Secti on 5. The only excepti on to thi s requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treatm ent study  follow-up or 
loses the abilit y to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study  treatm ent is discont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be documented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
For subjects achieving confirmed CR or a PRfor more than 3 month (long lasting PR) the 
investigator may decide to hold treatm ent for this subject after discussio n with the medical 
monitor of  the sponsor. Subjects for which treatment was held following long lasting responses 
and who experi ence a recurrenc e of disease progressi on may reini tiate thei r last study treatm ent.

Any adverse event, laboratory  abnorm ality, or concurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the invest igator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicat ion.
Because of the potent ial for nivolumab -or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -related AEs requi ring early recogni tion 
and prom pt intervention, management algorithms have been devel oped for suspected pulmo nary 
toxicity, GI toxicity, hepatotoxicit y, endocrinopathy , skin toxicity, neurological toxici ty,and 
nephrotoxi city.
In order to standardi ze the management of adverse events for all subjects, treatm ent management 
algorithms recommended for utilizat ion in Study  CA209032 are included in Appendix 2. 
Adverse event treatm ent management algorithms included in the Nivo lumab IB or 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251460].
4.5.3 Dose Modifications
Intrapatient dose reducti ons for the management of toxicities ofindividual subjects or dose 
escalat ions are not permitted.
4.5.4 Criteria to Resume Treatment
Subjects may resume treatm ent with study  drug when the drug-related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade1 or baseline value, with the fo llowing excepti ons:
Subjects m ay resume treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 fat igue.
Subjects with baseline Grade [ADDRESS_305994]/ALT or total bilirubin who requi re dose delays for 
reasons other than a [ADDRESS_305995]/ALT or total  bilirubin may resume treatm ent in the 
presence of Grade [ADDRESS_305996]/ALT OR total bilirubin. Subjects with combined 
Grade 2AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meet ing discontinuat ion parameters 
(Secti on4.5.5 ) should have treatment permanent ly discont inued.

CT scans shoul d be acquired with 5mm slices with no intervening gap (cont iguous). Although a

MRI m ay be used based on local standards.
Shoul d a subject have a contraindicat ion for CT IV contrast, a non -contrast CT of the chest and a

Every  attempt shoul d be made to image each subject using an ident ical acquisit ion protocol  on

Note: Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner:
Combined modality scanning such as with FDG-PET/CT is increasingly used in clinical care, 
and is a modality/techno logy that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the recommendat ions outlined 
here may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation correcti on CT 
porti ons of a combined FDG -PET/CT are of limited use in anatomically based efficacy 
assessments and it is therefore suggested that they shoul d not be substi tuted for dedicated 
diagnosti c contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST measurements. However, 
if a site can docum ent that the CT perform ed as part of  a FDG -PET/CT i s of identical diagnostic 
qualit y to a diagno stic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT porti on of the FDG -PET/CT 
can be used for RECIST 1.1m easurements. Note, however, that the FDG -PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially
perform ed.
MRI Brain
MRI or CT of brain is required at screening in order to rule out active metastatic disease. For 
patients with a history  of known brain metastasis, an MRI brain is requi red at baseline. A CT 
brain is not all owed for patients wi th known brain metastasis at baseline. Subjects wi th a history

[CONTACT_251615]. ORR is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) 
of complete response (CR) or parti al response (PR) divided by [CONTACT_251616].

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappear ed after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duratio n for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not 
CR at the first time point . Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best

5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
General health status will be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardized 
instrum ent for use as a measure of self-reported general healt h status. The EQ-5D comprises of 
5dimensio ns (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y) and a visual 
analog rating scale (VAS). The utility data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and 
commo nly used in cost effect iveness analysis.
The EQ -5D m easure will be collected as follows:
Nivo lumab monotherapy  arm: Collect prior to each study  drug administration at Week 1, 3, 
5, 7, 9, 11, and 13, then at the same time of subsequent tumor assessments, during 
FollowUp1 and 2 and survival visits .
Nivo lumab / Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251572]: Collect pri or to each study  drug administrati on at 
Week 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13, then at the same time of subsequent tumor assessments, during 
FollowUp1 and 2 and survival visits .
The EQ-5D can be done via a phone contact [CONTACT_152561] a clinic visit is not feasible (ie, follow up

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and shoul d be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relati onship between study drug administrati on and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion,or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any d ose: 
resul ts in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheti cally might have caused death if it 
were m ore severe)
requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_251492] 
(seeNOTE below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be imme diately 
life-threatening or resul t in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcom es listed in the defini tion above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency 
room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not 
resul t in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmissio n of an infect ious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathog enic) via the study 
drug i s an SAE. 
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_186770], these events must be handled as SAEs. 
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpo int that is considered related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The fo llowing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53913]: 
a visi t to the em ergency room  or other hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53914] < 24 ho urs, that does not resul t in 
admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne health assessment requi ring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to rem edy ill healt h and pl anned pri or to entry  into the

6.1.[ADDRESS_306037]’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and wit hin [ADDRESS_306038] be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified procedure 
(eg,afollow-up skin biopsy).
The investigator shoul d report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be rel ated to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure.
An SAE report should be co mpleted for any  event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal  of previous therapy  or a c omplicat ion of a study 
procedure), the relat ionship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) wit hin [ADDRESS_306039] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on 
a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper f orms). When using paper forms, the reports 
are to be transmitted via email  or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: See Contact [CONTACT_198264].
SAE Facsimile Number: See Contact [CONTACT_198264].
For studi es capturing SAEs through electroni c data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the 
requi redmethod for reporting. The paper forms shoul d be used and submi tted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system  is unavailable for transmissio n. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (requ ired for SAE and pregnancy reporting): See Contact [CONTACT_251620].
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports should include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.)
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, a follow-up SAE report shoul d be sent wi thin 24 hours to BMS (or desi gnee) 
using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs shoul d be f ollowed to resol ution or stabilizat ion.

beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or discont inuat ion of study drug and for thosepresent at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and described on th e nonseri ous 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deem ed to be treatm ent-related) should be 
collected continuously during the treatm ent peri od and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_306040] dose of study  treatm ent.
Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalit ies 
that are reported/ident ified duri ng the course of the study .
Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism or 
immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies(eg,infect ion or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etiology which 
were exacerbated by [CONTACT_186756] y. Information supporting the assessment will 
be co llected on the subject’s case report form.
6.[ADDRESS_306041] resul t abnormalit ies shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the defini tion of an SAE 
specified as fo llows:
Any laboratory  test result abnorm ality that requi red the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the subject to receive specific 
corrective therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by

7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE AND OTHER EXTE RNAL 
COMMIT TEES
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251495] > 13,800 patients in clinical trials while nivolumab has been 
studi ed in more than 700 patients in clinical trials. The AE profile of nivolumab appears to be 
independent of tumor ty pe. The safet y of the combinat ion of ni volumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251496] 53 melano ma subjects and the spectrum of adverse events observed among patients 
treated with the concurrent regimen was quali tatively similar to previous experi ence with 
nivolumab or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285] . Adverse events observed with the combinat ion therapy 
were manageable and generally reversible with the use of existing treatm ent algorithms. In 
addition, this is an open label study . Therefore, a data monitoring commit tee will not be utilized 
for this Phase 1/2 study .
The subjects’ safet y will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Safet y conference calls with 
investigators and representatives of the sponsor will be held approximately once a month with 
additional meet ings as necessary . The BMS medi cal monitor is a physician responsible for 
reviewing, on a systematic and continuous basis, the safet y of patients on this study . This 
includes a review of serious and non-serious adverse events, which includes all hematol ogical 
and non -hematol ogical events.
In addi tion, a B MS medical safety team  (MST) routinely reviews safety  signals across the enti re 
nivolumab program  including combinat ion studi es with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The MST is independent 
from the BMS medical monitor. The MST has the primary responsibili ty within Bristol -Myer s 
Squibb for assessing emerging safet y trends, ident ifying potenti al safety signals, notifying 
appropriate stakeholders of relevant findings, and implement ing risk management plans.
The MST is responsible for reviewing data from all sources including non-c linical studi es and 
clinical trials, monitoring the progress of various nivolumab safety support activit ies, and 
recommending and implement ing necessary  changes to the safet y plan and any other specific 
safet y-related activit ies.

followed by a Staged Enrollment for Arm N and Arm N -I. 
In the original  protocol , gastric cancer, SCL C, TNBC, and pancreat ic cancer areincluded and the 
Staged Enrollment Part utilizes a modified Simon two-stage design79with the treatm ent of 40 
subjects to evaluate whether nivolumab or the combinat ion of nivolumab/ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251576] (ORR) that is of clinical interest . In thi s study , an ORR of 10% or l ess is 
considered not of clinical value, and an ORR of 25% or greater isconsidered of strong clinical 
interest. The modified Simon design evaluates the null hypothesis that the true response rate is 
10% versus the alternat ive hypothesis that the true response rate is > 10%. The 2-stage testing 
within each cohort target sa Type I error rate of 5% and has80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis if the true response rate is 25%. 
Sample Size determination for bladder cancer cohort
In Amendment 06, the bladder cancer cohort is added. A one stage design with the treatm ent of 
60-100 subjects is used. These sample sizes provi de 90% to 97% power to reject the null 
hypothesis ofa10% response rate if the true response rate is 25% with a two-sided Type I error 
rate of 5%. 
Sample Size determination for SCLC expansion cohort :
In Amendment 09, in addition to the original  two-stage design in the SCLC cohort, addit ional 
SCLC expansi on c ohort subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratioto one of two expansio n 
groups: Arm  A ([ADDRESS_306046], nivol umab m ono3 mg/kg q2w ) or Arm B (100 subjects, nivol umab 
1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg q3w) and willbe stratified by[CONTACT_251643] ( 1 
vs 2 pri or chem otherapy  regimens).
Based on SCLC data so far observed in this study with an ORR of about 10% for nivolumab 
monotherapy and about 23% f or the nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103976] , sample sizes
of N = 1 50 for nivolumab monotherapy  andN = 100 for nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251498]  (nivo lumab 1 mg/kg + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg) will target a Type I error rate of 5% 
(two-sided) and will have 78% power to detect the difference between the setwo arm sif the true 
response rate sare 10% an d 23%, respectively . 
Sample Size determination for ovarian cancer cohort
Also in Amendment 09, an ovari an cancer cohort isadded and one stage design with the 
treatm ent of  40 subjects for each combinati on arm will be used. These sample sizes will provi de 
79% power to reject the null hypothesis of 10% response rate, if the true response rate is 25% 
with a two -sided Type I error rate of 5%.

Similar methods will be used to summarize ORR for each stratificat ion factor (no p -value will be 
provi ded).
ORR will be further characteri zed by [CONTACT_251625] (DOR) and the magnitude of 
reducti on in tumor volume. DOR will be computed for subjects with a BOR of PR or CR and is 
defined as the time from first confi rmed response (CR or PR) to the date of  the first docum ented 
tumor progressi on as determined using RECIST [ADDRESS_306050] documented tumor progressio n or death.
These measures of response will be interpreted in the context of histori cal responses observed 
following treatm ent wi th approved agents.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The secondary  objective (to assess the safet y and tolerabilit y of nivolumab monotherapy  or 
nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251300]) will be 
primarily assessed by [CONTACT_251644] -related AEs leading to drug discont inuat ions during 
the first 12 weeks of treatm ent. In addition, safety and tolerabili ty will be analyzed through the 
incidence of adverse events, serious adverse even ts, and specific laboratory abnormalit ies 
(worst grade) in each cohort. Toxi cities will be graded using the Nati onal Cancer Inst itute (NCI) 
Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.
PFS is defined as the time from treatment assignment in IVRS to the date of the first documented 
tumor progression, as determined by [CONTACT_251626] (per
RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a 
reported prior progressi on will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. 
Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor 
assessment. Subjects who did not have any on-study  tumor assessments and did not die will be
censored on the date they  were assigned treatm ent in the IVRS. Subjects who started anti -cancer 
therapy  either pri or to death or without a pri or reported progressi on will be censored on the date 
of their last eval uable tum or assessment prior to the init iation of  subsequent anti -cancer therapy .
OS is defined as the time between the date of treatment assignment in IVRS and the date of death 
due to any cause. A subject who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date. 
OSwill be followed continu ously  while subjects are on the study  drug and every [ADDRESS_306051] after subjects discont inue the study  drug.

Serious Adverse EventSerious adverse event defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that at any  dose: results in death; is life threatening (defi ned as an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe), requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_251579]; results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_251580], based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the 
definition above). Examples of such events include, but are not 
limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].). For reporting purposes only, BMS also 
considers the occurrence of pregnancy, overdos e (regardless of 
association with an AE), and cancer as important medical events.

slice thi ckness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.[ADDRESS_306070] one dimensio n(longest diameter in 
the plane of t he measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_306071]/MRI scan -(CT/MRI scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers shoul d be recorded as non -measurable)
[ADDRESS_306072] x -ray
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologi cally enlarged andmeasurable, a lymp h 
node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis 
will be measured and fo llowed.
1.2 Non-measurable lesions
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10mmor patho logical lymp h 
nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis) , as well as truly non -measurable lesio ns.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesio ns. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns. 
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h identifiable softtissue components , that 
can be evaluated by [CONTACT_251632] y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic lesions
Lesio ns that meet the criteria for radiogra phically defined simple cysts shoul d not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_154020], simple cysts. 
‘Cyst ic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definit ion of measurabilit y described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target l esions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumorlesions situated in a previ ously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy , are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesio n.
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_12009]
1.4.1 Measure ment of lesions
All measurements shoul d be recorded in metri c notati on(mm). All baseline evaluat ions shoul d 
be performed as close as possible to th e treatm ent start and never more than 28days beforethe 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characteri ze each 
ident ified and reported l esion at baseline and during follow-up. Im aging based evaluat ion shoul d 
always be done rather than clinical examinat ion unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  [CONTACT_461] .
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI scan
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurabilit y of lesions on CT/MRI scan isbased on the assum ption that 
CT/MRI slice thi ckness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesio n shoul d be twi ce the slice thickness.

[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X -ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progressi on is an important endpo int, 
since CT is more sensi tive than X-ray, parti cularly in identifying new lesio ns. However, lesio ns 
on chest X-ray may be consi dered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be consi dered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, docum entati on by [CONTACT_251633] a ruler to estim ate the size of the l esion is suggested . As previously  noted, 
when lesio ns can be evaluated by [CONTACT_249072], imaging evaluat ion shoul d be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are ident ified by [CONTACT_251634] , confi rmation 
by [CONTACT_462] i s advised. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, laparoscopy
The utilizat ion of these techniques for object ive tumorevaluat ion is not advised.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers 
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all lesio ns up toa maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be re corded and m easured at baseline . 
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (lesions wi th the l ongest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum ofthediameters (longest for non -nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum , then as noted below , only the short axis is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urther characteri ze any objective tumorregression in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.

15mm by [CONTACT_3610] . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are consi dered non-patho logical and shoul d not be 
recorded or fo llowed.
2.2 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or si tes of  disease) including pathol ogical lymph nodes shoul dbe identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record mul tiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg,‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver m etastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any patho logical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10mm.
Parti al Response (PR):  At  least a30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference th e baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum onstudy (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addi tion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum  must al so dem onstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stabl e Disease (SD):   Nei ther sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
3.1.1 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by[CONTACT_251635] r. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
15mm by [CONTACT_3610] . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are consi dered non-patho logical and shoul d not be 
recorded or fo llowed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions th at become ‘too small to measure’  
All lesio ns (nodal and non-nodal ) recorded at baseline shoul dhave their actual  measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measure ment , that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.

if it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_198228], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a defaul t 
value of 5mm shoul d be assigned (note: in case ofa lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm shoul d be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This defaul t value is derived from the 5mm CT slice thickness (but 
shoul d not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate th e target lesio n sum. 
As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that woul d aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter m easurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly  coal esced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector ofthe longest diameter in this instance 
shoul d be the m aximal l ongest di ameter for the ‘coalesced lesio n’.
3.2 Evaluation of non -target lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only quali tatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alizati on of tumor 
marker l evel. All lymph nodes must be non -patho logical in size (< 10mm short axi s).
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
Progressive Diseas e (PD):   Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special notes on assessment of non -target lesions
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res additional explanati on as fo llows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject also has measurable disease
To achi eve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non -target di sease, there must be an 
overall level of substant ial worsening in non-target di sease such that, even in pre sence of  SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumorburden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy . 
A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
qualit y for unequivocal progressio n status.

[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject has only non -measurable disease
To achi eve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non -target di sease, there must be an 
overall level  of substant ial worsening such thatthe overall tumorburden has increased 
sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion of therapy . 
A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
quali fy for unequivocal progression status. 
Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quant ified (by [CONTACT_29286]: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subject s for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to th e increase that woul d be 
requi red to declare PD for measurable disease: ie,an increase in tumorburden represent ing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measur able lesio n). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, 
an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocol s as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.
If ‘unequivocal pro gression’ is seen, the subject shoul d be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers
Tumormarkers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumorresponse s.If markers are ini tially 
above the upper norm al limit, however, they must norm alize in order for a subject to be 
considered as having attained a complete response. 
3.3 New lesions   
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progressi on. T he finding of a new 
lesion shoul d be unequivocal: ie,not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor(for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesio ns may be simply  healing or flare of pre-exist ing lesions). This is 
particularly important when the subject ’s baseline lesions show parti al or com plete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesion, 
which it i s not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study  in an anatomical location that was notscanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progressi on. An exam ple of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study  has a CT or MRI brain scan
ordered which reveals metastases. The subject ’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesio n is equivocal , for exam ple because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluat ion will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new  lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

scanning in assessment of progressi on (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesio ns on the 
basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the fo llowing al gorithm: 
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, wi th a posi tive FDG -PET at follow -up might be a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. However, other reasons for newly detected lesio ns with increased 
FDG -PET uptake, such as inflammatory  lymphnodes, should be taken into considerat ion.
No FDG -PET at baseline and a posit ive FDG -PET at fo llow-up: 
If the posi tive FDG -PET at follow-up corresponds to a n ew site of disease confi rmed by 
[CONTACT_4654], t his is PD. 
If the positive FDG -PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progressi on 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial positive
FDG -PET scan).
If the posi tive FDG -PET at f ollow -up corresponds to a pre -exist ing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis o f the anatomic images, this is not PD.

Verifica tion of Progression: Progression of disease shoul d be verified in cases where 
progression is equivocal. If repeat scans confi rm PD, then progressi on shoul d be declared 
using the date of the initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is

Best response would depend on whether minimum duratio n for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely  still present and in fact the subject had P R, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best

DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Permanent sterilizat ion m ethods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_42451]
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal state is defined as [ADDRESS_306081] a serum follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
>40 m IU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout peri od is a functi on of  the type of  HRT used . The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators shoul d use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral  products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mLat any time during the washout period, the wom an can be consi dered 
postm enopausal.

If not, an additional highly effective method of con traception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contracepti on when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in the protocol. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effect ive contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence

 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT  HISTORY  
Amendment 3  
The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections:  
Change  Section Changed  
Due to an inadvertent operational error, 6 8 patients were 
potentially unblinded.  
In order to properly power for a sensitivity analysis for 
the subset of patients who were not potentially 
unblinded, additional patients will be enrolled  and 
randomized . 
Included introduction of the modified full analysis set 
(mFAS), which exclude s potentially unblind ed patients , 
and will be used for sensitivity analysis . 
Stated that potentially unblinded patients will be 
excluded from the per protocol set (PPS).  
Added power calculation for the full analysis set (FAS) 
with the additional patients.  Clinical Study Protoc ol Synopsis:  Study Design

Extended the duration of the v isit window between 
Visit  1 and Visit 2 from  21 days to 63 days (ie, changed 
start of Visit 1 from -35 days to -77 days) and removed 
the limit of rescreen once  to allow for the seamless 
screening/enrolment of all new patients into the study.

The criterion prior to this amendment requiring 100% 
compliance with application of a stable dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_892810] 7 consecutive days 
immediately before the baseline visit is overly restrictive

 CONFIDENTIAL  Change  Section Changed  
Added rationale for the inclusion of a placebo treatment 
group in the study design and a description of the risks 
and benefits to patients assigned to the placebo treatment 
group.   This change had previously been requested by 
[CONTACT_892890] (Czechia) regulatory agency and had  
been  included in a country -specific amendment, but i t is 
now being incorporated into the global protocol . Section  3.2.1  Rationale for Study Design  
Added a benefit -risk section for treatment of atopic 
dermatitis with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  This change had previously 
been requested by [CONTACT_892891] a country -specific amendment, and 
is now being incorporated into the global protocol.  The 
section summarizes relevant previous Regeneron studies.  
It notes that the safety profile was consistent between 
pediatric and adult populations, a nd that dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892811].  New Section  3.2.4 , Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , and

Corrected the description of age limit of the study 
population from “aged ≥6 to <12 years at the time of 
baseline” to “aged ≥6 to <12 years at the time of 
screening” to be consistent with the wording in the

Revised text to emphasize that the use of very -high-
potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (TCS) is prohibited 
during the study, as their use is not recommended in 
patients under 12 years of age .  Also included examples 
of very-high-potency TCS . Section  7.2 Background Treatment (6th bullet)

Included “injection observation ” for the every 4  week 
regimen in the Schedule of Events table, to identify the 
visits at which the observation occurs.  Section  8.1 - Table  1 Schedule of Events (Screening, 
TCS Standardization, Baseline, and Treatment Period)  
Removed Footnote #18  (shown below)  in the  row for 
Ophthalmology Exam in the Schedule of Events table.  
“In the event the ophthalmology examination cannot be 
performed within the 35 -day screening visit window 1 
the screening period can be extended by 4 weeks; 
however, the 14 -day interval between visits 2 and visits 
3 may not be extended.”  
The rationale for removing this footnote is that all 
patients will now have an additional 4 weeks of 
screening . Section  8.1 - Table  1 Schedule of Events (Screening,

read: Conjunctivitis (any type or etiology), keratitis, or 
blepharitis (only events that are either severe or serious 
or lasting ≥4 weeks will be reported as AESIs).  The 
criteria “or lasting ≥4 weeks” was removed .  In previous

 CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Investigate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892814], ≥6 Years to <12 Years Of Age, with Severe Atopic 
Dermatitis  
Site Locations  
 Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_892815] (EU).  
To be determined  
Objectives  The primary objective  of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892816] (TCS) in patients 
≥6 years to <12 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis (AD).  
The secondary objective  of the study is to assess the safet y of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892817] ≥6 years to <12 years of age 
with severe AD.  
Study Design  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892818]. The study population will include 
patients ≥6  years to <12 years of age with severe AD whose disease cannot be 
adequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910]. Approximately 330 study  
patients are planned to be randomized to 1 of the following treatment groups:  
 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_71760] 2 weeks (Q2W) treatment group: 100 mg for patients 
<30 kg or 200 mg for patients ≥30 kg  
 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_71760] 4 -weeks (Q4W) treatment group: 300 mg  
 placebo group  
The s tudy will consist of the following periods: screening of up to 9 weeks , a 
TCS standardization period of 2 weeks, treatment period of 16  weeks, and a 
follow -up period of 12 weeks.  
After the parents or legal guardians provide an informed assent (as appropria te), 
the patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. During the 
screening period, systemic treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, 
according to the eligibility requirements. The use of TCS will be permitted 
during t he screening period at the discretion of the investigator. Starting on 
day -14, all patients will initiate a standardized TCS treatment regimen and will 
continue this regimen through the end of the study. Patients may be rescreened, 
unless the reason for the screen failure is related to failing the disease severity 
inclusion crite ria. Patients should  apply moisturizers twice daily for at least 
7 days before randomization and continue throughout the study.  
Patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo 
day 1/baseline assessments and will be randomized in  a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by 
                                        [CONTACT_13249]-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  baseline weight group (<30 kg and ≥30kg ) and region (North America/Europe) 
as follows:  
 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W treatment group:  Patients with baseline weight <30  kg 
will receive Q2W subcutaneous (SC) injections of 100 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892819] a loading dose of 200 mg on day 1.  Patients with baseline 
weight ≥30 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 200 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892819] a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1  
 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W treatment group:  Patients regardless of weight will 
receive Q4W  SC injections of 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892820] a loading 
dose of 600 mg on day 1.  
 placebo treatment group: Patients will receive matching placebo 
(including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the 
loading dose). In order to maintain blinding, t he patients in the <30  kg 
weight stratum will be randomly assigned to receive, in a 1:1 ratio, 
either Q2W SC injections of placebo (0.7 mL) matching the 100  mg 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match 
the loading dose) or Q4W S C injections of placebo (2 mL) matching the 
300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (including doubling the amount of placebo on day  1 
to match the loading dose). In the ≥30 kg weight stratum, the patients 
randomized to the placebo group will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either Q2W 
SC injections of placebo (1.14 mL) matching the 200 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
(including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the 
loading dose) or Q4W SC injections of placebo (2 mL) matching the 
300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (including doubling the amount of placebo on  day 1 
to match the loading dose).  
During the treatment period, patients will have weekly in -clinic visits through 
week  4, then every 4 weeks in -clinic visits through week 16, with weekly 
telephone visits in between in -clinic visits. Parents/caregivers wil l be trained on 
injecting study drug during in -clinic visit 3 (day 1) to visit 7 (week 4). During 
weeks in which no in -clinic visit is scheduled, the parent/caregiver will 
administer study drug to the patient. In case the parent/caregiver does not want to 
administer study drug to patient, they may have the clinic staff administer all the 
study drug injections in the clinic. Safety, laboratory, and clinical assessments 
will be performed at specified clinic visits. The end of treatment period visit will 
occur  at week 16. The co -primary endpoints will be assessed at this visit.  
Patients who participate in the study may subsequently be eligible to participate 
in an open -label extension (OLE) study.  
Study Duration  The duration of the study for each patient is a pproximately 16 weeks, excluding 
the screening period, for patients entering the OLE and 28 weeks, excluding the 
screening period for patients who decline to enter the OLE.

 Background Treatment  
 Dose/Route/Schedule:  All patients should  apply  moisturizers (emollients) at least twice daily for at least 
the 7 consecutive days immediately before randomization and are to continue to 
apply moisturizers throughout the study (all 28 weeks where applicable). 
However, to allow adequate assessment of sk in dryness, moisturizers should not 
be applied on the area(s) of nonlesional skin designated for such assessments for 
at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. All types of moisturizers are permitted, 
but patients may not initiate treatment with prescript ion moisturizers (eg, 
ceramide containing products like epi[INVESTIGATOR_892823]®) or moisturizers containing 
additives (ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, filaggrin degradation products) during 
the screening period or during the study. Patients may continue using stable 
doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening visit.  
Starting on day -14, all patients will initiate a standardized TCS treatment 
regimen and will continue this regimen through the end of the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical Plan  Sample Size Consideration:  
Based on the initial sample size of 240 patients  (prior to this amendment) , it is 
estimated that with 80 patients per group, at the 2 -sided 5%  significance level, 
the study will have:  
 97% power to detect a difference of 23% between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W treatment 
and placebo treatment (both in combination with TCS) in the percentage of 
patients who achieve an IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that th e 
percentages are 28% and 5% for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W and placebo, respectively  
 87% power to detect a difference of 17% between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W treatment 
and placebo treatment (both in combination with TCS) in the percentage of 
patients who achieve an IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that the 
percentages are 22% and 5% for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W and placebo, respectively  
 99% power to detect a difference of 51% in the percentages of patients 
achieving EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 
68% an d 17% for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W and placebo, respectively, (both in 
combination with TCS)  
 99% power to detect a difference of 45% in percentages of patients achieving 
EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 62% and 
17% for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W and placebo, respectively, (both in combination with 
TCS)  
Due to an inadvertent operational error, [ADDRESS_1250559] been unblinding are not included in 
the protocol but will be described in the clinical study report. An additional 
approximately 90 patients will be added to the study to ensure that the original 
number of blinded patients for all treatment groups is available for sensitivity 
analyses that exclude the potentially unblinded patients.  This will maintain study 
balance and power.  
The total sample size of the study will be up to approximately 330 patients 
(110 patients per group) , and approximately 262 patients (80, 91 and 91 in Q2W, 
Q4W and placebo group respectively) if excluding the potentially unblinded 
patients. With the sample size o f 330 patients or 262 patients, the power for the 
co-primary endpoints will be greater than 90%.  
Efficacy Analysis Sets:  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses 
will be based on the treatment allocated at randomizati on (as randomized).  All 
efficacy variables will be evaluated in the FAS,  which will be considered to be 
the primary analysis set . 
The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes all randomized patients but 
excludes potentially unblinded patients.  The prim ary endpoint, co -primary 
endpoint, and selected secondary endpoints will be evaluated in the mFAS as 
sensitivity analyses .

 CONFIDENTIAL  The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patients in the FAS except for those who 
are excluded because of major protocol violations. A  preliminary list of potential 
major protocol violation s is provided in Appendix  [ADDRESS_1250560] will be 
generated prior to database lock .  The  PPS will also exclude potentially 
unblinded patients . 
The primary and co -primary endpoint s will also be evaluated in the PPS.  
Analysis Methods:  
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by [CONTACT_68485] (baseline 
weight group and region) will be used for analyzing the percentage of patients 
with IGA 0 or 1 at we ek 16 or percentage of patients with EASI -75 at week  16.  
The Mantel -Fleiss (MF) criterion will be checked, and if it is not met, sensitivity 
analyses including each stratification factor separately in CMH test will be 
conducted.  
To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: For the 
primary efficacy endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if rescue 
treatment is used, the patient will be classified as a nonresponder from the time 
the rescue is used.  
If a patient withdraws fr om study, this patient will be counted as a nonresponder 
for endpoints after withdrawal.  
Sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach 
to determine patient’s status at week 16 will be conducted to assess the 
robustness of  the primary efficacy analysis with regards to handling of missing 
data. The efficacy data will be set to missing after rescue treatment is used, then 
the LOCF method will be used to determine patients’ status at week 16.  
In addition, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted by [CONTACT_892893].  A patient with missing data will be counted as a non -responder. Other 
sensitivity analyses may be conducted.  
Secondary Effic acy Analyses  
For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use the same approach 
as that used for the primary analysis.  
                                        VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 15 of 109 
 CONFIDENTIAL   For continuous endpoints:  
 The multiple imputation (MI) with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
will be used for analysis. Missing data from the FAS will be imputed 40 times 
to generate a complete dataset at each imputation by [CONTACT_892894] (SAS) procedure. These complete datasets will be analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with treatment, rando mization strata (region and 
weight group) and relevant baseline included in the model, and the SAS 
MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences 
by [CONTACT_892895]’s formula.  
 To account  for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: If a 
patient receives rescue treatment, the efficacy data collected after rescue 
treatment is initiated will be treated as missing.  
 In addition to the MI method described previously, sensitivity analyses such 
as ANCOVA model with LOCF and MI method with ANCOVA model on all 
observed data regardless of rescue use will be conducted. Additional details 
on these sensitivity analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).  
Multiplicity  Consideration  
A hierarchical procedure for multiplicity adjustment will be used to control the 
overall Type -1 error rate at 0.05 for the primary endpoint and the secondary 
endpoints across the 2 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_725725]. The hierarchical testing 
procedure at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level will be used for all comparisons 
with the placebo.  
Safety Analyses  
Safety analysis will be based on the SAF. This includes reported TEAEs and 
other safety information (eg, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 
12-lead ECG results).

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a pruritic skin condition characterized 
by a chronic, relapsing form of skin inflammation, a disturbance of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] -barrier 
function associated with immune changes in the skin, and a high prevalence of 
immunoglobulin  E (IgE) -mediated sensitization to food and environmental allergens 
(Bieber  2008 ). 
Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants and children ( Mortz 2015 ).  
The disease affects over 20% of children in many industrialized countries (Deckers 2012 ).  A 
total of 45% of all cases of AD begin within the first 6 months of life, 60% begin during the first 
year, and 85% begin before 5 years of age (Kay 1994 ).  Phase 3 of the International Study of 
Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (IS AAC) showed a 1 -year period preva lence rate for AD in 
the 6 to 7 year age group to be 15% or more in Australia, England, and Scandinavia 
(Asher  2006 ).  A study conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (US) in school -going children aged 5 to 
9 years  old showed similar prevalence rate of around 17% ( Laughter 2000 ). 
The clinical pattern of AD varies with age.  Infants typi[INVESTIGATOR_892824], forehead, or scalp, which are exud ative and intensely pruritic.  The

suffering from eczema and type [ADDRESS_1250569] scores than those of diabetic children (Su 1997 ).  
Often severe, pruritus is a universal finding in AD and often results in sleep disruption, 
irritability, and generalized stress for both the affected patients as well a s family members 
(Kim 2012 ).  
Of particular interest in children is the phenomenon of “Atopic March” which is characterized by 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_197363].  In general, the clinical signs 
of AD and of food allergies predate the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis, suggesting 
that AD is an “entry point” for subsequent allergic disease (Spergel 2003 ).  Severity of AD is 
correlated with development of asthma and a llergic rhinitis (Zheng 2011 ).  The prevalence of 
asthma in children [ADDRESS_1250570] 4 years of their 
life has been estimated to be around 35% (Van der Hulst 2007 ).  In a prospective study on 
‘Atopic March’ in which children with eczema during infancy were followed, 47% of patients 
had allergic rhino -conjunctivitis and 29% had asthma (Ekback 2014 ) by [CONTACT_14898] 10  years.  
More severe skin dise ase is directly correlated with a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_291985]

severe comorbidities (Silverberg 2013 ).  The incidence of m ental health disorders like anxiety,

 CONFIDENTIAL  depression, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is also higher in children with 
AD (Yaghmaie 2013 ).  The course of the disease in school -going children can be complicated by 
[CONTACT_892896] -threatening complications like eczema herpeticum ( Luca 2012 ). 
Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of genetics, defects in skin barrier function, 
environmental exposure, and immunologic responses.  Type 2  helper T cell (Th2) -mediated 
immune response is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD.  The skin lesions 
of AD are characterized by [CONTACT_892897]2 cytokines, such as 
interleukin (IL) -4 and IL -13, and by [CONTACT_185475] n infiltration of Th2 cells.  The elevated IgE responses 
and eosinophilia observed in the majority of patients with AD reflects an increased expression of 
the Th2 cytokines IL -4 and IL -13 (Leung 1999 ).  Type 2 helper T cell -associat ed cytokines 
regulate important barrier -related functions, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_197365].  These cytokines inhibit the production of major terminal differentiation 
proteins, such as loricrin, filaggrin, involucrin , and the antimicrobial proteins human beta 
defensin 2 and 3, which in turn, is associated with development of AD (Howell 2007, 
Guttman -Yassky 2011a, Guttman -Yassky  2011b ).  The Th2 cytokines also act on keratinocytes 
and induce pro duction of chemokines, including chemokine (C -C motif) ligand 17 (also known 
as thymus and activation -regulated chemokine [TARC]), and chemokine (C -C motif) ligand  26 
(also known as eotaxin -3), which are chemo -attractants for Th2 cells and eosinophils, thu s, 
perpetuating the inflammatory response.  Since activation of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling precedes 
the release of proinflammatory mediators, antagonism of these cytokines has the potential to 
reduce the Th2  response and provide therapeutic benefit.  
There is  currently a high unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy for AD in young 
children.  Nonpharmacological management of AD, which includes environmental control 
measures (eg,  avoidance of antigen and skin irritants) and skin care measures (eg, ma intaining 
the hydration of the skin through the use of emollients) play a supportive role, especially in 
children with moderate -to-severe disease.  Pharmacological management of AD in children is 
mainly limited to topi[INVESTIGATOR_892825] (TCS) and topi[INVESTIGATOR_110404] (TCIs).  However, long -term use of TCS in children is not recommended because of 
the risk of irreversible skin atrophy, dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], acneiform eruptions, and risks associated 
with systemic absorption (eg, gro wth retardation, hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_173747], etc). 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726], such as tacrolimus and pi[INVESTIGATOR_031], are also used in AD as an 
alternative to or in combination with TCS.  The more effective TCI products (tacrolimus 0.1%) 
are not  approved for use in children aged 6 to 11 years old.  Moreover, the use of TCI is 
frequently associated with skin irritation.  Furthermore, a possible increased risk of malignancy 
(lymphoma and skin cancers) has been noted for TCIs (refer to products’ US prescribing 
information).  
Systemic agents are used off -label in children aged 6 to 11 years old (cyclosporine, systemic 
steroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil).  A recent survey conducted in 
Europe, “European TREatment of Severe At opic Eczema in Children Taskforce (TREAT)” 
found that approximately 70% of respondents initiated systemic therapy for children with severe 
AD (Proudfoot 2013 ).  All of these systemic agents have significant side effects in children,  
including stunted growth, diabetes, cutaneous atrophy, hypertension, osteoporosis, and rebound 
exacerbation after discontinuation (corticosteroids), myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity 
(methotrexate), nephrotoxicity and hypertension (cyclosporine), increa sed risk of malignancies

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
In pediatric patients ≥6 years to <12 years old who are suffering f rom severe AD that is 
inadequately responsive to topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491] (TCS with/without TCIs), treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], 
in addition to TCS, will result in clinically relevant and statistically significant incremental 
benefit versus treatment with TCS alone, as measured by [CONTACT_892900]’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear disease) and 
Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) -75 (at least 75% reduction in EASI score from 
baseline).  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
This study is part of the pediatric clinical development plan for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24918].  The primary 
purpose of the study is to provide data on the use of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892831], ≥6 years to <[ADDRESS_1250573] more closely the anticipated real -life use of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  This design seeks to maximize clinical benefit for patients enrolled in the study. 
Although the target population consists of patients who are inadequately responsive to TCS, 
these patients are s till expected to receive some benefit from the use of TCS.  Data from phase  3 
studies in adults (R668 -AD-1334, R668 -AD-1416, and R668 -AD-1224) in which dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892832] (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416) and concomitantly with 
TCS ( R668 -AD-1224) showed that for certain clinical endpoints, the combination regimen was 
more efficacious than monotherapy.  Moreover, this design will also generate data on the 
potential steroid -sparing effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  
The 16 -week treatment duration is  the same as in 2 of the adult pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518] (R668 -AD-1416 
and R668 -AD-1334).  This duration has been chosen because it is expected that the vast majority 
of patients will achieve maximum therapeutic effect for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892833].  Moreover, in 
previo us studies, the selected dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892834].  The [ADDRESS_1250574] dose, ie, the time for serum concent rations to decline to 
nondetectable levels (below the lower limit of quantification) in most patients.  
The co -primary endpoints chosen in the study (proportion of patients achieving IGA 0 or 1 and 
proportion of patients with ≥75% reduction in EASI from bas eline [EASI -75] at week 16) are the 
same as those used in the adult pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416).  These 
endpoints are both investigator -assessed outcome measures of objective AD signs, which are 
broadly validated in drug development for  this indication.  Based on prior discussions with 
health authorities for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_892835] (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416), it is 
expected that different health authorities will request different primary endpoints for this study 
(for example, t he US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested IGA 0/1 as the primary

 CONFIDENTIAL  endpoint in the adult AD program while European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested both 
EASI -75 and IGA  0/1 as co -primary endpoints).  Eczema  Area and Severity Index  has been 
validated  in the pediatric population including in patients aged 6 to 11 years old in a prior study 
(Barbier 2004 ).  These endpoints were included in the Pediatric Investigation  Plan and Pediatric 
Study Plan and agreed to by [CONTACT_892901], respectively.  
As the efficacy and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892836], a placebo control is a scientifically essential element of the study design to enable 
adequate assessment and interpretation of the treatment effect and safety profile.  It is 
particularly relevant for pediatric patients, in whom spontaneous remission of AD over time has 
been described.  Several features of the protocol are intended to mitigate any potential adver se 
effects in patients randomized to the placebo group:  
 Mandatory requirement for use of concomitant topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]  
 Starting on day -14, all patients will initiate a standardized TCS treatment 
regimen with a medium -potency TCS that may be adjusted  based on clinical 
response.  T opi[INVESTIGATOR_892837] a patient 
population selected for their inadequate response to TCS.  
 Availability of rescue treatm ent 
 Patients who experience AD exacerbations or intolerable symptoms may receive 
rescue treatment with a range of treatments available to all patients with AD 
(except for very -high-potency TCS , as their use is not recommended in patients 
<12 years of age ):  high-potency TCS, systemic corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal 
immunosuppressive drugs  
 Open-Label Extension Study (OLE)  
 Patients who participate in the study may subsequently be eligible to participate in 
an OLE study.  All patients will be offered the opp ortunity to screen for entry into 
the OLE study at the end of the treatment period (week 16).  Additional details 
concerning eligibility for the OLE can be found in  Section  7.9. 
As described in  Section  5.3.1 , an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), will monitor 
patient safety by [CONTACT_197480] a program -wide level . 
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose justification for pediatric patients aged ≥6 years to <12 years is based on the observed 
efficacy and safety in the dose ranging study in ad ult AD patients (R668 -AD-1021), the observed 
efficacy and safety in the phase 3 monotherapy studies in adult AD patients (R668 -AD-1334 and 
R668 -AD-1416), the observed PK data, efficacy and safety results in a pediatric AD study of 
patients ≥6 to <18 years old (R668 -AD-1412).  The selection of these dosing regimens is further 
supported by [CONTACT_618054].  
The adult dose -ranging study evaluated dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892838] 300 mg QW, 300 mg Q2W, 
300 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W), 200 mg Q2W, and 100 mg Q4W  versus placebo, 
administered for 16 weeks.  All 5 dose regimens were efficacious.  The mean pharmacodynamic

multiple endpoints, followed closely by  [CONTACT_941] 300 mg Q2W dose regimen.  Differences in the 
efficacy and safety outcomes between the 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W were relatively small.  
The 200  mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W doses also showed good efficacy responses but were 
numerically inferior to the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW regimens for the majority of efficacy 
endpoints. The efficacy of the 100 mg Q4W regimen (100 mg total monthly dose) appeared to be 
sub-optimal  
Study R668 -AD-1412 was a phase 2a, multicenter, open -label, ascending -dose, sequential -cohort 
study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and efficacy of single -dose and 
repeat -doses of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892839] (for 
adolescents ≥12 to <18 years old) or severe AD (for school -going children ≥6 to <12 years old) 
that was not adequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969].  The 2 assessed dose regimens at 
2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg correspond to the weight normalized dose in adults at 150 mg and 300 mg, 
respectively.  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892840] 2 mg/kg and 
4 mg/kg for 4 weeks was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in both 
pediatric age groups included in that study.  There was a higher incidence of TEAEs following 
single and repeated weekly administration of 4 mg/kg compared to 2 mg/kg in both age -groups. 
This was driven by a higher incidence of nasopharyngitis and skin infections in the 4 mg/kg dose 
arm versus the 2 mg/kg dose arm.  However, most of the adverse events (AEs) were mild in 
intensity, transient in nature, and not related to study drug.  The most common AE reported after 
both single doses and repeated weekly doses was nasopharyngitis.  
In children aged ≥6 to <12 years, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_197339] a single dose of either 2 mg/k g or 
4 mg/kg, in the study R668 -AD-1412, induced a significant  and rapid reduction of disease 
activity in patients at week 2 (37% and 33% reduction in EASI score from baseline for 2  mg/kg 
and 4  mg/kg doses, respectively).  Repeated weekly doses of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_125308] b led to a further 
improvement in disease severity in patients in both dose groups (76% and 63% reduction in 
EASI score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses, respectively, at week 12).  There did 
not appear to be a clear dose response, as the [ADDRESS_1250576] limited the 
precision of this study, but these data are consistent with saturation of the IL -4 receptor a fter 
4 weekly doses of either 2  mg/kg or 4 mg/kg.  
The collective clinical data on the exposure versus efficacy and safety in the adults and pediatric 
population as observed  to date supports a similar exposure -response relationship for efficacy and 
safety between the adult and pediatric pop ulations down to 6 years of age and justify the 
approach of selecting dose regimens for this study based on the criteria of matching adult 
exposure.  
To account for body  size difference in the pediatric population and taking into account the 
observed large therapeutic indices of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a tiered fixed dosing regimen was chosen over 
weight based (mg/kg) dosing for ongoing development.  This approach reduces the risk of dosing 
errors that can occur with weight -based dosing, as well as allowing for dosing co nvenience by 
[CONTACT_892902] a prefilled syringe/device.

 CONFIDENTIAL  A population PK model was used to describe the exposure of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892841].  This model, initially based on drug concentration data from studi es 
conducted in adults, was further informed by [CONTACT_892903](s) conducted in 
pediatric patients (R668 -AD-1412).  The PK modeling for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892842], with exposure being inversely  correlated with 
body weight.  Outside of the effect of body weight on PK, the exis ting data do not suggest an 
age-related effect on exposure.  
Data gathered from NHANES (n=1269) show that median weight in the children aged 6 
to11 years old is = 32 kg (Q1=25, Q3=42).  Simulations from the PK model suggest that the 
adult dose regimens (300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W) may lead to systemic exposure in these 
children that is greater than the maximum exposure observed in adults.  Hence, these doses are 
not supp orted by [CONTACT_892904].

In addition, in study DRI12544 (a phase 2b study in patients with moderate to severe 
uncontrolled asthma) (300 mg Q2W) a strongly positive benefit -risk was ident ified.  He nce, the 
proposed 200  mg Q2W dosing regimen for children aged ≥6 to <12 years old weighing >[ADDRESS_1250578] a significant clinical benefit with an appropriate safety profile, under the 
assumption that PK/PD relationship is similar in pediatrics a nd adult patients.  
A dose regimen of 100 mg Q2W SC has not been evaluated to date in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_173731]. 
However, based on simulations from the PK model, the use of 100 mg Q2W is expected to 
provide mean exposure in children ≥6 to <12 years old who weig h <30 kg that is similar to that 
for 200  mg Q2W in children >30 kg, thereby [CONTACT_892905].  Moreover, the 100 mg dose can be delivered using a lower volume of injection. 
Since volume of injection has been show n to be an important factor impacting the tolerability of 
SC injections (Heise 2014 ), the smaller injection volume associated with the100 mg injection 
may offer some advantage in this population.  
The 300 mg Q4W regimen was chosen t o be included as a dosing option with less frequent

(AUC) were lowe r than for the [ADDRESS_1250579] shown that in children with weight >30 kg, the steady -state exposure was  
higher for the 300 mg Q4W regimen than in adults with the same regimen, but is not expected to 
exceed that for adults receiving 300 mg Q2W.  
In children with weight <30 kg, simulated mean weekly AUC at steady -state for the 300  mg 
Q4W regimen was similar to that in adults receiving 300 mg Q2W, while C max was higher and 
Ctrough was lower.  Data gathered from this dose regimen will enable PK/PD modeling to better 
characterize the exposure -response relationship in pediatric patients.  A less frequent dosing 
regimen is expected to enhance compliance, especially in a pediatric population.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3.2.3.  Safety Considerations  
R668 -AD-1412 was a phase 2 study to evaluate the PK and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_197374] 
≥6 years to <18 years, with moderate -to-severe AD.  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892845] 2 mg/kg and 4  mg/kg for 4 weeks was generally well tolerated with an 
acceptable safety profile in both pediatric age groups (12 to 17 years old and 6 to 11 years old) 
included in this study.  There was a higher incidence of TEAEs after administration of a single 
dose o f 4 mg/kg as compared to 2mg/kg dose in both age -groups.  Similarly, there was a higher 
incidence of TEAEs after administration of repeated weekly doses of 4 mg/kg as compared to 
repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg in both age -groups.  This was driven by a hi gher incidence of 
nasopharyngitis and skin infections in the 4 mg/kg as compared to 2 mg/kg dose arm.  The most 
common AE reported after both single doses and repeated weekly doses was nasopharyngitis.  
In children 12 to <18 years old, there were 2 SAEs rep orted in each dose group (in the 2  mg/kg 
group, the SAEs reported were palpi[INVESTIGATOR_892846]; in the 4 mg/kg group, the SAEs 
reported were staphylococcal skin infection and infected AD).  In children 6 to 11 years old, 
2 patients in the 4 mg/kg dose  group had serious TEAEs (2 events of exacerbation of AD, septic 
arthritis of the hip joint, and infected AD).  None of these serious TEAEs was assessed by [CONTACT_892906] -related.  The events of infected AD and staphylococcal skin infections 
occurred in patients who were not being treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892847] 
(patients were either in follow -up period of part A or in follow -up period of part B).  It is well 
known that a very high proportion of patients with AD have skin colon ization (Ong 2010 ) and 
patients with AD are prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_892848].  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], by [CONTACT_892907], should 
lead to a reduction in skin infections.  This is supported by [CONTACT_892908] 3 trials in adults with 
AD in which th e incidence of serious and severe infections was numerically higher in the 
placebo group as compared to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (0.5% to 1% dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24767] 2% to 3% placebo).  
Positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) was observed in 50 patients (64.9 %) at any time, 31 of which 
(40.3% out of total) were categorized as persistent treatment -emergent ADA.  The rate of 
occurrence of persistent ADA were similar across cohorts with a trend of higher rates in the 
adolescents compared with school -going children.  Six patients (12.0%) had high titers 
(>10,000), 4 from the 2 mg/kg groups and 2 from 4 mg/kg groups.  Within each age group, there 
also seemed to be a trend for higher incidence of persistent ADA in lower dose cohorts as 
compared to higher dose cohorts.  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181151] i n patients with high titers were 
markedly reduced compared to those with a negative response, or low or moderate titers.  These 
patients had an inferior clinical response to the study drug as compared to the overall study 
population.  The high titer ADAs w ere not associated with any systemic symptoms of 
hypersensitivity in these patients, although one of these patients did experience an injection site 
reaction, which was mild in intensity.  
Standard safety monitoring used in previous trials with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892849].  An internal safety monitoring team will be reviewing blinded data at regular 
intervals during the study to monitor the safety of patients.  An Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) overseeing the entire d upi[INVESTIGATOR_892850].

[IP_ADDRESS].  Benefits  
The efficacy and safety of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892851] [ADDRESS_1250580] clinical study of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_474714] 6 years to <18 years o ld has been 
completed (R668 -AD-1412).  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892852] (6 years to 11  years 
and 12  to <18 years) consistent with that observed in adul ts. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Risks  
Of the adverse drug reactions identified in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892853], injection 
site reactions were very common (≥10%).  Common adverse reactions (≥1% and <10%) included 
conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, eye pruritus, blepha ritis, oral herpes, eosinophilia , and 
headache . 
Serum sickness and serum sickness -like reactions occurred very rarely (<0.01%) (Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12460] 
[SmPC], 2017).  
In the pediatric trial, the safety profile was consistent with that reported in adults.  There were no 
new safety signal s detected with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892854].  
One serious case each of serum sickness and serum sickness -like reaction (both associated with 
high ADA titers) were reported in adult AD studies.  Additionally, there has been 1 report  of 
anaphylaxis considered related to study drug by [CONTACT_892909] (Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 
[Investigator Brochure, 2017].  No AEs of systemic hypersensitivity were reported in the 
pediatric study.   In study R668 -AD-1652, patients will be monitored at the trial site for [ADDRESS_1250581] 3 visits at which study drug is administered to facilitate detection and 
treatment of any immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug . 
A hig her incidence of conjunctivitis -related events has been observed in dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] -treated 
subjects as compared to placebo in the AD studies.  A predominant number of these cases were 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, reported recovered/recovering during the active study 
periods , and infrequently led t o study drug discontinuation.  Neither a consistent dose response 
nor a consistent time to onset of these events ha ve been observed . 
Similarly, a higher incidence of injection site reactions has been observed in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892855], consistent w ith the subcutaneous injection of a protein biologic.  There have 
been no serious events of ISR, and these events have infrequently led to study drug 
discontinuation (Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] [Investigator Brochure, 2017]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Risk/Benefit Conclusion  
The safety data availab le to date , in conjunction with the risk monitoring and mitigation 
strategies in the study protocol, and the clinical benefit of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892856] , support a favorable benefit -risk profile for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] .

5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study in which study 
treatments (dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]/placebo) will be administered concomitantly with TCS.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_1250587] of the following periods ( Figure  2):  
1. Screening of up to 9 weeks , 
2. TCS standardization period of 2 weeks,  
3. Treatment period of 16 weeks , and  
4. Follow -up of 12 weeks (for patients who do not enter the OLE)  
After the parents or legal guardians provide informed consent and patients provide assent, the 
patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit.  During the screening period, 
systemic treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicabl e, according to the eligibility 
requirements (provided in Section  6.2.1  and Section 6.2.2 ).  The use of TCS (±TCI) will be

Patients  who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo day 1/baseline 
assessments and will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by [CONTACT_197484] (<30  kg 
and ≥30 kg) ( Figure  1) and region (North America, Europe) as follows:   
 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W treatment group:   
 Patients with baseline weight <30 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 100  mg 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_71763] (0.7 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution) from week 2 to week 14, following 
a loading dose of 200 mg on day 1.  
 Patients with baseline weight ≥30 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 200  mg 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (1.14 mL of a 175 mg/mL solution) from week 2 to week 14, 
following a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1  
 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W treatment group:  all patients regardless of weight will receive Q4W 
SC injections of 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (2 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution) from week  4 to 
week  12, following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1.  
 placebo treatment group: Patients will receive matching placebo (including doubling 
the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose).  In order to maintain 
blinding, the patients in the <30 kg weight stratum will be randomly assigned to 
receiv e, in a 1:1 ratio, either Q2W SC injections of placebo (0.7 mL) matching the 
100 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the 
loading dose) or Q4W SC injections of placebo (2 mL) matching the 300 mg 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (including doub ling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading 
dose).  In the ≥30 kg weight stratum, the patients randomized to the placebo group 
will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either Q2W SC injections of placebo (1.14 mL) matching 
the 200  mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (including  doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match

patients weighing ≥[ADDRESS_1250589] weekly in -clinic visits through week 4, and then 
in-clinic visits Q4W through week 16 with we ekly telephone visits in between the in -clinic 
visits.  Parents/caregivers will be trained on injecting study drug during in -clinic visit 3 (day  1), 
visit 5 (week 2), and visit 7 (week 4) (this only applies to patients who will receive Q2W 
treatment during  the study).  During weeks in which no in -clinic visit is scheduled, the 
parent/caregiver will administer study drug to the patient. In case the parent/caregiver does not 
want to administer study drug to patient, they may have the clinic staff administer a ll the study 
drug injections in the clinic.  Safety, laboratory, and clinical assessments will be performed at 
specified clinic visits, as noted in Table  1.  The end of treatment period visit will occur at 
week  16, two weeks after the last dose of study drug for patients randomized to the Q2W 
treatment group or placebo Q2W gr oup, and [ADDRESS_1250590] data collected at all remaining scheduled vis its until

dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W treatment group (300 mg Q4W), or plac ebo group (Q2W or Q4W).  
6.2. Study Population  
The study population includes pediatric patients (aged ≥6 to <12 years at the time of screening ) 
who have severe AD that cannot be adequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_197349].  
6.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
A patient  must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:  
1. Male or female ≥6 to <12 years of age at time of screening visit  
2. Diagnosis of AD according to the American Academy of Dermatology consensus criteria 
(Eichenfie ld 2003 ) at screening visit  
3. Chronic AD diagnosed at least 1 year prior to the screening visit  
4. IGA = 4 at screening and baseline visits  
5. EASI ≥21 at the screening and baseline visits  
6. BSA ≥15% at screening and baseline visits  
7. Baseline worst itch score weekly average score for maximum itch intensity ≥4  
NOTE: Baseline worst itch average score for maximum itch intensity will be determined 
based on the average of daily worst itch scores for maximum itch intensity (the daily 
score ranges from 0 to 10) during the 7 days immediately preceding randomization. A 
minimum of 4 daily scores out of the 7 days is required to calculate the baseline average 
score.  A complete daily score consists of answers to both questions.   
 “What was the worst itch you had today?”  
 “What was  the worst itch you had last night?”  
For patients who do not have at least 4 daily scores reported during the 7  days 
immediately preceding the planned randomization date, randomization should be 
postponed until this requirement is met, but without exceedin g the 77-day maximum 
duration for screening  plus TCS standardization .

 CONFIDENTIAL  31. Patient is female of childbea ring potential* and sexually active, who is unwilling to use 
highly effective methods of contraception prior to the initial dose, during the study and 
for at least [ADDRESS_1250594] dose of study drug. Highly effective contraceptive 
measures include stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) 
hormonal contraception (oral, vaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal 
contraception (oral, injectabl e, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation 
initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device (IUD); 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomized 
partner; and or sexual abstinenc e**. 
* For the purpose of this study, any female who has had her first menstrual period 
(menarche) and is sexually active will be considered to be of childbearing potential. 
Female patients who are not of childbearing potential at the start of the study bu t have 
the onset of menarche during the course of the study and are sexually active will also 
have to follow adequate birth control methods to continue participation in the study.  
** Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if define d as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual li festyle of the 
subject.  
NOTE:  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
6.3. Premature Withdrawal fro m the Study  
A patient  has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  The parent/caregiver has the right to withdraw permission to have the patient 
participate in the study at any time, for any reason, and w ithout repercussion.  
The investigator and sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study in the event of 
an intercurrent illness, AE, treatment failure, protocol violation, cure, and for administrative, or 
other reasons.  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patient s who withdraw prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study assessments 
per Section  8.1. 
6.4. Replacement of Patients  
Patients  prematurely discontinued from the study or study treatment  will not be replaced.

delivers 200 mg of study drug (1.14 mL of a 175 mg/mL solution).  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 150 mg/mL: Each 2.25 mL single -use, prefilled glass syringe with snap -off cap 
delivers 300 mg  of study drug (2.0 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution)  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 150 mg/ml: Each 0.7 mL single -use, prefilled glass syringe with snap -off cap 
delivers 100 mg study drug (0.7 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution).  
Placebo matching dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892860] 
(ie, active substance, anti -IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody).  Three matching placebo formulations 
will be used:   
1. 2 mL placebo matching 300 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24881]  
2. 1.14 mL placebo matching 200 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24881]  
3. 0.7 mL  placebo matching 100 mg dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892861] 1 of the treatment regimens described in Section 5.1. 
Study drug will be administered per the schedule described in Section  8.1.  
Subcutaneous injection sites of the study drug should be alternated among  the different quadrants 
of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas), upper thighs, and upper arms so that the same 
site is not injected for [ADDRESS_1250595] ug should be administered only into areas of 
normal -looking skin (for patients with 100% BSA involvement, the injection should be 
administered into as near normal looking skin as possible).  Instructions for recording and 
reporting injection site reactions  will be provided in the study reference manual.  
Parents/caregivers will have the option to administer study drug outside the study site during 
weeks in which no in -clinic visit is scheduled (for patients receiving Q2W treatment).  The study 
staff will tra in the parent/caregiver on preparation and administration of study drug on day [ADDRESS_1250596] of the 2 injections required for the loading dose.  The parent/caregiver 
will administer the second injection required for the loading dose under  the supervision of the 
clinic staff.  The parent/caregiver will administer study drug under the supervision of the clinic 
staff at visits 5 and 7 (weeks 2 and 4, respectively) and at other in -clinic visits.  Patients will be 
monitored at the study site fo r a minimum of [ADDRESS_1250597] 3 doses of study drug (visits  3 
[day 1], 5  [week 2], and 7 [week 4] for patients receiving Q2W treatment and visits 3 [day  1], 
7 [week 4], and 11 [week 8] for patients receiving Q4W treatment); vital signs (sitting bl ood 
pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , and body temperature ) and AE assessments will be done at 
30 minutes (±10 minutes) post dose and then at 2 hours (±15 minutes).  The parent/caregiver will 
administer study drug outside of the clinic during weeks i n which no clinic visit is scheduled.  
Parents (or caregivers) who prefer to have the clinic staff administer study drug may choose to 
have injections administered in the clinic.

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.2. Background Treatment  
All patients should  apply moisturizers (emollients) at  least twice daily for at least the 
7 consecutive days immediately before randomization.  After randomization, patients are 
required to continue to apply moisturizers throughout the study (all 28  weeks where applicable). 
However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied for at 
least 8 hours before each clinic visit.  All types of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may 
not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers (eg, ceramide containing products like  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_892862]®) or moisturizers containing additives (ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, filaggrin 
degradation products) during the screening period or during the study.  Patients may continue 
using stable doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening v isit. 
Starting on day -14, all patients are required to initiate treatment with TCS using a standardized 
regimen according to the following guidelines:  
 Apply medium -potency TCS once daily to areas with active lesions.  Based on 
investigator discretion, low -potency TCS may be used once daily on areas of thin skin 
(face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.) or for areas 
where continued treatment with medium -potency TCS is considered unsafe.   
 Once the patient achieves an IGA s core of 2 or less, decrease the frequency of use of 
medium -potency TCS to 3 times per week, and then stop once lesions are clear 
(IGA  0). Patients should be instructed to use TCS only on active lesions, and to stop 
use of TCS if lesions clear completely in  between clinic visits.  
 If lesions return, reinstitute treatment with medium -potency TCS, with the same 
step-down approach described above upon lesion resolution.  
 In case there are signs of local (eg, impending skin atrophy), or systemic TCS toxicity 
with medium -potency steroids, patients should be switched to low -potency steroids.  
 For lesions persisting or worsening under daily treatment with medium -potency TCS, 
patients may be treated (rescued) with high -potency TCS (super -potent/ very -high-
potency steroi ds are not allowed even for rescue), unless higher potency TCS are 
considered unsafe (a potent TCS should normally be restricted to use on non -delicate 
skin sites [excluding face, flexures, groin], and should not be used for a prolonged 
period in order to prevent the development of cutaneous atrophy and adrenal axis 
suppression. Low -potency steroids should normally be used for delicate skin sites 
(face, flexures, groin) during these flares.   
 A list of steroids that can be used during the study will be prov ided to the 
investigators as part of the study manual.  The use of very -high potency or 
superpotent TCS is prohibited during the study , as their use is not recommended in 
patients under [ADDRESS_1250598] tolerance issues with any of these 
steroids, and/or to the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_190845] a particular formulation (eg, hypersensitivity), or 
if they are not commercially available, they may substitute with products of the same 
potency from the list provided in the study manual. It is recommended that patie nts 
use triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream, fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% cream, or 
clobetasone butyrate 0.05% for medium potency, and hydrocortisone acetate 1%

 CONFIDENTIAL  cream for low potency.  If rescue with TCS is needed, it is recommended that patients 
use momet asone furoate 0.1% ointment as high -potency steroid.  If patients have 
tolerance issues with any of these steroids or if they are not commercially available, 
they may substitute with products of the same potency from the list provided in the 
study referenc e manual.  
 A 60 -minute interval between the application of emollients and TCS is recommended, 
wherever applicable.   
 Patients will return TCS tubes at each clinic visit through week 16, and these tubes 
will be weighed by [CONTACT_892912].  
7.3. Rescue Treatment  
Rescue treatment for AD may be provided to patients during the study.  Investigators will be 
required to perform an IGA assessment prior to starting rescue treatment and initiate rescue 
treatment only in patients who  either have an IGA score = 4, or have intolerable symptoms.  If 
possible, investigators are encouraged to consider rescue initially with topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786] (eg, 
high-potency TCS) and to escalate to systemic medications only for patients who do not respond 
adequately after at least 7  days of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786].  Patients may continue study treatment if 
rescue consists of topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910].   The use of very -high-potency or superpotent TCS is 
prohibited in this study, even as rescue treatment , as their use is  not recommended in patients 
under 12  years of  age.  Very -high-potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_892863]:  
 Betamethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_892864] 0.05% ointment  
 Clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.05% solution, foam, cream or ointment  
 Diflorasone diacetate 0.05% ointment  
 Halobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.05% cream or ointment  
Patients who receive systemic corticosteroids or systemic non -steroidal immunosuppressive 
drugs (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate -mofetil, azathioprine, etc) as rescue 
medication during the study w ill be discontinued permanently from the study drug.  All patients 
will be asked to complete the scheduled study visits and assessments whether or not they 
complete study treatment and whether or not they receive rescue treatment for AD.  Investigators 
should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (eg, disease severity 
scores, safety laboratory tests) immediately before administering any rescue treatment.  An 
unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose, if necessary. For the purpos e of efficacy 
analysis, patients who receive rescue treatment during the study will be considered treatment 
failures.

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.4.2.  Study  Drug Discontinuation  
Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study 
will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patient s who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked to complete study assessments, per 
Section  8.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently di scontinued in the event of:  
 Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]  
 Diagnosis of a malignancy during study  
 Evidence of pregnancy  
 Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis  and other infections 
whose nature  or course may suggest an immuno -compromised status  
 Severe laboratory abnormalities that are deemed to be related to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]:  
 Neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 103/μL 
 Platelet count ≤50 × 103/μL 
 ALT and/or AST values greater than 3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN 
(unless elevated bilirubin is related to confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome)  
 Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN  (for more than 2 weeks)  
 Treatment with any prohibited concomitant medication or procedure ( Section  7.8.1 ). 
NOTE: The use of TCI is prohibited during the 2 -week TCS standardization period 
leading up the baseline visit, and the treatment  and follow -up periods. The use of 
very-high-potency or superpotent TCS is not allowed throughout the study  (as their 
use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age ). However, high -potency 
TCS can be used as rescue. In this situation, the study drug will be continued.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinua tion of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing may be temporarily discontinued in the event of:  
 Clinically important laboratory abnormalities, such as:  
 ALT or AST 3 × ULN but ≤5 × ULN  
 Neutrophil count <1.5 × 103/µL but >0.5 × 103/µL 
 Platelet count ≤100 × 103/µL but >50 × 103/µL 
 CPK >5 × ULN  
 Serum creatinine >1.5 × ULN  
 Eosinophils >5000/ μL

 CONFIDENTIAL   Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) where a ca usal 
relationship to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_474754] (ie, an alternative  cause is 
evident). In these cases, study treatment will be discontinued while the clinical 
circumstances are being assessed but it may be resumed when the laboratory 
parameters n ormalize sufficiently. A decision to resume treatment will be made 
jointly by [CONTACT_173875].  
 Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery  
 An infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, 
antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agents, or requires oral treatment with such agents for 
longer than 2 weeks  
After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may 
resume at the d iscretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_197437]. A 
decision to discontinue study drug and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be discussed with 
the medical monitor. Note that dosing may NOT be resumed if patient met co nditions for 
permanently discontinuing study drug described in Section 7.3. The investigator may suspend 
study treatment at any time, even without c onsultation with the medical monitor, if the urgency 
of the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best 
interest. However, the medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_892913] d iscontinuation. Resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation 
should always be discussed with the medical monitor.  
7.5. Management of Acute Reactions  
Acute systemic reactions following injection of study drug (SC) should be treated using clinica l 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typi[INVESTIGATOR_24896].  
7.6. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 330 patients will be randomized , stratified  by [CONTACT_682741] (<30 kg or ≥30  kg) 
and region (North America , Europe),  to 1 of  the treatment groups described in Section 5.1 
according to a central randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_161467]

 CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Patient Assessment of Prurit us Using Worst Itch Scale  
The worst itch scale is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of 
their pruritus (itch). This is an 11 -point scale (0 to 10) in which [ADDRESS_1250612] itching possibl e. Patients will be asked the following 2 questions:  
“What was the worst itch you had today?”  
“What was the worst itch you had last night?”  
Patients will be asked to provide answers to these 2 questions daily throughout the entire study 
(screening period, treatment period, and follow -up period; see time point in Section  8.1).  Both 
questions will be answered in the evening (it is re commended that the questions be answered and 
the responses provided in the diary in the 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM local time window).  The daily 
worst itch score will be calculated as the worse of the scores for the [ADDRESS_1250613] itch score at the  
screening and baseline visits. Clinical sites will check and remind patients to complete the diary 
at each visit.  
This questionnaire measures concept(s), which are known only/best to the patient  suffering from 
AD.  As such the questionnaire is designed for self -report.  Where possible the patient should 
read and complete the questionnaire alone. Where required, a caregiver (parent or other) can read 
the questions and response options aloud to the  person with AD.  However, it is important that 
the patient’s selected responses to the questions are entered directly into the questionnaire.  The 
caregiver must not influence or question the response given by [CONTACT_892918]. This should

[IP_ADDRESS].  Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index  
The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on the 
QOL in children (Lewis -Jones 1995 ).  The aim of the questionnaire is to measure how much a 
patient’s skin problem has affected the patient o ver a recall period of the past week.  To complete 
the questionnaire, patients need to provide responses to 10 questions (the questions focus on 
domains such as symptoms feelings associated with disease, the impact of the disease on leisure, 
school or holi days, personal relationships, sleep, and side effects of treatment for the skin 
disease.  The instrument has a recall period of 7 days. Nine of the 10 questions are scored as 
follows:  
 Very much = 3  
 Quite a lot = 2  
 Only a little = 1  
 Not at all = 0  
 Quest ion unanswered  = 0  
Question 7 has an additional possible response (prevented school), which is assigned a score

[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient Oriented Eczema Measure  
The POEM is a 7 -item,  validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to 
assess disease symptoms in children and adults (Charman 2004 ).  The format is a response to 
7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding , and weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) based on 
frequency of these disease symptoms during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 
2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score 
reflects disease -related morbidity.  
The questionnaire will be administered at time points according to Section  8.1.  This 
questionnaire asks the caregiver to report their perception of p atient’s AD symptoms.  It is 
therefore completed by [CONTACT_18629].  To ensure consistency in perception over longitudinal 
administration and to minimize respondent variability, it is important that the same caregiver 
complete the questionnaire at each time  point.  This should be communicated to caregivers 
during consent and prior to the first completion of the questionnaire.  A field has been added to 
the first page of the diary/questionnaire to indicate who completed the questionnaire 
(mother/female guardi an, father/male guardian, other caregiver).  This information will be 
transcribed into the eCRF along with the questionnaire.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Faces Pain Scale – Revised  
The Faces Pain Scale – Revised (FPS -R) is a self -report measure of pain intensity developed for 
children (Hicks 2001 ). It was adapted from the Faces Pain Scale t o make it possible to score the 
sensation of pain on the widely accepted 0 to 10 metric. The scale shows a close linear 
relationship with visual analog pain scales across the age range of 4 to 16 years. It is easy to 
administer and requires no equipment ex cept for the photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_98248]. The instrument has well 
established psychometric properties and has been validated in school -going children.  
The instrument will be used to assess injection site pain at the time points specified in 
Section  8.1.  This instrument measures concept(s), which are known only/best to the person who 
is administered the injection.  As such the instrument is designed for self-report.  Where possible 
the patient should read the instructions and complete the instrument alone.  Where required a 
caregiver (parent or other) can read the instructions aloud to the person with AD.  However, it is 
important that the person with AD’ s selected response is entered directly into the instrument.  
The caregiver must not influence or question the response given by [CONTACT_892918].  This 
should be communicated to caregivers during the first visit.  A field to indicate whether the 
instruc tions were read out to the patient by [CONTACT_892919]/questionnaire.  This information will be transferred to the eCRF.  
The assessment tools are provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  PROMIS Anxiety and Depression S cale 
The PROMIS Anxiety instrument measures self -reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious 
misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness), and somatic symptoms 
related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness). The PROMIS Depression instrument assesses 
self-reported negative mood (sadness, guilt), views of self (self -criticism, worthlessness), and 
social cognition (loneliness, interpersonal alienation), as well as decreased positive affect and 
engagement (loss of interest, meaning, an d purpose).  
Both of these assessments need to be completed at the time points specified in Section  8.1.  This 
questionnaire asks the caregiver to re port their perception of the patient’s anxiety and depressive 
symptoms.  It is therefore completed by [CONTACT_18629].  To ensure consistency in perception over 
longitudinal administration and to minimize respondent variability, it is important that the same

time points accor ding to Section  8.1. 
The IGA is provided in the study reference manual and in Appendix  2.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eczema Area and Severity Index  
The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity 
and extent of AD (Hanifin 2001 ).  The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 
72.  Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], 
scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_892920] a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe).  In addition, the area of 
AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by [CONTACT_12904], trunk, upper limbs, and 
lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6.  In each body region, the  area is expressed as 0, 
1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 
100%).  The EASI will be collected at time points according to Section  8.1. 
NOTE:  Each of the body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs) is assigned a 
proportion of the total body surface area.  These proportions vary with age and are different in 
young children as co mpared to older children.  
The EASI assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Global Individual Signs Score  
Individual components of the AD lesions (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and 
lichenification) will be rated global ly (ie, each assessed for the whole body, not by [CONTACT_197500]) on a 4 -point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  The Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) will be assessed at time points 
according to Section  8.1. 
The GISS assessment tool  is provided in the study reference manual.

 CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  SCORing Atopic Dermatitis  
The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) is a validated tool used in clinical research and 
clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of 
AD (European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis 1993 ).  There are 3 components to the 
assessment: A = extent or affected BSA, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms.  The extent 
of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body  area (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and reported 
as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD 
calculation) .  The severity of 6  specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, 
excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, and dryness) is assessed using the following scale: 
none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total p oints, assigned as “B” 
in the overall SCORAD calculation).  Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded 
for each symptom by [CONTACT_12906] a Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 is no itch (or 
sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_1250619] imagin able itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible 
score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation.  The 
SCORAD is calculated as:  A/5  + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103.  Patients will undergo 
this assessment at time p oints according to Section  8.1. 
The SCORAD assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual.

Thymus and activation -regula ted chemokine and total serum IgE are markers of type 2/Th2 
activity as downstream mediators in the IL -4/IL-[ADDRESS_1250624] (Wirnsberger 2006 , 
[COMPANY_005] 1997 ). These analytes may be assessed as measures of type 2/Th2 activity and PD effect 
of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. The results may be used for modeling dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892871]. Thymus and activation -regulated chemokine levels have also 
been closely associated with AD diseas e activity and severity (Beck 2014 ), and will be evaluated 
as an exploratory marker of efficacy. These markers may also be assessed for their potential 
value in predicting treatment response.  
Lactate dehydrogenase levels have also b een shown to correlate with disease severity and 
activity in patients with AD ( Mukai 1990 ).

(EC) all unanticipated problems involving risks to patient. This includes death from any cause 
and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to 
the IRB/EC, regardless of assessed causality.  
9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected  serious 
adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]), to the health authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate, and to the 
investigators.  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol will be 
considered as unexpected. Any worsening of or new onset of symptoms related to AD, which 
occur during the screening/washout period prior to study drug administration will be considered 
expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are expected and at 
least reas onably related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorit ies and IECs/IRB as appropriate.

uninten ded sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  – includes all deaths, even th ose that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident  in which a patient  is a passenger).  
 Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not includ e an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] . 
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24927] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_892873] t han 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24929], or is 
prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_101831].  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient  or 
may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events. See Section  9.3.3  for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.  
                                        VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1250627] (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the sponsor’s  product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid communication by [CONTACT_35348]. Such an event might 
warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature 
of the ev ent, rapid communication by [CONTACT_50459] (eg, regulators) might also 
be warranted ( Section 9.4.3 ). 
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study. Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be 
followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is pro vided in Section  9.4.[ADDRESS_1250628] be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1250629] (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC) all unanticipated problems involving risks to patient s. This includes death from any cause 
and all SAEs related to the use of the study drug. It is recommended that all  SAEs be reported to 
the IRB/EC, regardless of assessed causality.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient  completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
 SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study/early termination v isit - the 
SAE will be reported to the sponsor. The investigator should make every effort to 
obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic 
and/or stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/e arly termination 
visit - only fatal SAEs and those deemed by [CONTACT_50460] -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor. The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:   Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), by [CONTACT_16470] [ADDRESS_1250630] dose of study drug. Any complication of pregnancy 
affecting a female study patient and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE 
criteria must be reported as an SAE.   Outcome for all pregnancies should be 
reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Even ts of Special Interest:  Adverse events of special interest (AESI) must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_1250631] for this study 
include:  
 Systemic or extensive hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic 
react ions 
 Malignancy  
 Helminthic infections  
 Suicide -related events  
 Conjunctivitis (any type or etiology), keratitis , or blepharitis (only events 
that are either severe or serious will be reported as AESIs ) 
Any patient who experiences an adverse event of special interest related to an eye disorder will 
be referred to an ophthalmologist.  Futher evaluation of these AESIs will be performed including 
any additional tests, as per the discretion of the ophthalmologist.   
Refer to the study reference manual for the proc edures to be followed.  
9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient ’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.  
Refer to the study reference manual for the pr ocedures to be followed.  
                                        VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_1250632] finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, a nd/or  
 the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/ surgical  intervention, 
and/or  
 the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional conc omitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_101881], although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the abse nce of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale 
outlin ed in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event information will be collected until the  patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
 Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal functioning 
level. It may be an annoyance. P rescription drugs are not ordinarily  needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient . 
 Moderate:  Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health. 
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment. Treatment  for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:  Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health. Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE , its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -
colon indicates “or” within description of  grade:  
 Mild :  Pain that does not interfere  with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5  cm of 
erythema or induration that does not interfere with activity  
 Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24  hours or 
interferes  with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with activity  
 Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily 
activity; significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily 
activity ; requires ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis  
9.5.2.  Evalua tion of Causality  
Relationship of AEs to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_093], and will be a clinical 
decision based on all available information. The following question will be addressed:  
Is there a reason able possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]?  
The possible answers are:  
Not Related:  There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_104245]:  There is a reasonable possibility that the event m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_197512] a list of factors to consider in assessing the relationship of AEs to study drug, see 
Appendix  1. 
The spon sor will request information to justify the causality assessment of SAEs, as needed.  
9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patients at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion. The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the compound. The study monitor will be supported by [CONTACT_31599] (eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data 
Management). Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review 
of SAEs) and on  a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the 
Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the bas is for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to 
make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the 
planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for each dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24771]:  
H0: No treatment difference between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24765]  
H1: There is a treatment difference between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_197456] (<30 kg and ≥30 k g) and region (North America/Europe) will be the 
2 stratification factors for patient randomization and will be accounted for in the statistical 
modeling for efficacy.  
10.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Based on the initial sample size of 240 patients (prior to this amendment) , it is estimated that 
with 80 patients per group, at the 2 -sided 5% significance level, the study will have:  
 97% power to detect a difference of 23% between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W treatment and 
placebo treatment (both in combination with TCS) in the  percentage of patients who 
achieve an IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 28% and 
5% for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W and placebo, respectively  
 87% power to detect a difference of 17% between dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W treatment and 
placebo treatment (both  in combination with TCS) in the percentage of patients who 
achieve an IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 22% and 
5% for dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg Q4W and placebo, respectively  
 99% power to detect a difference of 51% in the percentages o f patients achieving 
EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 68% and 17% for 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W and placebo, respectively, (both in combination with TCS)  
 99% power to detect a difference of 45% in percentages of patients achieving 
EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 62% and 17%  for 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W and placebo, respectively, (both in combination with TCS)

 CONFIDENTIAL  The significance level is set to 2 -sided, 0.05 level. The assumptions used for the power 
calculations were estim ated based on results from the R668 -AD-1224 study (phase  3 
combination study for adult AD patients) and R668 -AD-1021 study (a phase 2b dose -ranging 
study in adults with AD) for patients with IGA=[ADDRESS_1250633] disease for a shorter duration than 
adults and the disease is more Th2 driven in acute phase whil e it becomes more type 1 helper 
T cell in chronic phase (Thepen 1996 , Gittler 2012 ). In addition, children with AD in general 
respond better to systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_892874] (Schmitt 2007 ). A recent study compared the 
differences between activated and polarized T -cell subsets in blood of adult and pediatric 
patients with AD. The study found that AD is Th2 dominated in children while it extends to 
additional helper T cell subsets, parti cularly Th22, in adults (Czarnowicki 2015 ). The sample 
size calculations were done using nQuery (7.0).  
Due to an inadvertent operational error, [ADDRESS_1250634] been  unbli nding are not included in the protocol but will be described 
in the clinical study report.  An additional approximately 90 patients will be added to the study to 
ensure that the original number of blinded patients for all treatment groups  is available  for 
sensitivity analyses that exclude the potentially unblinded patients. This will maintain study 
balance and power.  
The total sample size of the study will be up to approximately 330 patients (110 patients per 
group) , and approximately 262 patients (80 , 91 and 91 in Q2W, Q4W, and placebo group, 
respectively) if excluding the potentially unblinded patients.  With the sample size of 
330 patients or 262 patients, the power for the co -primary endpoints will be greater than 90%.  
10.3. Analysis Sets  
10.3.1.  Efficacy Analys is Sets  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses will be based on 
the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized).  All efficacy variables will be 
evaluated in the FAS, which will be considered to be the prim ary analysis set . 
The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes all randomized patients but excludes potentially 
unblinded patients. The primary endpoint, co -primary endpoint, and selected secondary 
endpoints will be evaluated in the mFAS as sensitivity a nalyses . 
The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patients in the FAS except for those who are excluded 
because of major protocol violations. A  preliminary list of potential  major protocol violation s is 
provided  in Appendix  [ADDRESS_1250635] will be generated prior to database lock . The PPS will 
also exclude potentially unblinded patients.  
The primary and co -primary endpoint s will also be evaluated in the PPS.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized patients  who received any study drug; it is 
based on the treatment received (as treated). Treatment compliance/administration and all 
clinical safety variables will be an alyzed using the SAF.  
10.3.3.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sets  
The PK analysis set includes all randomized patients who received any study drug and who had 
at least [ADDRESS_1250636] 1 non -missing ADA result (either “ADA negative” or “ADA positive”) after the first dose 
of study drug.  
10.4. Patient Disposition  
The following  will be provided:  
 The total number of screened patient s: met the inclusion criteria regarding the target 
indication and signed the ICF  
 The total number of randomized patient s: received a randomization number  
 The total number of patient s in each analysis set 
 The total number of patient s who discontinued the study, and the reasons for 
discontinuation  
 The total number of patients potentially unblinded  
 A listing of patient s treated but not randomized, patients randomized but not treated 
and patient s randomize d but not treated as randomized  
 A listing of patient s prematurely discontinued from treatment, along with reasons for 
discontinuation  
 A listing of potentially unblinded patients  
10.5. Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will incl ude the following: the number of patients  
reflected in the calculation (n), mean, standard deviation, median, first quartile (Q1), third 
quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum.  
For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for  each category.  
All data will be summarized by 3 treatment groups (ie, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q2W dose, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] Q4W 
dose, and placebo). All placebo patients will be pooled for analysis regardless of whether it is 
100 mg placebo, 200 mg placebo, or 300 mg placebo.

Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  
10.5.2.  Efficacy Analyses  
For each dose regimen and all efficacy variables, the analysis will be comparisons of each of the 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892875] (Q2W and Q4W combined).  
A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints will be 
performed in the mFAS . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by [CONTACT_68485] (baseline weight group and 
region) will be used for analyzing the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 or 
percentage of patients with EASI -75 at week 16.  The Mantel -Fleiss (MF) criterion will be 
checked, and if it is not met, sensitivity analyses including each stratification factor separately in 
CMH test will be conducted.  
All efficacy data regardless if the patient is on the study treatment or discontinues the study 
treatment but remains in the study will be used for ana lysis. Specifically, if a patient stays in the 
study until the end of the planned placebo -controlled treatment period, all efficacy data collected 
up to the planned end of treatment visit will be included in the primary analysis regardless if the 
patient i s on treatment or not.  
To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: For the primary efficacy 
endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if rescue treatment is used (see Section  7.3), the 
patient will be specified as a nonresponder from the time the rescue is used.  
If a patient withdraws from study, this patient will be counted as a nonresponder for endpoints 
after withdrawal.  
Sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to determine 
patient’s status at week 16 will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy 
analysis with regards to handling of missing data. The e fficacy data will be set to missing after 
rescue treatment is used, then the LOCF method will be used to determine patients’ status at 
week  16.  
In addition, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted by [CONTACT_173855]. A patient with missing data 
will be counted as a non -responder. Other sensitivity analyses may be conducted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use th e same approach as that used for 
the primary analysis.  
For continuous endpoints:  
 The multiple imputation (MI) with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be 
used as the primary analysis method.  Patients’ efficacy data through week [ADDRESS_1250637], and then be imputed by [CONTACT_892925].  Missing data from the FAS will be imputed 40 times to 
generate 40 complete datasets by [CONTACT_892926] 2 steps 
below:  
 Step 1: The m onotone missing pattern is induced by [CONTACT_892927] 
(MCMC) method in MI procedure using seed number [ZIP_CODE].  
 Step 2: The missing data at subsequent visits will be imputed using the regression 
method for the monotone pattern with seed number [ZIP_CODE]  and adjustment for 
covariates including treatment groups, randomization strata (baseline weight 
group and region), and relevant baseline.  
 The week 16 data of each of the 40 complete datasets will be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model  with treatment, randomization strata 
(baseline weight group and region), and relevant baseline included in the model, and 
the SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences 
by [CONTACT_31571] 40 analyses using Rub in’s formula.  
 If a patient receives rescue treatment, the efficacy data collected after rescue 
treatment is initiated will be treated as missing. All efficacy data will be used for 
analysis regardless of whether the patient is on study treatment or discon tinues the 
study treatment but remains in the study.  
 In addition to the MI method described above, sensitivity analyses such as ANCOVA 
model with LOCF, MI method with ANCOVA model on all observed data regardless 
of rescue use will be conducted. Additional details on sensitivity analyses will be 
provided in the SAP.  
Time to event endpoint will be analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan -
Meier curves will also be provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Multiplicity Considerations  
A hierarchical procedure will be used to c ontrol the overall Type -1 error rate at 0.05 for the 
primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints across the 2 dupi[INVESTIGATOR_892876]. 
The abbreviated, preliminary plan for  hierarchical testing order for the primary endpoint and key 
secondary e ndpoints is shown in Table  3.  The complete hierarchy including all the secondary 
endpoints will be provided in the SAP.

 CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
Definitions  
For safety variables, 2 observation periods are defined:  
 The pretreatment period is defined as the time from signing the ICF to before the first 
dose of study drug.  
 The treatment -emergent period is defined as the day from first dose of study drug to 
end of study. The treatment -emergent period includes the 16 -week treatment period 
and follow -up period.  
 Treatment period:  date of the first dose of study drug to week 16 visit date (study 
day [ADDRESS_1250640] dose of study drug if week 16 visit date is 
unavailable) or early termination date, whichever comes first.  
 Follow -up period:  date after week 16 visit date (study day [ADDRESS_1250641] 
dose of study drug if week 16 visit da te is unavailable) to end of study.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as those that are not present at baseline or 
represent the exacerbation of a preexisting condition during the on -treatment period.  
Analysis

The following a nalysis and data conventions will be followed:  
Definition of baseline:  
 The baseline assessment will be the latest, valid pre -first-dose assessment available  
General rules for handling missing data:  
 If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is i ncomplete or missing, it will 
be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an 
incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to 
treatment. If the partial date indicates the same mont h or year of the intake of study 
medication date, then the start date by [CONTACT_161481], otherwise, the missing day or month by [CONTACT_474851].  
 No imputations for missing laboratory data,  ECG data, vital sign data, or physical 
examination data will be made.  
Unscheduled assessments:  
 Extra assessments (laboratory data or vital signs associated with nonprotocol clinical 
visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will b e included in 
listings, but not summaries. If more than [ADDRESS_1250644] observation will be used in summaries and all observations will be 
presented in listings.  
10.7. Statistical Considerations Surrounding the Premat ure Termination 
of a Study  
If the study is terminated prematurely, only those parameters required for the development 
program and/or reporting to regulatory authorities will be summarized. Investigator and sponsor 
responsibilities surrounding the premature  termination of a study are presented in Section  16.1.

documentation of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to 
the study site.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by [CONTACT_427]) to obtain 
written informed assent from each patient and written informed consent from each patient’s  
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) prior to the patient’s participation in the study and after th e aims, 
methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to fullest possible 
extent in language that the patient (if applicable) and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can 
understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_11346]’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) 
and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF, and the IAF be signed and dated 
by [CONTACT_102] (if applicable) and the same investigator or designee who explained the IAF.  
Local law must be observed in dec iding whether 1 or both parents/guardians consent is required. 
If only [ADDRESS_1250647] document the reason 
the other parent or guardian did not sign. The patient may also be required to sign and date the 
ICF or a separate IAF, as determined by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and in accordance with the local regulations 
and requirements.  
 Patient s/parents or legal guardians who can write but cannot read will have the 
assent/consent form read to them before writing their name [INVESTIGATOR_2394] t he form.  
 Patient s/parents or legal guardians who can understand but who can neither write nor 
read will have the ICF read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign 
and date the IAF/ICF to confirm that informed consent was given.  
The origin al IAF/ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_31616] 's study record, 
and a copy of the signed IAF/ICF must be given to the patient/patient’s parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the r isk/benefit assessment, the 
ICF/IAF must be reviewed and updated appropriately. All study patient s and their parent(s) or 
legal guardian(s) must be informed of the new information and provide their written assent (if 
applicable) or consent if they wish the patient  to continue in the study. The original signed 
revised ICF/IAF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to 
the patient/patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
14.3. Patient  Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient  will be maintained. Patient s should be identified by [CONTACT_56706] a patient  
identification number, only, on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor. Documents 
that will not be submitted to the sponsor (eg, signed ICF/IAF) must be kept in strict confidence.

Investigator’s Decision  
The investigator must notify the sponsor of a desire to close -out a site in writing, providing at 
least 30 days’ notice. The final decision should be made through mutual agreement with the 
sponsor. Both parties will arrange the close -out procedures after review and consult ation.  
Sponsor’s Decision  
The sponsor will notify the investigator(s) of a decision to close -out a study site in writing. 
Reasons may include the following, among others:  
 The investigator has received all items and information necessary to perform the 
study, but has not enrolled any patient  within a reasonable period of time  
 The investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, 
including but not limited to, breach of this protocol (and any applicable amendments), 
breach of the ap plicable laws and regulations, or breach of any applicable ICH 
guidelines  
 The total number of patient s required for the study are enrolled earlier than expected

contraceptive measures include stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen 
containing) hormonal contraception (oral, vaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only 
hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inh ibition of 
ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device 
(IUD); intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; 
vasectomized partner; and or sexual abstinence**.  
* For the purpose of this stud y, any female who has had her first menstrual period 
(menarche) and is sexually active will be considered to be of childbearing 
potential. Female patients who are not of childbearing potential at the start of the 
study but have the onset of menarche during  the course of the study and are 
sexually active will also have to follow adequate birth control methods to continue 
participation in the study.  
** Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual i ntercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the patient.  
NOTE:  Peri odic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.

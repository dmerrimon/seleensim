1.0 Introduction and Background  
Rhinitis is a condition in which the membrane lining the nasal cavity becomes irritated 
and swollen. Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_143082], runny nose, 
sneezing, nasal itching, irritated throat , and postnasal discharge. The 2 major 
class ifications of rhinitis are allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR). AR  
may be caused by [CONTACT_143105], pet dander, mold , or dust . NAR may result 
from trigge rs that includ e chemicals, irritants, and medications.[ADDRESS_162744] a patient’s quality of life by [CONTACT_143106], 
headache, and sleep disturbance, resulting in cognitive impairment and diminished 
productivity , and thereby [CONTACT_143107] a personal and financial burden.[ADDRESS_162745] or foreign substances that enter the nasal passage. Mucus is  cleared by 
[CONTACT_143108].4 Regulation of the seromucous 
glands and mucosal blood supply occurs through parasympathetic and adrenergic 
stimulation via the vidian nerve, posterior nasal nerves and other nerves. In some 
situations, the mucosa may become hy perresponsive to stimuli and produce excess 
mucus, resulting in rhinorrhea or postnasal discharge.  
Patients presenting with runny or congested nose, watery eyes, irritated throat , and/or 
sneezing symptoms are evaluated to understand the types of triggers t hat may prompt 
the symptoms experienced. Understanding the patient’s r espi[INVESTIGATOR_143083].2,5,[ADDRESS_162746] common methods to determine allergy sensitivity are percutaneous skin testing 
and the allergen -specif ic immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody testing. These tests can 
identify allergens the patient should avoid. However, if an allergic cause is eliminated 
through this testing, a diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis could be made.1,2 
Treatment to reduce symptoms may include nasal irrigation (nasal lavage)  multiple 
times a day with a saline rinse, use of over -the-counter oral or nasal antihistamines 
and/or corticosteroid sprays, and allergen immunotherapy in AR patients. Patients with 
nonallergic rhinitis are less likely to respond to oral antihistamines, b ut may find their 
symptoms relieved with intranasal antihistamine, corticosteroid , or anticholinergic 
sprays. Patients whose symptoms are not adequately relieved with conservative 
treatment often  seek treatment  to alleviate symptoms and may be candidates f or nasal

surgery. Vidian neurectomy is a surgical option to relieve chronic rhinitis  symptoms as 
the vidian nerve supplies autonomic input to the nasal mucosa (as well as the palate 
and the lacrimal gland). While this surgery has been performed for over 50  years, it is 
controversial since access to the nerve can be  technically difficult and complications 
with numerous surrounding important structures can occur.7,8 Common procedural side 
effects include dry eyes, nasal dryness or crusting and mild pain . More significant risks 
may include hemorrhage, vision loss and palate/lip/cheek numbness. In addition, 
improvement in symptoms is often unpredictable.7 An alternative neurectomy target is 
the posterior nasal nerve (PNN). The advantage of the PNN over the vidian nerve is its 
more limited innervation and activity on the nasal mucosa and its physical distance 
from other major nerve structures. As a result,  complications associated with PNN 
surgery are less significant and occur less frequently than those described for vidian 
neurectomy,7 while still pr oviding significant improvement in quality of life.9 A recent 
development is use of a cryosurgical probe to ablate PNN  tissue.10 Significant 
improvement from baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) using this 
cryosurgical probe was observed.  
Radiofre quency (RF) energy has been used for decades in the fields of 
otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery, cardiology, urology and general surgery. ENT 
surgeons currently use radiofrequency energy in numerous nasal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including  
radiofrequency turbinate reduc tion (RFTR), which is a minimally invasive surgical 
option that can reduce tissue volume in a precise, targeted manner. There have been 
multiple studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of using radiofrequency energy in 
the RFTR  procedure.[ADDRESS_162747] also demonstrated that radiofrequency tissue therapy in the nasal passage can be 
safe and effective in improving nasal obstruction and in preserving nasal function.12 
Aerin Medical’s rad iofrequency system using the Vivaer® ARC Stylus has been 
investigated and shown effective in treatment of nasal airway obstruction .13 
Aerin Medical previously conducted a small feasibility study (TP220) using the Aerin 
Medical radiofrequency system to trea t subjects with chronic rhinitis. The InSeca® 
Stylus was used to apply radiofrequency energy to the inferior turbinate  in the PNN 
area. At [ADDRESS_162748]  procedure, 73% of subjects showed improvement in their Sino -
Nasal Outcomes (SNOT -22) score. There were no device -related or procedure -related 
serious adverse events.  
The feasibility study was followed by  a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study 
(TP668) with 50 participants that supported regulatory clearance of the RhinAer Stylus  
for treating rhinitis  by [CONTACT_143109] . The mean reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score 
(rTNSS) at baseline was 8.5 (SD 1.8) and improved to 3.4 (SD 2.3) at the 12 -week 
primary endpoint ( 5.1-point or 59.2% improvement). The responder percent  for at least 
a 1-point improvement in rTNSS at 12 weeks was 94%. Responder percent,  based on 
at least 2-, 3- (~30%) , and 4 -point improvements in rTNSS were  92%, 88%, and 69% . 
Patient  reported satisfaction with the procedure and quality of life improvement were 
high. No serious adverse events related to the device were observed and the limited 
number of adverse events possibly associated with the procedure or device were

Patients  diagnosed with chronic rhinitis  and meeting all eligibility criteria may be 
enrolled in the study.  
4.4 Outcome Measures  
4.4.1 Nasal Assessment  
The target PNN  area within each nostril will be visually assessed at baseline 
(pretreatment), immediately following the treatment procedure , and at 3 -month  
evalu ation . The use of an endoscope for visual assessment is required. 
Observations are categorized as not present, mild, moderate, or severe. 
Representative still photographs or video of each nostril will be captured at each 
visit.  
Assessments include:  
• Significant dry eye  (yes/no)  
• Bruising around orbital area  
• Soreness, pain  
• Numbness  
  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL

Endoscop e required : 
• Inflammation / generalized redness  
• Swelling, edema  
• Bleeding at anesthetic injection site (not requiring physician 
intervention)  
• Bleeding at treatment site (not requiring physician intervention)  
• Nasal obstruction from tissue edema  
• Disruption of mucosal flow / crusting . 
4.4.2 Pain – Visual Analog Scale Pain Score  
A horizontal 100 mm VAS14 anchored on the left with the words “No Pain” and 
on the right with the words “Worst Pain Imaginable ”, will be used to measure 
nasal pain associated with the procedure.  Scores are obtained by [CONTACT_143114] (0) to the point indicated 
with a slash placed by [CONTACT_143115].  
4.4.3 Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)  
The TNSS is an instrument used to collect patient self -rated severity of nasal 
symptoms originally comprised of  3 symptoms (nasal obstruction, 
itching/sneezing and secretion/runny nose)15 that has been widely adapted to 
include 4 nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea , nasal congestion, nasal itching, and 
sneezing . The FDA has cited the TNSS  as a preferred measure of efficacy in 
trials of drug treatments for allergic rhinitis16 and nonallergic rhinitis.17 The 
TNSS requires the patient  to rate 4 nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal 
congestion, nasal itching and sneezing) on the following 4 -point scale:  
• 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom is evident)  
• 1 = mild symptom s (sign/symptom present, but minimal awareness; 
easily tolerated)  
• 2 = moderate sympt oms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is 
bothersome but tolerable)  
• 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes 
interference with activities of daily living and/or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).  
The total score is the sum of the [ADDRESS_162756] severe symptoms.  
The minim al clinically important difference (MCID) for change in mean TNSS 
derived from anchor -based methodologies has been shown to be 0.23 - 0.28 
units and by [CONTACT_143116] -based methodol ogy the MCID was determined to be 
0.59 units.18 A less rigorous expert panel -based estimate of the MCID was 30% 
of the maximum score of 12, which is 3.6 units.19 The evidence -based

 [ADDRESS_162757] been recommended to supersede the panel -based 
meth od.20,21 
The 24-hour reflective TNSS (rTNSS)  will be used in this study. Participants 
will be asked to self-evaluate their symptom severity over the preceding 24 
hours.   
Treatment Responder  based on rTNSS improvement  
Individual participant success (responder) is defined as at least 30% 
improvement (decrease) in the rTNSS from baseline . 
4.4.4 Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire ( Mini RQLQ ) 
The R hinoconjuctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire  is a well -established, 
validated, and the most frequently used rhinoconjuctivitis disease -specific 
instrument .22 The original RQLQ consisted of 28 questions across 7 domains 
and included ratings of 3 activities selected by  [CONTACT_102].23 The validated 
standardized version (RQLQ(S)) uses standardized activity questions, which 
facilitates ease of administration .24 The MiniRQLQ, to be used in this study, 
was developed and validated to further facilitate ease of use and efficiency  by 
[CONTACT_143117] 14.25 The RQLQ(S) and the Mini RQLQ 
were found to be the best tests with optimal discriminant validity and  
responsiveness  for measurement of health -related quality of lif e in AR 
patients .[ADDRESS_162758] occurred in AR patients, the MiniRQLQ has also been 
validated for NAR patients.27 
The instrument consists of 14 questions across 5 domains (activity limitations 
(n=3) , practical problems (n=2), nose symptoms (n=3), eye symptoms  (n=3) , 
and other symptoms (n=3 )). Responses are based on a 1 -week recall and 
provided on a 7-point scale : 
• 0 = not troubled  
• 1 = hardly troubled at all  
• 2 = somewhat troubled  
• 3 = moderately troubled  
• 4 = quite a bit troubled  
• 5 = very troubled  
• 6 = extremely troubled.  
The total or overall Mini RQLQ score is the mean of the 14 responses and the 
domain scores are the mean of the questions in each domain.  
The generally accepted MCID for th e overall RQLQ (S) and each individual 
domain is 0.522,24,28,29 and has also been reported as ≥ 0.62 .30 The developers of 
the RQLQ instruments reported that the MCID for the MiniRQLQ was slightly 
  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL  
 22 of 56 
higher (0.7) than for the RQLQ(S).25 Another study using a combination of both 
anchor -based and distribution -based methods determined the MCID for the 
MiniRQLQ to be 0.42 ( 95% confidence interval 0.30 - 0.51).31 
4.4.5 Participant Satisfaction  
Satisfaction with the procedure is measured with a f ive-question self -reported 
survey using a 5-point scale to assess tolerability of the procedure, ease of 
recovery, change in  drainage /rhin orrhea/runny nose symptoms , overall 
satisfaction with the procedure , and recommendation to others  
4.4.6 Other Rhinitis Symptoms - Cough and Postnasal Drip  
Self-reported assessment of c urrent problems with cough and postnasal drip or 
excess mucous in the throat rated on the same 4 -point scale used for symptoms 
comprising the rTNSS:  
• 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom is evident)  
• 1 = mild symptom s (sign/symptom present, but minimal awareness; 
easily tolerated)  
• 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is 
bothersome but tolerable)  
• 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes 
interference with activities of daily living and/or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).  
4.4.7 Change in Amount of PRN Medication/ Device Use for Chronic Rhinitis  
Symptoms  
Self-reported assessment of an increase or decrease from baseline in as needed 
medications and/or devices used for treatment of nasal symptoms following the 
procedure.   
4.4.8 Medication  and Other Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143086] , devices , or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143087] , medication name, frequency, and dose will be recorded at each 
evaluation visit. Medications may be categorized for reporting purposes.  
4.4.9 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be documented according to  Section 7.1. 
4.5 Success /Failure Criteria  
Determinations of the successfulness of the treatment will be made on 2 levels : the 
individual participant  level and in terms of the overall change in mean rTNSS  from 
baseline to 3 months after the procedure.

Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL  
 23 of 56 
4.51 Participant  Succes s 
The success measure for individual participant success (responder) is defined 
as at least 30% improvement (decrease) in the rTNSS from baseline  at the 3 -
month primary endpoint . 
4.5.2 Participant  Failure  
A participant  will be considered a nonresponder at the 3-month  evaluation  if 
the success criterion has not been attained.  
4.5.3 Study Success  
The study will be considered a success if the mean change from baseline of the 
rTNSS at 3 months significantly exceeds the MCID set for the study.  
4.6 Duration of the Study  
The primary outcome will be evaluated at 3 months . In addition , evaluations at 6, 12, 
24, and 36 months after treatment will extend  follow -up to 3 years for evaluation of 
longer -term efficacy. Enrollment is anticipated to be completed within 6 months. 
Therefore, total study duration is anticipated to be approximately 42 months.  
4.7 Site Staffing and Responsibilities of Study Personnel  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_114083] h e/she has sufficient and 
qualified staff to conduct the clinical study  and that all study -related tasks have been 
appropriately delegated and documented.  
The treating physician  will perform the procedure and discharge  and [ADDRESS_162759] with 
study participants to ensure collection of study data and participant reported 
outcomes .  
4.8 Device  Description  
The Rhin Aer procedur e incorporates use of the Rhin Aer Stylus  (Model  FG815 ), 
which is a cleared ( FDA - K192471 ) disposable handheld device capable of 
delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue . RhinAer has CE Marking  in EU . 
The Aerin Console  (Model FG226)  RF generator with temperature control capable 
of delivering very low doses of energy  was cleared  for use in the US (FDA - 
K162810 ) and has CE Marking in the EU  (CE639608 )  
The Rhin Aer Stylus  (Figure 1)  consists of a handle, shaft  and treatment tip. An array 
of bipolar electrodes is positioned on a nonconductive tip  (Figure 2) that is attached 
to the handle via a nonconductive shaft. A temperature sensor is located on the Stylus 
tip to monitor tissue temperature  during RF energy de livery . The Stylus is powered 
by [CONTACT_143118] -controlled radiofrequency generator  via a flexible cable  
(Figure 3 ). The Stylus incorporates features to allow compatibility with and 
  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL  
 24 of 56 
authentication by [CONTACT_143119]. The connector for the Rhin Aer Stylus has 
a pin configuration that prevents its use with other RF generators, making it only 
compatible with the Aerin Console. Authentication of the Stylus is achieved via a 
crypto chip that is built into the Stylu s handle assembly. The chip is read and written 
to by [CONTACT_143120]. Information stored on the chip includes the Stylus model 
information, default treatment parameters (Power 4W, Temperature 60  °C, Duration 
12s, Cooling Time 0s), custom treatment setti ng ranges (Power 3 -5W, Temperature 
50-70°C, Duration 10 -18s, Cooling 9 -12s), usage timestamp data, and a count of the 
remaining treatment cycles (based upon pre -set maximum).  
The RhinAer  Stylus is temporarily inserted into the nose to access the treated area. 
The Stylus requires the application of conductive media to the treatment tip prior to 
use. The conductive media helps to ensure good contact [CONTACT_143121]. Application of the RF energy is 
controlled by a foot switch connected to the Console. The RhinAer Stylus treats 
symptoms of chronic rhinitis by [CONTACT_143122] s. 
The low -power radiofrequency energy generates heat within the submucosal tissue, 
destroying local tissue, mucous cells, and glands, and creating a coagulation lesion. 
This destruction of tissue in PNN  regions improves symptoms of chronic rhinitis.  
The procedure requires local anesthesia only. The Stylus is manufactured and 
supplied sterile and for single use only  by [CONTACT_143123].

4.9 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
4.9.1 Risks  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Rhin Aer Stylus do not differ from 
commonly used devices and treatments for chronic rhinitis , but due to the 
nonsurgical nature of the therapy, small treatment area, low energy delivery , 

  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL

and lack of need for ge neral anesthesia, the overall risk to the participant may 
be less than presented by [CONTACT_143124] . 
Potential risks associated with the use of the Rhin Aer Stylus and the associated 
local anesthetics are listed  below. Participants  will be monitored closely as part 
of this study to allow for early detection of potential problems and prompt  
treatment if required . 
Adverse events or side effects that may occur as a result of the treatment  
include : 
• External deformity  
• Blanching (generali zed whiteness)  
• Bruising including around the orbital area (black eyes)  
• Infection  
• Bleeding (other than during the treatment at treatment sites and greater 
than anticipated by [CONTACT_093])  
• Mucosal changes  
• Scar formation leading to nasal obstruction  
• Sensory changes at treatment site  
• Dry eye  
• Vasovagal response secondary to the procedure  
Anticipated observations that are expected in and around the treatment area and 
are considered minor  include:  
• Inflammation / generalized redness  
• Temporary s welling, edema  
• Temporary numbness/tingling  
• Temporary soreness/pain  
• Mild bleeding at anesthetic injection and/or treatment site (not requiring 
physician -level intervention, such as cautery)  
• Temporary nasal obstruction from tissue edema  
• Disruption of mucosal  flow/intranasal crusting  
• Scab formation . 
These observations will be assessed in the nasal assessment and recorded at 
study visits if they occur. Should any of the following require mitigation by [CONTACT_143125] o f incidence than

The Mini RQLQ  will be completed by [CONTACT_143132] . 
5.4 Treatment Visit and Procedure  
If the participant meets eligibility criteria and signs the IRB /EC approved informed 
consent t he participant is considered enrolled .  
The treatment procedure is summarized below. Consult the Rhin Aer Stylus and Aerin 
Console  Instructions for Use ( IFUs) for full detail of the treatment procedure  and 
step-by-step instructions for preparation and use of the Rhin Aer Stylus and Aerin 
Console . 
Preparation   
The procedure will be performed in the study clinic.  The participant  will be in a 
reclined or supi[INVESTIGATOR_143089] . A visual phys ical and endoscopic 
nasal assessment will be conducted just prior to the procedure and documented on 
the appropriate CRF.  The study physician will map out the treatment area by 
[CONTACT_143133]. Participants  
will have both PNN  areas  treated in a single study procedure session. Each nostril 
will be treated at up to 5 nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_143090] r portion of the 
middle meatus and posterior portion of the inferior turbinate  (Figure 4) .

Figure 4.  RhinAer Stylus in the nose.  
The physician will anesthetize the treatment area by [CONTACT_2329] a topi[INVESTIGATOR_143091]/gauze or 
spray  of lidocaine to numb the mucosal tissue , wait a minimum of [ADDRESS_162766] anesthesia to the treatment area after  initial numbness has occurred.  
Treatment administration  
An endoscope will be inserted into the nasal cavity so the physician can visualize the  
mucosal area of treatment. The Rhin Aer Stylus will then be inserted to access the 
treatment  area.  The Stylus will be connected to the Aerin Console generator and the 
RF energy level will be set on the  generator.  
The default settings for the RhinAer  Stylus  will be used for the study:   
Temperature   60 °C 
Power    [ADDRESS_162767] when energy is 
being delivered until the treatment is complete. After the treatment time is reached, 
the Aerin Console will cease to delivery energy an d reset for subsequent treatments .  
No repeat ("touch -up") procedures will be perm itted during the study  follow -up 
period.  
Procedure data collection  
Data relating to the procedure and the products  used will be recorded on the 
Procedure CRF . The following information will be recorded:  
• Date of procedure  

  CTP1056  Rev C

• Preprocedure  nasal assessment (each nostril) including photos or video 
(physical and endoscopic)  
• Preprocedure and procedure medications  
• Rhin Aer Stylus  and Aerin Console  information  
• Aerin Console settings  
• Procedure start and end times 
• Number of sites treated  
• Occurrence of device malfunction, protocol deviation, or adverse events . 
5.5 Postprocedure Assessments and Care  
An endoscopic  nasal assessment will  be conducted prior to discharging the 
participant  and reported on the Procedure  CRF . 
Participants will be asked to indicate  the pain level experienced during the study 
procedure from anesthesia delivery to procedure completion using the VAS pain 
score instrument (vertical line marked on the 100 mm line)  on the Pain VAS CRF . 
At the discreti on of the physician, the following care may be provided:  
• Apply compression to the treatment area internally for 5 minutes.  
• Apply petroleum jelly to the treatment area as needed.  
• Use of nasal saline spray or ointment as needed . 
• The participant  should be in structed not to blow their nose  for [ADDRESS_162768] their 3-month  follow -up visit (13 weeks) scheduled within 
the visit window  prior to release . 
Participants  should not generally receive other concomitant nasal treatment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_143092] -up period to avoid 
confounding the evaluation of the effect of the treatment , unless the additional care 
is in respons e to an adverse event or is considered in the best interest of the 
participant . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], interventions, and pain medication will be monitored at 
follow -up evaluations.    
5.6 Follow -up Evaluations  
Follow -up visit dates will be calculated from the study procedure date. Follow -up 
visits should be scheduled within the specified visit windows described in Section 
5.1 and Table 1 (Section 8.3.2 ). The office follow -up evaluation  occurs at 13 weeks 
after the procedure.  Evaluations at 6, 12, 24,  and 36 months  will be conducted 
remotely by [CONTACT_143134] . The timing of all follow -up 
evaluations  is based on the date of the procedure and should not be altered b ased on 
the actual time of preceding follow -up visits. Participants  who make  nonstudy  visits 
should be evaluated for possible adverse events and an Adverse Event CRF should 
be submitted if appropriate .

All participants  should be followed through the final evaluation visit at 3 years  
postprocedure regardless of their success/failure classification  at previous 
evaluations . Every effort should be made to avoid having participants  withdraw from 
the study (Section  9.5). If a participant  does choose to withdraw f rom the study , it is 
very important to record information regarding the reason(s) and the last known status 
of the participant . 
The following assessments will be conducted as indicated for each follow -up time 
point and recorded on the corresponding  CRF s: 
Office evaluation  at 13-week (3-month ) follow -up 
• Nasal assessment (each nostril) including photos or video

the sponsor  or disposed of in accordance with the sponsor’s instructions . The 
investigator is responsible for adequate record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_143095], use , and 
final disposition  of study  inventory.  
6.0 Statistical Considerations  
6.1 Study Design  
This is a prospective, multicenter, open -label, single -arm study to assess  the 
performance of the Rhin Aer procedure for treatment of chronic rhinitis . The study is 
designed to assess improvement in rTNSS and other measures from baseline 
condition to 3 months after the procedure, as well as for extended follow -up through 
3 years.  
6.2 Study Hypothes is 
The primary endpoint of the study is change in mean rTNSS  from baseline to the 1 3-
week evaluation.  Improvement in the rTNSS is represented by a decrease from 
baseline in the 12 -point score.  
An MCID of 1 unit, or 2 to 4 times the more rigorously derived MCIDs, was set for 
this study.  The hypothesis is that the i mprovement (decrease) in rTNSS mean score, 
measured as change from baseline at 13 weeks (13 weeks - baseline), exceeds the 
MCID (1 unit).  
The null (H 0) and alternative (H A) hypotheses are:  
H0: µd ≥ -1 
HA: µd < -1 
where µ d = the mean change of the paired d ifferences of the 1 3-week scores minus 
the baseline scores.  
Rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative (H A) hypothesis means that 
there is evidence for a clinically  significant improvement (decrease)  in the rTNSS . 
6.[ADDRESS_162771] for change from baseline at 1 3 weeks using the following assumptions:  
• Significance level α = 0.0 25 (one -sided ) 
• Power = 90%  
• µd = 1-point decrease in mean change score = MCID  
• SD = 3 = estimated  standard deviation of the mean difference  based on an 
observed SD of 2.6 in a prior study . 
  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL  
 36 of 56 
The minimum number of subjects to achieve 90% power is 97 (G-Power, paired t -
test). Allowing for 1 5% loss (nonevaluable) and adjusting for a balanced distribution 
across 20 sites the sample size is 140 participants . It is anticipated that participant s 
will be enrolled at sites on a competitive basis; however, a  reasonable balance of 
partic ipants  among sites may be maintained by [CONTACT_143135][INVESTIGATOR_143096] s. 
6.[ADDRESS_162772] reached the 
primary endpoint at 13 weeks (3 months) postprocedure. The primary  and secondary 
endpoint s will be analyzed using the data from the primary evaluation phase for an 
interim study report  when  these data become available. Informational outcomes will 
be analyzed and include d in interim reports after all participants have reac hed each 
of the successive follow -up time points. A  final study report  will be provided after all 
participants have reached the final follow -up evaluation of the extended follow -up 
phase of the study.  
6.5 Analysis Populations  
Enrolled Population  – all subj ects enrolled in the study.  
Evaluable Population  – all subjects that are enrolled in the study and have received 
the study procedure.  
Safety Population  – all subjects enrolled in the study . 
6.[ADDRESS_162773] hoc  sensitivity analys es may be performed  if 
missin g cases exceed 10% of the sample size , including a wors t-case analysis  (all 
missing rTNSS at [ADDRESS_162774] possible score) , to further assess the effect 
of missing data on the primary analysis . The results of the sensitivity analysis will 
not be u sed to adjust the conclusions drawn from the primary analysis . 
Secondary outcome measures and additional observational measurements will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_143136].  
6.7 Pooling  
All study data will be pooled across study sites to facilitate hypothesis testing in 
accordance with the sample size estimation and power analysis (Section 6.3).  Pooling 
is generally justified because the  study will be conducted such that: 1) the same 
protocol will be used at each site; 2) site investigator s and personnel will receive 
uniform training; and 3) central data management and monitoring will be consistent 
and applied with equal rigor at all sites.  Comparability between study sites may be 
shown using summary statistics calculated by [CONTACT_3725].

Secondary endpoint s will be formally tested only after the primary objective of the 
study is met.  Confidence intervals (95%) will be included for all secondary outcome 
measures.  
• Responder  percentage at 13 weeks  
The proportion of responders will be calculated along with the 95% 
confidence interval.  Individual participant success (responder) is defined as 
at least 30% improvement (decrease) in the 24 -hour reflective Total Nasal 
Symptom Score (rTNSS ). An overall responder percent  of at least 60% is

7.[ADDRESS_162781] Complaints  
7.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment phase or during the follow -up 
phase. Adverse events occurring after the baseline assessment but before the 
treatment procedure will be documented in the particip ant’s medical record but will 
not count as related to the study device or procedure.   
7.1.1 Definitions  
Following are definitions associated with adverse events:  
Adverse Event (AE)  - any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical sign or symptom (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), in subjects users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device and whether ant icipated or unanticipated (ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]).  
Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  -  an adverse event that led to any of the following 
(ISO 1415 5): 
a) Death,  
b) Serious deterioration in the health of the subject, users or other persons 
as defined by [CONTACT_10980]:  
1) a life -threating illness or injury, or  
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function 
including chronic disease, or  
3) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function,  
c) fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality, or birth defect 
including physical or mental impairment  
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -exiting condition, or a proc edure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not 
considered a serious adverse event.  
  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL  
 [ADDRESS_162782] (ADE)  - Adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.  
Note: This definition includes advers e events resulting from insuffic ient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This 
definition also includes any event resulting from use error or fro m intentional 
misuse of the investigational medical device (ISO [ZIP_CODE]).  
Serious  Adverse D evice  Effect (SADE)  - an adverse device effect that has 
resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event 
(ISO 1415 5) 
Unanticipated (Seriou s) Adverse Device Effect (UADE  or [LOCATION_003]DE ) - any 
serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity,  or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects  (21 CFR 812.3 (s)). 
Relationship to device and procedure  
The potential relationship of the event to the device or procedure:  
• Not related  
An adverse event for which sufficient information exists to indicate that 
there is no causal connection between the event and the device or 
procedure. The adverse event is due to and readily explained by [CONTACT_2416] ’s underlying disease state or is due  to concomitant 
medication or therapy not related to the use of the device or the 
procedure. In addition , the adverse event may not follow a reasonable 
temporal sequence following the procedure.  
• Unlikely  
The relationship with the use of the device or proce dure seems not 
relevant and/or the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained.  
• Possibly related  
There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been 
primarily caused by [CONTACT_143139].  The adverse event has a 
reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the 
procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
device or procedure, but alternative etiology is equally or more likely 
compared to th e potential relationship to the use of the device  or the 
procedure.  
  CTP1056  Rev C 
Clinical Study Protocol  – RELIEF Study   
 
RhinAer RELIEF single arm protocol Rev C Final 27JAN2021 CONFIDENTIAL  
 42 of 56 
• Probably related  
There is a reasonable probability that the adverse event may have been 
primarily caused by [CONTACT_41491]. The adverse event has a 
reasonable temporal relationshi p to the use of the device or the 
procedure and follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
device or procedure.  
• Definitely related  
The adverse event has a strong causal relationship to the device or 
procedure. The adverse event follows a strong te mporal relationship to 
the use of the device  or the procedure, follows a known response pattern 
to the device  or procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_143140] ’s clinical state or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Every effort sho uld be made to determine the cause of each adverse event, 
because a judgment must be made as to the relationship to the device or 
procedure. If an investigator cannot assign a causality category the event will 
be considered possibly related for reporting a nd analysis.  
NOTE: The occurrence of a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre -
existing condition, unless the condition becomes more severe or increases in 
frequency, would not be considered procedure -related  or device -related.  
Intensity of adverse events :  
• Mild  
The adverse event is noticeable to the participant  but does not interfere 
with routine activity.  
• Moderate  
The adverse event interferes with routine activity but responds to 
symptomatic therapy or rest.  
• Severe  
The adverse event significantly limits the participant 's ability to perform 
routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]. The adverse event 
requires medical or surgical treatment or results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

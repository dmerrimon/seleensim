Study Sites: Multiple sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Study Population: Approximately 720 healthy adult male or nonpregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old who meet all eligibility criteria 
Rationale: The main purpose of this study is to assess the ability of H5 influenza 
virus vaccines and adjuvants presen t in the National Pre-Pandemic 
Influenza Vaccine Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] (NPI[CONTACT_385363]) to generate an immune response 
to homologous and to antigenically distant heterologous H5 influenza 
virus strains.  
The study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 
vaccination strategies with homol ogous or antigenically distant 
heterologous H5 influenza virus vaccines administered with AS03 or 
MF59
 adjuvant. 
Objectives: Primary:  
Safety: 
• To assess the safety and reactoge nicity for 8 days postvaccination, 
inclusive of the vaccination day (Day 1 through Day 8 and Day 22 
through Day 29), of a 2-dose vacc ination series using homologous 
monovalent inactivated H5 in fluenza virus vaccine or 
antigenically distant heterologous  H5 influenza virus vaccines 
administered intramuscularly (IM ) with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant 
on Days 1 and 22 (henceforth referred to as “prime-boost”), as determined by [CONTACT_830828] a nd systemic reactogenicity 
symptoms.

• To assess the safety and reactoge nicity for 8 days postvaccination, 
inclusive of the vaccination day (Day 1 through Day 8, Day 22 
through Day 29, and Day 142 through Day 149), of a 3-dose vaccination series using homologous monovalent inactivated H5 influenza virus vaccine admini stered IM with AS03 or MF59 
adjuvant on Days [ADDRESS_1153311] dose 120 days after the 
second dose with an antigenically heterologous H5 influenza virus 
vaccine administered IM with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant on Day 142 
(henceforth referred to as “prime -prime-boost”), as determined by 
[CONTACT_830829]. 
Immunogenicity: 
• To assess the serum hemagglutin ation inhibiti on (HAI) antibody 
seroprotection rate (SPR) against strains contained in the study 
vaccines on Day [ADDRESS_1153312] vaccination series 
administered IM with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant on Days 1 and 22. 
• To assess the serum HAI antibody SPR against strains contained in the study vaccines on Day [ADDRESS_1153313] vaccination series administered IM with AS03 or MF59 adjuvant 
on Days 1, 22, and 142. 
 Secondary: 
Safety:  
• To assess the occurrence of serious adverse events, medically 
attended adverse events (MAAEs), and potentially 
immune-mediated medical conditions (PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279]; see Appendix 2, 
Section 12.2 ) in the [ADDRESS_1153314] dose of study vaccine.  
• To assess the occurrence of unso licited adverse events for 21 days 
after each dose of study vaccine.

rates (SCRs) against each vaccine  strain in the study through 
Day [ADDRESS_1153315] vaccination series.  
• To assess the serum HAI antibody titers, SPRs, and SCRs against 
each vaccine strain in the study through Day [ADDRESS_1153316] vaccination series.  
• To assess the serum microneutrali zation (MN) antibody titers and 
SCRs against each vaccine strain  in the study through Day [ADDRESS_1153317] vaccination series. 
• To assess the serum MN antibody titers and SCRs against each 
vaccine strain in the study through Day [ADDRESS_1153318] vaccination series.

hemagglutinin (HA) clades since 1997, and liv e-bird market surveillance identified novel 
clade [IP_ADDRESS] reassortant viruses of different subtypes in Asia since 2009, including H5N2, 
H5N3, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8 strains ( Gu et al 2011 ; Zhao et al 2012 ; Zhao
 et al 2013 ; Hill 
et al 2015 ; Wong et al 2015; World Health Organization 2017a ). Some of these clade [IP_ADDRESS] 
viruses have begun to spread internationally to Asia (H5N 6), Europe, Africa, and North 
America (H5N8). After the first detection of the Eurasian H5N8  in the Pacific Northwest of 
the [LOCATION_002] in December 2014, the resu lting reassortant H5N2  viruses spread to 
21 states by [CONTACT_11713] 2015 aff ecting 48 million poultry ( [LOCATION_002] Department of Agriculture 
2016). No human cases of H5N8 were detected; however, there have been 
16 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N6 (clade [IP_ADDRESS]) reported in China since 2014, including 9 fatalities ( World Health Organization 2017b).  
While the risk of human infection with H5 influe nza viruses is low, the Department of Health 
and Human Services continuously monitors the risk  and prepares to res pond to the threat of 
novel influenza virus outbreak s in the [LOCATION_002]. In order to prepare and respond 
effectively to future influenza pandemic thr eats, the Biomedical Advanced Research and 
Development Authority (BARDA) within th e Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Preparedness and Response, has establishe d and maintains the National Pre-Pandemic 
Influenza Vaccine Stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] (NPI[CONTACT_385363]) that comprises bulk adjuvants, pre-pandemic antigens, and final containers of vaccines that were ma nufactured from candidate vaccine viruses from 
representative clades of H5 influenza viru ses (eg, clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3). These candidate 
vaccine viruses are carefully chosen based on ongoing surveillance of influenza A viruses 
circulating in animals and assessment of  associated potential pandemic risk. 
In the case of a declared pandemic emergency, the vaccine exactly matching the antigenic 
properties of the pandemic virus will not be available until several m onths later. Production 
issues, such as virus and purific ation yields that vary dependi ng on the virus characteristics,

used for prime and boost vaccinations) may be superior to homologous prime and boost 
vaccination regimens (ie, the same HA antig ens used for prime and boost vaccinations) in 
generating cross-reactive immune responses to  antigenically diverg ent influenza viruses 
(Belshe et al [ADDRESS_1153335] et al 2014, Leroux-Roels et 
al 2010, Levine et al 2017 ). Furthermore, there is some  evidence suggesting that when 
compared to a homologous prime-boost vaccin ation regimen, a heterologous prime-boost 
vaccination regimen including adjuvant ma y broaden and enhance cross-reactive 
hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody respons es to a panel of antigenically divergent 
H5 influenza viruses (Levine et al 2017 , unpublished data). 
Influenza virus vaccines induce antibodies agai nst the viral HA antigen in the vaccine, 
thereby [CONTACT_830833][INVESTIGATOR_790793]. In some human 
challenge studies of other influenza viruses,  antibody titers of at least 1:[ADDRESS_1153336] been 
associated with protection from influen za infection in up to 50% of subjects.

A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai Lake/1A/2005 (H5N 1) vaccines contain 30 mcg/mL HA from 
SJRG-161052, Indo5/PR8-RG2, and SJRG-163222 candida te vaccine viruses respectively, in 
sodium phosphate buffered isotonic saline. Th ese monovalent vaccines also contain gelatin 
(0.05%), trace amounts of formaldehyde ( ≤200 mcg/mL), polyethylene glycol 
p-isooctylphenyl ether ( ≤0.05%), and sucrose ( ≤2.0%). In addition, thimerosal at a

Seqirus (formerly bioCSL) A/gyrfalcon/Washington/[ZIP_CODE]-6/2014 (H5N8) vaccine contains 
30 mcg/mL HA from IDCDC-RG 43A candidate vaccine virus in isotonic phosphate buffer. 
Each 0.5 mL vial of monovalent vaccine may also contain trace amounts of sodium

The adjuvant MF59® is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene and a buffer; the 
emulsion is stabilized by [CONTACT_1121] 2 emulsifiers (a water-soluble surfactant 
[polysorbate 80, also known as Tween® 80] and an oil-soluble surf actant [sorbitan trioleate, 
also known as Span® 85]). Biodegradable squalene oil is  a natural metabolite of cholesterol 
and a normal component of cell membranes. MF 59 enhances immune responses to antigen 
by [CONTACT_24096] 3 different cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. 
MF59 has a range of effects on these cells, in cluding increased antigen uptake, release of 
chemoattractants, and inducti on of cell differentiation ( FLUAD [Influenza Vaccine, 
Adjuvanted] 2016 ).  
MF59 has been developed to enhance the immunogenicity of purified subunit antigens, has 
been tested in several animal models in comb ination with different antigens, and has been 
evaluated in humans ( Schultze et al 2008). MF59 was the first adjuvant for human use to be 
licensed after alum and, as part of an enhanced seasonal trivalent inactivated subunit influenza vaccine (FLUAD
®) for the elderly, is now licensed in more than 30 countries 
worldwide. MF59 is also the adjuvant of Eu ropean Union-licensed monovalent A(H1N1) 
swine influenza subunit egg- derived vaccine (FOCETRIA®), a cell-derived pandemic 
vaccine (CELTURA®), and licensed pre-pandemic vaccine (AFLUNOV®). 
Warnings and precautions for the influen za virus vaccines include history of a 
hypersensitivity reaction to chicken or egg protei ns or life-threatening reactions to previous 
influenza vaccinations. Immunoc ompromised persons may have a reduced immune response 
to influenza virus vaccines. The most common ( ≥10%) adverse reactions observed with the 
vaccines used in this study are pain at in jection site, tenderness, headache, malaise, 
induration/swelling, redness, itching, myal gia, arthralgia, shivering, and sweating.  
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153337] 1 dose of influenza virus 
vaccines combined with MF59 adjuvant in comple ted clinical studies. The completed studies 
showed that the MF59 adjuvant significantly improved the immunogenicity of inactivated 
subunit influenza virus vaccines, with a clinic ally acceptable increase in the incidence of 
injection site reactions ( Schultze et al 2008 ). According to an integrated safety analysis, filed 
in the BB-Master File for MF59, there was an in creased risk of solicited local and systemic 
reactions in subjects exposed to MF59, while there was a similar or decreased risk of all 
unsolicited adverse events (AEs), autoimm une diseases, new onset chronic diseases, 
cardiovascular disease, serious adverse events  (SAEs), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and deaths when 
compared with non-MF59-adjvuanted vaccines ( Pellegrini et al 2009 ).  
The AS03 adjuvant is composed of squalene, DL- α-tocopherol, and polysorbate 80. AS03 is 
approved for human use as the adjuvant component of the Influenza H5N1 Virus Monovalent 
Vaccine, Adjuvanted ( Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Monovalent Vaccine 2013 ).  
Other influenza vaccines containing AS03 adj uvant were administered outside the United 
States during the Influenza A 2009 (H1N1) pa ndemic. The following AEs were identified: 
anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, febrile convulsions, Guillain-Barre syndrome, narcolepsy, somnolence, paresthesia, angioedema, generalized skin reactions, urticaria, and injection site 
reactions (including inflammati on, mass, necrosis, and ulcer) ( Influenza A (H5N1) Virus 
Monovalent Vaccine 2013).  
Both the AS03 and MF59-adjuvanted vaccines have  been licensed in the [LOCATION_002] (eg, 
AS03 in the Influenza A [H5N1] Viru s Monovalent Vaccine, Adjuvanted [ Influenza A 
(H5N1) Virus Monovalent Vaccine 2013] and MF59 in the FLUAD vaccine [ FLUAD 
(Influenza Vaccine, Adjuvanted) 2016 ]). There are no major safety concerns associated with 
the use of these adjuvants; however, there is  epi[INVESTIGATOR_830796] 03 and narcolepsy. In studies of influenza 
A(H1N1) vaccine adjuvanted with AS03, there wa s a small increased risk of narcolepsy in 
subjects who received adjuvanted vaccine ; however, narcolepsy developed almost 
exclusively in the pediatric population vaccinated with influe nza A(H1N1) adjuvanted with

Page 25 AS03 (Pandemrix®, GlaxoSmithKline, Wavre, Belgium, produced in Dresden, [LOCATION_013]) and 
primarily in Scandinavian countries ( Lind et al 2014 , Nohynek et al 2012 ). A small study to 
assess the risk of narcolepsy following administ ration of a similar vaccine adjuvanted with 
AS03 (Arepanrix®, GlaxoSmithKline, Wavre, Belgium, produced in Quebec City, Canada) 
was performed in Quebec, Canada ( Montplaisir et al 2014 ). The Canadian study showed a 
small risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_830797]03-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 
vaccine manufactured in Quebec. This risk occu rred primarily in people less than 20 years of 
age and was much less than that seen in some European countries. An additional study was 
conducted in the [LOCATION_002], which found that influenza vaccines containing the 
A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain were not associated  with an increased risk of narcolepsy ( Duffy 
et al 2014 ). Finally, the “SOMNIA study” conducted by [CONTACT_830836] 
A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines. Comparison of incidence rates of narcolepsy before, during, and after the use of adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 in fluenza vaccines provided no evidence outside 
of the signaling country Sweden ( Shimabukuro  et al 2017). 
This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 2 st udy to assess the safety and immunogenicity 
of a homologous or heterologous vaccination seri es with inactivated monovalent influenza 
H5 vaccines stored in the NPI[CONTACT_385363], administered  intramuscularly (IM) with either AS03 or 
MF59 adjuvant in healthy males and nonpregnant females, aged [ADDRESS_1153338] dose of adjuvanted vaccine 120 days following the 
second dose will utilize HA an tigens from the NPI[CONTACT_385363].  
The study is designed to further inform opti ons for strategic deployment of pre-pandemic 
influenza vaccines stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_830798]. In particular, we will determine whether 1) the 
antigenic characteristics of [ADDRESS_1153339] and 2) the sequence in which 
the priming and boosting antigens are administered are important for optimal elicitation of 
immune responses to the vaccine. The antigens included in this study were carefully chosen 
based on the relative antigenic distance between  the HAs of pre-pandemic vaccine strains 
and relative to the currently ci rculating H5 influenza viruses.  Furthermore, this study will 
address serologic responses to the vaccination regimens when ad ministered with each of the 
adjuvants (AS03 or MF59) held in the NPI[INVESTIGATOR_830799] (A S03 or MF59) in a single-dose 
or a 2-dose priming series.

influenza H5, such as longer interval prime-boost studies. 
No formal independent data monitoring comm ittee (IDMC) meetings are planned for this 
study. The IDMC will meet only if a pausing rule is met.  Two interim analyses are planned based on cumu lative immunogenicity and safety data after 
all subjects complete Day 43 and all subjec ts complete Day 163. At each time point, the 
study database will be monitored, cleaned, and fro zen through the data cut time point. Safety 
and immunogenicity data will be summarized by [CONTACT_2060]. Interim analysis results will be 
unblinded at the group level, and each group will  be assigned a fake name. Results will be 
provided to the sponsor with groups iden tified only by [CONTACT_830840].  
A single clinical study report (CSR ) will be written with unblinded data at the subject level 
after Groups E, F, K, L have completed Day 262. Additional safety resu lts from the time of 
CSR database freeze until the end-of-study vi sit for all groups will be included in an 
addendum to the final CSR. 
3.1.1 Rationale of Study Design  
The main purpose of this study is to assess the ability of H5 influenza vaccines and adjuvants 
present in the NPI[INVESTIGATOR_830800] H5 influenza virus strains.  
The study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination strategies 
with homologous or antigenically distant heterologous H5 influenza virus vaccines

3.1.3 Study Pausing Rules 
Study pausing rules will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_7195]. The 
sponsor will pause study enrollment and study vaccine administration and the IDMC will 
review unblinded safety data if any of the following are met: 
• Occurrence of one or more SA E(s), MAAE(s), or PI[INVESTIGATOR_106286](s) j udged to be related to IP; 
OR 
• Any potentially life-th reatening AE judged to be related to IP (An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered “ life threatening” if, in the view  of either the investigator 
or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at imme diate risk of death. It does 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reacti on that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death); OR 
• A death, if judged to be related to IP; OR 
• Anaphylaxis or bronchospasm with in 4 hours of injection judged to be related to IP; OR 
• 10% of vaccinated subjects at a given v accination time point when at least 50% of 
subjects in that group have been vaccinated experience the same or similar systemic or 
local Grade 3 (toxicity scoring) or higher event; OR 
• A pattern of significant symptoms, physical findings, or laboratory abnormalities that, 
although individually minor, collectively represen t a safety concern in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_639827].

3. Serious or intolerable AE(s) that in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_830802].  
4. A serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
elevation that is Grade 2 (moderate) or greater based on FDA toxicity grading (ie, 
≥2.6 × upper limit of normal [ULN]; see Appendix 3, Section 12.3 ) that does not 
resolve on repeat testing to the screening baseline value (eg, baseline toxicity score). (Note, subjects with elevated ALT and/or  AST values cannot be revaccinated until 
resolution occurs [see Section 4.3].) 
5. Other laboratory safety assessments that reveal Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1153358] to follow-up. 
8. Other (eg, pregnancy, development of contraindications to use of IP). 
9. The subject withdraws consent or the investigator or BA RDA decides to discontinue 
the subject’s participation in the study. 
In addition, Study Pausing Rules ( Section 3.1.3 ) will be monitored throughout the study by 
[CONTACT_7195].  
The investigator will also w ithdraw all subjects if BARD A terminates the study. Upon 
occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the investigator will confer with BARDA. If a 
subject is discontinued from the study or study treatment because of an AE, the event will be 
followed until it is resolved or becomes stable . Any subject may withdr aw his or her consent 
at any time.

Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153360] withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal shall be 
recorded by [CONTACT_21719] (eCRF).  
Whenever possible, all subjects who discontinue from the stu dy prematurely will undergo all 
early termination assessments ( Table 12–1  and Table 12–2 ). Subjects who discontinue study 
treatment prematurely will be encouraged to attend subsequent visits according to the 
protocol. Subjects who fail to return for final as sessments will be contact[CONTACT_830842]. A subject will not be considered lost to 
follow-up until every attempt to contact [CONTACT_433974], at minimum 
2 (documented) phone calls, followed by a register ed letter. Every effort should be made to 
collect safety data on subjects through the end-of-study visit. 
It is vital to obtain follow-up data on any subject withdrawn from the study or study 
treatment (ie, no longer receiving IP) because of an AE or SAE. In every case, efforts must 
be made to undertake protocol-speci fied safety follow-up procedures. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1153361] will be randomly assigned to treatment vi a interactive response 
technology (IRT). A unique randomization num ber will be assigned to the replacement 
subject. If a subject is withdr awn from the study after receipt of  the first dose of IP, this 
subject will not be replaced.

Page 40 5 Study Groups 
5.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 12 study groups stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. An IRT will be 
used to administer the randomization schedule centrally. Biostatistic s will generate the 
randomization schedule using SAS® software Version 9.3 or later (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, 
North Carolina) for IRT, which will link se quential subject randomization numbers to 
treatment codes. The randomization schedule w ill be created by [CONTACT_830843], stored in a separate project area, and will be blinded to the project team. 
5.[ADDRESS_1153364] will be blinded. Two doses of  adjuvanted vaccine separated 
by 21 days (Groups A-D, G-J) or [ADDRESS_1153365] dose of adjuvanted vaccine 120 days following the second dose 
(Groups E, F, K, L), which include HA antigen from the NPI[CONTACT_385363], will be administered IM 
according to Table 3–1 .  
The study vaccines will be prepared by [CONTACT_44647] H5 influenza virus vaccine antigen with either 
AS03 or MF59 adjuvant prior to administration. The study vaccine (0.5 mL) should be 
administered by [CONTACT_830844] [ADDRESS_1153366] will be packaged and labelled according to applicable local and 
regulatory requirements. Each kit will contai n a (randomized) dosage for [ADDRESS_1153367] and will 
contain a sufficient quantity for dispensing for 1- time usage. Single-use vials will be labelled 
with a single panel label. Each kit will al so be labelled with a single panel label.

5.3.[ADDRESS_1153369] be promptly reported to the SAE hotline ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). In case of any AEs 
associated with the overdose, these should be reported on rele vant AE/SAE sections in the 
eCRF. Any overdose should be reco rded as a protocol violation and promptly reported to the 
sponsor. No overdoses are expected as the vaccine and adjuvant will be administered by 
[CONTACT_464]. 
5.4.1 Treatment of Overdose 
Treatment of overdose would include supportive and symptomatic care, according to the standards of care at the site. The investigator should promptly notify the medical monitor 
about the overdose and seek his/her input  on the medical management, as needed. 
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153370] firewall between the blinded 
and unblinded teams will be maintained. 
For the 2 planned interim analyses, BARDA, s ite personnel, and subj ects will be unblinded 
for all interim data at Day 43 and Day 163 onl y at the study group level (ie, data will be 
provided with each group having a fake designation). For the final analysis, all parties will be 
unblinded to all data at the subject level at Day 142 (Groups A-D, G-J) and Day 262 
(Groups E, F, K, L).  
With the exception of the unblinded study staf f who administer the IP and a separate 
unblinded monitor who will monitor IP accountab ility, all other study staff are to remain 
blinded until CSR database freeze and a formal  unblinding is scheduled. The members of the 
IDMC will review subject level unblinded safety  data on an ad hoc basis for any immediate 
concerns that are observed. A separate unblinded team will handle any ad hoc production of 
unblinded tables, listings, and figures for ad hoc IDMC meetings. Blinded individuals will 
not be made aware of any unblinded data provided to the IDMC. 
5.5.1 Breaking the Blind 
The blind should not be broken. As needed to  meet regulatory reporting requirements, 
designated pharmacovigilance personnel may be unblinded to treatment status of individual 
subjects. In this circumstance, and if ther e are no other concerns, neither BARDA nor the 
study staff (except the unblinded study staff member who prepares and administers the 
vaccine) will be unblinded to treatment status. In  all cases where the blind is broken, the date, 
reason for code breaking, and the name [CONTACT_830881]. Subjects whose study group assi gnment is unblinded will not receive any 
subsequent IP.

The IP will be administered by [CONTACT_830845], and date, time, and location 
(left or right arm) of administration will be  recorded in the subjects’ eCRF. Subject 
compliance will be determined by [CONTACT_830846]. Any deviations from the dosing schedule outside the 
defined visit windows ( Table 12–1 and Table 12–2 ) will be flagged in the clinical database.

medications taken up to 14 days prior to Visi t 1 (Day 1), and vaccines received 12 months 
prior to Visit 1 (Day 1) will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The minimum requirement is 
that drug name, dose, frequency, route of admi nistration, and the dates of administration are 
to be recorded. This will in clude all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, 
and over-the-counter medications. Any changes, additions, and/or deletions in concomitant 
medications and vaccinations also will be re corded in the subject’s eCRF throughout the 
course of the subject’s pa rticipation in the study. 
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the welfare of the subject during the 
study may be given at the discretion of the invest igator. However, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that details regard ing the medication are recorded in full in the 
eCRF. 
Sites may contact [CONTACT_830847]. If it is di scovered that a subject is using a prohibited 
concomitant medication after he or she is enroll ed in the study, the site should contact [CONTACT_830848] e situation. All instances of use of prohibited concomitant 
medications must be documented in the eCRF. All vaccinations obtaine d outside of the study 
itself will be recorded while the subject is enrolled. 
5.7.1 Prohibited Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Immunosuppression as a result of  an underlying illness or treatment or the use of anticancer 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) w ithin the preceding 36 months prior to Day 1

the ICF. The schedule of events is shown in  Table 12–1  and Table 12–[ADDRESS_1153375] ory (including prior a nd concomitant medical 
conditions/procedures, drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, as well as current use of herbal 
supplements and multivitamins) will be collected at screening and updated at Visit 1. 
6.2 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will include the following: vital sign measurements, physical 
examination, clinical safety la boratory tests, and solicited local and systemic reactogenicity 
symptoms, and occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279] (see Appendix 2, Section 12.2 ), and 
SAEs. These assessments are detailed in Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.5. 
6.2.1 Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will include oral temper ature, pulse rate, and diastolic and systolic 
blood pressure (after subject is se ated for at least 5 minutes).  
6.2.2 Postvaccination Evaluation 
At Visits 1 and 4 (Groups A-D, G-J) and at Vi sits 1, 4, and 8 (Groups E, F, K, L), subjects 
will be monitored for solicited (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and unsolicited AEs, SAEs, MAAEs, PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279], and serious and suspected unexpected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) for at least 
30 minutes after vaccination. De tails regarding collecting and reporting solicited local and 
systemic reactogenicity sy mptoms are presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Diary cards will be 
distributed according to  Table 6–[ADDRESS_1153376] solicited local and systemic 
reactions. Solicited local and systemic re actogenicity will be toxicity graded. 
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153377] has been monitored fo r 30 minutes after va ccination, the following 
evaluations will be performed: 
1. Obtain 30±5-minute postvaccination vital sign measurements (oral temperature, pulse 
rate, and diastolic and systolic bl ood pressure) and toxicity grade. 
2. Complete a 30±5-minute postvaccination in jection site examination for solicited 
reactogenicity (local and systemic) and toxicity grade (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). If a visible 
injection-site abnormality is observed, document with a photographa. 
a  Photographs will be taken by [CONTACT_830849] (not expected with usual 
vaccine administration) for accurate description and evaluation of the findings and safety reviews. There 
are no digital format requirements; the photographs will not be stored in the study database and will not 
be used as part of the safety analysis. Photographs will be shared with the medi cal monitor, sponsor, and 
IDMC in a secure and blinded manner without exposing personal identification information (including tattoos). Subjects will be asked to provide inform ed consent requesting their permission to take a 
photograph of the finding for the purpose of medical management and safety evaluations.
 
6.2.3 Complete Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination at screening will incl ude the following: he ight (inches) and 
weight (pounds) and an assessment of skin, h ead, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, 
lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, musculoske letal system/extremities, and neurological 
system. 
A targeted physical examination will be performed as mentioned in the schedule of events 
(Table 12–1 and Table 12–2 ) and at the discretion of the inve stigator, if necessary, to evaluate 
AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities. 
6.2.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests 
Clinical safety laboratory tests will include the following according to Table 12–1 and Table 
12–2: 
• hematology: complete blood count with differential and platelet count.  
• coagulation: partial thromboplastin time and prothrom bin time (international normalized 
ratio). 
• chemistry/metabolic panel: ALT, AST, total bi lirubin, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen.

will be performed at screen ing, prior to vaccination on Days 1 and 22, and at any 
unscheduled visit (if clinically indicated) for all groups. In addition, the test will be 
performed prior to vaccination on Day 142 for Groups E, F, K, and L. 
6.2.5 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions of Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsibl e for reporting all treatment-emerg ent AEs that are observed or 
reported during the study, regardless of their relationship to IP or  their clinical significance. 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occu rrence in a subject enrolled into this study 
regardless of its causal relationship to IP. Subjects will be instru cted to contact [CONTACT_21735]. 
An SAE is defined as any event that results in any of the following: 
• Death, 
• Is immediately life threatening,  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not resu lt in death, be life th reatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_830804], based upon appropriate  medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such me dical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive trea tment in an emergency room or at home, a 
blood dyscrasia or convulsion th at does not result in inpa tient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Medically attended AEs are defined as AEs with medically attended visits, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
emergency room, urgent care clinic, or other vi sits to or from medical personnel (medical 
doctor, physician assistant, nurse practitioner) for any reason. 
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153378]. The PI[INVESTIGATOR_830805] 2, Section 12.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Solicited Local and Systemic Reactogenicity Symptoms 
All subjects will record solicited local a nd systemic reactions and other unsolicited 
symptoms/complaints, including start and stop da tes, on an 8-day diary card following each 
vaccination. The investigator or his/her design ee will review the information from the diary 
card or from memory with the subject at each visit and grade reactogenicity using a standard 
toxicity grade (Appendix 3, Section 12.3 ). The diary card will be co llected from the subjects 
and stored as a source document.  
• Solicited local reactions at the injec tion site will include erythema/redness, 
induration/swelling, and pain. 
• Solicited systemic reactions will include fever, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and chills. 
The above solicited local and sy stemic reactions w ill be recorded including start and stop 
dates, worst daily grade, any treatment requ ired, and action taken. The investigator will 
assess if solicited local and systemic reactions wi ll be considered as related to IP according to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. The severity of local and systemic reactions will be graded using the FDA 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent V olunteers Enrolled in Preventive 
Vaccine Clinical Trials ( Appendix 3, Section 12.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessing and Documenting Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be assessed from the tim e the subject receives the first vaccination 
through Day 43 for Groups A-D and G-J and through Day 163 for Groups E, F, K, L. Medically attended adverse events, PI[INVESTIGATOR_106279] ( Appendix 2, Section 12.2 ), and SAEs will be 
assessed from the time the subject receives the first vaccination until exit from the study. 
Additional details regarding el iciting and documenting local and systemic reactions are 
provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
At every study visit (except Vis it 1), subjects will be asked a standard nonleading question to 
elicit any medically related change s in their well-being. They will also be asked if they have 
been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used a ny new medications, received any vaccinations, 
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-005 Version 2.0 26 February 2018 
Page 49 or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter 
medications). 
Subjects will be provided with diary cards to  assist them in reco rding and reporting both 
unsolicited AEs and solicited local and systemic reactions  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), according to  
Table 6–1 . 
Laboratory findings that qualify as AEs and nonqualifying laboratory abnormalities outside 
the laboratory’s reference range  will be toxicity graded ac cording to the FDA Toxicity 
Grading Scale (Appendix 3, Section 12.3 ). Similarly, vital signs outside the clinic reference 
range will be graded according to the same scale. The toxicity grade for each identified 
laboratory finding and out-of-reference range v ital sign will be documented in the study 
dataset.  
The investigator will assess each Toxicity Scal e Grade 1-4 finding and determine whether the 
finding is clinically significant. Grade 1-3 clinically significant findings will be categorized 
as AEs. An FDA toxicity Grad e 2 (moderate) or greater (ie, ≥2.6 × ULN; see Appendix 3, 
Section 12.3 ) ALT and/or AST elevation (regardless of investigator-assessed clinical 
significance) will be entered into the AE reporting page. All Grade 4 findings (regardless of 
investigator-assessed clinical significance) will be  graded as AEs. Other safety assessments 
(eg, vital sign measurements), or those identif ied from review of other documents (eg, diary 
card), including those that worsen from baseline, or are felt to be  clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the inves tigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs. 
For a laboratory finding assessed as an AE (s ee above), the investig ator should report a 
medical condition rather than the name [CONTACT_830882]. For example, if the subject has a clinically significant Grade 1, 2, or 3 increased white blood 
cell count due to bronchitis, then the investigator should report the medical condition of “bronchitis” rather than “high white blood cell count.” Similarly, a clinically significant 
decreased hemoglobin should be reported as “an emia” rather than “low hemoglobin,” and a 
clinically significant de creased platelet count should be reported as “thrombocytopenia” 
rather than “low platelets.”  
Any clinically significant safety assessment that  is associated with an underlying disease 
(unless explicitly identified above ), unless judged by [CONTACT_301913]’s condition, should not be reported as an AE.

b The entire study period is from the time a subject receives th e first study injection through the end-of-study visit. If the 
investigator becomes aware of any relate d SAE or related MAAE after exit from or completion of the study, he or she 
is obligated to report this event.  
c Pregnancies that occur during a subject’s participation in the study will be followed until resolution and 2 weeks after 
live birth even if the pregnancy ends after the end-of-study visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes event term, time of onset, investigator-specified 
assessment of severity and relati onship to IP, time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any 
required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. Adverse events resulting from concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses (unless judged by [CONTACT_830850]’s underlying condition), reactions  to concurrent medica tions, or progression of 
disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution or 
stabilization. The latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities

Page 53 [IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity 
The severity of an AE refers to  the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily activities. 
All solicited AEs will be gr aded according to the FDA Toxicity Grading Scale ( Appendix 3, 
Section 12.3 ) and entered into the AE reporting page. Grade 1-3 hematology or serum 
chemistry values determined by [CONTACT_830852]. An FDA toxic ity Grade 2 (moderate) or greater (ie, ≥2.6 × ULN; 
see Appendix 3, Section 12.3 ) ALT and/or AST elevation (regardless of investigator-assessed 
clinical significance) will be entered into the AE reporting page, and the grading will be 
consistent with the FDA toxicity score. All Grade 4 laboratory findings  are considered AEs 
regardless of the investigator’s determination of clinical significan ce and should also be 
entered using the FDA toxicity score for severity . In all other cases, the severity of each AE 
will be rated as mild, moderate, or severe using the following criteria: 
Mild: An event usually transient in nature  and generally not interfering with 
normal activities. 
Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
activities. 
Severe: An AE that is incapacitating and/or prevents normal activities. 
 
Changes in the intensity of an AE should be  documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each le vel of intensity to be performe d. Adverse events characterized 
as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The 
severity of solicited AEs will be classified. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of  the relationship between an AE  and study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not  a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clin ical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. 
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-005 Version 2.0 26 February 2018 
Page 54 The relationship or association of the IP in  causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the followi ng classification and criteria: 
Unrelated: This relationship suggests that there is not a reasonable possibilitya that the AE 
is related to the IP. 
Related: This relationship suggests that there is a reasonable possibilitya that the AE is 
related to the IP. 
Note: The investigator should consider the package inse rts of all products administered in this study when 
determining causality.  
a Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessing Expectedness 
Expected AEs are AEs consistent with the applicable product information provided by [CONTACT_103] (the investigator brochures for IP). The sponsor, in consulta tion with the medical 
monitor, determines expectedness of SAEs and MAAEs. The sponsor and medical monitor 
should consider the package inserts of all products administered in this study when 
determining expectedness. If the assessment is th at the SAE or MAAE is expected, no further 
reporting is required. If the medical monitor’ s assessment is that the SAE or MAAE is 
unexpected, then the event may represent a SU SAR or expedited SAE for reporting purposes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow-Up of Subjects Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed to 
satisfactory resolution, until the investigator deem s the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, or until the subject  is considered to be stable . In the case of an abnormal 
laboratory value that is entered as an AE due to toxicity grade parameters (ie, clinically 
significant Grade 1 to 3, Grade 4 [regardless of clinical significance], and ALT and/or AST 
elevations ≥2.6 × ULN), the subject will be required to have a repeat laboratory test with 
results assessed by [CONTACT_830853] (ie, base line toxicity score) or are considered stable with a new 
baseline. Subjects may not receive revaccina tion if ALT and/or AST elevations reach ≥2 by 
[CONTACT_830854] (i e, baseline toxicity 
score) by [CONTACT_830855].

adjuvants present in the NPI[INVESTIGATOR_830809] H5 influen za virus strains. The primary outcomes will be 
descriptive in terms of whether the study vaccines are safe and immunogenic. 
7.1 Primary Endpoints 
• Safety: Occurrence of mild, moderate, or  severe solicited local and systemic 
reactogenicity symptoms during the 8 days postvaccination, inclusive of the vaccination 
day 
• Immunogenicity: SPR (defined as the proporti on of subjects achieving a serum HAI titer 
of at least 1:[ADDRESS_1153385] influenza antigen) against strains contained in the vaccines on 
Day 43 for Groups A-D and G-J and on Day 163 for Groups E, F, K, L  
7.2 Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary Safety Endpoints: 
• Occurrence of SAEs, MAAEs, and PI[INVESTIGATOR_830810] [ADDRESS_1153386] dose of study vaccine  
• Occurrence of any AEs lead ing to study withdrawal 
• Frequency and severity of unsolicited AE s for 21 days following each vaccination  
• Occurrence of clinical safety laboratory a bnormalities at all collected time points  
• Occurrence of vital si gn abnormalities at all collected time points 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints:

antibody titer of <1:[ADDRESS_1153387] 1: [ADDRESS_1153388] 1:10 and a 4-fold or greater increase of postvaccination antibody 
titer; if antibody titer is undetectable, it will be assigned a value of half the lower limit of 
detection) at all collected  postvaccination time points 
7.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
• Peripheral antibody responses to epi[INVESTIGATOR_830811] 
• Cell-mediated (eg, B cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell) responses in a subset composed of 
approximately half of enrolled subjects using PBMCs at all collected time points 
7.4 Sample Size Calculations 
Approximately 720 subjects with 60 subjects pe r study group will be enrolled in the study. 
Approximately half of enrolled subjects will be selected to provide a blood sample for PBMC 
collection. 
The number of subjects proposed to be enrolled  in this protocol is based upon previous 
experience with similar studies such as  the Mix and Match Studies (NCT [ADDRESS_1153389] 01217758) performed by [CONTACT_830857]/National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. These prior studies had study groups of similar 
size that proved to be sufficient to allow the collection of meaningful data, especially with 
respect to acute solicited AEs and antibody result s. While the current study is not designed to 
test specific hypotheses, Table 7–1 and Table 7–[ADDRESS_1153390] a range of common, immediate pos tvaccination elicited safety events as well as

Data are the property of the sponsor and ca nnot be published without  prior authorization 
from the sponsor, but data and publica tion thereof will not be unduly withheld.

Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153408] accountabi lity will be monitored by a 
separate unblinded monitor. 
10.1.1  Safety Monitoring: Responsibilities for Ensuring the Safety of 
Study Subjects 
The regulatory authority, BARDA, the instituti on where the research is performed, and all 
members of the investigator’s c linical team share res ponsibility for ensuring that participants 
in this study are exposed to the least possible risk of AEs that may result from participation in 
this protocol. 
10.1.2  Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_830812] a personal responsibility to closely monitor study subjects and 
an inherent authority to take whatever meas ures necessary to ensure their safety. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_830813], suspend, or require changes to a clinical 
study for safety concerns and may delay an individual’s study IP administration if the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_830814] a subject at 
significant risk. Where specified, responsibilit ies of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_830815] a medically qualified team member  (designee). The princi pal investigator or 
designee determines severity and causality with respect to the study IP for each AE.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1153409] safety. This 
responsibility is vested in a medical monitor and an IDMC.  
10.1.4  Medical Monitor 
The medical monitor is the sponsor’s representa tive and is a physician or surgeon in the 
[LOCATION_002]. The medical monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study 
through observation, review of study records and source documentation, monitor for study 
BARDA CSN H5 Influenza Vaccine With Either AS03 or MF59 
Protocol: BP-I-16-[ADDRESS_1153410] of the study w ith the investigator  and personnel. The 
medical monitor reviews the sa fety of the IP for protocol s in a specific region and, in 
conjunction with the sponsor, determines expe ctedness of the AE. The medical monitor, in 
consultation with the sponsor, will review  causality for SAEs/MAAEs/PI[INVESTIGATOR_830816]. The medical monitor, like the 
investigator, will be blinded for the subjects’ study group assignments.  
10.1.5  Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
The IDMC will operate according to the IDMC  Charter. The IDMC will review study 
progress and oversee clinical, safe ty, and reactogenicity data on  an ad hoc basis; the IDMC 
will meet only if a pausing rule is met. Th e IDMC will be composed of [ADDRESS_1153411] and safety oversight of  vaccine clinical stud ies. One of the IDMC 
members will serve as th e IDMC chairperson.  
The IDMC may recommend suspension or re sumption of enrollment and study vaccine 
administration after review of safety data. However, the sponsor will make the final decision 
to suspend or resume study activities. The recommendations of the IDMC, along with the 
sponsor’s decision, will be communicated to th e investigators, the IRB, and regulatory 
agency.

Protocol: BP-I-16-005 Version 2.0 26 February 2018 
Page 71 In the event of an audit, the investigator agrees to allow the sponsor, representatives of the 
sponsor, or a regulatory agency (eg, FDA) access to all study records. 
The investigator should promp tly notify the sponsor and [COMPANY_003] of any audits scheduled by [CONTACT_21767] c opi[INVESTIGATOR_21688]. 
10.[ADDRESS_1153413]’s source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a 
deviation from, or a change of, the protocol  to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
subjects without prior IRB approval. As soon as possible after such  an occurrence, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB for review and ap proval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to 
the regulatory author ities, if required. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unin tended or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures or processes approved by [CONTACT_183021]. A significant deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol by [CONTACT_21768] a signifi cant, additional risk to the subject or that may 
affect the study outcome. Significant deviations  can include nonadherence to inclusion or 
exclusion criteria or nonadhere nce to FDA regulations or ICH GCP guidelines, and may lead 
to the subject being withdrawn from the study (ie, no longer receive IP, see Section 4.2 ). 
Neither the sponsor nor designee will authorize deviations to th e study. Deviations from the 
protocol are not permitted except to protect the safety of a subject.

(end-of-study visit) fo r Groups A-D and G-J ( Table 12–1 ) and Visit 14 (end-of-study visit) 
for Groups E, F, K, and L (Table 12–2 ).  
10.4 Final Report 
Whether the study is completed or prematurely terminated, the sponsor will ensure that the 
CSRs are prepared and provided to the regulat ory agency(ies) as required by [CONTACT_40006](s). The sponsor will al so ensure that the CSRs in marketing 
applications meet the standards of the ICH harmonised tripartite guide line E3: Structure and 
content of CSRs. 
A final CSR will be written with unblinded da ta at the subject level through Day [ADDRESS_1153415] the opportunity to review the 
complete study results. 
Upon completion of the CSR, the sponsor will pr ovide the investigator with the full summary 
of the study results. The investigator is enc ouraged to share the summary results with the 
study subjects, as appropriate. The study result s will be posted on publicly  available clinical 
study registers.

Section 12.3) ALT and/or AST elevation (regar dless of investigator-assessed clinical 
significance) will be entered into the AE reporting page.  All Grade 4 findings (regardless 
of investigator-assessed clini cal significance) will be graded as AEs. Other safety 
assessments (eg, vital sign measurements), or those identified from review of other 
documents (eg, diary card), including those that  worsen from baseline, or are felt to be 
clinically significant in the medical and scien tific judgment of the investigator are to be

All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed to 
satisfactory resolution, until the investigator deem s the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, or until the subject  is considered to be stable . In the case of an abnormal 
laboratory value that is entered as an AE due to toxicity grade parameters (ie, clinically 
significant Grade 1 to 3, Grade 4 [regardless of clinical significance],  and ALT and/or AST 
elevations ≥ 2.6 × ULN) , the subject will be required to have  a repeat laboratory test with 
results assessed by [CONTACT_830878] (ie, baseline

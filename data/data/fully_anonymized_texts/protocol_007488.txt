Amendment 1
Amendment rationale 
This protocol amendment is primarily  issued for the following reasons:
1.Allowing dose escalation of secukinumab admin istered sc every 4 weeks from 75 mg 
to 150 mg or 300 mg, and from 150 mg to 300 mg
75 mg sc dose of secukinumab provides insufficient exposure:
Phase 3 studies in patients with active PsA (CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312) 
demonstrated the superior efficacy  of secukinumab 150 mg sc and 300 mg sc 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 11
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
(CAIN457F2312 only) regimens over placebo. Secukinumab [ADDRESS_165833] the 150 
and 300 mg sc doses, 75 mg sc did not provide clinically  meaningful responses in arthritic 
signs and s ymptoms, skin clearance and phy sical function :
 ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 54%, 51%, 29.3% and 15.3% with 300mg, 
150mg, 75mg and placebo respectivel y. 
 PASI 75 response rates at Week 24 were 63.4%, 48.3%, 28% and 16.3% with 300mg, 
150mg, 75mg and placebo respectivel y. 
 PASI 90 response rates at Week 24 were 48.8%, 32.8%, 12% and 9.3% with 300mg, 
150mg, 75mg and placebo respectivel y. 
 DAS -28 CRP mean change from baseline at Week 24 was -1.61, -1.58, - 1.12 and - 0.96  
with 300mg, 150mg, 75mg and placebo respectively . 
 SF36 -PCS mean change from baseline at Week 24 was 7.25, 6.39, 4.38 and 1.95 with 
300mg, 150mg, 75mg and placebo respectivel y. 
This trend from CAIN457F2312 is reflected in the week 104 results of CAIN457F2306, 
indicating that in the present longer term efficacy  extension study , ahigher dose could be
more beneficial to patients . Secukinumab 150mg had clinicall y superior ACR50 and 
PASI 75/90 response rates compared to 75mg at Week 104:
ACR50 response rates at Week 104 were 46.4 % and 35.5% with 150mg and 75mg 
respectivel y.
PASI 75 response rates at Week 104 were 82.9 % and 70.2% with 150mg and 75mg 
respectivel y.
PASI 90 response rates at Week 104 were 69.5 % and 50.0% with 150mg and 75mg 
respectivel y.
As a conclusion, there is strong evidence that the 75 mg dose administered every  4 weeks in 
PsA patients provides insufficient exposure to achieve optimal, clinically  relevant 
improvements in all subgroups and across multiple domains in this debilitating multifaceted 
chronic disease .
300 mg sc dose of secukinumab offers increased benefit for TNFα -inadequate responder 
patients and in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis:
While secukinumab [ADDRESS_165834] ylitis and enthesitis in TNF - IR patients.
Evidence of dose response was shown in TNF -IR patients favoring secukinumab 300 mg sc 
over 150 mg sc at the Week 24 efficacy  endpoint used for the primary  and secondary  efficacy 
analyses of CAIN457F2312, while the 75 mg sc dose showed overall lower efficacy . Indeed, 
ACR20/50/70 response rates at Week 24 in TNF -IR patients were higher with secukinumab 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 12
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
300 mg sc compared to 150 mg sc (45.5% vs 29.7%, 27.3% vs 18.9%% and 15.2% vs 10.8% 
respectivel y), while [ADDRESS_165835] to clear/almost 
clear skin (PASI  90, IGA mod 2011 0/1) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis ( defined 
as ≥ 10% BSA). There was a clear dose response favoring secukinumab 300 mg sc in the 
higher thresholds of skin clearance. The difference between 300 mg sc and 150 mg sc 
regimens was more pronounced in the more difficult -to-achieve PASI 90 and IGA mod 2011 
0/1 endpoints, with 21.9% and 27.4% more patients with ≥ 10% BSA compared to 8.2% and 
3.3% more patients with < 10 % BSA reaching PASI  90 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses, 
respectivel y, at Week 24. Therefore, secukinumab 300 mg sc afforded greater improvement in 
plaque psoriasis than 150 mg sc, particularly  in the achievement of clear/almost clear skin, in 
patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (≥ 10% BSA).
In addition, pertaining to safet y assessments, there were no clinicall y meaningful difference s
among the secukinumab doses of 300 mg sc, 150 mg scand 75 mg scin the exposure adjusted 
incidences rates of the key risksover theentire treatment period in the 2 phase 3 trials in PsA 
patients. The overall safet y in the PsA population was consistent with prior extensive 
experience in psoriasis, and show sthat secukinumab 300 mg sc and 150 mg sc are acceptable 
for chronic use in adult patients with active PsA.
Thus, given all the results outlined above, and in order to maintain a high proportion of 
clinically  meaningful response during the entire duration of the extension study , the dosing 
options available, at the investigator's discre tion, are:
1.The dose of secukinumab should be escalated from 75 mg sc every  4 weeks to 150 mg sc 
every  4 weeks for patients whose signs and symptoms are not fully  controlled  with 
the current dose of 75 mg, and may improve with higher dose as judged by [CONTACT_1275] .
2.Further, the dose should also be escalated to 300 mg sc every  4
 weeks for patients 
currentl y on 75 mg or 150 mg dose whose signs and sy mptoms are not fully  controlled ,
and may  improve further with an increase in dose as judged by  [CONTACT_1697].
3.Dose escalation from secukinumab 75 mg to 300 mg can be done either in one step or in 
two steps (first 150 mg then 300 mg based on investigator’s judgement) .
2. Clarification on t he duration of contraception
According to protocol exclusion criterion #4women of child -bearing potential, currentl y 
defined as all women physiologicall y capable of becoming pregnant and unwilling to use 
effective contraception during the study  and for 16weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056], should not 
be considered eligible for the study . However, there are approved secukinumab labels for the 
psoriasis indication that indicate a specific time window for the use of effective contraception 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144915].  There is currently  no evidence to indicate that a specific duration of 
post-treatment contraception is required for patient safet y. However, to align with these 
specifications in local prescribing information, protocol exclusion criterion #4is change d to 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 13

“Women of child- bearing potential (WoCBP) , defined as all women physiologicall y capable 
of becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during the 
entire study  or longer if required by [CONTACT_144935] y approved prescribing inform ation (e.g. 20 weeks 
in EU) .”
3. Data monitoring committee review no longer required
Based on the safet y results of studies CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312, the DMC review 
will no longer be required.
None of the changes described in this amended protocol are due to evidence -based safet y 
concerns.
At the time of this amendment, enrolment into the extension study  was complete with 460 
patients enrolled and 43 2patients still under treatment as of September 
6, 2015.

Protocol number CAIN457F2306E1
Title A three year extension study to evaluate the long term efficacy , safety and 
tolerability of secukinumab in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis
Brief title Extension study up to 3 years for secukinumab in psoriatic arthritis
Sponsor and Clinical 
Phase[COMPANY_001] , Phase III
Investigation type Drug / Biological
Study type Interventional
Purpose and rationale The extension study CAIN457F2306E1 is designed as a 3 -year extension 
to the phase III core study CAIN457F2306. It aims to provide continuous 
treatment with secukinumab in pre -filled s yringes (PFS) for subjects who 
completed the core study  CAIN457F2306, to obtain further long term 
efficacy , safety and tolerability information in subjects with active psoriatic 
arthritis receiving secukinumab every 4 weeks.
Primary Objective To evaluate the long -term efficacy  of secukinumab (provided as pre -filled 
syringes) w ith respect to ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response over time 
up to Week [ADDRESS_165836] to:
a.Changes in HAQ -DI relative to baseline over time up to Week 260
b.The proportion of subjects with improvements from baseline in 
HAQ -DI meeting or exceeding minimal clinically important 
difference (MCID)
c.The changes in DAS28 (utilizing hsCRP ) relative to baseline over 
time up to W eek 260
d.The proportion of subjects achieving low disease activity (DAS28 ≤ 
3.2) and disease remission as defined by [CONTACT_50999]28 (DAS28 < 2.6) 
over time up to W eek [ADDRESS_165837] 
year (up to and excluding Week 156) followed by [CONTACT_3440]- label design for 
the next two years (Week 156 onwards) . Investigators will use their clinical 
judgment to decide if it is beneficial for subjects to enter the extension 
study based upon overall improvement and response to therapy during the 
2 year period of the core study  CAIN457F2306. The total combined 
duration of treatment for the core study  and this extension study  is five 
years. At W eek 104 of the core study  CAIN457F2306, eligible subjects will 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 15
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
complete the assessments associated with the core study visit and will 
subsequently continue in the extension study  on the same dose (every  4 
weeks) that they were receiving during the core study.
Population The study population will consist of male or female subjects of at least [ADDRESS_165838] taking other concomitant biologic immunomodulating 
agent(s) except secukinumab 
2. Any subject who is deemed not to be benefiting from the study drug 
based upon lack of improvement or worsening of their sy mptoms
Investigational and 
reference therapyAll subjects will continue to receive the same dose of secukinumab they 
were receiving during the treatment period of the core study. No re -
randomization is planned. The two treatment groups are: 
Till Week 152
Group 1: secukinumab 75mg plus placebo matching high dose once 
every four weeks till W eek 152
Group 2: secukinumab 150mg plus placebo matching low dose once 
every four weeks till W eek 152
Starting with Week 156 (open label period of study )
Group 1: secukinumab 75mg once ever y four weeks till (and including) 
Week 256, or escalated to secukinumab 150mg or 300mg once ever y

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an immune -mediated chronic inflammatory  disease belonging to 
the spectrum of conditions commonly  referred to as spondy loarthritides (SpA). The scientific 
community  is split over the question whether to view these conditions together or consider 
them as separate entities (Nash 2005). For example, inflammatory  back pain associated with 
psoriasis fits
two classifications (1) AS with psoriasis or (2) psoriatic spondy litis(Gladman 
2007). However, while diverse in their clinical presentations, common environmental as well 
as genetic factors associated with susceptibility  to SpA are suspected (Turki
ewicz 2007). This 
latter notion was recently  corroborated by [CONTACT_144936] a large -scale single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) scan study , where IL23R variants that were previously  linked to 
Crohn`s disease and psoriasis (diseases that may both co-exist with spondy larthritides) 
conferred risk to developi[INVESTIGATOR_144916] (Barrett 2008). Together, a common 
pathway  including the IL -23/IL -17 axis may  play  a role in seronegative SpA including 
PsA.
PsA is a freque nt chronic immune -mediated disease encompassing a spectrum of overlappin g 
clinical entities (Moll and Wright 1973). About 10 -40% of patients with psoriasis suffer 
from PsA.Recent efforts were aimed at defining more stringent classification criteria for 
standardized recruitment into clinical trials ( Taylor 2006). PsA is associated with significant 
morbidity  and disabilit y, and thus constitutes a major socioeconomic burden. It is not only 
more common but also more severe than previously  thought ( Gladman 2004 ). The majorit y of 
patients will have psoriasis prior to the occurrence of the associated arthritis and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
under treatment for their skin disease. 
For musculoskeletal disease manifestations initially 
NSAIDs are used to alleviate symptoms. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_144917]-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) are used forPsA including methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, and 
leflunomide, however, these are often inadequate because they only partiall y control 
established disease ( Mease 2008). 
Several lines of evidence support the notion of prominent T 
cell involvement in the 
pathogenesis of PsA. Memory  CD4+ and CD8+ cells are present in skin lesions as well as the 
inflamed synovium that express activation markers and have characteristics of oligoclonal 
expan sion. (Curran 2004, Tassiulas 1999) Clinical trials demonstrated efficacy  of T cell 
targeted therapy  in PsA (cyclosporine A, CTLA4 Ig, alefacept). TNF blocking therapy  was 
successfull y introduced to the treatment of patients with PsA (Mease 2000). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_144918], an unmet clinical need exists for patients with PsA for better disease control and long 
term prevention of structural damage beyond mere 
abrogation of inflammatory  processes. 
Thus, current treatment options for patients with intolerance or an inadequate response to anti -
TNFα agents are limited. 
IL-17 antagonism represents a novel therapeutic approach aimed at interference with the 
chronic inflammatory  process by [CONTACT_144937] y targeting the predominant pro-inflammatory 
cytokine of the T helper 17 cell subset. Additional effects of anti-IL17 on bone homoeostasis 
via RANKL  and IL-
1, upstream of TNFα, can be inferred from animal studies (Koenders 
2005). Assuming a potential role of IL-17 cells in the inflammatory  infiltrate in PsA, it can be 
speculated that locally disturbed homeostasis of osteoclastogenic and osteoblastogenic 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 18

mechanisms characteristic of PsA might be affected by [CONTACT_8668]-17 blockade thus potentially 
providing a therapeutic advancement to prevent structural damage in PsA. 
Secukinumab (AIN457) is a high-affinit y fully human monoclonal anti-human antibod y that 
neutralizes IL-17A activity . IL-17A is the key cytokine in the newly  discovered Th17 
pathway  which is thought to be an important mediator of autoimmunity . Neutralization of IL-
17A has strong pre-clinical and clinical target validation and documenta tion of efficacy  in a 
proof of concept study  (CAIN457A2101) and a phase II study  (CAIN457F2201) in 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). IL-17A has been shown to play  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_144919] (MMP) activation and stimulation of osteoclast -mediated bone 
resorption (Stamp 2004 ; Witowski 2004; Moseley 2003 ). A proof -of concept study  conducted 
in subject s with PsA (CAIN457A2206; n=42) suggests that a clinically  meaningful response 
for signs and symptoms is induced as early  as 2 weeks after start of secukinumab treatment, 
with further improvement up to Week 6 and maintenance of response up to Week 16. 
Therefore, treatment with secukinumab may also reduce loss of cartilage and erosion of bone 
in PsA and may result in improvement of symptom s and functional joint manifestations in 
afflicted patients. Furthermore, in a completed proof of concept study  (CAIN457A2102), the 
effects of secukinumab administered at 3 mg/kg as a single intravenous infusion were 
compared with that of placebo in thirty-six subjects with active chronic plaque -type psoriasis. 
The study  demonstrated efficacy  at the 4-week endpoint and continuous efficacy  at 12 weeks 
based on Psoriasis Area and Severity  Index (PASI) and Investigator’s Global Assessment mod 
(IGA mod 2011) e ndpoints.
As of January 2013, approximately  [ADDRESS_165839] received secukinumab. Overall, 
healthy  volunteers and patients across various indications (psorias is, RA, AS, PsA, multiple 
sclerosis, uveitis, Crohn’s disease, dry eye, polymyalgia rheumatica) have received 
secukinumab at doses ranging from single and multiple doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg i.v. 
and 25mg to 300mg s.c. In total, [ADDRESS_165840] been enrolled into thecore study
(CAIN457F2306 )with secukinumab. Safety results from all completed studies show 
comparable numbers of adverse events in subjects treated with secukinumab compared to 
placebo without indication of any specific organ toxicity . Please refer to the Investigator 
Brochure for a more detailed review of the pre-clinical and clinical information on 
secukinumab.
1.2 Purpose

3 Investigational plan
3.1 Stud y design
Core study  (CAIN457F2306) design is provided in Appendix 11.
This extension study  will employ  a parallel group, double blind design for the first year (up 
to and excluding Week 156)followed by [CONTACT_3440]- label design for the next two years
(Week 156 onwards) . The blinding during first year of this extension study  is required to 
ensure that 52-week data from the core study  arecleaned and locked before unblinding the 
subjects in the extension study .
Investigators will use their clinical judgment to decide if it is beneficial for subjects to enter 
the extension study  based upon overall improvement and response to therapy  during the 2
-
year period of the core study  CAIN457F2306.
The total combined duration of treatment for the core study andthis extension study  is 5years. 
As thislong-term study  extends the pi[INVESTIGATOR_144920]457F2306 by [CONTACT_102160] 3 years itmay be affected by [CONTACT_144938] 's review or potential product approval 
considerations. I f the product is approved during study  conduct, dose groups in this extension 
study may be amended (via a future protocol amendment) based on agency  recommendations 
for product usage in this indication.
At Week 104 of the study  CAIN457F2306, eligible subjects will complete the assessments
associated with the core study  visit and will subsequently continue in the extension study  on 
the same dose (secukinumab 75mg or secukinumab 150mg every  4 weeks) that they were 
receiving during the core study .
At each study treatment time point till Week 152, two s.c. injection sin the form of PFS 
will be administered. This is necessary  to maintain the blind, as secukinumab is available in 
either 0.5 ml (75 mg) PFS or 1.0 ml (150 mg) PFS. Placebo to secukinumab is also available 
in 0.5 ml and 1. 0 ml PFS to match the active drug.
Group 1: secukinumab 75 mg (0.5mL) plus placebo (1mL )once every  four weeks till (and 
including) Week 152
Group 2: secukinumab 150mg (1mL) plus placebo (0.5mL )once every four weeks till 
(and including) Week 152
At each study treatment time point starting atWeek 156, one or two s.c. injection sin the 
form of PFS will be administered. This will be open label treatment.
Group 1: secukinumab 75mg (0.5mL) once every  four weeks till (and including) Week 
256. After approval and implementation of Amendment 1, patients may be escalated to 
150 mg or 300 mg as judged appropriate b y the investigator. 
Group 2: secukinumab 150mg (1mL) once every  four weeks till (and including) Week 
256. After approval and implemen tation of Amendment 1, patients may be escalated to 
300 mg as judged appropriate b y the investigator.
Study  treatment dose adjustments are not permitted until Week 156 .
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 21
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
Starting from Week 156 (i.e. during the open label study period), after approval and 
implementation of Amendment 1, the secukinumab dose should be escalated from 75 mg 
to 150 mg for patients whose signs and symptoms are not fully controlled with the 
curren t dose of 75 mg, and may improve with higher dose as judged by [CONTACT_093].
Further, the dose should also be escalated to 300 mg for patients currently on 75 mg or 
150 mg,and whose signs and symptoms are not fully controlled and may improve 
further w ith an increase in dose as judged by [CONTACT_093].
Dose escalation from secukinumab 75 mg to 300 mg can be done either in one step or in 
two steps (first 150 mg ,then 300 mg based on investigator’s judgement).
For patients escalated to 150 mg or 300 mg, no dose reduction can be performed at a 
later stage.
Subjects will continue to be on background methotrexate (MTX) (if they  were alread y taking 
MTX at the start of core study  CAIN457F2306) throughout the study . The dose of MTX may 
be adjusted as deemed appropriate by[CONTACT_093] . 
In addition subjects will be allowed to start or adjust the dose of corticosteroids and non-
steroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) as  deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]
. 
Before enrolment in this extension study , all subjects electing to continue will sign an 
Informed Consent form . After approval and implementation of Amendment 1, all subjects 
electing to continue will sign a new version of the Informed Consent form. Detailed 
instructions forself-administration ofthe s.c injection using the PFS formulation will be 
provided to each subject. Each injection will be administered into an appropriate injection site 
of the body . For the first 6 months of the extension study  (up to Week 128), all injections will 
be performed at site. Starting from Week [ADDRESS_165842] ration at home or continuing with administration at site, based on personal 
preference and the investigator’s clinical judgment. Site staff or caregiver (once trained) will 
administer the injection to subjects who are not able or feel insecure to self-administer the 
PFS injection.
On-site visits to assess safety  and efficacy  will be scheduled at 4-16 week intervals during the 
study . Assessment s for safet y, efficacy , PK  will be performed according 
to the assessment schedule.
Efficacy  assessments will be performed at regular intervals in this study , and after careful 
evaluation of disease status/activity , investigators should discontinue subjects who are 
deemed not to be benefiting from the study  treatment
,based onlack of improvement or 
worsening of their symptoms. Moreover, subjects are free to discontinue participation in the 
study  at an y time for lack of efficacy or for an yother reason.

and locking of the 52- week data from the core study .
3.3 Rationale of dose/regimen, route of administration and duration 
of treatment
The doses and regimen selected for secukinumab phase III study  (CAIN457F2306) were
projected to deliver efficacy  while at the same time ensuring subject safety . The proposal to 
continue treatment with s.c. doses of 75mg and 150 mg administered every  four weeks, as 
well as the additional treatment duration of up to 156 weeks (leading toan overall treatment 
period [core plus extension] of 260 weeks) was based on the need for long-term treatment 
exposure in subjects suffering from a chronic illness such as psoriatic arthritis.
The extension study  initially  continued to evaluate two doses (75mg and 150mg) using PFS in 
order to characterize the long -term safety  profile for a higher and a lower secukinumab dose.Week 104  108   112  116            128               140                   156                            256   260       F268

of Amendment 1, to Secukinumab administration of:
Group 1: 75 mg, 150mg or 300 mg s.c. 
Group 2: [ADDRESS_165844] unblindedStart of extension phase
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 23
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
The analysis of the 2 Phase III studies conducted in PsA patients (see Rationale for 
Amendment 1) led to the conclusion that to maintain a clinicall y meaningful response during 
the entire duration of the extension study , the dose of secukinumab should be escalated from 
75 mg sc every  4 weeks to 150 mg sc every  4 weeks for patients whose signs and symptoms 
may be improved with a higher dose, as judged by [CONTACT_093]. Further, the dose should 
also be escalated to 300 mg sc every  4 weeks for patients currently  on 75 mg or 150 mg dose, 
as judged b y investigator. 
The dose escalation from secukinumab 75 mg sc to 300 mg sc can be done either in one step 
or in two steps (first 150 mg sc and then 300 mg sc). These dose modifications are 
implemented through Amendment 1.
Secukinumab can be currentl y administered by [CONTACT_144939]. Drug delivery  using this formulation either for 
intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection requires commitment to regular clinic or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_144921]. 
Subcutaneou s injection through PFS offers the option of self -administration by  [CONTACT_144940] a better treatment experience and added convenience. Patients with 
chronic diseases who are able to self-inject their medication gain control of their treatment 
schedule and their treatment setting, thus allowing greater independence, better adherence, 
improved therapeutic outcomes and freedom in their social, domestic, and professional lives , 
which can result in economic benefits to both patient sand the healthcare system (Kivitz 
2006) ; (Chilton 2008). Self-injection may also offer psychological benefits over 
administration by  [CONTACT_129000], including improved self -esteem (Hamm 2000 ).
Bioequivalence between the secukinumab lyophilisate and pre-filled syringe formulation has 
been established in study  CAIN457A2106 in [ADDRESS_165845] criteria for assuming bioequivalence. The use of the PFS was safe and well -tolerated. 
Therefore, in study  CAIN457F2306E1, it is cons idered appropriate to use secukinumab in 
PFS for the administration of secukinumab in the same doses and regimen as in the core study 
(CAIN45 7F2306) which used thelyophilisate formulation.
3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator
There is no placebo control group or active comparator in this study  given the purpose and 
main objectives. However, the current design will allow assessment of multiple doses in 
terms of long term efficacy  and safet y.
3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptation s
Interim analy ses are planned in order to support regulatory  filing and for purposes of 
publication after subjects complete year 1 (Treatment period 3), and year 2 (Treatment period 
4) of treatment in this extension study . Additional analy ses may be perfo rmed to support 
heath authorit y interactions, as necessary.

3.6 Risks and benefits
The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by [CONTACT_144941], 
close clinical monitoring, and extensive guidance for the investigators provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
As of July 2014, up to [ADDRESS_165846] received secukinumab. Overall, healthy  volunteers
and patients across various ind ications (psoriasis, RA, AS, PsA, multiple sclerosis, uveitis, 
Crohn’s disease, dry  eye, poly myalgia rheumatica) have received secukinumab at doses 
ranging from single and multiple doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg i.v. and 25mg to 300mg s.c ..
Key results fro m the larger completed Phase II and III studies support a favorable benefit-risk 
profile for secukinumab in PsA patients.
Secukinumab has shown either preliminary  or confirmed efficacy  in several inflammatory
diseases. The safety  profile of secukinumab is primarily  based on the aggregate safet y data
from 10 large completed phase II/III psoriasis trials. The evaluation of safet y data from
completed PsA trials did not show additional safet y concerns. Secukinumab was generall y 
safe and well -tolerated. The most frequentl y reported adverse events are infections, especiall y 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_144922]. There was an increase in 
mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis with secukinumab compared toplacebo, but the cases were 
mild or moderate in severity , non- serious, and responsive to standard treatment.
There was a small increase in mild neutropenia cases with secukinumab compared to placebo.
Common Toxicity  Criteria (CTC) AE grade 3 neutropenia (<1.0 -0.5x109/L) was uncommonly
observed with secukinumab, most were transient and reversible without a temporal
relationship to serious infections. Hypersensitivity  reactions include urticarial and rare event 
of anaph ylactic reaction to secukinumab were also observed in clinical studies.
Taking into account the available safet y data for the individual risks outlined in the IB, the 
expected risk profile of secukinumab from a mechanism of action perspective is anticipated to 
be similar or improved compared to approved cytokine targeting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The risk to 
subjects inthis trial will be minimized by [CONTACT_144941], close 
clinical monitoring and extensive guidance to the investigators, provided in the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
From the standpoint of the overall risk-benefit assessment ,the current trial with secukinumab 
is justified.

5.2 Treatment arms
All subjects will initially  continue to receive the same dose of secukinumab they were 
receiving during the treatment period of the core study  (CAIN457F2306). No re-
randomization is planned.
Subjects from thetwo treatment arms will receive following treatments : 
Till Week 152
Group 1: secukinumab 75 mg plus placebo 1mL  once every  four weeks till (and including) 
Week 152
Group 2: secukinumab 150 plus placebo 0.5mL mg once every  four weeks till (and 
including) Week 152 
Starting with Week 156, after approval and implementation ofAmendment 1, the allowed 
doses within both treatment arms will be modified as described below.
Group 1: secukinumab 75 mg once every  four weeks till (and including) Week 256 . After 
implementation of Amendment 1: secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg.
Group 2: secukinumab 150 mg once every  four weeks till (and including) Week 256 . After  
implementation of Amendment 1: secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg.
The dose should be escalated from 75 mg to 150 mg sc for patients whose signs and 
symptoms arenotfully controll ed, as judged by [CONTACT_093], with the current 75 mg. 
Further the dose should also be escalated to 300 mg for patients currentl y on 75 mg or 150 mg 
dose, and whose signs and symptoms are not controlled well, as judged by [CONTACT_1697]. The 
dose escalat ion from secukinumab 75mg sc to300 mg sc can be done either in one step or in 
two steps (first 150 mgscand then 300mg sc based on investigator’ s judgement ).These dose 
modifications are implemented through Amendment 1.
As thislong term study  extends the pi[INVESTIGATOR_144920]457F2306 by  [CONTACT_33018] 
[ADDRESS_165849] ,dose groups in this extension study may be 
amended (via a future protocol amendment) based on eventual agency  recommendations for 
product usage in this indication.
5.3 Treatment assignment, randomization
There is no re-randomization in this extension study . At Week 104E1,all eligible subje cts 
from core study  will be enrolled via Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) and will continue 
to receive same dose of secukinumab that they were receiving during the treatment period of

5.4 Treatment blinding
This will be a double -blind, double -dummy  treatment trial till Week 156. Subjects and
investigat ive sitestaff will remain blinded to the identity  of the treatment until Week 156, 
using the following methods:
1.Randomization/treatment assignment data (from the core study ) are kept strictl y 
confidential until the time of unblinding and will not be accessible by [CONTACT_144947]
2.The identity  of the treatments will be concealed by [CONTACT_144948] s
that are all identical in packaging, schedule of administration and appearance 
A double -dumm y design is used because the identity  of the study  treatments (PFS) (75mg vs. 
150mg) cannot be disguised due to their different volumes (0.5 ml vs. 1.0 ml).
Up toWeek 156, unblinding investigative site staff will only occur in the case of subject 
emergencies (see Section 5.5.10 ).
Starting at Week 156, the treatment arm for individual subjects will be unblinded and the 
study  will be conducted open -label.
5.[ADDRESS_165850] numbers will remain same as that of core study  CAIN457F230 6; new subject 
numbers will not be assigned .
5.5.2 Dispensing the investigational treatment
Each study  site will be supplied by [CONTACT_144949].
The investigational treatment packaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number 
printed on each part of this label corresponds to one of the two treatment arms. Investigator 
staff will identify  the investigational treatment package(s) todispense to the subject by 
[CONTACT_105245](s). Immediatel y before dispensing 
the package to the subject , investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the 
packaging and affix it to the source docume nt (Drug Label Form) for that subject ’s unique 
subject number.
After Week 132, if subjects opt for domiciliary  treatment/home administration (at time points 
specified in Table 6-1, Table 6-2, and Table 6-3) the investigator will dispense, via IRT, an 
appropriate number of investigational treatment packages for domiciliary  administrations . 
Detailed instructions on the self-administration of the study  treatment will be described in the 
IFU.The IFU will be provided to each subject and should be reviewed in detail by  [CONTACT_144950].

Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
5.5.3 Handling of study  treatment
[IP_ADDRESS] Handling of investigat ional treatment
Investigational treatment must be received by a designated person at the study  site, handled 
and stored safel y and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator 
and designees have access. Upon receipt, all investig ational treatment should be stored 
according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only  
in accordance with the protocol. The investigator should educate the subject on how to
properl y store the stud y treatment if the subject is self -administering at home .
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the receipt and dispensing of 
investigational treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability  will 
be performed by  [CONTACT_144951] r during site visits and at the completion of the trial. Subjects
will be asked to return all unused investigational treatment and packaging at the end of the 
study  or at the time of discontinuation of investigational treatment. 
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study , the 
investigator will return all unused investigational treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a 
copy  of the completed drug accountability  log to the [COMPANY_001] monitor or to the [COMPANY_001] 
address provi ded in the investigator folder at each site.
5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment
All study  treatments (75 mg secukinumab or 150mg secukinumab ; after implementation of 
Amendment 1 secukinumab 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg) will be self-admini stered 
subcutaneousl y by [CONTACT_144952] . The caregiver or site staff 
will administer the injection only  to those subjects who are not able to self -administer the PFS 
injection.
Each subject will require two PFS per dose (i.e. two uniquely numbered medication package s)
till (and including) Week 152. Starting atWeek [ADDRESS_165851] will require one or twoPFS per dose, depending on the dose they are assigned to as 
per investigator’s judgement. Week [ADDRESS_165852] during the study  will be in the IRT
database . It shall be recorded on the corresponding eCRF(s) whether the subject self-
administered the PFS, or whether site staff or the caregiver administered the PFS and whether 
it was administered at home or at site.
The PFS will be provided by [CONTACT_144953], who will self -administer the injections at 
the specified study  time point. Detailed instructions forself-administration of study  treatment 
will be described in the IFU that are to be provided to each subject.
Initiall y self-injection will take place under the supervision of a site staff member. At Week 
104E1visit the subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_7893], using the IFU, on how to self-
inject via PFS. Subjects will be asked to raise questions (if any), and then to proceed with 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_165853] study  treatment administration will occur at the Week 104E1visit 
after inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed, all study  scheduled assessments have 
been performed and the scheduled blood samples have been drawn.
At subsequent site visits, subjects will be asked to refer to the IFU and to proceed with self-
injection.
At each subsequent study  visit at site, all study  assessments, including the completion of 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and pre-dose blood sample collection (wherever required) 
(Table 6-1, Table 6-2and Table 6-3), should be completed prior to the self-administration of 
the study  treatment.
All dosages dispensed to the subject andall dose changes during the study must be recorded 
on the Dosage Administration Record eCRF. Immediately  before dispensing the package to 
the subject, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and 
affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject’s unique subject number. 
Forthose subjects who opt for domiciliary  / home administrations (at protocol specified time 
points) site staff will dispense (via IRT),at the prior site visit, an appropriate number of 
investigational treatment packages for the applicable upcoming domiciliary  administrations .
The investigator should promote compliance by [CONTACT_144954] e is necessary  for the subject’s safet y and the 
validity  of the study . The subject should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_087]/she is 
unable for any reason to attend a study  visit as scheduled or if he/she is unable for any reason 
to take the st udy treatment as prescribed.
Administration
Secukinumab solution for s.c. injection will be provided in PFS. Two s.c. injection sshould be 
self-administered at each visit / time -point (secukinumab 75mg in 0.5mL plus placebo 1mL or 
secukinumab 150mg in 1mL plus placebo 0.5mL )till (and including Week 152). Starting at
Week 156, placebo injections will not be required . Hence, upon implementation of 
Amendment 1,one or two s.c. injections would be dispensed for each dosing time point , 
depending on the secukinu mab dose the patient is assigned to b y the investig ator.
Subjects will be instructed at Week 104E1by [CONTACT_144955]-inject secukinumab via 
PFS,in accordance with the IFU. The study  treatment solution should be injected 
subcutaneousl y into an appropriate injection site,and each injection should be given at a 
different site.
Each new injection should be given at least one inch from the previousl y used site. If subject 
chooses the abdomen, [ADDRESS_165854] has scars or stretch marks. Injection sites should be rotated to reduce the risk of 
reaction.
Single syringes will be packed in individual boxes. The boxes containing the PFS with study 
treatment solution should be kept at 2 to 8°C (36°F to46°F, do not freeze) and protected from 
light. Prior to administration ,the unopened boxes containing the PFS should be allowed to 
come to room temperature in a place protected from light for approximately 20 minutes. Used 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 31
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
syringe sshould be disposed immediatel y after use in a sharps container OR according to the 
regulatory  requirements inthe respective countr y.
The caregiver or site staff will administer the injection only  to those subjects who are not able 
to self -administer the PFS injection.
Domiciliary  administration
Starting with week 132 (after initial 24weeks of extension study  of self-administered 
treatment under the supervision of site staff), subjects will be allowed to self-administer the 
PFS at home when they  are not visiting the site for any  other trial related procedures. The trial 
related safety  and efficacy  procedures will be conducted every  12-16 weeks during Treatment 
Periods 3, 4 and 5.
The subjects will be allowed to self-administer treatment at home (starting from Week 132) 
only if they have exhibited correct use for self-administering the PFS at the site during the 
first [ADDRESS_165855] at the site.
It should be recorded on the corresponding eCRF(s) whether the subject self-administered the 
PFS and whether it was administered at home or at the site.
Prior to self -administration at home, subjects should contact [CONTACT_093] / site staff in case 
they are experiencing any  AE/SAEs or have any  concerns.
If the subject is not able / not confident to self-administer the PFS, and the caregiver is 
unable/unwilling to perform the injection, he/she should visit the site every 4 weeks 
during the treatment p eriod and site staff will administer the PFS .
5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study  treatment
Study  treatment dose adjustments are not permitted until Week 156 .
After approval and implementation of Amendment 1, patients previously treated with 
secukinumab 75 mg may receive either 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg, and patients 
previously treated with secukinumab 150 mg may receive 150 mg or 300 mg, as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_473] . The decision may be taken at any on-site visit. When 
dose escalation has been performed for one patient, no dose reduction can be performed 
at a later stage.
Study  treatment interruption is also not permitted with the following exceptions:
Study  treatment interruption is permitted only if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a 
subject is deemed to be placed at a significant safet y risk unless dosing is temporarily 
interrupted. In such cases study  treatment should be interrupted only during the time 
that this risk is present and ongoing. Study  treatment can be restar ted at the next 
scheduled visit after resolution of the safet y risk.
The effect of secukinumab on live vaccines is unknown; therefore live vaccines should 
not be administered during participation in the study . In case a live vaccine has been 
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page [ADDRESS_165856] is experiencing either no benefit from participation in 
the trial or worsening / exacerbation of their disease. Serious consideration should be given to 
withdraw subjects who require signif icant amounts of rescue medication. All medication 
changes must be recorded in the Prior/ Concomitant medications eCRF page.
Subjects will continue to be on background MTX (if they were alread y taking MTX at the 
start of core study  CAIN457F2306) throughout the study . The dose of MTX may be adjusted 
as deemed appropriate and necessary  at the investigator’s discretion in this extension study .
Any use of rescue medication must be recorded on the corresponding Concomitant 
Medications eCRF.

the CRF.
Methotre xate
In subjects on MTX , dose of MTX (≤25 mg/week) may be adjusted as deemed appropriate 
and necessary  at the investigator’s discretion.
Folic acid
Subjects taking MTX must also be taking folic acid supplementation during the trial to 
minimize the likelihood of MTX associated toxicity . Folic acid supplementation should not be 
taken on the same day  of MTX intake.
Systemic corticosteroids
The dose and regimen of systemic corticosteroids (oral or intramuscular) may be modified as 
deemed appropriate and necess ary and as per investigator’s judgment and subject need. Any 
change in the dose of systemic corticosteroids during the trial must be recorded on the 
corresponding eCRF page.
Intra -articular corticosteroids
As per investigator’s judgment and subject need, intra -articular corticosteroid injections can 
be performed. The total dose administered must be recorded on the corresponding eCRF page.

study  treatment discontinuation:
Withdrawal of informed consent
Emergence of the following adverse events:
Any severe or serious adverse event that is not compatible with administration of 
study  medication, including adverse events that require treatment with an 
unacceptable co -medication
Onset of ly mphoproliferative disease or any malignancy except for treated basal cell

Pregnancy
Use of an y biologic immunomodulating agent except secukinumab
 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 34
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
Any protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the subject ’s safety
In addition to the requirements menti oned above for study  treatment discontinuation, the 
investigator should discontinue study  treatment for a given subject if there is a lack of 
improvement or worsening of their symptoms , or if, on balance, he/she believes that 
continuation would be detrimental to the subject’s well -being.
For subjects who discontinue study  treatment a Dosage Administration Record eCRF should 
be completed, giving the date and primary  reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_79558].
The investigator must also interact with the IRT to register the subject’s discontinuation from 
study  treatment.
Subjects may voluntaril y withdraw from the study  for any reason at any time. They  may be 
considered withdrawn if they  state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or become 
lost to foll ow-up for an y other reason.
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must make every  effort to 
determine the primary  reason for a subject’s premature withdrawal from the study  and record 
this information on the appropriate Study  Phas e Disposition CRF.
For all subjects who discontinue or withdraw from the study ,the investigator should ensure 
that the subject completes an end of treatment visit (corresponding to the last visit for the 
subject’s current period of treatment) [ADDRESS_165860] study  treatment, and also returns after 
an additional 8 weeks for a final follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_165861] study  treatment, see 
Table 6-1, Table 6-2and Table 6-3). The final visit should be performed before any new 
treatment is initiated.
Lost to follow -up
For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e. those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study  visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator should 
show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_144956], e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, emails etc.
Replacement
Subjects who are prematurel y withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.
5.5.[ADDRESS_165862] , he/she must provide the requested subject identify ing information and 
confirm the necessity  to break the treatment code for the subject . The investigator will then 
receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or 
email confirming this information. The sy stem will autom atically  inform the [COMPANY_001] monitor 
for the site and the Global Trial Leader (GTL) that the code has been broken.

It is the investigator’s responsibility  to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the IRTin case of emergency . The investigator will inform the subject how to contact 
[CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency  when he/she is unavailable. The investigator will 
provide the protocol number (CAIN457F2306E1) , investigational treatment name [CONTACT_90228], 
subject number, and instructi ons for contact[CONTACT_144957] (or any  entit y to which

weeks in the combined core study  and extension study  (last dose being administered at Week 
256) and upon completion of thescheduled study  assessments and procedures up to and 
including Visit F268.
Information on the subject’s completion or discontinuation of the study and the reason for 
discontinuation of the study  will be recorded on the appropriate Study Phase Completion 
eCRF page.
A Study  Phase Completion evaluation (associated with the last visit of the subject’s phase of 
the study : e.g. Week 156, Week 208 or Week 260) must also be performed when a subject 
prematurel y withdraws from the study  for whatever reason. In any case, the investigator or 
site staff must contact [CONTACT_144958]’s study  completion 
(Visit F268) and/or discontinuation.
The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all subject s who are prematurel y 
withdrawn from the study , or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. This care may 
include another treatment outside of the study  as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. This 
treatment may be any  non-biologic DMARD. In case of a biologic treatment, a waitin g period

the vi sits are performed.
Subjects should be seen for all visits on the designated day or as close to it as possible. 
Subjects should not receive study  medication within less than [ADDRESS_165866] study  treatment administration, at which time all the assessments listed 
for EoT for the given treatment period (Week 156 or 208 or 260) will be performed (see
Section 5.5.9 ). Subjects will then return to the study  site [ADDRESS_165867] study 
treatment administration for further assessments as indicated under the follow -up visits (F268).
If they refuse to return for these assessments or are unable to do so, every  effort should be 
made to contact [CONTACT_18622] a knowledgeable informant by [CONTACT_144959] g appropriate 
correspondence (i.e. certified letter) immediatel y. At this contact, the safety  (e.g., potential

6.4.1 American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) response
The primary  efficacy  variable is the clinical response to treatment according to ACR20, 
ACR50 and ACR [ADDRESS_165884] 
will be considered a responder ac cording to ACR20 criteria if he/she has at least:
20% improvement in tender 78- joint count
and 20% improvement in swollen 76- joint count
and 20% improvement in at least 3 of the following 5 measures:
Patient’s assessment of PsA pain (measured on a VAS 100 mm)
Patient’s global assessment of disease activity  (measured on a VAS 100 mm)
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity  (measured on a VAS 100 mm)
Patient self -assessed disability  (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ

Acute phase reactant (C -reactive protein [hsCRP] or ESR)
Similarly , asubject will be considered a ACR50 (orACR70) responder if he/she shows at 
least 50% (or 70%) improvement as per the above mentioned criteria.
The ACR response is to be assessed at the visits/time points shown in Table 6 -1, Table 6 - 2
and Table 6-3.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tender 78 joint count and swollen 76 joint count
Joint counts will be performed by [CONTACT_144962](s) who must be well trained and part of the 
site personnel . Whenever possible, the same evaluator should perform these assessments 
at all visits.

hands, the 2 hip, 2 knee, 2 ankle, 2 tarsus, 10 metatarsophalangeal, 10 proximal 
interphalangeal, and 8 distal interphalangeal joints of the feet. All of these except for the 
hips are assessed for swelling. Joint tenderness and swelling are to be graded present (1) or 
absent (0). Sy novial fluid and/or soft tissue swelling but not bony  overgrowth represents a 
positive result for swollen joint count. Dacty litis of a digit in the foot or hand counts as 
one tender and swollen joi nt. 
 

Novarti s Confidential Page 45
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
Data is to be recorded for tender and swollen joints (right or left side), i.e. a box (no, yes 
or not applicable) needs to be ticked for all joints. The total number of tender and swollen 
joints (right and left) will be automaticall y calculated in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient’s assessment of PsA  pain intensity
The patient’s assessment of pain will be performed using 100 mm visual analog scale 
(VAS) ranging from “no pain” to “unbearable pain” after the question “Please indicate 
with a vertical mark ( | ) through the horizontal line the most pain you had from your 
psoriatic arthritis today ”.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient’s global assessment of disease activity
The patient’s global assessment of disease activity  will be performed using 100mm VAS 
ranging from ”very  good” to ”very  poor”, after the question "Considering all the ways 
psoriatic arthritis affects you, please indicate with a vertical mark ( | ) through the 
horizontal line how well you are doing today ”. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physician’s global assessment of disease activity
The physician’s global assessment of disease activity  will be performed using 100mm 
VAS ranging from no disease activit y to maximal disease activity , after the question 
"Considering all the ways the disease affects your patient, draw a line on the scale for 
how well his or her condition is today” . To enhance objectivity , the phy sician must not be 
aware of the specific patient’s global assessment of disease activity , when performing his 
own assessment on that patient.
[IP_ADDRESS] HAQ-DI
The HAQ- DI is a secondary  efficacy endpoint for this study .It is also one of the 
components of the ACR response. The HAQ©was developed by [CONTACT_144963]-term influence of chronic 
disease on a subject's level of functi onal ability and activity  restriction. The disabilit y 
assessment component of the HAQ, the HAQ- DI, assesses a subject's level of functional 
ability  and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity , locomotor 
activities of the lower extremity , and activities that involve both upper and lower 
extremities. There are [ADDRESS_165886] week "Are you able to …" perform a particular task. Each item is 
scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, representing normal (normal, no difficulty  [0]),

6.4.2 Radiog raphic assessments
Separate radiographs of each hand/wrist (PA) and each foot (AP) will be taken at Week 
156, 208 and 260. 
From time of implementation of Amendment 2, radiographs at Week 260 will not be 
obtained as part of the study .
Bone erosion, joint space narrowing (JSN), and total radiographic scores will be 
determined using a PsA modified van der Heijde -Sharp (vdH-S) scoring method ( van der 
Heijde 2005)  that includes the second through fifth distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of 
each hand. Erosions (0–5 in the hands and 0–10 in the feet) and JSN (0–4) will be graded 
separately  in six wrist joints, all metacarp ophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and DIP 
joints of each hand, and the first interphal angeal joint and all metatarsal phalangeal joints 
for each foot. The total radiographic score (hands and feet combined) ranges from [ADDRESS_165888] film and cassettes will be

addition to the other safety  measures ensures the ability  to deliver data on a critical safet y 
endpoint for this class of therap y. The radiation exposure that results from X-ray 
measurements is not necessary  for medical care but is intended for research purposes only. 
The total amount of radiation from all X-ray measurements performed in this study  (3 X-rays

Pharmacokinetics
6.6.[ADDRESS_165894] of PsA on various aspects of subjects’ health-related quality  of life (HRQoL) will 
be assessed using the following validated instruments:
HAQ- DI(seeSection [IP_ADDRESS])


All questionnaires will be available, where possible, in the local languages of the participating 
countries and should be completed by [CONTACT_144968]. Only  the 
original paper questionnaires provided can be used (i.e. these pages must not be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_530])
All questionnaires will be completed at the defined visits/ time points listed in Table 6-1, 
Table 6-2and Table [ADDRESS_165895] seeing the investigator for any clinical 
assessment or evaluation. The questionnaires will be in the respondent’s local language. The 
subject should be given sufficient instruction, space, time and privacy  to complete the 
questionnaires. The study  coordinator should check the questionnaires for completeness and 
encourage the subject 
to complete any missing responses. The original questionnaires will be 
kept with the subject’s file as the source document.
Completed questionnaires should be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_093], before the 
clinical examination, for responses which may indicate potential AEs or SAEs. The 
investigator should review not only the responses to the questions in the questionnaires but 
also for any unsoli cited comments written by [CONTACT_423]. This assessment should be 
documented in the source records. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed the investigator should 
record the events as per instructions given in the relevant section of the protocol (see Section 
7). Investigators should not encourage the subjects to change the responses reported in the 
completed questionnaires.
Guidelines for administering the PRO questionnaires can be found in Appendix 10 .

descriptio n to assess secukinumab concentration will be described in the bioanaly tical raw 
data of the stud y and in the respective Bioanal ytical Data Report (BDR).
7 Safety  monitoring
7.1 Adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom or disease) in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
 

Novarti s Confidential Page 57
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
study . Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporal ly or causall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by  [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the subject
at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may  be detected when they  arevolunteered 
by [CONTACT_144970], laboratory  test, or 
other assessments.
Abnormal laboratory  values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria:
they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms, 
they are considered clinically significant, 
they require therapy . 
Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values or test results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinicall y notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typi[INVESTIGATOR_144925]. Investigators have the responsibility  for managing the safet y of individual 
subject and identify ing adverse events. Alert ranges for labs and other test abnormalities 
are 
included in Appendix 1 .
Adverse events should be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or 
diagnosis associated with them accompanied by  [CONTACT_6644].
the severit y grade 
mild: usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal activities
moderate: sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal activities
severe: prevents normal activities
its relationship to the study  treatment (no/ yes)
its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not 
recovered/not resolved should be reported.
whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
action taken regarding investigational treatment 
whether other medication or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95254] (concomitant medication/non -drug

its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with seq uelae; fatal; or unknown)
An SAE is any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable 
sign(s), s ymptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any  one of the following criteria 
is fatal or life -threatening 
results in persist ent or significant disability /incapacity
constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless

deterioration in condition
elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study  and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
treatment on an emergency  outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999] ’s 
general condition
is medically  significant, i.e. de fined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically  significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements; see Section 7.2.
All adverse events should be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the 
following: no action taken (i.e. further observation only); investigational treatment dosage 
adjusted/temporaril y interrupted; study  drug(s) permanently  discontinued; concomitant 
medication given; non-drug therapy  given. The action taken to treat the adverse event should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. 
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequentl y, if 
necessary ) of any changes in severit y, the suspected relationship to the investigational 
treatment ,the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.
Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigator Brochure (IB) or will be com municated between IB updates in the 
form of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the subject informed 
consent and should be discussed with the subject during the stud y as needed.
The investigator should also instruct each subjec tto report any  new adverse event (beyond the 
protocol observation period) that the subject , or the subject ’s personal physician, believes 
might reasonabl y be related to study  treatment. This information should be recorded in the 
investigator’s source docu ments, however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001].
7.[ADDRESS_165897] has stopped study  participation 
(whichever is later) must be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.
Any SAEs experienced after this30 days period should only be reported to [COMPANY_001] if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. 
 

Novarti s Confidential Page 59
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinicall y 
thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete 
the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_165898] be reported as a follow -up 
to that event regardless of when it occurs.  The follow -up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was 
broken or not, and whet her the patient continued or withdrew from study  participation.
If the SAE is not previously  documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert 
(new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the investigational treatment a Drug Safet y 
and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_144926] y require further information from the 
investigator for Health Authority  reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same 
investig ational treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national
regulatory  requirements in participating countries.
7.[ADDRESS_165899] be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy 
should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary  termination, 
details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, 
or maternal and/or newborn complications.
Pregnancy  should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy  Form and reported by [CONTACT_50105] y and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_18540]. Pregnan cy 
follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the 
possible relationship to the study  treatment of any pregnancy  outcome.
Any SAE experienced during pregnancy  must be reported on the SAE Report Form.

8 Data revie w and da tabase management
8.1 Site monitoring
Before study  initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] 
representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the investigators and their staff. During 
the study , the field monitor will visit the site regularly  to check the completeness of subject
records, the accuracy  of entries on the CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good 
Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that investigational treatment is 
being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel 
must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits.
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
subject 's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
[CONTACT_423] (a signed copy  is given to the subject ).
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm 
their consistency  with the CRF entries. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary  variables. Additional 
checks of the consistency  of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the 
study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity  of the 
subject s will be disclosed.
8.2 Data collection

Novarti s Confidential Page 62
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
Data will be presented by a combination of the ‘original’ and ‘switch’ treatment groups. 
These treatment groups represent the treatment combination s the subjects experience over the 
course of the entire trial in case of re -randomization and dose escalation.
Note that the treatment groups for a subject may differ depending on the time period of the 
analysis and whether one assesses the subject for eff icacy  or safet y.
9.1 Analysis sets
The following anal ysis sets will be used in this study :
Full analysis set (FAS): The FAS will be comprised of all subjects enrolled in the study with 
at least one post baseline assessment of efficacy .Subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment assigned to .
Safety set: The safet y set includes all subjects enrolled in the study  who took at least [ADDRESS_165902] 
study  visit in the extension study  will be a concomitant medication, includin g those which 
were started before Week 104E1 and continued into the extension study  where study 
treatment is administered.
Medications will be presented in alphabetical order, by  [CONTACT_121974] 
(ATC) codes and grouped by [CONTACT_121975]. Tables will show the overall number 
and percentage of subjects receiving at least one treatment of a particular ATC code and at 
least one treatment in a particular anatomical main group.

The number and percentage of subjects receiving concomitant psoriatic arthritis therapy  will 
be presented by [CONTACT_144971][INVESTIGATOR_144930] (primary 
lack of efficacy , secondary  lack of efficacy , lack of tolerability , other) and the total duration 
of exposure to psoriatic arthritis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_144931] .
9.4 Analysis of the primary  variable(s)
9.4.1 Variable(s)
The primary  efficacy  variable(s) is the clinical response to treatment according to ACR20, 
ACR50 and ACR 70 improvement in disease activity  over time up to Week 260. ACR 
response criteria denote the response (i.e., improvement) in signs & symptoms of the disease 
of a subject compared to baseline of the core study . The analysis of the primary  variables will 
be based on the FAS. Primarily , CRP will be used instead of ESR to calculate ACR response; 
ESR will only  be used in the event CRP is missing.
9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis
No formal h ypotheses are planned for this study
. 
The proportion of subjects meeting the ACR criteria (ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70) will be 
descriptivel y summarized for each treatment group. Treatment efficacy will be evaluated by
[CONTACT_941]95% confidence interval ofthe proportion ofsubjects responding to treatment according to 
the ACR criteria .
No statistical comparison is expected to be performed between treatment 
doses .
Results will be presented for the FAS, as well as subgroups b y TNF -αstatus (naive or IR).
9.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations
Efficacy  data will be presented using all available data at the given time point of anal ysis.
Additionally , under the assumption of missing at random, multiple imputation by[CONTACT_144972]-baseline efficacy  variables of interes tduring the 
trial.
Continuous variables will be analy zed using a mixed -effects model repeated measures 
(MMRM) which is valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. For analyses of 
these parameters, if all extension post-baseline values are missing then these missing values 
will not be imputed and this subject will be removed from the analysis of the corresponding 
variable, i.e. it might be that the number of subjects providing data to an analysis is smaller 
than the number of subjects in the FAS.
9.4.4 Supportive analy ses
Sensitivity  analyses may be performed to assess the robustness of missing data handling. This
may include multiple imputation for ACR20/50.

Adverse events
Treatment emergent adverse events (i.e. events started after the first dose of secukinumab in 
core study  or events present prior to the first dose of secukinumab but increased in severity 
based on preferred term and within [ADDRESS_165903] dose of secukinumab ) will be 
summarized. 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage 
of subjects having any AE, having an AE in each primary  system organ class and having each 
individual AE (preferred term). Summaries will also be presented for AEs by [CONTACT_11370] y and for 
study  treatment related AEs. If a subject reported more than one adverse event with the same 
preferred term, the adverse event with the greatest severit y will be presented. If a subject

Separate summaries will be provided for death, serious adverse event, other significant 
adverse events leading to discontinuation and adverse events leading to dose adjustment 
(including stud y treatment discontinuation).
A graphical display  of relative frequencies within system organ classes and relative risks, as 
appropriate, will be presented.
When adjudication is required of major cardiovascular events, a summary  of those types of 
events as reported b y the investigator and confirmed by [CONTACT_144973].
Laboratory  data
The summary  of laboratory  evaluations will be presented for three groups of laboratory  tests 
(hematology , serum chemistry  and urinal ysis). Descriptive summary  statistics for the change 
from baseline to each study  visit will be presented. These descriptive summaries will be 
presented by [CONTACT_109057], laboratory  test and treatment group. Change from baseline will only 
be summarized for subjects with both baseline (of core stud y) and post baseline values. 
For each parameter, the maximum change from baseline within each study  period will be 
evaluated analogousl y. 
In addition, shift tables will be provided for all parameters to compare a subject’s baseline 
laboratory  evaluation relative to the visit’s observed value. For the shift tables, the normal 
laboratory  ranges will be used to evaluate whether a particular laboratory  test value was 
normal, low, or high for each visit value relative to whether or not the baseline value was 
normal, low, or high. These summaries will be presented by[CONTACT_144974]. Shifts will be presented b y visit as well as for most extreme values post -baseline.

13.5 Appendix 5: Disease A ctivit y Score 28(DAS28)
The Disease Activity  Score 28(DAS 28) is a combined index to measure the disease activity 
in patients with RA.  
Evaluation of response to a treatment can be made much 
easier and more objective using the 
DAS 28. Just assess the number of swollen and tender joints and measure the ESR. The DAS 
will provide you with a number between 0 and 10, indicating how active the disease is at this 
moment. Recently  the DAS 28-CRP has been developed. The C -reactive protein (CRP) or 
hsCRP may be used as an alternative to ESR in the calculation of the DAS28.
Using the DAS, several thresholds have been developed for high disease activity , low disease 
activity  or remission. Also response criteria have been developed based on the DAS 28, so 
when the DAS 28of a patient is measured at two time-points (e.g. before the start of a 
treatment and after 3 months), the patients clinical response can be assessed.
The DAS 28in clinical trials
Comparing the DAS28 from one patient on 
two different time-points, it is possible to define 
improvement or response. 
 
Tender and swollen 28-joint count :
The 28-jointsassessed for DAS28 include the 2 shoulders, 2 elbows, 2 wrists, 2 knees, 10 
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and 10 proximal interphalangeal (PI P) joints.
In order to calculate the D AS28, information about the following disease variables is needed:
The number of swollen joints and tender joints should be assessed using 28 -joint count 
(tender28 and swollen28).
The ery throcy te sedimentation rate (ESR) should be measured in mm/hour.
The patient’s general health (GH) or global disease activity  measured on a Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS) of 100 mm (both are useable for this purpose) must be obtained.
Using this data, the DAS28 can be calculated using the following formula:
DAS28 = 0.56 * sqrt( TJC28 + 0.28 * sqrt( SJC28 ) + 0.70 * ln(ESR) + 0.014 * GH

The DAS28 provides y ou with a number on a scale from 0 to 10 indicating the current activit y 
of the psoriatic arthritis of your patient. A DAS28 above 5.1 means high disease activit y 
whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity . Remission is achieved by a 
DAS28 lower than 2.6 (comparable to the PsA remission criteria).
Disease Activity Scores using C-reactive protein
C-reactive protein (CRP) or hsCRP may be used as an alternative to ESR in the calculation of 
the DAS28, using the formulas below. CRP is a more direct measure of inflammation than 
ESR, and it is more sensitive to short -term changes (Kushner 1991). CRP production is 
associated with radiological progression in RA (Van Leeuwen 1993) ), and is considered at 
least as valid as ESR to measure RA disease activity  (Mall ya 1982, Wolfe 1997). Another 
advantage of determination of CRP is that waiting time for the laboratory  result is shorter and 
that in case of multicenter studies a central laboratory  can be used.
The following formulas to calculate the DAS28 using CRP (mg/L) give good estimations of 
the original DAS28 values on a group level. DAS28
-4(CRP = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 
0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96
TJC28: 28 Tender joint count; SJC28: 28 Swollen joint count; CRP: C-reactive protein; GH: 
General Hea lth on a 100mm. Visual Analogue Scale.
It is strongl y advised to adhere either to ESR or to CRP determinations.

13.9 Appendix 9: Health A ssessment Questionnaire (HA Q)©
The HAQ(Fries JF et al. 1980) is a validated measure of physical disability  and functional 
status. It has four dimensions: disability , pain, drug side effects and dollar costs, although, the 
latter three are rarely  used in clinical trials. In this trial only the disability dimension will be 
used. The disability  dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficult y in 
performing eight common 
activities of daily  living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, 
walk ing, reaching, personal hygiene, grippi[INVESTIGATOR_144933]. Patients choose from four 
response categories, ranging from ‘without any difficulty ' to 'unable to do'. The ACR 
Rheumatology  Committee on Outcome Measures in RA recommends the use of this 
questionna ire in clinical trials.
Scoring of the HA Q©
The HAQ©will be scored in accordance with the recommendation from the developers 
outlined in the “HAQ PACK” from Stanford University , [LOCATION_004].
The following coding is to be used for the 8 categories of the di sability  outcome dimension:
Without ANY Difficulty [ADDRESS_165926] severe impairment 
contributes to the category  score. If the patient requires the use of aids, devices, or help from 
another to accomplish any of the activities in an associated category , then the score for that 
category  will be assigned the value 2, unless the score is alread y 3 (i.e. scores of 0 or 1 are 
increased to 2). Associated categories are defined in the “HAQ PACK”. From the scores for 
each category  a Standard Disability  Index (SDI) is computed by [CONTACT_144976]. The SDI is not 
computed if the patient does not have scores for at least 6 categories. This SDI is the HAQ©
score, which will be used in the statistical analy ses of this instrument. The range for this score 
is (0, 3).
HAQ© Data Collection
The HAQ©is to be completed by [CONTACT_144977]. The questionnaires 
should be completed by [CONTACT_90227] a quiet area free from disturbance, and before any visit 
assessments. Patients should receive no help from family  members; if questions cannot be 
answered alone (due toproblems with reading or understanding), then the doctor or nurse 
should read the questions and record the patient’s responses without influencing their answers. 
The information provided is strictly  confidential and will be treated as such. If a patient has 
missed a question or given more than one response per question, then this should be brought

that the sitenumber, subject number and initials (if applicable) are identical to the Case 
Record Form. As there are no source data for this questionnaire, the data queries will be 
restricted to patient/visit information.

13.10 Appendix 10: Guidelines for administering the PRO 
questionnaires
Before trial start
Study  coordinators should familiarize themselves with the PRO questionnaire(s) in the trial 
and identify  any items where apatient’s response might highlight issues of potential concern. 
For example, one question in the  
 If a patient responds ‘most or all of the time’, then the study 
coordinator should inform the study investigator.
Before completion
1. Subjects should be provided with the correct questionnaire
At the appropriate visits, and
In the appropriate language
2.Subjects should have adequate space and time to complete the forms
3. Patients should be provided with a firm writing surface (such as a table or a clip board) 
and a pencil
4.Questionnaire should be administered before the clinical examination
During completion
1.Administrator may  clarify  the questions but should not influence the res ponse
2.Only  one response for each question
3.Subjects should initial and date the last page of the questionnaires
4.Also see ‘Addressing Problems and Concerns’
After completion
1.Check for completeness and not for content*
2.Check for multiple responses that were made in error
3.
Data should be transcribed from the completed questionnaire to the appropriate screen on 
the e -CRF / electronic device.
4.File completed questionnaire in the patient stud y files**
*However, any response which may directly impact or reflect the patient’s medical condition (e.g. 
noting of depression) should be communicated by [CONTACT_144978]).
**If for some reason paper questioner is utilized for completion.
Addressing Problems and Concerns
Occasionally  a patient may haveconcerns or questions about the questionnaires administered. 
Guidance related to some of the most common concerns and questions are given below.
 

Novarti s Confidential Page 87
Amended Protocol Version 02 Clean Protocol No. CAIN457F2306E1
The patient does not want to complete the questionnaire(s)
Tell the patient that completion of the questionnai re(s) is voluntary . The goal is to better 
understand the physical, mental, and social health problems of patients. Emphasize that this 
information is as important as any of the other medical information, and that the 
questionnaire(s) is simple to complete. Suggest that the questionnaire(s) may be different 
from anything the respondent has filled in the past. If the patient still declines, retrieve the 
questionnaires. Record the reason for the decline, and thank the patient.
The patient is too ill or weak to complete the questionnaire(s)
In these instances, the coordinator may obtain patient responses by [CONTACT_90222], followed by [CONTACT_144979], and entering the patient’s 
response. No help should be provided to the patient by [CONTACT_144980]. The coordinator should not influence patient responses. The study 
coordinator cannot translate the question into simpler language and has to be read verbatim.
The patient wants someone else to complete the questionnaire(s)
In no case should the coordinator or anyone other than the patient provide responses to the 
questions. Unless specified in the study  protocol proxy data are notan acceptable substitute 
for patient self-report. Patients shoul d be discouraged from asking a family member or friend 
for help in completing a questionnaire.
The patient does not want to finish completing the questionnaire(s)
If non-completion is a result of the patient having trouble understanding particular items, ask 
the patient to explain the difficulty . Re-read the question for them verbatim , but do not 
rephrase the question. If the respondent is still unable to complete the questionnaire, accept it 
as incomplete. Thank the patient.
The patient is concerned that s omeone will look at his/her responses
Emphasize that all responses are to be kept confidential. Point out that their names do not 
appear anywhere on the questionnaire, so that their results will be linked with an ID number 
and not their name. Tell the patient that his/her answers will be pooled with other patients’ 
answers and that they will be analyzed as a group rather than as individuals. Tell the patient 
that completed forms are not routinely  shared with treating staff, and that their responses will
only be seen by [CONTACT_10825] (to check for completeness), and possibly  the investigator. Any response 
which may directly  impact on or reflect their medical condition (e.g. noting of severe 
depression) will be communicated b y the coordinator to the ph ysician.
The p atient asks the meaning of a question/item
While completing the questionnaire, some patients might ask the meaning of specific items so 
that they  can better understand and respond. If this happens, assist the patient by  [CONTACT_144981]. If the patient asks to interpret the meaning of an item, do not try 
to explain it, but suggest that he/she use his/her own interpretation of the question. Patients 
should answer the questions based on what they think the questions mean.

A General In formation about all questionnaire(s): 
All questionnaires need to be completed by [CONTACT_144982]. The 
questionnaires should be completed by [CONTACT_90227] a quiet area free from disturbance, and 
before any visit assessments. Patient s should receive no help from family  members; if 
questions cannot be answered alone (due to problems with reading or understanding), then the 
doctor or nurse should read the questions and record the patient’s responses without 
influencing their answers. The information provided is strictly  confidential and will be treated 
as such. If a patient has missed a question or given more than one response per question, then 
this should be brought to patient. Incomplete questions should not be accepted without first 
encouraging the patient to complete unanswered questions.
The investigator must complete the patient/visit information on the questionnaire and ensure 
that the center number, patient’s number and initials are identical to the Case Record Form. 
As there areno source data for this questionnaire, the data queries will be restricted to 
patient/visit information .

13.11 Appendix 1 1: Stud y design of core study  CAIN457F2306
The AIN457F230 6core study  used a double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo
controlled design. A screening period running 4 weeks before randomization was used to
assess eligibility  followed by  a treatment period of 2 y ears (Week 0 through Week 104) .
At baseline (BSL), eligible subject were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 
Group 1: Secukinumab i.v. (10mg/kg) at BSL, Weeks 2 and 4, then secukinumab 75 mg 
s.c. starting at Week 8 and injected every  4 weeks 
Group 2: Secukinumab i.v. (10mg/kg) at BSL, Weeks 2 and 4, then secukinumab 150 mg 
s.c. starting at Week 8 and injected every  4 weeks
Group 3: Placebo i.v. at BSL, Weeks 2 and 4, then placebo s.c. starting at Week 8 and 
Week 12
The subjects were stratified as either TNFα inhibitor incomplete responders (TNF -IR) or 
TNFα inhibitor naïve subjects. Approximately  30% of subjects were TNF-IR to ensure a 
representative population for the assessment of efficacy  and safet y.
At Week 16 (Visit 8), subjects were classified as responders ( ≥20% improvement from 
baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts) or non-responders. Subjects who were 
randomized to placebo at baseline were re-randomized by [CONTACT_144983] 2 y ears, as follows
Subjects on secukinumab placebo (Group 3) who were responders remain edon placebo 
until week 24. At Week 24, these subjects were 
re-randomized (1:1) to receive either 
secukinumab 75 or 150 mg every  4 weeks
Subjects on secukinumab placebo (Group 3) who were non-responders at Week 16 were 
re-randomized (1:1) to receive either secukinumab 75 mg or 150 mg s.c. every  4 weeks

Official Title: A Multimodel Examination of Bromocriptine on 
Homeostatic and Hedonic Mechanisms of Food Intake in Individuals 
at High Risk for Type 2 Diabetes  
 
Study ID: [REMOVED] 
 
Document Date: June 6, 2022 
 
Study Protocol 
 
A. Study Rationale 
 
Twenty -nine million Americans suffered from type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in 2012 (2014 National 
Diabetes Report), with fewer than half able to meet treatment goals and considerably more are at risk for development of T2DM (1). Implementation of healthy eating behavior has been identified as a barrier to T2DM treatment and efficacy ( 2). The determinants of eating behavior 
and weight regulation involve a complex interaction among individual -level homeostatic, 
hedonic, and genetic systems, and the external food environment ( 3,4). The high prevalence of 
obesity and T2DM suggests hedonic motivation to consume food overrides homeostatic satiation signaling, resulting in excess food intake. Elevated intake increases body mass and promotes T2DM incidence via dysregulation of GLP1, amylin, and adiponectin, which in turn can 
negatively impact T2DM treatment options. Use of a pharmaceutical, such as bromocriptine, to 
aid in behavioral change is a novel method for treating and ameliorating T2DM and warrants  
investigation given that previous work has shown reward response to food images mediates T2DM control ( 5). Use of fMRI techniques to predict and evaluate hedonically -motivated eating 
behavior can be used to measure sensitivity to reward, and the role it plays in developi[INVESTIGATOR_351035] (6,7), and is therefore an excellent tool to examine the associations among 
bromocriptine, satiety hormones, reward sensitivity and eating behavior. Moreover, since 20 35% of the population carries the DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele (8 ), and 65% of the population is 
overweight or obese and at high risk for T2DM development or currently diagnosed, as much as 23% of the population may greatly benefit from dopamine agonist treatment ( 9). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_351036] T2DM treatment or as prevention 
therapy in those that are genetically predisposed, few data are available that directly examine 
the three systems (homeostatic, hedonic, genetic) available to assess whether a genetically -
informed, personalized T2DM treatment is viable.  
 
B. Study Objectives 
 
Aim 1 : To test the hypothesis that acute bromocriptine administration will alter neural and 
perceptual hedonic drivers of eating behavior (Visual analog scales), both contributing to a 
decrease in palatable food intake in those at high risk for T2DM. We expect that bromocriptine 
will increase BOLD response during palatable food intake in dopaminergic brain regions thought 
to encode reward and increase perceptual hedonic food ratings. We also expect that 
bromocriptine will result in decreased ad lib palatable food intake.  
 
Aim 2 : Test whether the A1 variant of the DRD2 TaqIA polymorphism, which is associated with 
reduced dopamine-D2 receptor density and dopamine signaling, moderates the impact of 
bromocriptine on neural and perceptual hedonic drivers of eating behavior. By [CONTACT_351042], we expect that the effects described in aim [ADDRESS_436263] 1 A1 variant of the TaqIA polymorphism.  
 
Exploratory Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that acute bromocriptine administration will alter the  
homeostatic mechanisms of satiation (meal termination) . We expect bromocriptine to modify 
endocrine-mediated satiation signaling via suppressed prolactin, augmented adiponectin, 
amylin, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP1), and decrease postprandial plasma glucose and insulin. 
    
C. Study Design 
 
This within-subject pi[INVESTIGATOR_351037] 180 overweight/obese (25 < BMI < 35) adults ages 18-
[ADDRESS_436264] the A2/A2 variant. The study will be completed over two testing visits with a two-week washout period in between. Following published reports of the effect of acute administration of bromocriptine ( 10), participants will be given a 1.6mg dose of either bromocriptine-QR 
(Cycloset) or a placebo after a 6-[ADDRESS_436265], paralleling the recommended dosage and time of administration ( 11). O rder of agonist/placebo will be counterbalanced across the two visits. At 
both visits, the participant will have a fasting blood draw, anthropometric measurements, complete visual analogue scales (VAS) for hunger, and satiety and surveys. Once bromocriptine/placebo is metabolically active (~60 mins) subjects will undergo a functional MRI 
with our milkshake receipt paradigm and a resting state MRI to assess functional connectivity. 
The Biomedical Research Imaging Center (BRIC) is located on the UNC -CH campus  and 7-10 
min walk from our laboratory (Neuropsychology of Ingestive Behavior Laboratory). Post-MRI, subjects will consume a fixed portion of milkshake (12 fl oz) and perform VAS hedonic ratings; will complete a test of reaction time and behavioral impulsivity, and two postprandial blood 
draws (30 & 60mins post milkshake ingestion). Finally, subjects will perform perceptual hedonic 
assessments of palatable foods and given the opportunity for ad lib consumption.  
D. Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Subjects 
 
For each participant, the study will include three visits on three separate days. Total study duration will be approximately two years.  
We will recruit and screen 180, 18-35-year -old overweight/obese individuals in order to enroll 50 
participants with and without the presence of the DRD2 TaqIA A1 allele, and at high risk for 
T2DM by [CONTACT_351043]1c. The n=42 represents the number of participants who will provide 
usable data and accounts for possible attrition and negative side effects of the bromoc riptine 
(based on previous repeated measures fMRI studies and reports of bromocriptine, expected attrition is 4%-7%). 
 
E. Study Population 
 
50 overweight/obese (25 < BMI < 35) adults ages 18-[ADDRESS_436266] the 
A2/A2 variant. We will exclude participants who report current: a) contraindications of fMRI (e.g., metal implants, braces, or serious medical problems [e.g., known diabetes, CVD, recent stroke]), b) any previous habitual use of cigarettes or illicit drugs, or c) current major psychiatric disorders (depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder), d) 
pregnancy or breastfeeding e) current weight loss dieting and/or weight fluctuations great than 
10 lbs in the previous 6 weeks. f) do not consume dairy e) allergy to bromocriptine, dairy, and nuts. Diabetes status will be assessed via self-report.  
F. Study Procedures 
 
1. Screening Visit  
At the screening visit, following consent, the potential participant will be weighed and height will be measured to ensure they are overweight (25 < BMI < 35). A brief screener for  identifying MRI 
contraindications will be administered before inviting subjects to join the MRI portion of the 
study, as done in prior fMRI studies. If participants satisfy inclusion and exclusion criteria during 
the screen, they will be scheduled for the testing assessments. Female participants will be 
asked to self-report the date of their last menstruation to ensure they are in the follicular phase and are not pregnant (pregnancy test will be offered). Saliva (genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and blood glucose values (mg/dL) will be collected from consented participants at the initial screening appointment. (30 minutes)

G. Study Evaluations and Measurements 
 
Bromocriptine/placebo administration 
Participants will be given either bromocriptine (1.6mg Cycloset) or placebo at each testing visit. Order of bromocriptine/placebo will be counterbalanced across the participants. The researcher and participant will be blinded to the treatment given. [CONTACT_271201], [CONTACT_351051], and IDS will have the randomization key. The research assistant will pi[INVESTIGATOR_351038]. He or she will be blinded to the contents (whether placebo or Cycloset) and will give the participant the 
capsule to take orally. To allow the drug to reach maximum plasma concentration, participants 
will be scanned approximately [ADDRESS_436267] blood draw (fasting) will occur at the start of the visit and the second and third will occur 30mins and 60mins after the fixed milkshake portion (after fMRI scan; see Fig 1). This will allow us to assess fasted 
circulating hormone levels and gives us the ability to examine satiation hormone fluctuation over 
two time points that encompass the entirety of the previously characterized GLP1 peak in 
serum. A trained phlebotomist will perform the blood draws. The phlebotomist will try no more than 3 times unless the participant consents to further attempt. Blood samples for satiety hormones will be assayed using Bio- Plex Pro Human Diabetes 7-plex Assay (Bio -rad, Hercules, 
CA). This kit analyzes adiponectin, amylin, and GLP1. Additionally, a custom Human Cancer Panel 1 with only prolactin will be used to analyze prolac tin concentrations (Bio-rad, Hercules, 
CA) using a Millipore Luminex (Darmstadt, [LOCATION_013]). All samples will be kept at -80° until processed. Our team is well versed in blood processing procedures and Luminex operation.  
  
Height and Weight 
Height and weight will be measured without shoes or heavy clothing.  
  
Visual Analogue Scale  
Visual Analogue Scales will be used to assess hunger, fullness, thirst, and nausea periodically throughout the testing visits. These will be distributed via iPad on Qualtrics software. 
  
Neuroimaging Paradigms  
Participants will complete 2 functional MRI paradigms: milkshake receipt paradigm and resting 
state paradigm, in addition to an anatomical scan. These paradigms examine different aspects of neural functioning. First, the milkshake receipt paradigm allows us to examine how the brain responds during exposure to a primary reward (receipt of highly palatable taste) and a tasteless control. Second, the steady state paradigm will allow for functional connectivity analyses to examine reward and behavioral differences in the brain at ‘rest’.  
  
Milkshake receipt fMRI paradigm  
The paradigm is controlled by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-house Python scripts. Each trial in the paradigm starts with the presentation of a cue (duration: 1s) signaling the impending delivery of either 3 mL of highly palatable milkshake or a control water solution over a period of 6s. Taste delivery is followed by 
a 1s wait period and 2s rinse (tasteless solution). The next trial begins after a 1-9s jitter. Order 
of milkshake and water trials is pseudo randomized. In total, there are [ADDRESS_436268] (milkshake) and control (water solution) as well as in vivo neuroadaptations over repeated exposures.  
 
Resting state functional connectivity  
We will use resting state fMRI data for functional connectivity analyses to provide data about brain functioning and connectivity. Functional connectivity is assessed by [CONTACT_351044] “resting” brain and is 
thought to provide a measure of its functional organization Steady -state fMRI data will be 
acquired in one run of 5 minutes; participants will be asked to remain still and relaxed and stay awake during the scanning. This paradigm allows us to assess the brain’s functional connectivity. We hypothesize that connectivity from the hypothalamus will be significantly altered by [CONTACT_351045]. 
Total scan time will be approximately 50 minutes.   
Behavioral impulsivity task  
We will use a basic stop -signal task that assesses behavioral inhibitory control in response to 
palatable food images, adapted from Batterink and colleagues ( 12) and in current use in our lab. 
This task requires subjects to respond to “go” signals and occasionally inhibit responses to “no-
go” signals. It measures the ability to inhibit a pre -potent tendency to respond. The task consists 
of 80 trials, evenly split between left-button responses (the letter A) and right-button responses (the letter Z). 16 total stop trials are presented (the stop signal is the letter X). The stop signal delay begins at 200ms, and increments by [CONTACT_351046]. The number of responses to stop signal stimuli (commission errors) will be used 
to provide a behavioral measure of inhibition failure. 
  
Ad lib taste test 
After the fMRI scan and fixed consumption of milkshake, participants undergo the postprandial 
blood draw and perform a taste test which includes perceptual hedonic ratings of a variety of 
foods and an ad lib intake challenge. Participants first perform a taste test of 1g of each of the 4 foods (M&Ms, Skittles, Doritos, cheddar popcorn). These foods were selected as they are generally considered highly palatable and represent a variety of flavors, mouth feels and nutrient contents (e.g., sugar, fat, salt). Participants complete perceptual hedonic ratings of the 
pleasantness, sweetness, taste intensity, and desire to consume on generalized, l abeled 
magnitude scales of each of the foods. After the taste test, participants will be told that they are 
free to eat as many snacks as they like, as we have to discard them after each participant (they will not be allowed to have backpacks, purses, or bags, so they do not take snacks from the room). Participants will be left alone during the tasting to minimize demand characteristics. Food will be pre- and post-weighed to determine ad lib intake. Total caloric intake will be calculated 
and translated to % of calorie needs using gender -specific formulas (NAS, 2005). We currently 
use these techniques (NORC5-[ZIP_CODE], HHSN275201300015C). 
  
Eating Attitudes  
The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ; 13) is a 46-item questionnaire with three 
subscales measuring restrained, external, and emotional eating. Responses are recorded on a 
5-point Likert scale. These three scales demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80 – 0.95), interrelationships between scales, and factorial validity. 
  
Food Craving  
The Food Craving Inventory (FCI) will assess the degree of craving for high- and low-fat/sugar 
foods (14). This scale has shown internal consistency ( α= .93), 2-week test-retest reliability (r = 
.86), and sensitivity to detecting change. 
  
Self-re port Impulsivity  
The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS -15) is a 15-item self-report assessment that will measure 
attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsivity ( 15). This scale has shown internal consistency 
(α=.81), 2-week test-retest reliability (r =.88), and discriminates between psychiatric patients and 
controls (56).   
Acute and Habitual Dietary Intake 
Participants will complete our adapted version of the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire 
(Block FFQ) which inquiries about the frequency of consumption of [ADDRESS_436269] 2 weeks (16) to measure habitual dietary intake. Food frequency questionnaires are the 
most practical and economical method for collecting dietary intake data in large studies ( 17). 
Block FFQ values correlated (r = .57) with 4-day food record estimates for energy and most 
nutrients (18 ). We have successfully used this version in previous studies (NORC5-[ZIP_CODE], 
HHSN275201300015C) and published results.  
  
Additional Surveys  
We will administer the Short-Form International Physi cal Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), which 
queries about physical activity over the previous days and has shown strong reliability (r = .80; (19)). Participants will also complete a modified version of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272], which will ask about sleep quality over the past week  (20), which we can determine the previous 
night’s sleep. Lastly, participants will complete the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, which is a continuous measure of hand dominance (21). 
  
All Surveys will be administered via an iPad using Qualtrics software and applications. 
 
H. Study Intervention  
 
- Bromocriptine-QR cycloset; 1.6mg; once; oral  
- Placebo; 2 capsules; once; oral  
Participants will be administered two placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_351039] a two 0.8mg dose of 
bromocriptine at the other visit. Bromocriptine dose agrees with optimal dose according to clinical trials ( 22,10). Adverse effects related to bromocriptine include nausea, dizziness, 
fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and constipation ( 11). However, adverse events (AEs) are 
generally not severe; according to Scranton & Cincotta, 17% subjects on bromocriptine reported adverse drugs experiences as severe, while 14% on placebo reported AEs as severe ( 22). 
Moreover, the most commonly reported adverse event, nausea, was not reported as severe (22). To prevent any potential adverse interactions with bromocriptine, participants will be asked to abstain from any drugs for 12 hours before the assessment including over the counter 
pharmaceuticals such as (ex. Advil, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Benadryl), and for the remainder of the day after the 
session. Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol for 24 hours after bromocriptine administration to prevent increased risk of drowsiness. Bromocriptine may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, female participants taking oral contraceptives will be asked 
to refrain from intercourse for 24 hours or to use an additional form of birth control. Because the 
half-life for bromocriptine is 6 hours after 24 hours the amount of active drug in the participant’s 
system will have decreased 98%.  
 
I. Study Intervention Administration 
 
This is a within subjects designed experiment, so all subjects will receive the Cycloset and 
placebo. The administration will be blinded to subject and the research. [CONTACT_271201] will oversee 
the blinding procedure. The order of the drug and placebo will be counterbalanced across the two visits, and [CONTACT_271201] will see to the drug/placebo administration schedule. Because the screening visit is before the testing visit and randomization we are confident in the participant's eligibility.  
 
J. Safety Management  
It is possible that the questionnaires may cause distress or embarrassment to the participants. One potential risk to participants is that it may be distressing to disclose information about 
psychiatric difficulties. In our estimation, there is a low risk of this possibility and the effects 
would probably be short-lived. We have conducted several thousand of these types of 
interviews with no adverse events. We will take steps to minimize this risk by [CONTACT_351047]. Additionally, it is possible someone maybe embarrassed to be weighed. The research staff will be trained to be highly professional for the entire study visit. Data will be obtained from participants through surveys, taste assessments, height and weight 
measurements, fMRI scans, blood draws, and saliva. There is a slight risk that these research records might be obtained by [CONTACT_351048]. There is also a risk that 
participants may not understand the limits of confidentiality (i.e. that we will not keep certain 
information confidential, such as spontaneous disclosures on their part regarding suicidal ideation and child abuse [no measures inquire about sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_351040]]). Data for all participants will be kept strictly confidential, except as mandated by [CONTACT_2371]. All research files will be kept in locked file cabinets in a locked room in a locked building. Participants will be 
assigned a numeri cal code for identification in the files. Names and other identifiers will be kept 
in separate locked files and will never be recorded on any data forms. Statistical analyses will 
be performed on aggregate-level data; participants are never individually named. All entered data will be kept on the password protected, secured computers or networks at the research site. These data will be accessible only to research staff, using confidential usernames and 
passwords. All staff on this project will receive training in the ethical conduct of research with 
human participants prior to contact [CONTACT_351049]. Participants will be informed in detail about the limits of confidentiality, including disclosure of intentions to inflict harm to self or others and the possibility that we might break confidentiality to report suspected child or elder abuse. All participants will be told that participation is voluntary and that they may terminate their involvement at any time without any consequences. If, during any assessment, 
the project coordinator determines that a participant has developed a serious health problem, 
efforts will be made to help the participant access appropriate treatment as quickly as possible. In addition, any scans that suggest possible problems are sent to a radiologist for a consult. In the event of a potential problem, [CONTACT_271201] will meet with the participant and the radiologist to discuss the findings, per protocol from the Biomedical Research Imaging Center. 
 
K. Data Collection and M anagement  
 
All paper data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a locked room. All digital data will be stored on servers which require passwords to access. Data will be saved as confidential, coded files. All blood data and genetic data will be de-identified and will be kept in secure freezers until 
it is assayed. 
 Only authorized project staff will have access to the information gathered for this project. We will follow established data handling procedures as follows: (a) data will be reported in aggregate form only; (b) all data will be kept in locked file cabinets and/or in password-protected computer 
files; and (c) all personnel interacting with participants and having access to data are trained in 
confidentiality procedures.  Any paper documents  will be stored in locked files, behind locked doors at the laboratory on 
campus at UNC -CH. The key that links participant names to the identification numbers will be 
kept separate from the data, also in a locked file.  
 fMRI data collected at the BRIC is sent over a secured server (PACS), this data is attached to coded numbers. fMRI data is accessed through this password protected served and transferred to the lab's protected databases. Unprotected personal information of subjects is never sent over the web. 
 
L. Recruitment Strategy 
 
Recruitment posters will be placed on the UNC campus, in community centers, and restaurants in local Chapel Hill/Durham area. Additionally, we will use the ‘UNC -Chapel Hill Biomedical 
Research Imaging Center (BRIC) Database’ (UNC -CH IRB #13-0959) and the ‘Join the 
Conquest’ (UNC -CH IRB #13-1768) recruitment databases. These and similar approaches have 
been successfully used for recruitment in this sampling frame (e.g., R01DK092468, NORC5-
[ZIP_CODE]). Those interested in participating will be directed to the screening website. Information 
needed to determine participant eligibility will be obtained via web, phone or in person (see attached prescreening material). The subjects will be contact[CONTACT_351050] (phone, email, in person) to provide the consent for review and schedule the first assessment (if applicable).  
 
M. Consent Process 
 If the potential participant is interested in the study they will be scheduled for a screening visit and a consent form will be mailed or emailed to them. At the screening visit, before an 
assessments, the consent form will be reviewed, all answers regarding study expectations  
will be answered, and consent will be confirmed by [CONTACT_3665] (listed in the personnel 
section of the application). Consenting will be performed in a private room.

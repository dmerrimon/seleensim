Safety Asse ssments  A review and assessment of all device -related Adverse Events (AE) 
collected retrospectively via chart review, and any prospective device -
related AE that occur from the time of subject consent until the time of 
study exit.  
 Statistics  The primary e ffectiveness endpoint s are the improvement in aided hearing 
from unaided hearing by [CONTACT_386153] 2 MPO processor. This 
endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_386154] (samples) t -test or 
Wilcoxon signed rank sum test according to the normal or non -normal 
distribution as appropriate . 
The primary safety endpoint is an assessment of all AEs  (prospective or 
retrospective)  that are directly attributable to the Sophono device (implant 
or processor). This endpoint will be the proportion of event s reported with  
confidence interval (95%) .  
 
  

Clinical Inves tigation Plan  Page [ADDRESS_483882] become increasingly popular for the 
restoration of various types of hearing loss  (HL) in the adult and pediatric populations. Though t he idea 
of bone -conduction for sound amplification has been known and studied since the Renaissance, the 
concept of a device  fully implanted within bone was not developed until the 1970s .(1) 
Percutaneous devices have been successfully used to treat conductive hearing loss  (CHL)  both in adult 
and in pediatric patients .(2–4)  Percutaneous devices have  the advantage of direct transmission of 
vibrations through  the bone, thus providing optimal  hearing gain; however,  their drawbacks include the 
need for osseointegration, risk  of local infection, soft tissue overgrowth and poor aesthetic outcome.  
It has been demonstrated that children with these percutaneous implants are more prone to adverse 
events (AEs)  (e.g. skin reactions and [traumatic]  implant loss ) compared with adults .(5–7)  Recent data 
show that children experience adverse skin reactions in 7.8% of the  implant cases , and 15.2% of these  
percutaneous implants  are lost in children .(8) 
Therefore , a device system that provides bone conduction  (BC) hearing while the skin remains intact is 
ideal and such transcutaneous devices (e.g. Sophono Alpha 2 and Alpha 2 Maximum Power Output 
(MPO)) are currently  the subject of new research and optimization.  
In 1986, Hough et al.  (9) introduced the first transcutaneous concept, the Temporal Bone Stimulator, 
also termed the Xomed -Audiant device (Audiant). This device system contained a  permanent magnet that 
was implanted in the temporal bone and covered by a thin layer of skin. Sound vibrations were 
transferred transcutaneously by [CONTACT_386155]. 
Consequently, the implanted magnet w as part of the actuator of the Audiant device. The external coil 
was powered by [CONTACT_386156] a behind -the-ear housing or in a larger, bodyworn housing. The major 
disadvantage of this configuration was the relatively wide distance between the implanted m agnet and 
the external driving coil  (10); resultantly, gain and maximum output were low  (11) and significantly 
worse compared with that of the percutaneous alternative .(10) Additionally, the clinical outcomes of the 
Audiant were less favorable (12), and the device  was withdrawn from the market.  
In 2005, Siegert developed the Otomag BC hearing device , a transcutaneous BC implant that uses dual 
magnets implanted snugly onto the temporal bone with five screws.  T he sound processor attaches to the 
skin with a magnetic base plate that is available in a variety of strength s to provide options for 

Clinical Inves tigation Plan  Page 14 of 52

Confidential  
 attachment strength. Siegert reported no major complications in over 100 patients related to implantation 
and only minor s kin reactions which resolved after adjusting the forces of the magnets. (13,14) 
The Otomag device was purchased by [CONTACT_386157] 2010 and became commercially known as the Sophono 
Alpha 1 System;  the system has gone thro ugh a series of upgrades to the sound processor (Alpha 2 and 
Alpha 2 MPO) while the implant with  dual magnets remains relatively unchanged since the inception  
(note: Otomag will hereafter be referred to as “Sophono™”) .  Bench audiogram research and ancilla ry 
data presented at society meetings  indicate an improved feedback free gain from the Alpha 2 MPO 
device; however, to date no studies have been published.   The Sophono Company  was acquired by 
[CONTACT_54452] 201 5.  
The aim of this study is to examine the  long-term (implant duration three months or longer)  audiologic, 
safety , and quality of life (QOL) outcomes of subjects implanted with the Sophono bone conduction 
hearing implant  and to compare the Alpha [ADDRESS_483883] -market  clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of the Sophono Alpha 2 and 
Alpha 2 MPO systems .

7.1. Duration  
It is anticipated this study will conclude within [ADDRESS_483885].  This 
estimation is based on the following assumptions:  [ADDRESS_483886] e nrollment /participation , [ADDRESS_483887] Description  
8.1. General  
The Sophono Bone Conduction Hearing Systems are a family of sound processors and accessories that 
operate on the principle of BC of sound vibrations.  The Sophono Bone Conduction Hearing Systems

 transmits audio vibrations through the skin into the bone where soun d is sensed by [CONTACT_386160]/cochlea.  
The Sophono  Sound Processor  is magnetically attracted to the Magnetic Implant and Magnetic Spacer.  
The Magnetic Implant , which is secured to the skull bone,  affixes the  Magnetic Spacer to the head 
transcutaneously through magnetic attraction forces, and the Sound Processor  is magnetically affixed to 
the Magneti c Spacer.  Vibration from the Sound Processor is transduced through the Magnetic Spacer to 
the Magnetic Implant  and through the bone to the inner ear.  
 
Figure [ADDRESS_483888]® Magnetic Spacer  comes in various  strengths.  The appropriate strength for daily wear is  
recommended by [CONTACT_386161]. The resul ts of the hearing tests 
with these magnets are out of scope of this study.   
8.1.1.  Magnetic Implant  
The Sophono Magnetic Implant is comprised of

 it to the bone.  The implant provides magnetic retention through the skin to a magnetic spacer, which in 
turn holds the audio processor.  
8.1.2.  Magnetic Spacer  
The Sophono Magnetic Spacer is an externally worn component tha t magnetically couples the Sophono 
Sound processor to the Sophono magnetic implant. The Magnetic Spacers also contain  
  Spacers are available 
in a range of magneti c strengths. They are labeled with “dots” to note the magnetic strength (1 -dot 
represents a lower magnetic strength; 5 -dots represent  a higher magnetic strength). The strength is also 
indicated by [CONTACT_386162] (as shown in Figure  1). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a processor is 
shipped with five spacers (dots 1 through 5). Other spacers (both weaker and stronger) are also 
available.  
8.1.3.  Sound Processors  
The Sophono Processor is an audio processor that converts sound into mechanical vibrations. Sound 
enters the audio processor through the microphones, which then goes through  
 
 
he vibrations are carried through the patient’s skin and skull to the cochlea where 
they are perceived as sound.  The Sophono Sound Processors have a simple user interface with a 
combined  on/off  and volume switch wheel, and a push button switch that allows the user to swap 
between four programmable settings configured by [CONTACT_386163].

Figure [ADDRESS_483898]’s unwillingness to participate will be 
documented  in the Subject Screening /Enrollment  Log.   
10.3.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
No change in medicati on is required for this study, nor will any additional  medications be required. 
Medications will not be collected unless relevant to a n AE.  
10.4.  Subject Consent  
Prior to study enrollment and before any study visits are initiated, all subjects must document the ir 
consent by [CONTACT_386166]. The Study Investigator or his/her authorized 
designee will conduct the informed consent process during which the subject will have the opportunity to 
ask questions and receive answers about the s tudy. Subjects will be made aware that the study includes 
a medical chart review, as well as an in -office follow -up visit, and they should be willing to comply with 
the study requirements to be available for study  visits. If they decide not to come in for the in -office 
follow -up visit the data from the medical chart review will still be used in data analysis.  
 
A copy of the signed IC and Research Authorization will be provided to the subject, and the original 
signed version will be retained in the site’s st udy files. The site will record the date of consent in the 
CRFs.  
 
Obtaining data from a subject’s medical chart or a follow -up visit without obtaining informed consent is a 
protocol violation and is to be recorded in the Protocol Deviation CRF and reporte d to the Sponsor, as 
well as the respective IRB/IEC as soon as possible, but no later than five (5) working days after 
the event occurred, or sooner if required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC .   
10.5.  Randomization and Treatment Assignment  
There is no randomization in this stud y as bias is expected to be negligible .  All subjects will undergo 
testing with two (2) processors and a blank  in the order given below  (Table 3) .  

Clinical Inves tigation Plan  Page [ADDRESS_483899] Quality Experience Group  as required by [CONTACT_19124] . 
Prospective data collection will be from the date of signed IC, and wil l be reported to  Medtronic’s Product 
Quality Experience Group and  the IRBs per Institutional reporting requirements.   
10.7.  Recording Data  
Data will be recorded on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system, Oracle Clinical.   For the retrospective portion of the study medical charts, operative notes, and 
other medical records will be considered as the source documents.  For the prospective portion of the 
study, CRFs can be used as source for this study  as well as medical char ts. Source document worksheets 
will be provided to the sites if requested.  
10.8.  Deviation  Handling  
It is expected that the Investigator will adhere to the protocol and not deviate unless medically necessary 
in response to an emergency situation to protect the r ights, safety and well -being of the subject.  
Planned deviations may be submitted to the Sponsor in advance for review and approval, as nec essary.  
Protocol deviations  that occur  will be documented on the Protocol Deviation CRF  and reported to the IRB 
based on the IRB schedule . 

Clinical Inves tigation Plan   Page [ADDRESS_483900] to follow -up. The types o f attempts 
(phone, email, text, mail) will also be captured on the Study Exit CRF. Note : retrospective  safety  data 
collected may still be used in the study.  
11. Risks and Benefits  
11.1.  Potential Risks  
The risks for this study are minimal.  Risks inherent to use of the Sophono system  or surgical procedure 
are outlined in the potential AEs found in Section 12.  
11.2.  Potential Benefits  
There may not be any direct medical benefits to the study subjects . This study will help the Sponsor 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of  the hearing system  to develop future products to assist  others 
with similar hearing impairment.  Subjects will be reimbursed for their participation.  
11.3.  Risk-Benefit Rationale  
As the ris ks to this study are minimal  (limited to subject inconvenience ), the bene fits of the increased 
data portfolio  on the safety and processor effectiveness  outweigh the associated risks.

 12. Adverse Event Assessments  
12.1.  Definitions/Classifications  
The below definitions are standard ISO regulation definitions required for all Medtronic studies. These 
definitions are given with the understanding that the Sophono device is an approved device and not 
considered investigational.   
Adverse Event  
(ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, 3.2)  Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward c linical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in  
subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device.  
 
Note: This definition includes events related to the investigational 
medical device or the comparator . 
 
Note: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
Note: for users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events 
related to investigational medical devices.  
Adverse Device Effect  
(ADE)  
(ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, 3.1)  Adverse ev ent related to the use of an investigational medical device.  
 
Note: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient 
or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, 
installation, or operation or any malfunction of the inves tigational 
medical device.  
 
Note: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
Serious Adverse Event  
(SAE)  
(ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, 3.37)  Adverse event that:  
a) Led to a death,  
b) Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject,  that either 
resulted in:  
1) Resulted in a life threatening illness or injury, or  

Clinical Inves tigation Plan  Page 30 of 52 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed copi[INVESTIGATOR_386148].  
Confidential  
 2) Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body 
function, or  
3) In-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298], or  
4) Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, 
or Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.  
 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, or a 
procedure required by [CONTACT_10396], without serious deterioration in health, 
is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Serious Adverse Device  
Effect (SADE)  
(ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, 3.36)  Adverse device effect that ha s resu lted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
 
Information regarding any reportable AEs and outlined in Tables 4 & 5 below,  in relation to the device or 
the procedure (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) that occur during  the study will be recorded.  This 
information will include, at a minimum, the date of the event, the seriousness of the event  (prospective) , 
the severity, actions taken, the outcome, and the relation ship (if any) of the event to the device.  Subject 
continuation in the study as prescribed in this protocol following an AE is anticipated , unless determined 
otherwise by [CONTACT_737].  
12.1.1.  Classification of adverse events  
SEVERITY OF EVENT  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_386167].  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.

Confidential  
 RELATIONSHIP OF DEVICE  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study device is part of the documentation process, 
but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the e vent should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship 
to study device assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. To help assess, 
the following guidelines are used.  
Not related:   relationship to the device or procedures  can be excluded when:  
• the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device  belongs to or of similar 
devices and procedures;  
• the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the  investigational device or the 
procedures;  
• the serious  event does not follow a known response pattern to the  medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known) and is  biologically implausible;  
• the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the  level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the 
level of activation/exposure),  do not impact on the serious event;  
• the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected  by [CONTACT_10398];  
• the serious eve nt can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  or concurrent illness/ 
clinical condition, an effect of another device,  drug, treatment or other risk factors);  
• the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_386168] f or 
diagnosis , when applicable;  
• harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error;  
• In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above  might be met at the 
same time, depending on the type of  device/procedures and the serious eve nt. 
Unlikely:   the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or  the event can be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional  information may be obtained.  
Possible:   the relationship with the use of the investigational device is weak but  cannot be ruled out 
completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an  underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical 
condition or/and an effect of another  device, drug or treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no  informati on has been obtained should also be classified as possible.

Confidential  
 Probable:   the relationship with the use of the investigational device seems  relevant and/or the event 
cannot reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but  additional information may be obtained.  
Causal relationship:   the serious event is associated with the investigational  device or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when:  
• the event is a known side effect of the product category the device  belongs to or of similar 
devices and procedures;  
• the eve nt has a temporal relationship with investigational device  use/application or procedures;  
• the event involves a body -site or organ that  
• the investigational device or procedures are applied to;  
• the investigational device or procedures have an effect on;  
• the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical  device (if the response 
pattern is previously known);  
• the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the  level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or incre ase of  the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when  clinically feasible);  
• other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical  condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment) have  been adequatel y ruled out;  
• harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
• the event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_386169] , when 
applicable;  
• In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above  might be met at t he same 
time, depending on the type of  device/procedures and the serious event.  
Where the relationship remains uncertain , it should not exclude the relatedness and  the event should be 
classified  as “possible”.  
EXPECTEDNESS  
An anticipated adverse event is d efined as an AE, the nature, severity, or degree of incidence of which is 
known and identified in applicable product labeling, published literature or the Investigational Plan or 
Informed Consent.   
Based on event  reports through literature review  (15-19) anticipated Surgical Related AE’s  possibly noted 
in the Operative Report during the retrospective medical chart review should be reported on the 
appropriate CRF.  These events  may include:

12.2.  Reporting of Adverse Events  
Clinical information on AEs (as defined above), their presentation, date of event, management, 
relationship and outcome must be reported on a CRF and sent to Medtronic.  Subjects with ongoing AEs 
at the time of the prospective visit may not exit the study until the AE has been  resolved or is determined  
not able to  be resolved.  As this is a post -market study of a marketed device the sponsor and investigator 
will comply with  regulations on event reporting according to the Medical Device Reporting System (MDR). 
The designated study personnel will have two opportunities to col lect AE’s for each subject:  
At the retrospective data collection of Sophono implantation and post -implantation, any surgical 
procedure or device related AE will be recorded on the applicable CRF. This data collection may occur at 
any time after the subject  consents to the study. No safety reporting to IRBs will be required for 
retrospective events.  
At the follow -up visit, the designated study personnel will examine and query the subject on the 
experience of any AEs, and designated study personnel will recor d data on the applicable CRF.  This data 
collection may occur at any time after the subject consents to the study. These prospective observed 
events will be reported to IRBs or other committees according to the rules and timeframe of the 
governing site or IRB. 
No AEs will be collected after the subject exits the study.

 13. Statistical Design and Methods  
13.1.  Sample size  
Since the primary endpoint is composed of a safety and efficacy endpoint, the sample  was determined by 
[CONTACT_386170]. A n approximate  total of 100 
subjects  will be enrolled . 
Sample size on safety  
The sample size calculation was estimated using data from previous studies with a prec ision-based 
calculation.  (20, 21 )  Recent data have shown th at 15.2% of percutaneous implants are lost  in children 
and adverse skin reactions  were found in 7.8 % during  follow -up visits . (21) Using this information and 
assuming a lower incidence of implant los s in transcutaneous devices (19, 22, 23)  and a lower inc idence 
of skin reaction  (18, 24), a minimum incidence of 14% of any a dverse event s with a sample size of 72 
subjects  will be able to obtain a 9 5% confidence level with a precision of +/ - 9% (ranging from 5% to 
23%).  Considering a 25% withdrawal  or potenti al dropout  rate, a total of approximately  [ADDRESS_483901] shown an average 
of 50% improvement on hearing measured as PTA .(13, 20, 21 , 25-34) In the paper of Siegert  (34) the 
mean and standard d eviation of pure tone audiometry  in 21 patients was  58.7± 8.2 dB HL unaided and 
29.7± 8.2 dB HL  aided . Based on these values , alpha level 5%, power 95% and two -sided test, a total of 
6 paired subjects  are needed.  
13.2.  Data analysis and reporting  
A detailed desc ription of the statistical methods will be contained in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Any 
change to the data analysis methods described in this section and/or the Statistical Analysis Plan will 
require an amendment only if it changes a principal feature o f the study description. Any other changes 
to the data analysis methods will be described and justified in the Final Report or publication.  
It is anticipated that SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) will be used to perform all statistical 
analyses. Sta tistical tests will be based on a two -sided significance level of 0.05. No adjustments for 

Clinical Inves tigation Plan  Page [ADDRESS_483902] of the sample size, numbers of missing data and valid data, the 
frequency and the percentage of each category. Denominators for calculation of percentages will be 
taken as the number of subjects with avai lable (not missing or unknown) observations in the specified 
patients sets and groups unless otherwise stated. Percentages will be presented with no decimal.  For 
continuous variables, the description will consist at least of the sample size (N), number of  subjects with 
non-missing observation (n), mean, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, median and maximum. 
For n<3, only mean, minimum and maximum will be displayed. In general, minimums and maximums will 
be presented to the same level of accuracy as the raw data; means and medians will be presented to [ADDRESS_483903]; if appropriate, standard deviation and standard error will be presented to 2 further 
decimal places.  
The primary analysis is based on safety and effectiveness.  
13.3.  Safety endpoint   
Event rates, weighted for center, will be displayed together with their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) ; 
for each possible sub -group , analys es will be compared by [CONTACT_3553] a mixed Poisson model, with center 
included as random effect. In the presence of o ver dispersion, negative binomial regression will be used. 
Over dispersion will be assessed both with a goodness -of-fit test and a likelihood ratio test for alpha=0. 
The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95%CI will be reported [IRR=rate group1 / rate group2].  The 
exposure time ( days/ months) will be computed from implantation  to the date of the follow -up visit for  
each patient [(data end – data in)/30.4].  

Clinical Inves tigation Plan  Page [ADDRESS_483904]  where appropriate . The exposure time (months) will be computed from the 
date of the implant ation to the date of the last availa ble fol low-up or date of event:  [(data end – data 
in)/30.4].  
13.4.  Effectiveness endpoint  
The change between unaided and aided measurements  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_386154] (samples) t -
test or Wilcoxon signed rank sum test according to the normal or non -normal dis tribution or Mc Nemar 
test for categorical variables where appropriate. Categorical variable comparisons will be performed using 
a Chi-square test or a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test for trend for ordinal variables with 3 or more 
categories. The mean change w ill be displayed together with their 95% confidence interval (95%CI).  
Analysis of secondary endpoints based on comparisons between groups on continuous measurements will 
be performed by [CONTACT_15914]’s t -test or non -parametric test (Mann –Whitney U test) for nor mal and non -
normal distributions, respectively. Normality will be assessed by [CONTACT_386171][INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilks test and the p -
value will be reported.  Analysis of secondary endpoints based on  the change over time ( if more than 3 
measurements ) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8477] s of GEE models or mixed models for continuous outcomes to 
account for repeated measures using patient as the subject. The dependent variable will be pre -log 
transformed depending on normal or non -normal distribution. The model will have the clinical outco mes 
as dependent variables and baseline values, visits and other covariates as explanatory variables. All 
assumptions for regression models will be assessed by [CONTACT_386172]. The plot for 
the mean change over time will be reported.

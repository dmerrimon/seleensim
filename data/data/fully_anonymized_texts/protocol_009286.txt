1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
Primary Objectives:    
1)  Evaluate the safety of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  and the ability to detect tumors using PET 
imaging in patients with HER2  positive esophagogastric (EG) cancer  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12)

 2)  Determine the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics in normal organs and tumor of 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  in patients with esophagogastric cance r, and perform dosimetry estimates based on 
the data . 
Secondary Objectives:  
1) Evaluate changes in biodistribution of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  in patients receiving HER2 
directed therapy.   
2) Patients who have archived tissue or will be having a clinically indicated biopsy will be asked 
to consent to have  this tissue made available for molecular analysis of their tumor  to 
correlate with imaging results.  
3) Evaluate imaging results with response to treatment.  
Patient Population:   
The study group will be comprised of 55 patients with primary or metastatic HER2 positive EG 
cancer with evidence of measurable or evaluable disease.  
Design:    
PET imaging studies with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  will be carried out in 55 patients. All patients will 
receive 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  radiotracer and then undergo PET scanning to determine if tumor 
localization is observed. Ten patients will undergo injection of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab and undergo 
serial imaging, serum sampling and wh ole body counts for determination of biodistribution, 
dosimetry, pharmacokinetics and identification of optimal imaging time. The patients will be asked to 
consent to provide  molecular analysis  data obtained from archived tissue  from their tumors, which 
will be correlated with89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  imaging results  once funding is available . No molecular 
analysis or tissue procurement will be done under this protocol . In both cohorts (up to 55 patients),  
those receiving HER2 directed therapy (e.g. trastuzumab, afatinib or lapatinib) , will receive up to two 
injections of 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab, prior to commencing treatment and within 6 weeks of  start of 
HER2 directed therapy. The second injection will require a s ingle timepoint scan.   
Treatment Plan:    
For each PET study: patients will receive 5 mCi + 0.5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab given IV over 5 -
10 min. Because of well described, dose dependent pharmacokinetics in the literature, injection of 
cold trastuzumab will be mixed with 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab so that total mass is equal to 50 mg [1]. 
In the first ten patients we wish to obtain normal organ dosimetry, pharmacokinetics and determine 
optimal imaging time, ther efore these patients will undergo imaging at [ADDRESS_1099627] injection, 
whole body counts and blood draws. Subsequent patients will receive the antibody and will only 
undergo imaging at a single time point (based on the first 10 patients) and will not have whole body 
counts or  serial bloods for pharmacokinetics.   The administration of 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab to 
patients undergoing a second study will be identical as for their baseline study. Patient s undergoing 
a second injection  will only have one scan t hat will be performed within 1 day before or 2 days after 
their optimum imaging time point, determined from their baseline imaging study .  
Duration of Study:    
Accrual to this study should be complete in 24 months.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

3.[ADDRESS_1099630], bladder, ovarian, endometrial, 
cervical, lung, stomach, prostate as well as head and neck and pancreatic cancers [2]. In 
preclinical studies, HER2 over -expression has been found to contribute to oncogenic 
transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastatic potential [3, 4]. In human breast cancers, 
HER2 is overexpressed in 20 -30% of cases, and this has been correlated with resistance to 
therapy, shorter disease -free and overall sur vival in patients with this disease [5, 6]. The 
ErbB2 /HER2 oncogene encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that belongs to 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) family and plays an essential role in promoting 
cell growth, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The f amily is comprised of 
ErbB1 (EGFR/HER1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). Each receptor 
has an extracellular domain, a lipophilic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine 
kinase domain. Activation of the kinase occurs with ligan d binding and hetero - or 
homodimerization of these receptors. Ligand -independent activation of HER2 may occur due 
to mutations in HER2 or receptor overexpression [7]. Activation plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_797171] h has been shown to be mediated largely through activation of 
the phosphatidylinositol 3’ -kinase -AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K -AKT-mTOR) 
pathway [8]. Hence HER2 has become a very important target of anticancer drug 
development.    
Trastu zumab, a humanized anti -HER2 monoclonal antibody (Herceptin; Genentech, South 
San Francisco, CA), inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells with HER2 over -expression [9]. 
In a landmark randomized clinical trial, the addition of trastu zumab to chemotherapy 
improved response rates and prolonged survival for patients with HER2 -overexpressing 
metastatic breast cancer [10]. Four separate, large, multicenter randomized adjuvant trials 
have shown a 50% reduction in the risk of recurrence for women with HER2+ early stage 
breast cancer treated with trastu zumab plus chemot herapy versus chemotherapy alone [11, 
12]. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_797172], trastu zumab has activity in only a minority of breast 
cancer patients with HER2 over -expression, with response rates for trastuzumab 
monotherapy in the range of 12 - 26% [13-15]. Moreover, resistance to trastu zumab 
eventually develops in the majority of cases.  
3.1 The Problem Being Addressed : 
3.1.1  Esophagogastric adenocarcinoma  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099631] common cause of cancer -related death  [16, 17]. Most patients  with 
esophagogastric cancer present with stage IV disease, which is incurable. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], 
systemic chemotherapy can lead to a decrease in cancer -related symptoms and prolongs 
survival  [11, 18-20]. However, even  with treatment, most patients with advanced gastric 
cancer have a median survival of less than 1 year. More specific molecularly targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_797173].  
3.1.2 Human Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907] (HER2) in esophagogastric 
adenocarcinoma   
HER2 is a validated treatment target in esophagogastric cancer, based on results of the 
trastu zumab  in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treat ment of 
HER2 -positive advanced gastric or gastro -esophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase III, 
open -label, randomized controlled trial  demonstrating improved response and survival when 
trastu zumab is added to chemotherapy. Approximately 30% of stomach ca rd 
ia/gastroesophageal junction (GE junction) tumors harbor HER2  gene amplification 
(assessed by [CONTACT_781652] [FISH] and/or HER2 oncoprotein 
overexpression (assessed by [CONTACT_9064] [IHC]) [21-23]. The rise in the incidence 
of gastroesophageal junction tumors in western countries  [24, 25] underscores the 
significance of this new target in es ophagogastric cancer, and opens a new drug 
development strategy for this disease.  
There is limited data on the heterogeneity of expression of HER2 in gastric cancer between 
primary and metastatic sites [26]. In one report a discrepancy betwe en primary and 
metastatic lesions was seen in 2 of 60 cases [27], with disc repancy seen between different 
tumor blocks. There is some data that suggest heterogeneity between primary and 
metastatic lesion in breast cancer  [28]. There have been report of discrepancy between FISH 
and protein expression, this may allow imaging to more effectively select patients who are 
better candidates for trastuzumab therapy.  
3.1.3 ToGA study: trastu zumab in HER2 -positive esophagogastric adenocarcinoma   
With the results of the phase III ToGA study, the benefit of trastu zumab in combination with 
cisplatin and fluoropyrimidine (CF) chemotherapy in HER2 -positive metastatic 
esophagogastric adenocarcinoma has been established [29]. This study comprised 584 
patients with HER2 -positive gastric or GE junction tumors. Patients were randomly assigned 
to receive cisplatin and capecitabine (fluorouracil infusion was given to patients who were 
unable to take oral medication) alone or with trastu zumab. Patients assigned to receive 
trastu zumab with chemotherapy had a significant improvement in all measures of efficacy 
including overall survival , progression -free survival, and overall response rate (CR+PR). 
Notably, patients with strongly HER2 -positive tumors (IHC 2+/FISH+ or IHC3+) derived the 
greatest overall survival benefit with the addition of trastu zumab to chemotherapy [29]. The 
selection of high HER2 expressing patients may be a setting in which quantitative imaging 
with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab may provide prognostic info rmation for patient selection to HER2 
directed therapy.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099632] biological strategy to show a survival benefit in advanced 
esophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Trastu zumab is now approved by [CONTACT_797192] (EMA) for treatment of patients with HER2 -positive advanced gastric cancer in 
combination with systemic chemotherapy.  
3.1.4  Trastu zumab: mechanism of action and the emergence of resistance   
Trastu zumab is approved by [CONTACT_797193]2 -
positive advanced gastric cancer in combination with systemic chemotherapy.  Resistance to 
trastu zumab is now emerging in HER2 -positive esophagogastric cancer.  There is no 
standard o f care treatment at this time that has been shown to reliably induce a second 
response in these patients.   
Whereas anti -HER2 therapy with trastu zumab has shown efficacy in some HER2 -positive 
esophagogastric cancer, limitations to this approach can include  coincident activation of 
downstream signaling pathways. In HER2 -positive breast cancer, both de novo  and acquired 
resistance to trastu zumab are now recognized [30]. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of 
trastu zumab resistance will aid in the development of new targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] a number 
of putative models of resistan ce have been described in HER2 -positive breast cancer [14]. In 
breast cancer , one of the best -characterized mechanisms of trastu zumab resistance involves 
increased signaling from other EGFR members of EGFR family of receptors. Other 
mechanism  of resistance is the accumulation of a truncated form of HER2 (p95 -HER2) 
which lacks the extracellular domain needed for trastu zumab b inding. This truncated receptor 
maintains kinase activity independent of ligand binding and is able to activate downstream 
signaling pathways  [31]. By [CONTACT_797194] 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab we may be able to detect 
patients who lack the extracellular domain of HER2 , since they are expected to have a 
negative scan .  
Activation of PI3K -AKT-mTOR pathway by [CONTACT_797195], loss of the PTEN tumor 
suppressor and mutational activation of PI3K, has been demonstrated to confer resistance to 
trastu zumab in animal models and a small series of clinical tumor samples in b reast cancer  
[32]. Increased insulin -like growth factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) signaling is also associated with 
PI3K-AKT activation and trastu zumab resistance  [33, 34]. In gastric cancer tumors, IGF -1R is 
most commonly overexpressed in HER2 -positive tumors and correlates with poor prognosis 
and increased propensity to metastasize [12, 35, 36].  Through a better u nderstanding of 
these models of resistance, new targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_797174]2 -positive esophagogastric cancer patients.  
3.1.5  EGFR/HER2 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)  
A series of TKI’s of HER [ADDRESS_1099633] cancer 
patients [37, 38]. In a number of studies of single agent lapatinib in esophagogastric 
adenocarcinomas, modest activity has been documented [39]. 
Lapatinib is currently being tested in two phase III trials in gastric cancer. TYTAN is an open -
label, randomized phase III study comparing pacli taxel with paclitaxel plus lapatinib in 
patients with HER2 FISH -amplified gastric cancer as a second -line therapy.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099634] that second -generation irreversible inhibitors covalently bind HER2 and 
EGFR (unlike lapatinib, which compete with ATP in a reversible manner) in a highly selective 
fashion may be able to overcome trastu zumab resistance.  
Afatinib ( BIBW 2992) is a highly selective and potent low molecular weight, irreversible 
inhibitor of the erbB -family tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR, HER2 and HER4. MSK 
preclinical data shows potent antitumor activity of single agent afatinib in HER2 -positive 
esophagogastric c ancer xenografts (Janjigian 2011 unpublished data and is the basis for an 
ongoing MSKCC protocol 11 -166.).  
3.2 Positron Emission Tomography (PET)  
PET has advantages over conventional imaging methods because it quantitatively assesses 
biologic processes in  vivo and can assess molecular based pathways  using specific 
radiotracers. Processes that can be analyzed with currently available reagents include 
glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, proliferation, blood flow, and receptor status (i.e., 
androgen receptor) . Most clinical  studies have focused on the accumulation of FDG . 
 
A large amount of work has been performed using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies with 
single photon emitters such as I -131, I -123, Tc -99m and In -111. In contrast to single photon 
emitters,  positron emitters have advantages over conventional imaging methods because it 
quantitatively assesses biologic processes in vivo, furthermore PET scanner have higher 
sensitivity and resolution that conventional scanner for single photon emitters  and are 
quantitative .   
Various imaging studies have been performed with positron labeled antibodies. Our group 
has been a pi[INVESTIGATOR_797175] I-[ADDRESS_1099635] shown the 
excellent imaging characteristics of I -124 cG250 in patients with clear cell renal cancer [40]. 
In that study there was a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 100%.  This has led to a Phase 
[ADDRESS_1099636] reported the targeting, imaging and pharmac okinetic characteristics of 
I-124 A33 monoclonal antibody in colorectal cancer patients [41].  In the latter [ADDRESS_1099637] used Ga -68 DOTA F(ab)’2 trastu zumab for monitoring HER2 inhibition with 
HSP90 inhibitors, as a basis for non -invasive imaging of pharmacod ynamics of drug action 
[42, 43]. Our initials studies using Cu -64 DOTA trastu zumab demonstrated the safety and 
tolerability of this reagent in 11 patients.  Furthermore, those studies showed that tumor 
localization could be observed in selected patients receiving large doses of trastu zumab  
although sensitivity was limited  (personal observation, data not published ). The 
pharmacokinetics of the intact Cu -64 DOTA -trastu zumab showed a  biologic  half-life of 
approximately 3 days and a mean of ~81% was present in the plasma [ADDRESS_1099638] 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab antibody. The PET images wi ll allow us to see the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

 distribution of trastu zumab into different tissues and organs as well as tumor sites. The 
longer T1/[ADDRESS_1099639] 
cancer and head and neck has been r eported  [1, 44]. Furthermore , in an our own ongoing 
trial with 89-Zr-DFO -J591 excel lent targeting has been observed.    
 
 
3.2.1  89Zirconium  
89Zr is an attractive metallo -radionuclide for use in immuno -PET due to favorable decay 
characteristics. It has a 78.4h half life and a 22.7% positron yield.  
Standardized methods for the routine production and isolation of high -purity and high -
specific -activity 89Zr using a small cyclotron are reported. Optimized cyclotron conditions 
reveal high average yields of 1.52 ± 0.11 mCi/muA*h at a proton beam energy of  15 MeV 
and current of 15 muA using a solid, commercially available 89Y-foil target (0.1 mm, 100% 
natural abundance). The effective specific activity of 89Zr was found to be in the range of 
5.2813.43 mCi/microg (470 1195 Ci/mmol) of zirconium.  
Radiolabel ing studies using the trihydroxamate ligand desferrioxamine B (DFO) gave 100% 
radiochemical yields in <15 min at room temperature, and in vitro  stability measurements 
confirmed that (89Zr) Zr-DFO is stable with respect to ligand dissociation in human serum  for 
>7 days. Small -animal show that  89Zr chloride and 89Zr -oxalate reached 15 - 20% of injected 
dose in bone  after 6 days whereas 89Zr-phosphate was only 5% of ID in bone but high 
amounts in the liver and the spleen  [45].  
These results have important imp lications for the analysis of immuno -PET imaging of 89Zr-
DFO labeled monoclonal antibodies. The detailed methods described can be easily 
translated to other radiochemistry facilities and will facilitate the use of 89Zr in both basic 
science and clinical investigations [46-48].  
3.2.[ADDRESS_1099640] based our antibody mass dose selection on previous dose seeking clinical studies  
using  radiolabeled trastuzumab  [1]. Furthermore we have drawn on the experience with 
various other antibodies to select our initial mass of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab . The 
pharmacokinetics of a variety of radiolabeled antibodies has been determined in humans. 
Some antibodies have cross reactivit y with normal antigens in vivo and thus require a certain 
mass amount in order to optimize pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. As an example 
clinical trials with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab have shown that mass of about 50 mg is necessary Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099641] shown 
that doses much smaller than 50 mg resulted in poor biodistribution [49].  Studies in patients 
with lymphoma targeting CD2 0 with  In-111 I britumomab (2B8) showed that in 6 of 10 
patients more lesions were identified with 1mg/kg co -infusion than with 2 mg total of antibody 
[50].   A clinical trial using In -111 hPAM4  showed good targeting and similar 
pharmacokinetics of doses ranging from < 10 mg compared to 100 mg [51] with T1/[ADDRESS_1099642] ut ilized PET imaging of I -124 anti -huA33 antibody to target 
A33 antigen, a transmembrane glycoprotein with homology to tight junction -associated 
proteins that is present in normal colon and small bowel epi[INVESTIGATOR_797176] 95% of 
human colon adenoca rcinoma and approximately 50% of gastric and  pancreatic cancers, 
while absent in most other human tissues and tumors [52]. Our studies utilizing [ADDRESS_1099643] demonstrated Vd close to that of plasma 
3,257 +  631 mL,  T1/2 of ~ 65 h and Co of ~31.9%ID/L [41]. In our experience the use of 10 
mg of I -124 chimeric antibody cG250 resulted in  excellent imaging of renal cell tumors [40]. 
The pharmacokinetic analysis in a clinical trial that used 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg of I -131 
cG250 showed that at the 2 mg dose levels there was faster clearance but at all other levels 
there was no dose response with a median T1/2 of 68.5 h. When doses of 25 and 50 mg of 
cG250 were  administered there was less tumor uptake than at the 10 mg dose [53]. 
Humanized antibody hPAM4 specifically binds a mucin glycoprotein expressed in pancreatic 
adenocarcinomas.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_1099644] used 
various positron emitters for labeling antibodies. It is we ll known that for antibodies that 
internalize there is significant improved tumor retention of radio metals compared to Iodinated 
antibodies [54]. 89Zr has an ideal half -life (78h)  that is well matched to the half life of intact 
IgG in the intravascular compartment , that in the case of trastuzumab varies from [ADDRESS_1099645] cancer  showed excellent 
visualization and uptake in HER2 -positive tumors. [1]  
89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab PET has a potential advantage over single site biopsies as it can non -
invasively assess target engagement and inhibition  reflecting the functional effects of HER2 -
targeted agents in the primary tumor and all sites of metastases simultaneously  [55, 56]. In 
HER2 -positive EG cancer, heterogeneity of HER2 expression within primary tumors and 
metastasis is a particular challenge and may contribute to trastuzumab resistance . Moreover, 
the biodistribution of tr astuzumab varies in each patient and is heavily impacted by [CONTACT_797196], which may contribute to variations in patient responses  [57]. 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab PET can thus help  elucidate the molecular basis of resistance to trastuzumab in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

agents tailored to individual patient’s tumor burden and biology. Decrease in FDG -PET 
uptake of greater  than 30% from baseline is a validated predictor of tumor response and 
survival with chemotherapy in EG cancer patients  [58-60]. However, a propo rtion of EG 
cancers are not FDG-PET avid  [61], thus  89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab   may provide a method to 
asses response . 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab PET showed excellent tumor visualization in patients 
with HER2 -positive breast cancer  [1, 62]. MSKCC data demonstrates that 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab PET can image the tumor response and PD changes in HER2 -positive EG 
xenografts treated with afatinib (Fig 1), while  the changes are not visualized with FDG-PET.

4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This is a single institution, open -label, non -randomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_797178] 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab PET imaging in p atients with HER2 -positive esophagogastric cancer . Patients 
will receive up to 5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab (initial [ADDRESS_1099648] if technically feasible).  In order to optimize tumor 
targeting the activity  of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  will be brought up to a final 50mg dose by 
[CONTACT_797197]-conjugated  trastu zumab (example 5 mCi/3mg DFO -trastu zumab  + 47 mg of 
trastu zumab).  Data in the literature, in breast  cancer patient s, has shown that the optimal 
mass of trastu zumab is ~[ADDRESS_1099649] [1]. During the 
biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and optimization phase , [ADDRESS_1099650] one cycle of 
therapy , or at a time point that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_529926] -Pi’s consider appropriate . At least [ADDRESS_1099651] elapsed between baseline and secon d injection to allow for decay  and no more than 6 
weeks . The second study will also be done using up to 5 mCi/ combined  [ADDRESS_1099652] injection as 
on the baseline study or within ~ 1d prior or [ADDRESS_1099653] optimal baseline imaging . In patients 
in cohort 1 (before selection of optimal imaging time) the study will be performed with ~[ADDRESS_1099654] imaging on their baseline study.  Images from both studies will be compared to 
determine similarities in biodistribution (concentration of activity in  normal  organs an d tumor) .  
Baseline testing will be performed prior to injections with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab. This 
includes history, hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, negative serum pregnancy test for female 
of child bearing potential, vital signs, ECG and baseline serum sample will be collected  for 
possible analysis of complex formation if altered pharmacokinetics are observed  and banked 
for testing of immune response to the DFO -trastu zumab . Patients will be assessed for 
toxicity.  
Because 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  has only been evaluated in a small number of patients, and 
since no studies have been performed in the [LOCATION_003] , toxicity assessment will be performed 
using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099655] 10 patients,   two intravenous catheters  will be 
inserted whenever feasible to allow for separate site for injection and blood draw for 
pharmacokinetics. For others who will receive scanning only,  one IV  will b e inserted . The 
89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab tracer dose will be combined with non -radiolabeled trastu zumab for a 
total of 50 mg trastu zumab will be injected IV over 5 -10 min using an in -line (0.22 micron) 
filter, followed by a flush of ~10 ml of normal saline. Th e infusion will be carried out under the 
supervision of the Principal Investigator (PI) or an auth orized user assigned by [CONTACT_978].  The 
syringe will be measured for 89Zr radioactivity prior to and at the end of infusion, and the net 
amounts of radioactivity will be recorded, along with the time of measurement, and the net 
amount of radioactivity administered calculated.   
Patients undergoing serial imaging will have whole body count measurements using a NaI 
probe, placed at ~3.3 yards  from the patient , to determine whole body retention : after 
antibody infusion, prior to voiding and post void, as well as at each time of return for imaging.  
Imaging for the initial group undergoing serial scans will start within 1 -4 hr of end of the 89Zr-
DFO -trastu zumab infusion, ~24h, ~48 -96h and ~[ADDRESS_1099656] one scan that will be 
performed within 1 day before or 2 days after their optimum imaging time point, determined 
from their baseline imaging study.  
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling will be performed utilizing a sep arate IV site (if feasible). 
Blood samples for 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab levels will be drawn prior to the 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  injection and at  approximately 5 ± 2, 15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19, an d 120 to 240 
minutes and a sample at the time of each subsequent day of imaging (~24h, ~48 -96h and 
~120 -192h) post injection  these are id eal times and after the first day a window of ± 8h will 
be allowed . In all patients on the day of first infusion and prior to 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab 
injection baseline blood will banked for determination of complexes formation with 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab .

89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab     
Radiolabeling of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab : The 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab will be labeled in 
accordance with the MSKCC investigator sponsored IND. The study will be performed under 
an FDA approved IND for 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab , no studies will be performed until the IND 
is approved. The final product will contain up to [ADDRESS_1099662] fashion currenly made for clinical administration .  
Images will be  corrected for attenuation and scatter and adjusted for system sensitivity and 
providing parametric images in terms of standardized uptake values (SUV) (= μCi found/gm 
tissue / (μCi injected/gm body mass).  
Radiochemical Purity  
The amount of free 89Zr in radiolabeled DFO -trastu zumab preparations is evaluated using 
instant thin layer chroma tography. Only samples which have a radiochemical purity of >95% 
will be used for clinical studies. Release criteria in accordance with IND, must be met prior to 
use.   
Immunoreactivity  
The immunoreactivity of the radiolabeled 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  preparation is assessed 
using Lindmo’s method  [63]. The method has been validated in at least 3 immunoreactivity 
assays, to meet the criteria specified in the IND.  All radiolabeled preparations will be tested 
for immunoreactivity, though the 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  will be administered prior to the se 
resul ts being available.

  Hematology: CBC, differential count, platelet count.  
 Pregnancy test to be  performed on female patients of childbearing potential within 1 week  
before administration of radioactive material.  
 Clinically available imaging studies will be reviewed, including CT , FDG  and or MRI and 
other availabl e studies, such as  bone scans.  These studies must be from within 4 weeks 
of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  injection.  
9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
9.[ADDRESS_1099670] 2 intravenous catheters ( Hep-Lock) placed by [CONTACT_797202], or alternatively a central line may be used for injection or sampling . The 
intravenous  placed catheter for injection and/or blood draw during study will be removed at 
the conclusion of the imaging  session . If two lines are not feasible, one line will be used for 
both injection and PK sampling with intervening 10 cc saline flush  and change of catheter 
hub. Patients in Cohort 2 (no pharmacokinetics ), will not require a second catheter.  
To determine pharmacokinetic  and for possibly metabolite analysis of the drug, patients 
undergoing pharmacokinetics  will have serial blood samples drawn:  
 Blood  sample, 4-6 mL of blood will be drawn in a speckled top serum separator 
tube.  
 Blood will be centrifuged  in [CONTACT_797217] ’s lab, and the serum  pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] d and 
counted.  Samples may be tested for breakdown products by [CONTACT_589809].    
 Blood draws will be done p rior to injection of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab     (baseline) , 
approximately baseline, 5 ± 2,  15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19, and 120 to 240 minutes 
after injection of the tracer . One sample at the ti me of each subsequent day of 
imaging (24 , ~48 -96h and ~[ADDRESS_1099671] injection , in order to build in flexibility 
after the  initial injection  day we will allow  ± 8h of stated times ). 
 Pharmacokinetic parameters will be obtained including Concentration at time 0, 
Volume of distribution of central compartment (Vc) , clearance,T1/2 and AUC.  
9.2 Imaging  
PET scanning:  In order to provide reproducible clinical data, we will acquire all 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  PET scans on the GE PET -CT scanner DSTE at MSKCC or the same  type or a 
newer generation scanner . Once a study is begun in one scanner,  it will be continued on the 
same scanner unless malfunction/e mergency issues prevent this .  Intravenous injection of 
89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  (maximum of 5 mCi ± 10%) will be given over 5 -10 minutes . Initially 
we will start with ~ 5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zuma b; the activity may be adjusted downward Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099672] scan extending from mid skull to proximal  
thighs  will be performed to determine the biodistribution . For patient undergoing serial 
scanning one scan will be performe d utilizing  low mA  (80 mA ) and on subsequent days,  we 
will use [ADDRESS_1099673] -injection 
to allow for selection of optimal imaging time and d osimetry determination.   
 Within one to four hours following injection of tracer on Day 0 
 ~24 ± 8hours post -injection (Day 1) 
 ~48[ADDRESS_1099674] -injection (once during Days 24) ±8h 
 ~120192hours post injection (once during Days 58)±8h 
Imaging will be in 3D, typi[INVESTIGATOR_797181] (approximately 6 -7 bed positions) to 
allow for estimates of whole organ  uptake and excretion patterns.  These whole body studies 
will vary in duration according to the height of the patient but will typi[INVESTIGATOR_175640] 21 -60 minutes in 
duration.  
 
Active lesions  will be identified ( Molecular Ima ging investigator ) based  on review of the 
patients conventional images and treatment history ( i.e. external radiation) . A PET positive 
lesion will be considered present if there is gr eater localization than that expected based on 
blood pool distribution of the tracer.  Given that at present we do not know the heterogeneity 
of the antigen between lesions  or between primary and metastatic disease  a patient will be 
considered positive if any of the active lesions are identified with the 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab . 
We will, nonetheless tabulate the number of lesions and their status based on 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab . When pathologic material that has been evaluated for the presence of HER2  is 
available for any specific lesion, we will correlate the presence of HER2  with imaging results.  
Images will be analyzed with ROI and SUV mean and max measurements will be obtained . 
The serial quantitative data obtained over the various organs of interest  (heart, liver, spleen, 
kidney, lung  and any other organ that exhibits uptake  will be collected .  These data can then 
be utilized to determine organ time activity curves and the dosimetry  can be calculated . 
Uptake and clearance values will be summarized us ing descriptive statistics (mean, median , 
standard deviation ). Once the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics have been characterized, 
subsequent patients will not require serial imaging and pharmacokinetics, but rather will have 
a single scan at an optimal  time point determined  from the initial cohort . We will determine 
the time at which the greatest number of lesions are seen . This is likely to be between 3-[ADDRESS_1099675] Cohort 1 p atients’ data, using the most frequent 
day at which the most lesions are seen  and/or at times at which best contrast is observed , 
determined visually .  Thus, for  the remainder of the patients , PET scan will be performed 
once .   
Images will be stored as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) on the 
PACS  and HERMES . No decision on the patients ’ health care management will be made 
based on  imaging with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  scan .

 Patients undergoing pharmacokinetics and serial imaging will undergo whole body activity  
measurement using a NaI probe placed at ~ 3.[ADDRESS_1099676] 
procedure . These measurements will be performed the day of injection of 89Zr DFO -
trastu zumab before voiding  (if patient has to void before the initial measurement, urine will be 
collected and counted together with the patient) and after first void, and at each time the 
patient returns for imaging (typi[INVESTIGATOR_797182] 6 minutes).  
9.4 Assessment for Toxicity  
Safety  Outcome  Measures (CTCAE v4)  
Infusion Reaction  
Infusion reactions with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  at these low milligram administration  are 
expected to be infrequent.  In the event of fever, rigors,  shortness of breath, or other evidence 
of infusion reaction, patients may receive diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg IV and Tylenol 650 mg  
PO as felt to be clinically appropri ate by [CONTACT_1963].   
Patients  will be monitored  during  and after 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab  infusion  for 60 minutes  
after the infusion . Patients  who experience  infusion -related  symptoms  should  be 
managed  as directed  in Table  1. 
The safety  and tolerability  of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  w i l l  be assessed  using  the 
following primary  safety  outcome  measure:  
 Incidence,  nature,  and severity  of adverse  events up to day 14 by [CONTACT_797203].  
 Change  in vital signs  during administration

 10.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
Laboratory Safety Assessments  
Blood testing:  
Hematology and blood chemistry assessments  (CBC,  serum BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase, albumin  and blood glucose levels ) will be done at the time points

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
Risks  
89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab     
Overall our experience with other radiolabeled antibodies and radiolabeled trastuzumab are that 
allergic reactions are uncommon.  Therefore no pretreatment will be provided before antibody 
injection. Potential risks associated with 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab   are similar to those of other 
humanized antibody and include allergic reactions, characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, and sometimes 
rashes or hives.  Less likely  shortness of breath or gastrointestinal upset can occur.  Rare allergic 
reactions can present as shock  or de ath or swelling of the throat. Heart failure, although observed 
with therapeutic doses of trastuzumab are not expected at these lower ~ 50mg x 2 doses. Allergic  
reactions are us ually addressed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_331104], administerin g 
diphenhydramine  , acetaminophen  and/or steroids , and restarting the drug at a slower rate if the 
reaction is not severe.  We will also follow MSKCC  guidelines for “adult hypersensitivity orders for 
chemotherapy/biologic therapy ”, which intstitutes therapy according to the severity of the reaction.  
There is a very small risk of infection. This could cause itching or redness at the area on the 
patient’s arm where the IV was placed.  
89Zr DFO -trastu zumab PET/CT Scans  
As part of th is scan there is radiation delivered from the 89Zr and from the low dose CT scan that are 
performed as part of the CT for attenuation correction and co -registration. Although any exposure to 
ionizing radiation has the potential to cause some harm to tissue , the radiation exposures in this 
study are comparable to the low -level exposures associated with common diagnostic procedures 
such as CT scanning. There remains a low theoretical risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a cancer at some point 
later in life because  of the radia tion exposure received in this study. This risk is particularly low for 
adults given the fact that the radiation from the sc ans will be over several weeks.  Participants should 
avoid pregancy  while on this study. Acceptable birth control methods include abs tinence, double 
barrier method, surgically sterilized patient or partner. This risk is much smaller that the clinical risks 
posed by [CONTACT_102]’s current cancer.

 Normal -organ radiation absorbed doses and the effective dose for 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  in human 
were estimated based on measu red time -activity data in mice.  The time -activity data (percent of the 
injected dose per gram (%ID/gm) versus time (t) post -administration) for each organ were fit to an 
exponential functions and the  resulting function were analytically integrated (incorporating the 
radioactive decay of 89Zr) to yield the residence time (cumulated activity) of 89Zr in each organ.  The 
mouse organ 89Zr residence times were converted to 89Zr residence times in human orga ns (for the 
70-kg Standard Man anatomic model) by [CONTACT_797204].  The resulting human residence times were then entered into the 
OLINDA/EXM radionuclide dosimetry program, which implements th e MIRD (Medical Internal 
Radionuclide Dosimetry) algorithm, to yield the n ormal -organ radiation absorbed doses (in cGy) and 
effective dose (in rem) for 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab in man.  Assuming a 5 -mCi administered activity of 
89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  and a low -dose (80 mA) and three very -low-dose (10 -mA) CT scans are to be 
performed, with approximate CT  effective doses of 0.90 rem and 0.11 rem the radiation dosimetry is 
tabulated below  to include the second injection of  89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab , that some  patients may 
receive (Table 2).

In accordance with local and Federal regulations (USNRC), patients administered 89Zr can be 
released from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797183] a member of the public is unlikely to 
receive greater than 1 mSv. Conservative regulatory guidance s uggests that in the case of 89Zr, a 
patient can be released from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797184]: they receive < 
5 mCi or the dose rate at 1 meter from the patient is < 4 mrem/h.   In a subset of 10 patients from a 
previous prot ocol who received a mean activity of 5 mCi 89Zr-J591, the measured dose rate at 1 
meter averaged 1.9 mrem/h and the maximum dose rate was 2.3 mrem/h. As these values are 
demonstrated to be well below 4 mrem/h, patients administered 5 mCi 89Zr for this curr ent diagnostic 
protocol can be released from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797185].  
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
We will determine the toxicity, optimum imaging time and the feasibility of using 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  as an imaging agent in esophagogastric tumors that express HER2.  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_797186], once 
patients undergo HER2 directed therapy and a second 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab     imaging study.    
Decay corrected images will be assessed, SUVmax and mean  values for regional dose distribution 
will be calculated, and converted using excel into values that can be entered into the OLINDA 
software package that will ultimately calculate t he absorbed doses.   
Positive lesions on 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  will be defined visually as a focus of  accumulation of  
radio activity that is deemed to not be physiologic and is higher than adjacent or contralateral 
background.   Antibody scan will be read b linded from clinical history and conventional imaging 
modalities.  Two different  experienced,  blinded readers will visually  analyz e the 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  scans, and SUVmax/mean will be determined in lesions identified and in normal organs 
and blood pool . To study the accumulation and biodistribution of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab     in patients 
with esophagogastric  cancer, the accumulation of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  will be assessed for each 
site and compared with the  clinically established lesion in the  baselin e radionuclide bone scan,  FDG 
PET/CT,  CT, and /or MRI imaging . The definition of a positive lesion will be a lesion identified by [CONTACT_797205]/MRI, and/or FDG scan consistent with metastatic Spleen

 disease, as is currently done  clinically.  Lesions on 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  or conventional imaging 
will be read in a scale of 1 to 5, 1= negative, 2 = probably negative, 3= not sure, 4= probably positive 
and 5= definitively positive. Once this is done, a consensus master list of lesio ns will be created that 
compares all imaging conventional imaging modalities (CT/MRI, FDG PET, bone scan) , only those 
lesions that are conspi[INVESTIGATOR_797187] (i .e., “4 or 5”) by [CONTACT_797207] a positive site 
of disease . Discrepant findings b etween findings on conventional imaging and 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  modalities will be considered false positive or false negative.  Although it would be ideal 
to biopsy any site that is considered abnormal this is not logistically feasible or ethically acceptable. 
Successful imaging will be considered a positive imaging in  > 70% of patients .  One or 2 non -
blinded readers (access to clinical, laboratory and imaging data) will identify “positive lesions” .  
As a first level, we will compare si te by [CONTACT_3725]. Since the individual modalities are based on different 
mechanisms of uptake, they may not have exact correspondence in space, since bone scan is a 2D 
modality and  89Zr looks at tumor antigen expression and is a 3D modality. For this purpose, w e have 
made a list of standardized anatomic sites, to make sure that a positive lesion would have a positive 
89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab  uptake.  As a second level, we will compare lesion by [CONTACT_240765].   
12.[ADDRESS_1099692] and/or MRI imaging done clinically will be used as a correlative diagnostic imaging tool 
to compare to results of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab PET scanning. Furthermore soft tissue lesions 
greater than [ADDRESS_1099693] inform the investigator immediately. In 
addition, the investigator has the right to terminate  participation of any patient at any time if it is 
deemed in the patient’s best interest. The reason and circumstances for premature discontinuation 
will be documented in the patient’s medical records. Possible examples for reasons of premature 
study withd rawal include withdrawal of consent, SAE or intolerable AE, or any other medical illness 
at investigator’s discretion.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
14.1 Primary Objective  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the feasibility, 
safety and tolerability of administration of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab     antibody . 
Definition of Feasibility : Antibody imaging is considered feasible if 70% of the patients are 
antibody -imaging positive as defined below.  
Defintion of Ant ibody-Positive:  A patient with HER2 positive tumor will be considered 
antibody -imaging -positive if 50% or more of the active lesions (FDG positive, bone scan 
positive or CT positive >2cm)  are detectable in any of the scanning time points ([ADDRESS_1099694] 10 patients and 1 scan in all others) . Active lesion means  any lesion that was 
identified by [CONTACT_797208]: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-[ADDRESS_1099695] selected a threshold of  50% for this first imaging study for 3 rea sons: 1) we 
do not know what the heterogeneity of antigen expression is within a number of lesions in the 
same patient; 2) we will consider positive any lesion based on conventional clinical imaging 
criteria, in which case some lesions considered positive may be false positive and more 
importantly  3) our main long term emphasis is to evaluate whether this imaging will identify 
HER2 positive patients and whether identification of these patients for treatment with HER2 
directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_797188].   Thus,  we do not want to discard this agent if we can 
use it as a thera nostic (defined as an agent  that is integrated into the drug development 
process to guide patient selection and drug development) , for the development  of therapeutic 
regimens aimed at HER2 . Nonetheless, we intend to evaluate treatment response of all 
available lesions in this way we will maximize our ability to determine the relationship 
between uptake of antibody and response.  
The optimal time for imaging will be estimated based on res ults from the first [ADDRESS_1099696] may vary between the different imaging days  a consensus 
visual assessment of a group of experienced Molecular Imaging and Therapy  investigator 
who will grade the studies separately (JAC, SML and NPT , 2 of the readers will be blinded  to 
clinical information),  will  be used to make the final decision . 
Evaluation of Feasibility in the First Cohort: Antibody imaging will be considered feasible if [ADDRESS_1099697] cohort are antibody -imaging -positive. We will also  
require that none of these patients experience severe  toxicity attributable to the initial 
antibody. The following table provides the one -sided 90% confidence limit for the true 
feasibility rate based on the number of feasible patients:  
Number of Feasible  Patients   7 8 9 10 
One-sided 90% CL    45% 55% 66% 79% 
If less than 70% of patients are considered positive for imaging in either  the first  cohort  or 
combination of first and second cohort the study will be  closed .   
Tolerability: If the study proceeds to  cohort B, one -sided exact confidence limits will be used 
to estimate the toxicity and feasibility rates at the end of the study using all the  55 patients. 
The following tables give some of the likely outcomes to be observed:  
Number of Patients with Toxici ty  0 1 2

 Dosimetry  and PK : Another objective is to determine the organ/tissue uptake a nd dosimetry  
following IV injection of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab   in patients with HER2 positive tumors. The 
group for this analysis will comprise  10 HER2+ patients in the cohort 1  89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  study the 10 patients that will be recruited in the treatment assessment arm. 
Standardized uptake value (SUV  based on weight and lean body mass ) in various organs will 
be measured and summarized over patients to describe the organ and tissue uptake of the 
tracer. The SUVmean, max and peak will be summarized  with descriptive statistics.  This 
data will be converted to residence time and will be used in OLINDA dosimetry program to 
obtrain dosimetry measurements. The dosimetry estimates will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using a non -compartmental analysis  (SAAM or 
GraphPad  V5); standard parameters such as AUC, clearance, volume of distribution  of 
central compartment , and Co will be reported. Descriptive statistics will be tabulated.  These 
patients will u ndergo a single whole -body scan at the optimal time point. The ability of 89Zr-
DFO -trastu zumab to detect tumors will be estimated from this cohort  using the proportion  of 
antibody -imaging -positive patients  (within +/ -23% if the true detection rate is 7 0%).   
Toxicity:  This study does not intend to find the maximal tolerated dose  of 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab . This is a diagnostic agent that is expected to have low incidence of adverse 
events.  Patients will be monitored closely looking for evid ence of adverse events.  Because  
most  patients are expected to  start new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_6523] 2 weeks of receiving  89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab only short term toxicity will be evaluated. The safety and tolerability of 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab  will be assessed using the following primar y safety outcome measures: 
Incidence and nature and severity of adverse events; and change in vital signs and clinical 
laboratory results. Incidence and severity of adverse events will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics.  
If severe adverse effect (grade 3 or 4 CTCAE) attributable to 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab is 
observed in any cohort we will review with  MSKCC -DSMC .  A secondary objective is to 
correlate 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab  imaging to response to treatment in those patients re cruited 
for repeat imaging following therapy.  Outcome measures to be correlated include those that 
are outlined in any parent protocol under which the patient is receiving treatment (typi[INVESTIGATOR_797189],survival or progression free survival).  
Secondary  Analysis: Preliminary quantitative data will be obtained using SUV measurements 
on baseline study compared to that of patients having repeat 89Zr-DFO -trastuzumab 
study(n=10).  Paired T -test will be performed to estimate the differences. With 10 patients 
having  repeat imaging.  
Imaging result based on mean SUV measurements will be tabulated  and compared to 
clinical response (stable, regression or progression).  Furthemore we will be identify lesion 
outcome (stable, regression or progression) based on the individ ual lesion SUV. The data 
will be expressed in terms of stable, regression and progression versus mean SUV 
measurement  and summarized in terms of descriptive statistics .

16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The data and safety monitoring (DSM) plans at MSKCC were approved by [CONTACT_331125] 2001. The plans address the policies set forth by [CONTACT_797209] , which can be found at http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials . The DSM 
plans at MSKCC were established and are monitored by t he Office of Clinical Research. The 
MSKCC DSM plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/[ZIP_CODE].cfm . 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_797210], safety, 
and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research quality assurance) and departmental procedures for quality 
control, and there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC)  for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB)  for Phase III clinical trials, report to the MSKCC Research Council and 
Institutional Review Board.   
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will b e assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed, 
and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
For this protocol, we will use the following patient safety monitoring plan and mon itoring for 
adverse eve nts, in terms  of the test performed and their tim ing relative to injection (see 
Flowchart 1 and  Flowchart  2).  Patient will be observed closely during infusion and serial vital 
signs will be monitored every half hour for at least 2 h or later if the patient remains in the 
department.  Patients will be queried for adverse events up to ~14 days after infusion.  
Safety reviews will be performed by [CONTACT_331127] -DSMC with yearly review by [CONTACT_1201].

17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP guidelines established by [CONTACT_147622] , and the ethical standards set forth in the Declaration of  
Helsinki 2004 (available at: www.laakariliitto.fi/e/ethics/helsinki.html ). 
A limited waiver of authorization will be utilized to effectively screen and track patients in screening, 
however t he recruitment process outlined presents no more than mini mal risk to the privacy of the 
patients who are screened and minimal protected health information ( PHI) will be maintained as part 
of a screening log.  
This protocol does not have therapeutic intent and does not offer  patients therapeutic benefit. This 
will be clearly conveyed to patients when communicating the potential toxicities/side effects of 
participating in thi s trial. Participation in the trial is voluntary and there will be no financial benefit (or 
burden) for the patients. Participants will not be charged for  89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab PET scans, 
whole body probe counts,  radiotracer drugs , and extra blood draws (to measure radiotracer activity).  
When all other possibilities are exhausted, i f an eligible patient lives outside of [LOCATION_001] City, then 
the patient will be eligible for reimbursement for the costs of parking/ public transportation (up to $50 
per day with receipt) and a two -night stay at an MSKCC approved hotel  (up to $1000 total) , when 
those costs are incurred during the days that the patient visits the Main Campus Radiology 
Department for study injection and scans.

 MSKCC’s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a completed and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A Research Authorization form must be completed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_30505] (IRB/PB).   
 
17.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse event  
 An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or  
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_768896] a planned procedure/disease treatment is not considered an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required as soon as the participant signs consent.  SAE reporting is 
required for 30 -days after the participant’s last investigational treatment or intervention. Any  
events that occur after the [ADDRESS_1099702] be reported . 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the IRB office per IRB SOP RR -408 ‘Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events ’, the SAE report must be sent  to the IRB within 5 calendar days of the event. 
The IRB requires a Clinical Research Database (CRDB) SAE report be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office as follows:   
For IND/IDE trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
[EMAIL_440] .  All other reports should be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other trials: Reports that include a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
[EMAIL_440] .  All other reports should be sent to [EMAIL_203] . 
The report should contain the following information:  
Fields populated from CRDB:  
 Subject’s initials  
 Medical record number  
 Disease/histology (if applicable)  
 Protocol number and title  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12) 
Approval date: 30-Nov-2020 
 
  
 
Page 36 of 44 
 Data needing to be entered:  
 The date the adverse event occurred  
 The adverse event  
 The grade of the event  
 Relationship of the adverse event to the treatment (drug, device, or intervention)  
 If the AE was expected  
 The severity of the AE  
 The intervention  
 Detailed text that includes the following  
o A explanation of how the AE was handled  
o A description of the subject’s condition  
o Indication if the subject remains on the study  
 If an amendment will need to b e made to the protocol and/or consent form  
 If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem  
The PI’s signature [CONTACT_30614].  
For IND/IDE protocols:  
The CRDB SAE report should be completed as per above instructions.   If appropriate, the 
report will be forwarded to the FDA by [CONTACT_193094].  
 
The radiation doses (on the order of 10 rem) lie well within the “low -dose” range —well 
below the threshold doses (typi[INVESTIGATOR_325232] 100 rem or greater) for any known 
deterministic effects. A detailed description of the expected dosimetry from the 89Zr-DFO -
trastu zumab is included (Table 2) . The dose of 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab per administration 
(~5mCi) gives the lowest amount that is expected to  be consistent with the research 
goal, namely, biodistribution, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics of the compou nd. 
 
 
 
17.2.[ADDRESS_1099703]  an IND. SAE will also be reported to the FDA through the IND Office 
and the report will include the FDA assigned BB -IDE, BB -IND or IND number and name.  
Patients will be monitored for adverse events following agent administration. Beginning 
immediately after tracer -injection, patients will be observed for 1 hour in the Radiology 
Department, to monitor for acute adverse reactions.  
Toxicities will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute CTC Scale ( Version 
4.0). Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 13-165 A(12)

 An adverse event is defined by [CONTACT_321769] (Good Clinical Practice guidelines) as an 
undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product(s). It is the responsibil ity of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her research team to identify, review and record all necessary adverse 
events.  
17.3   SAE Grading  
17.3.2 Grading Severity  
All adverse events will be graded for intensity on a scale of 0 to 5. Severity grades will b e 
recorded and based on the CTCAE v 4.0. 
17.3.3 Attributing Causality  
The investigator will evaluate the potential relationship between all clinical AEs, abnormal 
laboratory values, and the 89Zr-DFO -trastu zumab    , and categorize the relationship 
according  to the descriptions in Table 3. Abnormal laboratory values of clinical 
significance that were present at baseline and did not change in either severity or 
frequency during the experimental therapy or intervention and/or that can obviously be 
attributed to  the underlying disease will be evaluated by [CONTACT_797212] “unrelated” category .

Disease 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Protocol Version: June 3, 2022
1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human researc h study. This study is to be conduc ted according 
to US and internationa l standards of Good C linical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
1.1.1. Background on Alzheimer’s disease 
While amyl oid plaques are a pathological hallmark of Alzhe imer’s disease (AD), w hether 
β-amyloid i s the causal agent of neurodegeneration in AD remains unclear. Evidence supporting 
the hypot hesis that amyloid is a primary contributor to AD pathogenesi s (the amyloid- first 
hypot
hes
is) include the finding that genetic mut ations  responsible for inheri ted forms of AD 
cause increased amyloid production. Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) to 
measure amyloi d plaque burden in vivo have demonstrated amyloid positivity before obvious 
atrophy or cognitive decline in healthy older controls. W hile t au positive neurofibrillary tangles 
represent the second hallmark of AD, tau mut ations  are seen in patients with variants of 
frontotempor al de m entia, not AD. The propagation of tau pa thology i s thought to follow 
amyloidosis, suggesti ng amyloid in some way induces tau mediated degeneration. However, the 
link between am yloid an d tau not  cl ear as t here are spatial and  temporal di stinctions. F or 
example, bulk of amyloid burden in medial parietal cortex a nd frontal cortex early on, while tau 
bur
den begins in medial temporal cortex.  
 While β-amyloid has been shown to have direct neurotoxic effects in vitro, t hese effects 
are seen at concentrations of β-amyloid much higher than found in huma n brain[1].T herefore, 
amyl
oid may not confer significant direct toxicity. Rather, amyloid may induce secondary injury 
via activation of immune response. At phys iologic concentrations, β- amyloid a ctivates 
microglia [2], triggeri ng a pro-inflammatory c as cade as these resident neuroimmune  cells a ttempt 
to clear β-amyloid from the br ain[3]. This inflammatory response may be more toxic than β-
amyloid itself, as the resulting release of cytokines, activation of complement, and phagocytosis 
cause los s of neurons[4] . This inflammatory response may be the link between amyloid and tau, 
as inflammation  can re sult in hype r-phosphorylation of tau, l eading to the destabilization of tau 
filaments and aggregation of the neurofibrillary tangles that make up the second pathological 
hallmark of AD[5] . I n tur n, extracellular ta u ac tivates mic rogl ia[6], whic h could create a positi ve 
feedback loop of inflammation and tau pathology that propagates, independent of amyloid 
burden. T he inflammation/tau r ela tionship could also occur independently of the presence of 
amyloid. Indeed, autopsy findings of pre-tangle pathology occurring in midlife prior to 
amyloidosis[7] sugge s t that ta uopathy may begi n prior and independent to si gnificant amyloid 
plaque deposition. Since amyloid burden correlates poorly with cogni tion[8], infla mmation  may 
be a more impor tant mediator  of neurodegeneration in AD. 
Me
asuring inflammati on in vivo may also have an important role in det ermining prognosis 
and evaluating progression of disease in AD patients. Up to 30% of cognitively normal elders are 
amyloid positive on PET. Determining predictors of future cognitive decline among amyloid-
positive elders would allow us to distinguish i ncidental amyloid-positivity f rom that due  to 
inci
pi[INVESTIGATOR_640155]’s di sease in an elderly population. Furthermore, identifying the relative 
impact of inflammation on cognition may justify a more strategic approac h for the development 
of anti-i nflammatory therapeutics for AD. 
 
1.1.2. Background on P
ET imaging of inflammation 
Inflammation can be quantified in vivo using PET imaging with radioligands that bind to 
the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO, formerly called the peripheral benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_32538] ). 
Brain inflammation activates microglia and causes them to over -express TSPO [9]. Measurement 
of microglia activation, defined by [CONTACT_640174], is used as a 
surrogate bio- marker of active brain inflammation[ 10].  PET imaging can quantify TSPO density 
in vivo  using radioligands that cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to TSPO sites. 11C-(R)-PK 
[ZIP_CODE], the prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_640156], has been used to measure neuroinflammatory changes 
in several diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease [10] and  11C-(R)-PK [ZIP_CODE] binding has been 
shown to correlate with Mini- Mental State Examination score in patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease[ 11]. However, there have been conflicting reports about whether  11C-(R)-PK [ZIP_CODE] 
binding is increased in Alzheimer’s disease or not[ 10, 12, 13] . Whether  11C-(R)-PK [ZIP_CODE] 
binding is increased in MCI appears even less conclusive. For instance,  [14] found a small 
increase in  11C-(R)-PK [ZIP_CODE] in PIB-positive patients with MCI relative to controls, but other 
studies found no increase in patients with MCI, even those who later progressed to dementia[ 12, 
13]. 
Limitations of 11C-(R)-PK [ADDRESS_856624] led to development of second generation TSPO 
radioligands. One such radioligand is PBR28, which has high in vitro affinity (~ 1 nM) for TSPO . In nonhuman primates, [
11C]PBR28 has high brain uptake and fast washout[ 15], which 
allows reliable PET quantification. In addition, more than 80% of brain uptake is displaceable by [CONTACT_640175][ 15]. This means that over 80% of uptake is 
specifically bound to TSPO. [
11C]PBR28 has high enough signal- to-noise ratio to localize 
inflammation to relatively small areas in humans with lacunar stroke [16]. Animal toxico logy 
studies and early clinical PET studies have shown safety and tolerability of [11C]PBR28. In 
addition, the radiation exposure after injection of activity needed for reliable PET measurement (10-20 mCi) is well within limits for human research studies.  
The main limitation of  11C-PBR28, shared by [CONTACT_640176], is differential affinity for the target protein [17]. This differential affinity is caused 
by [CONTACT_600388]6971 polymorphism on the  TSPO  gene that causes a non -conservative amino acid 
substitution, resulting in three patterns of TSPO binding. Subjects without the polymorphism 
have high affinity binding for PBR28 and are referred to as  high affinity binders (HABs). 
Homozygotes have low affinity binding and are referred to as low affinity binders (LABs). 
Heterozygotes express both high and low affinity TSPO and are referred to as mixed affinity 
binders (MABs). LABs  are easily identified by [CONTACT_640177]  11C-PBR28 binding  in 
vivo; however, PET cannot easily resolve the difference between HABs and MABs , and MABs  
have, on average, 22% less total  11C-PBR28 binding than HABs [18]. Previous work from our 
laboratory demonstrated that correcting  in vitro  binding data for rs6971 genotype improves the 
ability of  3H-PBR28 to detect differences in TSPO density in schizophrenia and control brain 
tissue [18]. This strategy of  TSPO  genotype correction can be applied to PET imaging to remove 
confounding effects of differences in TSPO affinity. 
We recently demonstrated that 11C-PBR28 binding is greater in AD patients than in MCI 
patients or older controls[ 19]. Areas with greatest binding included parietal and temporal 
cortices, reg ions with high amyloid burden. No difference in binding was seen in cerebellum, a 
region typi[INVESTIGATOR_640157]. However, 11C-PBR28 binding did not correlate with 
PIB binding, suggesting a disassociation between inflammation and amyloid burden, particularly 
in more severe patients. Instead, 11C-PBR28 binding correlated with brain atrophy and lower 
cognitive scores, suggesting inflammation is associated with neurodegeneration. This study used 
arterial sampling to calculate 11C-PBR28 binding using kinetic modeling and required a 
relatively large sample size (19 AD patients, 10 MCI patients, and 13 controls) due to relatively 
high variance of the PET data to see the reported effect. While kinetic modeling is considered the 
gold standard method of PET quantification, a less invasive method with less variance would be 
preferred to improve subject tolerability and increase statistical power.  
We developed a simplified ratio method using the cerebellum as a pseudo- reference 
region[ 20]. This method calculates standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) similar to methods 
used for other radioligands such as PIB. This method removes the need for arterial sampling and 
increases sensitivity for detecting di fferences in 11C-PBR28 binding among AD and MCI 
patients and healthy controls by [CONTACT_640178]. For example, using the SUVR method we 
were able to detect significantly increased 11C-PBR28 binding in the hippocampus in MCI 
patients, while this differenc e was only at the trend level using the gold standard method. 
We already have preliminary data suggesting that 11C-PBR28 binding increases with AD 
progression. Eleven patients (7 AD, 4 MCI) and [ADDRESS_856625]-mortem examination is required to definitively demonstra te the presence of  
amyloid plaques in suspected cases of AD, PET imaging allows measurement of amyloid burden 
in vivo. 18F-florbetaben ( FBB, formerly know n as BAY94-9172) binds to fi brillar amyloid 
plaques in vivo[21]. FDA approve d for commercial use to exc lude AD. Dosimetry studies have 
shown t
hat radiation exposure from this radioligand is similar to that from other 18F radioligand 
commonly used in human PET studies and clinical pr actice.  
Amyloid PET imaging allows in vivo detection of amyloid plaques to improve risk 
assessment and diagnosis of AD. Therefore, clinical evaluation using current neuroimaging 
techniques can be used to identify the following four groups:  
1) A myloid- positive  with cognitive  im pairment (AD). Amyloid- positive patients who 
a
lready have cognitive impairment are most likely to be clinically expressing AD pathology[22, 
23],
 either in the  prod romal stage  (MCI) or d ementia s ta ge (AD d ementia). P a tients w ith M CI 
who a
re amyloid-positive on PET convert to AD dementia at reported rates as high as 80% 
within 3 ye ars[24, 25]. 
2) A myloid- positive  without im pairment ( pr eclinical AD). Cognitively normal subjects 
who are amyloi d-positive show greater rates of memory decline than those who are amyloid-
negative[26] . These subjects represent a p reclinical s tage of  AD[27]. 
3) Amyloid-negative without impairment (normal aging). Cognitively normal subjects 
who are amyloid-negative on PET, and lack signs of neurodegeneration from other biomarkers, 
have no di scernible evidence of AD pathology[28].  While such subjects may develop 
pathological changes in the future , at the time of inves tigation they represent normal aging. 
4) Amyloid- negative with cogn itive impairment (impairment due t o suspected non -
AD p athophysio
logy). Notably, 29% of elders with MCI in a recent population-based study had 
evidenc e of neurodegeneration wit hout amyl oidosis[29], and longitudina l PET studie s have 
shown tha t amyloid-negati ve MCI patients progres s to dementi a at rates ranging fr om 0 - 23% 
per ye a r [8, 24, 30, 31] . Evidenc e of neur odegeneration (i.e., hippocampa l atrophy on MR I or 
hypometabolis m on FD G PET) without amyloidosi s has been terme d “suspected non- AD 
pat
hophys iology”[32], and subject s wit h this biomarke r profil e are thought to mostly likely 
represe nt patients with non-Alzheimer’ s diagnoses[28]. 
Taken together, thes e four groups may be considered differe nt categorie s of disease along 
the aging spectrum.  
1.2 Investigational Age nt 
11C-PBR28 is a PET radi oligand t hat binds to the 18 kD a tra nslocat or pr otein (TSPO), a 
marker of inflammation. 11C-P BR28 ha s previously been administered in humans.  
18F-Florbetaben (Neuraceq) ha s FDA appr oval for hum an us e in evaluation of Alzheimer’s 
disease. W e wil l use 18F -Florbetaben in thi s study f or research purposes. 
Both radioligands will be administered in tracer doses. 11C-PBR28 will be a dministered at 
activity of up to 20 mCi per injection. 18F-Florbetaben will be administered at activity up to 8.1 
mCi per injection.
 mCi per injection. 
1.3
 Preclinical Data 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
Based on prior human experience and dosimetry 
data, we expect the proposed injected activity of 
11C-PBR28 (up to 20 mCi) to be safe without expected toxicity. 18F-florbetaben is an FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical used here for research purposes at injected activity recommended 
by [CONTACT_3455] (up to 8.1 m Ci). 
[ADDRESS_856626] (known locally as WHICAP, 
R01 AG037212, PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_640158]), the CUMC A lzheimer's Disease Research  Center (ADRC), and [CONTACT_640183]’s Questionable Dementia 2 (QD2) cohort, and CUMC clinics. 
Subjects may also be 
co-enrolled in Columbia University Medical Center protocols AAAO9758 (PI [INVESTIGATOR_640159]), 
AAAI2752 (PI [INVESTIGATOR_640160]), 
AAAQ8249 (PI [INVESTIGATOR_640160]), AAAQ8096 (PI [INVESTIGATOR_640160]), 
AAAR4352 (PI [INVESTIGATOR_640161]) and AAAR6570 (PI [INVESTIGATOR_640162]). Informed consent will be 
obtained prior to study enrol lment. This protoco l will encourage data sharin g to reduce repeat 
procedures and 
thus participant burden. De-id entified neuroimaging data may be shared with 
IRB-approved collaborators. 
PET Imaging has e
nded for this study. Please note that anywhere in the protocol that 
makes mention of PET imaging, a nd its corresponding drugs/biologics (18F-f lorbetaben 
and 11C-PBR28) is only 
in reference t o previous  study design. PET imaging is no longer a 
part 
of the protocol but is kept in for s tudy design comprehension. 
For subjects with cognitive impairment, prior to obtaining 
informed consent, a licensed physician 
who is not listed as personnel on this protocol will determine whether the subjects has capacity to 
provide their own consent. If the subject lacks consent, a legally authorized representative will be 
required to provide consent for the subject. 
Up to [ADDRESS_856627] Clinical Dementia 
Rating  scale score of  0.5 or 1 and m eet cl i nical criteria for  either am nesti c MC I (single or 
multiple -domain)[22] or A lzheimer’s di sease[23] to be included in the cognitively impaired 
category. Therefore, subjects who fulfill screening criteria will be stratifie d into four categories: 
1) a myloid-positive with cogni tive impa irment , 2) amyl oid-positive without impairment, 3) 
amyloid- negative with cognitive impairment, and 4) amyloid-negative without cognitive 
impairment. Hippocampal atrophy on MRI will be inclusionary criteria for group 3 and 
exclusionary for group 4, as neurodegene ration  is a pr erequisite for suspected non- AD 
pathophysiology and inconsistent with normal aging. Screening will include genetic analysis to 
e
xclude subjects homozygous for the rs6971 (Ala147Thr) SNP on the TSPO gene. Homozygous 
subjects ha ve negligible binding on 11C-PBR28 PET imaging and must be excluded; however, 
heterozygotes may be included[18]. We re quest to perform screening procedures, including 18F-
florbetebe n PET, on up to 150 subjects in anticipation of33% screen failure/dropout rate.
Target s ample size for  completers i s 25 amyloid-positive  elders w ith impa ir ment, 25 
amyloid-positive  elders without impairment, 25 amyl oid-negative elders w ithout  impairment, 
and 25 a myloid-negative  elders w ith impa ir ment ( 100 s ubje cts tot al). Results from a popul ation-
based study showed that 43% of M CI patients are amyloid-negative on PET[29], and in a phase 
3 bapi [INVESTIGATOR_640163]-to- moderate AD p atient s, 36% of ApoE4 non- carriers w ere negative 
on baseline amyloid imaging[44]. Therefore, significant oversampling i s not anticipated to be  
necessary f or the impaired am yloid-negative group. Our enrollment goal is 25 subjects per group 
to account  for a 30%  general s creen failure/drop -out rate and  a 9% pr evalence of  low affinity 
binde
rs. Using subj ects f rom W HICAP wi t h pre-determined T SP O affinity status  from GWAS 
will reduc e the screen f ailure rate.  
3.1.2 Neuropsychological data analysis 
Selected neuropsychological tests scores will be combined into four composite scores 
(memory,  language, executive/speed, and visuospatial)[45]. Memory testing will include 
S
elective Reminding  Test an d Benton  Vi sual R etent ion Test (BVRT), Recognition Memory 
Multiple Choice version. Z- scores for each cognitive measure will b e calculated and av eraged t o 
cr
eate a composite z -score for each domain. These factor domain scores will be subsequently 
averaged to produc e a composite cognitive z-score to indicate mean cognition. Higher z-score 
i
ndicates be tter cognitive performance.  
3.1.3. Imaging procedures 
One brain MRI will be performed on each subject using a 3 T Philips scanner. Sequences 
performe d will include 3D T1 (MPRAGE, 180  slice 1 mm r esolution, 256 x 256 voxel count) for 
volumetric analysis and cli nical s equences t o exclude subjects w i th  visible evidence of ce rebral 
amyloid angiopathy (microbleeds on GRE), more than moderate white matter disease on T2, or 
other intracrani al pathology unrelated to AD. PET scans will take place on a Biograph mCT PET 
scanner (Siemens  Healthcare) at t he CUMC K reitchman P ET C enter. S ubjects w i ll have one  18F-
florbetaben (Neuraceq)  PET scan ( up t o 8.1 m Ci) to de termine  amyloid s tatus[46] . S ubjects w ill 
have one PET scan 
with 11C-PBR28 (injected activity 10-20 mCi). PET imaging will be 
performe d without arterial sampling. 11C-PBR [ADDRESS_856628] not yet been validate d for clinical use. S ubjects will be informed if a clinically 
important abnorm ality is de tected on PET imaging (e.g., brain tumor). 
Subjects w ill be  allowed to ta ke low dose lorazepam (0.5 - 1 m g orally one time dose) or 
equivalent dose of alternative benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_640164], Florbetaben PET scan and/or 
PBR28 PET scan in the case that t he subject i s claustrophobic or otherwise unable to lay still 
without pre-medicat ion. Low -dose one-time a dministration  of anxiolytic me dic ation  is 
commonly done in clinical practice when patients have anxiet y about unde rgoing the MRI and/ or 
PET s can. Subjects w ill be  informed of the r isks associated with one- time administration  of low-
dose benzodi
azepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], including sedation, lightheadedness, mot or incoordination,  dif ficulties w ith 
balance , and confusi on. Subjects who rec eive benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_640165] -medication  will be  
accompanied during the appointment by a member of the study staff and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_640166]. Subjects who receive benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_640165]-medication  will be  
instructed not to drive, handle machinery, or drink alcohol until the next day, and will be 
required to bring a companion to escort them home. Standard doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
particularly l orazepam, a re not  expe cted t o affect 11C -PBR28 binding to TSPO[47]. 
3.1.4 Image processing 
FreeSurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), the MRI software package comprising a suite of 
automated tools for segmentation, reconstruction, and derivation of regional volumes and 
surface -based renderi ng, will be used for deri vation of regions-of- interest (ROIs) . Eleven ROIs 
wil
l be extracte d from the structural T1 i mage: entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, inferior tempora l 
cortex, combined superior and middle temporal cortex, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal 
lobule, precuneus, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067], prefrontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus. Age-adjusted 
hippocampal volumes will be used to define the presence or absence of ne urodegeneration [28]. 
A single s tatic 18F -fl orbetaben i mage  acquired 50-[ADDRESS_856629]’s diagnosis. A visual binary read (pos itive or 
negative) w ill be  determined a ccording  to criteria established by P ir amal imaging  to stratify 
subj
ects a s amyloid- positive or am yloid- negative. S emi-quant itative  measurement of  18F -
fl
orbetaben binding will be used as an outcome measure for baseline  amyloid burden (see 
below). 
18F-Florbetaben a nd 11C-PBR28 PET images will be analyzed according t o previously 
publis
hed methods for 11C-PBR28 [19]. In brief, Frees urf er based ROIs will be applied to 
coregistered P ET images. C orrection  for partial v olume effect s usi ng a region-based voxel- wise 
method[48] w ill be  applied.  Regional time -activity curves using 50-70 or  90-110 min of scan 
data for  18F-florbetaben and 60-90 min for 11C-PBR28  will be  extracted f rom the PET s cans, 
including  cerebellum  which w ill be  used as a reference region. Standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR) values will be calculated by [CONTACT_640179] f or each t arget re gion by [CONTACT_640180]  
3.1.5. Blood and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_640167], determined by [CONTACT_640181] n with a pre-existing 
Taqman assay [17-19] in the Bio markers Shared Resource of CUMC. Su bjects will have the 
option of having one lumbar puncture ( LP) for CSF collect ion. Subjects may refuse the LP and 
still participate in the other study proce dures. CSF analysis will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Honig to 
determine C SF concentrations of total tau, phospho-tau, β-amyloid, and markers of inflammation 
such as I L-1β, TNF-α, glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100B, and YLK-40. 
3.1.6. Procedure
s performed in WHICAP 
Procedures that are performed under WHICAP include screenin g interview, history and physical 
examination, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, genome- wide association 
study and diagnosis made at consensus conference. To date, over [ADDRESS_856630] had 
18F-florbeta ben PET. GWAS data will be interrogated to screen 
out subjects homozygous for the rs6971 SNP.

Methodology:  
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 3- part study. Part [ADDRESS_405601] completes Part 1 (through Week 24).  Part 2 is 
designed to primarily evaluate the long-term safety of BCX7353 at 2 dosage levels. Part 3 is 
open- label and designed to primarily evaluate the long -term safety of BCX7353. Parts 1, 2, and 3 will 
be conducted in sequence, with Parts 2 and 3 conducted as continuous roll-overs from Parts 1 and 2, respectively. All subjects will receive BCX7353 in Parts 2 and 3, including those randomized to 
receive placebo in Part 1. Based on the results of the current study’s Part 1 analysis of greater efficacy 
and no increase in safety  or tolerability  risk at the 150 mg dose vs. the 110 mg dose, all subjects will 
be transitioned to the 150 mg dose of BCX7353 on or after their Week 48 visit, regardless of their 
initial or Week 24 treatment allocation.  
Part 1 (24- week evaluation of blinded efficacy and safety)  
Patients with HAE Type 1 or 2 will be eligible for the study following assessment of data obtained 
from screening procedures, including demonstration of a minimum number of attacks documented 
during a prospective run -in period of 2 to 8 weeks from the date of the screening visit.  
Treatment -eligible subjects will receive study drug (BCX7353 or placebo) in Part 1 of the study based 
on randomization in a 1:1:1 (active: active: placebo) ratio into 1 of 3 treatment groups:  
• Group 1: BCX7353 110 mg administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
• Group 2: BCX7353 150 mg administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
• Group 3: Placebo administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
Enrollment into treatment groups will be stratified by [CONTACT_166697] H AE attack rate (≥  2 attacks/month 
vs. < 2 attacks/month).  
Beginning at screening and through the Week 48 visit, details of acute attacks of angioedema will be 
recorded in an electronic diary (e -diary). Attacks will be treated in accordance with the subject’s 
normal standard of care. Treatment medications for angioedema attacks will not be provided by [CONTACT_429]. 
Within approximately 2 business days of the end of each attack that occurs beginning at the screening 
visit through the Week 48 visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_108866] (or appropriately trained 
designee) to discuss the clinical characteristics of the attack, any questions the Investigator has on the 
entered data, or to gain additional attack details not included in the e -diary that the Investigator deems 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_405602] include symptoms of swelling; prodromal symptoms in the absence of swelling are not considered HAE attacks, regardless of 
treatment. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling.  
The main study will be comprised of adult subjects (≥ 18 years of age); a substudy in participating 
regions will be inc luded that allows adolescent subjects ≥ 12 to 17 years of age to screen and enroll. 
Main study and substudy subjects will be randomized via a separate randomization scheme; however, 
study- mandated procedures will be identical, and analyses will include all  subjects who participate in 
the study.  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessments of AEs, laboratory analyses (clinical 
chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical 
examinations.   
Study visits in Part [ADDRESS_405603], site, and Sponsor staff interacting with sites during Part 2.  
Part 2 ( 24-week evaluation of safety of blinded BCX7353) 
Part 2 of the study will start with the administration of the study drug dispensed at the Week 24 visit.  
Subjects in Groups 1 and 2 will continue to receive the same BCX7353 dose to which they were 
randomized in Part 1 of the study in a blinded manner. Subjects randomized to Group 3 (placebo) will undergo a second randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 110 or 150 mg dose in a blinded 
manner beginning at the Week 24 visit (see figure below for visual depi[INVESTIGATOR_328503]). The active dose a subject receives in Part 2 will be blinded for all subjects; subjects will be 
informed that they will receive an active dose of BCX7353 in Part 2. 
Study visits during Part [ADDRESS_405604] regular visits to assess safety and tolerability; Investigator 
confirmation of attacks will continue to be required for Part 2. Interim safety analyses will be conducted while Part 2 is ongoing to support regulatory fili ngs. 
Part 3 ( up to 96-week evaluation of safety of open-label BCX7353) 
Part 3 of the study will start with the administration of the study drug dispensed at the Week 48 visit. Based on the results of the current study’s Part 1 analysis of greater  efficacy and no increase in safety 
or tolerability risk at the 150 mg dose vs. the 110 mg dose , all subjects will be  transitioned to the 
150 mg dose of BCX7353 on or after their Week 48 visit , regardless of their initial or Week  24 
treatment allocation. 
 
Study visits during Part 3 will occur during Weeks 60, 72, 84, 96 and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter, for a study duration of up to 144 weeks (approximately 3 years), or until another 
mechanism is available to provide drug to the subject (eg, market access) or the Sponsor discontinues 
development of the product for the prevention of angioedema attacks, whichever comes first.

Number of subjects (planned):  
Approximately 96 subjects will be enrolled in this study (n = 32/group), which includes any 
adolescent subjects enrolled in the substudy.  
A blinded interim analysis is planned to estimate the standard deviation from the pooled treatment 
groups after 50% of the subjects complete Part 1 of the study (through 24 weeks). The sample size 
may be re-estimated based on the variability from the pooled data.  
The final sample size will be the maximum of either the original planned sample size (32 per group) 
or the r e-estimated sample size. No statistical adjustment for the final analysis is planned.  
Main criteria for inclusion:  
1. Males and non-pregnant, non- lactating females ≥ 18 years of age (main study) or ≥ 12 to 
17 years of age (substudy).   
2. Able to provide written, informed consent. Subjects aged [ADDRESS_405606] weight of ≥ 40 kg.  
4. A clinical dia gnosis of hereditary angioedema Type I or II, defined as having a C1- esterase 
inhibitor (C1- INH) functional level below 50% and a complement 4 (C4) level below the 
lower limit of the normal (LLN) reference range, as assessed during the Screening period.  
• In the absence of a low C4 value drawn during the intercritical period (ie, subject is not 
having an HAE attack), 1 of the following is acceptable to confirm the diagnosis of HAE: 
1) a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene mutation known or likely to be associated with HAE Type I or II 
assessed during the screening period; 2) a confirmed family history of C1- INH 
deficiency; 3) a C4 redrawn and retested during an attack in the screening period with the results below the LLN reference range.  

Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 11 • For subjects with C1 -INH function ≥  50% but <  assay LLN, a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene mutation 
known or likely to be associated with HAE Type I or II, as assessed during the screening 
period OR a repeat C1- INH functional level <  50% will be considered acceptable for 
enrollment.  
5. Access to and ability to use one or more acute medications approved by [CONTACT_328535] (icatibant, plasma-derived 
C1-INH, ecallantide, or recombinant C1 -INH). Cinryze used for acute treatment of HAE 
attacks is an acceptable medication for this purpose. 
6. Subjects must be medically appropriate for on -demand treatment as the sole medicinal 
management for their HAE during the study.  
7. The subject must have at least 2 HAE attacks which meet all the requirements below during

• The attacks are unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 48 hours 
of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be documented 
to cause functional impairment based on subject entry in the diary. Functional 
impairment is defined as the subject not being able to perform their daily activities 
without restriction (ie, subject records that they are at least slightly rest ricted in their 
daily activities during their HAE attack).  
• The attacks must include symptoms of swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions 
which are indicative of internal swelling. 
• The attacks are otherwise confirmed by [CONTACT_328536].    
Subjects who have recorded 2 such attacks may be randomized to receive study drug 
beginning on or after Day 28 of the run- in period; subjects who have recorded at least [ADDRESS_405607] meet the 
inclusion criteria regarding contraception, and contraception of female partners (as 
applicable) , as outlined in Section 8.2.1.  
Note: Contraception is no longer required for male subjects and their female partners under 
Protocol Version 3.0.  
9. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject is expected to adequately comply with all required study procedures for the duration of the study. The subject must demonstrate 
adequate compliance with all study procedures required from t he screening visit through 
randomization, including diary recording of HAE attacks beginning at the Screening visit. 
Main criteria for exclusion:  
1. Any clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or medical history that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_12182], would interfere with the subject’s ability to participate in the study or increases the risk to the subject by [CONTACT_6231].  
2. Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition, or stay in an institution further to an official or court order that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or participation in the study.

kinase-MB, troponin I and T, neutrophil gelatinase -associated lipocalin ), vital signs, ECGs, and 
physical examinations. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will periodically review safety data in accordance with a DMC Charter . Relationships between safe ty assessment findings and 
human leukocyte antigen typi[INVESTIGATOR_328505] a meta-study basis.  
Health Outcomes:  
AE-QoL, EQ -5D- 5L, TSQM , WPAI questionnaire scores.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Kallikrein inhibition.  Additional exploratory assays to elucidate PD properties of BCX7353 may also be conducted on 
plasma samples drawn for PD analyses.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK):   
A blood sample for BCX7353 concentration will be drawn. Population PK of BCX7353 will be 
evaluated o n a meta -study basis.  
Statistical methods:  
The primary study hypothesis is that the rate of HAE attacks during 24 weeks of prophylactic BCX7353 (at either 150  or 110 mg QD) will be superior to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint is 
the monthly investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate in the entire treatment period (Day 1 [post-dose] 
to Day 168) in the intent- to-treat population, which includes all randomized subjects. 
Each BCX7353 dose will be compared to placebo in the primary analysis. The primary analysis of 
treatment -effect will be performed using a Poisson regression model. The stratification variable 
(baseline monthly attack rate) will be included as a covariate and the logarithm of duration on treatment will be included as an offset variable. The estimated treatment differences in attack rate 
ratio (BCX7353 over placebo rate ratio) and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be provided. Monthly will be defined as [ADDRESS_405613] 94% power to detect a 
≥ 50% attack rate reduction (a treatment difference of 0.5 units) between BCX7353 and placebo, 
based on a 2-sided test at significance level of 0.05. To account for multiplicity, the Hochberg step-up 
procedure will be used to adjust for the [ADDRESS_405614] ..................................................46

 25 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1 -esterase inhibitor (C1 -INH) deficiency is an autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_281895], pharynx, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, genitals, and extremities ( Longhurst and Cicardi 2012) . The frequency 
of attacks varies between subjects, from rarely in some patients to every few days in others. 
Angioedema attacks may or may not be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_216020] a stimulus (such as stress, trauma, or 
estrogen) and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_281896], with symptoms subsiding gradually over the following 
3 to 5 days ( Zuraw  and Christiansen 2011) . Oropharyngeal swelling can be life-threatening 
(Bork, Hardt et al. 2012) , while attacks in other s ites, including limbs, genitalia, face and 
intestines, can be painful, disabling, and disfiguring, and have a significant impact on functionality and quality of life (QoL) (Lumry, Castaldo et al. 2010) . Although mortality risk 
from asphyxiation is much higher in undiagnosed patients with HAE, deaths still occur in diagnosed patients with access to care at centers of excellence ( Bork, Hardt et al. 2012) . 
Extensive evidence from animal models and clinical studies supports the role of bradykinin (BK) as the principal mediator of the signs and symptoms that characterize attacks of HAE ( Han, 
MacFarlane et al. 2002 , Kaplan 2010, Zuraw and Christiansen 2011) . Plasma kallikrein is a 
serine protease integral to the contact [CONTACT_84239] ( Saxena, Thompson et al. 2011) . 
Kallikrein circulates in plasma as a zymogen, prekallikrein (PKK),  bound to one of its main 
substrates, high- molecular -weight kininogen (HK). During contact [CONTACT_84188], PKK is cleaved by 
[CONTACT_281942], forming the active protease kallikrein. Kallikrein in turn cleaves HK, producing BK ( Kaplan and Ghebrehiwet 2010) . The activation of the bradykinin B2 receptor by 
[CONTACT_328537], increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle 
contraction, all of which lead to the tissue swelling that characterizes HAE ( Kaplan 2010) .  
BCX7353 is a potent, synthetic small molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. In contrast to 
parenterally administered options commercially available for prophylaxis against HAE attacks, 
inhibition of kallikrein with an orally bioavailable small molecule such as BCX7353 offers the advantage of oral administration. 
5.2. Nonclinical Findings for BCX7353 
The principal results of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicology studies of BCX7353 are described briefly below; additional details can be found in the BCX7353 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Safety pharmacology studies of BCX7353 indicated multiple cardiac ion channel effects, including the human ether-a-go- go related gene K
+ channel and the Na+ and Ca2+ channels. 
However, studies in non-human primates (NHP) showed quantitatively small drug- related 
prolongation of the QT interval. There were no concerns for phototoxicity or genotoxicity. 
Embryo- fetal developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit sh owed no evidence of direct 
fetal toxicity of BCX7353, and no effects were seen in male and female rats in fertility studies. Chronic-dosing toxicology studies were conducted in the NHP (39 weeks) and rat (26 weeks). 
BCX7353 was well tolerated in both rats and monkeys at doses up 30 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively, and these dose levels were the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs). In 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 26 NHP, at the NOAEL dose of 30 mg/kg/day, mean maximal plasma concentration of the drug 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) 
on Day 270 (sexes combined) were 277 ng/mL and 3950 ng.h/mL, respectively. In the rat, at the 
NOAEL dose level of 20 mg/kg/day, C max was 686 ng/mL, and AUC 0-24 was 9710 ng.h/mL, on 
Day 182.  
In the chronic toxicology study in rats the target organ was the liver. Minimal to mild bile duct 
hyperplasia and foamy/pi[INVESTIGATOR_328507] 20 mg/kg/day. Vacuolated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_328508]. A patholo gy peer- review of 
liver findings in the 26-week study concluded that the microscopic changes, including bile duct 
hyperplasia, were non- adverse.  
In monkeys, the primary target organs were the liver and kidney. In one study that evaluated doses up to 20 mg/kg/day, the only effect noted was a mild increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which partially resolved during the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_147737]. In a subsequent study 
that evaluated doses of 30, 55, and 80 mg/kg/day, adverse findings in the liver and kidney were 
noted at 55 and 80 mg/kg/day. Increased liver weights and panlobular hepatocellular hypertrophy were observed together with increased ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST); and increased 
kidney weights, renal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_328509], and renal tubular hyperplasia were also 
observed. Each of these effects were reversible during a 13- week drug -free recovery period.  
In monkeys, pi[INVESTIGATOR_328510], in mesenteric lymph nodes and in liver Kupffer cells at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day in 
females, and at doses ≥ 55 mg/kg/day in males. Dose -dependent increases in the urinary 
concentrations of the experimental biomarker for phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD), di-docosahexaenoyl 
(22:6)- Bis(mo no) acylglycerol phosphate (BMP), were observed in both rats and monkeys. 
Electron microscopy evaluation of liver from rats in the 13-week toxicity studies demonstrated 
myelinosomes within the cytoplasm of Kupffer cells. These effects are consistent with P LD, a 
phenomenon noted in nonclinical toxicity studies with several approved drugs. PLD is considered an adaptive response to the presence of a drug, rather than a toxic manifestation.  
In monkeys, spleen and thymus weights were increased at 55 and 80 mg/kg/day. The increased 
spleen weight correlated with lymphoid hyperplasia; there was no microscopic correlate for the 
increased thymus weights. 
5.3. Clinical Findings for BCX7353 
A clinical  program, including a comprehensive clinical pharmacology program of Phase 1 
studies and 2 Phase 2 clinical studies (BCX7353-203 [CSR available; results s ummarized herein ] 
and BCX7353-204 [ongoing]) relevant to the current study have been conducted. One Phase 3 study (BCX7353-301) remains ongoing in Japan.   
The principal results of clinical pharmacology, PK, and clinical safety and efficacy studies of 
BCX7353 are described in the BCX7353 IB.

 27 5.3.1. Summary of Ongoing Study BCX7353-302 
The primary objective of the current study (BCX7353-302) was to determine the efficacy of 
prophylactic BCX7353 150 and 110 mg administered orally once daily (QD) for 24 weeks 
(Part  1) compared to placebo in subjects with HAE. Parts 2 and 3 are ongoing. 
In Part 2, all subjects receive active treatment with BCX7353 from Weeks 25 through 48, and 
Protocol Version 4.0, Part 3 extends treatment with BCX7353 up to 144 ([LOCATION_002] only) or 
240 (Europe and Canada) weeks. Results for Part  1 are summarized herein.  
Overall, a total of 160 subjects were screened, 121  subjects were randomized (stratified by 
[CONTACT_281944], < 2 vs. ≥ 2 per 28 days), and 120 randomized subjects (99%) were treated. Of these, 108 subjects completed 24 weeks of study drug dosing in Part 1: 37 of 40 BCX7353 150 mg subjects (93%), 37 of 41 BCX7353 110 mg subjects (90%), and 34 of 39 placebo subjects (87%). 
The mean baseline rate was 2.98 attacks per month. The majority of subjects (70%) had ≥ 
2 attacks per month at baseline, and the attack frequency was generally well distributed across the 3 treatment groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing 
in the entire 24-week treatment period. This study achieved its primary endpoint for both dose 
levels, with the 150 and 110 mg doses reducing HAE attacks by 44% (p < 0.001) and 
30% (p  = 0.024), respectively, vs. placebo. The attack rate per [ADDRESS_405625] 4 weeks and stable over the entire 24-week duration of Part 1. 
Secondary endpoints (change from baseline in the angioedema quality of life questionnaire 
[AE-QoL], number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms, and rate of 
investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the effective dosing period [beginning on Day 8 
through Week 24]) were analyzed using hierarchical testing. Results for the first secondary 
endpoint, AE-QoL, were not statistically significant vs. placebo for either treatment group; therefore, inferential statistical testing was not performed on the descending secondary efficacy 
endpoints. For placebo, subjects experienced least square means (LSM) of 19.7% of days with 
symptoms compared with 11.9% for BCX7353 150 mg (nominal p = 0.006) and 13.4% for 110 mg (nominal p = 0.025). The rate of investigator-confirmed HAE a ttacks during the effective 
dosing period was reduced by 46.5% for 150 mg BCX7353 (nominal p < 0.001) and by 30.4% for 110 mg (nominal p = 0.026). 
BCX7353 significantly reduced the use of standard of care acute attack medication per 28 days 
vs. placebo by 53.6% ( nominal p < 0.001) for 150 mg and 46.3% (nominal p < 0.001) for 
110 mg. In responder analyses, 58%, 50%, and 23% of subjects receiving 150 mg BCX7353 had 
a ≥ 50%, ≥ 70% or ≥  90% reduction in their HAE attack rates compared to baseline vs. 25%, 
15%, and 8% of placebo subjects, nominal p = 0.005, nominal p = 0.002, and nominal p = 0.073, respectively.  
Administration of BCX7353 at doses of [ADDRESS_405626] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 28 Overall 81.7% of subjects experienced a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) on study: 
85.0% of 150 mg subjects, 82.9% of 110 mg subjects, and 76.9% of placebo subjects; 39.5% of 
BCX7353-treated subjects and 33.3% of placebo subjects experienced a drug- related TEAE. 
Five subjects discontinued study drug due to TEAEs: 1 (2.5%) on 150 mg, 3 (7.3%) on 110 mg, 
and 1 (2.6%) on placebo. No subjects on [ADDRESS_405627] on 110 mg (2.4%), and 3 subjects on 
placebo (7.7%) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs)  on study; none of these events were 
drug related. All drug-related TEAEs were mild to moderate on placebo and in the 150 mg 
group, and the majority of TEAEs in the 110 mg group were mild to moderate; 3/41 (7.3%) 
[ADDRESS_405628] common TEAEs across all arms were nasopharyngitis, nausea, and vomiting. Overall, 
50.0% and 41.5% of BCX7353 150 and 110 mg subjects, respectively, had GI 
abdominal-associated TEAEs vs. 35.9% of placebo subjects. There were no drug- related rashes 
(events of special interest [EOSI]).  
Orally administered BCX7353 was a generally safe, well tolerated, and effective treatment for the prevention of HAE attacks in Part 1 of this study, with greater  efficacy at the 150 mg dose 
compared to the 110 mg dose, and no increase in safety or tolerability  risk.  
5.3.2. Summary of Study BCX7353-203 
The results of the Phase 2 trial, Study BCX7353-203, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine  (Aygoren-Pursun, By[CONTACT_281948]. 2018) . In summary, this Phase 2 sequential 
dose de- escalating, randomized, placebo -controlled study evaluated 4 dose levels of BCX7353 
administered QD for 28 days: 350, 250, 125, and 62.5 mg (salt nomencl ature [SN]). As reported 
in the publication: 
“The APeX -[ADDRESS_405629] observed at the 125 -mg dose: the attack rate was 73.8% lower than with 
placebo, and 43% of patients were attack -free.”  
The data suggest that the efficacy of the BCX7353 doses of 250 mg and 350 m g was 
probably masked by [CONTACT_328538] [AEs] that may have been misattributed as early 
symptoms of abdominal angioedema attacks. Only the 125-mg dose group had a lower 
rate of abdominal attacks than the placebo group, whereas all groups that received BCX7353 at doses of 125 mg or more had lower rates of peripheral attacks than the 
placebo group (difference, 68% to 82%). GI AEs were more common at the doses of 
[ADDRESS_405630] profile in this trial was consistent with a trial involving healthy volunteers, in 
which GI AEs were more commonly reported in higher BCX7353 dose groups 
(Cornpropst, Dobo et al. 2016) . The effectiveness of BCX7353 was further supported by 
[CONTACT_328539] a post hoc hierarchical analysis, with substantial improvements observed in patients’ QoL at the 125-mg dose level, although post hoc 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 29 P-values should be interpreted with some caution. The mean improvement (change from 
baseline) in the AE -QoL total score was > 4 times the minimal clinically important 
difference [MCID] of 6 point s (Weller, Magerl et al. 2016 ).” 
5.3.3. Data Monitoring Committee Review of Ongoing Studies BCX7353- 302, 
BCX7353-301, and BCX7353-204 
Data from Studies BCX7353-204, BCX7353-301, and the current study, BCX7353-302, are 
reviewed by [CONTACT_281936]7353 data monitoring committee (DMC) at protocol- specified intervals.  
The latest  data review  as of the time of the protocol amendment, 30 July 2019, by [CONTACT_281936]7353 
DMC included 120 dosed subjects on Study BCX7353-302, 226 dosed subjects on 
Study BCX7353-204, and 19 dosed subjects on Study BCX7353-301 with 315 subjects receiv ing 
study treatment for > 84 days (> 12 weeks).  
The recommendation of the DMC was that all  studies proceed per protocol.  
5.4. Rationale for Study  
Currently, the only prophylactic treatments approved for prevention of angioedema attacks in 
HAE are oral androgens , parenteral C1 -INH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of 
plasma kallikrein. While patient experience has improved with the expansion of approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_98234], an orphan disease, a 2013 survey of 245 [LOCATION_002] ( US) physicians that 
treat HAE indicated that their perception is that only 40% of their patients are fully satisfied with 
current HAE treatments ( Riedl, Banerji et al. 2013) . Regular IV infusions of C1- INH for 
prophylactic use in HAE may lead to an increase in complications over time, such as thrombosis, infection, pain and limited venous access ( Shire  ViroPharma  Inc. 2018 ). The currently approved 
formulation of subcutaneous (SC) C1-INH for prophylaxis of HAE attacks requires 13 steps to 
prepare the drug for administration and approximately 8 to 10 mL of drug to be administered 
twice weekly based on an adult weight range of 67 to 83 kg. This medication also requires slow administration into the SC space over a length of time considered comfortable for the patient 
(CSL Behring LLC 2017) . Lanadelumab -flyo, a monoclonal antibody and plasma kallikrein 
inhibitor, was recently approved in the US for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE 
(Shire  2018) . It is administered via SC injection and patients or caregivers must be trained by a 
healthcare professional prior to use. Hypersensitivity is a risk associated with lanadelumab -flyo, 
and in clinical trials, 52% of patients who took the drug experienced inj ection site reactions 
(primarily pain, erythema, and bruising at the injection site). Even patients with HAE with no 
contraindications to androgens and who tolerate prophylactic androgens face long- term risks 
with continued treatment . Therefore, there remains a significant medical need to provide 
additional HAE treatment options that are efficacious, convenient, and well- tolerated.  
BCX7353 is an oral kallikrein inhibitor in development for prevention of angioedema attacks in 
patients with HAE Type I and II. BCX7353 has activity against plasma kallikrein at low nM 
concentrations (Section  5.2) that are attainable and sustained in humans following oral 
administration. In  both Part 1 of the current study and the proof-of- concept 28-day 
study BCX7353-203 (APeX-1), the rate of angioedema attacks in subjects randomized to BCX7353 was statistically significantly lower than in placebo subjects and BCX7353 was 
generally safe and well -tolerated. These data support further clinical development of BCX7353 
as a potential future option for prophylaxis of HAE attacks.

 30 5.4.1. Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of 2 doses of BCX7353 compared to placebo in 
preventing attacks in subjects  with Type I and II HAE, as measured by [CONTACT_328540]-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the entire 24-week treatment period in 
Part 1. The current study expands upon the scope of Study BCX7353-203 by [CONTACT_328541]7353 over a longer duration (24 weeks in Part 1) relative to placebo in a greater number of subjects per dose (approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled in each dose group). Moreover, in the current study, the efficacy of BCX7353 will be evaluated in an HAE 
population potentially characterized by a wider range of attack frequency (minimum of 2 attacks 
in 8 weeks are required for entry). The current study will be conducted as a parallel cohort assessment of active doses vs. placebo. A parallel cohort design, in contrast to a crossover study 
design, reduces the number of important statistical assumptions and eliminates the concern of 
any carryover effects from one treatment period to another. However, greater than anticipated variance in attack rates in 1 or more groups may invalidate the power calculation and sample size 
chosen at the outset of the study. For this reason, a blinded sample size re- estimation is included 
in accordance with the FDA Guidance Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics 
(DHHS 2010 ).  
Subjects randomized to Treatment Groups [ADDRESS_405631] of Part 2, the blinded extension on active drug, in part satisfies regulatory authorities’ 
requirement to obtain safety data over an extended treatment duration given that the BCX7353 will be ultimately administered as a chronic therapy. The doses of BCX7353 will remain blinded during Part [ADDRESS_405632] of Part 3, an unblinded extension on active drug, provides additional safety and 
effectiveness data over an extended treatment duration.  
5.4.2. Rationale for BCX7353 Doses and Regimen 
The BCX7353 dosage regimens selected for evaluation in this study are 110 and 150 mg 
BCX7353 administered QD (equivalent to 125 mg and 150 mg QD [SN]).  
In Study BCX7353-203, the HAE attack rate was significantly lower vs. placebo in subjects who received d aily doses of 125, 250, or 350 mg BCX7353 (SN) and the drug was well- tolerated. The 
plasma drug levels achieved at each dose were generally predictable and had an acceptable level of inter- subject variability.  
Two doses (110 mg QD and 150 mg QD) were studied in the Part 1 (24- week) analysis of the 
current study BCX7353-302 and in versions of BCX7353-204 (Versions 1-5). In Part [ADDRESS_405633] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 31 HAE attacks by 44% (p < 0.001) and 30% (p = 0.024), respectively, vs. placebo. Orally 
administered BCX7353 was a generally safe, well -tolerated, and effective treatment for the 
prevention of HAE attacks in Part 1 of the current  study, with greater efficacy at the 150  mg dose 
compared to the 110 mg dose, and no increase in safety or tolerability risk.  
Based on the results of the current study’s Part 1 analysis of greater efficacy and no increase in 
safety or tolerability risk at the 150 mg dose vs. the 110 mg dose, all subjects will be transitioned to the 150 mg dose of BCX7353 on or after their Week 48 visit, regardless of their initial or Week 24 treatment allocation.  
5.4.3. Study Population Rationale  
The current study is limited to adults and adolescents (≥  12 years of age) of both sexes with HAE 
Types I and II. Children < 12 years of age are excluded from participation in BCX7353 clinical 
trials until the benefit-risk profile in adults and adolescents has been better characterized. Population PK modeling of PK data generated to date indicate that weight is a covariate on the bioavailability of BCX7353. Simulations of exposures by [CONTACT_328542] a weight of < 40 kg is associated with exposures considered significantly higher 
(ie, > 20%) than that generated from an adult of [ADDRESS_405634] 40  kg. At a 
weight of 40 kg, simulated exposure was well within the efficacious exposures identified in Study BCX7353- 203 that were well -tolerated; therefore, it is anticipated that exposure in 
adolescent subjects will not exceed safe and tolerable exposures  in adults.  
Based on past and ongoing studies conducted in HAE patients, it is anticipated that female subjects will comprise at least 50% of the subject population in this study. HAE affects both males and females, although the disease has a greater burden on females, with an increased 
frequency and severity of HAE attacks in women (Bork, Meng et al. 2006, Lumry, Castaldo et 
al. 2010) . Estrogen appears to worsen the disease, as evidenced by [CONTACT_281950]-containing therapy is initiated (Bouillet, Longhurst et al. 2008, Caballero, Farkas et al. 2012) . Due to the gender distribution of 
HAE and the influence of hormones on the frequency of attacks, it is considered important to 
include both male and female subjects in this clinical study to gain an assessment of potential safety and population PK differ ences.  
Although there is no evidence of embryo-fetal developmental toxicity with BCX7353 in reproductive toxicology studies (Section 5.2) , appropr iate precautions are still warranted with 
respect to administering BCX7353 to women of reproductive age, in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Women of childbearing potential may be enrolled in this study provided the y meet the contraceptive requirements and have a negative 
pregnancy test (Section  8.2.1).  
Pregnant women will be excluded from participation in the current study. Additionally, any female subject who becomes pregnant on study will be required to immediately discontinue study drug and will be followed through the end of the pregnancy (see Section 12.1.6).   
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_405635] access to medications for treating attacks ( Cicardi, Bork et al. 2012, Zuraw, Banerji et al. 2013) .  
While there are approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_328511] (EU) for prophylaxis against 
HAE attacks, including C1-INH, consensus recommendations do not exist for either prophylactic 
treatment as a standard of care or a definition of indications for prophylaxis. A guideline published on the management of HAE by [CONTACT_328543] ( Zuraw, Banerji et 
al. 2013) : 
‘The decision about when to use long-term prophylactic treatment cannot be made on rigid criteria but should reflect the needs of the individual patient. Decisions regarding which 
patients should be considered for long-term prophylaxis should take into account attack frequency, attack severity, comorbid conditions, access to emergent treatment, and patient experience and preference.’  
Therefore, a subject randomized to placebo in the current study who has access to effective attack medications is considered to be treated in-line with current guidelines. Nevertheless, these 
guidelines acknowledge that the medical management of HAE in some subjects is best suited by 
[CONTACT_328544]. Therefore, patients who need prophylaxis to manage their HAE will not be considered appropriate for this study.   
To safeguard against enrolling subjects who need prophylaxis, subjects must meet an inclusion 
criterion assessing whether they are medically appropriate for on -demand treatment as the sole 
medicinal management for their HAE during the study. The informed consent and assent for this study will inform subjects on available prophylactic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_328512]; there must be medical and 
personal choice reasons to do so. If a subject has voluntarily discontinued prophylactic therapy 
outside of the specified window (see below) in advance of the Screening visit for medical or personal choice reasons, then they may be screened for study eligibility.  
Use of androgens, or tranexamic acid for prophylaxis of HAE attacks are not allowed within 
28 days of the s creening visit; C1 -INH prophylaxis is not permitted within [ADDRESS_405636] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 33 5.4.5. BCX7353 Benefit -Risk  Analysis 
Given that BCX7353 is a small molecule kallikrein inhibitor with safety data available from 
completed Phase 1 and 2 studies, and Part 1 (24 weeks) of this randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study, there is an acceptably low risk of severe or serious adver se 
reactions. Potential risks and findings from nonclinical and clinical studies of BCX7353 are discussed in Section 6 of the IB (Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigators ).  
5.4.6. Benefits of Trial Participation  
Study subjects will receive regular medical care for the duration of the study. Subjects may experience a reduction in the number of attacks if they are randomized to a BCX7353 treatment. 
The development of BCX7353 is expected to be of benefit to the wider community/patients with 
HAE.  
5.4.7. Overall B enefit -Risk Assessment  
The risks from daily oral administration of BCX7353 seen to date in both nonclinical and clinical 
studies were primarily mild, monitorable, and reversible. Based on the utility of other kallikrein 
inhibitors such as C1-INH and the pharmacology of BCX7353, and Phase [ADDRESS_405637]. The 
information obtained from this study will support the development of BCX7353 for HAE, a 
serious, debilitating, and potentially life- threatening disease. The overall benefit -risk balance is 
therefore considered to be acceptable.

designed to primarily evaluate the long-term safety of BCX7353 at 2 dosage levels. Part 3 is 
open-label and designed to primarily evaluate the long-term safety of BCX7353. Parts 1, 2, and 3 will be conducted in sequence, with Parts 2 and 3 conducted as continuous roll- overs from 
Parts  1 and 2, respectively. All subjects will receive BCX7353 in Parts 2 and 3, including those 
randomized to receive placebo in Part 1 . Based on the results of the current study’s Part 1 
analysis of greater efficacy and no increase in safety or tolerability risk at the 150 mg dose vs. 
the 110 mg dose, all subjects will be transitioned to the 150 mg dose of BCX7353 on or after 
their Week 48 visit, regardless of their initial or Week 24 treatment allocation.  
Part 1 (24-week evaluation of blinded efficacy and safety) 
Patients with HAE Type 1 or 2 will be eligible for the study following assessment of data 
obtained from screening procedures, including demonstration of a minimum number of attacks 
documented during a prospective run-in period of 2 to 8 weeks from the date of the screening visit.  
Approximately 96 treatment- eligible subjects will receive study drug (BCX7353 or placebo) in 
Part 1 of the study based on randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of 3 treatment groups: 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 35        Group 1 (N=32):  BCX7353 110 mg administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
       Group 2 (N=32):  BCX7353 150 mg administered orally QD for 24 weeks        Group 3 (N=32):  Placebo administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
Enrollment into treatment groups will be stratified by [CONTACT_328545] 
(≥ 2 attacks/month vs. < 2 attacks/month).  
Qualifying attacks during the run- in are characterized as follows:  
• The attacks must occur during the run-in period, which is a minimum of 
14 consecutive days and a maximum of 56 consecutive days, starting on the day of the screening visit.  
• The attacks are unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 
48 hours of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be 
documented to cause functional impairment, based on the subject's entry in the diary. 
Functional impairment is defined as the subject not being able to perform their daily 
activities without restriction (ie, subject records that they are at least slightly 
restricted in their daily activities during their HAE attack).  
• The attacks must include symptoms of swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling. 
• The attacks are otherwise confirmed b y the Investigator to be HAE attacks.  
Once a subject records 2 such attacks, they may be randomized to study drug beginning on or after Day 28 of the run-in period; subjects having at least 3 such attacks may be randomized to study drug beginning on or after Day 14 of the run-in period. A study schematic can be found in Figure 1.  
Beginning at screening and through the Week 48 visit, details of acute attacks of angioedema will be recorded in an electronic diary (e- diary). Attacks will be treated in accordance with the 
subject’s normal standard of care. Within approximately 2 business days of the end of each attack that occurs from the screening visit thro ugh the Week 48 visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_328546] (or appropriately trained designee) to discuss the clinical characteristics of the 
attack, any questions on the entered data or to gain additional attack details not included in the 
e-diary that the Investigator deems important to clinically evaluate the event, as applicable. This 
information, in conjunction with the e-diary record, will be used by [CONTACT_328547]. All Investigator- confirmed attacks of 
HAE must include symptoms of swelling; prodromal symptoms in the absence of swelling are 
not considered HAE attacks, regardless of treatment. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to 
visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which 
are indicative of internal swelling.   
The main study will be comprised of adult subjects (aged ≥ 18 years of age); a substudy in 
participating regions will be included that allows adolescent subjects (≥ 12 to 17 years of age) to 
screen and enroll. Main study and substudy subjects will be randomized via a separate 
Protocol BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
 36 randomization scheme; however, study-mandated procedures will be identical, and the analyses 
will include all subjects who participate in the study . 
A blinded interim analysis may be performed to estimate the standard deviation (SD) from the pooled treatment groups after 50% of the subjects complete 24 weeks. The sample size may be 
re-estimated based on the variability from the pooled data. The final sample size will be the 
maximum of either the original planned sample size (32 per group) or the re- estimated sample 
size. No statistical adjustment for the final analysis is planned.  
Study visits in Part [ADDRESS_405640], site, and 
Sponsor staff interacting with sites on a regular basis during Part 2. 
Part 2 (24-week evaluation of safety of blinded BCX7353) 
Part 2 of the study will start with the  administration of study drug dispensed at the Week 24 visit. 
Subjects in Groups 1 and 2 will continue to receive the same BCX7353 dose to which they were 
randomized in Part 1 of the study in a blinded manner. Subjects randomized to Group 3 (placebo) will undergo a second randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 110 or 150 mg dose in a blinded manner beginning at the Week 24 visit ( see Figure 1 ). The active dose a subject 
receives in Part 2 will be blinded for all subjects; subjects will be informed that they will receive an active dose of BCX7353 in Part 2. 
Study visits in Part [ADDRESS_405641] regular visits to assess safety and tolerability; Investigator confirmation of attacks will continue to be required for Part 2.

Approximately 96 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study, which includes any adolescent patients enrolled in the substudy; additional subjects may be required after the 
potential sample size re -estimation based on the pooled, blinded SD of the weekly attack rate 
following 50% of subjects completing [ADDRESS_405645] meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this 
study:

 40 1. Males and non-pregna nt, non- lactating females ≥ 18 years of age (main study) or ≥ 12 to 
17 years of age (substudy).  
2. Able to provide written, informed consent. Subjects who are aged [ADDRESS_405646] weight of ≥ 40 kg. 
4. A clinical diagnosis of HAE  Type I or Type II, defined as having a C1-INH functional 
level below 50% and a complement 4 (C4) level below the lower limit of the normal (LLN) reference range, as assessed during the Screening period.  In the absence of a low C4 value drawn during the intercritical period (ie, subject is not 
having an HAE attack), 1 of the following is acceptable to confirm the diagnosis of HAE: 
1) a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene mutation known or likely to be associated with HAE Type I or II 
assessed during the screening period; 2) a confirmed family history of C1- INH 
deficiency; 3)  a C4 redrawn and retested during an attack in the screening period with the 
results below the LLN reference range.  
 
For subjects with C1- INH function ≥  50% but less than the assay LLN, a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]-1 
gene mutation known or likely to be associated with HAE Type I or II, as assessed during 
the screening period OR a repeat C1- INH functional level <  50% will be considered 
acceptable for enrollment.  
 If a subject has a normal C4 at the screening visit and it is desired to utilize a family 
history of C1-INH deficiency to establish an HAE diagnosis for eligibility, the 
Investigato r should document this as a source file note based on either the Investigator’s 
personal knowledge (ie, if a relative of the screening subject is also a patient of the same 
Investigator/practice) or interaction with medical staff of the treatment facility where the 
relative receives HAE care, who confirms the diagnosis. No historical laboratory documentation on the relative should be collected in the source documents.  
If a subject has a normal C4 at the screening visit and has C4 subsequently retested 
during an attack, C4 must be less than the LLN to establish an HAE diagnosis for eligibility. Normal C4 drawn during an attack excludes the subject from study participation.  
For patients with a normal C4 at the screening visit, historical SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_328513]. Mutations known to be associated with HAE or those that are likely associated with HAE (ie an unidentified mutation in the active binding site of C1 -INH) will be accepted.  
5. Access to and ability to use one or mor e acute medications approved by [CONTACT_328535] (icatibant, plasma- derived 
C1-INH, ecallantide, or recombinant C1-INH). Cinryze used for acute treatment of HAE 
attacks is an acceptable medication f or this purpose. 
6. Subjects must be medically appropriate for on- demand treatment as the sole medicinal 
management for their HAE during the study.

Version 4.[ADDRESS_405647] 2 HAE attacks which meet all of the requirements below 
during the run-in period of a maximum of 56 days from the Screening visit: 
• The attacks are unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 
48 hours of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be

Version 4.[ADDRESS_405658] will be permanently discontinued from study drug for any of the following reasons, 
which will be recorded in the source documents and CRF.  
• Emergence of any laboratory abnormality or AE that in the judgment of the 
Investigator compromises the ability  of the subject to continue study- specific 
procedures or it is considered not to be in the subject’s best interest due to an altered 
risk/benefit profile.  
• Recurrence of treatment -emergent AST or ALT elevation > 5 × ULN (confirmed) if 
BCX7353 is restarted a fter meeting hold criteria as outlined in Section  12.2.2. 
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN combined with either laboratory 
abnormalities indicative of significant hepatic toxicity (ie, meeting Hy’s law, total bilirubin > 2 × ULN OR with an international normalized ratio [INR] > 1.5 or with symptomatology of acute hepatitis [ie, severe fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)]). 
• Subsequent determination that inclusion/exclusion criteria were not met

judgment of the Investiga tor, affect assessments of clinical status to a significant 
degree.  
• Subject noncompliance with study drug or to the protocol. 
• The subject has a QTcF  > 500 msec (confirmed on repeat ECG testing). 
• The subject has a QTcF  increase of more than 60  msec (confirmed by [CONTACT_232757]) 
from the mean QTcF value obtained from triplicate ECGs obtained at the Baseline 
visit and a simultaneous absolute QTcF > 450 msec (male s) or > 470 msec (females ).  
• Subjects with a study drug related Grade 3 or 4 rash as described by [CONTACT_71513] (DMID) criteria “Skin -mucocutaneous” will be 
discontinued from study drug and treated according to best medical practice. All 
subjects with a suspected drug rash should undergo specific rash evaluation as 
described in Section  12.2.1. A Grade [ADDRESS_405659] 
and Sponsor deem it appropriate. The protocol for continuing BCX7353 in the 
presence of a rash is described in Section  12.2.1.  
Subjects who discontinue from study drug in Parts  1 or 2 will be requested to complete all 
regularly scheduled visits and procedures outlined in Table 2  or Table 3 , respectively,  through 
the end of the study part (ie, Part  1 or 2) in which they were being treated. Subjects who

9.3.1. Blinding  
This is a double-blind study throughout both Parts 1 and 2. As such, study drug assignment will 
be blinded to the Investigator, study staff, study subjects, and clinical research organization staff.  
Part 3 will be open-label. No blinding will be used. 
During Part 1, Sponsor employee(s) will also be blinded to the treatment allocation of individual 
subjects, with the exception of Sponsor staff responsible for managing clinical supplies. 
Employees who are not blinded to drug assignment will have no access to any other subject- level 
information for the duration of the study. Sponsor employees interacting with sites will remain 
blinded for Part 2 of the study, however, unblinding of these staff may occur out of necessity 
during document preparation for regulatory filings of the study. 
The bioanalytical laboratory performing BCX7353 plasma concentration analysis will be given a 
copy of the randomization scheme.  
Information on unblinding in the event of an SAE is provided in Section 12.1.9. 
9.3.2. Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized via interactive (web or voice) response system (IXRS). Details on 
the processes to be followed for randomization will be provided in a separate manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part 1 Randomization 
Approximately 96 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 (active:active:placebo) ratio to 1 of the 
following treatments in Part 1:  
• Group 1:  BCX7353 110 mg administered orally QD for 24 weeks  
• Group 2:  BCX7353 150 mg administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
• Group 3:  Placebo administered orally QD for 24 weeks 
Randomization will proceed in accordance with a computer- generated randomization schedule 
prepared by a nonstudy statistician. There will be a separate randomization schedule for main study and substudy subjects (adult and adolescent subjects, respectively). 
Sites will randomize eligible subjects in the IXRS, preferably after all baseline assessments to 
reconfirm eligibility have been completed.  
If required by [CONTACT_100412] (ie, dispensing of randomized study drug must occur through a 
pharmacy), the subject may be randomized on the business day prior to the planned baseline visit. The Sponsor may require review of screening data prior to randomizing a subject (eg, concomitant medications); any requirements will be provided to the site separately. 
Enrollment into treatment groups will be stratified by [CONTACT_328545] (≥ 2 attacks/month vs. < 2 attacks/month). The baseline attack rate must be provided during 
randomization and is c alculated by:  
(The number of HAE attacks meeting the criteria of an HAE attack below from the 
Screening visit through the time of randomization × 28) divided by [CONTACT_328551], Inc.  
Version 4.[ADDRESS_405661] meet the following criteria:  
• The attacks must be unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 48 hours of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be 
documented to cause functional impairment based on subject entry in the diary. Functional impairment is defined as the subject being unable to perform their daily activities without restriction (ie, subject records that they are at least slightly restricted in their daily activities during their HAE attack).  
• The attacks must include symptoms of swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling. 
• The attacks must be confirmed by [CONTACT_328536]. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 2 business days of the attack to discuss the attack, any queries on the entered data in the e -diary, as applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part 2 Randomization 
Sites will randomize subjects in the IXRS at the Week 24 visit for Part 2 study drug. Subjects who received active BCX7353 in Part 1 of the study (Treatment Groups 1 and 2) will continue to 
receive the same dosing regimen in Part 2. Randomization for subjects randomized to placebo in 
Part 1 (Treatment Group 3) will proceed in accordance with a computer -generated randomization 
schedule prepared by a nonstudy statistician. These subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive a 110 or 150 mg dose (see  Figure 2 ). Sites will assign drug/randomize subjects in the 
IXRS at the Week 24 visit for Part 2 study drug. Sites using a centralized pharmacy may 
assign/drug randomize the subject the day prior to the Week 24 visit.

o Part 3: one 150 mg capsule of BCX7353 QD × up to 96 weeks  
• Treatment Group 3a: 
o Parts 1 and 2 (placebo in Part 1, 110 mg in Part 2): two capsules of placebo QD × 24 weeks (Days 1 to 168) followed by [CONTACT_1192] 55 mg capsules of BCX7353 QD × 24 weeks (Days 169 to 337) 
o Part 3: one [ADDRESS_405664] can be transitioned to the 150 mg dose. 
• Treatment Group 3b:  
o Parts 1 and 2 (placebo in Part 1, 150 mg in Part 2): two capsules of placebo QD × 24 weeks (Days 1 to 168) followed by [CONTACT_1192] 75 mg capsules of BCX7353 QD × 24 weeks (Days 169 to 337) 
o Part 3: one 150 mg capsule of BCX7353 QD × up to [ADDRESS_405665] whether the drug is being taken as instructed (ie, with a meal). 
Day [ADDRESS_405666] dose (Day 1), rather than the day of the 
baseline visit. Clinic administration of study drug during study visits is not required. Subjects will take study drug in Part 1 beginning on Day  1 and will complete Part 1 dosing on Study 
Day 168 ( the day before the Week 24 visit). Subjects will take Part [ADDRESS_405667] time, the dose may be 
taken later in the day; however, no more than [ADDRESS_405668] in their diary the time of day study drug was taken, and the 
number of capsules of study drug taken.  
With the exception of the Week 2 and 26 visits, subjects will be instructed to bring all drug kits 
(including both unused and used bottles) and diaries with them for each study visit. 
Accountability and adherence will be reviewed at these visits.  
During the conduct of the study, responsibility for kit supply and resupply may be transferred to 
a specialty pharmacy selected by [CONTACT_1052] s ubjects may receive study drug directly from 
the specialty pharmacy.  Detailed instructions will be provided a t the time of implementation.  
If a specialty pharmacy is used, specialty pharmacy staff may contact [CONTACT_328552]’s participation in the study. 
9.5. Study Drug Dose Modification  
Dose reductions are not permitted.  Study drug interruptions are discussed in Section 12.1.8. 
Based on the results of the current study’s Part 1 analysis of greater efficacy and no increase in 
safety or tolerability risk at the 150 mg dose vs. the 110 mg dose, all subjects will be transitioned 
to the 150 mg dose of BCX7353 on or after their Week 48 visit, regardless of their initial or Week 24 treatment allocation , or, for those initially on 110 mg, their satisfaction with this dose 
level . 
9.6. Study Drug (Investigational Medicinal Product ) Accountability  
Accountability of study drug dispensed and returned (as applicable) will be performed at Day [ADDRESS_405669] Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The Investigator/pharmacist must maintain accurate records of the disposition of all study drugs received from the Sponsor, issued to the subject (including date), and any drug accidentally 
destroyed. At the end of the study, information describing study drug supplies (eg, kit numbers) 
and disposition of supplies for each subject must be provided, signed by [CONTACT_18370], and collected by [CONTACT_2689]. If any errors or irregularities in any shipment of study 
medication to the site are discovered at any time, the Sponsor (and or designee) must be 
contact[CONTACT_194873].  
At the end of the study or at other times as agreed by [CONTACT_281960], all study drug not 
dispensed or administered will either be collected under the supervision of the CRA and returned 
to the Sponsor or destroyed on site as dictated by [CONTACT_328554].  
9.7. Concomitant Medications  
All subjects in the study must refrain from taking prohibited concomitant medications as outlined in Section  9.7.1. 
Any regularly administered concomitant medication not listed as prohibited must be anticipated to be continued through the study and be of a stable dose and regimen up to Week 96.  
Details of all prior medications (taken within 30  days of screening; prior contraceptive 
medications taken within 60 days of screening) and all current concomitant medication use 
(including herbal supplements) through the follow-up/e arly t ermination visit,  including all 
medications administered for the treatment of AEs, will be recorded in the source 
documentation/CRFs.  
9.7.1. Prohibited Medications  
C1-INH for prophylaxis of HAE attacks is prohibited within the 14 days prior to the Screening 
visit or initiation d uring the study. However, use of a C1- INH therapy for treatment of attacks is 
not excluded at any time, nor is C1-INH for unplanned/unanticipated preprocedure prophylaxis.

10. STUDY CONDUCT  
10.1. Over view  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A subject’s participation in this 
study is expected to be up to 157 weeks (inclusive of the screening and follow-up periods), or 
until another mechanism is available to provide drug to the subject,  or until the Sponsor 
discontinues development of the product for the prevention of angioedema attacks, whichever comes first.  
Each eligible subject who consents to participate in the study will receive either 24 weeks (168 days) of BCX7353 (110 or 150 mg) or placebo in Part 1. Based on the results of the current 
study’s Part 1 analysis of greater efficacy and no increase in safety  or tolerability  risk at the 
150 mg dose vs. the 110 mg dose, all subjects will be transitioned to the 150 mg dose of 
BCX7353 on or after their Week 48 visit, regardless of their initial or Week 24 treatment 
allocation. All subjects will undergo a screening period (including a prospective HAE attack run-
in period between 14 and 56 days) of up to [ADDRESS_405672] 28 visits: Day  1 
(Baseline), Week 2 (Day 15; liver enzymes only), Week 4 (Day 29), Week 8 (Day 57), Week 12 (Day  85), Week 18 (Day 127), Week 24 (Day 169), Week 26 (Day 183, liver enzymes only), 
Week 28 (Day 197), Week 32 (Day 225), Week 36 (Day 253), Week 48 (Day 337), Week 60 
(Day 421), Week 72 (Day 505), Week 84 (Day 589), Week 96 (Day 673), Week 108 (Day 757), 
Week 120 (Day 841), Week 132 (Day 925), and Week 144 (Day 1009). A follow-up visit off of study drug will also be scheduled during Week 147.

during the screening period or a repeat C1- INH functional level <  50% will be considered acceptable for enrollment.  
n The subject will be determined as eligible for the study based upon screening evaluations and the prospective recording of HAE attacks during the run -in 
period. The subject must have at least 2  HAE attacks during the run -in period which meet all of the following requirements: 1) the attacks must oc cur during 
the run -in period (period between Screening and Baseline; minimum of 14 days and maximum of 56 days); 2) the attacks are unique, which is defined as an

62 10.3. Study Visits 
10.3.1. Screening Visit  
Written informed consent and assent (as applicable) must be obtained from each subject before 
initiation of any screening assessments or procedures. Each subject will receive a copy of the 
signed and dated study-specific informed consent form (ICF). Prospective subjects who have signed an ICF who are interested in participation in the study will then undergo assessments at a 
screening visit to determine eligibility. Signing of the ICF may occur prior to the screening visit, 
which is defined as the visit where site-conducted screening procedures, including e-diary dispensing, are performed.  
The Investigator (or designee) will conduct the following assessments at the screening visit, 
including: 
• Signing of informed consent form (if not done prior to the visit) and assent (as applicable)  
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Medical and medication history (including HAE medical and medication history) 
• Complete physical examination  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Height/weight/body mass index (BMI) estimation  
• Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) 
• Serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child -bearing potential 
• Blood collection for clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, HBV/HIV/HCV serology, C1- INH function , C4 level, and FSH (for women who declare that they 
have been post- menopausal ≤  2 years). Blood may also be drawn for possible 
SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene analysis (see Section 11.2.10)  
• Urine collection for urinalysis, drugs of abuse screen and possible reflex testing for abnormal gamma -glutamyltranspeptidase ( GGT ), AST, or ALT 
• Recording of AEs and concomitant medications  
• HAE attack e-diary provision and instruc tion 
All subjects will receive an e -diary at the screening visit to establish eligibility during the run -in 
period (ie, a minimum of 14 days to a maximum of 56 days from the date of the screening visit) 
and also to provide a baseline attack rate to properly stratify the subject during Part [ADDRESS_405691] of the screening visit, a site is permitted to perform screening assessments over more than one screening visit; however, the e- diary should be 
dispensed on the first screening visit day, initiating the run-in period. 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405692] reports a dose of C1- INH 
has been taken  for an attack within approximately 3 days of the planned visit as C1- INH 
functional level is more likely to come back normal or to not meet Inclusion Criterion #4. 
10.3.2. Period Between Screening and Baseline  
Procedures to be performed by [CONTACT_5753]/or clinica l trial participants between screening and 
baseline are outlined in Table [ADDRESS_405693]’s eligibility based upon the number of HAE attacks will be determined during the 
run-in period; the baseline attack rate of the subject will also be calculated during the period 
from the Screening visit through randomization for the purposes of properly stratifying the subject during randomization.  
For all attacks that occur following the s creening visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_328558] [ADDRESS_405694] summary, and Investigator verification of the attack will be documented in the source records; the Investigator attack verification (confirmed or rejected) will also be recorded. 
 
In order for the subject to qualify for the study, t he subject must have at least 2  HAE attacks 
during the run-in period which meet all of the following requirements below: 
• The attacks are unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 
48 hours of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be 
documented to cause functional impairment based on subject entry in the diary. Functional impairment is defined as the subject being unable to perform their daily activities without restriction (ie, subject records that they are at least slightly restricted in their daily activities during their HAE attack).  
• The attacks must include symptoms of swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling. 
• The at tacks are otherwise confirmed by [CONTACT_328536].  
Once a subject records  2 such attacks, they may be randomized to study drug beginning on or 
after Day 28 of the run-in period; subjects having at least [ADDRESS_405695] P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
64 The Investigator (or designee) must call and talk to the subject at least weekly in between the 
screening and baseline visits; alternative forms of interactive communication such as returned 
email and cellular text correspondence are acceptable. During all  calls, the Investigator (or 
designee) will assess the subject’s overall wellbeing, discuss compliance (if applicable), proper recording of attack details (if applicable), or any usability issues with the e-diary. A weekly 
phone call may be omitted if the subject records an attack as the Investigator must call and confirm or reject the attack.  
If a subject has a normal C4 level (as is the case in a small percentage of subjects with HAE) 
drawn at the screening visit, the site may take another sample for C4 level assessment, during an attack. A normal C4 level, when drawn during an attack, excludes the subject from study participation.  
If a subject has a normal C4 at the s creening visit and it is desired to utilize a family history of 
C1-INH deficiency to est ablish an HAE diagnosis for eligibility, the Investigator should 
document this as a source file note based on either the Investigator’s personal knowledge (ie, if a 
relative of the screening subject is also a patient of the same Investigator/practice) or interaction 
with medical staff of the treatment facility where the relative receives HAE care, who confirms the diagnosis. No historical laboratory documentation on the relative should be collected in the source documents.  
A SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]-1 mutation known, or likely, to be associated with HAE Type I or II  is acceptable 
to confirm the diagnosis of HAE. For a C1 -INH functional level that is between 50% and the LLN (74%), the site may draw 
another C1-INH functional level or, if desired, have a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]- 1 gene mutatio nal analysis 
performed by [CONTACT_2237]. A C1-INH functional level < 50% or a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]-1 
mutation known, or likely, to be associated with HAE Type I or II , as assessed by [CONTACT_11378], is acceptable to confirm the diagnosis of HAE. 
Blood for possible SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]-1 gene sequencing may be drawn at the Screening visit but 
analyzed in the period between the s creening and baseline visits only if required for eligibility 
(normal C4 at screening or a C1-INH level between 50% and the LLN [74%]). 
Subje cts who are deemed ineligible for the study will return their e -diary to the study site. 
Rescreening of ineligible subjects, where there is a reasonable expectation that the subject will 
become eligible, will be approved or denied on a case-by- case basis b y the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor. Retesting of specific assessments within the screening period without entirely 
rescreening a subject may be permitted. Additionally, the Investigator must gain Sponsor 
approval to enroll subjects who are not randomized within 10 weeks of the screening visit; this may require screening labs to be redrawn. Subjects will not be permitted to rescreen if they did not meet the HAE attack requirements during the run-in period. 
A screening failure CRF page will be completed for those subjects who do not proceed with 
study dosing, recording the reason for screen failure. 
AEs and concomitant medications will be recorded if reported during this period.

11. ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of procedures and assessments to be conducted throughout the study are outlined in Table 2  ,Table 3 , and Table  4 (for Parts  1, 2, and 3, respectively) with details on the conduct of 
the procedures/ assessments provided below.  
11.1. Chronology of Assessments  
The following chronology of events should be adhered to during the scheduled visits, as applicable:  
• QoL/health outcome questionnaires: obtain prior to all clinic procedures 
• ECGs: obtain prior to vital signs and blood specimen collection 
• Vital signs: obtain prior to blood specimen collection 
• Randomization and study drug dispensing/dosing: end of the visit 
11.2. Investigator -Completed Assessments 
Demographic information, including year of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be captured for each subject participating in the study at the screening visit. Medical and medication history will be captured at the screening visit and updated at baseline. Subject participation in a prior BCX7353 study will be captured (eg, study, previous subject number).  
Contraceptive methods enabling eligibility will be captured in source documentation at the 
screening visit. Contraceptive methods and/or lifestyle should be reviewed throughout the study to ensure they remain appropriate for the subject.  
11.2.1. HAE Medical and Medication History  
An HAE medical history questionnaire provided by [CONTACT_281966]. 
All questions should be completed by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) from historical source 
documentation when available, with subject input as necessary to complete the remaining 
questions. The completed HAE Medical History Questionnaire will be considered a source document and must be entered in the CRF in full to enable randomization (see Section 9.3.2).  
11.2.2. Physical Examination 
A full physical examination will be conducted at Screening, Baseline, and at Week 24. All other physical examinations will be abbreviated (ie, targeted or symptom-directed) to include, at a minimum, evaluation of any new signs or symptoms.  
Genitourinary and breast examinations may be omitted when not required by [CONTACT_281967].

Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
72 11.2.3. Weight/Body Mass Index 
For determination of height and weight, subjects should be clothed with shoes removed.  
BMI should be calculated using the following formula: 
BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)[ADDRESS_405712] bedside or routine 12- lead ECG machine that calculates heart rate and measures the 
PR, QRS, QT, RR, and QTc (QTcF) intervals will be utilized. Prior to obtaining an ECG, subjects should rest quietly in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 10 minutes. 
Qualified site personnel should review the ECGs and automated findings in real- time for gross 
abnormalities and interval measurements of concern (absolute readings and for postbaseline 
ECGs, a change from baseline). For all ECGs, the clinical interpretation of the ECG and 
calculated QTcF (including adjudication of any automated measurements or diagnoses) should be recorded directly on a hard copy of the ECGs. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_281910]. All subject identifiers will be masked prior to provision to the Sponsor. 
Baseline (predose) and Week 24 ECGs will be obtained in triplicate (ie, 3 separate readings 
taken at 1 - to 5- minute intervals) with baseline values calculated from an average of the 
3 readings. All other ECGs will be single assessments.  
An ECG should be repeated for a change from baseline in QTcF > 60 msec or a QTcF interval 
> 500 msec.  
11.2.5. Vital Signs  
Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate should be taken after the subject has rested in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_405713]’s arm supported at the level of the heart. It is 
acceptable to obtain a pulse rate from the blood pressure or ECG machine. Temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_328518], Baseline, and Week [ADDRESS_405714] fasting

only. Relationships between safety assessment findings and HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_328520] a meta-study basis 
11.2.9. Pregnancy Testing  
FSH will be measured at screening in women declaring themselves pos tmenopausal ≤  [ADDRESS_405716] postmenopausal ≤  [ADDRESS_405717] in source documents. 
11.2.10. HAE Diagnostic Confirmation 
C1-INH functional level and C4 are to be drawn  at the screening visit; it is recommended that 
samples not be drawn within 3 days of C1- INH administration ( eg, use for treatment of an HAE 
attack).  
If a subject has a normal C4 level (as is the case in a small percentage of subjects with HAE) 
drawn at t he screening visit, the site may draw another C4 level during an attack. A normal C4 
level drawn during an attack excludes the subject from study participation. 
Alternatively, the site may also utilize SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene mutational analysis or a family history 
of C1 -INH deficiency in the case of a normal C4 level. To utilize a family history of C1- INH 
deficiency to establish an HAE diagnosis for eligibility, the Investigator should document this as 
a source file note based on either the Investigator’s personal knowledge (ie, if a relative of the 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405718] is also a patient of the same Investigator/practice) or interaction with medical 
staff of the treatment facility where the relative receives HAE care, who confirms the diagnosis. 
No historical laboratory documentation on the relative should be collected in the source documents. A SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]-1 mutation known or likely to be associated with HAE Type I or II  
assessed during the screening period is acceptable to confirm the diagnosis of HAE. 
For subjects with a normal C4 at the screening visit, historical SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_328521] . 
For a C1 -INH functional level that is between 50% and the LLN (74%), the site may draw 
another C1-INH functional level sample or, if desired, have SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene mutational 
analysis performed. A C1- INH functional level <  50% or a SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 mutation known or 
likely to be associated with HAE Type 1 or 2 is acceptable to confirm the diagnosis of HAE. 
Blood for possible SERPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] -1 gene sequencing may be drawn at the Screening visit or during 
the period between screening and baseline but analyzed only if required (normal C4 at screening 
or a C1 -INH functional level between 50% and the LLN [74%]). 
11.2.11. Other Laboratory Assessment s 
Troponin I, Troponin T, NGAL, and CK- MB will be measured in this study at Baseline, at 
on-treatment visits (except for Weeks 2 and 26) and at follow-up.  
C3 level will be taken at Baseline and subsequently only if required for study drug- related rash 
(see Section 11.2.14)  
A C1 -INH antigenic level will be measured at Baseline.  
11.2.12. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
All plasma samples for determination of BCX7353 will be analyzed using a validated liquid 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy assay. The analysis of PK samples obtained from subjects randomized to placebo will be limited. The bioanalytical lab performing the analysis may be 
given the randomization scheme prior to unblinding to avoid analysis of subjects who received 
placebo.  
Blood samples for PK and kallikrein inhibition will be drawn on all subjects at baseline and subsequent visits through Week 48 (except Weeks 2 and 26).  
Actual date and ti me of sample collection will be recorded in the CRF. Sites will ensure that the 
time of the previous dose prior to the blood draw is recorded in the diary (may also be captured 
in the CRF). 
Instructions for collection, processing, storage, and shipment of PK samples will be provided to 
the clinical site in a separate document.  
11.2.13. Pharmacogenomic Testing  
All subjects who are willing to participate and sign a separate informed consent will have a blood sample drawn at Baseline (or any other time poin t on study if not obtained at Baseline) for 
possible exploratory pharmacogenomics testing. Testing may be undertaken in one or more 
locus/loci if desired by [CONTACT_328565] P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405719]’s name [CONTACT_328584]. Subjects may 
withdraw their consent for participation in the optional pharmacogenomic portion of the study 
after the sample has been collected by [CONTACT_328566]. If the sample has not yet been analyzed, it will be destroyed. If the s ample has been analyzed, the information that has been 
collected will be retained.  
Pharmacogenomic samples will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_405720] inform the Sponsor medical monitor via the EOSI form of all BCX7353 -related maculopapular rashes 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). If the rash is assessed as not maculopapular (eg, urticarial) or not related to 
BCX7353 (ie, has a clear alternative etiology), then the rash should be reported as an AE not an EOSI, treated per Investigator judgement, and no further special assessment is required. 
The following assessments must be completed for all subjects with a  diffuse maculopapular rash 
assessed as related to BCX7353  as soon as logistically possible:  
• Full dermato logical exam to include the scope of the rash (location), vital signs, and 
mucosal examination. The notes documenting the examination should include 
detailed description of the rash; presence or absence of desquamation; presence or 
absence of blistering and if present, its extent; presence or absence of mucosal involvement and if present, its extent; and any other associated abnormal physical findings.  
• High resolution photographs taken to provide both detail regarding the rash and details regarding the extent of the rash. Cameras must be able to provide clear images taken in close proximity to the skin. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_328522] a ruler (centimeter) for scale. Every attempt to protect subject anonymity should be made. 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
78 • All detailed clinical information rega rding the rash, examination, treatment and 
interpretation of the event needs to be reported on an SAE/ EOSI  report form as per 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• Blood taken for clinical chemistry, hematology including differential, and C3 level. 
Table 5  outlines the clinical chemistry and hematology analytes to be assessed. If the 
Investigator wishes more rapid results, a second set of blood tubes may be sent to the 
local lab for faster processing.  
• Vital signs including temperature 
• Urine sent to local laboratory for urine eosinophils (if evaluation is available locally).  
• Subjects should be requested to undergo a standard dermatologic punch biopsy for H&E staining and immunofixation. The biopsy should be of fresh lesion both for diagnostic and scientific purposes, after obtaining specific informed consent. This 
type of biopsy requires only antisepsis and local anesthesia, without the need for 
sutures. The  biopsy results will significantly help to clarify the underlying 
pathophysiology of the rash and more fully inform the risk/benefit assessment and 
ultimate therapeutic course. If the study site cannot perform a biopsy or any of the 
above mandatory assessments (ie, photographs), then subjects should be referr ed to a 
physician who can perform the assessments/biopsy (ie, a dermatologist). If a 
non-study physician performs any of the assessments or biopsy, a full written 
consultation report should be obtained expeditiously and include clinical examination findings and clinical diagnostic assessment. Biopsies should be at least 3 mm 
minimum diameter. Instructions for preparation of the samples and details regarding 
histopathological assessment will be according to local practice. Note: If the rash is no longer present by [CONTACT_328567], biopsy is not required.  
If a subject with drug- related treatment -emergent maculopapular rash does not agree 
to undergo skin punch biopsy, study drug dosing may be continued, but with weekly 
visits until the rash has resolved.   
• Subjects will also be required to donate a blood sample for peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for analysis of possible drug- specific immune responses 
and possible drug-responsive T-cells. This sample should be obtained preferably 1 to 
3 months but as late as 5 years after occurrence of the rash. Information on PBMC 
collection, processing, and shipment will be c ommunicated to sites prior to sample 
collection. All additional detailed clinical information regarding the rash, 
examination, treatment and interpretation of the event needs to be reported on the SAE/EOSI  report form as per Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
11.2.15. Adverse Events  
AEs will be assessed and recorded from the time that the ICF is signed through the last follow-up visit or until the AE is resolved or the subjec t is in a clinically stable condition with regards to 
the AE. Full details on recording and reporting AEs are provided in Section 12.1.2.

79 11.3. Patient -Reported Outcomes  
The AE -QoL, TSQM, and WPAI will each be administered once at Baseline (predose) and at 
Weeks  4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96. After Week 96, the TSQM and WPAI  
will be administered every 24 weeks (Weeks 120 and 144). 
The EQ -5D-5L will be administered once at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 28, 32, 36, 
48, 60, 72, 84, and 96. After Week 96, the EQ -5D-5L will be administered every 24 weeks 
(Weeks 120  and 144). Subjects will fill out this questionnaire as instructed, describing their 
current health state today. During the on- treatment visits (post- baseline), subjects will fill out a 
second EQ- 5D-5L questionnaire if they have had an attack since the previous visit. The subject 
will be instructed to fill out this second questionnaire based on a recollection of their health state 
during an average attack that they experienced since the previous visit. 
Subjects will also be queried about their long- term experienc e on study beginning at Week [ADDRESS_405721] perceptions. 
11.4. HAE Attack and Dosing Diary and Attack Confirmation  
11.4.1. Screening and Parts 1 and 2 
[IP_ADDRESS]. HAE Attack and Dosing Diary 
The Sponsor will supply e- diaries to sites. Study -specific manuals will be prepared for both site 
staff and subjects for use of the e-diary for this study. 
While a subject has an e- diary in their possession, the subject will fill out the HAE attack e -diary  
daily , recalling whether or not symptoms of an HAE attack were experienced in the previous

e-diary including start and stop time of the attack, attack symptoms, anatomical location of 
swelling (if applicable), severity, treatment(s) administered and times of administration, and whether additional medical care was sought for the attack. During study drug administration, subjects will also record the times of day study drug was taken daily in the e- diary .   
All subjects will fill out an HAE e -diary during the run-in period of a minimum of [ADDRESS_405723] is initially provided an e-diary at the Screening 
visit and then as needed during the study (eg, to turn off entry into the dosing diary when not 
receiving study drug). Subjects should be instructed to bring their e-diary with them to each 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405724] completes or 
discontinues the study, the site should ensure that e- diaries are returned.  
Given that real -time acces s to e- diary entries for subjects is available via website access, the 
Investigator (or designee) will proactively assess compliance, beginning during the screening 
period. Further training on completing the e-diary should be provided if e- diary completion  
compliance is < 90% at any point that during the study. A phone call may be necessary if 
compliance issues are noted in between clinic visits. Scheduled phone calls during the screening 
period and through Part [ADDRESS_405725]’s overall 
wellbeing, discuss compliance (if applicable), proper recording of attack details (if applicable), 
or any usability issues with the e-diary. 
Study staff are not permitted to make any entries into the diary.  
In the event that a subject’s e-diary becomes nonfunctional or is otherwise not available for data 
recording, a paper diary may be utilized for short-term HAE attack and dose recording until the 
subject receives a replacement e-diary. Other scenarios for which the use of the paper diary 
and/or the shipment of a replacement e-diary may be permitted, following consultation with the Sponsor. During the period of paper diary use, it will be necessary for the subject to contact [CONTACT_328568].  
Subjects  who discontinue study drug should continue to record the occurrence of HAE attacks in 
their diary until the follow -up visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator Confirmation of Attacks 
Sites will have real -time access to e- diary entries for their subjects, including all attack details 
recorded, and will receive a notification for each attack that is recorded.   
For all attacks that occur from screening through the end of Part 2, the Investigator (or 
appropriately trained designee) will review the e- diary record of the attack det ails. Subjects will 
then be contact[CONTACT_328556] [ADDRESS_405726] summary, and Investigator verification or rejection of the attack will be documented in the source records; the Investigator attack verification (confirmed or rejected) will also be recorded.  
During the run- in period, HAE attacks used to establish eligibility must meet the following 
stipulations, in addition to the Investigator confirmation: 
• The attacks must occur during the run-in period which is a minimum of [ADDRESS_405727] 2 eligible attacks may be randomized to 
study drug beginning on or after Day 28 of the run-in period; subjects having at least [ADDRESS_405728] P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
81 • The attacks are unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 
48 hours of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be 
documented to cause functional impairment based on subject entry in the diary. 
Functional impairment is defined as the subject being unable to perform their daily 
activities without restriction (ie, subject records that they are at least slightly restricted in their daily activities during their HAE attack).  
• The attacks must include symptoms of swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling.  
During the remainder of the screening period (after eligibility has been established during the 
run-in period but prior to randomization), HAE attacks must meet the following stipulations to 
be counted in the baseline attack rate calculation necessary for stratification, in addition to the Investigator confirmation: 
• The attacks are unique, which is defined as an attack that does not begin within 
48 hours of the end of a previous attack. 
• The attacks must have either been treated, required medical attention or be 
documented to cause functional impairment based on subject entry in the diary. 
Functional impairment is defined as the subject being unable to perform their daily 
activities without restriction (ie, subject records that they are at least slightly restricted in their daily activities during their HAE attack).  
• The attacks must include symptoms of swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling.  
After randomization through the end of Part 2, Investigators will use their judgment to confirm or reject a reported event as an HAE attack; however, all attacks must include symptoms of 
swelling. Symptoms of swelling, in addition to visible swelling, may also include symptoms in 
the oropharyngeal or abdominal regions which are indicative of internal swelling. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Scheduled Telephone Contact  
[CONTACT_116297] (or designee) must call and talk to the subject at least weekly in betw een the 
Screening and Baseline visits and on-treatment through Week 24 and once during Weeks 40 and 
44. Alternative forms of interactive communication such as returned email and cellular text 
correspondence are acceptable. During all calls, the Investigator (or designee) will assess the 
subject’s overall wellbeing, discuss compliance (if applicable), proper recording of attack details (if applicable), or any usability issues with the e-diary. The phone call may be omitted if the subject records an attack as  the Investigator must call and confirm or reject the attack.  
11.4.2. Part 3  
[IP_ADDRESS]. HAE Attack Diary  
The Sponsor will supply diaries to sites.  
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405729] does report an attack, additional details about the attack will be entered into the diary 
including start and stop time of the attack, attack symptoms, anatomical location of swelling (if 
applicable), severity, treatment(s) administered and times of administration, and whether 
additional medical care was sought for the attack  (through Week 96 only) .  
Subjects should be instructed to bring their diary with them to each study visit, up to and including Week 144. Once a subject completes or discontinues the study, the site should ensure that diaries are collected .  
Study staff are not permitted to make any entries into the diary and are not permitted to change entries.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug should continue to record the occurrence of HAE attacks in their diary until the follow -up visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Scheduled Telephone Contact  
[CONTACT_116297] (or designee) must call and talk to the subject once during Weeks 52, 56, 64, 68, 76, 80, 88, and 92. Alternative forms of interactive communication such as returned email and 
cellular text correspondence are acceptable. During all calls, the Investigator (or des ignee) will 
assess the subject’s overall wellbeing and proper recording of attack details (if applicable). 
12. ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING  
12.1. Adverse Events  
AEs will be assessed and recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent through the 
appropriate follow -up period.  
12.1.1. Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject. No causal relationship with the study drug or with the clinical study itself is implied. An AE may be an unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the clinical 
study. Clinically relevant abnormal results of diagnostic procedures including abnormal 
laboratory findings (eg, requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or trea tment measures, or 
resulting in withdrawal from the study) are considered to be AEs. If the diagnostic procedure prompts no additional treatment, visits, or monitoring, it may not meet the definition of an AE. 
This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol- specified 
AE reporting period (see Section 12.1.2), including medical triggers resulting in an 
HAE attack. Emotional stress will not be considered an AE unless it results in a medical diagnosis or requires medical treatment.  
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
83 • Findings from protocol-mandated interventions. This can include laboratory 
assessments performed in the course of the clinical trial. AEs should only be reported if the abnormalities are changes from baseline and are clinically significant as described above.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_328569]-specified AE reporting period. When recording such events on an 
AE/SAE eCRF page, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting 
condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (eg, “more frequent headaches”).  
An adverse reaction is defined in Article 2(n) of Directive 2001/20/EC as follows: all untoward and unintended responses to a study drug/IMP related to any dose administered. The definition covers also  medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse 
and abuse of the product. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug/IMP. This means that there are fa cts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
For the purposes of this protocol, HAE attacks and their associated symptoms will not be defined 
as AEs, even if the  subject requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This information, as well as HAE attacks an d 
associated symptoms are reported  in the subject’s diary and are  a reflection of the disease under 
study. The events that may trigger an HAE attack , such as an infection or trauma, are considered 
AEs and should be reported as such. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328523]. These scenarios include a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281914]: 
• Perform a routine control screening for a preexisting illness or to diagnose a suspected 
illness . In the case of the latter, the symptomatology should be reported as an AE and 
amended if a diagnosis is confirmed. 
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a preexisting medical condition that has not changed (eg, a joint replacement for w hich the subject was on a waiting list).  
• Undergo medical observation due to HAE (eg, admission after routine dental procedure in a subject with HAE).  
• Undergo medical observation without the occurrence of an AE due to standard of care in the region or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Surgical procedures should not be reported as AEs. The condition for which the surgery is required should be reported as the AE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned 
surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_113124](s) leading to these 
measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment. In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history. 
AEs are designated as “nonserious” or “serious.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is an adverse event/reaction that results in any of the following outcomes: 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
84 • Death  
• Is life -threatening (subject is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have ca used death if it were more 
severe)  
• Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (formal admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979]) 
or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328524]).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie, there is a substantial disruption of a person's ability to carry out normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject’s heal th or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. For this study, examples of such events may include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
In addition, the sponsor considers events of abortion (spontaneous or induced), fetal demise, and 
still birth as SAEs for reporting purposes. 
Some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281915], as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. do not require reporting as SAEs. 
Overdose will be considered an SAE only if any of the seriousness criteria are met. Any clinical 
complication in association with the overdose should be reported as an AE or SAE (as 
applicable) along with the overdose (see Section 12.2.3) . Details of signs or symptoms, clinical 
management and outcome should be reported, if available. Overdose without associated signs or 
symptoms should not be recorded as AEs but should be recorded as protocol deviations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For this protocol, nonserious treatment- emergent maculopapular rashes that are deemed related 
to BCX7353 will be considered EOSIs . This does not include other types of rashes such as 
urticaria or eczema. All treatment -emergent skin conditions should be reported as AEs but only 
maculopapular rashes deemed related to BCX7353 should be considered EOSIs.  
An EOSI event in and of itself will not be considered serious unles s it meets the  seriousness 
criteria above. Events of maculopapular rash assessed as possibly, probably, or definitely related 
to BCX7353 regardless of severity must be reported to the Sponsor Medical Monitor as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. Management of BCX7353 drug- related rash is provided in 
Section  12.2.1. 
12.1.2. Method, Frequency, and Time Period for Detecting Adverse Events and 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Reports of all AEs and SAEs, regardless of Investigator attribution, are to be collected from the 
time of signing of the informed consent through to the last study visit (ie, through the posttreatment follow -up visit). All AEs and SAEs are to be reported on the AE CRF.  
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405730] follow-up visit, Grade 1 and 
2 events do not need to be followed if the event is deemed unlikely to be related or not related to study drug (see Section 12.1.3 for AE grading). For all Grade [ADDRESS_405731] is in a clinically stable co ndition with regards to the AE. 
The Investigator shall report all SAEs immediately to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_328570] (phone or email) and by [CONTACT_281974], and 
entering the event onto the AE CRF within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event (see Section  12.1.5) . The SAE report form is a detailed, written report on the SAE provided by [CONTACT_12066]. The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs observed during the study until they are resolved, or are judged medically stable, or are otherwise medically explained. 
The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis based on the presenting 
signs and symptoms. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual sign/symptom. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must 
be recorded individually. Once a diagnosis is made during evaluation or treatment, the 
Investigator will update the AE record with this diagnosis. The immediate and follow-up reports shall identify subjects by [CONTACT_328571]-risk profile of the study 
drug in a clinical trial.  
12.1.3. Definition of Severity  
All AEs will be assessed (graded) for severity and classified using the DMID criteria for grading AEs (Publish date November 2007, see Section 16.1) . Any AEs not covered by [CONTACT_281976] 1  of 4 clearly defined categories as follows:  
Mild:  (Grade 1): Transient or mild symptoms; no limitation in activity; no intervention required. The AE does not interfere with the participant’s normal 
functioning level. It may be an annoyance. 
Moderate:  (Grade 2): Symptom results in mild to moderate limita tion in activity; no or 
minimal intervention required. The AE produces some impairment of functioning, but it is not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
Severe:  (Grade 3): Symptom results in significant limitation in activity; medical intervention may be required. The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Life-
threatening:  (Grade 4): Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy  required to prevent death, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328525]. 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
86 Severity refers to the medical perspective of an event while seriousness reflects the outcome of 
the event (ie, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Events of mild severity can lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328526] a headache may not meet seriousness criteria.  
12.1.4. Definition of Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator or medically qualified designee must review each AE and make the determination of relationship to study drug using the following guidelines: 
Not Related:  The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no temporal relationship exists between the study drug and the event. 
Unlikely:  The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration and is readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_243079]. 
Possibly Related:  There is some temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the study drug and the event is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident. 
Probably Related:  The event follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from drug administration, 
abates upon discontinuation of the drug, and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.  
Definitely Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the study 
drug, is confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_35648] 
(dechallenge), and reappears upon repeated exposure (rechallenge, if rechallenge is medically appropriate).  
12.1.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions  
Any SAE must be reported by [CONTACT_281977] 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the SAE. In addition, all SAEs must be recorded on the AE CRF in real time. All additional follow -up 
evaluations of the SAE must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon as they are available. The SAE report forms should be sent to the following email addresses:  
Phone (24 hours): [PHONE_6862] -859-7905  
Email: [EMAIL_6411] 
[EMAIL_5496]  
 
Immediate reporting should allow BioCryst to take the appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. Therefore, the initial report sh ould be submitted by [CONTACT_46698] a very short period of time and under no circumstances should this period exceed [ADDRESS_405732] to determine whether the SAE requires a 
reassessment of the benefit- risk profile of the study drug in a clinical trial, if the relevant 
information was not already available and provided in the initial report. 
US-based Investigators or designees at each site are responsible for submitting any 
investigational new drug safety report (initial and follow-up) (ie, suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]) or  other safety information (eg, revised IB) to the institutional 
review board (IRB) and for retaining a copy in their files, unless otherwise instructed. 
European-based Investigators or designees at each site are responsible for retaining copi[INVESTIGATOR_281917] (initial and follow -up) and other safety information (eg, revised IB) in their files. 
BioCryst or its designee will subm it all S[LOCATION_003]R reports (initial and follow -up) or other safety 
information (eg, revised IB) to the required authorities. 
BioCryst shall ensure that all relevant information about S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or 
life-threatening is recorded and reported as soon as possible to the competent authorities in all 
participating countries, including European Member States concerned and the US, and to the independent ethics committees (IECs), and in any case no later than [ADDRESS_405733] or designee shall also inform all Investigators. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Events of Special Interest  
All events of diffuse maculopapular rash assessed as related to study drug/IMP, regardless of 
severity must be reported by [CONTACT_328572]/EOSI  report form within 24 hours of the Investigator’s assessment of the 
event. High resolution photographs must also be submitt ed as described in Section  11.2.14. In 
addition, the event must be recorded on the AE CRF in real time. All additional follow-up evaluations of the event must be reported to BioCryst or its designee as soon as they are 
available. The SAE/ EOSI  report form should be sent to the following email addresses:  
Phone (24 hours): +1 -[PHONE_6860] 
Email: [EMAIL_6411];  
[EMAIL_5496] 
 
This method of reporting will allow BioCryst to obtain more information than can be captured in the eCRF for this event. The report form will allow a full clinical description and information regarding the evaluation that cannot be documented in the electronic data capture due to free text 
limitations  to be shared with BioCryst. Therefore, the initial report and photographs should be 
submitted by [CONTACT_13658] a very short period of time and under no circumstances 
should this period exceed 24 hours following assessment of the event.   
The follow-up report should contain information about the clinical course, medical evaluation, 
additional photographs (if relevant), biopsy (if done), and laboratory results. 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405734] be followed through the end of the pregnancy. While pregnancy is not 
considered an AE, all cases of fetal drug exposure via the parent as a study participant (including 
partners of study participants) are to be reported immediately to BioCryst or its designee. 
Consent from a pregnant partner of a study participant will be obtained prior to reporting any 
details of the pregnancy. Information related to the pregnancy must be given on a “Pregnancy Confirmation and Outcome” form that will be provided by [CONTACT_281981]. Any AEs or SAEs experienced by a 
pregnant subject are to be reported as directed above in Section 
12.1.[ADDRESS_405735]’s pregnant partner should be reported on the Pregnancy 
Confirmation and Outcome form. All pregnancies must be followed to outcome which occurs 
when an infant is delivered (live or still born), there is fetal demise, or there is an abortion (spontaneous or induced). Abortion (spontaneous or induced), fetal demise, and still birth along with congenital abnormalities in the newborn, should be reported as separate SAEs. 
12.1.7. Serious Breaches of Good Clinical Practice  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to notify the licensing authority of any serious breach of 
Good Clinical Practice which is likely to effect, to a significant degree, the safety or mental 
integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the study. All serious breaches will 
be notified to the relevant competent authority within [ADDRESS_405736] for recurrence of the AE as appropriate. In addition, other extenuating circumstances 
may lead to treatment interruptions such as vomiting during an abdominal HAE attack or required fasting for medical procedures; in these cases, study drug should be resumed once the 
extenuating circumstance is resolved. Treatment interruptions following suspected drug- related 
rashes are discussed in Section 12.2.1. 
The exception to treatment interruption and resumption is when study drug is stopped for a rash 
considered study drug related (possibly, probably, definitely related). If study drug is interrupted 
for >  10 days due to a related drug rash, study drug may not be restarted. However, interruption 
for ≤  10 days will be allowed because the study drug’s long half- life would allow sufficient 
plasma concentrations to remain for safe reintroduction of study drug.  
The Sponsor Medical Monitor should be notified in the event of a treatment interruption due to 
an AE. Any treatment interruption will be recorded in the CRF and source documents, including the reason for the interruption. 
12.1.9. Emergency Procedures  
Access to study drug/IMP assignment will be available immediately through the IXRS system if 
the Investigator deems it necessary to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s medical 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405737]. The Sponsor Medical Monitor will not be involved in the decision to unblind. 
12.2. Toxicity Management  
The Investigator (or qualified designee) will grade clinically significant events and laboratory abnormalities according to that detailed in Section 12.1.3. Grade 3 and 4 clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities should be confirmed by [CONTACT_328573], unless such a delay is not consistent with good medical practice. 
In the event that a new clinically significant safety signal emerges, a meeting of the DMC may 
be convened by [CONTACT_328574]. 
Based on the data presented, a decision will be made as to whether to halt the study, to continue dosing, or to continue dosing with provisions introduced into the protocol via substantial amend ment.  
12.2.1. Rash  
Special evaluation of diffuse maculopapular drug rash is required as per Section 11.2.14 and special reporting is described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
Management of rash should be based on best medical practice and address the subject’s presentation. If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or 4 rash suspected to be due to study drug/IMP, 
the subject should have study drug/IMP dosing stopped immediately as per Section 8.3.2. 
Grade [ADDRESS_405738] desquamation, or ulceration; 
Grade 4 rashes would encompass rashes with mucous membrane involvement or significant 
exfoliation, erythema multiforme, suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or necrosis requiring surgery. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Administration for Grade [ADDRESS_405739] is considered to be deriving benefit. By 
[CONTACT_281984], this reaction would be described as pruritus and/or erythema (Grade 1) or a 
diffuse maculo -papular rash and/or dry desquamation (Grade 2). In addition, subjects would have 
to be constitutionally well (no fever, no change in appetite, no malaise, etc), have no mucosal 
involvement, no vesicles and have no clinically significant lab abnormalities in relevant analytes 
such as liver enzymes and creatinine. Mild or moderate eosinophilia may be present but should not prevent continuation of study drug if all other criteria are met. Rash treatment should 
primarily address symptoms (ie, antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_235972], and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_030]). Oral corticosteroids should be avoided, as there is no evidence that oral corticosteroids benefit patients with bland drug- related cutaneous reactions. Subjects who remain 
on study drug should be followed closely until the rash resolves. 
If the subject’s rash does not improve, or worsens to include vesicles, wet desquamation, or 
ulceration (Grade 3), then BCX7353 should be immediately discontinued.  
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405740] missed > 10 consecutive doses in 
the time since the rash was noted. Results from an y assessments described in Section  11.2.14, 
including the biopsy, if performed, will be sent to the Sponsor and expert group (if applicable) as 
they become available to better inform the suspected diagnosis, pathophysiology and prognosis 
of the rash.  
12.2.2. Aminotransferase (ALT or AST) Elevation  
All baseline or treatment- emergent ALT or AST elevations > 3 × ULN (ie, Grade 3 and above) 
should be confirmed within [ADDRESS_405741] as well as total 
bilirubin, ALP, prothrombin time/INR, and complete blood count (CBC) for eosinophil levels. If subjects are asymptomatic with no other pertinent laboratory abnormality, study drug may be 
continued under close observation with weekly assessment of transaminase levels, total bilirubin, 
and ALP. These may be done at a local laboratory as long as results are reported to the Investigator as soon as they are available and the investigative site contacts the subject to 
ascertain any symptoms. If ALT or AST continue to increase and the subject remains 
asymptomatic, study drug dosing must be held if: 
• Either ALT or AST is > 5 × ULN for > 2 weeks  
• The ALT or AST reaches > 8 × ULN  
The subject should continue weekly assessment of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP, prothrombin time/INR, and  CBC for eosinophil levels until ALT and/or AST are < 3 × ULN. 
Provided specific criteria are met, the Investigator and subject may elect to resume BCX7353 
dosing. All of the following criteria must be met for dosing to resume. 
• The subject is considered to  have been deriving benefit from BCX7353 prior to holding 
study drug. 
• Transaminases return to ≤ 2 × ULN for subjects whose baseline transaminase levels were above the ULN, and ≤ ULN for those whose baseline transaminase levels were ≤ ULN.  
• Subjects have not initiated or restarted androgens during the period BCX7353 was held. 
• The subject agrees to continue weekly monitoring of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP, 
CBC (eosinophil levels) and prothrombin/INR until levels appear stable and transaminase levels remain < 3 × ULN for at least [ADDRESS_405742] P harmaceuticals, Inc.

91 12.2.3. Overdose  
To date there is no experience with overdose of oral BCX7353. Single doses of up to 1000 mg, 
7 days of dosing up to 500 mg/day, and 14 days of dosing with 350 mg/day revealed no 
clinically sig nificant safety concerns in healthy subjects. Safety data generated in 
Study BCX7353-203 with 28-day dosing of up to 350 mg/day revealed no clinically significant 
safety concerns in subjects with HAE. Subsequently, subjects enrolled in BCX7353-106 were 
exposed to BCX7353 450 mg QD for 14 days without any unanticipated  AEs or increased AE 
severity.  
In the event that study personnel become aware of an overdose of study drug/IMP (> 1 dose per calendar day) that is associated with an AE, both the overdose and the resultant event should be reported as AEs. Overdose without any symptoms (ie, AEs) does not need to be reported as an 
AE. If overdose occurs with or without associated AEs, subjects should undergo clinical and 
laboratory monitoring as appropriate for their clinical condition and, if indicated, should receive clinically -indicated supportive therapy. Overdose without associated signs or symptoms should 
not be recorded as an AE but should be recorded as a protocol deviation. 
Additional information about overdose as an AE or SAE is discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.3. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent DMC will review the safety data from this study in concert with the cumulative 
safety information generated across the BCX7353 clinical development program. The  DMC will 
convene and review safety data in Part [ADDRESS_405743] completes 
8   minimum of 8 weeks of data in addition to all previously available safety data in aggregate 
from both Parts 1 and 2). The final efficacy analysis at  [ADDRESS_405744] completed Part 1, the DMC 
will transition to meet every 12 weeks until approximately 200 subjects across BCX7353-204 
and the current study (BCX7353-302) have completed [ADDRESS_405745] country globally. A formal meeting of the DMC members will not be required; however, if the data review identifies any concern, the DMC 
members may elect to hold a formal meeting. In addition, the emergence of a new clinically 
significant safety signal may prompt an ad hoc DMC review. Where possible, scheduled DMC reviews and meetings for this protocol may be aligned with those of other protocol(s). 
At any point, the DMC will be allowed to request various levels of unblinding to fully evaluate 
subject safety .  
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405746] in reduction of HAE attacks during 24 weeks of prophylactic BCX7353 (at either 150 mg QD or 110 mg QD) will be superior to placebo.  
For each BCX7353 dose, the hypotheses can be expressed as  
Null hypothesis (H
0): R A -Rp = 0 
Alternative hypothesis (H 1): R A– R p< 0 
Where the R A is the investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate on BCX7353 and R p is the HAE 
investigator- confirmed attack rate on placebo  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the monthly Investigator- confirmed HAE attack rate in the 
entire treatment period (Day 1 [post-dose] to Day  [ADDRESS_405747] will be performed at the 5% level of significance. All 
hypothesis tests will be 2 -sided. Each BCX7353 dose will be compared to placebo in the primary 
analysis.  
To account for the multiplicity of two BCX7353 doses, the Hochberg's step-up testing procedure 
will be used to control the overall type I error.  
The primary objective of the study will be fulfilled at Week  24. The Hochberg step -up procedure 
will be used to control multiplicity of the 2 BCX7353 comparisons to placebo, 1 comparison for 
each dose. The error rate is controlled at the 5% level. Success will be declared when either 
active dose is shown to be statistically significantly different from placebo. With the Hochberg procedure, the p-values for the two doses are ordered. If the maximum p- value i s < 0.05, success 
for both doses will be declared. If the maximum p- value is ≥  0.05, then the p-value for the other 
comparison must be < 0.025 to be able to declare success for that dose only.   
13.2. Sample Size Considerations  
The pooled SD of the attack rate d uring effective dosing period in Study BCX7353-203 was 
0.55. The observed treatment difference between 125 mg and placebo was 0. 66 attacks/week, 
representing a 71% reduction in attack rate from the placebo group. The difference between the combined 125 mg and 250 mg group vs. placebo was 0.53, representing a 57% reduction.   
Assuming a normalized placebo attack rate of [ADDRESS_405748] 94% power to detect a

Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
93 50% attack rate reduction (a treatment difference of 0.5 units) between BCX7353 and placebo, 
based on a 2- sided test at significance level of 0.05.  
13.3. Sample Size Re -estimation  
A blinded sample size re-estimation is planned to address uncertainty of the variability in the SD of the HAE attack rate. An interim analysis may be performed after 50% subjects have 
completed [ADDRESS_405749] 90% power to detect a 50% 
attack rate reduction. The study will remain blinded and the interim analysis will be based on pooled data for sample size re -estimation.  
The final sample size will be the maximum of either the initial sample size (32 per group)  or the 
re-estimated sample size.  
13.4. Stratification  
Randomization of subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_328575] (≥ 2 attacks/month vs. < 2 attacks/month) 
13.5. Statistical Methods  
A detailed SAP will be developed to describe the methods of analyses and summaries, including all endpoints, time points, populations, missing data, etc. Deviations from the analyses outlined in the SAP will be described in the clinical study report.  
13.5.1. Anal ysis Populations 
The analysis populations are defined below. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Screen Failures  
Subjects who give written informed consent but are not randomized to study treatment are noted 
as screen failures in the eCRF are considered screen failures.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intent -to-Treat Population 
The ITT population will include all subjects who are randomized. The ITT population will be used as the primary population for efficacy analyses. Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment to which they were randomized.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least 1  capsule of study drug. This 
population will be used for all analyses of accountability, demographics, BCX7353 drug concentrations, and safety. Subjects will be analyzed base d on the actual treatment received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Per Protocol Population 
The Per Protocol (PP) population will include subjects in the safety population that complete Part 1. A decision will be made prior to database lock on which (if any) subjects are to be 
excluded from the PP population based upon major protocol deviations. In the per-protocol 
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
94 analysis, subjects will be assessed based on the actual treatment received on study Day 1. The PP 
population may be used as a secondary population for efficacy analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Comple ters Population 
Subjects in the ITT population who complete Part 1 of the study will comprise the completers 
population, which will be used for a sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy analysis for Part 1 only. Data will be analyzed according to rand omized treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamic Population 
The PD population for plasma kallikrein inhibition will include all subjects for whom at least 1 pre - and postdose plasma kallikrein inhibition result can be estimated. This population will be 
used for all anal yses of plasma kallikrein inhibition.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Population 
The PK/PD population will include all subjects for whom at least 1  pre- and postdose plasma 
kallikrein inhibition result can be estimated with a corresponding plasma BCX7353 
concentration (placebo samples not analyzed will be assumed to have a zero concentration). This 
population will be used for all correlation analyses of plasma kallikrein inhibition and plasma BCX7353 concentrations. 
13.5.2. General Considerations for Data Analysis 
In general, descriptive summaries will include n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum 
for continuous variables and n and percent for categorical variables. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_15449]. 
All individual subject data will be listed as measured. All statistical summaries and analyses will 
be performed using SAS
® software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, [LOCATION_003]). 
13.5.3. Subject Demographic and Disposition Data  
Demographic data and baseline characteristics including age, gender, race and ethnicity, height, 
weight, BMI, and HAE history including medication history will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. 
Subject disposition will be presented for all subjects. The number of subjects who complete the 
study and those who discontinue from the study will be provided. The reasons for early 
discontinuation also will be presented. A tabulation of the number of subjects exposed to study drug and duration of exposure will also be presented for each treatment group. Treatment 
adherence, dose interruptions, and reason for dose interruptions will be provided as summaries or 
listed as appropriate.  
13.5.4. Analysis of Efficacy Variables 
The primary efficacy analyses will be based on Part [ADDRESS_405750] P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
95 Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_328576]7353. 
HAE attacks will generally be summarized over 2  treatment periods : the entire dosing period and 
the steady -state or effective dosing period. The entire dosing period (Day 1 through Day 168, 
inclusive) is the date of first dose to the last dose in Part 1 on Day 168 + [ADDRESS_405751] dose of the study drug, whichever is earlier.  
The effective dosing period (Day 8 through Day 168, inclusive) is the date of first dose + [ADDRESS_405752] dose in Part 1 on Day 168 + [ADDRESS_405753] dose of the study drug, whichever is earlier.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the entire treatment period of Part 1.  
The attack rate and the treatment comparisons between each BCX7353 dose and placebo in the 
rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the entire dosing period will be analyzed 
using a Poisson regression model. The number of investigator-confirmed attacks will be included 
as the dependent variable, the treatment will be included as a fixed e ffect, the stratification 
variable (baseline monthly attack rate) will be included as a covariate and the logarithm of 
duration on treatment will be included as an offset variable . The estimated rate of attack for each 
treatment group, the treatment differ ences expressed as the attack rate ratio (BCX7353 over 
placebo rate ratio) and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be provided from the Poisson regression model. 
The Poisson model assumes that the mean and variance are equal. When the variance in the data 
is larger than the mean, the model is said to be over-dispersed. The assumptions of the Poisson model will be examined by [CONTACT_328577]-dispersion by [CONTACT_328578]. If there is evidence of overdispersion, a negative binomial model will be used in place 
of the Poisson regression model. 
The potential impact of missing data on the primary efficacy outcome will be explored. 
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to support the primary analysis. This will include a nalyses 
based on subjects who completed study and on those in the PP population. Missing data analyses 
will include imputation or use of data collected post- discontinuation for subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to Part 2. Details of missing data imputation will be provided in 
the SAP.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
Part 1 secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Change from baseline in AE- QoL at Week 24 (total score)  
• Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms through 24 weeks 
• Rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during dosing in the effective treatment period (beginning on Day 8 through 24 weeks) 
Part 1 exploratory efficacy endpoints include: 
• Number and proportion of subjects with no attacks over [ADDRESS_405754] P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL  BCX7353-302 
96 • Use of HAE attack medications over 24 weeks  
• The proportion of responders to study drug, defined as at least a 50% relative 
reduction in the rate of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during treatment compared with the baseline attack rate  
Treatment compar isons in the AE-QoL total score change from baseline will be analyzed using a 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an unstructured covariance matrix. The estimated treatment difference for each BCX7353 
dose–placebo at each visit will be displayed together with the 95% confidence interval and the 
associated p -value. Primary inferences will be drawn from treatment differences for the changes 
from baseline derived from the MMRM model at Week 24. The change from baseline in the AE -
QoL domain scores (function, fatigue, nutrition, and fear/shame) will also be analyzed using a MMRM model.  
The secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized and listed. The 
between -treatment comparisons will be per formed using the similar Poisson regression model for 
the Investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the effective treatment period. The between 
treatment comparison for the responder endpoints will be performed using 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel, Chi-square, or Fisher’s exact test. Multiplicity adjustments for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be described in the SAP. 
Additional related details of HAE attacks (eg, symptoms, anatomical location, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency room visits, and attack duration) wi ll be summarized and listed. Details of these 
analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
The efficacy endpoints for Parts 2 and 3 include: 
• Number and rate of HAE attacks  
• Durability of response (attack rate trend over time) 
• Number and proportion of days with angioedema symptoms 
• Use of HAE attack medications  
• Discontinuations due to lack of efficacy (through Week 48 only) 
• Durability in AE -QoL questionnaire scores 
• Durability in EQ -5D- 5L scores  
• Durability in TSQM scores 
• Durability in WPAI scores 
The analyses of efficacy  at the end of the study will be provided descriptively. For the placebo 
subjects switched to an active BCX7353 dose, the change from placebo to the active dosing 
period will be summarized. The details of the planned efficacy analyses for the entir e study will 
be provided in the SAP.  
13.5.5. Planned Analyses  
A single, blinded interim analysis for the purposes of possible sample size re- estimation may be 
performed after 50% of the subjects complete 24 weeks (See Section  13.3) .  
Protocol BioCryst P harmaceuticals, Inc.  
Version 3.[ADDRESS_405755] completes Week  24 of the study.  
The Sponsor and all other personnel who are blinded to study treatment will remain blinded to 
Part 1 treatment until after the database has been locked and the primary analysis conducted.  
13.5.6. Analysis of Safety Variables 
The safety analyses will be analyzed separately for Part 1; Parts 1, 2, and 3 will be combined for 
a long- term safety assessment.  
Safety endpoints that will be summarized include, at a minimum, the number and proportion of subjects 1) with a TEAE; 2) who discontinue BCX7353 due to a TEAE 3) who experience a TESAE; 4) who experience a treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 AE; and 5) who experience a 
treatment -emergent Grade 3 or  4 laboratory abnormality. In addition, the proportion of subjects 
with a treatment- emergent, treatment -related AE consistent with a drug rash will also be 
summarized.  
Adverse events will be mapped to a Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
preferred term and system organ class (SOC). The occurrence of TEAEs will be summarized 
using MedDRA preferred terms, SOC, and severity. Separate summaries of TEAEs, TESAEs, AEs considered to be related to study drug, and AEs leading to study drug interruption or to discontinuation will be generated. All AEs will be listed for individual subjects showing both verbatim and preferred terms.  
Descriptive summaries of vital signs, weight, bedside ECG parameters, and clini cal laboratory 
results will be presented. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the DMID Adult 
Toxicity Table (Publish Date: Draft, November 2007; Appendix 16.1).  
Any graded abnormality that occurs following the initiation of study drug and represents at least 1-grade increase from the baseline assessment is defined as treatment -emergent. The number and 
percentage of subjects who expe rience treatment -emergent graded toxicities will be summarized . 
Laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to worst postbaseline assessments will be summarized.  
Clinically significant abnormal morphological ECG findings will be summarized.  
The change from baseline in QTcF will be determined by [CONTACT_328579]. At each time point ECGs are analyzed, an individual subject’s change from baseline will be calculated as:  
∆
ik= (QTcF for subject at time point k – Baseline QTcF)  
Where QTcF measurements will be the average of triplicate ECGs at baseline and single values at each time point.  
For routine ECGs, the number and proportion of subjects with QTcF ≤  450, > 450 to ≤  480, 
> 480 to ≤  500, and > 500 msec; or changes of ≤  30, > 30 to ≤  60, or > [ADDRESS_405756] P harmaceuticals, Inc.

98 13.5.7. Health Outcome Analyses  
Health Outcome endpoints are as follows: 
• EQ-5D- 5L scores  
• TSQM scores  
• WPAI scores  
The between -treatment comparisons for, EQ- 5D-5L, TSQM, and WPAI will be performed using 
a mixe d-effect model, including terms of treatment, visit, treatment and visit interaction, and 
baseline score. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
13.5.8. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma samples for determination of BCX7353 concentrations are planned to be collected a t 
Baseline/Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 48 and e arly t ermination (if applicable). 
The resulting PK data will be pooled in a meta- analysis to facilitate population PK analyses.  
13.5.9. Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Plasma kallikrein inhibition data will be expressed as percent inhibition compared to subject 
baseline activity. Ex  vivo plasma kallikrein activity will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], treatment, day, and 
time and summarized separately by [CONTACT_3148], day, and time. Descriptive statistics will be 
reporte d. Mean and individual plasma kallikrein inhibition vs. time profiles will be plotted by 
[CONTACT_1570]. 
13.5.10. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Exposure-response analyses of the relationships between plasma kallikrein inhibition, efficacy 
endpoints, and BCX7353 plasma concentrations may be explored using model-based techniques as applicable.

100 assent will be obtained based on those requirements. Each parent/caregiver and subject should be 
given both verbal and written information describing the nature and duration of the clinical 
study. The informed consent process should take place under conditions where the parent/caregiver has adequate time to consider the risks and  benefits associated with his/her 
child’s participation in the study. Subjects will not be screened or treated until the parent/caregiver and subject has signed an approved ICF and assent form written in a language in which the subject is fluent. The ICF and assent forms that are used must be approved both by 
[CONTACT_281987]/IEC. The ICF and assent forms should be in accordance with 
the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, and BioCryst policy. 
The Investigator must explain to potential subjects and their parent/caregiver the aims, methods, 
reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the trial and any discomfort it may 
entail. Each parent/caregiver will be informed that they are free for their child not to participate 
in the trial and that they may withdraw consent for their child to participate at any time. They 
will be told that refusal for their child to participate in the study will not prejudice future treatment. They will also be  told that their child’s records may be examined by [CONTACT_281990].  
Parents/caregivers and subjects must be given the o pportunity to ask questions. After this 
explanation and before entry into the trial, consent and assent should be appropriately recorded 
by [CONTACT_281991]’s/caregiver’s dated signature. The parent/caregiver should receive a signed and dated copy of the ICF, and the assent. The original signed informed consent and 
assent should be retained in the study files. The Investigator shall maintain a log of all subjects 
for whom consent was signed and indicate if the subject was enrolled into the study or reason for non-enrollment.  
14.1.5. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator will provide timely reports regarding safety to his/her IRB/IEC as required. 
14.2. Study Monitoring  
During trial conduct, BioCryst or its designee will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. The monitors will review source documents to 
confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The Investigator and institution will allow 
BioCryst representatives, monitors, or its designees direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
It is important that the Principal Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
14.3. Quality Assurance  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_281922]/IEC, and/or by a quality assurance group for audits performed by [CONTACT_281992], or its designee, and/or to inspection by [CONTACT_4708].

possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
14.4. Study Termination and Site Closure  
Overall, the Sponsor may suspend enrollment into the study, suspend treatment of ongoing subjects, or terminate the study to ensure that subjects’ safety and welfare are protected. The entire study, or individual sites, may be terminated for any of the following reasons: 
• Changes in sci entific knowledge that lead to a negative impact on the risk/benefit 
profile for subjects 
• Request of BioCryst or competent public authorities/IRB/IEC 
• If recruitment cannot be completed in specified time frame  
• If the permit to manufacture or import IMP is r evoked  
• If the study drug becomes commercially available or another mechanism is available to provide drug to the subject 
BioCryst reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. After such a decision, the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_281993]. As directed by [CONTACT_281992], all study materials must be collected and all CRFs 
completed to the greatest extent possible. 
An individual trial center that is determined to be unsuitable by [CONTACT_2728], competent public 
authorities or IRB/IEC may be terminated, without affecting the other trial sites.  
Except for those situations outlined in Section 8.[ADDRESS_405758]’s best interest. 
14.5. Records Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or BioCryst, the Investigator agrees to keep record s, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information 
to link records, CRFs, and medical/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs, all original signed 
assents (where applicable), all CRFs, and detailed records of study drug accountability and 
treatment disposition. The records should be retained by [CONTACT_328581], whichever is longer. 
If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the study 
records may be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or to BioCryst. The Investigator must obtain BioCryst’s written permission before 
disposing of any records and must notify BioCryst before transferring any records to another 
facility.

 (< 48 hours);
 no medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 2  Moderate   Mild to moderate limitation in 
activity - some assistance may be needed; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy required  
GRADE 3  Sever e   Marked limitation in activity, some 
assistance usually requ ired; medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281925] 4  Life-threatening  Extreme limitation in activity, 
significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281926] -THREATENING AEs  
 
ANY clinical 
event deemed by [CONTACT_135956] -threatening should be 
considered a grade  4 event.  Clinical events considered to be serious or life -threatening 
include, but are not limited to:  seizures, coma , tetany, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, diffuse petechiae, paralysis, acute psychosis, 
severe depression.  
 
COMMENTS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE TAB LES  
 
• Standardized and commonly used toxicity tables (Division of AIDS, NCI’ s 
Common To
xicity Criteria (CTC), and World Health Organization (WHO)) have 
been adapted for use by [CONTACT_71513] 
(DMID) and modified to better meet the needs of participants in DMID trials.  
 
•  For para
meters not included in the following Toxicity Tables, sites should refer to 
the “Guide For Estimating Severity Grade”  located above.  
 
• Criteria are
 generally grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  
 
• Some proto
cols may have additional protocol specific grading criteria, which will 
supercede the use of these tables for specified criteria.

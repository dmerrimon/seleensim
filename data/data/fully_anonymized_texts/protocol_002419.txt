Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:
Inclusion c riteria
Each patient must meet all the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:
1.The patient has a documented diagnosis of t ype 1 Gaucher disease, as documented by 
[CONTACT_418742] (GCB) activity  in leukocy tes (whole blood only ) or cultu red 
skin fibroblasts. Diagnosis by  [CONTACT_418743]. Diagnosis may be 
based on results obtained prior to Screening if documented in the patient’s medical history . 
2. Patients must have a L S BMD Z -score < -1 or BMD T -score of < -[ADDRESS_528177] received ERT or SRT in the 12 months prior 
to enrollment.
4.The patient is ≥18 and ≤[ADDRESS_528178] agree to use a medicall y acceptable method 
of contraception at all times during the stud y. (See Section 6.8.3 for acceptable methods of 
contraception).
6.The patient, or patient’s legally  authorized representative (s), if applicable, understands the 
nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study and has provided written informed 
consent that has been approved b y the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (I RB/IEC).
7.The patient must be sufficiently  cooperative to participate in this clinical study as judged 
by [CONTACT_093].
Exclusion criteria
Patients who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:
1.Neurological s ymptoms indicating that the patient may  have t ype [ADDRESS_528179] study  data or confound the study  results (eg, malignancies, 
primary  biliary  cirrhosis, autoimmune liver disease, etc).
3.Any osteoporosis- specific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with ery thropoietin 
(or erythropoietin -like substances) during the past year.
4. Structural, joint- associated bone damage of such extent and severity  that t he investigator 
deems it could impact participation in the study  and assessment of relevant study  endpoints 
(eg, pain).
5.The patient is pregnant or lactating.
6.The patient has had a splenectom y.(This criterion is not meant to exclude subjects who 
have acces sory spleens.)
7.The patient is enrolled in another clinical stud y that involves clinical investigations or use 
of an y investigational product (drug or device) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or 
at an y time during the study. 
8.Severe vitamin D deficiency  to the level that would be expected to result in osteomalacia 
(vitamin D < 10 ng/mL [25 nmol/L ]). If there is mild vitamin D insufficiency  at screening 
(vitamin D >10 and < 30 ng/mL) treat with 4000 IU vitamin D per day  for 1 month and

Statistical Methods: 
Statistical analy ses will be based on the intent- to-treat (ITT) principle for all efficacy  
variables. The ITT anal ysis will be based on all enrolled patients who received at least 1 study
drug infusion (full or partial). Summary statistics will be provided for the changes and 
percent changes from baseline for each parameter . Two -sided 95% confidence intervals in 
themean changes and mean percent changes from baseline will be presented for each 
endpoint.
Continuous data collected at baseline and subsequent study  visits will be summarized, and the 
mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values for each variable will be 
tabulated to facilitate the search for trends over time tha t may  be attributable to study  drug. 
Categorical variables will be presented in terms of frequencies and percent. Within patient 
changes from baseline will be examined using [ADDRESS_528180] 1 study  drug infusion (full or partial). Safet y will be evaluated on the 
basis of AEs reported, clinical laboratory  data, use of concomitant medications, vital signs, and 
physical examinations. In addition, blood samples will be analy zed for determination of the 
presence of anti -velaglucerase alfa antibodies.
Sample Size 
Determination
In aprevious protocol version ( Amendment 4), approximately  40 patients were planned for 
enrollment in order to achieve a total of 34 evaluable patients (driven b y the key  secondary  
efficacy  endpoint), assuming a 15 % drop- out rate. A total of 34 evaluable p atients provided 
99% power to detect a significant change in L S BMD Z -score from baseline after 24 months of 
treatment (primary  efficacy  endpoint) when in fact there is a +0.6 change (improvement) in 
Z-score. The calculation assumed an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_528181]) and a standard deviation of 
change of 0.6 based on data from stud y HGT -GCB -044. The 34 evaluable patients also 
conferred 80% power to detect a significant change in one of the key  secondary  endpoints, 
namely  the change from baseline in L S BMD Z-score after 12 months of treatment. 
Assumptions for the key  secondary  endpoint power calculation were also based on study  
HGT -GCB -044 in which a +0.[ADDRESS_528182] deviation of 0.5. 
In the previous amendment (Amendmen t 5), the number of patients planned for enrolment was 
revised based on the patient recruitment and retention experience to date to allow for a more 
realistic and achievab le recruitment target. Cumulative enrollment data collected from study  
initiation to date indicate a suboptimal enrollment rate of 0.5 patient permonth.

Study enrollment is hindered b y the considerable prevalence of screen failures (approximately  
50%) res ulting from the limited global pool of naïve patients with Gaucher disease who 
demonstrate bone involvement at baseline and who meet the eligibility  criteria of this study .
Based on this information, the number of patients planned for enrollment was reduce d to at 
least [ADDRESS_528183] an eligible DXA score at Baseline and at 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]).The 
number of evaluable patients was determined assuming a drop -out rate of 30% based on the 
rate of earl y discontinuations reported during the first [ADDRESS_528184] size (increase in L S BMD Z -score of +0.6) and standard 
deviation (0.6) values at 24 months from study  HGT -GCB -044, the study  will be 90% powered 
to detect significant changes (alpha 0.05) in L S BMD Z -score at 24 month s(primary  efficacy  
endpoint). As the revised sample size no longer provides adequate statistical power for the
detect ion of signi ficant changes in the key  secondary  endpoints defined in the previous 
protocol version, those were demoted to secondary  endpoints in the current amendment .

1INTRODUCTION
1.1 Bone Pathology in Gaucher Disease - An Unmet Medical Need
Gaucher disease, a pan -ethnic, autosomal, recessive disease with an estimated 30,000 persons 
with type 1 disease worldwide (Cox and Schofield, 1997), is the most common 
glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage disorder (Cox et al., 2003). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_418726] -ethnicity  ofthe 
disorder, there is a particularly high prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The disease 
occurs when an inherited deficiency  of the l ysosomal enzy me glucocerebrosidase (GCB) leads to 
progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macroph ages and subsequent tissue and 
organ damage. Glucocerebrosidase is required for hy drolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and 
cerebroside. 
Gaucher disease is a multisy stem disorder with clinical features reflective of the distribution of 
abnormal macropha ges (Gaucher cells) in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, skeleton, lungs, and 
occasionall y, lymph nodes (Beutler and Grabowski, 2001 ).Accumulation of 
glucocerebroside -containing cells (mainly  macrophages or macrophage -like cells) in the liver
and spleen leads to secondary  changes, including organomegal y, which can be massive, 
particularl y in the case of the spleen. Bone involvement results in skeletal abnormalities and 
deformities as well as bone pain and bone crises. Deposits in the bone marr ow and splenic 
sequestration lead to d ysfunction with clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
The disease has been classified into 3 clinical subty pes based on the presence or absence of 
neurological s ymptoms and severit y of neurological symptoms (Beutler and Grabowski, 2001 ).
Type1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all cases,
(Pastore s et al., 2004 )does not involve the CNS; ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_418727] y, 
splenomegaly , thrombocy topenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia, hy permetabolism, skeletal 
pathology , growth retardation, pulmonary  disease, and decreased quality  of life (QoL) (Pastores 
et al., 2004 ).Patients with ty pe [ADDRESS_528193]; enzy me replacement therapy  (ERT) has been the 
cornerstone of treatment for Gaucher disease since the early  1990s and is highl y effective in 
improving man y of the clinical manifestations (Cox et al., 2003).
1.2 Experience with ERT for Bone -related Complications of Gaucher Disease 
Data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) demonstrate that 
approximately  90% of all patients with Gaucher disease should achieve normal hemoglobin 
concentration within 2 years of i nitiation of treatment (Cox et al., 2003). Enzy me replacement 
therap y reduces organomegal y, improves hematological parameters, and positively  impacts
health- related QoL (Weinreb et al., 2002; Masek et al., 1999).
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y since [ADDRESS_528194] ERT for Gaucher disease, the management 
of the 
skeletal manifestations of the disease remains a significant unmet medical need. Skeletal 
complications are a frequent occurrence in patients with Gaucher disease.

velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) [ADDRESS_528195] 19patients will be enrolled to receive VPRI V at the 
recommended starting dose for treatment -naïve patients of 60 U/kg EOW by a minimum 
60-minute intravenous infusion. To be considered evaluable, a patient must have an eligible 
DXA score at Baseline and at 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]).
The primary  endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in LS 
BMD Z -score. Bone mineral densit y will b e measured using DXA, and the results will be 
converted to Z- scores appropriate for the patient’s age, sex, and race. 
See Appendix 1 for the Study  Schedule of Events table.
4.2 Rationale for Study Design and Comparator Group
Bone -related problems are a critic al unmet medical need in Gaucher disease and there is reason 
to believe that treatment with VPRI V may  lead to significant bone and bone -related effects as 
early as 12 months after initiation of treatment in ERT -naïve patients. Twenty -one

Velaglucerase alfa is supplied as a sterile, preservative- free, l yophilized powder in single -use 
vials.
6.1.2 Comparator
Not applicable.
6.2 Treatment Adminis tered
All enrolled patients will receive VPRIV b y aminimum 60-minute intravenous infusion at the 
recommended approved starting dose for treatment- naïve patients of 60 U/kg EOW. Patients will 
continue to receive 60 U/kg EOW for 24 months (101 weeks). A 30 -day follow -up period is 
planned after the final dose. 
6.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
All enrolled patients will receive VPRIV at the same dose, ie, 60 U/kg EOW, which is the 
recommended approved starting dose for patients who are naïve to E RT and SRT for Gaucher 
disease. The first dose of VPRI V will be based on the patient’s weight at screening (Day s -28 to 
Day -4). A change in patient weight of ±5% from screening or the last weight used to recalculate 
the dose will require a new dose recalc ulation by  [CONTACT_977]. Weight will be measured every  
12weeks throughout the study , with an y dosing adjustment to be completed prior to the next 
dose. When a weight change of ±5% is identified, the dose should be adjusted as soon as 
possible, but no later than the next bi- weekly  study  visit. If the dose can be adjusted prior to the 
infusion on the same day, this adjustment should be performed; however, if the dose cannot be 
adjusted on the same day, the dose must be adjusted prior to the next bi -weekly  infusion. It is 
acceptable for the dose adjustment to occur at either of the following times in the study :
1)The dose adjustment to occur on the same day  a weight change of ±5% from the 
screening weight or weight at last dose adjustment is identified at t he clinic site 
(
Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89); or
2)
The dose adjustment to occur at the next bi- weekly  study  visit after a weight change of 
±5% from the screening weight or weight at last dose adjustment is identified at the clinic 
site ( Weeks 1 3, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89).
For dosing calculations, patient weight can be rounded to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_528203] 0.1 mL
Study  drug infusions are to occur on approximately  the same day  of the week, but may  occu r 
every  14 day s (±7 day s) of the target day  in order to facilitate patient scheduling. If at all 
possible, missed infusions should be avoided.

The management of IRRs should be based on the severit y of the reaction. Such manage ment may  
include, at the discretion of the investigator, slowing the infusion rate, treatment with 
medications such as antihistamines, antipy retics, and/or corticosteroids and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_418728].
Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in 
those cases where s ymptomatic treatment was previously  required. Pretreatment of infusion 
reactions is left to the clinical judgment of the investigator.
In cases when require d and at the discretion of the study  site, additional clinical laboratory  
samples may  be collected for further anal ysis of IRRs. Suggested laboratory  evaluation includes 
complete blood count, complete metabolic panel including liver and renal function test s, CH50, 
C3, C4, C1 inhibitor, C3a and C5a, total try ptase, histamine, immune complex and serum IgE 
levels .
6.8 Restrictions
6.8.1 Prior Therapy
The use of an y osteoporosis -specific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with 
erythropoietin within the past y ear is an exclusion criterion. To be eligible for the study , patients 
are to be treatment -naïve (ie, have not received ERT or SRT in the 12 months prior to study

7.[ADDRESS_528216] Administration
All doses of VPRI V will be administered by  [CONTACT_119654]. Study  drug 
infusions are to occur on approximately  the same day  of the week but may  occur every  14days 
(±7days of the target day ) in order to facilitate patient scheduling. If at all possible, missed 
infusions should be avoided. If a patient is not dosed within [ADDRESS_528217] 60 minutes (1 hour). For example, a 60 U/kg dose will be 
delivered at a rate of at least 1 U/kg/minute. The infus ion of VPRI V will be delivered 
intravenously  with an in -line sterilizing filter ( 0.2 micron or 0.22 micron) .
The dose of VPRIV will be calculated based on the patient’s weight determined at screening. A 
change in weight of ±5% from screening or the previous weight assessment in the study  will 
require recalculation of the dose.
If a patient experiences an infusion- related AE (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) during the 
infusion of investigational product, the investigator should decide, based on his or her cl inical 
judgment, whether the infusion should be slowed or temporaril y or permanently discontinued.
Patients experiencing recurrent infusion -related AEs may  be pre -medicated, as described in 
Section 6.6. If infusions continue without incident, then tapering of medications can be 
considered.

The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild:     A ty pe of AE that is usually  transient and may  require onl y minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual activities of daily  
living.
Moderate:     A ty pe of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activ ities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses no significant 
or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe:     A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensi ve therapeutic intervention.
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-
effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source document.
The followin g additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product , and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical 
condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident a nd no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome Categorization
The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y on the CRF. Outcomes are 
as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered /Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown

SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
[IP_ADDRESS] Symptoms of the Disease under Study
Symptoms of the disease under study  should not be classed as AEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuatio n or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy  
data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be 
recorded as an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE 
if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift 
of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of 
an alread y abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment 
or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration.
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
values which were not presen t at the pre -treatment value observed closest to the start of study  
treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the 
reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the 
abno rmal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y 
significant and whether it represents an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy
Any report of pregnancy for a female study  participant or the partner of a male study  participant 
must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department using the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and any  applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the/Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739].
The p regnant female study  participant must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant for every  pregnant female study  participant withdrawn from the study  and 
for pr egnant partners of male study  participants. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to 
obtain this information within [ADDRESS_528223] partum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_10191]. Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.

[IP_ADDRESS] Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined be low) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 7.15.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .
•Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a 
non-medical purpose (eg , to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that 
may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
•Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any  
dose (Note: this includes a situation w here the investigational product is not used as directed 
at the dose prescribed b y the protocol)
•Overdose –
Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of investigational medicinal product 
10% higher than the protocol- specified dose. 
•Medication Error – A mistake made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use 
of the investigational medicinal product
•Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered 
reportable as medication errors.
•Medication errors should be co llected/reported for all products under investigation.
•The administration and/or use of an expi[INVESTIGATOR_418730] a reportable medication error.

ofthe event. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAE s does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) unless they  result in an 
SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_373143] (Note: Source documents are not 
to be sent unless requested) and fax or e -mail the form to the Shire Global Drug Safet y
Department. A copy of the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and Non- serious AEs 
Required b y the Protocol Form (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the 
Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact [CONTACT_418751].
7.15.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
•Results in death.
•Is life -threatening. Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
•Requires inp atient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for 
pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not 
be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10153] y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
•Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
•Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect.
•Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or r equire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition.

Examples ofsuch medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
7.15.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 8.5and must be reported to 
the Shire Global Drug Safety Departmen t andthe CRO/ Shire Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_528226] awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be r eported to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet yDepartment within [ADDRESS_528227] awareness of the event.
7.15.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
inform ed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 8.5and must be reported to 
the Shire Global Drug Safety Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_528228] awareness of the event. 
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “rela ted” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet yDepartment within [ADDRESS_528229]’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For 
all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
Action taken with the investigational product should be an active decision by  [CONTACT_093]. 
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another stud y drug action was previousl y taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the 
action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not 
applicable” (if the su bject never received investigational product). The study  drug action of 
withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death.

10.2 Determination o f Sample Size
In aprevious protocol version ( Amendment 4), approximately  40 patients were planned for 
enrollment in order to achieve a total of 34 evaluable patients (driven b y the key  secondary  
efficacy  endpoint) , assuming a 15 % drop- out rate. A total of 34 evaluable patients provide d
99% power to detect a significant change in L S BMD Z -score from baseline after 24 months of 
treatment (primary  efficacy  endpoint) when in fact there is a +0.6 change (improvement) in 
Z-score. The calculation assumed an alph a of 0.05 ( 2-sided t - test) and a standard deviation of 
change of 0.6 based on data from stud y HGT -GCB -044. The 34 evaluable patients also conferred 
80% power to detect a significant change in one of the key  secondary  endpoints, namely  the 
change from basel ine in LS BMD Z -score after 12 months of treatment.

velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
Assumptions forthekeysecondary  endpoint power calculation were also based on stu dy 
HGT -GCB -044 in which a +0.[ADDRESS_528238] 
deviation of 0.5. 
In the previous amendment ( Amendment 5), the number of patients planned for enrolment was 
revised based on the patient recruitment and retention experience to date to allow for a more 
realistic and achievable recruitment target .Cumulative enrollment data collect ed from study  
initiation to date indicate a suboptimal enrollment rate of 0.5 patient permonth. Study  enrollment 
is hindered b ythe considerable prevalence of screen failure s (approximately  50%) resulting from 
the limited global pool of naïve patients wit h Gaucher disease who demonstrate bone 
involvement at baseline and who meet the eligibility criteria of this study .Based on this 
information, the number of patients planned for enrollment was reduced to at least [ADDRESS_528239] an eligible 
DXA score at Baseline and at 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]). The number of evaluable 
patients was determined assuming a drop-out rate of 30% based on the rate of early 
discontinuati ons reported during the first [ADDRESS_528240] size (increase in LS BMD Z -score of +0.6) and standard deviation (0.6)
values at 24 months from study  HGT -GCB -044, the study  will be 90% powered to detect 
significant changes (alpha 0.05) in L S BMD Z -score at 24 month s(primary  efficacy  endpoint).
As therevised sample size no longer provides adequate statistical power for the detect ion of
significant changes in the key  secondary  endpoints defined in the previous protocol version, 
those were demoted to secondary  endpoints in the current amendment.
10.[ADDRESS_528241] 1 study  drug infusion (full or partial). The safet y population will be used

10.4 Patient Disposition
Patient disposition for those enrolled, treated , completed, or discontinued/withdrew will be 
presented in summary  tables using number and percentage of patients per category ; reasons for 
discontinuation/withdrawal will be presented. 
10.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic (eg, age, sex, and race) and baseline characteristics (eg, medical history, disease 
history , and bone pathology ) will be anal yzed using the safet y population. Demographic and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized using either descriptive statistics or frequency  
distributions, as appropriate.

10.6 Primary Endpoint
10.6.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 months (Week 103 [end of 
study ]) in LS BMD Z -score as measured b y DXA. The null hy pothesis is that there is no change 
from baseline to [ADDRESS_528242] will be applied for the change from baseline of L S BMD Z -scores 
with patients whose LS BMD scores are collected after 24 months of treatment. A 95% 
confidence interval for the mean of the change from baseline will also be presented. 
As a sensitivity  anal ysis, the primary  efficacy  analy sis w ill be repeated b y apply ing last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method. That is, if the LS BMD score is missing at 
24months (Week 103 [end of study ]), the last non -missing score before [ADDRESS_528243] 1 study  drug infusi on (full or partial) will be assessed for 
clinical safet y and tolerability . The safety  population will be used for the analy ses of the safet y 
endpoints. No formal statistical tests will be performed on the safet y parameters.
The number and proportion of patients for the following parameters will be descriptivel y 
summarized:
•Study  drug -related AEs
•Infusion- related AEs
•Serious AEs
•Use of concomitant medication
•Clinically  abnormal laboratory  tests (hematology , serum chemistry , and urinaly sis)
•Positive anti -velaglucerase alfa antibody  test
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA, and tabular summaries of AEs will be based on all 
TEAEs recorded. A TEAE is defined as an y AE that occurred on or after the time of the first 
infusion of study  drug until [ADDRESS_528244] infusion of study  drug. 
The number and proportion of patients experiencing an AE will be tabulated for the following:
•Overall summary  of AEs: Recurrent AEs observed within a patient will be counted once.
•AEs by  [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferre d term (PT).
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57
SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
•AEs by  [CONTACT_2946], PT, and severity : In the case of multiple occurrences of the same AEs (at the 
PT level) in an individual patient, the AE that is classified as the most severe (ie, maximum 
severit y) will be identified.
•AEs by  [CONTACT_2946], PT, and relationship: The AE with the closest relationship to the study  drug in 
the same PT level will be reported.
•SAEs, infusion- related AEs, and AEs that led to permanent discontinuation, by [CONTACT_3592]. 
Furthermore, an SAE listing and a listing of all patients who per manentl y discontinued due to an 
AE(s) will be provided. An infusion- related AE is defined as an AE that begins either during or 
within [ADDRESS_528245] to the reference 
range.
10.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints include the following evaluations: 
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) in LS BMD Z
-score. Assessments will be 
performed at the screening visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end of stud y).
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103, end of study ) in 
LS BMD in g/c m2.
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
BMB score (MRI of LS and femur). Assessments will be performed at the baseline visit and 
Weeks 51 and 103 (end of study ).
•Change from baseline over time in hemoglobi n concentration. Assessments will be 
performed at baseline and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103 (end of study ).
•Change from baseline over time in platelet count. Assessments will be performed at baseline 
and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103 (end of study ) .
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
normalized liver volume as measured b y abdominal MRI . Assessments will be performed at 
the baseline visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end of study ).
•Chang e from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
normalized spleen volume as measured b y MRI. Assessments will be performed at the 
baseline visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end of stud y).

•Shifts in WHO BMD classification (normal bone density , osteopenia, osteoporosis), based on 
LS T -scores. Assessments will be performed at the baseline visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end 
of study ).
For WHO BMD classification based on L S T-score endpoint, the number and proportion of 
patients classified as having normal (T -score ≥-1), osteopenia (- 2.5< T -score < -1), or 
osteoporosis(T -
score ≤- 2.5) BMD will be captured; patient shifts in BMD classification based on 
T
-score will be reported. 
For the remaining secondary  efficacy  parameters, [ADDRESS_528246] or Wilcoxon signed rank 
testwill be applied for the change from baseline of each endpoint at each time point. I n this 
analysis, the LOCF method for missing values will be applied. As an additional anal ysis, a 
linear mixed -effects model will be used as a repeated measures anal ysis to investigate the 
improvement of efficacy  over time. This model uses all the clinical information obtained on a 
patient while allowing for the repeated measurements to exhibit correlation between 
observations within the same p atient. Estimates for the clinical parameters obtained over time 
will account for the baseline measurements and will be adjusted for demographic and baseline 
factors. This linear mixed- effects model will be described in more detail in a statistical anal ysis 
plan. 
The descriptive summary statistics of the percentage of change from baseline for the quantitative 
efficacy  endpoints will also be generated. 
10.7.3 Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Health Economics and Outcomes 
Research Endpoints)
Health economic and outcomes research endpoints are secondary  endpoints. These include the 
following:
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
overall fatigue as measured by [CONTACT_418746]. Assessments will be performed at the baseline visit 
and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103 (end of study ).
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
bone pain as measured by [CONTACT_418745] -SF©.
•Assessments will be performed at the basel ine visit and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 
103 (end of stud y).
For the health economics and outcomes parameters, [ADDRESS_528247] 
will be applied for the change from baseline of each endpoint at each time point. I n this anal ysis, 
the L OCF method for missing values will be applied. 
The descriptive summary statistics of the percentage of change from baseline for the quantitative 
efficacy  endpoints will also be generated.

11.6 Study Monitoring
Monitoring procedures that comply  with current GCP guidelines will be followed. Review of the 
eCRFs for completeness and clarit y, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of 
administrative matters will be performed.
The study  will be monitored by  [CONTACT_4885]. Monitoring will be performed b y a 
representative of the Sponsor (clinical stud y monitor) who will review the eCRFs and source 
documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol 
design and regulatory  requirements by  [CONTACT_194498] (letter, telephone, 
and facsimile).
11.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records
Case report forms (paper or electronic) are provided for each patient. All forms must be filled out 
by [CONTACT_233933]. All corrections to the original eCRF entry  must indicate the 
reason for change. The investigator is required to sign the eCRF after all data have been captured 
for each patient. If corrections are made after review and signature b y the investigator, he or she 
must be made aware of the changes, and his or her awareness documented by  [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-signing the 
eCRF.
11.7.1 Critical Documents
Before Shire initiates the trial (ie, obtains informed consent from the first patient), it is the 
responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that the followin g documents are available to Shire or 
its designee:
•Applicable local regulatory documentation (eg, completed FDA form 1572 [statement of 
Investigator]), signed, dated, and accurate
•Curricula vitae of investigator and sub -investigator(s) (current, dated and signed within 
24months of study  initiation)
•Copy  of investigator and sub- investigator(s) current medical license (indicating license 
number and expi[INVESTIGATOR_320])
•Signed and dated agreement of the final protocol

11.8 Data Monitoring Committee
There will be no data monitoring committee.
11.9 Protocol Violations/Deviations
The investigator w ill conduct the study  in compliance with the protocol. The protocol will not be 
initiated until the I RB/IEC and the appropriate regulatory  authorities have given 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Modifications to the protocol will not be made without agreement o f 
the Sponsor. Changes to the protocol will require written I RB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_67415], except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to patients. The I RB/IEC may  provide, if applicable regulator y authorities permit, 
expedited review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51704](s) in ongoing studies that 
have the approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I RB/IEC. The Sponsor will submit all protocol 
modifications to the regulatory  authorities in accord ance with the governing regulations.
A record of patients screened, but not entered into the study, is also to be maintained. No 
protocol exemption will be granted for this study .
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immed iate hazard(s) to 
patients, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_4885], if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action. An y departures from the protocol must be fully documented 
as a protocol deviation. Protocol deviations will need to be reviewed b y the medical monitor and 
may also be required to be submitted to the I RB/IEC.
Protocol modifications will only  be initiated by  [CONTACT_233935]/IEC and submitted to the FDA or other applicable internati onal regulatory  authority  before 
initiation.
11.10 Premature Closure of the Study
If the Sponsor, investigator, or regulatory  authorities discover conditions arising during the stud y 
which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacc eptable patient risk, 
the study  may  be terminated after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and the 
investigator(s). In addition, a decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue 
development of the investigational product may  be mad e at any  time. Conditions that may  
warrant termination of the study or site include, but are not limited to:
•The discovery  of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in 
the study
•Failure of the investigator to comply  with pertinent global regulations
•Submission of knowingly  false information from the study  site to the Sponsor or other 
pertinent regulatory  authorities
•Insufficient adherence b y the investigator to protocol requirements

Study drug infusions are to occur on approximately the same 
day of the week, but may occur every 14 days (± 3 7days) of the 
target day in order to facilitate patient scheduling. If at all 
possible, missed infusions should be avoided. If a patient is not 
dosed within 1721 days from their scheduled dose, the patient 
should receive the next infusion as soon as possible.Weight measurement will

Infusion 
Reactions and 
ManagementThe management of infusion -related reactions (IRRs) should be 
based on the severity of the reaction . Such managem ent may 
include, at the discretion of the investigator, eg, slow ing the 
infusion rate, treatment with medications such as antihistamines, 
antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_418732] .
In cases when required and at site’s discretion, additional 
clinical laboratory samples can be collected for further 
analysis of IRRs. Suggested laboratory evaluation includes 
complete blood count, com plete m etabolic panel including 
liver and renal function tests, CH50, C3, C4, C1 inhibitor,
C3a and C5a, total tryptase, histamine, immune complex 
and IgE levels.Added or modified text to

Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minim al 
treatm ent or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activi ties of daily living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or perm anent risk of harm  
to the research subject.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or

exposure of the patient to the investigational product; how ever, the 
determination of definitely related can only be used when recurrence 
of the event is observed.
The following additional guidance m ay be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the investigational product is com pelling 
and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to 
that product, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_11259]’s underlying medical condition, concomitant 
therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic 
relationship exists between the investigational product and 
the event.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Outcome 
CategorizationThe outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the st udy on the CRF. 
Outcom es are as follows:
•Fatal
•Not Recovered/Not Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
•Recovering/Resolving
•Unknown.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Symptoms of the 
Disease Under StudySymptoms of the disease under study should no t be classed as AEs as long as they 
are within the norm al day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease 
and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant 
worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Clinical Laboratory 
and Other Safety 
EvaluationsA change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG assessment can 
represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the 
investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an 
abnormal value, or a further worsening of an already abnormal value. When evaluating 
such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return 
to the refe rence range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment 
with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter 
within its reference range, must be taken into consideration.

start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return 
to within th e reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant disease) 
is found for the abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is 
clinically significant and whether it therefore represents an AE.

applicable follow -up reports) m ust also be sent to the/Shire Medical Monitor using 
the detail s specified in the emergency contact [CONTACT_418758].
The pregnant female study participant m ust be withdrawn from  the study.
Every effort should be made to gather inform ation regarding the pregnancy 
outcom e and condition of the infant . It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
obtain this information within [ADDRESS_528284] partum .
Pregnancy com plications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital
abnorm ality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical 
Study Serious Adverse Event and Non- serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_10191] . 
Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determ ines that the pregnancy m eets 
serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study 
Serious Adverse Event and Non -serious AEs Required by [CONTACT_418759]. The 
test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG test or ultrasound result will 
determine the pregnancy onset date.
Pregnancy and lactation are exclusion criteria for this study. Any report of pregnancy for 
a female study participant or the partner of a male study participant during the course of 
the study and through 30 days after the patient’s last dose of VPRIV must be reported to 
the Sponsor. Pregnancy is not to be reported as an AE; the Investigational and Marketed 
Products Pregnancy Report Form should be used to report the pregnancy. The pregnancy 
will be followed up through delivery or final outcome.

Section 7.16.3 Serious 
Adverse Event 
DefinitionAn SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death
•Is life threatening
•Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
•Requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
•A persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
•A congenital ano maly or birth defect
Important medical events that might not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical o r surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A life threatening AE 
is defined as an AE that placed the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred (ie, it does not i nclude an AE that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], which is the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for a pre
existing condition that has not w orsened after initiation of treatment, should no t result in 
an SAE designation. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral 
hernia repair w ould not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from 
a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_418735] t(s) serious 
criteria must be reported as SAEs. Furthermore, this does not apply to device failures 
resulting in scheduled surgical revisions, which should be reported as SAEs.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward m edical occurrence (whether 
consi dered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
•Results in death
•Is life -threatening. Note: The term  ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it was more severe.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or previously 
scheduled surgery for pre- existing conditions, which have not worsened after 
initiation of treatm ent, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an 
admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; however, c omplication(s) resulting from  a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_418736] m eet(s) 
serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

•Is a congenital abnorm ality/birth defect
•Isan important medical event. Note: Im portant medical events that m ay not 
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] m ay be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate m edical judgm ent, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may requir e medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcom es listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent 
in an emergency room  or at hom e; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the developm ent of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.

All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from  the time the 
subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in 
Section 8.[ADDRESS_528288] be reported to the Shire Global Pharm acovigilance and Risk 
Managem ent Department andthe CRO/Shire Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_528289] awareness of the event.

at the tim e of death, unless another study drug action was previously taken (eg, 
drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational 
product should be recorded as “dose not ch anged” or “not applicable” (if the 
subject never received investigational product). The study drug action of 
withdrawn should not be selected solely as a result of the subject’s death. 
Section 7.16.[ADDRESS_528294] promptly report all required information to the IRB/IEC. It is the 
responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that each investigator receives a copy of any 
CIOMS I/MedWatch report that has been submitted to the appropriate regulatory 
agencies notifying them of an unexpected related SAE. The investigator or Sponsor must 
ensure that the IRB/IEC receives a copy of the report and that a copy is also filed within 
their study files.
The sponsor or sponsor designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities /US central IRBs/EU central ECs of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition the sponsor or the sponsor’s designee is responsible for notifying active 
sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurri ng during all interventional studies 
across the velaglucerase alfa program .
The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant 
local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.
Section 7 .17Removal 
of Patients from the 
Trial or Investigational 
ProductA patient’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of 
the investigator. The follow ing m ay be justifiable reasons for the investigator to remove 
a patien t from the study:
•Non-compliance, including failure to appear at 1 or more study visits
•The patient w as erroneously included in the study
•The patient develops an exclusion criterion 
•The patient suffers an intolerable AE
•The patient requests to be disconti nued from the study
•The study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034]
•Pregnancy
The patient, the patient’s parent(s), or the patient’s legally authorized representative

Objectives:   
The primary objective i s to demonstrate efficacy  of the HDM SLIT -
tablet versus placebo as add- on treatment in children and 
adolescents (5- 17 years) with HDM allergic asthma based on 
clinically relevant asthma exacerbations after at least [ADDRESS_147562] one of the following criteria : 
• Doubling of ICS dose compared to background treatment  
• Systemic corticosteroids for treatment of asthma symptoms for at least 3 days  
• Emergency room visit due to asthma, requiring systemic 
corticosteroids  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130590] [ADDRESS_147563] to: 
• Nocturnal awakening due to asthma which require SABA 
rescue medication  
• Rescue medication use (SABA)  
• Lung function (FEV

Subjects will continue with their regular asthma background 
treatment. With the exception of additional sponsor provided ICS, 
which is optional, the subjects’ regular asthma rescue medi cation

Period [ADDRESS_147565]/parent/caregiver  in the eDiary. The reported symptoms will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_130653].  
 Period 4 is the efficacy assessment period. Period 4 lasts until the 
end of trial or discontinuation from IMP and during this period, the 
rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations will be evaluated from 1 September 2018  to 30 April 2020  (cohort 1) , 1 September 
2019 to 30 April 2021  (cohort 2) , 1 September 2020 to 30 April 
2022 ( cohort 3), and 1 September 2022 to 30 April 2024 (Cohort 
4). 
Subject s will be treated for 24-[ADDRESS_147566] one visit to the clinic where all the procedures of 11 are performed.  
Approximately e very 4 mon ths after randomisation, subjects or 
their parent/caregiver will be asked to complete the eDiary for a 
period of 14 days 3 weeks prior to V5 (at 4 months), V6 (at 8 
months), V7 (at 12 months), V8 (at 16 months), V9 (at 20 months), V10 (at 24 months)  and V1 1 (25 -30 months) . 
 
Subject safety precautions:  
All subjects will be provided with an Asthma Action Plan to provide 
guidance to effectively manage the subject's symptoms, and 
asthma rescue medication (OCS, SABA and a separate inhaler 
with ICS) .

the IMP treatment and should continue in the trial . 
Subjects will be provided with  a Local and Systemic Allergic 
Reaction Emergency Plan . In countries where it is a regulatory 
requirement, subjects will also be provided with an 
adrenaline/epi[INVESTIGATOR_130591]- injector.  
 
Trial  safety precautions:   
A sponsor independent data monitoring committee  (DMC ) will 
monitor the subjects’ safety data in an unblinded fashion. The 
DMC  Charter will specify the frequency of the DMC  meetings.  
Early trial termination may be the result of the criteria specified below:  
1. Treatment -related death of an individual;  
2. Treatment -related anaphylactic shock in at least 2 
subjects
2  defined as  acute onset of an illness (minutes to 
several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generali sed hives, pruritus, or flushing, 
swollen lips, tongue, or uvula) AND medically confirmed reduced blood pressure (BP) with associated symptoms of 
end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence). Low systolic BP for children is defined as less than 70 mmHg plus (2 x age) from 1 to 10 years, and 
less than 90 mmHg for 11 to 17 years of age.  
3. A substantial increase in the rat e of clinically relevant 
asthma exacerbations during period 3 defined by [CONTACT_130654]:  
a. the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations in the active treatment arm is at least 3 times higher than the expected background rate (≥3*1.4 = ≥4. 2 
exacerbations/subject/year) AND  
b. the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations in the active treatment arm is at least 3 times higher than the rate observed in the placebo arm  
The DMC will monitor the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations during period 3 to be able to pause the trial for safety review should a substantial increase in the active treatment arm compared to placebo occur.  
IMP intake may only be resumed after the information has been presented to health authorities, and health authorities concur with 
continued IMP intake. In case of complete premature IMP discontinuation, participating investigators , subjects , caregivers , 
 
2 The criterion for 2 events is based on prior trial experience where it has been observed that events of severe anaphylactic 
reactions unrelated to IMP may occur in allergic subjects even with a temporal relationship to tablet administration.

1 Introduction  
1.1 Disease background and current treatment modalities  
HDM allergy is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to allergens contained in HDM 
fragments and faeces. These particles are airborne and are therefore inhaled reaching  the 
human immune system primarily through the mucosal membrane of the airways, causing rhinitis  
and/or as thma (Arlian & Platts -Mills 2001) . Thus, HDM respi[INVESTIGATOR_130605] o 
main clinical manifestations: allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis  and allergic asthma (Bousquet 
et al. 2001) . 
HDM is an important allergen among children and adolescents. Among inhalant allergens, HDM 
sensitisation was found to be the most important risk factor for asthma development in children (Arshad et al. 2001; Lodge et al. 2011 ; Sears et al. 1989 ; Sporik et al. 1990 ; Terreehorst et 
al. 2002) . In addition to HDM sensitisation being linked to the develop ment of asthma in early 
childhood, it is also linked to chronic asthma, characterised by [CONTACT_130656]- aged children (Lau et al. 2000; Lodge et al. 2011 ) and persistence of asthma into 
adulthood (Illi et al. 2006 ). Patients sensitised to  HDM have a significantly higher risk of 
recurrent asthma exacerbations  (ten et al. 2005).  
Currently , treatment of allergic diseases is  based on allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy  and 
allergy immunotherapy ( AIT) (Bacharier et al. 2008; Bousquet et al. 2008; Bousquet et al. 
1998; GINA Executive Committee 2017; van Cauwenberge et al. 2000) . However, evidence 
show s that a llergen avoidance is not possible to an extent that relieves patients from their 
symptoms (Gotzsche & Johansen 2008; Valovirta et al. 2008) , and international treatment 
guidelines question whether the effect justifies the cost and effort (Brozek et al. 2010; GINA 
Executive Committee 2017) . 
Pharmacotherapy for HDM respi[INVESTIGATOR_130606] (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]), local corticosteroids (nasal and/or inhaled)  and inhaled β
2-agonist, depending on the 
clinical manifestation and severity. None of  the mentioned treatment options provide long- term, 
post-treatment benefits or alter the natural course of the allergic disease and m ost have effects 
in only one disease manifestation (i.e. AR or allergic asthma).  
The treatment algorithm in asthma is based on the concept of disease control, as described in 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute 2007 ) and the Global Initiative for Asthma ( GINA) 
guideline  (GINA Executive Committee 2017) where SLIT is recommended as an option for the 
treatment of adult HDM -sensitive patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis who have 
exacerbations despi[INVESTIGATOR_130607].  The goals of asthma management are to achieve good 
symptom control and to minimise future risk of exacerbations, as based on an expectation that 
when asthma is controlled, patients will experience no more than occasional recurrence of 
symptoms and exacerbations will be  rare. In paediatric  asthma, a seasonal fluctuation in the 
occurrence of asthma exacerbations  is well documented, with a rapid and substantial  increase 
in asthma- related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130608] (the ‘September 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]’) (GINA Executive Committee 2017; Sears 2008) . Evidence indicates that 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_130609] a causative role in this peak of asthma exacerbations 
(Sears 2008) , and treatment to improve asthma control is central  for reducing patients’ 
susceptibility towards virus -induced exacerbations (Busse et al. 2011).

Briefly, the asthma treatment algorithm defined by [CONTACT_130657] a 
combination of daily controller medications , with ICS as the preferred option, in combination 
with LABA upon increasing severity. A stepwise approach is recommended, with an increase in 
dose or addition of other controller options if the patient is not well -controlled, and a 
corresponding step- down adjustment if the patient has been controlled for a while. At all steps, 
break -through symptoms are treated with reliever  medication, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  a SABA.  
Thus, for patients with HDM allergic asthma, ICS  either dispensed alone or in combination with 
LABA  (combination products) are considered first -line treatment . While ICS  constitute the most 
effective anti -inflammatory medications for treatment of asthma  at the present time and provide 
disease control, ICS do not treat the underlying allergic disease and discontinu ation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_130610]  a recurrence in inflammation and asthma symptoms . For children [ADDRESS_147609] or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids, treatment with monoclonal antibodies, particularly Xolair,  is increasingly 
being used. Xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbations in these patients.  
AIT treats  the underlying immunologic al mechanisms responsible for allergic inflammation and 
represents  a treatment option for HDM allergy that is complementary to pharmacotherapy . AIT 
is performed by [CONTACT_130658].  
Considerations for initiating AIT include disease severity, lack of efficacy of pharmacotherapy, 
side effects of pharmacotherapy, patient preference and the presence of more than one manifestation of the underlying allergic disease  (Bousquet et al. 2008). 
1.2 Stage of development  
The HDM SLIT -tablet  is approved in the [LOCATION_002], Europe, Japan, and Australia as AIT for 
treatment of HDM respi[INVESTIGATOR_130611]. Additionally, it is  approved 
in Europe and Japan for treatment of  adolescents (12- 17 years) with HDM  AR. 
The HDM SLIT -tablet  is formulated as a fast-dissolving pharmaceutical formulation (oral 
lyophilisate)  containing standardised HDM allergen extract . Treatment involves once daily 
sublingual administration  and targets the underlying HDM allergy to provide clinical benefit in 
both HDM AR and HDM allergic asthma.  
To date, t he HDM SLIT -tablet has been investigated in 13 clinical trials and is  currently  being 
investigated in 1 ongoing trial  in the paediatric  population ( 5-17 years ). The completed trials 
comprised  5 phase I tri als, 2 phase II trials , and 6 phase III trials . This i ncluded 2 phase I trials 
conducted in children ( 5-14 years ) and adolescents (12- 17 years), respectively. In addition, 
adolescent subjects were included in 3 of the completed phase III efficacy trials.  
All trials were randomised, double- blind, placebo- controlled trials . Four  efficacy trials had a 
primary en dpoint related to HDM AR and 3 efficacy trials had a primary endpoint related to HDM 
allergic asthma. Safety was evaluated throughout the spectrum of the intended target population, i.e. subjects with persistent moderate- to-severe HDM AR despi[INVESTIGATOR_130612]/or with HDM allergic asthm a.

The MT -02 trial  investigated the efficacy and safety of the HDM SLIT -tablet in adolescents and 
adults (14 -74 years) with mild to moderate persistent HDM allergic asthma  and mild to severe 
HDM AR (Mosbech et a l. 2014 ). The results of the MT-02 trial demonstrated  that adding the 
HDM SLIT -tablet to ICS treatment for 1 year  allowed patients with mild to moderate HDM 
allergic asthma to reduce their ICS dose without affecting asthma control . 
The MT -04 trial  investigated the efficacy and safety of the HDM SLIT -tablet in adults (18- 65 
years) with HDM allergic asthma  and AR, a baseline ACQ score of 1.0- 1.5 and daily baseline 
ICS use corresponding to GINA steps 2 -3 (Virchow et al. 2016 ). The primary efficacy  analysis 
of the time to first asthma exacerbation showed a statistically significant reduced risk for [ADDRESS_147611] ratio of 0.69 (p=0.027). Thus, the MT -04 trial  
demonstrated that  for patients with HDM allergic asthma , adding the HDM SLIT -tablet to ICS 
treatment significantly reduced the risk of experiencing an asthma exacerbation. 
The TO-203-3-1 trial conducted in Japan  evaluated the efficacy and safety of the HDM SLIT -
tablet in adults with HDM allergic asthma with or w ithout HDM AR as assessed by a reduction in 
the risk of experiencing an asthma exacerbation.  This trial was not able to verify efficacy of the 
HDM SLIT -tablet in HDM allergic asthma . The TO -203-3- 1 trial design, endpoints, and 
population were modified from MT -04 to accommodate local requirements and treatment 
traditions.  
The approved adult dose of the HDM SLIT -tablet is 12 SQ -HDM. As pharmacodynamic effects 
of AIT products involve uptake by [CONTACT_130659] ( Bagnasco et al. 2005) , the doses of AIT used for adults and for  children ≥5 years of 
age are identical  (i.e. in dependent of age and body weight ) (Alvarez -Cuesta et al. 2006).  
During clinical development o f the HDM SLIT -tablet, a total of 810 p aediatric  subjects (<18 
years) have been included in the completed clinical trials , 283 of which were treated with the 12 
SQ-HDM dose.  The majority of p aediatric  subjects were adolescents.  
The safety profile of the HDM SLIT -tablet in children and adolescents was investigated in two 
phase I safety trials MT -03 (children 5- 14 years) and P008 (adolescents 12- 17 years) (Corzo et 
al. 2014; Maloney et al. 2016) . Results demonstrated safety profiles in children and 
adolescents that were similar to the safety profile observed for adult populations. Thus, in 
children (MT -03) and in adolescents (P008), the most frequently reported TEARs in active dose 
groups were mild to moderate local reactions in mouth and throat such as oral pruritus, throat 
irritation and mouth oedema. These events typi[INVESTIGATOR_130613] 1-[ADDRESS_147612] observed in adults. Also, across trials,  data stratified for age showed similar s afety 
profile s in adults ( ≥18 years) and adolescents (12- 17 years ).

1.3 Trial rationale  
The rationale behind the present  trial is to investigate whether add-on treatment with the HDM 
SLIT -tablet has an acceptable safety profile and can provide a relevant treatment benefit in 
terms of a reduced number  of asthma exacerbations for children and adolescent subjects  with 
HDM allergic asthma on low dose ICS plus LABA or medium/high dose ICS with or without  
LABA  and with HDM AR. Further , the trial will generate information on the  
 of the HDM SLIT -tablet.  
The trial population will include  children and adolescents (5-17 years of age)  with HDM allergic 
asthma on low dose ICS plus LABA or medium/high dose ICS with or without  LABA who are at 
risk of asthma exacerbations and who have  HDM AR. Eligible subjects have experienced 
asthma exacerbations in the last couple of  years . This population is identified as  patients with 
an unmet medical need. D espi[INVESTIGATOR_130614], these p aediatric  
patients continue to experience asthma exacerbations which may involve hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130615] 
a significant source of anxiety for patients as well as caregivers. In addition, a trial population 
with a history of frequent asthma exacerbations is in accordance with  the EMA guideline ( EMA 
2016b ). Finally,  the selected  population experiences rhinitis symptoms and/or a ne ed for rhinitis 
medication as a result  of their HDM allergic disease and treating the underlying immunologic al 
mechanisms responsible for allergic inflammation would thus provide relief from both 
manifestations of HDM  respi[INVESTIGATOR_130616].  
In this trial, subjects will be randomised (1:1) to treatment with the HDM SLIT -tablet (12 SQ -
HDM) or placebo in addition to their usual asthma background treatment and the asthma and 
rhinoconjunctivitis  rescue medication for a treatment period of approximately [ADDRESS_147614] on asthma exacerbations remains a relevant endpoint in paediatric patients (EMA 2016b; Reddel et al. 2009). In addition, data from the MT -04 trial demonstrated that in an 
adult trial population, the HDM SLIT -tablet was able to prevent asthma exacerbations when ICS 
was reduced ( Virchow et al. 2016). Similarly, while the present trial design does not evaluate 
efficacy during a period of reduction in asthma controller medication, the trial rationale is that for a paediatric population, adding the HDM SLIT -tablet to asthma controller medication will provide 
therapeutic benefit in the form of improved asthma control and a reduced susceptibility towards asthma exacerbations . 
1.4 Benefit -risk assessments and ethical considerations  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_130617]- based 
therapy, approximately 50% of adult US asthma patients have inadequately controlled asthma (CDC 2015 ). Patients with unstable severe asthma suffer from limited control of symptoms, 
frequent exacerbatio ns, and compromised quality of life. Exacerbations are particularly disabling 
for the patient and typi[INVESTIGATOR_130618]. A proportion of these patients with inadequately c ontrolled 
asthma who require emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130619] a 
substantial amount of the cost burden associated with asthma treatment. Treatments that can reduce the risk of future asthma exacerbations and improve measures of current impairment address a major unmet need in asthma management in North America  and Europe today.

IND: [ADDRESS_147616] important risk factor for 
asthma development in children (Arshad et al. 2001; Lodge et al. 2011 ; Sears et al. 1989; 
Sporik et al. 1990 ; Terreehorst et al. 2002). T reatment with the HDM SLIT -tablet targets the 
underlying HDM allerg y to provide clinical benefit in both HDM allergic asthma and HDM AR. 
Thus, in the present trial, subjects in the active treatment group may experience treatment benefits in terms of improved asthma symptom control and a reduced number  of asthma 
exacerbati ons, as well as a reduced burden of symptoms related to HDM AR. 
When developi[INVESTIGATOR_130620] -tablet, the  sublingual route was selected over subcutaneous 
injection to provide a product with a safety profile allowing for at -home administration. This 
results in improved convenience for patients and caregivers  to those who have a fear of 
injections or who cannot set aside time off work or school for frequent doctor’s visits over a 
treatment period of several years. In addition, orodispersible dosage forms hold great promise 
for children as they are easy to administer, do not require additional water and, as long as dispersion is rapid, are difficult to spit out (EMEA 2006 ). 
The most prevalent AEs observed with the HDM SLIT -tablet  include  local reactions in the mouth 
and throat (e.g. oral pruritus, throat irritation, and  mouth oedema ) of mild to moderate severity . 
The risk of severe swelling is low and no AEs have involved local allergic swelling that 
compromised  the airways  in completed clinical trials . The risk of severe  systemic allergic 
reactions  is considered minimised for the HDM SLIT -tablet , as sublingual administration has not 
been found to result in relevant  absorption into the systemic circulation.  
This clinical trial will follow the principles of the Helsinki Declaration 1964 and subsequent  
amendments and clarifications  (World Medical Association 2013 ). The trial will be approved 
by [CONTACT_130660] (IEC)/institutional review board (IRB) and health 
authorities before initiation.  
A placebo group will be used as a control -group in the trial. An active comparator is not included 
in the trial as there are no available authorised HDM SLIT -tablets . A placebo group is 
considered ethically justifiable since subjects in both treatment groups will be provided with 
background treatment and rescue medication  to treat their asthma and rhinitis symptoms during 
the trial . Furthermore, subjects will be medically monitored during the trial and provided with 
appropriate treatment if warranted.  Finally, subjects can withdraw from the trial at any time if 
they find the treatment intolerable or without giving reason.  
The population selected for this trial is characteri sed by a history of asthma exacerbations 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_130621], which means the future risk of exacerbations in these subjects is considerable. In order to minimis e the risk relating to severe asthma exacerbations, the trial 
protocol specifies that subjects who experience severe asthma exacerbations be treated 
appropriately, and a maximum number of severe asthma exacerbations allowed in any single subject has been defined, after which a subject must be discontinued from the IMP treatment . 
In order to minimise any risk related to the trial activities, the  following tools have been 
incorporated in the protocol:  
- Each subject  will be provided with self -monitoring tools in the form of a preprogrammed 
eDiary and a peak flow meter  to increase awareness of  asthma control

- Each subject will be provided with a pocket -size patient card containing investigator 
contact  [CONTACT_3031]  
- An independent DMC will be established for safety monitoring of the trial  
- Considerations regarding COVID -19 pandemic:  
o Regarding the pandemic of COVID -19, it is important to highlight that subjects' 
safety is always first priority. Participating in this trial, including receiving 
treatment with AIT, is not expected to increase s ubjects’ risk of contracting 
communicable diseases, including COVID -19. If regional circumstances related 
to COVID -[ADDRESS_147619] frequent  adverse reactions. Additional details regarding specific benefits 
and risks for subjects participating in this  clinical trial may be found in the accompanying IB and

In conclusion, the risks and benefits of trial participation are considered to be well balanced.

3.3 Discussion of design  
The selected design for the present trial is based on the EMA  The Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use  (CHMP) guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products  for 
the treatment of asthma  (EMA 2016b ) and incorporates the recommendations of the EMEA 
CHMP guideline on the clinical development of products for specific immunotherapy for the 
treatment of allergic diseases (EMA 2008), the needs stated in the World Health Organisation 
(WHO ) position paper on aller gen immunotherapy for development of sublingual 
immunotherapy (Bousquet et al. 1998), the EMA/PDCO Standard Paediatric Investigation Plan 
for Allergen Product s for Specific Immunotherapy (EMA & PDCO 2015 ), and the  Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA) guidance for industry on the content and format for p aediatric us e 
supplements  (FDA 1996 ). 
The clinical efficacy endpoint has been chosen based on the guidelines referenced above as 
well as the joint statement on endpoints for clinical asthma trials and clinical practice from the 
American Thoracic Society and the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (Reddel et al. 2009). The 
trial design is also based on the experience from previous ALK trials with allergy 
immunotherapy in general and with the HDM SLIT -tablet in particular  for treatment of allergic 
asthma and rhinitis . 
The trial population c omprises children (5- 11 years) and adolescents (12- 17 years) with a 
clinical history cons istent with HDM allergic asthma  who are at risk of asthma exacerbations  
despi[INVESTIGATOR_130624]/high dose ICS with or

Trial ID : MT-[ADDRESS_147637]:  2016 -004363 -39 
IND: [ADDRESS_147638] 4 months of treatment initiation and maintenance. 
The duration of the treatment  initiation and maintenance period is based on the results from 
previous trials with the HDM SLI T-tablet for treatment of asthma and rhinitis symptoms (Demoly 
et al. 2016; Mosbech et al. 2014; Virchow et al. 2016) where onset of significant effect was 
seen after approximately [ADDRESS_147639] more symptoms  (Bousquet et al. 2008). 
Efficacy measurement  duration will be  approximately 20 months  in order to capture two autumn 
and winter seasons . This means that the efficacy assessment period will start 1 September for 
all subjects.   
 Safety endpoints  include AEs, vital signs and laboratory values that are normally used in 
characterising the safety profile of an IMP.  
 The active dosage chosen in the trial is 12 SQ-HDM, which is the approved dose for adults in 
the [LOCATION_002],  Europe and Australia and for adolescents (12- 17 years) in Europ e. The dose 
is based on the appropriate dose established in adults  as the dose providing the highest 
efficacy with the fastest onset of effect  and with a safety profile that supports daily at -home 
administration  (Demoly et al. 2016; Nolte et al. 2015; Virchow et al. 2016) . This dose (12 SQ -
HDM)  will constitute the relevant dose for all populations ≥5 years of age, in accordance with 
the general practice for AIT (Alvarez -Cuesta et al. 2006 ). 
 
Besides treatment wit h IMP, the subjects will use  background treatment with low dose ICS plus 
LABA or medium/high dose ICS with or without  LABA . Throughout the trial t he ICS or ICS  and 
LABA combination treatment will be at the same dose as when the subjects enter  the trial . 
LABA treatment when not being used in combination with ICS is not allowed as it is no longer 
recommended  as an option for add- on treatment at any step of therapy unless used in 
combination (GINA Executive Committee 2017). A separate inhaler with ICS al one will be 
allowed as  asthma rescue medi cation  in case of deterioration of symptoms or  following a severe 
exacerbation. Alternatively, subjects can double the dose of their background ICS for an 
exacerbation rather than using sponsor provided ICS.  SABA and OCS will also be provided as 
asthma rescue medication. Please note that the terms “background treatment” and “rescue 
medication” follows the EMA “Definition of IMPs and use of AMPs consultation document” from 
2016 (EMA 2016a ) rather than the EMA “Guideline on the c linical development of products for 
specific  immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic diseases” from 2008 ( EMA 2008 ).  
Asthma exacerbations constitute the greatest unmet  medical need  for patients, are a caus e of 
anxiety to patients and their families, result ing in the greatest stress on health care providers, 
and generate the greatest cost to the health care system (Lane et al. 2006). The e xacerbation 
rate is a clinically relevant endpoint to assess treatment effect in patients with asthma (EMA 
2016b ). Hence, the primary endpoint in this trial is the rate of exacerbations.  
The definition of a clinically relevant asthma exacerbation used in this trial is based on the 
recommendations given in the joint statement from the American Thoracic Society and the 
Confidential   Clinical Trial Protocol

European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] 2009 ( Reddel et al. 2009) and recommendations from GINA  
(GINA Executive Committee 2017). 
If the subject experiences one of the following events, this will be characterised as a clinically  
relevant  asthma exacerbat ion: 
• Doubling of ICS dose compared to background treatment  
• Systemic corticosteroids for treatment of asthma symptoms for at least 3 days  
• Emergency room visit due to asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130590] [ADDRESS_147641] of:    
• Proportion of days with nocturnal awakenings due to asthma requiring SABA rescue 
medication during the 14 days eDiary recording every 4 months after randomisation  
• The average daily dose of SABA during the 14 days eDiary recording every 4 months 
after randomisation  
• Percen tage predicted FEV [ADDRESS_147642] on asthma symptoms, asthma 
medication use and lung function.  
 The expected rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations is 1.4 (Lanier et al. 2009)
 in this 
trial. A 20% reduction in the rate corresponds to an absolute reduction of  0.[ADDRESS_147643] per year.  This can further be translated to saving 1 clinically 
relevant  asthma exacerbation per year per 3.6 treated subjects. It has been proposed that any 
reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations (e.g., requiring treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids) is clinically relevant (Glacy et al. 2013). 
 
This trial is a randomised, parallel -group, double -blind, placebo- controlled multi -national trial. 
Randomisation introduces a deliberate element of chance into the assignment of treatments to 
subjects in a clinical trial. During subsequent analysis of the trial data, it provides a sound 
statistical basis for the quantitative evaluation of the evidence relating to treatment effects. It also tends to produce treatment groups in which the distributions of prognostic factors, known 
and unknown, are similar. In combination with blinding, randomisation helps to avoid possible 
bias in the selection and allocation of subjects arising from the predictability of treatment assignments ( ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 1998 ). It is desirable for statistical 
purposes to compare groups of equal size and therefore the randomisation procedure is planned as a 1:[ADDRESS_147644].

he/she has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time without prejudice. Where 
discontinuation from the trial is initiated by [CONTACT_423], the investigator is to ascertain the 
primary reason for discontinuation from the list below:  
• An AE for which the investigator did not consider discontinuation from the trial necessary  
• Perceived insufficient therapeutic effec t 
• Co-existing disease  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Other reasons  
Additionally,  the subject may  at any time be discontinued  from the trial at the discretion of the

with the recom mendation of EMA/PDCO standard p aediatric investigation plan for allergen 
products for specific i mmunotherapy  (EMA & PDCO 2015 ). No other  stratification will be used in 
this trial. 
When a subject is randomised a unique num ber is assigned for the first dispensing of IMP . 
6.[ADDRESS_147668] will contain trial site information (including direct telephone number) to be utilised in the 
event of an emergency.  
6.4 Treatment blinding/unblinding  
A double -blind set -up will be used. The HDM SLIT -tablet and the matching placebo will be 
similar in appearance and taste and will be packaged identically to maintain the treatment blind. 
Neither the sponsor, the subject, nor the trial site staff will know which treatment the subject is receiving. DMC  members will be unblinded to tr eatment.  
The randomisation code for a particular subject can be broken in a medical emergency if knowledge of the IMP is necessary for the optimal treatment of the subject. If possible the trial site must contact [CONTACT_130665]'s treatment. However, in case of an 
emergency necessitating the knowledge of the IMP, unblinding and appropriate treatment 
should be the very first action by [CONTACT_779].  
The randomisation code breaking will be performed via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) 
for this trial. The time, date and reason for unblinding as well as the initials of the person 
breaking the r andomisation code  must be recorded.  
The I RT will notify the clinical research associate ( CRA ) and the safety department at the 
sponsor immediately after the randomisation code is broken.  
The subject must  be discontinued from the trial after randomisation  code breaking.  
It may also be necessary to unblind an individual subject’s treatment by [CONTACT_456]/safety department, for the purposes of expedited reporting to the authorities and/or ethics committees 
(e.g. in case of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R)). In that situation, 
blinding of other sponsor personnel should  be maintained during the trial.

All parents/caregivers  must provide informed  consent in accordance with the origins of the 
Declaration of Helsink i (World Medical Association 2013) and the applicable laws of the 
country. The written informed consent must be obtained before any trial activities are 
performed, incl uding any period for wash- out of concomitant medication. 
If the minor can understand the risks and benefits of the trial, he/she should also be informed 
and, if capable, provide written assent.  Assent should be obtained according to national 
requirements.  Subjects turning [ADDRESS_147683] sign the adult informed consent 
form.  
It is the responsibility of the principal investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a sub- investigator to obtain the written 
informed consent/assent from the parents/ caregivers  and subject, respectively.  
The investigator must explain the nature of the trial, its purpose, the procedures involved, the 
expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail and 
provide the subject with a copy of the information sheet and the consent form.  Information to the 
parent/caregiver  and subject can be delegated to a nurse, but the investigator must be available 
for questions and both the nurse and the investigator must sign the consent form to document this. 
The parent/ caregiver  and subject must be given sufficient time to consider the trial before 
deciding whether to participate. Each subject must be informed that participation in the trial is 
voluntary, that he/she may withdraw from the trial at any time and that withdrawal of 
consent/assent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the 
treating physician.  
The informed consent/assent  form must  be signed and dated before the subject enters the trial 
(i.e. before any trial related activity). The investigator must give a copy of the signed informed consent/assent  to the parent/ caregiver  and subject. The i nvestigator should keep the original.  
If information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continued 
partic ipation in the trial  the subject information sheet will be updated by [CONTACT_130679]/IRB and the Competent authorities. The parent/ caregiver  and subject must be inform ed

11.8 Vital sign s 
Vital signs will include measurement of BP and heart rate in a seated position (after ≥ 5 minutes 
of seated inactivity).  
11.9 Lung function  
The assessment of the lung function will  include measurements of forced  vital capacity (FVC), 
and FVC percent predicted, FEV [ADDRESS_147694] value will be entered in the eCRF. 
The predicted FVC and FEV 1 will be based on the Quanjer equation  (Quanjer et al. 1995). If 
the subject self -reports his/her race as Black, appropriate adjustments will automatically be 
made for race by [CONTACT_130680][INVESTIGATOR_130637]:

To confirm the diagnosis of allergy against HDM, blood samples will be drawn at the screening 
visit for determination of specific IgE against D. pteronyssinus  and D. farinae. Additionally, the 
blood samples will be analysed for  and specific IgE a gainst Blattella germanica 
(cochroach) and Cladosporium herbarum  (mold). 
These samples will be analysed together with the samples for the safety laboratory assessments (see above), and the results will be reported to sites for assessment of subject eligibility.  
Immunology:  
To assess the immunological response of the treatment, blood samples will be drawn for determination of antigen- specific antibodies (e.g. IgE and IgG

based. Thus, as the complex interactions between allergy immunotherapy, rhinoconjunctivitis  
and asthma are currently not characterised to a level that translates to a meaningful clinical 
advantage, individual results from the exploratory biomarker analyses will not be given to the 
subjects. For the same reasons, individual results will not be added to the subjects’  medical

Blood sample for pharmacogenetics  
This blood sample will only be drawn if the subject has a body weight of more than 20 kg and 
consents to long term  storage of a DNA sample.  
DNA and RNA material will be extracted from the blood sample at a central laboratory selected 
by [CONTACT_87379]. If pharmacogenetic sampling is accepted , two 2.5 mL blood samples will be drawn.  The 
blood sample will be drawn at visits 3 and 11 where blood sampling already is planned. The

11.23.1  eDiary assessments  
During the trial , the subjects and/or their parent/caregiver will complete an e Diary. The e Diary is 
a hand -held electronic device  that will be issued to the subjects before the start of the baseline  
period (period 2) . 
The following items  will be outlined in the  eDiary at pre -specified intervals during the trial : 
• Asthma symptoms  and VAS  
o Nocturnal awakenings due to asthma requiring SABA  
• Use of asthma  rescue  medication  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms  and VAS  
• Use of rhinoconjunctivitis medication  
• Specific symptoms identified as local effect of sublingual immunotherapy, see Section 
12.3, for capturing solicited AEs  
The eDiary is to be completed by [CONTACT_423]/parent/caregiver for 21 days between baseline 
(V2) and randomisation visit (V3). After randomisation, the eDiary is to be completed for [ADDRESS_147712] regular visit s and at all 
unscheduled visits. Subjects aged ≥11 years will self -complete the questionnaire when possible. 
An interviewer administered version will be used to subjects aged 5-10 years . The ACQ -IA will 
be use d for all subjects aged 5 to 10 years of age although it is only validated for children from 6 
years of age. However, since this is a two year trial, all 5 year old children will be 7 years of age 
at the end of the trial . 
 
ACQ -IA 
The ACQ -IA questionnaire w ill be completed by [CONTACT_130690] 5 to 10  years during the trial. 
Questions will be administered by a trained interviewer. The questionnaire contains five scoring 
symptoms, one question about SABA medication use and another about FEV 1, the latter being 
completed by [CONTACT_46683]. Subjects  are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 
7 days and respond to each question using a 7- point scale. The items are equally weighted and 
the ACQ -IA score is the mean of the 7 items and therefore between 0 (well controlled) and 6 
(extremely poorly controlled).  
Derivation of answers and the scales used has been provided in Appendix 5.

 An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, whether or not considered related to the trial product.  
 
The following  events should not be recorded as AEs:  
• A pre-planned procedure, e.g.  a surgical intervention, unless the condition for which the 
procedure was planned has worsened since the informed consent form was signed. 
• Pre-existing conditions documented as medical history. However, any worsening in 
severity or frequency of a pre- existing condition during the clinical trial period must be 
regarded as an AE. 
Serious adverse event  
A SAE is any untoward  medical occurrence or  effect that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe)

Selected AEs (non-serious or serious) will be considered events of special  interest (E SI). ESIs 
are events that are considered critical for the evaluation of the product’ s safety profile and/or  for 
which additional data will be collected.  Events of speci al interest for this trial are:  
• Severe asthma exacerbations and clinically relevant asthma exacerbations (as defined 
in Table of definitions ) 
• Anaphylactic reactions, anaphylaxis60 and/or systemic allergic reactions  
• Events treated with adrenaline/epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  
• Severe local swelling or oedema of the mouth and/or throat  
• Eosinophilic oesophagitis  
Severe and clinical ly relevant asthma exacerbations reported during the trial are expected as a 
result of subjects’ background disease and will be collected in the eCRF as ESIs  throughout the 
trial in order to get detailed information related to the primary efficacy endpoint. Severe and clinically relevant asthma exacerbations will not be considered a safety endpoint unless an exacerbation fulfils the criteria for an SAE. Severe and clinically relevant asthma exacerbations 
reported during periods 3 and 4 will be summarised as  part of the efficacy results in the 
integrated clinical trial report (ICTR).  
Medication errors, including overdose, abuse and misuse of the IMP  
The definition of an AE also covers medication errors and use of the IMP outside what is 
foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product
. If doses higher than the 
recommended dose are taken, whether intentionally or unintentionally, the risk of AEs may 
increase. This includes the risk of systemic allergic reactions or severe local reactions.  
• Overdose: Any cumulative dose taken in one day that exceeds the dose intended by [CONTACT_47375], regardless of whether the dose has caused any AEs  
 
60 The definition of anaphylaxis (Sampson et al. 2006) includes any 1 of the following 3 criteria:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, 
or both (e.g., generalised hives, pruritus, or flushing, or swollen lips, togue, or uvula) AND either 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF,

2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for the subject 
(minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g., generalised hives, itch-flush, swollen lips, tongue, or uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)

d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for the subject (minutes to several hours): low

12.2 Assessments  
Severity  
The sever ity of an AE is  a clinical observation assessed by [CONTACT_130691]:  
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subj ect’s daily activities, unacceptable  
Causal relationship to IMP  
The causal relationship between an (S)AE and the IMP is assessed by [CONTACT_130692]:  
• Possible: A reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the ev ent and the 
IMP. 
• Unlikely: The event is most likely caused by  a different aetiology than the IMP  
For SAEs assessed as unlikely related to IMP, the most likely alternative aetiology should be provided.  
Outcome  
The outcome of an (S)AE is assessed by [CONTACT_130693]:  
• Recovered:  Fully recovered or the condition has returned to baseline  
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE the subject suffered persistent disability/incapacity . If the sequela qualifies as a SAE, the AE m ust be reported as such 
• Not recovered: The condition has not returned to baseline however, symptoms may have improved  
• Fatal: Event that results in death  
• Unknown: The outcome  is unknown. This term should only be used when no other 
definition is possible e.g . the subject is lost to follow -up

also be filled in.  
If the same type of AE occurs more than 1 day in a row with the same pattern (e.g. itching in the 
mouth for 5- 10 minutes after intake of IMP) it is considered a recurrent AE. The AE form should 
be filled in with the start date and the description. Once the AE no longer reccur s after IMP 
intake, the AE form should be completed with a stop date. If the AE then re- appears on a 
subsequent day, a new  AE form should be filled in.  
The investigator should record the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available the 
investigator should record each sign and symptom as indivi dual AEs.  Further , the diagnosis of 
the underlying disease  should be report ed instead of a procedure performed due to the disease 
(e.g. if a subject undergoes surgery due to appendicitis, appendicitis , and not the surgery 
performed, should be reported as the AE ). 
Solicited Adverse Events  
The eDiary  will be used  to capture 15 specific  symptoms , identified as local side effects of 
sublingual immunotherapy  (Passalacqua et al. 2013 ). These local side effects  will be collected 
on a daily basis by [CONTACT_130694] 28 days of treatment  (Section 11.21) . The eDiary 
is to be completed by [CONTACT_423]/parent/ caregiver.  Subjects or their parent/caregiver will be 
trained by [CONTACT_130695] 3 on the proper method to complete the eDiary . 
The reported symptoms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_130696] . 
The duration in minutes of the solicited AEs occurring on Day 1 (visit 3) will be collected. The 
AE start and stop time of solicited  AEs that occur on Day [ADDRESS_147721] based on a clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_130641] . At each visit, subjects/caregivers will be asked whether 
any of the following has occurred since the last clinic visit:

defect /developmental delay , the event must be reported and followed up as an SAE. 
Any abnormalities observed in a child (up to two years of age) and suspected to be related to intra-uterine exposure to the IMP should be reported to ALK.  
13 Early termination  of trial  
ALK reserves the right to terminate the trial under the following condit ions:  
- Safety concerns  
- Recommendation by [CONTACT_1363]  
- Proven lack of efficacy from other completed trials with the same IMP  
If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the investigator should promptly inform the 
subjects an d ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. Furthermore, the investigator and/or 
ALK should promptly inform the independent ethics committee/institutional review boards 
(IEC/IRBs ) and provide a detailed written explanation. The regulatory authorities should be 
informed according to national regulations.  
Early trial termination may be the result of any single  criteria specified below : 
1. IMP-related death of an individual  
2. IMP-related anaphylactic shock in at least 2 subjects61 defined as:  
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal  tissue, or both (e.g., generali sed hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips, 
tongue, or uvula)  AND medically confirmed r educed BP with associated symptoms of 
end-organ dysfunction ( e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence).  
 
61 The criterion for 2 events is based on prior trial experience where it has been observed that events of severe anaphylactic 
reactions unrelated to IMP may occur in allergic subjects even with a temporal relationship to tablet administration.

a. The DMC will monitor the rate of cl inically releva nt asthma exacerbations during 
period 3 to be able to pause the trial for safety review should a substantial 
increase in the active treatment arm compared to placebo occur.  A substantial 
increase in the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations during period 3 
defined by [CONTACT_130654]:  
i. the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations in the active treatment 
arm is at least 3 times higher than the expected background rate (≥3*1.4 = ≥4.2 exacerbations/subject/year) AND  
ii. the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations in the active treatment arm is at least 3 times higher than the rate observed in the placebo arm  
The DMC will monitor the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations during period 3 
to be able to pause the trial for safety review should a substantial increase in the active 
treatment arm compared to placebo occur.  
IMP intake may only be resumed after the information has been presented to health authorities, 
and health authorities concur with continued IMP intake. In case of complete premature IMP 
discontinuation , participating investigators/subjects/parent/ caregiver , the IRB/IEC, and the 
relevant health authorities will be promptly informed.  
14 Data handling 
The diary in the trial will be an eDiary. The site will be trained in the use of eDiary by [CONTACT_3187]. The sites will then train the subjects and/or their parent/caregiver in how to fill 
in the eDiary.  
An eCRF  will be used for this trial. The  data is entered by [CONTACT_130700]/staff into the 
eCRF according to guidelines.  A completed eCRF is required for each subject who signs an 
informed consent. All eCRFs must be completed in English.  
The completed eCRFs and eDiaries are the propert y of the sponsor and must not be made 
available in any form to third parties (except for authorised representatives of appropriate

Starting with the baseline  phase (i.e. V2) an eDiary will be dispensed and diary data will be 
entered by [CONTACT_423]. Subjects and/or their parent/caregiver will be trained in the eDiary by [CONTACT_1275]. In addition, a video wi th information on the eDiary will be available for the subjects  
and their parent/caregiver .The eDiary  data will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_093].  
During the trial, diary data will be entered in an eDiary by [CONTACT_3184]/or their 
parent/caregiver and transferred to the vendor database on a daily basis. The 
investigator /designee  should check subject compliance on an ongoing basis (weekly  within the 
baseline period). If the subject has missed more than 2 days in a row or the total compliance for 
a period is  less than 80% the investigator should contact [CONTACT_423]. The aim is for the overall 
compliance for a subject in the trial not to be below 80%.  
There will be no other source documentation for these data than the vendor database.  
Once all eDiary data has been collected, the diary database will be closed and transferred from the vendor to ALK. The investigator will also be provided with an electronic copy of the diary 
data collected at the specific site at the latest [ADDRESS_147734] to periodic review by [CONTACT_456] . Findings during the review of the

14.5 Database lock  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be 
locked , access for CRAs and non- sponsor staff/persons will be revoked and data may be 
unblinded.  
If changes to trial data become necessary after database lock this must be performed according 
to the current ALK standard operating procedures  (SOP ). 
A data archive for the site subject data files are produced and sent to the s ite. 
The investigator must sign and date the data archive approval form and send it back to the sponsor.  
15 Statistical methods  
Statistical analyses will be carried out by [CONTACT_130703].  
If nothing else is mentioned, all the statistical tests described in this section use a significance level of 5% and all tests and confidence intervals are two- sided. The null hypothesis is the  
hypothesis of no difference and the alternative to the null hypothesis is the hypothesis of  a 
difference.  
Descriptive stat istics for numerical variables includes summary tables displaying mean, SD,  
median, 5% -quantile, 25% -quantile, 75% -quantile, 95% -quantile, minimum and maximum.  
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables includes frequencies tables that display numbers  
and percentage.  
Before database lock, a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) detailing the specifications 
given below will be prepared and agreed upon.  
Any changes in the statistical methods compared to the final SAP will be documented in the ICTR. Post -hoc analyses, if any, will be clearly marked. 
15.1 Sample size and power considerations  
The primary endpoint is the annualised rate of clinically relevant  asthma exacerbations during 
the efficacy evaluation period  (period 4) . The  rate of clinically re levant  asthma exacerbation s will 
be analysed using a negative binomial  regression model.  
From  (Lanier et al. 2009) the rate of clinically relevant  asthma exacerbations is expected to be 
approximately 1.[ADDRESS_147737] (~ 0.64*52/24 
=1.[ADDRESS_147738] per year) . 
Power calculation are both performed based on the negative binomial distribution assuming 
overdispersion and based on  the poisson distribution when assuming no overdispersion . 
Overdisper sion means that some subjects will tend to have more exacerbations than others.  
The dispersion parameter in the negative binominal distribution is assumed to be k=0.7 (Pavord 
et al. 2012) . When there is no overdisper sion (k->0) the negative binominal distri bution will 
become a poisson distribution.

If assuming a drop -out rate of 30%, a power of at least 90%  and an efficacy assessment period 
of 20 month (86 weeks) , a sample size of approximately  300 (~205/0. 7=293 ) subjects per arm 
should be sufficient to detect a difference in exacerbation rates of 20%  when no overdispersion 
is present  as shown in Table 13. In case of overdispersion defined by a dispersion parameter of 
k=0.7, a sample size of 300 (>202/0. 7=288) subjects p er arm would be sufficient to detect a 
difference in the exacerbation rates of 30%.  
15.[ADDRESS_147741] b linded sample size reassessment with data cuf off point 1 Feb 2020  
A blinded sample size reasses sment (SSR) will be perform ed. In case of a potentially 
insufficiently powered trial with respect to the primary efficacy analysis of clinically relevant 
asthma exacerbations, the sample size will be increased accordingly from the planned 600 
subjects (=300 per treatment arm) up to a total maximum of 900 randomised subjects (=450 per treatment arm).

rate (𝜇𝜇̂𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡) for both treatment groups, an overall overdispersion parameter ( 𝑘𝑘�𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡) and the 
overall drop- out rate. 𝜇𝜇̂𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 and 𝑘𝑘�𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 will be estimated using a negative binominal regression 
model. Each subject will be included in the analysis with the time in years from start of period [ADDRESS_147745] 
discontinued prior to period 4 divided by  [CONTACT_130704].  
Cohort 1 will be used to calculate the average time for efficacy asses sment for subjects that 
continue into period 4 according to the expression:

𝑖𝑖=1∗608
𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝4 
where 𝜏𝜏̂𝑝𝑝4 is the average time in days with efficacy assessment of the primary endpoint for 
subjects who continue into period 4, 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 is the time in days in period [ADDRESS_147746] i, 𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is the number of IMP discontinuations in period 4 and 𝑁𝑁𝑝𝑝4 is 
the number of subjects who continue into period 4 , and 608 days corresponds to the 20 months 
of efficacy assessment for subjects who complete the trial . The expression do es not account for 
IMP discontinuations after the cut off point of approximately  17 month s of efficacy assess ment  
due to lack of data beyond this  time point  for sample size reassessment. Thus , it is assumed 
that no subjects will discontinue after approximately  17 month s of efficacy assessment . 
Power/sample size estimation can be reassessed using a rewriting of the closed formula presented in Section 15.1

The flow chart for the SSR is illustrated in Figure 2 below.  
A relative decrease in the clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate of 30% (RR=0.7) of

The upper limit for power is set to 85%. If the reassessed power for the planned 600 subjects is equal to or above 85%, no additional subjects will be randomized.   
The lower limit for power is set to 70%. If the maximum sample size limit of 900 subjects does not result in a power of 70% or greater, no additional subjects will be randomized. That is, the trial will continue with the planned 600 subjects.  
If the reassessed power for the planned 600 subjects is below 85% and the reassessed power for the m aximum of 900 subjects is above 70%, additional subjects will be randomised until a

15.8 Efficacy analyses  
Derivation of the primary efficacy endpoint  
Clinically relevant asthma exacerbation endpoint  
The source for deriving the clinically relevant asthma exacerbation endpoints is the AE form of 
the eCRF. On the AE form the clinically relevant asthma exacerbations are reported with an AE 
number, a start and a stop time/date and the criterion/criteria’s  fulfilled for the event being 
categorised as a clinically relevant asthma exacerbation (section 2.5) .  
A c
linically relevant asthma exacerbation must be separated by >7 days from a previous 
clinically relevant asthma exacerbation in order to be considered an individual event. I.e. the 
difference between the start date of an event (i) and the stop date for the previous event  (i-1) 
must be more than 7 days :

Annualised rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations in period 4  
The efficacy assessment period (period 4) begins on the [ADDRESS_147755] day of

Primary efficacy analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on all subjects in FAS with observations of the primary endpoint.  The primary endpoint will be analysed by [CONTACT_3553] a negative binominal (NB) 
regression model with the number of asthma exacerbations as the response variable, t reatment 
group, age group ( <12 years/≥ 12 years)  and country as fixed factors  and the logarithm of the 
duration time in  years in  period 4 as an offset value.  The between treatment group comparison 
will be performed using a Log  Likelihood Ratio (LR) test derived from the NB regression 
analysis.
 The null hypothesis is that the rate of clinically releva nt asthma exacerbations is equal 
for the active group and the placebo group. The alternative hypothesis is that the rate of 
clinically relevant  asthma exacerbations is different for the active group and the placebo group.  
The primary outcome is the resulti ng p-value from the LR test reported together with the ratio of 
the rates and Wald 95% confidence intervals.  The result of the primary efficacy analysis is 
considered succes sful when the p- value is below 0.05.

If the NB regression model  fails to  converge a poisson regression model with an overdispersion 
parameter will instead be applied for the primary efficacy analysis  with the same covariates and 
offset as for the NB regression. If this model also fails to converge the poisson regression model 
without overdispersion will be used for the primary efficacy analysis .  
As a supportive analysis the primary efficacy en dpoint will be analysed based on the PP 
analysis set using the same NB regression model as for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Sensitivity analyses with respect to missing data of the primary efficacy endpoint are described 
in section 15.13. 
Key secondary and secondary efficacy analysis  
The key secondary and secondary efficacy analys es will be based on all subjects in FAS with

The proportion o f days  with nocturn al awakening which require SABA use over the t wo weeks 
diary assessment period (before V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10  and V11) will be analysed by [CONTACT_101485] a generalised linear mixed effect model (GLMM) with a logit link funct ion. Treatment, visit , 
age group (<12 years/≥ 12 years)  and country will be included as fixed factors . Baseline  
proportions of nocturnal  awakenings requiring  SABA  will be included as a covariates and 
subject will be included  as a random effect . Parameters in the model are estimated by  [CONTACT_130708] -likelihood techniques as in Wolfinger and O’Connell  (Wolfinger & O'connell 1993 ) and 
Breslow and Clayton  (Breslow & Clayton 1993) . From the GLMM model,  the odds ratio for 
having a day  with nocturnal awakeni ng of active  treatment relative to placebo will be presented 
together with the coherent p- values and 95% confidence limits.  
 
The average daily dose of SABA over the two weeks diary assessment period (before V5, V6, 
V7, V8, V9 , V10  and V11) will be analysed by [CONTACT_3553] a mixed -effect model repeated 
measurement (MMRM). The model includes treatment, visit, age  group (<12 years/≥ 12 years) 
and country as fixed  factors , the baseline average daily SABA dose as a c ovariate and subject 
as a random effect . Different residual errors for each treatment group will be speficied and the 
within-subject correlated errors is modelled with a Toeplitz structure ( TOEP ). A between 
treatment comparison will be performed by [CONTACT_3553] a t -test with Kenward- Roger degrees of 
freedom a pproximation . The resulting p- value will be reported together with the difference in 
adjusted means. In addition the relative difference will be reported together with 95% 
confidence limits calculated based on Fieller’s theorem.  
 
Percentage predicted FEV 1 assessed eve ry 4 month  after randomisation will be analysed by 
[CONTACT_3553] a MMRM. The model includes treatment, visit and age group (<12 years/≥ 12 years)  
and country  as fixed  factors , the baseline percentage predicted FEV [ADDRESS_147764]- Roger degrees of freedom approximation . The 
resulting p- value will be reported together with the difference in adjusted means. In addition the 
relative difference will be reported together with 95% confidence limits calculated based on Fieller’s theorem.  
 The average TCRS  over the two week diary assessment ( before V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10  and 
V11) will be analysed by [CONTACT_3163] a MMRM. The analysis includes the square root transformed 
average TCRS as response variable; treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction , age 
group (<12 years/≥ 12 years)  and country  as fixed factors ; the square root transformed baseline 
score as a covariate and subject as random effect s. Different residual error s for each treatment 
group is specified.  For each visit, the between treatment compar ison will be performe d by 
[CONTACT_3553] a t -test. The resulting p- value will be reported together with the difference in back -
transformed adjusted means.  As additional information the relative difference of the back -
transformed adjusted means is reported together with 95% confidence limits. The latter is calculated based on Fieller's theorem . 
The average rhinitis DSS, the average rhinitis DMS, the average total combined rhinoconjunctivitis score, the average rhinoconjunctivitis DSS,  the average rhinoconjunctivitis 
DMS  will be analysed using a similar MMRM model as described for the average TCRS.  
The average asthma  DSS score and ACQ /ACQ -IA will also be analysed by [CONTACT_3553] a MMRM 
model.

Section 12.4. A sample size reassessment is  planned based on blinde d data , see section 15.2. 
15.12  Subgroup a nalyses  
Subgroup analyses of the rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations during the efficacy 
evaluation period (period 4)  include age (5-11, 12-17 years), sex, race  (caucasian, non-
caucasian) , asthma treatment,  allergen sensitivity  (mite only, mite + others) , geographic 
location. The trial is not powered to detect  a treatment effect within a subgroup  and the 
subgroup analyses will thus only be descriptive in nature.  
A forest plot will be provided by [CONTACT_130710]. The plot w ill display  the 
estimated ratio of rates  to placebo (and corresponding confidence interval) for each subgroup. 
The estimated ratio of rates  is calculated using the NB regression model  defined in section 15.8 
and based on all observed data in FAS.  
15.13  Handling of missing data  
For the primary endpoint, annualised rate of clinically relevant asthma exacerbations, missing 
data can occur in two ways.  
1) A subject who discontinues treatment or trial before period [ADDRESS_147770] any 
observation of the primary endpoint.  
2) A subject  who discontinues treatment or trial during period [ADDRESS_147771] observations  of 
the primary efficacy endpoint for less than 20 months. 
The efficacy assessment period (period 4) begins on the 1st of September for all subjects and 
lasts until the end of trial or discontinuation from IMP. For a subject who discontinues treatment 
prem aturely in period [ADDRESS_147772] Model (GLMM)  and under a missing at 
random (MAR) assumption, the method provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect that would have been observed if all subjects had continued on treatment for the full trial duration.

Subjects who discontinue IMP  prior to pe riod 4 will not contribute to the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
Data from 2 previous phase II/III trials (MT -02, MT -04) with the HDM  SLIT -tablet in adult 
subjects with HDM allergic asthma suggest that up to 10% of all subjects are expected to 
discontinue treatment or trial prior to entering period 4.  
To evaluate the sensitivity of the results of the primary efficacy analysis with respect to missing data,  including the MAR assumption,  the following sensitivity analysis will be performed:  
1) Subjects who discontinu e IMP treatment prior to the efficacy assessment period (period 
4) will be imputed by [CONTACT_130711] (period 3) until IMP/ trial discontinuation, i.e. , 
the num ber of asthma exacerbations in period [ADDRESS_147774] obtained in period 3 had the subjects continued on IMP for the same length of time in 
period 4.  This imputed dataset is based on all randomised subjects and will be analysed 
using the negative binomial regression model (GLMM) specified for the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
2) Missing data for subjects who discontinue  IMP/trial prematurely in period 4 will  be 
imputed using a conditional “ jump to reference” approach. Subjects are assumed to be 
switched to the placebo arm after discontinuation in period [ADDRESS_147775] of the planned duration of the trial. Multiple copi[INVESTIGATOR_130643]. Each 
copy will then be analysed using the negative binomial regression model (GLMM) 
specified for the primary efficacy analysis. The resulting estimates and standard 
deviations for the multiple data sets are finally pooled to one single estimate and 
associated standard deviation using the method of Rubin (Rubin D.B 1987) .

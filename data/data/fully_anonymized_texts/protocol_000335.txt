 INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND  
 
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among 
pediatric and adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. (13-15) Due to the often asymptomatic nature of disease 
progression serial surveillance is recommended for all cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], however 
current techniques are either invasive and/or lack sensitivity to detect early stages of CAV due to its significa nt effect on coronary microvasculature. Real time myocardial perfusion 
echocardiography (RTMPE) is a safe and feasible non -invasive technique commonly used to 
diagnose coronary disease,  and offers an attractive alternative for CAV detection.  
 The incidence of CAV is approximately 10% at [ADDRESS_96738]-transplant, 30% at 5 years and 50% at [ADDRESS_96739] 
year.(13) CAV is a diffuse and accelerated fibro -proliferative process that affects both the large 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_88600] (Figure 1).(16) Early detection of 
CAV is critically important because it allows alterations to medical therapy to slow progression before revascularization is required. Early detection is challenged by [CONTACT_88615], making routine CAV screening the current standard of care for 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Invasive coronary angiographic (ICA) imaging is the gold standard for the detection of CAV, but is invasive (and may require a general anesthetic in the pediatric population) and exposes the patient to ionizing radiation, while current noninvasive methods best 
evaluate the large vessels with limitations for the detection of small vessel dis ease.  
 
The objectives of this study are to determine the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of RTMPE to detect CAV in pediatric and adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. We hypothesize that RTMPE is an 
effective non -invasive method for CAV detection in these populations, and that perfusion 
deficits will correlate with significant coronary artery stenosis identified by [CONTACT_88616].   
Real-time myocardial perfusion echocardiography ( RTMPE) may offer an attractive alternative 
to ICA for the detection of CAV.(17-20) RTMPE utilizes the intravenous administration of 
biologically -inert microbubbles to assess myocardial perfusion,(6) and has demonstrated utility 
for identifying small vessel coronary artery disease.(7) Although contrast echocardiography has found common application for evaluation of coronary artery disease in adult non-transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],(6) this safe and potentially useful imaging modality remains understudied in CAV 
with only two small single center studies p ublished in the current literature (Figure 2).(21,22) 
The contrast medium administered in RTMPE is routinely used without significant side effects in adults (8,23,24) and has been studied in pediatric populations with no adverse effects.(12) The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic utility of RTMPE for the 
detection of CAV in adult and pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88601] a multicenter experience

 Cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88602] ([COMPANY_002]ster , MN) will be in cluded. The 
study population will be divided into adult and pediatric subgroups. Consenting patients will 
undergo rest and pharmacologic stress perfusion RTMPE. Results of RTMPE will be correlated 
with wall motion assessment by [CONTACT_88617] (including intravascular ultrasound findings when available). We 
expect that RTMPE will be well tolerated and findings of myocardial perfusions defects will correlate with current CAV surveillance techniques. RTMPE may represent a preferred method 
and new clinical standard for CAV surveillance among adult and pediatric cardiac transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

OBJECTIVES  
 
• To determine the feasibility of real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography 
(RTMPE) for the detection of coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in pediatric and 
adult cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
• To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RTMPE for the detection of CAV in pediatric 
and adult cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88603]. 
 
 
HYPOTHESIS  
 
RTMPE is a feasible and effective non -invasive method to detect significant CAV in pediatric 
and adult cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Perfusion deficits will correlate with significant coronary 
artery stenosis identified by [CONTACT_88618], and may identify diffuse small vessel disease more effectively than current noninvasive techniques.  
 
 
STUDY DESIGN  
 
This will be a prospective, observational cohort study. The study population will be divided into 
adult (age ≥18 years -old) and pediatric (age <18 years -old) subgroups, each with a separate 

 
IRB #: 15 -007825                                      Page 5 of 10                                  Version 4: August 04, [ADDRESS_96741] and dobutamine stress RTMPE at in the echocardiography laboratory using a standardized imaging protocol.(8) Relevant clinical data 
will be collected from the electronic medical records .  
 
Dobutamine stress echocardiograms will be performed per institutional protocol.  
For adults, standard dosing of DEFINITY® (Perflutren Lipid Microsphere) Injectible 
Suspension ultrasound contrast  agent  will be used.  For each adult, the vial of DEFINITY® 
contrast  will be divided in half (~ 0.75 mL) and  drawn up into two  30 mL  syringe s pre -filled with 
29.25 mL of normal saline. Hand injections of the solution will be performed at baseline, pre-peak, and peak perfusion stages. 
 For pediatric patients  > [ADDRESS_96742] adult dosing will be used. For pediatric patients under 
60 kg, the dose will be 20 microL/kg diluted to the same concentration used in the adult dosing. 
Hand injections will be performed at baseline, pre-peak, and peak perfusion stages.

(13) and RTMPE (8) will be performed independently by [CONTACT_88621] a blinded fashion. Safety and adverse event data for RTMPE will be collected.
  
 
 
SAMPLE SIZE & DATA ANALYSIS    
 
A conservative estimated disease prevalence of 25% among adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55050] 10% 
among pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88606].(13) For both pediatric and adult patients 
there are  no prior large population studies for estimated diagnostic accuracy of RTMPE for 
detection  of CAV , and so sample size estimates are challenging. A target of 25 adult and 25 
pediatric patients for appropriate pi[INVESTIGATOR_88607].  Data will be expressed as the mean  ± 
standard deviation for continuous variables, and as absolute frequencies or relative percentages 
for categorical variables. Comparison between groups (with and without CAV by [CONTACT_88622]) for continuous variables will be done using analysis of variance, and for categorical variables using 
χ
[ADDRESS_96744] distribution basis. All comparisons of diagnostic accuracy will be made on the basis of binary outcome data analysis of paired within patient data. All p -values will be 2 -sided, 
and a value of ≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data analysis will be performed 
using statistical software.  
 
Safety Statement:  RTMPE utilizes the intravenous administration of chemically - and 
biologically -inert microbubbles to assess myocardial perfusion, and may demonstrate improved 
detection of small vessel disease. The ultrasound microbubble contrast medium used in RTMPE is routinely used without significant side effects in adults  for other indications.  It has been used 
in children on a case- by-case basis with no recognized safety issues unique to children.  
However, for the purposes of this study (perfusion), it would be cons idered off -label for both 
adults and children.  
 
 
IMPACT AND FUTURE RESEARCH PLANS AND KNOWLEDGE 
TRANSLATION  
 
This project in pediatric and adult transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88608] a larger multicenter study designed to compare the utility of a serial RTMPE 
strategy for CAV surveillance compared with current standard of care of either ICA or alternate 
stress imaging modality. Such a study would be longitudinal in nature and have the ability to track changes in RTMPE  over time, in addition to comparing sensitivities with alternate CAV 
surveillance strategies. Such research could lead to important potential knowledge translation

Heart transplantation is a life prolonging treatment for patients with severe heart failure. Heart 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88613] a unique disease that causes blockages in the 
arteries of the transplanted heart (coronary arteries) called coronary allograft vasculopathy 
(CAV). Because CAV often progresses without symptoms, transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_88614]. Current tests used to detect CAV are either invasive (with risk of 
complications) or may not be able to detect CAV in its early stages. Myocardial contrast 
perfusion echocardiography is a safe noninvasive diagnostic test that may be w ell suited for 
detecting CAV, however has not been well studied in heart transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. This study will examine the ability of myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography to detect CAV in adult 
and pediatric heart transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and comp are those results to current standard testing 
strategies such as invasive coronary angiography and standard stress echocardiography. This will 
help to determine whether myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography is a better test for regular surveillanc e of CAV for adult and pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

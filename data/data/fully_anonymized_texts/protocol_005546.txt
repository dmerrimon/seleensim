vii PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Title: Congenital Heart Disease Physical Activity Lifestyl e Study 
(CHD-PALS) 
  
Abstract: Over 40,000 infants are born in the U.S. with conge nital heart disease (CHD) 
each year, and with advancements in medicine, more than 90% of these 
individuals now live well into adulthood. This grow ing, and aging, population of 
CHD survivors is at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_711339]-rel ated complications such as 
coronary disease, heart failure, and hypertension, which fortunately are 
responsive to lifestyle change. An American Heart A ssociation (AHA) Scientific 
Statement highlights the important health benefits gained from increasing 
physical activity (PA) among children and adults wi th CHD, noting research 
evidence of better vascular health, reductions in h ypertension, and lower rates 
of obesity. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], evidence suggests that CH D survivors are less active 
than healthy controls, placing them at an elevated risk for preventable 
morbidity and premature mortality. Therefore, the c urrently study adapts a PA 
lifestyle intervention to adolescent CHD survivors (ages 15-18) who have 
moderate to complex CHD with the goal of increasing  MVPA and decreasing 
SB. The study is split into 2 phases; a total of 90  adolescent and caregiver 
dyads will participate in Phase 1 to determine part icipants’ eligibility for Phase 
2. Phase 2 is the randomized controlled trial in wh ich a total of 70 adolescents 
are randomized to either the comparison arm (Fitbit  and exercise prescription) 
or the intervention arm (Fitbit, exercise prescript ion, AND videoconferencing 
sessions with a coach). 
  
Population: Participants: For Phase 1 we aim to recruit 90 adol escents (ages 15 – 18 at 
enrollment) who have moderate to complex CHD, along  with caregivers. For 
Phase 2 we aim to recruit 70 adolescent and caregiv er dyads (35 per arm).  
  
Study Duration: 4 years (2017-2021)  
  
Participation Duration: Phase 1:  2 weeks 
Phase 2: 22 weeks with a 6-month follow-up assessme nt 
  
Description of the 
Intervention: Phase 2 of the study consists of being randomized i nto one of two arms; the 
comparison arm receives a Fitbit and an exercise pr escription based on the 
results of the Phase [ADDRESS_967670]. The interventio n arm receives a Fitbit, an

viii exercise prescription, and [ADDRESS_967671] over 20 weeks. Each session lasts  20-30 minutes and 
focuses on changing attitudes, perceptions of socia l norms, and perceptions of 
control over for engaging in PA, based on the princ iples of the Theory of 
Planner Behavior.   
  
Objectives: 
 The long-term goal of this research study is to est ablish an effective 
intervention for sustaining increased levels of MVP A that will reduce 
morbidity and healthcare costs for CHD survivors. T he objective of this 
study is to adapt a lifestyle PA intervention to tr ansition-age adolescent and 
emerging adult CHD survivors at greater risk for fu ture morbidity due to 
having more complex disease. This will involve (1) assessing feasibility of 
the intervention to participants based on subjectiv e ratings and objective 
recruitment and retention information, as well as ( 2) evaluating preliminary 
efficacy of the intervention on time spent in MVPA and SB, as well as 
improvement in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_711340] d by [CONTACT_711369] 2max . 
We hypothesize that (1) participants will positivel y rate the intervention on 
multiple dimensions, including easy to access, enjo yable, and pertinent. 
Additionally, recruitment and retention rates are p redicted to be >75%. We 
also predict that (2) participants in the intervent ion arm will (A) increase 
MVPA (primary outcome), (B) decrease SB (secondary outcome), and (C) 
demonstrate an increase in VO 2max  (secondary outcome) at post-
intervention relative to those in the comparison ar m. The rationale for the 
proposed research is to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_711341]: determining the efficacy of this int ervention for sustaining 
increased PA. Ultimately, we hope that knowledge ga ined from this line of 
research will extend longevity and optimize quality  of life for CHD survivors 
as they age into adulthood.

11 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE 
2.1 Background Information 
 
Congenital heart disease (CHD) comorbidities and co st  
Over 40,000 infants are born in the U.S. with CHD e ach year, and with advancements in medicine, 
more than 90% of these individuals now live well in to adulthood. 1-[ADDRESS_967672] need for intervention, 
as evidenced by [CONTACT_711370].6 Increased rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711342] $3.16 billion annually due to higher inci dence of coronary artery disease and heart failure 
among CHD survivors can be mitigated by [CONTACT_711371].7  
 
Physical activity (PA) engagement and benefits  
An American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Stat ement [ADDRESS_967673] been 
reported among adolescents with CHD, such that male s demonstrate higher cardiopulmonary 
exercise tolerance than females. 14  Therefore, adolescence and emerging adulthood are an optimal 
developmental time during which to intervene by [CONTACT_711372], such as PA, to prevent 
greater morbidity in through adolescence into adult hood. 
 
Sedentary behavior (SB) is a risk factor   
In addition to promoting moderate to vigorous physi cal activity (MVPA), a scientific statement by 
[CONTACT_34129] 8 also noted the importance of decreasing SB. Emergi ng evidence has identified 
inactivity as an equally important independent risk  factor for cardiovascular complications, even 
when guidelines for PA are met. Among healthy child ren, SB increases by [CONTACT_3450] 30 
minutes per year from childhood into adolescence du e to more time spent watching TV and/or

[ADDRESS_967674] primarily focused on structured 
exercise programs, often using a cardiac rehabilita tion model (3 days/week for 12 weeks). A 
systematic review of exercise training programs amo ng children and young adults with CHD 
indicated that exercise training was safe and impro ved fitness levels, including among those with 
complex cardiac lesions, but the long-term sustaina bility is relatively unknown. [ADDRESS_967675] sizes than other Health 
Behavior Theories for adolescents. 24  The Theory of Planned Behavior contains 3 primary elements 
hypothesized to contribute to behavior change: atti tudes about the behavior, subjective norms and 
perceived control. Interventions using this theory aim to address knowledge deficiencies and 
negative perceptions of the behavior (attitude), in crease perception of others’ approval of the 
behavior, such as family members, peers and medical  staff (subjective norm), as well as trouble-
shoot barriers while increasing efficacy (perceived  control). This framework may be particularly 
useful for CHD survivors since low PA in this popul ation has been attributed to inaccurate negative 
attitudes about the consequences of PA on the heart  or need for activity restriction by [CONTACT_711373] (e.g., sports coaches) during childhood.25,26   
 
Objective measures to assess physical activity (PA)   
Two studies have reported time spent in MVPA among adolescents with CHD as measured by 
[CONTACT_6317]. Duppen and colleagues (2015) 27  stated that only 30% of their sample did not 
meet guidelines for MVPA (>60 min/day), which contr asts a study by [CONTACT_711374]. (2013) 28  in 
which adolescents averaged 29 min/day in MVPA. Dupp en et al., 27  noted that cultural and

13 geographic differences may explain discrepancies wi thin the literature, further highlighting the 
importance of identifying rates of MVPA among adole scents in the U.S., of which the literature is 
completely lacking. Only 27% of “healthy” U.S. adol escents from the general population report 
any form of daily PA,29  suggesting that a large portion of adolescent CHD survivors in the U.S. 
are also relatively inactive, despi[INVESTIGATOR_711343]. A similar 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_711344] . Dua et al. (2007) documented that among 
young adult (age 31.7+11.0) CHD survivors in the Un ited Kingdom, only 23% who reported no 
functional impairments met national guidelines of a t least 30 min/day of moderate intensity PA. 30  
Sandberg et al. (2016) found that only 50% of Swedi sh adult CHD survivors (age was 
undefined) met the World Health Organization’s reco mmendations for PA, which was true for 
both CHD survivors and age- and sex-matched control s. 31  McKillop et al. (2018) reported similar 
averages for min spent in MVPA, as did Dua and coll eagues (26 min) on a small Canadian 
sample of 15 emerging adults. 32 Only 21% of U.S. adults from the general population  meet the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelin es of at least 150 min/week of moderate 
intensity aerobic activity. 29  This suggests that a large portion of adult CHD su rvivors in the U.S. 
are also likely to be relatively inactive, despi[INVESTIGATOR_711345]. 
 
These studies also draw attention to the need for u sing objective measures of PA to inform 
interventions, including using time spent in MVPA, as assessed by [CONTACT_62867], for 
inclusion criteria so that adolescents and emerging  adults in need of intervention are targeted. 
In the current study, objective measures of MVPA wi ll also be used to stratify random 
assignment of participants, as well as included as covariates in study analyses, thereby 
[CONTACT_711375]. This strategy will allow the detection 
of group differences with fewer participants and is  in accordance with guidelines for clinical 
trials. 33  The current study will also examine change in peak  oxygen uptake (VO 2max ), a measure 
of exercise tolerance, as a secondary outcome. VO 2max  has been identified as an independent 
predictor of 5-year mortality in young adult CHD su rvivors. 34  While change in VO 2max  has been 
commonly assessed as an outcome in cardiac rehabili tation-style exercise interventions for 
CHD survivors, increased MVPA may not result in imp roved cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863]. Current 
guidelines indicate that increasing moderate PA has  significant health benefits, even in the 
absence of change in VO 2max .  
 
Utilizing technology to facilitate behavior change:  Videoconferencing and a popular 
activity tracker (Fitbit®)  
Videoconferencing behavioral interventions have dem onstrated feasibility in other adolescent 
chronic illness populations, including diabetes 35,36 and inflammatory bowel disease, 36  as well as 
among adults at risk for cardiovascular disease. 37  Videoconferencing as a mode of delivery for

14 behavioral interventions has multiple advantages, s uch as eliminating some barriers to receiving 
the intervention (e.g., transportation, distance) a nd reducing costs for both providers and 
patients. Furthermore, videoconferencing and other modes of telehealth delivery have been 
shown to result in comparable rapport-building betw een youth and clinicians as face-to-face 
interventions and are accepted by [CONTACT_50634]. [ADDRESS_967676] been used with adolescents to track s leep, 40,41 and 
PA 42  in children with complex CHD as well as promote PA  as part of an intervention with 
children with cancer. 43   
 
2.2 Rationale 
 
If adolescents with moderate to complex forms of CH D demonstrate preliminary evidence of 
benefitting from a PA lifestyle intervention ground ed in the Theory of Planned Behavior, this 
may inform future intervention studies aimed at inc reasing levels of moderate to vigorous PA 
over time. 
 
With more than 50% of children and adolescents with  surgically corrected CHD having early 
signs of atherosclerosis,[ADDRESS_967677] yet to b e published. 44  Morrison and colleagues 
(2013) 28  reported improved PA among adolescents with CHD af ter a 1-day group intervention 
conducted in a “motivational interview style” accom panied by [CONTACT_62083]-up calls (6 
months). Motivational interviewing addresses attitu des towards a behavior, self-efficacy and 
overcoming barriers, not unlike Theory of Planned B ehavior. However, recruitment rates for 
Morrison et al.’s study were low (31.4%), which que stions the generalizability of the findings, 
and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_711346] (VO 2max ). Due to the paucity of 
theoretically-driven interventions to improve lifes tyle PA among CHD survivors, The Theory of 
Planned Behavior will be used as the current framew ork for this study. This theory will allow the

15 identification of potential mechanisms of behavior change, such as attitudes, subjective norms 
and perceived control. Understanding the circumstan ces in which change is more likely to 
occur, or the mechanisms by [CONTACT_554244], will g uide both development and modification of 
the intervention to achieve enhanced effects in a l arger clinical trial. 
 
Thus, the long-term goal of this research study is to establish an effective intervention for 
sustaining increased levels of MVPA that will reduc e morbidity and healthcare costs for CHD 
survivors. The objective of this study is to adapt a lifestyle PA intervention to transition-age 
adolescent CHD survivors who are at greater risk fo r future morbidity due to having more 
complex disease. This will involve (1) assessing fe asibility of the intervention to participants 
based on subjective ratings and objective recruitme nt and retention information, as well as (2) 
evaluating preliminary efficacy of the intervention  on time spent in MVPA and SB, as well as 
improvement in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_711340] d by [CONTACT_711369] 2max . With the 
hypothesis that (1) participants will rate the inte rvention as not burdensome, easy to access, 
and appealing. Additionally, recruitment and retent ion rates are predicted to be >75%.  We also 
hypothesize that (2) participants in the interventi on arm will (A) increase MVPA, (B) decrease 
SB, and (C) demonstrate an increase in VO 2max  at post-intervention relative to those in the 
comparison arm. The rationale for the proposed research is to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] t hat will shape 
the next phase of investigation: determining the ef ficacy of this intervention for sustaining 
increased PA. Ultimately, we hope that knowledge ga ined from this line of research will extend 
longevity and optimize quality of life for CHD surv ivors as they age further into adulthood.  
 
Eligible participants are [ADDRESS_967678]-
intervention and 6-month follow-up assessments. In addition to the Fitbit and exercise 
prescription, Participants in the intervention arm receive 8 20-30 min videoconferencing 
sessions (i.e. FaceTime, Google Hangouts or Skype) with a PA coach, which take place over 
the course of 20 weeks. Intervention arm participan ts will also be invited to partake in a focus 
group, which will be held via videoconferencing (4- 6 focus groups with 6-8 participants in each 
group). 
 
Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a guide, in tervention sessions focus on changing 
attitudes, perceptions of social norms, and percept ions of control towards PA. This theory was 
chosen given its larger effect size in internet-bas ed interventions for adolescents when

2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits 
2.3.1 Potential Risks 
 
The current research study complies with the federa l regulations definition of “minimal risk” [§45 
CFR 46.102(i)] “that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the 
research are not greater, in and of themselves, tha n those ordinarily encountered in daily life or 
during the performance of routine physical or psych ological examinations or tests.” 
Consequently, the CHD-PAL Study was reviewed by [CONTACT_711376] 
§45 CFR 46.404 “Research not involving greater than  minimal risk.”  
 
Exercise training has been established as safe for most CHD survivors and PA promotion in this 
population is highly recommended. Nevertheless, we have designed a protocol that implements 
several safeguards to reduce potential risk. Before  a potential participant is approached for 
recruitment, his/her cardiologist is contact[INVESTIGATOR_99628] d etermine if the adolescent is able to safely 
engage in MVPA. After receiving the cardiologist’s approval and the CHD survivors is recruited, 
then he/she undergoes an exercise stress test to ru le out the presence of arrhythmia or cardiac 
ischemia, which would preclude them from engaging i n regular MVPA, and therefore exclude 
them from participating in Phase [ADDRESS_967680] results 
demonstrate arrhythmia or cardiac ischemia both the  participant and the participants’ primary 
cardiologist are notified. Although learning this i nformation could be distressing to participants or 
their caregivers, identification of an abnormality would have potential benefits to participants as 
well. 
 
Similar to the exercise stress test, participants i n the intervention arm may experience 
uncomfortable physical sensations due to exercising , including sore muscles, fatigue, and 
shortness of breath. If the participant has new car diac-related symptoms since his/her last 
Adolescent CHD survivors PA engagement Updated:

 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
 
 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
[ADDRESS_967681] (i.e. 
PA coaches) will recommend contact[CONTACT_711377]’s cardiologist and the study procedures 
are put on hold until the cardiologist clears the p articipant to return to the study. The 
interventionist also contacts the study PI, [CONTACT_711415] kson, who notifies the participant’s cardiologist 
that the participant is experiencing symptoms.  
 
During videoconferencing, PA coaches conduct sessio ns in privacy and encourage participants 
to do the same. The same will be encouraged for tho se who participate in the focus groups. 
Coaches undergo the same training as other research  staff at NCH, including completing 
Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CI TI) certification and a day-long instructional 
seminar on protecting human subjects. Videoconferen cing has a lower risk of privacy breach 
than email communications. Should technical difficu lties (e.g., WiFi issues, recorder error) occur 
during the videoconferencing sessions, PA coaches w ill make adjustments in accordance with 
privacy and confidentiality guidelines to conduct t he session and/or document the content of the 
session. These adjustments may include (but are not  limited to) conducting the session as a 
voice call (in the event of videoconferencing issue s) or writing a summary of the session (in the 
event of recorder error). Audio recordings and othe r documents resulting from these 
adjustments will be stored on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s secure  OneDrive platform. For the purposes of 
identifying and problem-solving common technical di fficulties, PA coaches will record all 
videoconferencing, recording, and other technical a nd practical issues. This record will also help 
identify sessions that may not be available for fid elity evaluation.       
 
Participants are informed that participation is vol untary and that they have the right to withdraw 
from the study at any time, as well as may refuse t o answer or may skip any question(s) that 
cause discomfort. While not anticipated, participan ts could experience some discomfort when 
completing survey items about their heart condition  or treatment history. However, this risk is 
very small. If discomfort occurs, it would likely b e transient and minimal. Participants are 
encouraged to discuss any concerns about the conten t of the survey items with study 
personnel, who have experience using these question naires and are trained to respond 
appropriately. The more likely risk to participants  is boredom while completing the 
questionnaires. 
 
Loss of confidentiality is also a potential risk; t hough, no more so than in any other research 
study. Risks of breaching confidentiality are minim ized in multiple ways. Participants are 
assigned a study ID number, which is used on all qu estionnaires (paper and online), as well as 
the accelerometer and Fitbit data. The only link be tween the participant’s name [CONTACT_711411], which is located on a pa ssword protected server on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s

19 3 OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Study Objectives 
A total of 90 CHD survivors (ages 15 - 18) and care givers are anticipated to be enrolled in Phase 1 
of the study, which establishes eligibility for Pha se 2. For Phase 2, the randomized trial portion of 
the study, we plan to enroll a total of 50 adolesce nts and caregivers. The aims of the study are to: 
 
1. Aim 1: Assess feasibility of the intervention to participa nts based on subjective ratings. 
Hypothesis 1 : Participants are hypothesized to rate the interve ntion as not 
burdensome, easy to access, and appealing. Addition ally, recruitment and retention 
rates are predicted to be >75%. 
 
2. Aim 2: Evaluate preliminary efficacy of the intervention o n time spent in MVPA and SB, as 
well as improvement in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_711350] 2max .   
Hypothesis 2 : Participants in the intervention arm will (A) inc rease MVPA relative to 
those in the comparison arm at post-intervention, ( B) decrease SB relative to those 
in the comparison arm, and (C) demonstrate an incre ase in VO 2max  at post-
intervention relative to those in the comparison ar m. 
 
3. Aim 3 (Exploratory):  Explore mechanisms of change in MVPA and SB, as sp ecified by 
[CONTACT_39411], including attitudes  (i.e., knowledge about and belief in 
positive outcomes from PA), normative beliefs (i.e. , participant-report of 
family/friend/physician beliefs about and support o f PA) and perceived behavioral control 
(i.e., barriers and efficacy for PA).

they are compensated $20. Parking and mileage reimb ursement to/from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711351].  
 
If a participant engages in < [ADDRESS_967686], he/she is approached for part icipation in Phase 2. Once recruited, participants 
receive a Fitbit and an explanation of their exerci se prescription based on the results of their 
exercise stress test as provided by [CONTACT_711388]. If the exercise physiologist is not 
available to develop the exercise prescription, the  principal investigator, in consultation with the 
study physician, will develop the exercise prescrip tion based on guidelines provided by [CONTACT_45582]. Next, study staff open an envelope (p re-prepared by [CONTACT_4305], [CONTACT_711416]) 
to reveal the participant’s study arm designation. Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_711389] 1 (<21 min/day of MVPA vs. > 21 
min/day of MVPA) with randomly varying block sizes.  
 
Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms: the com parison arm, which receives a Fitbit and the 
exercise prescription, or the intervention arm, whi ch also receives a Fitbit and exercise prescription  
PLUS videoconferencing sessions (e.g., FaceTime, Go ogle Hangouts or Skype) with a PA coach (8 
sessions over the course of 20 weeks). Each session  lasts approximately 30 minutes and is 
audiotaped. The intervention arm focuses on changin g attitudes (e.g., identifying pleasurable 
physical activities), perceptions of social norms o f PA (e.g., problem-solving ways to receive support  
from family and friends) and perceptions of control  for engaging in PA (e.g., increasing self-efficacy  
through goal setting and reducing barriers), as out lined by [CONTACT_39411], to 
increase time spent in MVPA and decrease SB. The Fi tbit is used to facilitate goal setting and self-
monitoring for participants in the intervention arm .  
 
During the course of the study, participants in bot h arms are asked to participate in an interim 
assessment (between weeks 8-12), which includes 30- 45 minutes of questionnaires and wearing an 
accelerometer for 7 days, for which they are compen sated $50. Between weeks 20 and 26,

and mileage to/from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711352]. Upon completion 
of the post-intervention assessment, participants r andomized to the intervention arm will be asked 
to participate in focus groups lasting approximatel y 1.5 hours, to discuss their study experiences. 
There will be 3-4 groups that meet via videoconfere ncing with 6-8 participants per group. 
Participants who attend the focus group will be com pensated $50. Six months after their week 22 
participants will be asked to complete a 6-month fo llow-up assessment, which consists of 
completing less than one hour of questionnaires and  wearing an accelerometer for 7 days, for which 
they will be compensated $75.  
 
Medical information also is collected from particip ants’ online medical records to consider as 
covariates or moderators of the treatment effect, i ncluding sex and indicators of disease status 
(e.g., diagnosis, surgical history, functional clas s, number of medications, comorbidities, and the 
number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_627259]). 
 
Physical activity coaches are graduate students pur suing advanced degrees in medicine, exercise 
physiology, or other health-related fields. They ha ve undergone over [ADDRESS_967688] complet ed all required human subjects training.

23 5 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL 
The total target sample size for enrollment in Phas e 1 is 90 participants and in Phase 2, 70 
participants (35 participants per arm). A higher en rollment is expected for Phase 1 than Phase 2 to 
account for some participants being deemed ineligib le to proceed with Phase 2.  
Potential participants are identified through upcom ing cardiology clinic rosters who meet the age 
(15-18 years of age) and diagnosis (moderate to com plex CHD 3) criteria. Study personnel check the 
patient’s medical record to verify eligibility. If a patient appears to be eligible, study staff confi rm with 
the attending cardiologist that no additional reaso n/s preclude the adolescent from participating, 
including limitations to engaging in MVPA. Next, th e patient or if the patient is <[ADDRESS_967689]. An “opt out” ph one number is provided so that the caregiver can 
call and leave a message if they do not wish to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Approximately 1 week later, if no 
message was received, caregivers are called by [CONTACT_34450] y personnel. During the phone conversation, 
the objectives and primary components of the study are discussed. If a patient and caregiver are 
interested, verbal consent/assent (if <18 years of age) is obtained for completing online 
questionnaires and the exercise stress test at NCH is scheduled. During the stress test visit, written  
consent/assent for the stress test and acceleromete r assessment is obtained. If a patient and/or a 
caregiver cannot be reached via phone, they are app roached during their clinic appointment in 
person.  
5.[ADDRESS_967690] meet all the inclusion criteria t o be eligible to participate in the study. The crit eria 
include:  
1) Between [ADDRESS_967691] not yet gra duated from high school OR still living 
with caregivers 
2) Diagnosed with moderate or complex structural CH D  
3) Lives within 120 miles of NCH  
4) Able to complete an exercise stress test on a tr eadmill

24 5.2 Participant Exclusion Criteria 
Participants meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from the study. These 
criteria include:  
1) Do not speak and write proficiently in English  
2) Have a diagnosis of a genetic syndrome (e.g., Do wns, Marfans, Wolf-Parkinson-White)  
3) Have cognitive impairments that would interfere with completion of study measures  
4) Have been engaged in a formal exercise program w ithin the past 6 months, including 
cardiac rehabilitation  
5) Have undergone open-heart surgery or have had a valve replacement in the last 3 months 
6) Are prohibited to engage in MVPA by [CONTACT_711390]  
7) Are unable to complete a treadmill-based exercis e stress test 
8) Are currently pregnant 
After completing Phase 1, participants are approach ed for recruitment into Phase 2 unless they 
meet additional exclusion criteria, including:  
9) Having contraindications for exercise based on a n exercise stress test (e.g., exercise-
induced arrhythmias or evidence of cardiac ischemia ) 
10) Exercising >60 min/day of MVPA per the accelero meter  
11) Do not have internet access or a device for vid eoconferencing with a PA coach 
 
5.3 Treatment Assignment Procedures 
5.3.1 Randomization Procedures 
 
The PI, study staff, and the research participant d o not know the participant’s arm designation until 
the envelope, which was prepared the by [CONTACT_1758] s tatistician ([CONTACT_711416]) is opened. 
Adolescent CHD survivors PA engagement Updated:

 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
 
 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
25 Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_711391] s spent in MVPA per the accelerometer data in 
Phase 1 (<21 min/day of MVPA vs. > 21 min/day of MV PA) with randomly varying block sizes. 
Strata were based on the mean baseline levels of MV PA as reported in 2 studies of adolescents 
with CHD.27,28  
5.3.2 Reasons for Withdrawal 
 
Study participation is discontinued under the follo wing circumstances: 
 If participant’s cardiologist determines that he/s he is no longer eligible for the study due to a 
change in his/her cardiac condition. 
 The participant or the participant’s legal guardia n requests withdrawal from the study. 
 Development or reveal of any exclusion criteria (e .g., need for cardiac surgery). 
5.3.3 Handling of Withdrawals 
If withdraw occurs because a participant’s cardiolo gist determines that the participant should no 
longer be in the study due to a change in medical s tatus or the participant and/or caregiver 
request to be withdrawn, participants are asked to complete the assessments if possible and 
are included in intent-to-treat analyses. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_967692], 
participants’ cardiologists are asked about the eli gibility of each potential participant. Second, 
participants undergo a baseline exercise stress tes t, in part, to rule out any cardiovascular 
contraindications for PA. If limitations in PA exis t, these are incorporated into the exercise 
prescription developed by [CONTACT_711392]/principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_711353], and the PA coaches work with participants on 
PA within the parameters of the exercise prescripti on. Participants’ cardiologists have access to the 
results of the stress test, which are posted in par ticipants’ electronic medical record. However, the 
study will be terminated if the Data Safety Monitor ing Board (DSMB) or IRB concludes, based on 
their findings, that termination is in the best int erest of the participants.

26 5.4 Study Intervention Description  
 
During the Phase 2 of the study participants are ra ndomized into the comparison or intervention 
arm. Both the comparison and intervention arm parti cipants receive a Fitbit and are asked to 
complete the interim (between weeks 8-12), post-int ervention (between weeks 20-26), and 6-month 
follow-up assessments. In addition, the interventio n group is asked to complete 8 videoconferencing 
sessions with a PA coach over 20 weeks (Sessions 1- 4 occur weekly; Session 5 is in week 6; 
Session 6 is in week 8; Session 7 is in week 12; Se ssion 8 is in week 20) with each session lasting 
approximately 20-[ADDRESS_967693]- intervention assessment has been completed to 
provide feedback on their study experiences. The to pi[INVESTIGATOR_711354]:  
1) Understand the benefits of MVPA, find physical a ctivities they enjoy, and delineate pros 
and cons of engaging in MVPA using a non-judgmental  stance ( Attitudes ) 
2) Trouble-shoot engaging family and friends to be supportive of or engage in PA with the 
participant ( Subjective Norms ) 
3) Find creative ways to incorporate more MVPA, res olve barriers to PA and promote 
efficacy for engaging in MVPA, and identify intrins ic rewards for accomplishing goals 
(Perceived Control ) 
All of the sessions contain a goal-setting componen t based on the exercise prescription the 
participant obtained from his/her exercise stress t est. Participants receive text messages in 
between sessions, which contain motivational or enc ouraging content.  
5.5 Modification of Study Intervention 
Modifications to the study intervention may occur i f a participant experiences a change in their 
cardiac health during the course of the study and h is/her cardiologist recommends an alteration in 
the participant’s exercise prescription.  
5.[ADDRESS_967694] udy staff member, will listen to a random selection  
of 2 audiotaped sessions per participant and rated on their fidelity. Fidelity <90% triggers retrainin g

[ADDRESS_967695], participants are 
asked to wear a Fitbit, which is used by [CONTACT_711393] s to assess the participants’ engagement in 
MVPA. Coaches request that participants in the inte rvention arm sync their Fitbit each day so that 
coaches may monitor their PA levels and incorporate  feedback during sessions. Participants’ 
attendance at each session is documented. For those  participants in the comparison arm, they are 
told to sync their Fitbit regularly upon first rece iving the Fitbit, but are not contact[CONTACT_711394] F itbit

EVALUATIONS 
6.[ADDRESS_967697] identify patients who meet the age criteria and then check the 
patient’s medical record to verify their eligibilit y based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  I f 
a patient appears to be eligible the cardiologist c onfirms that they do not know of any reason the 
patient should not participate in this research, in cluding limitations to engaging in MVPA. The 
patient and/or their caregiver(s) (or their legal g uardian of record), if an adolescent, is then sent 
a letter from the attending cardiologist, notifying  them about the study and that study personnel 
will be in contact.  
6.2 Phase 1: Enrollment/Baseline (T1) 
 
Once the participant, and the caregiver have consen ted/assented, they are asked to complete an 
online questionnaire. The participant is also asked  to undergo an exercise stress test and wear an 
accelerometer for [ADDRESS_967698], which includes their VO 2max . 
Once completed, participants are compensated $100 f or their time for the baseline assessment.

MVPA and SB:  Participants receive a triaxial accelerometer (Act iGraph, model wGT3X-BT), 
sensitive to movement in all directional planes, to  measure the amount of time spent in sedentary, 
light, moderate, and vigorous PA. The accelerometer  is worn around the waist for [ADDRESS_967700] 
10 hours per day, only to be removed when showering  or submerging in water (e.g., swimming). 
Participants will also complete self-monitoring PA logs in the case they cannot wear the 
accelerometer (e.g. swimming). If baseline accelero meter and self-monitor PA log data indicate that 
a participant averages at least 60 minutes of MVPA per day, they are not eligible for Phase 2. 
 
Compensation:  Caregivers are compensated $20 after they complete  the baseline surveys. 
Participants are compensated $[ADDRESS_967701] 4 days (1 we ekend day, 3 weekdays), for at least 10 hours

Eligible participants from Phase 1 are met at their  home (or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711356]) to receive the ir 
Fitbit and exercise prescription, which is based on  the results of their stress test. After receiving the 
Fitbit and exercise prescription, the participant’s  arm designation is revealed by [CONTACT_711397], [CONTACT_711416]. Prior to opening the envelop, 
the study PI, study staff, and the participant are blind to the study arm designation.

33 7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
7.1 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, an d Analyzing 
Safety Parameters 
7.1.1 Adverse Events 
Definition  
For the current study, an adverse event is an unant icipated change in cardiovascular, 
musculoskeletal, or emotional symptoms that are (1)  concerning to the participant and (2) 
results in seeking medical attention, if cardiovasc ular or musculoskeletal in nature. Any 
condition that is present at the time that the part icipant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an adverse event. Howe ver, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an adverse event. Serious 
adverse events are defined as adverse events that a re severe in classification (as described 
below). We do not anticipate any serious adverse ev ents due to study procedures. Adverse 
events that occur for participants during the cours e of the study are comprehensively 
documented, including events during the stress test , symptoms reported during the course of 
the intervention from participants in the intervent ion arm, dates and reasons for pauses in the 
study protocol due to symptom reporting, and determ ination of ability to proceed by [CONTACT_4317]’ 
cardiologists. All unscheduled cardiology outpatien t visits, visits to urgent care or the emergency 
department, unscheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or any ot her changes in health are documented. 
Participants in the comparison arm are asked whethe r they sought medical attention in the 
aforementioned contexts during the interim and post -intervention questionnaires. Additionally, 
the occurrence of any adverse event or serious adve rse event may come to the attention of 
study staff during other study contacts (e.g., inte rvention meetings). 
 
Classification  
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_83618], 
[CONTACT_711417], according to the guidelines outli ned here.  
 
Severity : The following guidelines will be used to describe  severity: 
 Mild: Events require minimal or no treatment and do  not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities. 
Adolescent CHD survivors PA engagement Updated: 
 13 October 2020 (COVID-19) 
 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
 
 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
34  Moderate: Events result in a low level of inconveni ence or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interferen ce with functioning. 
 Severe: Events that require in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163014]/or resulted in death or permanent 
disability.  
 
Relationship to Study Intervention:  The degree of certainty about causality will be gra ded using the 
categories below. 
 Related: The adverse event is known to occur with t he study procedures, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study procedures ca used the adverse event, or there is a 
temporal relationship between the study procedures and the adverse event. Reasonable 
possibility means that there is evidence to suggest  a causal relationship between the study 
procedures and the adverse event.  
 Not Related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures caused the 
adverse event, there is no temporal relationship be tween the study procedures and adverse 
event onset, or an alternate etiology has been esta blished. 
 
Expectedness:  It is determined whether an adverse event is expec ted or unexpected, according to 
the following criteria. 
 Expected: Adverse event is consistent with the ris k information previously described for the 
study procedures. 
 Unexpected: Adverse event is not consistent with t he risk information previously described 
for the study procedures. 
Safety Procedures 
The current study has several procedures in place t o reduce the likelihood of serious adverse 
events. Potential participants’ cardiologists are n otified prior to being recruited for the study and 
excluded if the cardiologist has communicated or do cumented any concerns about that adolescent 
engaging in MVPA. All participants undergo a baseli ne exercise stress test and are not approached 
for recruitment for Phase [ADDRESS_967710] that the adolescent tell 
his/her caregiver (if they haven’t already done so)  and contact [CONTACT_280322]. Adolescents and 
their caregiver have given the study PI, [CONTACT_711418] n, permission to talk with the cardiologist in the 
instance that a concerning and/or new cardiac sympt om is reported. All study procedures are put on 
hold until the adolescent is evaluated by [CONTACT_711398].   
If a participant was to report bothersome emotional  symptoms to study staff during the course of the 
study, [CONTACT_213554], a licensed psychologist, will c ontact the participant to evaluate the severity of

if applicable, and the participant’s cardiologist. The cardiologist will make a determination as to 
whether the participant may proceed with the study if an abnormal event, or incidental finding, is 
detected.  
7.1.1 Other Medical Events 
Medical events not meeting the above definition of an adverse event.  
7.1.2 Unanticipated Problems 
In line with the OHRP definition, unanticipated pro blems include any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all  of the following criteria: 
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or fre quency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such a s the IRB-approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characterist ics of the subject population being studied; 
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly 
related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the i ncident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_341034]); and 
3. suggests that the research places subjects or ot hers at a greater risk of harm (including physical,  
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was p reviously known or recognized.

36 7.2 Reporting Procedures 
7.2.1 Adverse Events 
Any adverse events are reported to the DSMB at each  meeting and to the NCH IRB annually. 
7.2.1 Serious Adverse Events 
 
The DSMB is notified of any serious adverse events determined to be related to the intervention 
and are unexpected within 5 business days of discov ery. Other serious adverse events are 
reported to the DSMB at each meeting. 
 
Similarly, and per the NCH HRP-103 (updated 12/10/2 018), serious adverse events determined 
to be related to the intervention and are unexpecte d are reported to the NCH IRB within [ADDRESS_967713]-intervention  assessment that occurs 22 weeks after the start of  
the intervention, as this signifies study completio n. Adverse events and unanticipated problems will

 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
37 be followed until stabilization or resolution, or 3 0 days after study completion (whichever occurs 
sooner). 
All cardiac-related adverse events and unanticipate d problems are discussed with the cardiology 
medical team. The cardiology medical team determine s whether participation in the study is 
suspended, and for how long, or terminated.  
7.4 Halting Rules 
If it is found that the study intervention is relat ed to any serious adverse events, enrollment will b e 
temporarily suspended until a safety review is conv ened. The DSMB will decided whether the study 
should continue per protocol, proceed with caution,  be further investigated, be discontinued, or be 
modified and then proceed. Suspension of enrollment  (for a particular group or for the entire study) 
is another potential outcome of a safety review.

over symptoms while engaged in the treatment arm wi ll be provided to the DSMB. This 
summary is submitted to the IRB with the annual rev iew.  
7.6 Study Hypotheses 
 
Adolescent CHD survivors PA engagement Updated: 
 13 October 2020 (COVID-19) 
 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
 
 __________________________________________________ __________________________________________  
38 Hypothesis 1 : Participants are hypothesized to rate the interve ntion as not burdensome, easy to 
access, and appealing. Additionally, recruitment an d retention rates are predicted to be >75%.  
 
Hypothesis 2 : Participants in the treatment arm will (A) increa se MVPA relative to those in the 
comparison arm at post-intervention, (B) decrease S B relative to those in the comparison arm, 
and (C) demonstrate an increase in VO 2max  at post-intervention relative to those in the 
comparison arm.   
7.7 Sample Size Considerations 
A sample size of n=35 per group will provide 80% po wer to detect a large effect size [ADDRESS_967715] size (d=.6) 
with 55% power. Effect sizes from relevant studies examining change in MVPA range from large 
(d=.94; CHD adolescents in a motivational interview ing-style exercise intervention) 28  to small 
(d=.17; older adults with cardiovascular risk facto rs). [ADDRESS_967716] estimation with a relatively small 
sample size should be interpreted with caution, as it may under or overestimate the sample 
size. 64,65  
7.8 Planned Interim Analyses (if applicable) 
No interim analysis is planned.  
7.9 Analysis Plan 
 
Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility of the intervention .  
 
The mean/median ratings by [CONTACT_711400]. Recruitment rate will be calculated as a percentage of those recruited out of those 
approached. Percent adherence across sessions will be calculated for those in the intervention 
arm as the number of sessions attended out of 8. Th e retention rate will be identified by [CONTACT_711401].   
 
Verbal responses collected during the focus groups will be transcribed and then coded so that 
the frequencies of suggestions can be calculated. 
 
Aim 2:  Examine preliminary efficacy of the intervention on  time spent in MVPA.  
 
First, independent sample t-tests (continuous varia bles) or chi-square tests (categorical 
variables) will compare study arms on all variables  at baseline, including biological

[ADDRESS_967717] in an exploratory fashion.  
 
Second, the following statistical model for repeate d measures (RM), based on maximum 
likelihood estimation, will be employed, 67  yit  =  β0 + β 1Time t +  β2Time t xTrt i + ε it , where implicitly it 
is assumed that there is no main effect of Trt i, y it  is minutes in MVPA at time t, Time t is coded as 
[ADDRESS_967718] is β 2, which is the 
difference between groups on participants’ minutes in MVPA. In this RM model, baseline levels 
of minutes in MVPA is constrained to have equal mea ns across groups by [CONTACT_711402],  Trt i. This constraint yields a statistical test for β2 analogous to the 
test of the treatment group main effect per ANCOVA without requiring list-wise deletion to 
account for missing data. A similar strategy will b e taken for analyzing change in SB and VO 2max 
as secondary outcomes.    
 
Aim 3: Explore mechanisms of change in MVPA and SB,  as specified by [CONTACT_711403], including attitudes (i.e., knowle dge about and belief in positive 
outcomes from PA), normative beliefs (i.e., partici pant-report of family/friend/physician 
beliefs about and support of PA) and perceived beha vioral control (i.e., barriers and 
efficacy for PA).  
 
Differences between intervention and comparison arm  participants on attitudes, normative 
beliefs and perceived control at the interim assess ment will be examined using independent 
sample t-tests. These variables then will be includ ed in longitudinal mediation models exploring 
the indirect effects of the intervention on change in behavior as compared to the comparison 
group on MVPA and SB via the identified mechanisms at the interim assessment. We will use 
Mplus, which employs bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_711358], 
both individually and simultaneously, to estimate w hether one accounts for more variance in the 
treatment effect relative to another. We will follo w guidelines for testing longitudinal mediation 
within Cole & Maxwell [ADDRESS_967719] salient mechanisms of behavior change f or the R01 application. Significant Pearson 
correlations between baseline levels of proposed me chanisms of change and MVPA and SB 
may also be informative for adjusting the intervent ion prior to the R01 application to more 
directly address these factors. Sex  will be explored as a potential moderator of inter vention 
effects.   
 
Other Analyses: Relationships between other predictors and study ou tcomes will also be explored. 
For example, cardiac-related anxiety, body image di sturbance, caregiver perceptions will be

The investigator will ensure that this study is con ducted in full conformity with the principles set f orth 
in The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guide lines for the Protection of Human Subjects of 
Research of the US National Commission for the Prot ection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and 
Behavioral Research (April 18, 1979) and codified i n 45 CFR Part 46 and/or the ICH E6; 62 Federal 
Regulations [ZIP_CODE] (1997).  
10.[ADDRESS_967722] 
The NCH IRB has reviewed and approved the protocol for this study, including all associated 
documents such as the informed consent/assent, surv eys, and work sheets for the

well as contact [CONTACT_102]’s cardiologist, to veri fy their eligibility. If a patient appears to be el igible, 
the patient and/or caregiver(s) (or their legal gua rdian of record) are sent a letter from the attendi ng 
cardiologist, notifying them about the study and th at study personnel will be in contact. An “opt out”  
phone number on the letter is provided so that the caregiver(s) can call and leave a message if they 
do not wish to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Approximately 1 week l ater, if no message was received, the patient 
and/or caregiver(s) are called by [CONTACT_3462]. During the phone conversation, the objectives 
and primary components of the study are discussed. Also, potential participants are reminded of 
their rights as a participant, including that nonpa rticipation will not impact their care at NCH. If t he 
patient and caregiver, if applicable, are intereste d, verbal consent/assent is obtained for completing  
the online questionnaires and the exercise stress t est is scheduled. During the stress test, written 
consent for using the accelerometer and undergoing the stress test is obtained from participants 
and/or caregivers and written assent is obtained fr om adolescent participants. Participants retain a 
copy of consent/assent forms for their own records.

        THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 
Pursuant to the communications “Research Continuity  During the COVID-19 Pandemic #1” 
(3/13/2020) and “Research Continuity During the COV ID-19 Pandemic #2 (3/16/2020), and in 
order to eliminate potential hazard to research par ticipants, the CHD-PALS will enact the 
following procedures, effective 3/13/2020 : 
 Scheduled in-person home visits will be canceled a nd will instead be conducted 
remotely via videoconferencing (e.g., Google Hangou ts). The IRB has previously 
approved the use of videoconferencing for the deliv ery of lifestyle interventions in this 
study. Videoconferencing has been reviewed by [CONTACT_941] N CH security team and was 
determined to have a lower risk of privacy breach t han email communications. In-person 
home visits will resume when determined safe by [INVESTIGATOR_498017] . 
 Study materials necessary to complete the virtual home visit (e.g., consent forms, FitBit, 
lifestyle intervention sessions notes) will be sent  to participants via postal mail or e-mail 
in advance of the visit. Study staff will confirm p articipant’s mailing address prior to 
sending materials via postal mail. Materials sent v ia postal mail will be issued tracking 
numbers, and study staff will monitor the status of  these materials.  
 Participants will provide written informed consent  during the virtual home visit. As noted 
above, consent forms will be mailed to participants  prior to the virtual home visit. Study 
staff will review the consent forms with participan ts via videoconferencing and will ask 
participants to sign the consent form (if deciding to participate) during the virtual home 
visit. Study staff will request that participants s how their signature [CONTACT_711414]. Study staff will document the date

home visit (in-person or virtual) must be completed  outside of this window. 
 Scheduled exercise stress tests conducted at the o utpatient cardiology clinic will be 
canceled until 5/30/2020 . Stress tests will be rescheduled when it has been  determined 
to safe to resume in-person research activities. As  a result, we will permit participants to 
complete exercise stress tests outside of the norma l window (i.e., Week 22). 
 Follow-up exercise stress tests that cannot be com pleted within 3 months of the end of 
the normal window due to the COVID-19 pandemic and clinical research restrictions will 
not be (re)scheduled. Participants will receive par tial compensation for completing other

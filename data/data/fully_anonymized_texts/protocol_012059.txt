Protocol:  CSAS   5 
 Purpose:  
The primary objective is to identify the comparative effectiveness of existing screening and diagnostic 
tools  for sleep apnea to promote earlier detection (thus treatment) during inpatient rehabilitation for 
moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).  
 
Background:  
Given that sleep is critical for neural repair and disordered sleep may play a role in slowing  functional 
recovery and prolonging rehabilitation, early detection of sleep apnea is critical (Stakeholder Input). T he 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ’s (AHRQ) Comparative Effectiveness Review highlighted 
insufficient comparative effectiveness evidence for sleep apnea diagnostic and screening tools. This is a 
prospective, observational cohort study conducted on inpatient rehabilitation units at six Traumatic 
Brain Injury (TBI) TBI Model System sites. The diagnostic utility of existing sleep stud ies is needed to 
inform clinical management during acute recovery from TBI.  
 
Goals of the Study:  
(Aim 1: Screening) For individuals with TBI, determine comparative effectiveness of the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) endorsed screening tools and objective actigraphy (ACG) to identify 
those at high risk of sleep apnea as diagnosed through Lev el 1 polysomnography (PSG) which is the 
criterion standard. (Aim 2: Diagnosis). Determine the diagnostic accuracy (non -inferiority) of portable 
diagnostic testing (more accessible test) relative to Level 1 PSG (laboratory -quality study; criterion 
standard,  less accessible test) in determining presence of sleep apnea in patients with acute TBI during 
inpatient rehabilitation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Duration of the Study:  
The study completed enrollment and met recruitment goals within a [ADDRESS_1277308] Description  and Intended Use : 
Sleep Apnea Screening Tools (comparators)  
STOPBANG (OSA Screening Comparator). The STOPBANG is comprised of eight (8) items that refer to 
Snoring, Tiredness, Observed breathing pauses during sleep, treatment for high blood Pressure, 
elevated Body mass index, older Age, wide Neck circumference, and male Gender. An affirmative 
response to 2 items indicates low risk, 3 -4 items intermediate risk , 5-8 items high risk.  
 
Berlin  (OSA Screening Comparator). The Berlin Questionnaire is a 10 -item measure that evaluates risk 
factors for sleep apnea into three (3) categories (snoring severity, excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_909871]). Positivity in two or more of these categories is associated 
with a high likelihood of clinically -relevant sleep apnea.  
 
Multivariate Apnea Prediction Index  (MAPI; OSA Screening Comparator). The questionnaire consists of 
three breathing -related questions and utilizes information on demographics (sex, weight, height, age), 
from which a probability of having sleep apnea (0 -100%) can be calculated.  
 
Actigraphy  (ACG; Comparator). A wrist -worn accelerometer (Actiwatch Spectrum, Philips/Respi[INVESTIGATOR_909872], 
Bend, OR) was used to document sleep metrics during the trial. Activity data informing sleep statistics 
were recorded in 15 -second intervals.  
 
Diagnostic Comparators  
Protocol:  CSAS   6 
 Level 1 Polysomnography (gold standard method) is the criterion standard for diagnosi ng sleep apnea 
with overnight monitoring conducted routinely in a sleep laboratory with a registered polysomnography 
technician in attendance to assure quality of the study through monitoring of data collection using 
computer interfaces. All sites utilized  a uniform system which for this trial was the Philips Alice 6 LDx 
Diagnostic Sleep System with results scored in and generated by [CONTACT_909889] G3 version 3.8.1 
software. The Alice has the capability for up to 55 channels of information collected during overnight 
monitoring to diagnose sleep disorders including 19 EEG (electroencephalography) inputs, 5 dedicated 
EMG (electromyography) channels, 3 Chin EMG inputs, EOG (ocular) channels and 7 ECG (heart) 
channels. Additional features include measurem ent of thermal flow, snoring, body position, actimeter 
inputs, light sensors, pulse oximetry, chest and abdominal effort with 8 AUC inputs, and video and audio 
integration.  Many devices are available on the market. Clinician stakeholders on the study (wit h no 
conflicts of interest) recommended the system chosen for study purposes.  
 
Portable Sleep Studies (comparator for non -inferiority) are also known as home sleep apnea tests 
(HSATs in the sleep medicine field). The portable sleep study device used in th is trial was the Nox T -3 
Monitor [Nox Medical Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland] and Noxturnal version 4.4.[ADDRESS_1277309] and abdominal effort (2), thermal 
flow (1), and pulse oxim etry (1) along with audio recording of snoring. It does not utilize 
electroencephalography data to determine sleep states which is included in the scoring of sleep apnea 
using the criterion standard test, Level 1 PSG.  Technicians do not monitor the qualit y of the study 
information being collected overnight.  Many devices are available on the market. Clinician stakeholders 
on the study (with no conflicts of interest) recommended the system chosen for study purposes.  
 
Product Acquisition:  
The screening tests  are in the public domain thus no cost to the participant or study institutions. The 
diagnostic tests, supplies, and software were purchased using grant funding for study purposes.  
 
Potential Benefits and Risks to the Participants  
Protections Against Risk Implemented at Start of Trial:   To minimize the risk of uncomfortable questions 
on assessments, participants are instructed during the informed consent process that they can decline 
to answer any question or discontinue participati on at any point in the study. Participants will be 
informed in the consent form that they do not have to discuss any topi[INVESTIGATOR_909873]. In addition, participants are informed during t he 
consent process they are free to stop an assessment at any time. Participants are also informed before 
each assessment period that they may refuse to answer any questions or procedures that make them 
feel uncomfortable. Any discomfort from wearing the s leep monitoring equipment (ACG or PSG), either 
physical or emotional, should be readily resolved with adjustments and repositioning. Continuous 
monitoring by a registered sleep technician during the  PSG study will provide the participant with 
physical assi stance for adjusting the equipment and with reassurance for the duration of the study. Any 
skins problems related to wearing the equipment, should be readily treated with skin lotion and 
repositioning the device. If the sleep assessment procedures are dete rmined to be too physically or 
emotionally uncomfortable for the participant by [CONTACT_909890], he/she may be 
administratively withdrawn from the study. All changes in the participant’s medical status during an 
assessment will be communi cated to clinical staff for follow up. Should the participant appear to 
become medically distressed during the course of an assessment, research staff will immediately contact 
[CONTACT_2299]’s clinical staff and study investigators for follow up. If resea rch personnel discover new 
medical or emotional concerns during study assessments, the research staff member will promptly 
report this information to clinical staff and to study investigators for follow up. If , during the course of 
Protocol:  CSAS   [ADDRESS_1277310] sleep apnea or another sleep disorder, this information will 
be communicated to the participant’s clinical staff for follow up.  
 
All unanticipated problems and adverse events will be tracked by [CONTACT_909891]. An unanticipated problem is defined as 
any incident, experience, or outcome that is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) 
given the research procedures that are desc ribed in the protocol‐related documents; possibly related to 
participation in the research; and suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously  known or 
recognized. Unanticipated problems will be promptly reported immediately to the site investigator  and 
to the local IRB, as well as to the study Principal Investigators. An Unanticipated Problem Report form 
will be completed and returned to all re gulatory institutions as soon as possible.  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with a study procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the procedure. A 
serious adverse eve nt (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that 1) results in death, 2) is life‐
threatening, 3) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 4) results 
in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. AEs may be gr aded as mild (no limitation of usual 
activities), moderate (some limitation) or severe (inability to carry out usual activities) and attributed  
according to the relationship to the study procedures as not related, possibly related, or related. A 
clinical e vent form will be completed in the case of any and all reported adverse events associated with 
the treatment procedures. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_909874]. The original 
will be placed in the participant’s study folder. The p urpose of this procedure is to make certain all 
possible adverse events are examined to determine the proper action, if any, that needs to be taken. 
Mild and moderate AEs will be tracked and reported quarterly to the Principal Investigator. SAEs will be 
reported immediately to the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_909875]. An Adverse Event Report 
form will be completed and returned to all regulatory institutions as soon as possible. To protect 
confidentiality of data, all data will be maintained in a  secure database on secure servers. Within the 
database and on all data collection forms, numbers will be used in place of names or other direct 
identifiers. Any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_909876]. Only 
research  staff members assigned to the project will have access to documents and computer databases. 
All investigators and research staff involved in the project will have completed online training in 
protection of human subjects. Research staff will not disclose the identity of a participant or any 
information regarding participation to anyone beyond legal parties who are privy to this information.  
 
Methods  
Study Design : Prospective diagnostic clinical trial of comparative effectiveness of screening and 
diagnostic  tools for sleep apnea.  
 
Study population and selection criteria:   Potential participants were consecutive patients enrolled in the 
TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) at six sites (Tampa FL, Seattle WA, Dallas TX, Columbus OH, Denver CO, and 
Philadelphia, PA) desc ribed earlier and over 19 months. Study inclusion/exclusion criteria for the TBI 
Model Systems and this trial are described in Table 1.63 The requirement of TBIMS enrollment at time 
of consent for the clinical trial was relaxed at study -month 11 to allow f or earlier enrollment during 
rehabilitation but the clinical criteria remained unchanged.  
 
Recruitment Methods :  All participating sites received institutional review board approval for conduct of 
the study. Consecutive admissions were screened for eligibi lity. Participants who passed the first level of 
Protocol:  CSAS   8 
 screening (or their proxies) were consented and further screened for final eligibility including 1) ≥ 2 
hours sleep/night based on actigraphy placement or nursing logs/report, and 2) medical stability 
(inclu ding no emergent medical issues precluding overnight PSG and minimal to no post -traumatic 
agitation, as assessed by [CONTACT_909892]). Once determined eligible, an overnight PSG study 
was conducted by a registered polysomnographic technician (RP SGT) in the participant’s own bed. 
Within 72 hours of the PSG, questionnaire -based sleep apnea screening measures were completed with 
the participant and/or best source available using established TBIMS procedures by [CONTACT_909893]. Sle ep-related information during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909877] 
(snoring status, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) or medical record (weight, height). The patient -reported outcome 
was the primary source of data. When data were missing due to the parti cipant’s inability to respond or 
with unknown responses, it was imputed using best source data if available otherwise was considered 
missing data.  
 
Data collection and reporting :  Demographic and pre -injury medical histories, and medical record 
abstraction  were conducted by [CONTACT_909894].  Within 72 
hours of the PSG, questionnaire -based sleep apnea screening measures were completed with the 
participant and/or best source available using established TBIMS procedures  by [CONTACT_909893]. Sleep -related information during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909877] 
(snoring status, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) or medical record (weight, height). The patient -reported outcome 
was the primary source of da ta. When data were missing due to the participant’s inability to respond or 
with unknown responses, it was imputed using best source data if available otherwise was considered 
missing data. P articipants underwent simultaneous administration of Level 1 PSG (Philips Alice 6 LDx 
Diagnostic Sleep System with Philips Sleepware G3 version 3.8.1 software) and portable sleep study (i.e., 
HSAT using the Nox T -3 Monitor [Nox Medical Inc., Reykjavik, Iceland] and Noxturnal version 4.4.2 
software. Fully attended Level 1 PSG was conducted in accordance with the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine recommended procedures. 49 Staff were instructed to allow participants their normal sleep 
period.   
 
The lead center (James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Tampa, FL) served as a cent ralized scoring center for 
all sleep studies. All Level 1 PSG studies were masked and scored within seven business days of PSG 
completion with results subsequently databased and entered by [CONTACT_21171]. The Level 3 
portable sleep studies were masked  and scored in batches of 50+ studies approximately 3 -6 months 
after completion and scoring of Level 1 PSG to assure blinding of portable study scoring from the Level 1 
PSG results. All portable sleep studies were edited by [CONTACT_909895]; the automated softwar e results were 
not used in analyses. Editing entailed setting start/stop recording times based on assessment of 
embedded actigraphy (reduction in movement) in the portable device and elimination of data during 
periods of absent valid waveforms for oximetri c plethysmographic data, nasal pressure transducer data, 
and effort signal data.

Methods and Study Schedule  
Baseline Screening Visit :  All participating sites received institutional review board approval for conduct 
of the study. Consecutive admissions were screened for eligibility. Participants who passed the first level 
of screening (or their proxies) were con sented and further screened for final eligibility including 1) ≥ 2 
hours sleep/night based on actigraphy placement or nursing logs/report, and 2) medical stability 
(including no emergent medical issues precluding overnight PSG and minimal to no post -trauma tic 
agitation, as assessed by [CONTACT_909892]). Once determined eligible, an overnight PSG study 
was conducted by a registered polysomnographic technician (RPSGT) in the participant’s own bed. 
Within 72 hours of the PSG, questionnaire -based sle ep apnea screening measures were completed with 
the participant and/or best source available using established TBIMS procedures by [CONTACT_909893]. Sleep -related information during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909877] 
(snoring status, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) or medical record (weight, height). The patient -reported outcome 
was the primary source of data. When data were missing due to the participant’s inability to respond or 
with unknown responses, it was imputed using best sou rce data if available otherwise was considered 
missing data.  
 
Final Study Visit :  Fully attended Level 1 PSG was conducted in accordance with the American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine recommended procedures1. The RPSGT also conducted a physical examination of  the 
participants and rated agitation. Staff were instructed to allow participants to sleep their normal 
habitual sleep period with a minimum of two hours of sleep needed for adequate study. The lead center 
(James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Tampa, FL) se rved as a centralized scoring center for all sleep 
studies. All de -identified studies were scored by [CONTACT_909897] (CD, LW) and interpreted by 
a board -certified sleep medicine physician (DS, KC). All staff that scored and interpreted studies w ere 
blinded to other sleep assessments.  
 
Sample Size Justification  
Power Analyses from  Research Plan :   
(Aim 1) To test the hypothesis for Aim 1, a paired‐sample diagnostic analysis (estimated 
sensitivities/specificities) for each screening measure relative to the criterion standard, Level 1 PSG) was 
Protocol:  CSAS   10 
 performed using the same sample of patients. Prevalence of  sleep apnea (as determined by [CONTACT_292436] 1 PSG) 
was conservatively estimated to be 30% using investigators’ published reports of 37‐39% prevalence in 
acute rehabilitation TBI samples.36 -37 A two‐sided McNemar’s test, assuming a significance level of α = 
0.05, will have at least 80% power to detect a difference in sensitivities of 20% between screening 
measures for a sample size of 237. The power of the test will increase if the prevalence is higher than 
30% (e.g., a prevalence of 35% would yield 87% power with 237 subjects and only require 203 subjects 
for 80% power). Furthermore, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1277311] 80% power to detect a difference of  
20% in sensitivities between screening measures in detecting sleep apnea.  
 (Aim 2) To test the non -inferiori ty hypothesis of the portable device for diagnosing sleep apnea, the 
non-inferiority of SE and SP (relative to SEH = 0.9 and SPH = 0.6, each within Δ = 0.1) were jointly tested 
at the significance level of α=0.[ADDRESS_1277312] of two one -sided 1 -α* confidence 
intervals;96 SEH and SPH were selected a priori and were considered sufficiently large to obviate the 
need Level 1 PSG. For the purposes of the clinical trial, the study was powered to demonstrate non -
inferiority of Level 3 sleep stud ies relative to fixed values of sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP).[ADDRESS_1277313] 80% power to detect non -inferiority of 
SE to 90% and SP to 60% with a non -inferiority limit of Δ = 0.1, using one -sided e xact tests each at a 5% 
level of significance. In total, 214 subjects were available for analysis which yields 83.9% and 98.8% 
power, respectively, when testing the non -inferiority of SE and SP each at a 2.53% level of significance 
and maintaining a 5% lev el of significance when testing SE and SP jointly.2

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Primary Endpoint:  (Aim 1) Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve  
To determine the predictive utility of the screening tools for diagnosing mild (AHI ≥ 5), moderate (AHI ≥ 
15), and severe (AHI ≥ 30) sleep apnea, receiver -operating characteristics (ROC) curve  analyses were 
performed. A ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 – 
specificity) for all possible cut -off scores of the screening tools. The area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) 
and corresponding 95% confiden ce interval (CI) were estimated to provide a measure of overall 
discrimination for each screening tool. Standard diagnostic measures including sensitivity (SE), specificity 
(SP), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and fals e negative rate (FNR) 
were calculated across varying cut -off scores for each screening tool. The Youden index, commonly used 
to determine the optimal cut -off score where equal weight is given to sensitivity and specificity (defined 
as “sensitivity + specif icity – 1” was also calculated). 88-91 For MAPI [CONTACT_708161], cut -off scores of 0.1 to 
0.9 in increments of 0.1 were summarized along with the optimal cut -off score. For the Berlin, 
participants were either low risk (0 or 1 category positive) or high risk (≥ 2 categories positive), so there is 
only one possible cut -off score. For Actigraphy, since less sleep is thought to be associated with worse 
sleep outcomes (such as sleep apnea), [ADDRESS_1277314]. Median with interquartile range (IQR) are provided.  
 
(Aim 2) Sensitivity and Specificity Jointly Tested :  To test the non -inferiority hypothesis of the portable 
device for diagnosing sleep apnea, the non -inferiority of SE and SP (relative to SE H = 0.9 and SP H = 0.6, 
each within Δ = 0.1) were jointly tested at the significance level of α=0.[ADDRESS_1277315] of two one -sided 1 -α* confidence intervals;e3 SEH and SP H were selected a priori  and were 
considered sufficiently large to obviate the need Level 1 PSG.  
 
Protocol:  CSAS   11 
 Using individual significance levels of α SE = αSP = α*=0.[ADDRESS_1277316] of both SE and SP si multaneously remains no greater than α=0.05. If the lower 
confidence limits (LCL) from both 1 -α* = 94.9% confidence intervals are strictly above 0.[ADDRESS_1277317] would be established . Analyses 
were conducted for each AHI cutoff score (Total AHI ≥ 5, ≥ 15, and ≥ 30) for the overall sample and by 
[CONTACT_12125]. The non -inferiority thresholds were chosen based on a prior systematic review showing 
estimates of SEs and SP for AHI ≥5 were 0.96 (95% CI = 0.90, 0.98) and 0.76 (95% CI = 0.63, 0.85), 
respectively, across varying OSA prevalence rates.2  Based on the lower bounds of these 95% confidence 
intervals (rounded to the nearest 10 th), 90% SE and 60% SP with a delta of 0.1 were selected for 
declaration of non -inferiority.

Assessment of Safety  
Potential adverse events were monitored by [CONTACT_909898] s under oversight by [CONTACT_909899]. Potential risks associated with this type of observational sleep research are minimal. The 
sleep assessment procedures employed in this study are commonly used in clinical sleep evaluations. 
Risk of p hysical harm or injury is unlikely given non‐invasive nature of ACG and PSG. The Actiwatches® 
(ACG) wrist bands could be physically or emotionally distracting. The multiple monitoring devices 
required for (PSG) may be uncomfortable either physically or emo tionally. The placement of breathing 
bands could result in contact [CONTACT_8748]. Some of the questions asked during the assessment periods 
might be deemed personal or sensitive and make the participant feel uncomfortable. There was the risk 
that the study as sessments will discover a medical condition previously unknown to the participant such 
as the diagnosis of sleep apnea or another sleep disorder. There was also a chance that a participant 
could experience medical distress or a medical emergency unrelated to the study during the course of 
an assessment. There was a remote chance that an outside party may discover a participant’s identity 
and participation in the study. No risk to study personnel was anticipated.  
 
Pregnancy  
If a female participant was pregna nt during the trial, no alteration of study procedures was indicated.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring  
 A data safety monitoring board was not required.  
 
Data Monitoring  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_909878], good 
clinical  practice (GCP), applicable regulatory requirements, and that the data recorded were valid. To 
achieve this objective, the study team continuously  monitored the enrollment and completion of 
participants in the trial on a weekly basis using live -reports and bi -weekly, multi -center meetings.  
 
Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_435638]:  CSAS   [ADDRESS_1277318] at each site. (Consent)  
TBIMS procedures in place commonly identify eligible candidates prior to admission with consent 
obtained during rehabilitation. TBIMS procedures in place at each site track subject eligibility and reason 
for exclusion into the TBIMS. These data are submit ted quarterly to the TBIMS National Data Center for 
quality control purposes and subject tracking to meet data quality standards and input into Standards 
for Reports of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) diagrams. Consent and eligibility were tracked for this 
project using the same procedures already in place.

Detailed Title A phase IIIb, open, multi- centre gy naecological extension 
study  forthefollow -up of a subset of HPV -015 study  subjects.
Indication Cervarix is indicated in females from 10 years of age onwards 
for the prevention of persistent infection, premalignant 
cervical lesions and cervical cancer (squamous- cell carcinoma 
and adenocarcinoma) caused by  [CONTACT_494020][INVESTIGATOR_190507] (HPV).
This HPV -16/18 L 1 VLP AS04 vaccine was administered to 
the HPV-015 study  vaccine group. Cross -over vaccination 
will be offered to the subjects in the HPV -015 control group 
either by [CONTACT_909146] -16/[ADDRESS_1276325] been exposed 
to other high-risk HPV ty pes. 
The current study  will provide annual oncogenic HPV DNA 
testing and cervical cy tology  examination for a subset of 
HPV -015 subjects, who at their concluding HPV- 015 study  
visit: 
display ed normal cervical cy tolog y but tested 
positive for oncogenic HPV infection
were pregnant so that no cer vical sample could be 
collected
For eligible subjects, the duration ofthisgynaecological 
follow -up will be up to a maximum of four y ears after the 
subject s’concluding visit of study  HPV -015, since most 
cervical lesions develop within four y ears of infection and 
most oncogenic HPV infections are estimated to clear within two y ears [Trottier, 2008].
If very  few subjects are eligible for this study  at one HPV -015 
study  site and if adequate gy naelogical follow -up care is 
available through the local health care s ystem, these subjects 
may be referred to the local health care s ystem, provided that 
ethical committee approval is obtained by  [CONTACT_755079] .

Study visits per subject: Up to four scheduled visits at 
approximately  Months 12, 24, [ADDRESS_1276329]’s conc luding HPV -015 study  visit
Subjects are eligible to join the study  at an y visit.
Study procedures:
Subjects will enter the study  approximately  one year after 
theirHPV -015 concluding study visit. Annual visits will 
be scheduled for a maximum study  duratio nof 
approximately  four years
At each visit, a gy naecological examination will be 
performed and cervical liquid -based cy tology  samples 
will be collected for cervical cy tology  examination and 
oncogenic HPV DNA testing, if the cy tology  reading is 
normal or ASCUS .
The presence of oncogenic HPV infection will be 
determined b y the Hybrid Capture® II(HCII )test, which 
detects HPV DNA t ypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 
52, 56, 58, 59 and 68 [ Vernick 2003, Digene Corporation 
2002]. Cervical cy tology  examinatio n will be performed 
using the ThinPrep®Pap test.
Continued study  participation as well as further 
referral/treatment will be based on the test results from 
each visit , and will be aligned with theclinical 
management algorithm which is aligned with the 200 9 
American Societ y for Colposcopy  and Cervical Pathology  
(ASCCP) guidelines for use of HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cy tology  for cervical cancer screening in 
women 30 y ears or older.
The following clinical management algorithm will be applied:
Subjec ts with normal cervical cy tology and who are 
oncogenic HPV DNA negative , will end their 
participation in the study .
Subjects with normal cervical cy tology , but who are 
oncogenic HPV DNA positive in one single test, will 
be asked to return at the next study visit.
This outcome will only  be applicable to subjects who 
were pregnant at their concluding HPV -015 study 
visit so that no cervical sample could be collected at that visit.
Subjects with normal cervical cy tology , but who are 
oncogenic HPV DNA positive in two subsequent 
tests, will be referred to colposcopy .The result of the

Subjects with a single cervical cy tology  reading of 
ASC -US (aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_251148]) positive for oncogenic HPV DNA will 
be referred to colposcop y.
Subjects with a single cervical cy tology  reading of 
LSIL (low grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716]) 
will be referred to colposcopy .
Please note that a missing result for HCII will be 
managed as oncogenic HPV positive.
In case of referral for colposcopy , the post -colposcopy  
follow -up strategies are:
If no lesion is detected or the detected lesion does not 
require an y treatment, subjects will be asked to return 
at the next study  visit. 
If a lesion that requires treatment is detected, the 
subject should be referred to treatment according to 
local medical practice. Any  further management 
following local cervical therap y for cervical lesions 
will be handled according to local medical p ractice 
within the local health care s ystem. After treatment, 
the subject’s participation in the study  will end.
As management algorithms cannot define every  clinical 
situation, it is the investigator’s (or his/her designee’s) responsibility  to exercise appropriate clinical judgement 
in the medical management of each individual case.
Once their stud y participation ends, all subjects should be 
referred to their local health care s ystem. 
Subjects who have not developed cervical lesions by  [CONTACT_909147] y, but who are still positive for oncogenic 
HPV infection, should be informed of the potential risks 
of being positive for onco genic HPV DNA and the 
importance of continued follow -up.

The distribution of HPV ty pes varies within countries and between regions. HPV -[ADDRESS_1276342] prevalent oncogenic HPV t ype and is present in 
approximately  54% of cervical tumor specimens world wide. HPV -18 is associated with 
approximately  17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from

types (HPV -16 and HPV -18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases 
globall y [Clifford, 2003].
In the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is between 5% and 40% [ Baseman, 2005; Franco , 1999]. This wide variation reflects 
underly ing population characteristics (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), 
theuse of different HPV DNA test methods, and also differences in the sexual activity  of 
the individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed countries and 15% in developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], one author estimated [ADDRESS_1276343] women globally  [Bosch , 2002].

Liquid- based cy tology  tests and oncogenic HPV tests (HCII) will be performed at Quest 
Diagnostics (Teterboro, NJ, US) or another [COMPANY_004] designated laboratory . Each 
cytopatholog icalspecimen will be reported according to the Bethesda 2001 Classification 
of cy tological findings [Wright , 2002] . The terminology  will include a statement as to 
whether a specimen is satisfactory  or unsatisfactory .
The following categories for cy tology reading will be specified:
Negative for intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_251147]  (negative).
Negative/HCII negative (Normal/oncogenic HPV negative)
Negative/HCII positive (Normal/oncogenic HPV positive).
Negative/HCII quantity  not sufficient (Normal/QNS).
Unsatisfactory .
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_145582] (ASC- US).
ASC -US/HC IInegative (ASC -US/oncogenic HPV negative)

Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_530365] (ASC -H).
Low-grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (LSIL).
High -grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (HSIL).
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_138955] (AGC).
Invasive malignancy .
Specimens will be reported as “Quantity  Not Sufficient” (QNS) in the case where there is 
an ina dequate amount of cells for HCII and preferentially , a repeat sample will be 
collected. Missing HCII test results should be managed as oncogenic HPV positive.
Oncogenic HPV tests (HCII) will only be performed on normal and ASCUS cy tological 
samples.
The results of the cy tology  and HCII testing will be communicated to the investigator (or 
his/her designee) b y Quest Diagnostics (Teterboro, NJ, US), or another [COMPANY_004] designated 
laboratory . The investigator (or his/her designee) will not ify the subject of the test result

Any histopathological lesions will be biopsied or excised locally  according to local 
medical practice. Histopathological reports on biopsy  and excision specimens will be 
written according to local medical practic e. 
5.4.3. Clinical Management A lgorithm
The clinical management algorithm in Figure 3describes the management of all cy tology  
results obtained at study  visits. 
5.4.4. Unsatisfactory  cytological findings
When the laboratory results deem a cer vical liquid- based cy tology  specimen 
“unsatisfactory ”, study  personnel are required to repeat the specimen as soon as possible 
after cy tology  results have been communicated and not wait until the next scheduled 
protocol visit. Only  satisfactory  results of a repeat cy tology  result will count as the final 
cytology  result for that study  visit. 
In addition, cy tological specimens reported as “satisfactory  for evaluation- endocervical/ 
transformation zone component absent” should be managed according to the given
cytological diagnosis. These smears should not be repeated but the information may be 
used for qualit y control monitoring .
Missing cy tology  results will be recorded as “missing results” (in the case of lost/ 
damaged sample) and preferentially  a repeat cy tology  will be performed.
Specimens will be reported as “Quantity  Not Sufficient” (QNS) in the case where there is 
an ina dequate amount of cells for HCII and preferentially , a repeat sample will be 
collected. Missing HCII test results should be managed as oncogenic HPV positive 
according to the requirements specified in the clinical management algorithm (refer to 
Figure 3).
5.4.5. Abnormal cytology
Observation of abnormal cy tology  ASC -US (at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_909127]) positive for oncogenic HPV DNA as determined b y the HCII test will result 
in referral to colposcopic evaluation.
Observation of  LSIL (low grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716]) will result in referral 
to colposcopic evaluation.

The intervals between visits are outlined in Table 2.It is the investigator’s responsibility  
to ensure that the intervals between visits are followed as closel y as possible. If a subject 
misses a visit, the missed visit will not be performed, but the subject may  return to the 
next scheduled visit.If a subject becomes pregnant during the stud y, she will not undergo an y gynaecological 
examination nor have a cervical cy tology  sample taken during her pregnancy . The missed 
visit will not be performed. Three months after delivery , the subject may  return to the 
next scheduled visit. For subject that are pregnant at the last study visit, no conclusion 
visit will be performed. Women should be informed of the potential risks of being 
positive for oncogenic HPV DNA and ofthe importance of continued follow -up.
Investigators will follow- up subjects with SAEs assessed as being related to study  
procedures or SAEs assessed as being related to a concurrent [COMPANY_004] medication until the 
event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up, or, in the case of non- serious AEs leading to study

The investigator or sitestaff is/areresponsible during the study  for the detection and 
documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or 
serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol.
Each subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_909155] y should they
manifest an y signs or s ymptoms they  perceive as serious.
8.1. Safet y definitions
NOTE: The term AE denotes both non-serious and serious adverse events. In this 
study, only fatal SAEs, SAEs related to study participation , SAEs related to a 
concurrent [COMPANY_004] medication and AEs or SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study 
will be reported .
8.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicin al product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indicati on 
under study . 
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.

Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with vaccine administration.
Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action. 
8.1.2. Examples of an A E DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedure s (e.g.endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination ).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
For therapeutic studies, t he disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, 
signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorde r being studied, unless more severe than 
expected for the subject’s condition.
AEs may  include pre -or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -
mandated procedures (i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic re gimen).
8.1.3. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death.
b. I s life -threatening .
NB: The term ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subj ect was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479630] .
NB: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909129]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out- patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909130] c onsidered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909131], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639] ’occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.

8.3.2. Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS]. Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events
As a consistent method of soliciting AEs, the subject should be asked a non- leading 
question such as:
‘Have you felt different in any way since the previous visit?’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory , and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE on the eCRF or SAE Report screens as applicable. It is not acceptable for the 
investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals

18-AUG -2010 44The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and no t the individual signs/sy mptoms.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Assessment of i ntensity
Intensit y of the following AEs will be assessed as described:
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all othe r AEs, i.e. unsolicited sy mptoms, including SAEs reported during the 
study . The assessment will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.
The intensity  of eac h AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF or SAE Report screens as
applicable, should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal ever yday activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which preve nts normal, every day activities. I n 
adults/adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at work/school and would necessitate the admini stration of corrective therap y.
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  utilis ed for rating the intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can 
be assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.3.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator should assess the causalit y of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use 
clinical judgement to determine the relationship of AEs/ SAEs to study  procedures or to 
[COMPANY_004] concomitant medication. Alternative causes, such as natural history  of the 
underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy  and other risk factors will be considered and 
investigated.
There may  be situations when an AE/SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the AE/SAE to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The investigator may  change 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up information, amending the SAE 
information accordingl y.

After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide further i nformation to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals on the subject’s condition.
All SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_159292]/not

Investigators will follow- up subjects:
With SAEs or subjects withdrawn from the stud y as a result of an AE, until the event 
has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or until the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up.
Clinically  significant laboratory  abnormalities will be followed up until they have 
returned to normal, or a satisfactory explanation has been provided. Additional information (including but not limited to laboratory  results) relative to the subsequent 
course of such abnormalit iesnoted for an y subject must be made available to the Site 
Monitor.
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals may  request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully  as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investi gator is obliged to assist. I f a

[COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ policy  (incorporating ICH E2A guidance, EU Clinical Trial Directive 
and Federal Regulations) is to unblind any  serious adverse event (SAE) report associated 
with the use of the investigational product, which is unexpected and 
attributable/suspected, prior to regulatory  reporting. The [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Central Safet y 
physician is responsible for unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with 
specified time frames for expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 8.4.1 ).
8.7. Emergency  unblindi ng
For subjects who conclude the HPV -015 study  at Visit 9 or Visit 11, but agree to remain 
blinded until the final analy sisof study  HPV -015, the following applies:
The investigator, or other phy sician managing the subject, should contact [CONTACT_909157]’ Central Safety  Physician to discuss the need for emergency  unblinding. 
Alternativel y the investigator may contact [CONTACT_909158] y Physician. 
The investigator, or person designated b y the investigator, should conta ct [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals’ Central Safety  physician directl y or via the local safety contact (see 
below and Study  Contact [CONTACT_909159]) 
to discuss the need for emergency  unblinding. 
An investigator should request for unbli nding of the subject’s treatment code only  in 
the case of a medical emergency , or in the event of a serious medical condition, 
when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. 
The [COMPANY_004] Biolog icals’ Central Safet y Office will be allowed to access the individual 
randomisation code. The code will be broken b y the [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Central Safet y 
physician (see below and Study  Contact [CONTACT_909160]) onl y in the cas e of medical events that the investigator/phy sician in

applicable regulations, GCP, and [COMPANY_004] procedures.
11.3. Archiving of d ataat study  sites
Following closure of the study , the investigator must maintain all site study  records in a 
safe and secure location. The records must be maintained to allow eas y and timely 
retrieval, when needed ( e.g.audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any  
subsequent review of data in conjunction with assessment of the facility , supporting 
systems, and staff. Where permitted by  [CONTACT_5751]/regulations or institutional policy , 
some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format other than hard cop y 
(e.g.microfiche, scanned, electronic for studies with an eCRF); however, c aution needs 
to be exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must assure that all 
reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy  of the original and meet 
accessibility  and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard cop y, if required. 
Furthermore, the investigator must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these 
reproductions and that an acceptable qualit y control process exists for making these 
reproductions.
[COMPANY_004] will inform the investigator/institution of the time peri od for retaining these records 
to comply  with all applicable regulatory  requirements. However, the 
investigator/institution should seek the written approval of the sponsor before proceeding 
with the disposal of these records. The minimum retention time wil l meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that site for the stud y, as dictated b y ICH GCP, an y institutional

Amendment number: Amendment 1
Amendment date: Amendment 1 Final : 21 June 2010
Co-ordinating author:  Scientific Writer
Rationale/background for changes: 
Redundant text concerning oncogenic HPV DNA test results classification was 
deleted from Section 5.4.1.
According to the protocol, histopathological reports will be performed locally  and 
do not require reporting in the eCRF. This has been corrected in Section 5.4.2.
According to the protocol, colposcopy  should be performed on women with two 
positive oncogenic HPV DNA tests or one cervical cy tology  reading ≥ASC -US 
positive for oncogenic HPV DNA or one cervical cy tology  reading ≥LSIL
(missing HCII test results should be managed as oncogenic HPV positive ). This 
has been corrected in Section 5.5.
Oncogenic HPV testing (HCII) will only  be performed on normal and ASCUS 
cytological samples . This has been corrected throughout the protocol.
It has been clarified throughout the protocol that oncogenic HPV infection status 
andcervical cy tology  status do not have to be recorded in the e CRF , as these data 
will automatically  be transferred into the database .
The list of contributing authors has been updated.
The indication for Cervarix has been updated to be in line with the current Global 
Data Sheet.
Throughout the document, some minor co rrections (including typographical and 
formatting errors )and clarifications have been performed .

Synopsis
Indication [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ HPV -16/18 L 1 VLP AS04 vaccine is 
indicated in females from 10 y ears of age onwards for the 
prevention of pre -malignant cervical lesions and cervical 
cancer causall y related to Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (H PV) ty pes 
16 and 18. Cervarix is indicated in females from 10 years of 
age onwards for the prevention of persistent infection, 
premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer (squamous -cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) caused by 
[CONTACT_909170][INVESTIGATOR_493992] (HPV).
Rationale for the study and study designIf very  few subjects are eligible for this study  at one HPV -015 
study  site and if adequate gy naelogical follow -up care is 
available through the local health care s ystem, these subjects 
may be referr ed to the local health care s ystem, provided that 
ethical committee approval is obtained by [CONTACT_755079].
(Note, also amended in Section 1.2)
Study design Study procedures:
At each visit, a gy naecological examination will be 
performed andcervical liquid -based cy tology  samples 
will be collected for oncogenic HPV DNA testing and
cervical cy tology  examination and oncogenic HPV DNA 
testing ,if the cytology reading is normal or ASCUS .
The presence of oncogenic HPV infection will be 
determined by [CONTACT_909171]® 2 II(HC2 HCII ) test, 
which detects HPV DNA ty pes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 
51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68 [ Vernick 2003, Digene 
Corporation 2002]. Cervical cy tology  examination will be 
performed using the ThinPrep®Pap test.
Continued stu dy participation as well as further 
referral/treatment will be based on the test results from 
each visit, and will be performed according to a will b e

18-AUG -2010 63aligned with theclinical management algorithm which is 
aligned with the 2009 American Societ y for Colposc opy 
and Cervical Pathology  (ASCCP) guidelines for use of 
HPV DNA testing as an adjunct to cy tology  for cervical 
cancer screening in women 30 years or older.
The following clinical management algorithm will be applied:
Subjects with normal cervical cy tolog y and who are 
oncogenic HPV DNA negative, will end their 
participation in the study .
Subjects with normal cervical cy tology , but who are 
oncogenic HPV DNA positive in one single test, will be asked to return at the next study  visit.
This outcome will only  be applicable to subjects who 
were pregnant at their concluding HPV -015 study 
visit so that no cervical sample could be collected at that visit.
Subjects with normal cervical cy tology , but who are 
oncogenic HPV DNA positive in two subsequent 
tests, will be referred to colposcopy . The result of the 
subjects’ concluding HPV -015 study  visit will be 
taken into account at Visit 1.
Subjects with a single cervical cy tology  reading of 
ASC -US (aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_251148]) positive for oncog enic HPV DNA will 
be referred to colposcop y.
Subjects with a single cervical cy tology  reading of 
LSIL (low grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716]) 
will be referred to colposcopy , irrespective of their 
oncogenic HPV DNA test result .
Please note that a missi ng result for HCII will be 
managed as oncogenic HPV positive.
In case of referral for colposcopy , the post -colposcopy  
follow -up strategies are:
If no lesion is detected or the detected lesion does not 
require an y treatment, subjects will be asked to return
at the next study  visit. 
If a high-grade lesion that requires treatment is 
detected, the subject should be referred to treatment 
according to local medical practice. An y further 
management following local cervical therap y for 
cervical lesions will be han dled according to local 
medical practice within the local health care sy stem. 
After treatment, the subject’s participation in the study  will end.

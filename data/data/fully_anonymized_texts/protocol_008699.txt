In the [LOCATION_002], patients dependent upon parenteral nutrition (PN) receive parenteral fat emulsions 
composed of soybean oils. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_370094]. They have been implicated in predisposing patients to PN associated liver 
disease. Phytosterols such as those contained in soybean oils are thought to have a deleterious effect on 
biliary secretion.  Accumulation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_624132]. 
Children requiring prolonged courses of  PN are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_370095]. We 
hypothesize that although omega-6 fatty acid emulsions prevent fatty acid deficiency, they are not cleared 
in a manner similar to  enteral chylomicrons and therefore accumulate in the liver and resulting in steatotic 
liver injury. We  further hypothesize that a fat emulsion comprised of omega-3 fatty acids (i.e., fish oil) 
such as Omegaven® would be beneficial in the management of steatotic liver injuiry by [CONTACT_632656], the reduction of arachidonic acid-derived inflammatory mediators, prevention of 
essential fatty acid deficiency through the presence of small amounts of arachidonic acid, and improved 
clearance of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_309589]. Animal studies have shown that IV fat emulsions (IFE)  such as fish oil 
that are high in eicosapentaenic and docashexaaenoic acid reduce impairment of bile flow which is seen in 
cholestasis caused by [CONTACT_309620].  Furthermore, we hypothesize that that intravenous 
omega three fatty acids will be well tolerated and might reduce the inflammatory effect in the liver of 
prolonged PN exposure and could potentially reverse any hepatic dysfunction due to PN/IFE use.  By 
[CONTACT_309621]® in place of conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsions we may reverse or 
pr
event the progression of PN associated cholestasis and thus allow the patient to be maintained on 
adequate PN until they are able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally. 
1. Specific Aims /Objectives
1. To determine the safety profile of an intravenous omega-3 fat emulsion (Omegaven®)
UHypothesis for Aim 1 U: 
1.1 – After starting Omegaven® on PN, the rate of fatty acid deficiencies and imbalances will be as low as 
before Omegaven®. Also, the rate of triglyceride events > 400 mg/dL with Omegav en® will be similar to 
that se
en with PN administered with soy oil IFE (conventional emulsion, i.e., Intralipid®) . 
1.2 – PN containing Omegaven® will be safe for patients with respect to the risk of unexpected bleeding, 
c
oagulopathies, and other adverse events. 
1.3 – PN containing Omegaven® will promote more short-term growth and development than conventional 
fat emulsions.

Hypothesis for Aim 2: 
2.1 – Our primary hypothesis is that, after reaching bilirubin levels > 2 mg/dL, patients receiving 
Ome
gaven® will reach a bil irubin l evel ≤ 2 mg/dL faster than patients receiving conventional fat 
emulsions. Additionally, while patients receiving Omegaven ™ will experience a decrease in their levels of 
bil
irubin and other hepatic enzymes over time, patients receiving conventional emulsions will maintain 
hig
h levels of bilirubin and other hepatic enzymes over time.  
2.2 – Patients with surgical gastrointestinal disease and cholestasis will have better clinical hepatic 
outcome
s than patients receiving conventional emulsions. 
2.3 – Since patients receiving Omegaven® will have improved immune function, they will have a lower 
infe
ction rate then patients receiving conventional fat emulsions. 
2.4 – Due to a better general hepatic condition, patients receiving Omegaven® will also experience lower 
occurrence of liver transplant, death from hepatic associated causes, and blood transfusions.    
2. Background and Significance
Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) 
Parenteral nutrition (PN) provides intravenous nutritional supplementation for patients unable to absorb 
adequate enteral nutrients secondary to insufficient intestinal length or function. PN contains the 
macronutrient building blocks of the human diet in their most elemental forms (amino acids and dextrose) 
and is commonly administered with a fat emulsion to avoid essential fatty acid deficiency and to provide a 
c
alorically dense source of non-protein calories. In addition, PN contains the essential micronutrients 
(electrolytes, trace elements, and vitamins) to provide an optimal nutritional regimen. Before the 
development of PN in the late 1960’s, patients with insufficient gastrointestinal absorptive function 
commonly died of starvation and subsequent complications of malnutrition(1, 2). Today, more than 30,000 
patients are permanently dependent on parenteral nutrition for survival. However, PN continues to be 
associated with hepatic injury that occurs at an unpredictable rate and includes both biochemical, i.e., 
elevated serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, and histologic alterations such as steatosis, 
steatohepatitis, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215], cholestasis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis (3, 4). These abnormalities, which may  worsen 
with the duration  of PN administration, is more prevalent in the pediatric population. Additional risk 
factors for this condition include prematurity, low birth weight, long-term use of PN, the lack of 
concomitant enteral intake, sepsis, and multiple operative procedures (5). 
Although the pathological features of  PNALD have been well described, the etiology, prevention, and 
tre
atment of this complication are not well understood. Multiple hypotheses exist to explain the 
pathogenesis of PNALD including altered gut hormonal profiles (6), the propensity for bacterial 
translocati
on in the absence of enteral intake (7, 8), intestinal stasis resulting in the reduced clearance of 
hepatotoxic bile acids (8), and direct deficiencies or toxic components of the PN solution itself resulting in 
excessive glucose calorie uptake, excessive lipid infusion, or nutritional deficiencies such as essential fatty 
acid deficiency (9-11). None of these theories has been confirmed consistently. The etiology of PNALD is 
c
urrently considered multifactorial. Available treatment options for this disease process are limited and 
have achieved moderate success at best. Care of the PN-dependent patient is focused on gradually 
increasing enteral caloric intake as the residual bowel adapts allowing  PN to be discontinued  (12).  In

Role of Intravenous Fat Emulsion on PN Associated Liver Disease 
 
Recent evidence demonstrates that lipi[INVESTIGATOR_632628]. Enteral lipi[INVESTIGATOR_370091] a 
micelle and packaged into chylomicrons which are released into the portal venous system for ultimate 
uptake and disposal in the liver. Once in the bloodstream, these particles rapi[INVESTIGATOR_370092]-density lipoproteins and can subsequently be metabolized by [CONTACT_4852]. The 
emulsified particles of commercially made and intravenously administered lipid emulsions, such as 
Intralipid®, mimic the size and structure of chylomicrons, but differ in their content. In contrast to 
chylomicrons, artificial lipid particles primarily contain essential fatty acids and omega-[ADDRESS_844717], it appears that they may be cleared as whole particles by [CONTACT_309622].(16) These factors may account for the increased incidence of steatohepatitis associated with the 
intravenous administration of Intralipid®. 
 
The mechanism of clearance of omega-3 fatty acid containing lipid emulsions is unknown, but appears to 
be largely independent of the pathways identified above (17). Furthermore, omega-[ADDRESS_844718] been shown to decrease de novo lipogenesis (18), prevent or attenuate PN-induced hepatosteatosis in 
rats (19) and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_370093]-fat diet-induced hepatosteatosis in rats (20). 
In addition, omega-[ADDRESS_844719] of inflammation (18, 21).

This murine model of enteral PN-induced steatohepatitis is largely due to a high carbohydrate 
load and essential fatty acid deficiency. Although this model is not replicative of the clinical setting, it is a 
model that maximizes liver steatosis. In this model, mice are treated with oral PN for 19 days before being 
sacrificed. These animals develop severe fatty liver changes demonstrated by [CONTACT_632659] (H&E, PAS, and oil red O staining), and also have biochemical changes consistent with liver 
injury (elevated alkaline phosphatase and serum transaminases). Experimental groups were supplemented 
with Intralipid® by [CONTACT_309626], intravenously, and subcutaneously. 
Othe
r groups were also supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids (Omegaven®) by [CONTACT_632660].  In this study we found a consistent pattern of protection against PN-associated 
steatohepatitis by [CONTACT_309628]® (22). In mice that received the highest dose of enteral 
I
ntralipid®, there was a marked decrease in the extent of overall liver injury as measured by [CONTACT_632661], histologic analysis, liver fat content, and serum liver enzyme levels. In all areas of this 
investigation, mice treated with enteral lipid most closely resembled the control mice that did not receive 
PN as part of the experimental protocol. These results were in complete contrast to the extensive fatty 
infiltration and evidence of hepatic injury found in mice that received PN without lipid supplementation as 
well as in mice that received PN with intravenous Intralipid®. Mice receiving intravenous Intralipid® had 
the most
 severe liver changes.  Both groups of animals developed marked hepatic steatosis with 
macrovesicular fatty infiltration and significant elevations in spectroscopic liver fat content and serum 
transaminase levels. In addition, the effect of enteral Intralipid® supplementation appeared to be dose-
de
pendent; mice receiving one-third the dose of enteral Intralipid® showed improved liver histology but 
sti
ll demonstrated a moderate degree of liver injury by [CONTACT_370118]. The 
nutritional model employed in this study provided all experimental mice with enteral PN solution ad 
libitum . In this way, mice were not force-fed PN and self-regulated their PN intake by [CONTACT_632662]. Importantly, all mice gained weight throughout the 19-day protocol, and there were no 
differences in weight gain parameters between the groups. The PN solution was a typi[INVESTIGATOR_632629] 20% dextrose and 2% amino acids. Each milliliter of this 
formula provides 0.2 g (0.68 kilocalories) of dextrose and 0.02 g (0.08 kilocalories) amino acid. As the 
daily intake per animal of PN averaged 15 ml, mice were ingesting approximately 11.4 kilocalories/day 
a
nd 456 kilocalories/kg/day. This caloric load is similar to the established dietary energy needs of the 
mouse (23). The parenteral fat source used in this study was Intralipid® 20% (Baxter, Deerfield, Illinois), 
whic
h is a soybean oil-based emulsion. Each milliliter of this emulsion contains 0.2 g (2.0 kcal) of fat. We 
recognize that the model may not completely match the clinical, human, setting of intravenous PN-
administration; however, our goal was to produce a fatty liver with biochemical evidence of injury. Please 
refer to the attached paper from Pediatric Research  that discusses our findings in greater detail. 
  
I
n a second set of experiments, the same murine model was used to determine whether Omegaven® 
(Fresenius- Kabi, Bad Homburg, [LOCATION_013]), a commercial fish oil fat emulsion available in Europe, would 
pr
event fatty liver changes by [CONTACT_370119], and to determine the serum 
fatt
y acid profile of these animals. Animals receiving Omegaven® via the oral and intravenous routes had 
c
ompletely normal livers on histology and MRI spectroscopy revealed normal liver fat content. Liver 
func
tions tests in orally treated animals were also within the norm, while there were minimal elevations in 
intravenously treated groups. There was no fatty acid deficiency in these groups as determined by [CONTACT_632663] (5,8,11-Eicosatrienoic acid) levels in the serum fatty acid analysis. Mead acid is the only 
polyunsaturated fatty acid of note produced de  novo  by [CONTACT_632664]. Furthermore, arachidonic acid levels were low in Omegaven® treated 
animals consistent with previous reports. In a third set of experiments, mice were made severely fatty acid 
deficient. These mice were treated for 10 days with Omegaven® and had complete reversal of their fatty 
acid deficiency.

Similarly, other investigators studied livers in a newborn pig model and showed that intravenous 
administration of fish oil, which consists primarily of omega-3 fatty acids, reduced parenteral nutrition-
induced cholestasis (22). However, the study was only [ADDRESS_844724] regime of nutritional support by [CONTACT_309634].  It has 
been thought that reduction of an essential fatty acid, such as omega-6, during long-term therapy would 
re
sult in fatty acid deficiency and deterioration of the health of the patient. Our experience to date, as 
discusse
d below, demonstrates that the use of Omegaven® as monotherapy does not result in the 
development of essential fatty acid deficiency and it can actually be used to as monotherapy to treat this 
deficiency state.   
 
Preliminary Safety and Efficacy Data for Use of Omegaven® in Other Diseases 
 
Omegaven® has been used for over [ADDRESS_844725] to conventional fat emulsions.  According to 
current data, an increase in the proportion of omega-3 fatty acids is thought to optimize nutrition in 
general, but in particular benefit patients whose underlying disease might benefit from an increase in 
omega
-3 fatty acids.  An adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids results in anti-inflammatory and 
im
munomodulatory effects that are protective in nature from inflammatory tissue damage, capi[INVESTIGATOR_370097], and improved immunological resistance. It may also reduce the risk of thrombosis and 
incr
ease microvascular perfusion due to its anti-aggregatory and vasodilatory effects. 
 
In Europe and Asia, the use of parenteral omega-3 fatty acids has been used in the following adult patient 
populations (24-28): 
 post traumatic and post surgical patients 
 patients experiencing early stages of sepsis/SIRS 
 patients at risk of hyperinflammatory processes 
 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis)  
 patients with inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, atopic eczema) 
 
The dosing used in these patients was 0.1 g (1ml) to a maximum of 0.2 (2ml) /kg body weight. The 
infusion rate used did not exceed 0.5ml/kg/body weight/hour.  Since it was intended to be infused in 
combination with conventional fat emulsions, the total fat intake was limited to 10-20% as fish oil.  The 
dura
tion of administration did not exceed 4 weeks. 
 
Preliminary Safety and Efficacy Data for Use of Omegaven® in Infants 
 
P
ediatric experience with Omegaven® is limited to 2 unpublished clinical trials (see appendix).  These 
trials we
re performed in [LOCATION_013] and Taiwan (29). The German study was a controlled, randomized, 
open parallel-group clinical study to investigate whether or not omega-3 fatty acids could be incorporated 
into the plasma phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_309594].  In this 7-day safety trial, 
Omegaven® use was evaluated on the basis of clinical, laboratory, and antioxidant parameters and lipid 
meta
bolism. Treatment was started on day 3-5 of life and continued for a total of 7 days. Patients received 
Ome
gaven® plus conventional soybean fat emulsion or soybean emulsion alone.  The maximum dose of 
Ome
gaven® in the study was 0.2 gm/kg/day.  The study concluded that the Omegaven® was well tolerated 
in t
his group of preterm infants in respect to both hematological and biochemical parameters. The 
incidence of reported adverse events between both study groups was similar. The eicosapentaenoic acid

treatment arm. 
 
The Taiwanese study was a single center, controlled, open-labeled study conducted to investigate the 
safety of parenteral administration of Omegaven® in preterm infants. The group of 20 infants were 
randomized to one of two treatment groups; one consisting of Omegaven®/conventional lipi[INVESTIGATOR_370100].  The average dose of Omegaven® in the treatment group of 
thi
s 14-day study was 0.13 + 0.02 g/kg/day.  There were no significant differences between the two groups 
with regard to body weight and length. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the hematological

e
nsure adequate caloric intake, additional non-protein calories were provided as parenteral carbohydrates 
(as dextrose).  No other parenteral form of fat emulsion was administered during Omegaven® therapy.  His

not be know
n at the time of enrollment and will not preclude them from continuing in the study. For the 
sake of statistical analysis, however, these patients will be excluded although all data will be collected and 
re
viewed.  
 
Screening Procedures 
 
All patients receiving parenteral nutrition are followed by [CONTACT_632665].  Eligibility for 
the trial will be discussed on rounds. Prior historical and physical information, imaging studies, biopsies, 
and other available specialized tests will be reviewed by [CONTACT_309640]. Additional biochemical monitoring 
will be perfomed as necessary. If the patient’s status supports consideration of treatment, the option for 
non-experimental therapy will be investigated. A similar process will be utlized for self-referrals and 
potential patients referred from distant healthcare facilities. 
USoybean based Fat Emulsion (Intralipid® and/or Liposyn®) 
The conventional PN comparison group will be selected from patients previously studied by [CONTACT_632667].(31) We will study the subset of those patients whose recorded direct bilirubin was ever > 2 mg/dL. 
Information about these patients will be extracted from the Excel database used for this study and 
provided to us by [CONTACT_1758]’s Princip al Investigator, [CONTACT_632690].  A request for research

A second analysis will be done using more contemporary historical controls from patients receiving 
conventional PN  This will include 50 patients (approximately 10 per year) retrospectively enrolled and 
previously treated with soybean based emulsions from 1999-2004. Subjects will be selected among patients 
with surgical gastrointestinal diseases and will have been expected to need PN for 30 days or more at the

Subjects for the Andorsky et al. study were identified based on: 1) International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision code of 579.3 (post-surgical malabsorption, commonly used to code short bowel 
s
yndrome); 2) review of the list of patients receiving PN at home who were followed by [CONTACT_632672]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724]; and 3) survey of attending surgeons, gastroenterologis ts, 
and nutrition physicians at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7724].  
Soybean  based fat emulsion patients will initially be identified by [CONTACT_632665], Pharmacy 
bi
lling, and clinical laboratory records. We will at first seek all patients that received PN between 1999 and 
2004. Subjects will then be selected based on ever presenting with cholestasis (based on direct bilirubin 
records). After that, we will apply the inclusion criteria to the patient’s record at the moment that cholestasis is 
characterized. To further assure comparability between the two groups, we will also base identification of 
patients for inclusion in the control group by: 1) International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 
of 579.3 (post-surgical malabsorption, commonly used to code short bowel syndrome); 2) review of the list of 
patients receiving PN at home who were followed by [CONTACT_632673]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_398313]; and 3) review of the list of patients followed by [CONTACT_632674]

 d. Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors 
UTREATMENTS U™ 
Omega-3 Fat Emulsion (Omegaven®) 
Bottles containing 50mL or 100 mL of 10% Omegaven® will be purchased from International Pharmacy 
of Hamburg, [LOCATION_013] or directly from the manufacturer. Approval was received from the FDA in March 
2007 to allow for
 billing of Omegaven®. In the event that third party coverage is not available Children's 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011] will cover all drug costs for patients enrolled in this protocol.   Omegaven® is 
manuf
actured by [CONTACT_309642], Bad Homburg v.d.h, [LOCATION_013]. Omegaven® is formulated as an 
emulsion from fish oils  
 
While inpatient, the emulsion for all patients will be repacked into syringes to allow for administration via 
s
yringe pump.  However, if patients require over 100ml (10g) of Omegaven®, they will receive the 
medic
ation  via bottles.  If patients are to be discharged home on Omegaven®, all doses will be 
administered from the origin al manufacturer’s container.  
 
All study materials will be stored securely until the time of administration. The bottles will be stored at 
room temperature below 30° C (do not freeze). Damaged or suspect drug will be returned unused to 
Fresenius- Kabi. Containers should be shaken before use.

dispensed, to whom dispensed, returned drug and drug lost or damaged. At the end of the study, all used 
and unused Omegaven® will be accounted for.  If expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], the remaining drug supplies will be destroyed. 
 
Details of Omegaven® Administration 
 
Af
ter baseline labs are obtained (Tables 2 and 3), therapy with Omegaven® will be initiated at the goal 
dose of 1 gram /kg/day and is infused over 8-24 hours, so long as the infusion rate does not exceed 
0.15g
/kg/hour.  Ome gaven® will be infused intravenously through either a central or peripheral catheter 
alone or in conjunction with parenteral nutrition.  If additional fat calories are needed, they will be 
provided via the enteral route. The same standards of care provided to all patients receiving parenteral 
nutrition solution will be followed. Routine nutritional monitoring is described in Table 3. 
 
I
n the event that a patient is unable to achieve adequate calories parenterally and is unable to tolerate 
enteral feeds, it may be necessary to evaluate whether or not the patient should continue the study with 
Omegaven® as monotherapy or resume therapy with conventional fat emulsions so that additional 
parenteral fat calories can be given. The clinical team, in conjunction with the patient's primary physician, 
will determine if the patient should be removed from the protocol. The DSMB will also be notified.   
 
Orders for Omegaven® will be written on a CHB PN order form and must contain the following data 
elements: 
 Tota l daily dose to administered in mL 
 The hourly infusion rate (total daily dose ÷ the number of hours to be infused) 
Prior to the administration of each Omegaven® dose, two nurses will check the dose dispensed against the 
physician’s orders and verify that the infusion pump settings (hourly rate, volume to be infused) are 
correct before the infusion is started. 
 
As previously mentioned, Omegaven® may be infused in the same manner as conventional fat emulsions 
throug
h either a central or peripheral line. The emulsion is isotonic. It is compatible with parenteral 
nutrition solutions and may be co-infused via y-site. Per Infection Control, source containers must be 
changed every [ADDRESS_844739] discarded. Omegaven® may be infused through a 1.2micron 
inl
ine filter. 
 
 
Dose Modification 
 
Lipid Intolerance 
 
If lipid intolerance develops, defined as serum triglyceride levels > 200 mg/dL, the following will be 
c
onsidered prior to reducing the dose: 
 
a) If the level was obtained while the patient was receiving a continuous 24-hour infusion of Omegaven®, 
the total dose should be infused over 20 hours, and a repeat serum triglyceride level obtained prior to 
resuming the infusion 4 hours later.

High Glucose Infusion Rate 
 
Subjects with a high glucose infusion rate (GIR) will have a dose increase up to 1.5 grams/kg/day to allow 
for a reduction in PN calories from carbohydrates at the discretion of the Omegaven study team and the 
nutrition service. 
 
Duration of Therapy 
 
Patients will remain on Omegaven® until weaned from PN. Patients may continue monotherapy with 
Ome
gaven® as an additional source of calories after the dextrose/protein portion of PN is discontinued 
 
I
n the event that a patient who has been listed for a liver or liver/intestinal transplant has an organ become 
available, the participation in this protocol will not preclude them from receiving the transplant. 
 
Disruption of Therapy 
 
In event that Omegaven® cannot be administered (i.e. loss of central venous catheter access, fluid 
re
strictions, need to administer an incompatible medication/blood product), the infusion of Omegaven® 
may be interrupted and resumed when the conflicting situation is resolved. Some potential interventions 
that can be used include:  
 
Situation  Possible  Solution  
Loss of central venous access  Administer via peripheral route  
Fluid restriction  Consult with pharmacy to concentrate PN, 
medications to allow for administration  
Limited access, need to administer 
incompatible medications  Stop Omegaven® infusio n, flush catheter with 
either NS or dextrose, administer incompatible 
medication, flush catheter, resume infusion; may 
be necessary to infuse Omegaven® over 8 -24 
hours. Multiple syringes should be used  so as to 
keep maximum hang time of Omegaven® source 
container less than 12 hours)  Regardless of the 
infusion time, the infusion rate  cannot exceed 
0.15g/kg/hour .  
 
 
 
Discontinuation of Therapy 
 
Patients will continue to be followed by [CONTACT_632674] (CAIR) 
Program upon discontinuation of therapy with Omegaven® for a minimum of 2 months after the treatment 
is s
topped.

Soybean based Fat Emulsion (Intralipid® and/or Liposyn®) 
 
Subjects in the Andorsky et al cohort received one of two commercially available intravenous fat 
emulsions (IFE), Liposyn® II or Intralipid®. IFE is provided as an oil- in-water emulsion derived from egg 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], soybean or safflower oils and glycerol. Although three concentrations are commercially 
available (10, 20, 30%) only the 10 and 20% concentrations have been approved for use in children. Both 
Liposyn® II and Intralipid® contain soybean oils.  Table [ADDRESS_844743] used, doses less than 96 ml/day were repacked into syringes to allow for 
administration via syringe pump.  Doses greater than 96ml/day were dispensed in the original 
manufacturer’s container. If patients were discharged home on either IFE, all doses were administered 
fr
om the original manufacturer’s container.  
 
For either brand, IFE was typi[INVESTIGATOR_632636] a low rate and advanced as tolerated.  In the Andorsky et al 
c
ohort, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_632637] 0.5 - 1 g/kg/day that was advanced in increments of 
0.5 g
/kg/day until a goal of 3 g/kg/day is reached, provided that it did not exceed 60% of total calories. 
Larger neonates usually received initial doses of 1 - 2 gm/kg/day. To improve tolerance, IFE was infused 
ove
r 24 hours.  Prior to initiating fat emulsions lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], serum triglyceride levels were checked and then 
moni
tored to assess tolerance.  Tolerance was typi[INVESTIGATOR_632638] < 200 mg/dL.  Once 
a goal regimen was reached (not to exceed 60% of total calories) serum triglycerides were checked 
weekly. 
 
Dose Modification 
 
As most serum triglyceride levels are checked while IFE was infusing, it was common practice  for 
patients who appeared unable to tolerate IFE, to hold the IFE infusion for  [ADDRESS_844744] elevated serum triglycerides including 
acute phase stress response and sepsis. Some practitioners opted to reduce the dose or discontinue IFE 
during acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_64507], RDS, thrombocytopenia, or severe hyperbilirubinemia (i.e., approaching 
exchange level). Provided that the serum triglyceride was < 200 mg/dL, a minimum of 2-4 % of non-
protein calories was administered as fat (approximately 0.5 g/kg/day) to provide sufficient essential fats to 
prevent essential fatty acid deficiency.

ADDITIONAL PREDICTORS OF INTERE ST 
 
Since decisions about starting Omegaven® administration will follow a compassionate protocol, we expect 
that pa
tients receiving Omegaven® will present more severe liver disease than the controls from the 
hist
orical cohort. Therefore, to correct confounding biases, we anticipate the need to adjust for potential 
pr
edictors of liver outcomes at baseline. Baseline will be defined as: the date that treatment starts for 
Ome
gaven® patients and on the date that patient reached bilirubin levels > 2 for soybean based fat 
e
mulsion patients. 
 
 
The following predictors of liver disease will be considered: 
 
- Baseline direct bilirubin levels. 
- Diagnosis of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (vs. any other disease) 
- Gender (male vs. female) 
- Age (≥ 8 months vs. < 8 months)  
- Gestational age 
- Birth weight 
- Race  
 
To assess patients comparability, we will also descriptively explore trends in direct bilirubin level before 
the beginning of follow-up (start of treatement date for Omegaven® patients and date in which direct 
bil
irubin level raised to > 2 mg/dL for control patients)   
 
Subgroup Analysis  
 
With exploratory purposes, we will describe safety and/or efficacy of Omegaven® in subgroups of patients 
including younger (vs. older) patients at baseline, patients who presented with infections (vs. who did not),

Secondary Fatty Acid Analysis on Red Blood Cell Membranes 
 
Utilizing the waste we draw off central line blood draws and discard for our current protocol, it is our 
intention to store this usually discarded sample without any identifiers and use them for a fatty acid 
analysis on the red blood cell membrane. As a routine part of our protocol we look at “free fatty acids” in 
the blood but t
his only yields limited information. This analysis will allow us to examine the fatty acid 
composition of the red blood cell membranes which is significantly influenced by [CONTACT_632676] [ADDRESS_844749] de-identified discarded blood samples for lipid derivatives of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty 
acids. The measurement of the small molecules involved in lipid pathways is termed "lipi[INVESTIGATOR_1800]." Insight 
into changes in lipid production may be critical to understanding the pathophysiology of parenteral 
nutrition-associated liver disease and understanding the therapeutic benefit of fish oil-based lipid 
emulsions. We would like to send de- identifi ed discard blood to a collaborator at UC-Berkeley who can 
pe
rform a "lipi[INVESTIGATOR_1854]" analysis of the serum. This analysis details the lipid mediator composition in the 
blood. The discard blood (specifically serum) will be sent to [CONTACT_632692], Associate Professor of 
Visi
on Science and Optometry; Solon M. and Pearl A. Braff Chair in Clinical Optometric Science; Center 
for Eye Disease & Development, UC Berkeley. [CONTACT_632693] is one of the few investigators in the world 
who has the expertise to quantify some of the specific lipid mediators of interest in this study. 
e. Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints 
 
Generally, primary safety analyses will be based on time from baseline or [ADDRESS_844750] bilirubin levels < 2mg/dL. Baseline will be defined as 
information collected at the date that treatment starts for Omegaven® patients and on the date that patient 
reached bilirubin levels > 2 for soybean oil fat emulsion patients. Information on mortality and transplant 
will
 be collected during the whole treatment with Omegaven® and during the whole period for which we 
have data available in the Andorsky et al. dataset. Primary efficacy analysis will include time from 
baseline until the patient normalizes bilirubin (presents three  consecutive direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL  or a 
direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL and weaned from TPN) . With exploratory purpose, we will also describe the 
curve of the several markers for the entire period that Andorsky et al. recorded data.  
 
Outc
ome/Endpoints 
 
1. Treatment safety 
 
Our primary outcome for treatment safety will be based on patient’s essential fatty acid profile . We will 
compare patients before treatment with Omegaven® started and after treatment started (one month after 
treatment started until treatment stopped ) with re spect to the frequency with which triene/tetraene ratio > 
0.2 at an
y time. We will also compare the occurrence any event of of hypertriglyceridimia (serum 
trig
lyceride  > 400 mg/dL) between Omegaven® and soybean oil fat emulsions. Primary analyses for these 
a
nd all other safety outcomes will be based on a follow-up time for Omegaven® and soybean oil fat 
e
mulsions starting 30 days after baseline, i.e., 30 days after treatment started for Omegaven® patients and 
[ADDRESS_844751] bilirubin level < 2 mg/dL was recorded. We will also explore comparisons 
including the time from baseline unti l the end of follow -up period.

/tetraene ratios, triglycerides,  total omega-6 fatty acids, total omega-3 fatty acids, total saturated, 
total monounsaturated, and total polysaturated fatty acids). Specific fatty acids such as  arachidonic, 
palmoteleic, palmitic, oleic, stearic, and linoleic fatty acids will also be evaluated and described. Also, for 
exploratory purposes, we will compare the trend in weight- and height-for-age Z-scores between both 
g
roups.

f.  Data Collection Methods, Assessments and Schedule  
Omega-3 Fat Emulsion (Omegaven ™) 
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_978] (MP), the  managing  co-investi gator (KG) , and the clinical coordinator 
with the assistance of the nursing unit liaisons and research assistants in [CONTACT_632691]’s laboratory   Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632640] t clinical information. Results of liver biopsies and blood chemistries 
will be obtained from  PowerChart within the Cerner computer system  a t CHB .  Specifically, the history of 
present illness, past medical history, and birth history, pertinent physical ex am findings including patient 
weight, the results of liver biopsies, and parenteral and enteral feeding history will be collected. The 
information will be recorded on hard copy data collection forms.  
 
Soybean based Fat Emulsion (Intralipid® and/or Liposyn®) 
Data will be extracted  from the Excel spread sheet used to stor e data of the  Andorsky et al. study. 
Additionally, we will obtain information about date of birth (to estimate age at each visit and nutritional 
safety outcomes) and blood transfusion s in Power Chart  within the Cerner computer system  at CHB . In 
the original study performed by [CONTACT_624150]., data was abstracted from charts , nursing flowsheets (for 
nutritional intake data) , and outpatient visit notes  in two week intervals.

This study will end when  the results of a n FDA approved clinical trial proves Omegaven® treatment to be 
ineffective or the  product is approved for use in the [LOCATION_002]. The investigators proposal to the 
Orphan Products Grants Program o f FDA  submitted in spring 2007 which was accepted.   
h. Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures 
Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and reported from the time of the first Omegaven® infusion until 
e
xit from the study in accordance with CHB Committee on Clinical Investigations (CCI) reporting 
re
quirements. In particular, the patient will be observed during and shortly after Omegaven® 
a
dministration for the occurrence of anaphylactic or allergic reactions.  Other expected adverse events 
include death, blood stream infection; transfer to ICU for treatment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_632641]; re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624136], dehydration, 
elec
trolyte abnormalities, catheter malfunctions, bowel obstructions, and urinary tract infection.  
Unexpected adverse events will also be assessed and reported in compliance with the CHB CCI 
requirements. Patients experiencing any adverse events that are moderate or severe in nature and that may 
be
 related to Omegaven® will have their treatment temporarily halted until the adverse event has resolved. 
Dose modifications will occur as described above.If a dose reduction is made  for adverse events later 
c
onsidered to be unrelated to Omegaven®, the O megaven® dose will be increased back to the dose 
prescribed prior to the dose reduction..  Patients with anaphylactic or allergic reactions will not continue 
Omegaven® treatment. 
 
An
y serious or unsuspected adverse events will be reported to the Committee on Clinical Investigation 
(CCI) and the FDA  within 72 hours.of the occuranceof being known, or immediately if the event is fatal 
or li
fe threatening as per Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632642]. This will be done in person, by [CONTACT_756], or email,  and by 
c
ompletion of the CCI's form for adverse/unexpected event reporting. 
 
Adverse events are detected by  [CONTACT_632677] 
c
are services including the routine monitoring of vital signs and daily physical exam data.   Adverse 
eve
nts identified by [CONTACT_632678] [INVESTIGATOR_632643], and subsequently to the appropriate board or committee. 
 
A Committee of the Study Investigators  (Drs. Puder, Gura, and Duggan) will be responsible for assuring 
that a
dverse event reporting requirements are actually met. The Investigator Committee will meet not less 
than monthl
y to conduct clinical case reviews of all patients receiving Omegaven® to review recruitment 
da
ta, adverse events and protocol deviations; and to evaluate overall safety of Omegaven® therapy.  CHB 
Staff dieticians caring for Omegaven® patients will participate in the Investigator meetings as necessary.   
An
y patients who have agreed to participate in the trial, but who have not yet undergone intervention, will 
be informed of adverse events. A revised consent document will be submitted to the CCI with the adverse 
e
vent form for reviewand approval. All adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_632644], probably, possibly, or unrelated to administration of study drug 
 
Patients will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following: 
 
a) Toxicity considered unacceptable by [CONTACT_100615]

5. Data Management and Statistical Analysis  
a. Data Management Methods 
Ove
rview 
All clinical and laboratory research data will be abstracted from source documents (medical records) and 
recorded and maintained on study specific case report forms (CRF).  These CRFs will be stored within 
individual subject binders in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Standards and FDA requirements. 
Study materials will be kept in the Principal Investigator ’s locked office and access will be restricted to 
authorized study staff only.  Subject confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_370125]-specific data 
using a unique confidential study identifier. 
 
Staff from the Clinical Research Program (CRP) at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632645] 
I
nvestigators (Drs. Puder and Gura) and Study Coordinator to manage the study data. CRP staff has 
e
xtensive experience in the design, conduct and management of clinical trials data.   
 
Protocol Management and Protocol Status 
 
The data management system for the Omegaven® Compassionate-Use protocol is currently programmed as  
Redcap, a free and secure web-based application designed to support electronic data capture for research 
studies..  Redcap provides a simple point-and- clic k interface to create web-based case report forms with the 
ability to customize real-time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), maintain project audit 
trails, export project data to advanced statistical software packages and assign different levels of data access for 
each member of the research team.  Redcap will support cross-sectional and longitudinal research designs.  
Redcap was developed by a multi-institutional consortium initiated at Vanderbilt University.  Each institution is 
responsible for hosting a separate instance of Redcap in a manner that is consistent with all local policies and 
procedures. This configuration allows the host institution to define Redcap data security policies, data backup 
schedules, data retention plans and involvement of necessary departments in the Redcap project creation process 
(IRB, Human Subject Protection Organization, Clinical Research Center, Office of Business Conduct, etc…)   
Only authorized users are permitted to access data and daily server backup procedures are executed to ensure 
system reliability and data recovery. 
b. Quality Control Method  
Study Conduct 
 
Several QA procedures will be implemented to promote and monitor compliance with study protocols and 
procedures and allow timely reporting of protocol deviations.  
 
1.  Case Report Forms (CRFs) : An offical document review and sign-off process will be established to 
guarantee all critical primary and secondary outcome measures are included on the CRFs.  In additon, 
CRFs will be designed to incorporate clearly specified definitions and simple instructions to data 
collectors to minimize data collection errors.

Procedures Manuals : Written data collection, data manamgment and data entry procedures will 
emphasize timely data capture in relation to real time events including actual clinical and laboratory 
measurements.  
 
3.  Clinical Data Manag ement System :  
The REDCap clinical data management system will be used for data entry.  REDCap (Research Electronic 
Da
ta Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, 
providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation 
and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical 
packages; and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources.  
 
 
4.  Staff Training :  A training program will be developed and delivered to CHB clinical staff to review 
the aims of the Omegaven® compassionate-use protocol, review standard care clinical protocedures, 
protocol-specific clinical and laboratory measurement procedures, and procedures for when and how to 
contact [CONTACT_978]. Training will be coordinated by [CONTACT_632679] (MP) and Co- PI (KG). Where possible, training components will be offered as Net Learning 
Modules. 
 
5.  Omegaven® Administration:  C HB nursing staff will be instructed to adopt the following special 
procedures for Omegaven® administration to prevent administration errors for patients residing in CHB 
c
linical care units, e.g. NICU, MICU, etc. 
 The dose, rate, and pump settings will be confirmed by 2 nurses prior to the start of the infusion. 
 The double check will be documented on the flow sheets, power chart or eclypsys in the same 
manner as the documentation required for blood product administration. 
 The physician orders will be written beyond the standard care requirement to include the primary 
Omegaven® dose calculations of total volume to be infused over 8-24 hours as well as the hourly 
infusion ra
te so that no primary calculations will be required by [CONTACT_60397].  
 
A limited tolerance for deviations in Omegaven® dosing will be allowed to accommodate expected 
variations that commonly occur when providing standard clinical care of pediatric patients receiving 
nutritional supplements including essential fatty acids.   For example, in cases where patients are also 
prescribed medications that are incompatible with Omegaven®, (e.g. morphine) dosing may vary up to a 
1.5 hour
 dose equivalent. Omegaven® infusion may also be stopped / postponed when a patient goes for 
spec
ial diagnostic studies or procedures or therapeutic treatments. An Omegaven® dose range will be 
established for protocol deviation reporting such that Omegaven® dosing will be set at target (1 gram of 
Ome
gaven® per kilogram of body weight per day) plus or minus a 1.5 hour dose equivalent. Dosing 
va
riations that exceed the tolerance range will be reported to the CCI as protocol deviations.   
 
6. Specimen Collection/Laboratory Testing / Laboratory results data capture:   
All laboratory studies captutred for the Omegaven® compassinate use protocol are considered standard 
care laboratory tests for this patient population. No additonal QA procedures will be established beyond 
the QA procedures already established as CHB standard operating procedures for patient care, specimen 
collection, processing, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_632646].  If specimens are not drawn on schedule, if 
specimen volume is insufficient, or if specimen are contaminated or destroyed such that laboratory test 
results are missing or deemed invalid for any reason, laboratory values will be recorded as missing on the 
labor
atory CRFs and in the CDMS.  If any of the following laboratory values are missing at baseline or for 
2 consecutive cycles, a report of a protocol deviation will be reported to the CCI and DSMB:

7. Data Capture:  
The study nurses will abstract the medical records and complete the CRFs. The study coordinator will 
provide a careful QC visual inspection of the CRFs prior to submiting them for data entry. CRFs will be 
inspec
ed for completeness and out of range values. The Research Coordinator will complete all data entry.  
The selected CRFs will undergo 100% verification against source documentation (medical records, 
laboratory data, etc).

a
ll correspondence with the FDA and I RB 
c. Pharmacy files including drug shipment, dispensing, and accountability records, and pharmacy-
related correspondence 
 
Per FDA regulations, the Primary Investigator will retain records for a period of  five (5)  years following 
discontinuation of the study. 
 
Data Quality and Completeness 
 
Allowable ranges were created for each variable of interest and records outside of those ranges were 
checked.  
c. Data Analysis Plan 
Using graphical methods (including boxplots) and descriptive statistics, we will asse ss assumptions 
required for validity of statistical methods and presence of outliers. Continuous variables will be 
summ
arized via means (and standard deviations) or medians (and interquartile ranges, when appropriate. 
When appropriate varibles will be transformed.  
 
Primary analyses of the primary outcome will be be based on the intention- to- treat analysis i.e., patient 
will
 be considered receiving either omegaven® or soybean based emulsions throughout the whole follow-
up pe
riod, regardless of temporary discontinuation of treatment due to infections or other causes. 
 
Analysis of Baseline Characteristics 
For statistical pursposes, baseline values will be defined as the last measurement before starting to 
administer Omegaven® for patients,  in the treatment group,  and as the measurement taken when a patient 
first had a direct bilirubin level > 2 mg/dL recorded, in the historical control group. Descriptive statistics 
for all baseline relevant risk factors will be summarized for Omegaven® (omega-3 based fat emulsion) and 
hist
orical control (soybean oil fat emulsion) groups. Associations between categorical predictors and 
Ome
gaven® vs. soybean oil fat emulsion groups will be tested through chi-square tests. Associations 
be
tween continuous predictors and treatment groups will be studied through means (and standard 
deviations) and t-tests, or medians (and interquartile ranges) and Wilcoxon tests, when appropriate. 
 
Analysis of Safety and Tolerability of Omegaven®

All primary safety and tolerability analyses will be based on descriptive statistics. In secondary analyses, 
we will also assess the statistical significance of differences. Some safety and tolerability outcomes will be 
measured only in the Omegaven® group. For those, we will compare results before starting PN with 
O
megaven® (while receiving PN with soybean oil fat emulsions) with after starting PN with Omegaven®. 
The
 period receiving Omegaven® will start to be counted 30 days after beginning PN with Omegaven® for 
the main analysis. Outcomes measured in the O megaven® and soybean oil fat emulsion groups will be 
de
scribed separately for each of those groups for a period starting 30 days after baseline, i.e., 30 days after 
starting PN with Omegaven®, for the treatment group, and 30 days after bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, for the 
soybean oil fat emulsion group.  
 
P
rimary outcomes measured only in the Omegaven® group will include whether the triene/tetraene ratio 
wa
s ever > 0.2 during the intervention period and whether the  INR was ever > 2.  Secondary outcomes 
mea
sured only on the Omegaven® group will include platelets, prothrombin time (PT), partial 
thromboplastin time (PTT), and other components of the fatty acid profile. Analysis of all categorical 
outcomes will be based on proportions and of all continuous outcomes will be based on means or medians 
of the individual mean, maximum or minimum values, as appropriate, during the respective follow-up 
period. Comparisons between periods (pre and post-treatment) will be performed based on paired tests, 
parametric or non-parametric, as appropriate. We will also explore trends over time (e.g., decreasing for 
INR and increasing for pre-albumin) and estimate p-values via regression models using generalized 
estimating equations or random effects to account for within subject correlations. When describing 
outcome
s over time, we will explore the effect of predictors of poor hepatic outcomes, such as use of 
antifungal agents (e.g.., amphotericin) and antidiarrheal agents (e.g., loperamide), on potential spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988].   
 
P
rimary outcomes measured in the Omegaven® and soybean based fat emulsion groups will include 
whe
ther triglycerides were ever > 400mg/dL, whether albumin was ever > 3, any occurrence of 
une
xpected bleeding and number of times it occurred, occurrence of any anaphylatic reaction, rate of 
blood stream infections as shown by [CONTACT_239975], rate of line infections and gram positive 
central venous catheter infections. Outcomes will be summarized for each study group based proportions, 
poiss
on rates, mean, minimum, or maximum over the subject follow-up period, and statistical significance 
of differences between groups will be estimated with exploratory purpopose via Fisher ’s exact test , 
W
ilcoxon or t-tests, as appropriate.  
 
We will also compare nutritional outcomes of the two groups including difference in weight-for- age Z-
sc
ores and height-for-age Z-scores from baseline to the moment in which the child starts enteral feeding 
a
nd to the moment in which the child receives less than 10% of their calories from PN. Comparison 
be
tween study groups will be performed via t-test or Wilcoxon tests, as appopriate. Using linear 
regression, we will explore adjustement for baseline alternative predictors of interest. Trends over time in 
Z-scores will also be explored using regression with repeatemd measure methods. 
  
A
nalysis of Efficacy of Omegaven® 
 
The primary outcome to gain preliminary evidence of efficacy will be based on the time from baseline to 
normalization of bilirubin level, i.e, first time point among three consecutive in which bilirubin is < 2 
mg/d
L. We do not anticipate that any subject will present a rebound on direct bilirubin after normalization. 
However, we will describe the cohort with respect to the frequency of rebounds in bilirubin levels.

die or receive a liver transplant before bilirubin is normalized. Subjects who die before their bilirubin 
leve

nor
malize bilirubin) and were not censored before reaching the endpoint of interest. Results of these

W
e will also describe individual profiles over time (i.e., 2 months before before baseline or birth until end 
of follow-up period) for all subjects using graphical methods. Trends in liver function markers over time 
will be explored using generalized linear models in which correlations of observations within subjects will 
be accounted using a generalized equations or random effects approach. In these models we will 
hypothesize that for both groups biochemical levels increase for all tests with equal slope before 
treatement. After treatm ent, however, levels should be decreasing for patients in the Omegaven® group. 
W
e will perform these analyses including only subjects who did not die or under go transplantation an d 
including
 all subjects but assigning for subjects who died or underwent a transplant their worse possible 
outcome after they died or had the transplant. Using descriptive statistics, we will also explore the 
a
ssociation between spi[INVESTIGATOR_632647] s and blood stream infections.               
 
Asse
ssment of efficacy will be also based on comparison of means (or medians) of the mean and 
maximum modified PELD scores of each subject across all follow-up weeks. Adjustments of these 
c
omparisons for potential confounders will be based on linear regression models. Mean rates of infection 
will be compared using logrank and Cox proportional hazards models. Proportions of liver transplant, 
mortality, and red blood cell product transfusion events between the two groups will be compared via 
Fishe
r’s exact test (or Chi -square tests, when appropriate). Adjustments for potential confounders will be 
considered using exact stratified analysis and logistic regression models. 
 
Missing Values 
 
Since data will be prospectively collected in the Omegaven® group, we anticipate that data will be nearly 
complete, particularly for the safety outcomes. In both groups, we will explore imputing any laboratory 
va
lues that are missing up to two visits in the middle of the follow-up period using linear or non-linear 
int
erpolation, as appropriate. To interpolate direct and total bilirubin, we will primarely use the two closest 
observations, since bilirubin could be very different in points in time located further apart from the 
missi
ng observation. We will compare conclusions of analyses based on imputed values with analyses 
ba
sed on the available information.  
 
Potential Study Limitations 
 
The main limitation of our study results from the lack of comparability between the Omegaven® and 
hist
orical control groups leading to potential confounding bias es in our results. Two concerns could be: a) 
se
veral health care standards and reporting systems changed (possibly improved) over the last 25 years 
(pe
riod in which controls were enrolled) ; and b) Omegaven® cases may be more severe, with more

differences in safety (such as line infections) outcomes between Omegaven® (outcomes recorded now) 
a

ove
r time would tend to bias results in opposite direction, i.e., against Omegaven®. Sinc e both biases may 
occur, we would expect that they would reduce or cancel each other. Also, we will compare all safety 
outcomes before and after treatment started in patients receiving Omegaven®, a nd compare conclusions of 
these analyses with analyses comparing Omegaven® with historical controls. Biases due to differential

more importantly biases could result  from missing data, since more missing data is expected to occur in 
historical controls than in  the Omegaven® cohort (differential pattern of missing). Misclassification due to 
lack of specificity or sensitivity of  direct bilirubin as a marker of cholestasis would likely to be random, 
and thus lead to underestimation of the true effect of Omegaven® in reversal of cholestasis. Biases due to 
more outcomes missing in the control than in the Omegaven® group could lead t o an overestimation of  the 
effect of Omegaven® 
d. Statistical Power and Sample Considerations 
The
 number of subjects included in the Omegaven® group will be based on a compassionate use protocol 
and not on study power considerations. The number of subjects included in the soybean oil fat emulsion 
hist
orical cohort group will not be based on study power considerations but rather on the number of 
eligible subjects from a pre-existing cohort. 
 
The primary safety analysis will be descriptive and not based on statistical significance. However, in 
Table [ADDRESS_844766] several differences in the frequency of adverse events, assuming 20, 
25, or
 30 patients, diverse proportion of subjects with adverse event in either treatment period and not with 
the a
dverse event in the other (proportion of discordant pairs), for a two-sided 5% significance level 
McN
emar’s test s. Table 5 includes estimates of p ower for a Fisher’s exact test when comparing 
Omegaven® with historical control groups, assuming diverse frequency of occurrence of the adverse event 
in t
he control group, equal number of subjects in each group, and diverse differences in proportions 
be
tween Omegaven® and soybean oil fat emulsion groups.  
F
or lower proportions of discordant pairs, we would generall y attain close to 80% power in McNemar’s 
test. Even for higher proportions of discordant pairs, assuming the high differences between before and 
after treatment that we expect to observe, e.g., 50% or more, 80% power can be attained in Mc Nemar’s 
test (Tabl e 4). In Fisher’s exact test, we will attain 80% power or more to detect differences between 
Omegaven® and historical controls of 45% or larger, regardless of the frequency of adverse events in each 
g
roup (Table 5).

If under the discretion of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_632649]®, the 
patient is required to return to [LOCATION_011] every 2 months or other mutually agreed upon schedule for evaluation and 
follow up. The Principle Investigator  also requires for arrangements to be made through the patient’s home health 
care agency for the required weekly or monthly blood draws the patient will need while at home in order to remain 
on Omegaven®. The lab results then must be faxed to Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632650] a timely manner.  Additionally, 
m
easures will be taken to decrease the chance of administration errors when Omegaven® is given in the home. 
Fam
ilies will be provided with a letter outlining strategies for reducing medication administration errors, such as 
independent double-checks. Also, families will be provided with fish stickers to be affixed to their Omegaven® 
pump to decrease the likelihood of using the incorrect pump to administer Omegaven®.  
 
Dose reduction will occur if there is evidence of lipid intolerance (serum triglycerides > 200mg/dL) or 
evidence of bleeding. Growth indices include weight, length, and head circumference will also be 
monitored.   
 
Other standard care laboratory results will be captured for the Omegaven® protocol.  These are listed

Omegaven® has been studied in animal pre-clinical models as well as Phase I, II, III, and post marketing 
human tr
ials in both Europe and Asia. Prolonged bleeding time and an inhibited platelet aggregation can 
occur. It should not be administered to patients known to be allergic to fish or egg protein.  
 
Contraindications to Omegaven® include the following: 
 
I
mpaired lipid metabolism  
Severe hemorrhagic disorders 
Unstable diabetes mellitus 
Collapse and shock 
Stroke/ Embolism 
Recent cardiac infarction  
Undefined coma status 
 
Side effects: 
 
The infusion of Omegaven® can lead to a prolonged bleeding time and an inhibited platelet aggregation. In 
ra
re cases, patients may experience a fishy taste. 
 
The administration of Omegaven® should be stopped or reduced if there is a marked increased in blood 
g
lucose levels during the Omegaven® infusion. Undesirable effects that are seen during the infusion of 
Ome
gaven® that may also occur with conventional fat emulsions (i.e., Intralipid®) inc lude: 
 
Slight rise in body temperature  
Heat sensation and/or cold sensation 
Chills 
Flushing or cyanosis 
Lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting  
Dyspnea 
Headache, pain in the chest, bone pain 
Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_632652]/decrease blood pressure 
Anaphylactic reactions/erythema 
 
Other expected adverse events that are common to all patients with short bowel syndrome, regardless of 
the type of fat emulsion they receive, include blood stream infections and re-admittance to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
C
auses for re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_370107], bloodstream infections, electrolyte abnormalities, bowel 
obstruction, and central venous catheter malfunction. 
 
Overdose: 
 
In the event of an overdose of Omegaven®, there is a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_632653] >200 mg/dL acutely as a result of too rapid a rate of infusion, or 
chronically at high infusion rates in ass ociated with a change in the patient’s clinical condition (e.g., renal 
dysfunction, sepsis).  In such cases, the infusion should be stopped or, if necessary, continued at a reduced 
dose. Metabolic acidosis has occurred in patients receiving Omegaven® at excessive doses without 
sim
ultaneous administration of dextrose.

Committee on Clinical Investigati on, Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_011]  Page [ADDRESS_844775], 4th Floor, [LOCATION_011], MA  [ZIP_CODE]   --  Phone:  (617) 355- 7052                            VERSION 03/ 06/2018   
Potential Benefit of Omegaven® Treatment 
 
Omegaven® may be effective in stabilizing or reversing hepatic injury associated with the use of 
pa
renteral nutrition. It may allow the patient to continue to receive the majority of his/her caloric intake 
from parenteral nutrition while advancing on enteral nutrition or awaiting liver or liver/intestinal 
transplant 
 
Potential Risks of No Treatment 
 
Since Omegaven® will only be offered to those patients for whom no standard therapy is likely to safe and 
e
ffective, the risks of not being treated are those allowing for the natural history of their disease and 
associated clinical manifestations to progress. These include fulminate liver failure and death. 
 
Summary – Overall Risk Assessment 
 
P
atients will be at some risk inherent in taking a pharmaceutical agent that has not been fully evaluated for 
long duration treatment. However, the availability of safety data demonstrates no life-threatening risks or 
toxicities to vital organs or physiologic functions. Prolonged bleeding times and inhibition of platelet 
aggregation are a potential risk, especially to those patients with an underlying coagulopathy or those 
being treated with an anticoagulant. The potential benefits of Omegaven® in this patient population are 
mainl
y based on the experimental evidence and a single case of dramatic success. However, the study will 
only be available to those for whom no standard therapy is available or appropriate, or has already failed. 
The risks and potential benefits will require careful individual assessment by [CONTACT_632687].  The heterogeneity of clinical manifestations will lead to non-uniform risk-benefit ratios across 
the eligible patient population. 
7. Potential Benefits 
 
The
 potential benefits of this study apply directly to the patient in question and to possible improvement in 
the treatment of future patients. If successful, the  experimental treatment will provide a safe and effective 
means of avoiding liver failure requiring transplant or that may  lead to death.  Thus, the potenital 
complications of surgery or fulminant hepatic failure may be avoided.  
 
PN associated liver disease is a life threatening condition . Available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (liver/small bowel 
transplant, intestinal lengthening, ursodiol, combination enteral/parenteral feedings) are often inadequate.  
Phytosterol containing intravenous fat emulsions containing large quantities of omega [ADDRESS_844776] 
been associated with PN associated liver disease. One patient, with bridging fibrosis secondary to 
prolonged PN/lipid therapy, treated with Omegaven® has had a sustained dramatic response with 
re
solution of jaundice and direct bilirubin levels < 2. The safety profile of Omegaven® has been 
de
monstrated to be acceptable for the diseases treated and should be considered as an option for patients 
requiring a form of intravenous fat emulsion.

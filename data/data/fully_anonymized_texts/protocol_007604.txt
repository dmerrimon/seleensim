refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small 
Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To determine the safety of duvelisib  in subjects with CLL or 
SLL 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of duvelisib and, if 
applicable, its metabolite(s)  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To evaluate the health -related quality of life (QoL) of subjects  
• To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers of duvelisib   
• To evaluate biomarkers that may predict duvelisib clinical 
activity and/or safety  
• To evaluate mechanisms of resistance in subjects who exhibit 
disease progression while being treated with duvelisib or 
ofatumumab  
• To evaluate genomic features of tumors predictive of response in subjects treated with duvelisib  or ofatumumab

09 February 2017 (Amendment 3) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 110 Study Treatment : Treatment Arm A : Duvelisib  
Duvelisib  is administered orally and supplied as 5 mg and 25 mg 
formulated capsules.  
Treatment Arm B: Ofatumumab  
Ofatumumab is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion and is 
supplied in single -use vials at two strengths, 100 mg/5 mL and 
1000 mg/50 mL  
Study Design:  
 Study IPI-145-07 is a two- arm, randomized (1:1 ratio), open-label, 
phase 3, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of duvelisib  compared to ofatumumab. Subjects will be stratified by:  
1. High -risk cytogenetics (presence vs  absence of del[ 17p]) 
2. Refractory/early relapse to purine analog -based th erapy 
(defined as progression <12 months after 
fludarabine/pentostatin : yes vs no )  
3. Grade 4 cytopenia(s) (presence vs absence of neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia at baseline)   
Schedule of Administration Duvelisib  (Arm 1)  
Subjects randomized to duvelisib will be given a starting dose of 
duvelisib  25 mg administered orally twice daily (BID) initially in a 21 -
day treatment cycle followed by 28- day treatment cycles for up to 
18 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  
(whichever comes first ). After 18 complete cycles of treatment, 
subjects may receive additional cycles of duvelisib until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity if they , in the judgment of the 
investigator, may derive benefit from continued treatment  
(see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
Schedule of Administration Ofatumumab (Arm 2) 
Subjects randomized to ofatumumab will receive  treatment consistent 
with the approved product labeling:  8 weekly infusions, starting with 
an initial dose of  ofatumumab 300 mg IV on Day 1 followed by [CONTACT_276337] 2000 mg. Thereafter, subjects will receive 
ofatumumab 2000 mg once every month for four months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever comes first), 
as outlined in the schedule of assessments. Administration of 
ofatumumab will not exceed the 12 doses (within 7 cycles) as 
described in the prescribing information. 
Disease Response Asse ssments (All Subjects)  
Disease response assessments will include computed tomography ( CT) 
scans, bone marrow biopsy (whe n indicated), complete blood count 
(CBC) and differential counts, focused physical exams (PE), and 
assessment of disease- related constitutional symptoms. Disease 
Response A ssessment s will occur at Screening, and Day 1 of Cycles 3,  
5, 7, 11, 15, and 19 for subjects on both treatment arms. After Cycle

Methodology: Sample Size Determination  
The sample size was determined to provide sufficient power to test the 
primary endpoint of PFS in a group sequential design with one planned interim analysis. Assuming an exponential distribution for 
PFS, a total number of 185 PFS events (deaths or progressions) will 
provide approximately 93% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 
(median PFS of 9 months in the ofatumumab group vs 15 months in 
the duvelisib group) using a one- sided log- rank test at a 2.5% overall 
significance level (ie, alpha of 0.025)
. A total of 300 subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ofatumumab or duvelisib. 
Assuming a peak accrual rate of 30 subjects per month with 11 months 
for accrual ramp -up and a 4% cumulative dropout rate per year, then 
enrollment would  complete in [ADDRESS_337275].   
Analysis Sets  
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) analysis set will include all subjects who 
were randomized, with treatment group designated according to initial 
randomization. The ITT analysis set will serve as the primary analysis 
set for all efficacy endpoints and demographics.  
The All -Treated (AT) analysis set will include all subjects who 
received any amount of study drug ( duvelisib  or ofatumumab), with 
treatment group designated according to actual study treatment 
received. The AT analysis set will be the primary analysis set  for 
safety endpoints. 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:  
A stratified log -rank test (1 -sided) will be used to compare PFS of the 
duvelisib  arm against PFS of the ofatumumab arm at the interim and 
final analyses with the overall one -sided significance level contro lled 
at 0.025. The nominal p- value required for statistical significance at an 
analysis will be calculated based on the numbers of PFS events at all preceding and current analyses. The hazard ratio and the 
corresponding 2- sided 95% confidence interval will be estimated using 
a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. For both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model, the strata will be those used for 
stratified randomization, with potential pooling of strata specified in the Statistical A nalysis Plan ( SAP). PFS will be plotted for each 
treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method.

a. See Section 6.2 and 6.3 for additional information on each assessment.  
b. AEs are collected  (and SAEs reported)  through [ADDRESS_337288] dose of ofatumumab .  
c. Additional (unscheduled) assessments should be done as clinically indicated.  Blood samples should be drawn and results reviewed within 72 hours of the designated clinic 
visit.  
d. Screening evaluations performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 can be used and assessments don’t need to be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1  (predose)  
e. Drawn at Day 1 of Cycles 3,  5, 7, 11, 15, 19, and E TT. Blood for immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], serum for biomarkers, and blood for biomarkers does not need to be collected beyond 
the ETT visit or treatment discontinuation  
f. May be either urine or serum, and will be performed every odd cycle while on treatment.  
g. To be sent to the central laboratory.  
h. This sample may be drawn at screening or Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose). Collection at Cycle 1 Day 1 is preferred. If drawn at screening, a sample is not needed at Cycle 1  Day 1.  
i. This sample will be analyzed centrally and is separate from the documentation of prior del (17p) analysis required for eligibility and stratification.   
j. Samples on Cycle 1 Day 1 should  be drawn predose.   
k. Pharmacogenomics sample  (buccal swab)  is optiona l. 
l. QoL assessments to be captured at on Day [ADDRESS_337289] withdrawal, or initiation of additional anticancer therapy  and 
when possible, at the E TT (if >[ADDRESS_337290] administered questionnaire).  
m. Requests for archival tissue (pretreatment sample) should be initiated at C ycle [ADDRESS_337291] is placed but no archival tissue can be located, this sample type 
is not required. 
n. The Early Treatment Termination (ET T) Visit should occur for any subject who discontinues ofatumumab treatment prior to Cycle 7 Day 1.  ETT assessments need not be 
performed for those assessments performed within the previous 2 weeks (previous 30 days for Disease Response Assessments [see Table 5] and the QoL assessment ).  
o. The clinical visit schedule should be maintained until C ycle [ADDRESS_337292] withdrawal, or initiation of additional anticancer therapy ; no 
additional study drug (ofat umumab) will be administered .

This assessment can be conducted by [CONTACT_37261].  Information on initiation of other  
anticancer therapy (including start date, therapy type, and response on treatment) will also be collected.  
d. On-treatment Disease Response Assessments should be delayed if a subject’s dose ( duvelisib  or ofatumumab) is held for >1 week at the time of the scheduled assessment; subjects should be on 
treatment for a minimum of [ADDRESS_337295], abdomen and pelvis are required for all subjects in both treatment arms. These assessment s may be performed within 7 da ys (Day - 7 to Day 1) of initiating the next cycle of 
therapy. The frequency provided is the minimum required for study participation. Other scans may be performed (eg, head/neck CT) if clinically indicated or if the area is a site of known disease.

1.1 INTRODUCTION 
Duvelisb is a potent phosphoinositide -3-kinase (PI3K)- δ,γ inhibitor being developed by 
[CONTACT_276342] , Inc. ( Verastem ).  PI3K -δ and PI3K -γ isoforms are necessary for adaptive and 
innate immunity, and are important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic 
malignancies .  Therefore,  duvelisib is being developed as an orally administered potential 
therapeutic in hematologic malignancy and inflammatory disease indications.    
In a Phase 1 study of duvelisib  in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic 
malignancies, clinical acti vity was observed early in dose- escalation in subjects with relapsed 
or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma 
(SLL).  In addition, duvelisib was dosed below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in a 
cohort of relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL subjects.  The preliminary safety and efficacy 
profile of duvelisib observed to date in this patient population suggests duvelisib  has clinical 
activity in patients with CLL/SLL and may have a superior progression- free survival ( PFS) 
and/or overall response rate ( ORR ) compared to ofatumumab, a CD20- directed cytolytic 
therapy recommended for use in treating relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate duvelisib compared to ofatumumab in the treatment of subject s with 
relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL.  
1.[ADDRESS_337311] common adult leukemia in Western countries with an incidence of 4.2 per 100,000 per year. In the elderly (> 80 years of age), t he incidence increases to > 30 per 
100,000 per year.
3 The median a ge at diagnosis is 72 years, with approximately  10% younger 
than [ADDRESS_337312].  The major difference is that in SLL , the abnormal 
lymphocytes are found predominantly in the lymph nodes, while in CLL the abnormal lymphocytes are also found in the bone marrow and peripheral blood (≥  5,000 clonal 
cells/µL).
5 
Treatment of CLL/SLL is indicated in the presence of active, symptomatic disease. The intensity of the therapy is dependent on patient  age, relative comorbidities , and the presence 
or absence of high- risk cytogenetic features ( eg, deletion of 17p [del (17p)] ).   
In the first -line setting, chemotherapy with alkylating agents has been the treatment of cho ice 
for patients with advanced and progressive CLL. Since the introduction of chemoimmunotherapy regimens using purine nucleoside- analogs ( such as fludarabine and 
cladribine ) and pentostatin alkylating agents (such as chlorambucil and bendamustine) in 
combination with rituximab, a CD20- directed cytolytic antibody , these have become the 
preferred therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276307]- risk 
cytogenetic features. In frail or  elderly patients, single agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276308] : chlorambucil; bendamustine; or alemtuzumab, a CD52- directed c ytolytic antibody. 
Similarly, patients with specific molecular f eatures like del( 17p) do not derive as much

09 February 2017 (Amendment  3)  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_337313]- line treatment of CLL patients includes 
selection of single agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276309], relative comorbidities, and the 
presence or absence of high- risk cytogenetic features [ ie, del( 17p)] . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_276310], the majority of patients with CLL will relapse following first- line therapy 
and can acquire high -risk genetic abnormalities.  
In relapsed or refractory CLL/SL L, treatment options are again dependent of the patient age, 
relative co morbidities , and the presence or absence of high risk cytogenetics. Patients are 
often re -treated with previously administered regimens if the r elapse occurs  ≥12 or 24 months 
after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, respectively.   However, the majority of patients  
are not cured of their CLL/SLL and  will eventually develop high-risk disease for which 
retreatment with prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276311] ( ie, bendamustine in relapsed high risk cytogenetics) or no longer routinely 
available (ie, alemtuzumab).  In this setting, ofatumumab , a humanized CD20- directed 
cytolytic antibody , has demonstrated significant benefit.  
1.2.2 Choice of Comparator 
Ofatumumab was selected for use in this study based on the evolving treatment patterns across the regions intended for participation in this study.  Use of ofatumumab in the patient population defined in this study is supported by [CONTACT_276343] a review of the literature , 
6, 7 established treatment guidelines 4, 8 and consultation with multiple expert 
advisors.  It is expected that ofatumumab will be an acceptable choice for use at treatment centers where subjects  with relapsed/refractory CLL who, unless otherwise contraindicated 
per treatment guidelines, would have routinely already received purine- analog based therapy 
(ie, fludarabine or pentostatin). 
1.2.[ADDRESS_337314] human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to be approved for CLL patients in the US and European Union ( EU). On October 26, 2009 and April 19, 2010, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
granted approval of ofatumumab (A RZERRA
®, Gla xoSmithKline) for the treatment of CLL 
in patients who are refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. Approval was based on the unmet medical need and provisions allowing early access to promising agents (US approval granted under 21 CFR 601, Subpart E ; EU approval granted under conditional circumstances). 
Approvals were  based on a clinically meaningful and durable ORR  observed in a single- arm 
trial.
9 
Following an efficacy supplement filed in April 2014, ofatumumab was converted to full approval by [CONTACT_276344] 17, 2014 and May 22, 2014, respectively.  Per the FDA, ofatumumab is now also indicated in combination with chlorambucil for the treatment of previously untreated patients with CLL for whom fludarabine- based therapy is 
considered inappropriate ( the EMA indication statement also includes ofatumumab in 
combination with bendamustine).  The full approval was based on data from the Phase III study of ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil vs. chlorambucil, which demonstrated statistically significant improvement in median PFS in patients who received the

chlorambucil alone.  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ’s (NCCN's ) Drugs & Biologics Compendium 
recommends the use of ofatumumab as a single-agent or combination salvage therapy in rituximab -intolerant patients for disease that does not respond to primary therapy or for 
progressive or relapsed disease. For additional information on ofatumumab, please refer to the latest product label .

1.2.4 Functions of PI3K -δ and PI3K- γ  
There are four mammalian isoforms of class 1 PI3Ks: PI3K- α, β,δ (class 1a PI3Ks) and 
PI3K -γ (class 1b PI3K).  These PI3Ks catalyze the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-
trisphosphate (PIP3), leading to activation of the downstream effector pathways important for cellular survival, differentiation, and function.  PI3K- α and PI3K -β are widely expressed, and 
are important mediators of signaling from cell surface receptors.  PI3K -α is the isoform most 
often found mutated in cancers, and has a role in insulin signal ing and glucose homeostasis.
12, 
13  PI3K -β is activated in cancers where phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is deleted.  
Both isoforms are targets of small molecule therapeutics in development for cancer.  PI3K -δ 
and P13K- γ are preferentially expressed in leukocytes, and are important in leukocyte 
function.   
PI3K -δ is activated by [CONTACT_276345] ( eg, receptor tyrosine kinases) through interaction 
with the SH2 domains of the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85), or through direct interaction with 
RAS.   
PI3K -γ is associ ated with G -protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), is responsible for the very 
rapid induction of PIP3 in response to GPCRs, and can be also activated by [CONTACT_276346].  PIP3 produced by [CONTACT_976]3K activates effector pathways downstream through interaction with pleckstrin homology (PH) domain containing enzymes ( eg, PDK-1 and AKT 
[PKB]).
14   
1.2.5 Functions of PI3K- δ and PI3K -γ in Hematologic Cancers  
PI3K -δ and PI3K- γ are expressed in hemato poietic cells, and are critical for the ability of 
normal immune cells to respond to survival and differentiation signals in their environment.  In cancer patients, where the pathways mediated by [CONTACT_976]3K -δ,γ contribute to survival, 
proliferation, and differentiation of cancer cells, treatment with duvelisib may be beneficial. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development and maintenance of cancer cells.
15  Cancer cells through the expression of various cytokines, growth factors, and 
chemokines recruit multiple cell types including myeloid cells capable of differentiating into tumor- assoc iated macrophages (TAMs) which promote angiogenesis and augment tumor 
growth.
[ADDRESS_337315] in oncology.  Recently, it has been demonstrated that 
tumor growth, invasion of CD11b+ myeloid cells, angiogenesis and metastasis of tumors implanted into PI3K -γ deficient mice , were substantially suppressed compared to wild- type 
controls.
17 Treatment of mice bearing Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) allografts with the 
selective PI3K -γ inhibitor TG100-115, suppressed tumor inflammation, growth and

09 February 2017 (Amendment  3)  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_337316] on LLC proliferation in vitro .  Because the expression 
of PI3K- γ is restricted to the hematological lineage, data suggests that PI3K -γ inhibition acts 
in a cancer cell -extrinsic manner to suppress tumor associated inflammation, angiogenesis and 
tumor progression.17 
1.3 DUVELISIB  
PI3K -δ and PI3K- γ contribute to the development and maintenance of inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases, and hematologic malignancies.13, 14, 18, 19  Duvelisib  is a potent PI3K- δ,γ 
inhibitor being developed as a potential therapeutic in hematologic malignancy and 
inflammatory disease indications.

serious adverse events (SAEs).    
Pharmacokinetic assessments demonstrated that d uvelisib  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_276312], with the maximum plasma conce ntration observed 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1  hour after dosing.  Across the dose ranges evaluated, duvelisib  exposure increased 
proportionally to dose.  The mean elimination half -life ranged from 6.5 to 11.7 hours after 
repeat dosing and did not depend on the dose level administered.  Duvelisib  accumulation was 
less than 2 -fold following 14 days of Q12 h oral administration.   
Data from the drug -drug interacti on (DDI) portion indicated that c oncomitant administration 
of 200 mg ketoconazole every 12 hours (Q12 h) increased exposure to duvelisib .  On average, 
Cmax, AUC 0-last and AUC 0-inf increased by [CONTACT_3450] 66% , 285% and 295%, respectively, 
in the presence of ketoconazole compared to duvelisib administered alone.   
See the duvelisib Investigator’s Brochure for further information.

[n=1]; 15 mg [n=2] ; 25 mg [n=28];  75 mg [n=24]). The median t ime on treatment for all 
relapsed/refractory subject doses was 5.9 months (range 0.9 to 34.1 months), and 7.6 months (range 0.9 to 34.1 months) for doses ≤  25 mg.
20 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 75 mg BID based upon two dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) experienced by [CONTACT_276347] 100 mg BID (Grade 3 rash and Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST] elevations).  
Six expansion cohorts were enrolled at [ADDRESS_337319] diseases. The 25 mg  dose was selected for phase 3 
development based on clinical activity.

Clinical Safety  in Relapsed/Refractory CLL/SLL  
Frequently occurring (≥ 20% subjects ) AE s observed in all relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL 
subje cts (n=55) incl uded neutropenia (53 %), rash (combined terms) (46 %), diarrhea ( 44%),  
cough (38%), fatigue ( 38%), pneumonia (combined terms ) (36%), ALT /AST increased 
(29%),  anemia (29%),  pyrexia (2 7%), nausea (2 6%), decreased appetite (24%), and 
thrombocytopenia (22%) .  Serious adverse events occurring in more than 1 relapsed/refractory 
CLL/SLL subject  included pneumonia (combined terms) (15 [27%])), febrile neutropenia (8 
[15%]), diarrhea (3 [5 %]), constipation (2 [4% ]), hypercalcemia (2 [4 %]), pyrexia (2 [4 %]),  
and stomatitis (2 [ 4%]).20   
These events are not unexpected based on the patient population and the mechanism of action 
of duvelisib.  Infection prophylaxis and dose modifications included in the IPI-145-07 
protocol are intended to reduce the risk of the frequently occurring events.

1.5 DETERMINATION OF STARTING DOSE AND REG IMEN   
Dose levels of duvelisib  ranging from 8 mg BID to 100 mg BID were evaluated in 
Study IPI-145-02, a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study in subjects with advanced 
hematologic malignancies where duvelisib  was administered BID continuously in 28- day 
cycles as a single agent. At the time this protocol was developed, the dose- escalation phase of 
Study IPI-145-02 was  complete and the MTD  was determined to be 75 mg BID.  A total of 
193 subjects had been dosed in the study as of 28 October 2013.   
Based on the available data, the following findings were considered in determining the dose 
and schedule (25 mg BID) for this study : 
• Of the 27 relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL subjects  with evaluable efficacy data who 
received ≤ [ADDRESS_337323]  achieved a CR and 12 subjects  achieved 
a PR based on IWCLL 2008 response criteria (best response) ;  
• The median time to response was rapid (1.9 months) with a PR observed in 6 subjects  
after 2 cycles, in 4  subjects after 4 cycles, and in 2 subjects  after 6 cycles of duvelisib 
treatment; 
• 85% (11/13) of the relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL subjects  with evaluable efficacy data 
who received ≤  [ADDRESS_337324] demonstrated a nodal 
response, defined as > 50% reduction in adenopathy based on CT scans.  Eight of 11 
subjects  experienced a nodal response after 2 cycles of duvelisib treatment; and  
• After 2 cycles of duvelisib  treatment, a nodal response was reported in 4 out of the 6 
subjects  who went on to achieve a PR after 4 -6 cycles of duvelisib treatment.  These 
data introduce the possibility that nodal responses (> 50% reduction in adenopathy) may be a precursor of response as defined by [CONTACT_276349].  In clinical studies of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276315], it has been reported that nodal responses have preceded PRs or CRs . 
22 
Pharmacodynamics  
Preliminary exposure -response analyses observed in Study IPI-145-02 support ed the rationale 
that duvelisib dosed at 25 mg BID is expected to be efficacious.  The relationship between steady state exposure (collected at the beginning of Cycle 2) and reduction in lymph node size (assessed at the beginning of Cycle 3) in patients with CLL is provided in Figure 2. Increased 
exposure did not result in greater reductions in adenopathy; based on these preliminary data, a dose of 25 mg BID provides exposure anticipated to be efficacious.

in CLL/SLL Subjects  (Study IPI -145-02; preliminary data)  
 
The serine/threonine kinase AKT is directly phosphorylated by [CONTACT_976]3Ks, therefore the reduction 
in phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) was used as a pharmacodynamic marker for tumor cell PI3K inhibition in subjects  with CLL in Study IPI -145-02. Percent pAKT inhibition versus 
duvelisib plas ma concentration following a single dose is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 3. Duvelisib  
inhibits phosphorylation of AKT in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal effects observed at concentrations observed following a 25 mg dose of duvelisib . Further elevations 
in duvelisib plasma concentration did not provide additional inhibition of pAKT.

Study IPI -145-07 is a two -arm, randomized (1:1 ratio), open label, phase 3, superiority trial 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duvelisib  compared to ofatumumab. Subjects 
will be stratified by:  
1. High-risk cytogenetics (presence vs absence of del[ 17p]) 
2. Refractory /early relapse to purine analog based therapy  (defined as progression <  
12 months after fludarabine/pentostatin: yes vs no)  
3. Grade 4 cytopenia(s) (presence vs absence of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia at 
baseline)   
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms:  
• Arm 1: Duvelisib , 25 mg BID  
• Arm 2: Ofatumumab  
First dose is to occur within [ADDRESS_337325] dose of study drug (either duvelisib or ofatumumab). The first treatment cycle for each treatment arm will be 3 wee ks (21± 2 days). Subsequent treatment cycles will be 
4 weeks (28±4 days).  
Arm 1  (Duvelisib ):  Subjects randomized to duvelisib will receive their first dose of study 
drug in clinic on Day 1, initiating Cycle 1 of treatment. These subjects will return  for a second 
clinical visit on Day 8±2. Cycle [ADDRESS_337326] clinic visits  on Day 1 and on Day 15±2. Each subsequent c ycle 
(Cycle 3-7) and then every odd cycle (Cycle 9 to 19) will have o nly one clinic visit on Day 1.  
Subjects will receive duvelisib  continuously for [ADDRESS_337327] CLL/SLL requiring treatment by [CONTACT_51199] 19 Day 1  (Reference 
[IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Subjects  who receive duvelisib  beyond 18 cycles (Cycle 19 D ay 1)  will maintain clinical 
visits ever y odd cycle (Cycle 21, 23, etc) until disease progression , subject withdrawal, or 
initiation of additional anticancer treatment. After Cycle 18, disease r esponse assessme nts will 
continue every [ADDRESS_337328] not had disease progression, withdrawn 
consent , or initiated  additional anticancer treatment.  
Arm 2  (Ofatumumab) :  Subjects randomized to ofatumumab will receive IV treatment 
according to the approved prescribing information.10, [ADDRESS_337329] .

Subjects will be monitored co ntinuously for toxicity while on study treatment. Toxicity will 
be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03. If a subject has an AE  at least possibly related to 
duvelisib, then dose interruptions/holds with possible modifications as described below in  
Table 8 may be implemented.  Deviations from these guidelines may occur based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator with notification to the Medical Monitor/Sponsor.  There 
should be no attempt to make up for missed doses of duvelisib.

Treatment Interruption for Non hematologic Toxicity  
Treatment with duvelisib should be interrupted for the following nonhematologic toxicities: 
• Grade 2 or higher pneumonitis/pneumonia, defined as symptomatic and  requiring 
medical intervention , including ora l antimicrobials and/or steroids  
o Subjects who develop new pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of 
breath, dyspnea on exertion) or new radiographic findings should have duvelisib held and receive empi[INVESTIGATOR_276316]. Corticosteroids for symptomatic treatment of pneumonitis is 
recommended (and allowed per protocol). Restarting treatment with duvelisib is allowed after complete resolution of symptoms.   
• Grade 3 or higher other nonhematologic toxicity  including the following: 
o Infections : Subjects who develop infections requiring IV 
antibiotics/antifungals/anti-virals should have duvelisib  held until infection 
resolves (subject may restart duvelisib when  completing a course of oral 
therapy).  Prophylaxis to prevent recurrence/opportunistic infections will not preclude the subject from r estarting  treatment.  
o Hepatic events : Subjects who develop Grade 3 or higher transaminase 
(ALT/AST) elevations with or without clinical symptoms should have duvelisib held  until return to baseline. Additional work- up to evaluate viral 
infection/re -activation , exposure to environmental toxins (eg, alcohol/con-
meds), or other causes is recommended before restarting treatment with duvelisib.

6.3.3 Study Drug Administration , Criteria for Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS] Duvelisib  
Beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1, duvelisib 25 mg BID will be administered daily in an initial 21 -
day cycle  BID, followed by 28- day cycles . Subjects are required to  receive pneumocystis 
prophylaxis concomitant with treatment with study drug  per institutional guidelines . Subjects 
who are found to be intolerant of pneumocystis prophylaxis may continue with study 
treatment at the discretion of the Investigator . Herpes (HSV/VSV) or CMV prophylaxis 
concomitant with study drug is also recommended ( Section 6.3.5).

administration are described in Section  7.2.1 and  7.2.2, respectively.    
An attempt should be made to enable each dose to be take n at approximately the same time of 
day.     
For dose modifications due to adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, see Section 4.2.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ofatumumab 
Ofatumumab will be administered  in accordance with the A RZERRA® Prescribing 
Information . Each subject randomized to ofatumumab will receive no more than 12 doses as 
described in  Table 4 . Refer to Section 6.3.5 for recommended prophylactic treatment.  
If the dose of ofatumumab is reduced, all reductions should be made per Table 10 (based on 
Prescribing Information ). Additional details on study drug dosage and administration are 
described in Section  7.2.1 and 7.2.2, respectively.   
The date, time, and quantity of each infusion will be recorded in the source documents. 
For dose modifications due to adverse events and laboratory abnormalities, see Section 4.2.2 
and the A RZERRA® package insert. 
6.3.4 Adverse Events  
For all subjects (including screen -failures), m onitoring of AEs will be performed from the 
signing of the ICF. For randomized subjects, AEs will be  collected on the AE eCRF from the 
signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_337367]’s own perceptions about his or her QoL.  Every effort should be made to maintain an unbiased assessment. If the subject cannot complete the health outcomes assessments because of illiteracy or other documented reason, a proxy (such as a caregiver) cannot complete the questionnaires, as these questionnaires are intended to be subject-reported measures only.   
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) is a modular approach to assess 
patient health status using a ‘core’ set of questions (FACT- G), as well as a cancer site specific 
module.  The FACIT -Fatigue is a [ADDRESS_337368]-G designed 
to assess patient concerns relating to the symptoms of fatigue.   
The EuroQol-5D is a standardized instrument that provides a simple descriptive profile and a 
single index value for health status, and patient preference or utility for a health state. It comprises 5 items, covering the domains of mobility, self- care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each of these domains is rated on 3 levels, higher level s indicating greater difficulty.

screening , concomitant / previous medications will be assessed and includes all 
medications/pro cedures that have occurred within the previous 30 days.   
For all subjects during treatment  
• Antimicrobial prophylaxis:   
Infection is a recognized complication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL leading to 
many treatment centers to employ antimicrobia l prophylaxis.  Based on the duvelisib clinical 
experience to date and the ofatumumab product label (ARZERRA®) the following are 
required or recommended: 
o Pneumocystis infections have been reported in clinical studies with duvelisib and ofatumumab, therefore s ubjects are required to  receive pneumocystis prophylaxis 
concomitant with treatment with study drug. Please follow institutional guidelines.  
Subjects who are found to be intolerant of pneumocystis prophylaxis may continue with study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator.
 
o Herpes simplex  (HSV)  and herpes zoster  (VZV) infections have been observed 
with duvelisib and ofatumumab; therefore, subjects are recommended to receive herpes (HSV/VZV) prophylaxis concomitant treatmen t per investigator discretion.  
Please follow institutional guidelines.  
o For subjects with history of CMV infection that required treatment, prophylactic treatment per institutional guidelines is recommended.  
 Subjects with history of CMV or EBV infection and/or who enter the study while receiving antiviral prophylaxis should be monitored for reactivation via serology or viral load detection per institutional guidelines while on study treatment  
o Other antimicrobial prophylaxis based on the individual subject’ s medical history 
may be considered if no contraindications based on drug-drug interactions (DDI).  See below.  
• Transfusion support (prophylaxis or supportive care):   
At study entry or during any time on treatment, blood cell transfusions (packed red blood cells or platelet s) to maintain a subject’s hemoglobin ≥8.0 mg/dL or platelets ≥10,000 per µL is 
recommended .  Transfusions may be used at any time as clinically indicated.    
For subjects treated with ofatumumab  
• Premedication : 
Premedicate 30 minutes to 2 hours prior to each dose with oral acetaminophen 1,000 mg (or equivalent), oral or intravenous antihistamine (diphenhydramine 50 mg or equivalent), and intravenous corticosteroid (prednisolone 100 mg or equivalent). Do not reduce corticosteroid dose for Doses 1, 2, and 9. Corticosteroid dose may be reduced as follows for Doses 3 through 8 and 10 through 12:

Grade 3 or greater infusion reaction did not occur with the preceding dose. 
− Doses 10 through 12: Administer prednisolone 50 mg to 100 mg or equivalent if a Grade 3 or greater infusion reaction did not occur with Dose 9. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibite d: Use of Vaccines  
For all subjects , the use of live or live attenuated vaccines is prohibited during the treatment 
with either study drug.   
The use of inactivated (or killed) vaccines is allowed during the study, however subjects and their physicians should be aware that the effectiveness of any vaccine administered concomitantly with duvelisib and ofatumumab may be diminished. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following the administration of either duvelisib or ofatumumab has not been studied. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited: Immunosuppressants 
Subjects are not to receive o ngoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants (eg, 
cyclosporine) or systemic steroids for >1 week at doses > the equivalent of 20 mg prednisone 
QD. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited: PI3K Inhibitors or B TK Inhibitors  
Subjects are not to have received any prior exposure to any PI3K or BTK inhibitor prior to 
study entry. [IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited: Other Anticancer Therapy or Investigational Agents 
During the Clinical Assessment Period (through Cycle 19 Day 1  for both trea tment arms) , 
subjects are not to receive any additional anticancer therapy or other investigational agents  
(including BTK inhibitors and other PI3K inhibitors) not outlined in the protocol during the 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited: ( Duvelisib  Subjects Onl y) 
• Medications or Food that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4: 
In vitro data indicate that oxidative metabolism may play an important role in the elimination of duvelisib, with CYP3A4 identified as a primary contributor to drug met abolism.  D ata from 
a drug -drug interaction study with ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A inhibitor) indicate exposure 
to duvelisib increased approximately 4 -fold in the presence of ketoconazole. Similarly, 
exposure to duvelisib was reduced approximately 80% when coadministered with rifampin, a recognized CYP 3A inducer.  Based on these data, the concomitant use of drugs or foods 
that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A are not allowed during study treatment  
with duvelisib .

[IP_ADDRESS] Use with Caution  (Duvelisib  Subjects Only):  
• Medications that are Substrates of CYP3A or CYP2C8  
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes have demonstrated duvelisib is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP2C8  and CYP3A4. Coadministration of duvelisib with 
midazolam, a probe CYP3A substrate, resulted in an approximate 4- fold increase in 
midazolam systemic exposure (AUC) . Systemic exposure to other medications that are 
substrates for CYP3A4 may be increased in subjects receiving duvelisib. The in vivo e ffect of 
duvelisib on the exposure of CYP2C8 substrates is not known. Caution should be used if duvelisib  is used concomitantly with drugs or foods tha t are substrates of CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4 , particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index .  
Appendix [ADDRESS_337370] of all medications which may be substrates of CYP3A or CYP2C8.  The Sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_276361]3A or CYP2C8 substrates. 
• Medications that are Substrates or Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein 
In vitro data indicate that duvelisib is a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P-gp).  Concomitant 
medications that inhibit P -gp may cause the steady state concentration of duvelisib  to be 
reached more quickly than usual.  Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that duvelisib has the potential to inhibit the active transport of other P -gp substrates. These medications 
may be us ed as medically indicated but with caution.

accordance with the ASCO guidelines. Prophylactic use of growth factors such as granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) and granulocyte macrophage-colony 
stimulating factor (GM -CSF) may be implemented if clin ically indicated, in accordance with 
local guidelines and medical practice ( eg, if a subject has Grade 4 neutropenia for ≥ 7 days, 
Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, or according to the NCCN practice guidelines for myeloid factors).  Subjects on a stable dose of erythropoietin to treat baseline anemia may continue on this therapy at this dose .

discretion of the Investigator. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Photo safety 
The effect of this medication on the skin, especially when in direct sunlight or with artificial 
ultraviolet ( UV) light (eg , tanning booths) is not known.  As a general precaution, subjects 
should be advised to use appropriate protective measures to minimize exposure to direct sunlight or UV light sources during the treatment period and for at least [ADDRESS_337372] dose of duvelisib. 
6.3.7 Pharmacokinetic  Sampling  
Peripheral blood will be collected from all subjects at qualified sites who are randomized to 
the duvelisib study treatmen t arm  to characterize the PK profile of duvelisib and , if applicabl e, 
its metabolites.  Samples  will be collected at the following time points , as describe in Table 3. 
• Cycle 2 Day 1 : ≤ 2 hours predose, 0.5 to 2 hours postdose, and 3 to 5 hours postdose. 
The morning dose of study medication will be adm inistered in the clinic   
• Cycle 3 Day 1: anytime during the visit  
• Cycle 7  Day 1 : anytime during the visit  
The exact date and time of the PK blood draws will be recorded, along with the date and time 
of the previous 2 doses of study medication. Additionally, collection of a PK sample is requested when feasible at the time of drug interruption/hold for an AE . If a subject 
permanently discontinues study treatment prior to Cycle 7, Day 1, PK blood samples no longer need to be collected.  
Subjects who have an unusual safety or efficacy event (ie, an AE different in type and severity from that which is expected in the setting of duvelisib  use or an exceptional response to 
treatment) may be a sked to have additional PK samples collected. These blood draws for 
pharmacokinetic analysis will only be performed after discussion between the Medical Monitor and the Principal Investigator.

7.5.1 Duvelisib  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of 
duvelisib investigational supplies received, and comparing it with the accompanying drug accountability form.  
All unused duvelisib will be retained at the site.  After full drug accountability and reconciliation,  the Investigator  will dispose of the study drug at t he clinical trial site according 
to site procedures, or at the Sponsor’s request will return all duvelisib to the Sponsor, or its designee.  If any study drug is lost or damaged, the disposition of the study drug should be 
documented.   
Subject s should be instructed to bring all unused duvelisib  to each study visit.  The study site 
should count all capsules that the subject  returns, and should take account for taken doses, 
missed doses, doses reduced due to missing or lost capsules, etc., before dispensing new study 
drug to the subject.  Any subject  who does not take the prescribed dose should be requested to 
return the remaining drug to the clinical trial site for accountability.

[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator is required to provide an assessment of relationship of AEs and SAEs to 
study drug.  A number of factors should be considered in making this assessment including:  1) the temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study drug ; 2) whe ther an 
alternative etiology has been identified; and/or 3) biological plausibility. The following 
guidelines should be used by [CONTACT_276370].   
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Not Drug Related”:  
• None:  The event is related to an etiology other than the study product administration (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).  
• Remote:  The event is unlikely to be related to the study product and likely to be related to factors other than study product. 
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Drug Related”:  
• Possible:  There is an association between the event and the administration of study drug, and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product; but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
• Probable:  There is an association between the event and the administration of study drug, there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product, and the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical status or an alternative etiology is n ot apparent.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event severity  
The Grade of the AE will be assessed according to the NCI -CTCAE Version  4.03.  Toxicities 
that are not specified in NCI- CTCAE Version  4.03 will be define d as follows:  
• Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.

8.2.2 Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events on the eCRF  
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
If a diagnosis is known at the time of reporting, this should be recorded in the eCRF and/or SAE Report F orm, as applicable,  rather than the individual signs and symptoms ( eg, record 
only hepatitis rather than elevated transaminases, bilirubin, jaundice).  However, if a constellation o f signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE Report F orm, if applicable) .  If a diagnosis is subsequently 
established, it should be reported as follow-up on the eCRF (and follow up SAE report, as applicable) and should replace the individual signs and/or symptoms as the event term on the 
eCRF  (and SAE report form, if applicable), unless the signs/symptoms are clinically 
significant.

In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events ( eg, clinical sequelae or a cascade of 
events) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252].  For example, if severe vomiting is known to result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as the SAE or AE on the eCRF (and SAE Report Form , if appl icable).  However, medically significant AEs occurring 
secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent

09 February 2017 (Amendment  3)  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 110 events on the eCRF (and SAE Report Form, if applicable) .  For example, if severe vomiting 
leads to acute ren al failure, both events should be recorded on the eCRF (SAE Report Form)  
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject 
evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the AE eCRF (and  SAE 
Report Form, if applicable) .  If a persistent AE changes in grade, it should be recorded as a 
new AE on the e CRF.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, and subsequently recurs .  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on the eCRF (and SAE Report 
Form  if applicable) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information and collected on the relevant eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the eCRF (and SAE Report Form , if applicable). Abnormal 
laboratory values will be reported as an AE if the laboratory result: 
• requires an adjustment in the trial drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment  
• require additional testing or surgical intervention  
• is associated with accompanying symptoms  
• is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093] 
[IP_ADDRESS] New Cancers  
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet at least one of the serious criteria ( see Section 8.1).  New primary cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the trial treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the subject into the trial.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.   
Progression of the disease under study (disease progression) is not an AE/SAE, unless fatal.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medication Errors, Misuse and Abuse of Study Drug 
Overdose, medication error, misuse and abuse are defined as follows:  
• Overdose: refers to the administration of a quantity of study drug given per 
administration or cumulative, which is above the maximum dose according to the protocol.  Clinical judgment should always be applied. 
• Medication error:  refers to an unintentional error in dispensing or administration of 
study drug not in accordance with the protocol.

Duvelisib (IPI -145) 
09 February 2017 (Amendment  3)  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 110 • Off-label use : relates to situations where the study drug is intentionally used for 
medical purpose not in accordance with the protocol. 
• Misu se: refers to situations where the study drug is intentionally and inappropriately 
used not in accordance with the protocol. 
• Abuse : corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study 
drug, which is accompanied by [CONTACT_276372].  
• Occupational exposure : refers to the exposure to the study drug as a result of one’s 
professional or non-professional occupation. 
Overdoses, medication errors, abuse or misuse will be collected as part of investigational 
medicinal product dosing information and/or as a protocol violation, as required.   
Any AE associated with an overdose, medication error, misuse or abuse of study drug should 
be recorded on the AE eCRF with the diagnosis of the AE.   
8.2.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_276373]  (including SAEs occurr ing in screen failure and randomized subjects)  will be 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of 
the event, even if the experience does not appear to be related to duvelisib  or ofatumumab, 
from the time of signing ICF through [ADDRESS_337392] dose of study drug.   
Serious adverse events should be communicated on an  SAE report form as follows:  
• Email: [EMAIL_2966]

• Fax: [PHONE_2421] ([LOCATION_003])  
• For i nternational numb ers, please refer to the SAE Report Form and supporting 
documentation. 
The initial SAE report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness 
and (serious) AE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigational product(s).  Information not available at the time of the initial report (eg, final diagnosis, an end date for the AE, or relevant laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up SAE Report F orm.  All SAE follow-up information must be 
reported in the same timelines as initial information (ie , within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
first knowledge of information). 
At any time after completion of the AE reporting period (ie, [ADDRESS_337393]- treatment), if an 
Investi gator becomes aware of an SAE that is suspected by [CONTACT_276374], the event must be reported as described above.

Any occupational exposure or exposure of an individual not enrolled in the study to the investigational medicinal product must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator's first knowledge of the event, even if the exposure does not result in an adverse event.  Unintentional exposures should be communicated on the SAE/MEOI report form, as described above for SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board  (IRBs) / 
Ethics Committee  
Verastem  or designee shall notify the Investigator and/or the IRBs/ECs per institutional 
guidelines of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other sources, including the 
following: 
• Suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. 
• Any findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. 
• Any finding from animal or  in vitro  testing that suggest a significant risk to human s 
exposed to the drug, such as mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity; or report of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure.

8.2.4 Pregnancy and In Utero  Drug Exposure  
Since duvelisib has not been evaluated in pregnant or nursing women, the treatment of 
pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using effe ctive 
contraception is contraindicated (see Section  5.1.1 and Section  6.2.1 for instructions on 
pregnancy testing and birth control). 
Pregnancies occurring in subjects  or partners of male subjects during the study treatment 
period until [ADDRESS_337395] ’s last dose of study treatment are c onsidered 
immediately reportable events.  If a pregnancy occurs in a subject , study treatment must be 
discontinued immediately.  The pregnant woman  should be referred to an 
obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling. 
The pregnancy must be reported to Verastem  or designee wi thin 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Notification Form as follows: 
• Hotline (Phone): [PHONE_5724] ([LOCATION_003])  
• Fax: [PHONE_2421] ([LOCATION_003])  
• For International numbers, please refer to the Pregnancy Notification Form a nd 
supporting documentation. 
The Investigator will follow the pregnant woman until completion of the pregnancy, and must  
notify Verastem  of the outcome within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
pregnancy outcome.  The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy 
Outcome Report Form.  This notification includes pregnancies resulting in live, “normal” births. 
If the pregnant subject  experiences an SAE during pregnancy, or the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion 
[any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (ie, report the event to Verastem  within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event).  
All neonatal deaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of causality) should be reported as SAEs to Verastem .  In addition, any infant death or congenital 
anomaly occurring after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to Verastem .

any major modification will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  
9.[ADDRESS_337396] the primary endpoint of PFS in a group sequential design with  one planned interim analysi s. 
Assuming an exponential distribution for PFS , a total number of 185 PFS events (deaths or 
progressions) will provide approximately 93% power  to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 (median 
PFS of 9 months in the ofatumumab group versus 15 months in the duvelisib group) using a one-sided log- rank test at a 2.5% overall significance level (ie, alpha of 0.025).  The study 
design employs the Lan-DeMets spending function for O’Brien-Fleming boundary as the alpha spending function and the Hwang-Shih- DeCani gamma ( -4) spending function as the 
beta spending function. A total of 300 subjects  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either ofatumumab or duvelisib . Assuming a peak accrual rate of 30 subjects per month with 
11 months for accrual ramp-up and a 4% cumulative dropout rate per year, then enrollment would complete in [ADDRESS_337397] important analysis sets are defined in this section, with additional analysis sets

PFS of the ofatumumab arm at the interim and final analyses with the overall one- sided  
significance level controlled at 0.025. The nominal p- value required for statistical significance 
at an analysis will be calculated based on the numbers of PFS events at all preceding and 
current analyses. The hazard ratio and the corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. For both the stratified 
log-rank test and the stratified Cox model, the strata will be those used for stratified randomization, with potential pooling of strata specified in the SAP. PFS will be plotted for each t reatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method.  Median PFS and its associated 95% CI 
will be estimated for each treatment group.  
Analyses of PFS using other censoring rules will be performed as sensitivity analyses. This will include a worst- comparison case sensitivity analysis in which surviving, non- progressing 
subjects who were lost to follow- up are treated as being censored at the last adequate disease 
assessment if they were on the ofatumumab arm, and treated as having an event at the time of the next scheduled disease assessment following the last adequate disease status assessment if they were on the duvelisib arm.  
Analyses of PFS will be performed for subgroups of subjects based on selected baseline 
variables, including stratification factors used for randomization.  The details of the subgroup analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.2 Analysis of Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Of the secondary endpoints, ORR, Lymph Node Response Rate, OS, and Hematologic 
Improvement Rate are designated as key secondary efficacy endpoints. If the primary 
endpoint is significant, the four key secondary endpoints will be sequentially tested at the 1 -
sided 0.025 significance level in the order listed above. If a null hypothesis is not rejected, formal sequential testing will be stopped .  The detailed testing strategy will be specified in the 
SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall  Response Rate (ORR)  
ORR will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test (1 -sided) to compare the two 
treatment groups.  The st rata for the test will be those used for stratified randomization, with 
potential pooling of strata specified in the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph Node Response R ate

[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival  (OS) 
Subjects  without documentation of death at the time of the data cutoff for analysis wi ll be 
censored at the date the subject  was last known to be alive, or the data cutoff date, whichever 
is earlier.  A s tratified one -sided log- rank test will be used to compare OS between the 
[ADDRESS_337402] ratios along with the 2- sided  95% CIs will be estimated using

along with the 2-sided 95% CIs, will be provided for each treatment group. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Improvement Rate 
A subject with a hematologic improvement is one who consistently met the criteria of an 
improvement in neutrophil count, hemoglobin or platelet count for a period of at least [ADDRESS_337404] transfusion or exogenous cytokines. Missing data or missing scheduled assessments during a potential 60 day hematologic improvement epi[INVESTIGATOR_276328] a hematologic improvement.

Analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints such as improvement in disease- related symptoms 
of fatigue, weight loss, unexplained fevers and night sweats from baseline, and minimal 
residual disease in subjects with documented CR or CRi will b e specified in the SAP.  
Additional exploratory efficacy endpoints may also be defined in the SAP.

validated high performance liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) 
method.   
The PK data collected will be analyzed by [CONTACT_276378], using appropriate 
software. The intent of the analysis is to obtain exposure data in subjects with CLL/SLL , to 
characterize the parameters of PK disposition, and to identify relevant covariates affecting drug exposure.  Anal yses of exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety endpoints 
may be conducted. The data may be pooled with the results of other studies to perform the population PK/ pharmacodynamics  analysis.  
Additional details on the pharmacokinetic methods and analysis will be provided in the SAP . 
9.7 ANALYSES OF OTHER ENDPOINTS  
Analyses of other exploratory endpoints such as those for health- related Q oL and biomarkers 
may be specified in the SAP  or another document. 
9.8 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
After approximately 50% of the planned PFS events (ie, 93 PFS events ) have been observed 
based on the blinded, independent, central review, an interim analysis of efficacy will be performed.  
At the interim analysis , PFS  will be tested at the alpha level based on the Lan-DeMets alpha 
spending function for O’Brien -Fleming  boundary with the opportunity to stop the study (other 
than survival follow-up) for overwhelming evidence of efficacy. If the interim analysis occurs 
at exactly 50% of the planned events, the criterion of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_276329]-sided p-
value of 0.0015 (corresponding approximately to a HR of 0.540). In the meantime, PFS will also be tested at the alpha level for futility based on the alpha and beta spending functions specified for the study design. If the interim analysis occurs  at exactly 50% of the planned 
events, the criterion of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_276330]-sided p-value of 0.4791 (corresponding approximately to a HR of 0.990). The futility boundary of this study is non-binding, meaning that the Type I error is properly controlled even if the study is continued after the futility boundary for PFS is crossed at the interim analysis.  Under the protocol design assumptions, the interim analysis  is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_337407] occurred in  the study.  The criterion of statistical 
significance (ie, boundary for efficacy) is one- sided p -value of 0.0245 (corresponding 
approximately to a HR of 0.748).

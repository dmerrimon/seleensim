Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  ASSESSMENTS : 
Efficacy  Assessments: During the double -blind phase, electronic diaries will be completed twice daily by [CONTACT_324312] (ie, sym ptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal discharge [ anterior 
and/or posterior ], facial pain or pressure sensation, and sense of smell ), and use of approved rescue medication 
after the Week [ADDRESS_400325] -completed questionnaires will be used to measure the symptoms and 
social/emotional consequences of the subject’s nasal disorder (SNOT - 22), health- related quality of life 
(EuroQol -5 D [ EQ-5D] SF-36v2, and Short Form -6 dimension [SF -6D]) , sleep quality and disturbances 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] [ PSQI ]), depressive symptoms (Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology [ QIDS] ), work productivity, and objective smell test (Smell Identification Test [ SIT]). 
Subjects will assess their global impression of change since starting the study drug using the Patient Global 
Impression of Change ( PGIC ) scale. Health economic information related to CRS  will also be collected  using 
the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (H PQ). Objective changes in disease severity will be assessed 
via sinus CT  scan and nasal polyp grading . 
Safety  Assessments : Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_324313], nasal examination,  
vital signs measurements (ie, blood pressure, pulse), weight, and through collection of information for 
concomitant medications . 
ENDPOINTS:  
Efficacy  
Primary:  
Co-Primary Endpoints : 
• change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in average instantaneous morning ( AM) scores (evaluation 
of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) of:  
o nasal congestion  
o nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior)  
o facial pain/p ressure sensation  
The b aseline CSNS  is the average of the total instantaneous AM scores over the last 7  days of the 
single -blind  run-in period, and at the end of Week  4, scores are averaged over 7  days before  Week  4. 
• change from baseline to Week 24/ET  in the APOV in the ethmoid  and maxillary sinuses   
 Key Secondary Endpoints:  
• change from baseline to Week 4 on CSNS score in subjects from studies OPN- FLU -CS-3205 and OPN -
FLU -CS-3206 who were symptomatic at trial entry despi[INVESTIGATOR_324259] 30 days of Visit 1 from  studies OPN -FLU -CS-3205 and OPN -FLU -CS-3206 
• frequency of acute exacerbations of CRS  over the 24-week  treatment period , defined as a worsening of 
symptoms that requires escalation of treatment , from studies OPN -FLU -CS-3205 and OPN -FLU -CS-3206 
 
Safety  Endpo ints:  
• monitoring AEs throughout the study; results of nasal examination , vital signs measurements (ie,  blood 
pressure, pulse) , and weight ; and monitoring concomitant medication usage  
DURATION OF THE STUDY:  
The duration of each subject’s enrollment is expected to be approximately 26 weeks.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:  
Sample Size Determination : Sample size requirements were based on previous Phase 3 studies of OPN -375 in 
subjects with nasal polyposis and data from a study evaluating the change in maxillary and ethmoid 
opacification in CRS patients treated with an intramuscular dose of triamcinolone. Based on the results for changes from baseline in morning symptoms among subjects with nasal polyps in the previous s tudies 
conducted with OPN -375, a sample of  111 subjects /group (333 total subjects) is sufficient to detect a 0.8 scale 
difference in morning symptoms score between treatments (OPN -375 vs placebo) using a 2- sided test at the 5% 
significance level with 88% p ower, and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.9. This sample size is also 
adequate to detect an 11.3% difference between treatment groups in average percent opacification using a 2-sided test at the 5% significance level with 88% power, and assuming a SD of 27%.  Approximately 
333 subjects will be randomized (111 subjects /group) to have at least 120 subjects without nasal polyps be 
included.

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  Primary Efficacy Analysis:  For the co -primary endpoint CSNS, the estimator is the mean difference between 
treatme nts (active versus placebo) in change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in the 7- day average total 
instantaneous AM CSNS.  Estimation is based on a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) where 
changes from baseline to Week 2 and Week 4 in the 7 -day average total instantaneous AM CSNS, respectively, 
are the repeated measures.  For the co -primary endpoint APOV, the estimator is the mean difference between 
treatments (active versus placebo) in the change from baseline to Week 24/ET  APOV.  Estimation is based o n 
an ANCOVA model including categorical effects for previous sinus surgery (Y,N), nasal polyp status (present, 
absent), treatment (OPN -375 186 µg, OPN -375 372 µg, placebo), and baseline APOV. 
 Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
Change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_400326] term for protocol (CS -3205, CS -3206).  
The frequency of acute sinus exacerbations over 24 weeks will be compared between OPN -375 dose groups 
and placebo using generalized linear model (GLM) for data from the negative  binomial distribution that is 
commonly referred to as the negative binomial (NB) regression model. The NB model will include the same 
model terms as the primary models; in additional, the model will include a categorical effect for protocol (CS -
3205, CS -3206), and the logarithm of follow -up time as an offset variable.  
 
Safety Analysis:  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical inference procedures will be applied . All safety 
summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_324314] -375 dose level (186 μg  and 372 μ g) and total  OPN -375, and placebo .

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
OptiNose has developed OPN-375 (proprietary name [CONTACT_324365]®) as an intranasal drug delivery 
system with the intention to improve the performance of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_324260] . Deli very of drug using an  Exhalation Delivery System (EDS) is intended 
to improve reproducibility of nasal delivery, particularly deposition of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_324261] (ostiomeatal complex  [OMC]) . OPN-375 is 
also intended to address user preference associated with reduced drip-out (posterior and anterior) and taste, and to improve tolerability and efficiency by [CONTACT_324318] (GI) tract an d lungs. 
Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_324262], high selectivity,  
and affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, low oral and nasal systemic absorption, and rapid metabolic clearance ( Crim 2001). It is approved in many countries for use in the treatment of 
dermatosis (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]), rhinitis (intranasal), and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (inhaled) and is one of the most well studied and characterized glucocorticoids in clinical use today.  
Information  available on OPN-375 for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with and 
without nasal polyposis is summarized in the following sections. For the most comprehensive information on the safety and efficacy of OPN-[ADDRESS_400344] recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
The terms " Sponsor" or “designee” used throughout this document refers to those companies or

 1.1 Background 
A clinical development program for OPN-375 (XHANCE) in adults with nasal polyposis has 
been completed . XHANCE  is currently approved for the treatment of nasal polyps in patients [ADDRESS_400345] of this protocol, OptiNose intends to study the 
efficacy and safety of OPN-375 in subjec ts with CRS . 
Sinusitis is defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. If the 
duration of sinusitis is more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations, it is deemed to 
be CRS  (Bachert et al, 2014 ; Fokkens et al, 2012). It is variously estimated that approximately 
4% of patients with CRS  have concurrent nasal polyps (with estimated prevalence in the low, 
single digits for the population as a whole). Chronic rhinosinusitis affects approximately 5% to 15% of the general population in Europe and the [LOCATION_002] (US) ( Hamilos, 2011), and the 
prevalence of physician -diagnosed CRS  was found to be 2% to 4% ( Chen et al, 2003; Shashy et 
al, 2004). Chronic rhinosinusitis has significant impact on healthcare resource utilization  and 
work productivity, with approximately [ADDRESS_400346] productivity in 2016 ( Rudmik 2017). Chronic rhinosinusitis also has a significant 
impact on health -related quality of life, and patients with this condition scored lower on 
measures of bodily pain and social functioning than those with serious chronic conditions including angina, back pain, congestive heart failure, and COPD ( Gliklich and Metson, 1995).

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  The etiology and pathogenesis of CRS  is multifactorial. Although a number of factors have been 
found to be associated with CRS , including ciliary impairment, allergy, asthma, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59433], and an immunocompromised state, there is no clearly delineated single molecular 
pathway or single antecedent trigger that leads to the development of CRS . Nevertheless, 
persistent inflammation of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses, progressing from mucosal injury to tissue change, is sine qua non in the pathophysiology of CRS  with or without nasal 
polyps ( Akdis et al, 2013). Evidence of inflammation is generally present throughout the nasal 
cavity, including around the OMC , where the sinuses ventilate and drain into the nasal cavity.  
Consistent with the location of the inflammation, the most common symptom associated with CRS  is nasal obstruction, followed by [CONTACT_324319]- pressure/pain -fullness, discolored 
anterior and posterior nasal discharge, and hyposo mia. The presence of 2 or  more symptoms, 1 
of which should be nasal obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, persisting beyond 12 weeks, is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of CRS  (Meltzer et al, 2004 ). However, diagnosis based on 
symptoms alone is relatively nonspecific. Visualization of discharge from the OMC  by [CONTACT_324320], the presence of polyps in the nasal cavity, or radiographic imaging showing inflammation of the paranasal sinuses is typi[INVESTIGATOR_324263] t he 
diagnosis ( Bhattacharyya and Lee, 2010 ). 
Intranasal topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], though not formally indicated, are first-line pharmacotherapy for CRS  with or without nasal polyps ( Bachert et al,  2014; Fokkens et al, 2012; Rosenfeld et al, 
2015). Qualitative syntheses and meta-analyses have been performed on the reported clinical trials in patients without nasal polyps (10 and 7 trials for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis, respectively) and in patients with nasal polyps (38 and 26 trials for qualitative synthesis and meta -analysis, respectively) ( Fokkens et al, 2012). The studies included patients with prior sinus 
surgery, without sinus surgery, or a mixed population with regard to sinus surgery. The meta-analyses demonstrated that treatment with intranasal corticosteroids improved symptoms to a greater extent than placebo in CRS  patients both with and without nasal polyps. However, the 
efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in CRS  patients without nasal polyps was modest, with 
several of the trials failing to demonstrate a significant treatment effect compared with placebo. It is also notable that amo ng the CRS  patients without nasal polyps only those who had prior 
sinus surgery showed symptomatic improvement. Adverse events associated with intranasal corticosteroids generally were local at the site of administration, not serious, and consisted mainly of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], nasal irritation and headache ( Fokkens et al, 2012).  
Clinical guidelines suggest that for patients who do not respond to intranasal corticosteroids after 3 months of treatment, a course of systemic antibiotic treatment may be considered.  
Endoscopic sinus surgery is generally effective in reducing the symptoms of CRS  with or 
without nasal polyps ( Chester et al, 2009); however, the 5- year revision rate for surgery 
approaches 20%, with the revision rate generally being higher for patients with CRS  with nasal 
polyps (21% vs 16%) than for those without nasal polyps ( Hopkins et al, 2009). Furthermore, 
although surgery is effective, the insufficiency of symptomatic relief with surgery is strongly 
suggested by [CONTACT_324321] ( Bhattacharyya and Lee, 2010).  
Clinical guidelines notwithstanding, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_324264], it is notable that in th e US , no intranasal corticosteroid has been approved for the treatment of

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  CRS . Oral steroids may reduce the need for surgery but there are concerns about significant side 
effects with long -term oral steroid use.  
OPN-375 contains a liquid suspension of fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_324265] a drug delivery system designed to deposit the drug aerosol high and deep into the nasal cavity . Fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_28321] a synthetic corticosteroid that has long been commercially 
available in the US . It is currently approved as monotherapy and in various combinations, and in

OPN-[ADDRESS_400347] metering spray pump, and plastic casework with an asymmetrically shaped sealing nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_235712] a flexible mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. The casework defines the drug delivery system’s outer shape and includes the moveable mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_324266]. T he user inserts the sealing nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_324267]  
1 nostril,  so it seals well with the flexible nasal tissues, and inserts the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_324268]. After taking a deep breath, the user blows into the OPN-375 mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Static positive 
pressure is created and subsequently released through the actuation of the spray by [CONTACT_324322], which concurrently releases the orally -generated pressure/airflow . Blowing through the 
mouth against a resistance also causes the soft palate to seal closed, separating the oral cavity from the nasal cavities. A nasal spray applicator extends from the metering pump to the tip of the 
nosepi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Upon actuation, the design of the EDS allows for air to be channeled from the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_324269] . Under these conditions, exhaled 
air creates a po sitive intranasal pressure, accompanies the aerosol expelled by [CONTACT_324323], and places at least 50% of the initially deposited metered spray beyond the head of the inferior turbinate and at least 30% of the initially deposited dose in the upper posterior region of the nasal cavity beyond the head of the inferior turbinate and above the inferior meatus, including the OMC  (middle meatus) .

 1.2 Clinical Experience 
There were two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multicenter studies (OPN -FLU -NP-3101 and OPN- FLU -NP-3102) designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of 3 doses of OPN-375 (93, 186, and 372 μg  twice a day  [BID]) compared 
with placebo in adult subjects with bilateral nasal polyposis followed by [CONTACT_1629] 8- week open -label 
extension phase (372 μg BID) t o assess safety. Both clinical studies were identical in design.  
In these studies, all  3 dos es of OPN-375 produced statistically significant greater reductions than 
placebo on the co-primary measures of nasal congestion/obstruction and total polyp grade. Sensitivity analyses conducted on the co-primary outcome variables, including a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_324271], Inc. Confidential and Propr ietary  
Protocol Number OPN -FLU -CS-3205  
 
 Page 32 of 85 
 
Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  analysis, indicated that the results obtained were robust. The 186-µg and 372-µg groups had 
numerically larger magnitudes of effect compared with the 93-µg group.  
Results obtained from secondary measures in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_324272] . In the open-label phases of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518], the improvements from 
baseline in efficacy assessments seen at the end of the double-blind phases generally continued to increase through W eek 24. Data from responder analyses demonstrate that OPN-375 
substantially reduces polyp grade and the magnitude of reduction continues to increase with longer- term treatment within the period studied.  
Clinically meaningful improvements with OPN-375 treatment were also observed broadly in other signs and symptoms of the disease and in physical, mood, and social  parameters relevant to 
quality of life . Analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) indicated that 
treatment with OPN-[ADDRESS_400350] was clinically meaningful. 
There were two  Phase 3, open- label, multicenter studies (OPN -FLU -CS-3203, 12-month; OPN-
FLU -CS-3204, 3-month) designed to assess the safety and efficacy of OPN -375 372 μg BID in 
subjects with chronic sinusitis with or without nasal polyps. Subjects in the open-label studies also had considerable improvement in symptoms and in 
objectively observed local signs of disease. A substantial proportion of subjects with intranasal edema at study entry no longer had evidence of edema on examination at study completion, a finding consistent with an intranasal deposition profile that places topi[INVESTIGATOR_897]- acting fluticasone 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_324273]/OMC . In 
subjects with polyps, extensive reductions in polyp grade were observed and polyps were eliminated from at least 1 side of the nose in approximately 50%  of subjects. In the 12-month 
study the improvement in polyp grade, polyp elimination, and edema increased over time, suggesting benefit with continued treatment over the observed period.  
The most commonly reported adverse events ( AEs) in the active treatment groups were 
associated with local effects at the site of administration in the nasal cavity (epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], nasal 
congestion, nasal mucosal disorder [primarily erythema], and nasal septum ulceration) or associated with the underlying disease (acute sinusitis or nasopharyngitis). Most local AEs were identified as a result of intensive active monitoring of all subjects at scheduled intervals by [CONTACT_324324]. The majority of these AEs were mild and importantly, are known to have resolved with continued use 
of study drug. No deaths were reported, 18 subjects receiving OPN-375 reported serious adverse 
events ( SAE s) during the placebo controlled and open- label studies . One placebo -treated subject 
reported treatment -related SAEs, and the overall rate of discontinuations due to AEs was 
approximately 4% among all subjects who received OPN-375.

may be reduced, patients are often left with symptoms due to the suboptimal delivery method of 
current treatments ( Fokkens et al, 2012). Standard nasal spray pumps suffer from a number of 
drawbacks and are considered suboptimal for reliable drug delivery to target sites beyond the

provides specific benefits over current nasal drug delivery systems including increased reliability 
of delivery of topi[INVESTIGATOR_324274] , which are central to the pathology of 
CRS .

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Study Overview  
This is a 24- week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal administration of OPN-375 
(186 and  372 μg twice daily) in subjects with CRS  with or without the presence of nasal polyps.  
Subjects must sign an informed consent before any study-related procedure is performed. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will enter a 7- to  21-day single-blind 
placebo run -in period to determine disease status and to ensure that they can comply with study 
procedures. At Visit 1 (Screening), nasoendoscopy- related (nasal examination  and assessment of 
nasal cavity for presence of edema, polyps, or mucopurulence) procedures will be performed  for 
all subjects . During the single-blind run -in period, subjects will administer morning and evening 
doses of the study drug (placebo) and will complete a daily diary (electronic) immediately before the morning and evening doses including recording of both instantaneous (evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) and reflective (evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours) scores for nasal symptoms. 
Subjects determined to meet diary eligibility criteria over a [ADDRESS_400354] a sinus computed tomography ( CT) scan performed . 
The CT scan should be performed after diary eligibility is confirmed and prior to Day  [ADDRESS_400355] scan standards outlined 
in the Imaging Charter for this protocol. The resultant scan will be reviewed centrally to  confirm 
study eligibility  prior to randomization. 
Those subjects meeting disease severity eligibility criteria (symptom severity and sinus opacification) will be randomly assigned through an interactive web response system (IWRS) to receive 1  of 2 active treatments  or placebo : 186 or 372 μg of OPN-375 or placebo BID  for the 
24-week double- blind treatment phase. When the number of subjects with polyps reaches 50% of 
the total population, no additional subjects with polyps will be enrolled. During the first [ADDRESS_400356] to capture symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal discharge, (anterior and/or posterior), facial pain or pressure sensation, and sense of smell, as well as use of approved rescue medication after the Week [ADDRESS_400357]-completed questionnaires will be used t o measure the 
symptoms and social/emotional consequences of the subject’s nasal disorder (SNOT- 22), health -
related quality of life (EQ -5D, SF -36v2, and SF-6D), sleep quality and disturbances ( PSQI ), 
depressive symptoms (QID), work productivity, and objective smell test (SIT) . Subjects will 
assess their global impression of change since starting the study drug using the PGIC scale. Health economic information related to CRS  will also be collected  (HPQ) . Objective changes in 
disease severity will be assessed via sinus CT  scan . 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_324332], performing nasal examination , measuring vital 
signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse) and weight, and through collection of information for concomitant medications.  
Refer to the Schedule of Study Procedures and Evaluations , for the timing of all tests, 
procedures, and assessments that will be performed during the study.

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  6 VISIT SCHEDULE SUMMARY  
Procedures to be performed at each study visit, and the visit time windows, are indicated in the 
Schedule of Study Procedures and Evaluations . Additional information related to the individual 
study visits is presented belo w: 
• CT scans are required at Baseline and Week 24/ ET to evaluate eligibility criteria and primary 
and secondary endpoints. All CT scans will be sent to a central imaging core lab for review and analysis. The baseline CT scan should be performed after all other  screening assessments 
are completed  for subjects who remain eligible (unless utilizing CT scan performed within 
14-days prior to Visit 1). 
• Subjects who develop an acute upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], acute sinusitis , influ enza or 
SAR S CoV-2 (COVID-19) during t he study must be symptom free for at least 28 days prior to 
undergoing the Week  24/EOS  CT scan . Subjects should continue treatment with study 
medication until EOS CT scan  can be completed.  
• For the Week  [ADDRESS_400376] scan  cannot be performed on the 
same day as the study visit, they should be performed before the on site study visit. 
 
6.1 Visit 1 (Screening/Single -blind Placebo Run -in) 
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will undergo all Visit 1 (Screening) procedures to determine study eligibility. 
Subjects will be instructed on the use of OPN-375. They will then be provided with an EDS  to 
practice administration of a dose and to assure that they can correctly use OPN-375 (eg, able to 
obtain a seal, sequence). The assignment of a kit number for the practice EDS  is not performed 
by [CONTACT_10966];  rather, the study staff will dispense a practice EDS  kit and record the kit number in the 
drug dispensing log. This kit is only to be used  at the site at Visit 1 (Screening) and is not to be 
sent home with the subject.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will enter a  7- to 21- day, 
single-blind, placebo run -in period to confirm symptom severity  and to ensure that they can 
comply with study procedures. Subjects will be given a single-blind placebo drug kit (containing 
2 placebo  units) assigned through the IWRS and an electronic diary and will be instructed on 
their use.  
During the single-blind run- in period, subjects will administer morning and evening doses of the 
study drug (placebo) as described in Section  5.1. Subjects will be required to keep a daily diary 
of nasal symptoms. The electronic diary will be completed immediately before the morning and 
evening doses and will include recording of both instantaneous (evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) and reflective (evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours) scores for nasal symptoms (see Section  7.2). Subjects will be instructed that 
the use of rescue medication for CRS symptoms is not allowed. Subjects will be instructed to 
bring the single-blind placebo drug kit and the diary with them to their next visit (Visit 2, Day 1 [Baseline]).  
The site staff will monitor the electronic diary transmission reports to ensure that subjects are recording both morning and evening nasal symptoms and that the data are being transmitted to

completion of the electronic diaries . The  site staff will evaluate the  subject’s severity scores , 
entered  remotely  into the electronic diaries , and will be notified  when the subject meets 
eligibility criteria pertaining to their symptoms . When  a subject reaches  an average congestion 
severity score of  at least  1.[ADDRESS_400377] scan standards outlined in the Imaging Charter for this protocol. 
 
6.2 Visit 2 (Day 1, Baseline; Randomization) 
Once it is confirmed that the eligibility criteria based on the CT scan  are met, the remainder of 
study procedures should be performed.  Subjects who then meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 2, Day 1 (Baseline) will be randomly 
assigned through the IWRS to 1 of 3 arms : 186 or 372 μg of  OPN-375 BID , or placebo BID . 
Study drug will be administered as described in Section  5.1. Subjects will be given 
1 double-blind study drug kit (containing 2 devices) assigned through the IWRS and an electronic diary and will be instructed on their use. Subjects will be instructed to bring the study drug kits and diary with them to their next visit.  
Subjects will be required to keep a n electronic daily diary of nasal symptoms. The diary will be 
completed immediately before the mornin g and evening doses and will include recording of both 
instantaneous and reflective scores for nasal symptoms (see Section  7.2). Subjects will be 
instructed that the use rescue medication for CRS symptoms is not allowed. 
The site staff will monitor the electronic diary transmission reports to ensure that subjects are 
recording both morning and evening nasal symptoms and that the data are being transmi tted to 
the data base. Site staff should follow-up with subjects as necessary to counsel them on completion of the electronic diaries.

7.2 Efficacy A ssessment s 
Electronic diaries will be used by [CONTACT_324344]-blind placebo run- in period and 
double- blind treatment phase  in this study to capture daily nasal symptoms (ie, symptom scores 
for nasal congestion, nasal discharge [anterior and/or posterior], facial pain or pressure sensation, 
and sense of smell) and the use of approved rescue medication after the Week  4 visit through 
Week 12 of the double-blind phase. The Schedule of Study Procedures and Evaluations  indicates 
the timing of all assessments; further information on each evaluation is provided below.  
The electronic d iaries will be preprogrammed to transmit subject-entered data daily to the 
electronic diary data base. The site staff will monitor the electronic diary transmission reports to 
ensure that subjects are recording both morning and evening nasal symptoms and r escue 
medication use and that the data are being transmitted to the data base. Site staff should follow-up with subjects as necessary to counsel them on completion of the electronic diaries. 
Additional information on the nasal examination can be found in S ection  7.4.2. 
The following efficacy evaluations will be performed: 
• At Visit 1 (Screening), study personnel should provide each subject with the description for 
each symptom severity (ie, mild, moderate, severe) using the definitions provided in Table 2. Each subject will then be asked to provide the severity of their nasal symptoms, on average, over the past [ADDRESS_400384] moderate severity of nasal symptoms to enter the study. 
• An electronic diary will be provided to each subject. Subjects will be instructed to complete the electronic diary twice daily immediately before dosing (morning and evening) during the single-blind placebo run -in period (for eligibility) and during the first 12  weeks of the double-
blind treatment phase. Subjects will report both instantaneous (evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) and reflective (evaluation of symptom severity over the past 12 hours) scores for:  
− nasal congestion symptoms, nasal discharge ( anterior and/or posterior) symptoms, 
and facial pain or pressure sensation symptoms, scored on the scale in Table 2 .

period preceding Visit 1 (Screening).  
Note: Sense of smell, scored as 0=normal, 1=slightly impaired, 2=moderately impaired, 3=absent.  
• SNOT -[ADDRESS_400385]-completed questionnaire that consists of 22 symptoms and 
social/emotional consequences of their nasal disorder. Each item is rated as follows: 0=no 
problem, 1=very mild problem, 2=mild or slight problem, 3=moderate problem, 4=severe problem, 5=problem as bad as it can be. The SNOT-22 is validated in CRS  (Hopkins 2009). 
The recall period is the past 2  weeks. The SNOT -22 takes approximately 5 minutes to 
complete.  
• Recording of each dose of approved rescue medication after the Week  4 visit through Week 
12 
• The EQ -5D consists of 2 pages: the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS) . The descriptive system comprises  5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The subjec t is 
asked to indicate his/her health state by [CONTACT_324346] 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension . The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5- digit 
number that describes the subjec t’s health state.  The EQ VAS records the subjec t’s self -rated 
health on a vertical VAS , where the endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ 
and ‘The worst health you can imagine’. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the subject’s own judgement. The EQ -5D takes 1 -2 minutes to 
complete . 
• SF-36v2 is a multipurpose, 36- item subject-completed validated questionnaire that measures 
8 domains of health: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The SF -36v2 survey with a 4- week  recall  will be used. It yields 
scale scores for each of these 8 health domains, and 2 summary measures of physical and mental health: the PCS and MCS. The SF -36v2 takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

symptom domains designated by [CONTACT_324347] l Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition to diagnose a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The 7-day period prior to assessment is the usual time frame for assessing symptom severity. The psychometric properties of the QIDS, has  been established in various study samples. The 
time required to complete the QIDS is approximately 2-4 minutes. 
• SIT is a t est comprised of 4  booklets each containing 10 microencapsulated (scratch and sniff) 
odors. Forced choice response alternatives accompany each test item . The test provides an 
absolute indication of smell loss (anosmia; mild, moderate or severe hyposomia ) as well as an 
index to detect malingering. The test is self -administered and takes 10 -15 minutes. 
• Acute exacerbations of CRS  are defined as worsening of symptoms requiring antibiotic or 
corticosteroid use , specifically: 
− an event characterized by [CONTACT_324348]  (listed below), lasting at least 3  days, that cause the subjec t to seek 
medical care:  
 facial pain or pressure  
 nasal congestion/blockage  
 rhinorrhea  
 reduction in sense of smell  
AND  
− escalation of treatment , defined as either initiation of antibiotics or oral steroids, or 
the escalation of treatment involving an unscheduled acute care visit ( eg, emergency 
room or acute care outpatient clinic) or inpatient care, for increased symptoms of CRS  or for acute sinus itis. 
*If an exacerbation start date is less than 7 days after the end dat e of a previous 
exacerbation, the entire period will be treated as a single exacerbation.  
• Antibiotic use for acute sinusitis during study participation will be captured. 
• Assessments from CT scan  will be performed for both the baseline CT scan and  the 
Week  24/ET (Visit 6) CT scan

questioning. All non-serious AEs are to be followed until the subject completes the study or is lost to follow -up. 
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies is crucial for the protection of subjects, is the responsibility of the investigators and the Sponsor, and is mandated by [CONTACT_169687] y agencies worldwide.  
Each AE is to be documented on the CRF with reference to intensity, date of occurrence, duration, frequency, treatment, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or non-serious. Additionally, the investigator has to assess whether the AE is drug related (adverse drug reaction) or not. Changes of AE s and dates 
of ending have to be documented on the CRF. 
Surgical procedures, planned before enrollment of the subject in the study, are not considered 
AEs if the condition(s) was (were) known before study inclusion. In the latter case, the medical condition should be reported in the subject’s medical history. 
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the subject gives informed consent until completion of the end-of-study visit or an early  
termination  visit. SAEs will be reported through [ADDRESS_400393] dose of study drug 
administration.  
The maximum severity (intensity) of the AE will be categorized by [CONTACT_324353] 6 .

8.2 Adverse Reactions  
An AE is considered related to study drug (adverse reaction) if there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the treatment and the AE.  
 
8.3 Suspected Adverse Reactions  
“Suspected adverse reactions” means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. A “suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction” which means any AE caused by a drug. 
An AE is considered to be a suspected adverse reaction if: 
• The AE is a single occurrence of an uncommon AE that is known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure ( eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome).  
• The AE occurs 1 or more times and is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug ( eg, tendon rupture).  
• The AE is part of an aggregate analysis of specific AEs observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those AEs  occur more freq uently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group.  
Suspected adverse reactions are the subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. Inherent in this definition and in the requirement to report them, is the need for the Sponsor to evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the 
likelihood that the drug actually caused the AE.  
 8.4 Unexpected Adverse Reactions or Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “ Unexpected, ” as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions  that are mentioned in the IB as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
The suspected adverse reaction s listed in the IB ( ie, “expected”) are those observed with the 
investigational drug and for which a causal relationship between the event and the drug is 
suspected or confirmed. Thus, A Es that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease 
process are considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  in the IB. Additionally, AEs that are listed in the IB as occurring with the same class of drugs, or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, even though they have not been 
observed with the drug under investigation, will be considered unexpected until they have been 
observed with the drug under investigation.  
 8.5 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if at any dosage, in the view of 
either the investigator or Sponsor , it meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• is fatal  
• is life -threatening  
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE. S ince SAEs are critically important for the identification of 
significant safety problems, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the Sponsor ’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, t he 
event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or their designee within 24 hours after the investigator 
becomes aware of the event, along with a determination as to whether  it is associated with the 
study drug, device, or procedure.  
8.5.1 Life-Threatening Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at i mmediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. As with the definition of serious, the determination of whether an AE is life-threatening can be based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28216]. Thus, if either believes that it meets the definition of life -threatening, it must be considered life-threatening for 
reporting purposes.

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  Note: If the contact [CONTACT_324354], written 
notification will be provided by [CONTACT_324355], and a protocol amendment will not be required. 
It is imperative that [COMPANY_003] be informed within 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of a 
SAE so that reporting to the Regulatory Agencies can be met within the required time frame (7 or 15 calendar days).  
Because of the need to report to health authorities all SAEs in a timely manner, i t is vitally 
important that an investigator report any AEs that would be considered serious within 24 hours, even if the investigator does not consider the AE to be clinically significant or drug- related.  
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of relationship to study drug) that occurs within [ADDRESS_400396]’s participation in the study, are to be followed until either: the AE resolves, the AE stabilizes, the AE returns to baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or it is shown that the AE is not attributable to the study drug or study conduct. 
Medical and scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as for important medical events that were not immediately life-threatening or did not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324295].

The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The investigator should notify the Sponsor or their designee of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-up Pregnancy Report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (eg , spontaneous or 
therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381]/emailing a completed SAE form to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A detailed  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This 
document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives. S tatistical analysis princ iples to address all study 
objectives  are provided below. 
 
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample size assumptions were generated based on previous Phase 3 studies of OPN-375 in 
subjects with nasal polyposis and data from a study evaluating the change in maxillary and ethmoid opacification in CRS  patients treated with a n intramuscular dose of triamcinolone 
(Pallanch 2013). Based on the results for changes from baseline in morning symptoms among 
subjects with nasal polyps in the previous studies conducted with OPN-375, a sample of 111 subjects per group (333 total subjects) is sufficient to detect a 0.8  scale difference in 
morning symptoms score between treatments (OPN-375 vs placebo) using a 2- sided test at the 
5% significance level with 88% power, and assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.9. This sample size is also adequate to detect an 11.3% difference between treatments in average percent opacification using a 2- sided test at the 5%  significance level with 88% power, and assuming a 
SD of 27 percent. Approximately 333 subjects (111 subjects per group) will be randomized to have at least 120 subjects without nasal polyps be included. The sample size was estimated for the co -primary efficacy endpoints using Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (PASS 15) 
(NCSS, 2017).  
 
9.2 Analysis Sets 
9.2.1 Intent -to-treat Analysis Set  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) anal ysis set will include all subjects who are randomized  regardless of 
whether they received double- blind treatment.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_400398] one dose of 
randomized study drug. The treatment group assignment in this population will be defined by [CONTACT_115378]. The safety population will be used for the analysis of safety. 
9.2.3 Full Analys is Set (FAS) 
The FAS will include all subjects in the ITT set  who receive at least one dose of randomized 
study drug during the double- blinded treatment phase and have at least one baseline efficacy 
measure for APOV endpoint, and also have a baseline value and at least one post- baseline value 
(7-day average AM instantaneous CSNS  score) on or before Week 4 (i.e., Week 2 and/or Week 
4) for the CSNS endpoint. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized.  
The FAS population will be the primary study population for all efficacy analyses in this study.

 Page 66 of 85 
 
Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  9.2.4 Per-Protocol Analysis Set (PPS)  
The PPS analysis set excludes subjects from the FAS population due to major protocol 
deviations with potential to substantively affect the results of the primary efficacy analysis. The PPS population will be used for a sensitivity analysis for primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Determination of the major protocol deviations will be made prior to unblinding of the database 
and documented in a separate report.  
 
9.3 Primary Estimand , Intercurrent Events,  and Estimation 
Primary Objective and Population: The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of intranasal 
administration of twice -daily doses of 186 and 372 µg of OPN-375 (fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) with 
placebo in subjects with documented CRS with or without nasal polyps. 
9.3.1 Co-primary Endpoints  
• Change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in 7- day average instantaneous AM CSNS  
(evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring): 
− nasal  congestion 
− nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior) 
− facial pain or pressure sensation  
 
The baseline CSNS will be the average of the CSNS over the last 7 days of the placebo run-in period prior to randomization. The CSNS at Week 4 will be the average of the CSNS over the 7 days prior to nominal Study Day 28. 
AND  
• Change from baseline to Week 24/ET in the APOV in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses (APOV is the average percentage of volume opacified across both maxillary and ethmoid 
sinuses (all 4 sinuses) at each time  point) 
9.3.2 Potential Intercurrent Events  
The potential intercurrent events  are as follo ws:  
1. Need for systemic corticosteroids  for CRS exacerbation or worsening of CRS nasal/sinus 
symptoms 
2. Need for nasal surgery  
3. Discontinuation from study treatment 
9.3.3 Primary E stimand 
The primary efficacy estimand is the difference between each active treatment of twice -daily 
doses of 186 µg  and 372 µg of OPN-375 and placebo for each of the co -primary endpoints.  
For the primary estimand, intercurrent events will be addressed as follows:

Protocol Number OPN -FLU -CS-3205  
 
 Page 67 of 85 
 
Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  1. Systemic corticosteroids use for CRS exacerbation or worsening of CRS nasal/sinus 
symptoms: a composite strategy will be employed with a poor score assigned to this event. 
− For CSNS, a value of ‘9’ will be assigned. For APOV, a poor score is defined as follows: for a subject with a baseline APOV ≥ 75%, a value of ‘100%’ is assigned; if baseline APOV < 75%, a poor score is defined as baseline APOV + 25%. The rationale for assignment of a poor score is provided in the SAP. Also, further detail regarding the handling of a missing within- instrument data in these 
endpoints is provided in the SAP. 
− Systemic corticosteroid use for other indications will be considered a treatment and study discontinuation event (reference criteria 3). 
2. Nasal surgery: composite strategy with poor scores assigned as  above.  
3. Treatment Discontinua tion: treatment policy strategy; subjects may continue in the study 
until one of the following three mutually exclusive outcomes: 
a. Subject completes Week 24/ET CT scan. In the absence of an intercurrent event (systemic corticosteroids, nasal surgery) use th e endpoint value; 
b. An intercurrent event (systemic corticosteroids for CRS exacerbation or worsening of CRS nasal/sinus symptoms, nasal surgery) occurs: U se composite 
strategy and assign poor score as described above (reference criteria 1,2);  
c. Subject discontinues the study. Missing data due to study discontinuation following treatment discontinuation will be imputed; further detail on the imputation method is provided in the estimation section for each of the co-primary endpoints. 
 
9.3.4 Estimator and Estimation Method - Primary Analysis 
Estimator and estimation method  (CSNS) : For the co-primary endpoint CSNS, the estimator is 
the mean difference between treatments (active versus placebo) in change from baseline to the end of Week  4 in the 7- day average total instantaneous AM CSNS.  Estimation is based on a 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM)  where changes from baseline to  Weeks 2, 4 in the 
7-day average total instantaneous AM CSNS, respectively, are the repeated measures. The 
MMRM mode l will employ  Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) for parameter estimation 
and the Kenward -Roger method for calculating the denominator degrees of freedom. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to estimate within -subject error.  For the treatment 
policy estimand, (reference Section 9.3.3, criteria 3c), missing data due to study discontinuation will be estimated within the MMRM model under the assumption that the missing data are missing at random (MAR) and that early discontinuation from the study (prior to Week 4) is unlikely to reflect a treatment effect.  
The MMRM model will include categorical effects for  previous sinus surgery (Y, N), nasal 
polyp status (present, absent), treatment ( OPN-375 186 µg, OPN-375 372 µg, placebo), week (2, 
4), treatment -by-day interaction, and the continuous covariate baseline 7- day average total 
instantaneous AM CSNS with baseline -by-week  interaction.

 Page 68 of 85 
 
Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  Estimator and estimation method (APOV) : For the co -primary endpoint APOV, the estimator is 
the mean difference between treatments (active versus placebo) in the change from baseline to 
Week  24/ET APOV.  Estimation is based on an ANCOVA model including categorical effects 
for previous sinus surgery (Y, N), nasal polyp status (present, absent), treatment (OPN-375 186 µg, OPN-375 372 µg, placebo), and baseline APOV.  
For the treatment policy estimand, (reference Section 9.3.3, criteria 3,c), missing data due to study discontinuation will be imputed with a pattern mixture model (PMM) multiple imputation (MI) using the Jump–to -Control (J2C) method. The PMM assumes that the missing 
data at Week 24/ET on the control arm (placebo) is MAR, and the missing data on the active treatment arms have the profile of the control arm at Week 24/ET.  
Multiple imputation using a PMM with J2C method will be conducted using the sequent ial 
modeling method as described in ( O’Kelly  et al, 2014). Further detail on the MI implementation, 
and statistical analysis and inference is provided in the SAP.  
9.3.5 Supplementary  Analysis 
A supplementary analysis of the primary e stimand will be performed.  
Supplementary  estimand:  A supplementary efficacy estimand is the difference between each 
active treatment of twice -daily doses of 186 µg and 372 µg of OPN-375 and placebo in e ach of 
the co -primary endpoints, irrespective of systemic corticosteroid use.  
That is, for the supplemental estimand, intercurrent events will be addressed as follows: 
1. Systemic corticosteroids use for all indications: treatment policy strategy; consider outcomes 
irrespective  of systemic corticosteroid  use; subjects may continue in the study until one of the 
following two mutually exclusive outcomes:  
a. Subject completes the study, use the endpoint value; 
b. Subject discontinues the study. Missing data due to study discontinuation following treatment discontinuation will be imputed; further detail on the imputation method is provided in the estimation section for each of the co- primary endpoints. 
2. Nasal surgery: composite strategy with poor scores assigned. 
3. Treatment discontinuation: composite strategy with poor scores assigned.  
The estimator and estimation methods for the co -primary endpoints , as well as the assignment of 
poor scores, are the same as for the primary estimand described above.  
9.[ADDRESS_400399] score of 100% is assigned; for the treatment policy strategy, baseline APOV is assigned (BOCF). Baseline and endpoint APOV values are then ranked. Ranked APOV values will be analyzed with an ANCOVA model including categorical effects for previous sinus surgery and treatment. The method described by [CONTACT_324356], et. al. (1982) using extended Mantel-
Haenszel statistics will be used to perform nonparametric treatment comparisons, adjusting for

Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_324296]. 
 9.5 Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  - Pooling of Study 3205 and Study 3206  
The following analyses are based on the key secondary endpoints which are defined by [CONTACT_324357]- FLU -CS-3205 and Study OPN- FLU -CS-3206; further details are 
provided in the SAP: 
• Change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_400401] term for protocol (CS -3205, CS-3206). 
• The frequency of acute sinus exacerbations over 24 weeks will be compared between OPN-375 dose groups and placebo using generalized linear model (GLM) for data from the negative binomial distribution that is commonly referred to as the negative binomial (NB) regression model. The NB model will include the same model terms as the primary models; in additional, the model will include a categorical effect for protocol (CS -3205, CS-3206), 
and the logarithm of follow- up time as an offset variable.  
 
9.6 Other Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
All statistical analyses in this section that reference the primary MMRM and ANCOVA models 
described in Section 9.3.4 will include the same factors as  their respective primary models, 
except for the baseline covariate. The baseline covariate for the specific endpoint will be used, unless otherwise specified. 
In addition, a combined dose group (OPN- 375 186 μg, OPN -375 372 μg) is defined in all models 
of primary and secondary endpoints by [CONTACT_324358], assigning equal 
weight to each dose, to obtain the inferential statistics for combined doses, and for the comparison: combined dose versus placebo. 
Intercurrent events for secondary endpoints will be addressed as described in Section 9.3.3 for 
the primary estimand, unless otherwise indicated, and poor scores assigned to secondary endpoints are defined in the SAP. For the treatment policy estimand, missing data due to study discontinuation will be handled as described in Section 9.3.4 for the primary MMRM and ANCOVA models, respectively.

2. Test each co -primary endpoint for OPN-375 low dose (186 μg) vs placebo:  If p < 0.[ADDRESS_400407] key secondary endpoints; otherwise, stop. 
There are two  comparisons for each dose: OPN-375 high dose (372 μg) vs placebo and OPN -375 
low dose (186 μg) vs placebo. The order of the testing is as follows:  
1. OPN-375 372 μg versus placebo in the change from baseline in the 7 -day average 
instantaneous AM CSNS at the end of Week 4  
2. OPN-375 372 μg versus placebo in the APOV in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses change 
from baseline to Week  24/ET 
3. OPN-375 186 μg versus placebo in the change from baseline in the 7 -day average 
instantaneous AM CSNS at the end of Week 4 
4. OPN-375 186 μg versus placebo in the APOV in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses change from baseline to Week  24/ET

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  9.9.1 Adverse Events  (AEs)  
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 20 or higher. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with 
onset dates on or after the start of double-blind study drug. The incidence of TEAEs during the study period will be tabulated by [CONTACT_262192] (or System Organ Class [SOC] and preferred term) overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_324359] . Those AEs with missing onset dates or missing severity will be included as 
treatment -emergent. If an AE is reported more than once during the double-blind study phase, 
the greatest severity and the worst -case attribution will be used for presentation in tables. 
Deaths, SAEs, and AEs causing discontinuation of study participation and /or study treatment will be tabulated by [CONTACT_324360]. Adverse events for individual subjects will be listed, along with information regarding onset, duration, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
9.9.2 Other Safety Endpoints  
Baseline physical exam ination findings and clinical laboratory data will be summarized. Vital 
signs and weight will be summarized using descriptive statistics including mean values and change from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with values outside limits of the normal range at each time point. 
Prior/ concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary (WHODrug), Version December [ADDRESS_400408] counts and percent. 
 9.10 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis is planned  for both co-primary endpoints in this study to evaluate the sample 
size assum ptions as follows:  
1. A blinded, pooled IA of co- primary endpoint change from baseline in the 7- day average 
instantaneous AM CSNS to assess the variance. This IA is planned to occur when 
approximately 50% of randomized subjects have reached Week [ADDRESS_400409].  
2. A blinded, pooled IA of co- primary en dpoint change from baseline to Week 24/ET APOV to 
assess variance. This IA is planned  to occur after approximately one-third of randomized 
subjects have completed the study (Week 24/ET). Based on the results of this blinded IA of APOV, an unblinded IA of APOV to assess the conditional probability of rejecting the null hypothesis at the end of the study, given the observed interim result (Conditional Power), will be considered according to the following decision criteria: 
a. If SD <= 29.7%, (i.e. within 10% of target), then no unblinded IA will be performed. 
b. If observed SD > 29.7%, then perform unblinded IA at the earliest feasible time post the blinded IA. This unblinded IA will be performed by [CONTACT_10981], unblinded statistician not involved in the conduct of the study. 
The complete details of this interim analysis is provided in the IASAP.  In the event the 
unblinded IA occurs, a partial unblinding of specified data and personnel will occur. The plan,

 Page 74 of 85 
 
Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  procedures, and methods for this unblinded interim analysis are detailed in the IASAP as well.  
Under the assumption that an unblinded IA will occur as planned, and assuming a non-binding 
futility boundary, the Type 1 error probability for the interim analysis is conservatively 
assumed to be α<0.0001; therefore, the Type 1 error probability for the final analysis is α=0.0499 (two- sided test).  
If the unblinded analysis is not performed the Type 1 error probability for the final analysis will remain at α=0.05 (two -sided test) .

Protocol Amendment 6.0/dated 07JAN2022 FINAL  ATTACHMENT 2: RADIATION ASSOCIATED WITH CT SCANS  
CT scans are required at Baseline and Week  24/ET to evaluate eligibility criteria and primary 
and secondary endpoints. All CT scans will be sent to a central imaging core lab for review and 
analysis.  
Radiation due to the CT scans required for this study is a risk to the subjects enrolled in this 
study. The expected dosing for each modality/view is shown below.

Thin -Slice CT  2.[ADDRESS_400423] that undergoes all study-required imaging is 
expected to be approximately 4 millisievert (mSv)  (American Nuclear Society ). Based on a large 
study of cancer risk associated with exposure to radiation, it was estimated that the excess relative risk for cancer is 0.97 per Sv ( Cardis et al, 2005). The excess relative risk of the 
radiation that each subject would receive from participation in this study is therefore 0.97/Sv * 4 mSv * 1 Sv/ 1000 mSv=0.0039. To help place the radiation risk estimate for this study into perspective, a person will be exposed to 0.[ADDRESS_400424] flight ( Radiologyinfo.org), and the public is exposed to approximately 3 - 6.2 
mSv / year from background radiation ( Huda et al, 2005 and United  States  Environmental 
Protection Agency).

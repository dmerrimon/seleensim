Page 7PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Indication
[COMPANY_007]’s investigational Clostridium difficile vaccine (PF -06425090) is a prophy lactic vaccine 
that is currentl y being investigated for the prevention of primary C difficile infection (CDI) in 
adults 50 y ears of age and older.
Objectives and Endpoints
Primary Immunogenicity Objective: Primary Immunogen icity Endpoint:
 To demonstrate that the immune responses induced by 
3 lots of C difficile vaccine are equivalent as measured 
by [CONTACT_233011] A – and toxin B– specific 
neutralizing antibody levels [ADDRESS_281049] 
vaccination when administered in a 3-dose regimen to 
healthy adults 65 to 85 years of age. C difficile toxin A – and toxin B– specific neutralizing 
antibody levels for each lot, expressed as geometric 
mean concentrations (GMCs) (neutralization 
units/mL) at Month 7.
Primary Safety Objectiv e: Primary Safety Endpoints:
 To evaluate the safety of C difficile vaccine when 
administered in a 3 -dose regimen to healthy adults 65 
to 85 years of age, as measured by [CONTACT_233012], adverse events, and serious adverse 
events. Local reactions (pain, erythema, and induration), as 
self-reported in electronic diaries (e -diaries) for up to 
[ADDRESS_281050] .
 Systemic events (fever, vomiting, headache, fat igue, 
new or worsening muscle pain, and new or 
worsening joint pain), as self -reported in e -diaries for 
up to [ADDRESS_281051] .
 Nonserious adverse events from signing of the 
informed consent document (ICD) to [ADDRESS_281052].
 Serious adverse events from signing of the ICD to 
[ADDRESS_281053] .
Study Design
This is a Phase 3, placebo- controlled, randomized, observer -blind ed study  to evaluate the lot 
consistency , safety , tolerability , and immunogenicity  of an aluminum hy droxide 
(AlOH) -containing C difficile vaccine (200 g total toxoid) administered as a 3-dose regimen 
at Months 0, 1, and 6 in healthy  adults 65 to 85 years of age.
Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 4 groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (L ot 1: Lot 2: L ot 3: 
placebo).
Investigational Products
Clostridium difficile Vaccine
The investigational C difficile vaccine is toxoid based. C difficile toxin A and toxin B are 
inactivated b y a combination of genetic mutations and chemical treatments. The vaccine is 
PF-06425090 ( Clostridium difficile Vaccine)
B5091008
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 8provided as a sterile ly ophilized powder in a dosage strength of 200 g/dose (total for 
toxoids A and B) given at Month 0, Month 1, and Month 6. The vaccine will be 
reconstituted with AlOH diluent immediately  before use as instructed in the investigational 
product (IP) manual. The AlOH diluent is supplied as a 1 -mg aluminum/mL (as AlOH) 
liquid suspension.
Placebo
The placebo will consist of a sterile normal saline solution for injection (0.9% sodium 
chloride injection, in a 0.5 -mL dose) and will be provided by  [CONTACT_161697].
Statistical Methods
The study  sample size estimate is based on the study  primary  immunogenicity  objective to 
demonstrate lot -to-lot consistency , by [CONTACT_233013] A – and toxin B–specific 
neutralizing antibod
y in terms of GMCs, [ADDRESS_281054] vaccination (Month 7). A 
2-fold equivalence margin is used as the criterion; 263 evaluable subjects per lot will provide 
an ov erall 90% power to declare equivalence between all 6 comparisons for both toxin A and 
toxin B.
Assuming a maximum study  nonevaluable rate of 20%, a total of 1316 subjects need to be 
enrolled in the study  to meet the primary  objective, with a randomization ratio of 1:1:1:1 
(Lot1: Lot 2: Lot 3: placebo).
The primary  immunogenicity  objective of the lot -to-lot consistency  will be achieved if the 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) on the GMC ratios for all 6 comparisons are within 
the interval (0.5, 2), for both toxin A and toxin B.
All safet y and reactogenicity endpoints will be summarized as proportions of subjects with 
events by  [CONTACT_29299].  Additionally , exact 2- sided 95% CIs for proportions will be 
provided as applicable.
For immunogenicity  endpoints , GMCs and geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) from 
baseline will be calculated by  [CONTACT_233014] 95% CI s for b
oth toxin A and 
toxin B.

1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
[COMPANY_007]’s investigational Clostridium difficile vaccine (PF -06425090) is a prophy lactic vaccine 
that is currentl y being investigated for the prevention of primary  C difficile infection (CDI) in 
adults 50 y ears of age and older.
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Clostridium difficile Disease Background
C difficile , a gram -positive anaerobic, spore -forming bacillus, is the main cause of 
nosocomial infectious diarrhea in industrialized countries.1,2,3,4,5  It accounts for 20% to 30% 
of cases of antibiotic
-associated diarrhea and is the most commonly  recognized cause of 
infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings.6  C difficile is carried in approximately  3%of 
healthy  adults and approximately  16% to 35% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39485]; among the latter the rate 
increases with exposure to antibiotics.7  As many  as 50% or more of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232987]  C difficile are asymptomatic carriers.6
C difficile can produce 3 toxins, toxin A (TcdA), toxin B (TcdB), and binary toxin.8  TcdA 
and TcdB are the principal virulence factors for CDI,9causing severe inflammation in the 
bowel.10
,11  The spectrum of CDI ranges from as ymptomatic colonization and mild 
self-limiting diarrhea, to more serious complications such as severe diarrhea, 
pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, and death.2,12
Indiv iduals with mild to moderate CDI may
 experience diarrhea 3 or more times a day  for 2 
or more day s, along with mild abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_232988].  However, individuals 
with a severe infection may  experience watery  diarrhea 10 to 15 times a day , abdomin al 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_232989], fever, blood or pus in the stool, nausea, dehy dration, 
loss of appetite, weight loss, swollen abdomen, kidney failure, and increased white blood cell 
count.13
The main ri sk factors for an initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_232990] , prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and severe comorbidities.  Older adults (>65 y ears of age) are at an increased 
risk for CDI, particularly when exposed to healthcare settings.11,14,15,16,[ADDRESS_281057] antibiotic treatment, 
approximately  15% to 35% of patients suffer from at least 1 recurrence.11
,18,19Additional 
risk factors for recurrence include failure to mount an immune response to TcdA and/or 
TcdB and infection with a hy pervirulent strain.20,[ADDRESS_281058] been reported.25,26  A systematic review published in 2012 
reported 30
-day mortality  estimates in Europe ranging from 6.8% to 42%.26  In a surveillance 
study  conducted in the Unite d States, approximately  453,000 cases of CDI and 
approximately  29,000 deaths were reported in 2011.27  Based on data reported from acute

Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_281059] of caring for patients experiencing CDI in the U nited States ranges 
from $1.1 to $4.[ADDRESS_281060] increased.27,28,30  Key factors in this escalation include emergence of 
hypervirulent pathogenic strains such as BI/NAP1/027,31,32,33increased use of antibiotics,34
improved detection methods, and increased exposure to spores in healthcare facilities.35
Metronidazole has been recommended as initial therapy  since the late 1990s
, but recent 
guidance issued b ytheInfectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends either 
vancom ycin or fidaxom icin as the first choice, and metronidazole should be used onl y if they 
are not available .6,21,36,[ADDRESS_281061] a correlation between high serum concentrations of antitoxin A and B

and protection from CDI or recurrence after primary  CDI.20,42,43,[ADDRESS_281062] 
shown that active immunization with inactivated toxins (“toxoids”) and passive 
immunization with antitoxin antibodies protec t animals from lethal challenge.45
,46,47  A 
Phase 2 trial with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) designed to neutralize TcdA a nd TcdB 
provides clinical evidence supporting a role for antitoxin antibodies in the prevention of CDI 
recurrences.[ADDRESS_281063] TcdB (bezlotoxumab) was administered, whether 
on its own or in combination with the mAb against TcdA (actoxumab), compared with 
placebo.[ADDRESS_281064] 
2 other vaccines in development that target C difficile toxins.  A toxoid- based vaccine 
adjuvanted with aluminum hy droxide (AlOH) has been evaluated in Phase 1 and 2 
studies,50,51,52,53and efficacy  is currently  being evaluated in a Phase 3 study .54  The other is a 
recombinant fusion protein comprising fragments of the receptor -binding domains of TcdA
and TcdB separated b y a 4–amino acid linker ;55this vaccine has been evaluated in a 
completed Phase 2study .56

Page 12The increasing burden of CDI  on patients and on the healthcare s ystem demonstrates that 
prevention of CDI constitutes a significant unmet medical need.
1.2.3. Clostridium difficile Vaccine Candidate
[COMPANY_007]’s C difficile vaccine candidate consists of a 1:1 mixture of C difficile toxoids A and B.  
The toxoids were derived from native toxins by  [CONTACT_233015] , and chemical inactivation prior to final purification and formulation o f the drug 
substance.
[IP_ADDRESS].
Nonclinical Development
In nonclinical experiments, [COMPANY_007]’s C difficile candidate vaccine was studied either alone or 
in combination with AlOH.  Using the standard hamster C difficile disease model, vaccine 
formulations with and with out AlOH demonstrated a survival benefit, providing at least 90% 
protection from a lethal challenge with C difficile spores in the immunized hamsters.  In 
addition, pooled sera obtained from hamsters immunized with the Cdifficile vaccine 
formulated with A lOH neutralized secreted toxins from C difficile isolates representing 
diverse ribot ypes/pulsed -field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) t ypes, including hypervirulent 
strains, and covering >67% and >70% of the circulating strains in the [LOCATION_002] and 
Europe, respectivel y. In nonhuman primates, [COMPANY_007]’s toxoid vaccine formulations with and 
without AlOH induced robust neutralizing antitoxin antibody  responses to both TcdA and 
TcdB.  The nonclinical data generated b y [COMPANY_007] in rhesus macaques support the use of a 
3-dose regimen of the C difficile vaccine, with or without AlOH.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Development
The B5091001 first -in-human study  was a placebo -controlled, randomized, observer -
blinded 
Phase 1 study  that evaluated the safet y, tolerability, and immunogenicit y of Pf izer’s 
Cdifficile vaccine.  Three (3) antigen dose levels (50, 100, and 200 g) were assessed and 
administered either alone or in combination with AlOH at Months 0, 1, and 6 to healthy  
adults 50 to 85 y ears of age.57  Overall, the C difficile vaccine formulations and dose levels 
administered were generally  well tolerated.  Local reactions and s ystemic events were 
predominantly  mild to moderate, were more common in the 50 -to 64 -year age cohort, and 
comprised mos
tly injection site pain, headache, and fatigue.  Adverse events (AEs) were 
reported in all vaccine groups, with little difference in the number of subjects between the 
dose groups and the placebo group or between vaccine formulations.  I n subjects who 
received the vaccine formulations, both the toxin A –and toxin B –specific neutralizing 
antibody  geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) increased substantially  at [ADDRESS_281065] that both the antitoxin A –and 
antitoxin B
-specific neutralizing responses were trending higher in the toxoid -only groups 
compared to the toxoid + AlOH groups.  Furthermore, the magnitude of the immune 
response was similar in the 2 age cohorts.
Based on these data, a Phase 2 study  (B5091003) was initiated using a 3 -dose regimen 
(Day s1, 8, and 30) and 2 antigen dose levels (100 and 200 g) of the toxoids alone

Page 13reconstituted with sodium chloride diluent.  However, recruitment and vaccinations were 
halted because of the occurrence of 7 cases of Grade 3 injection site redness after Dose 2.  In 
light of this observed tole rability  profile, the decision was made to progress development of 
the AlOH -containing formulation into a second Phase 2 study . This Phase 2 study  
(B5091009) of the AlOH -containing formulation is ongoing to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenic ity of 2 antigen dose levels (100 and 200 g) and two 3- dose regimens 
(Day s 1, 8, and 30 and Months 0, 1, and 6).  A prespecified interim analy sis of data up to 
Month [ADDRESS_281066] ered at Months 0, 1, and 6 was superior to that when the doses were administered at 
Days 1, 8, and 30. In addition, the 200- g dose level was more immunogenic than the 
100-g dose level. On this basis, it was decided to progress into Phase 3 development with 
the 200- g dose level administered at Months 0, 1, and 6.
The ongoing Phase 3 efficacy  study  (B5091007) is a placebo -controlled, randomized 
(1:1, vaccine:placebo), observer -blinded, parallel- group stud y in subjects [ADDRESS_281067] an increased risk of CDI.  In the absence of an accepted immunological 
correlate of protection for CDI, vaccine efficacy  (VE) will be determined by  [CONTACT_233016][INVESTIGATOR_232991].
The pre sent study  (B5091008) is a Phase 3, placebo -controlled, randomized, 
observer -blinded study  to evaluate the lot consistency , safet y, tolerability , and 
immunogenicit y of the C difficile vaccine 200- g dose level administered at Months 0, 1, and 
6 in healthy  adults 65 to 85 y ears of age.  The study  seeks to recruit a relatively  healthy  
population in an age category  that is harmonized with the previous Phase 2 study  
(B5091009). The Phase [ADDRESS_281068] licensure. Since commercial production of this vaccine will involve multiple 
manuf acturing campaigns and multiple lot productions, it is imperative to demonstrate that 
vaccination from different lots y ields similar responses within an acceptable margin.

4.4.1. Contraception
All fertile male subjects who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexually active and at risk 
for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use a highly  effective method o f 
contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the vaccination period and for at 
least [ADDRESS_281074] of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has 
been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the 
schedule ofactivities
, the investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use 
highl y effective contraception consistently  and correctl y and document the conversation and 
the subject’s affirmation in the subject’s chart (subjects need to affirm their consistent and 
correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).  In addition, the 
investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected 
contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is know n or suspected in the partner.
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal), provided the male 
subject’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire 
study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to 
ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD).
3.Male condom or female condom used WITH a separate spermicide product (ie, foam, gel, 
film, cream, or suppository ).  For countries where spermicide is not available or condom 
plus spermicide is not accepted as highl y effective contraception, this option is not 
appropriate.
4.Male sterilizati on with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy  ejaculate.
5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).

5.INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Council for Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an activ e 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an un approved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33).
For this study , the investigational products are C difficile vaccine and placebo (saline). Since 
the appearance of these investigational products is not ide ntical, the study  is 
observer -blinded.  The [ADDRESS_281075]
Allocation of subjects to vaccine groups will proceed through th e use of an interactive 
response technology  (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response [I WR]) in a 
randomization ratio of 1:1:1:1 to each of the lots and control group.  Study  personnel (either

Page 20blinded or unblinded) will be required to enter or select in formation including but not limited 
to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number.  
They  will then be provided with a randomization number, vaccine assignment, and 
dispensable unit (DU) or container number.  Th e IRT sy stem will provide a confirmation 
report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number 
assigned.  The confirmation report must be retained by  [CONTACT_233019].
The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_110275].
5.2.Blinding of Site Personnel
In this observer -blinded study , the study  staff dispensing and administering the vaccine will 
be unblinded, but all other site study  personnel, including the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_232995], will be blinded.
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_232996]/administrators to persons who will not participate in the evaluation of any  study 
subject.  To ensure adequate coverage, at least 2 unblinded dispensers/administrators will be 
assigned per site. Members of the study  site staff or clinic pharmacy  should fulfill these 
roles.  Contact [CONTACT_233020] a 
minimum.  The investigator, study  coordinator, and any  site staff other than the unblinded 
dispensers/administrators must not be allowed to know the investigational product assigned 
to any  study  subject and must not be allowed to see the investigational product container 
contents.
5.3.Blinding of the Sponsor
Those study  team members who are involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for 
investigational product handling, allocation, and administration are fulfilled at the site 
(eg,the unblinded [COMPANY_007] clinician [separate from the study  team], clinical research associates 
[CRAs]) will be unblinded for the duration of the study. All other study  team members and 
all laboratory  personnel performing the serology  assay s will remain blinded to vaccine 
assigned/received throughout the study .
5.4.Breaking the Blind
The study  will be subject and investigator blinded.
At the initiation of the study , the investigator site will be instructed on the method for 
breaking the blind.  The method will be an electronic process.  Blinding codes should be 
broken onl y in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual vaccine assignment 
is absolutely  essential for further management of the subject.  Investigators are encouraged to 
discuss with a member of the study  team if they  believe that unblinding is necessary .  When 
the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented and entered on the case 
report form (CRF).

Standard vaccination practices must be obser ved and vaccine must not be injected into blood 
vessels.  Appropriate medication and other supportive measures for management of an acute 
hypersensitivity  reaction should be available in accordance with local guidelines for standard 
immunization practices.
Administration of investigational products should be performed b y an appropriately 
qualified, Good Clinical Practice (GCP)-trained, and vaccine-experienced member of the 
study  staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, phy sician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, pharmac ist, or 
medical assistant) as allowed b y local, state, and institutional guidance.
Investigational product administration details will be recorded on the CRF.
5.7. Investigational Product Storage
The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, w ill ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational products should be stored in their original contai ners and in accordance with 
the labels.
See the IP manual for storage conditions of the product once reconstituted.
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions 
stated on the product label.
The investigational vacc ine, AlOH diluent, and placebo will be shipped at +2 C to +8C to 
each stud y site after required regulatory and legal documents have been received b y the 
sponsor. Upon receipt at the study  site, the products should be immediately  transferred to a 
+2C to +8C temperature -monitored refrigerator for storage.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, r efrigerated, and/or room -temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions s hould be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maxi mum 
temperature for all nonworking day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature -monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in workin g order.

Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipate d that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the subjec t.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.

7.1.Safety Assessments
Safety  parameters will be assessed as described in the schedule of activities , Section 6, 
Section 8, and below.
A clinical assessment, including medical history
, will be performed on all subjects at Visit [ADDRESS_281093] administration.  These prospectively  
collected occurrences of l ocal reactions and s ystemic events are graded as described in 
Section 7.1.1.

events reported on the e -diary  will be transferred electronically  to a third
-party  vendor, where 
they will be available for review by  [CONTACT_233028] -based portal. E- diary  data review is ongoing during subject e -diary  data -entry  
periods (from Day  1 to Day  7, with Day  1 being the day  of vaccination) via an internet- based 
portal.
At intervals agreed to b y the vendor and [COMPANY_007], these data will be transferred electronicall y 
into [COMPANY_007]'s database for anal ysis and reporting.  These data do not need to be reported by  [CONTACT_233029].
Investigators (or designee) will be required to review the e-di ary data online at frequent 
intervals as part of the ongoing safet y review.
The investigator or designee should obtain stop dates for an y ongoing local reactions or 
systemic events on the last day  that the e -diary  was completed.  The stop dates should be 
documented in the source documents and the information entered in the CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Grading Scales
The grading scales used in this study  to assess local reactions and sy
stemic events as 
described below are derived from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center f or 
Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) guidelines on toxicity  grading scales for health y 
adult volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials.58
[IP_ADDRESS]. Local Reactions
During the e -diary  reporting period, subjects will be asked to assess redness, swelling, and 
pain at the injection site and to record the s ymptoms in the e -diary .  If a local reaction 
persists beyond the end of the e -diary  period following vaccination, the subject will be 
requested to repo rt that information.  The investigator will enter this additional information in 
the CRF.
Redness and swelling will be measured and recorded in measuring device units (range: 1 to 
21) and then categorized during anal ysis as absent, mild, moderate, or sever e based on the 
grading scale in Table 1.  Measuring device units can be converted to centimeters according 
to the following formula: 1 measuring device unit = 0.[ADDRESS_281095] by

In order to record information on fever, a digital thermometer will be given to subjects with 
instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home.  Temperature will be collected in 
the e -diary  in the evening daily  during the e -diary reporting period.  It will also be collected 
at an y time during the e -diary  data collection periods that fever is suspected.  Fever is defined 
as an oral temperature of 38.0C (100.4F).  The highest temperature for each day will be 
recorded in the e -

Appr oximately  20 mL (minimum of 10 mL  and up to 20 mL) of blood will be collected to 
allow for adequate volume required for repeat testing or additional antigen -specific 
immunogenicit y testing to be performed.
Refer to the SRM for details regarding serum sampl e management and storage.
7.3.
Biological Samples
Serum samples will be used only  for scientific research.  Each sample will be labeled with a 
code so that the laboratory  personnel testing the samples will not know the subject’s identity . 
Samples that remain a fter performing assay s outlined in the protocol may  be stored by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Unless a time limitation is required b y local regulations or ethical requirements, the samples 
will be stored for up to 15 y ears after the end of the study  and then destroy ed.  If al lowed b y 
the ICD, stored samples may  be used for additional testing to better understand the immune 
responses to the vaccine(s) under stud y in this protocol, to inform the development of other 
products, and/or for vaccine -related assay  work supporting vacc ine programs.  No testing of 
the subject’s genetic material will be performed.
The subject may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroy ed at any  time; 
however, an y data already collected from those samples will still be used for t his research.  
The biological samples may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality  is 
maintained and no testing of the subject’s genetic material is performed.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Requirements
The table below summarizes the requireme nts for recording safet y events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety  events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; 
(2)nonserious AEs; and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study  during 
pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report

with an AE), except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding , 
occupational exposure (regardless of 
whether associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of vaccine group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragra phs.
PF-06425090 ( Clostridium difficile Vaccine)
B5091008
Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_281102] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the S erious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this wil l include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, mus t be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (e g, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y nonserious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology , and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 368.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study D ue to Adverse Events (s ee also the Subject 
Withdrawal section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.
When a subject withdraws from the stud y because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or rece iving investigational product), through and including 
Visit 5 (Month 7).
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject durin g the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS].
Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both nonserious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_47610] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is t he determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
PF-06425090 ( Clostridium difficile Vaccine)
B5091008
Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_281103] caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records.
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source document s and CRF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serio us adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of und erlying disease;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;

Page 38Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medi cation error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires addition al diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therapy ; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233003];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
PF-06425090 ( Clostridium difficile Vaccine)
B5091008
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 08 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 39Medical and s cientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Medical device complaints may  meet the SAE reporting requirement criteria (see the Medical 
Device Complaint Reporting Requirements sect ion).  An incident is an y malfunction (ie, the 
failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as intended; 
performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device) that, 
directly  or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a subject, or user, or of 
other persons, or to a serious deteriora tion in their state of health.
A serious injury  that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:
A life -threatening illness, even if temporary  in nature;
A permanent impairment of a bod y function or permanent damage to a body 
structure; 
A condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above 
2bulleted items;
Examples: clinically  relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure; a 
condition that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233004];
Any indirect harm as a consequence of an incorrect diagnostic or in vitro diagnostic 
device test results when used within the m anufacturer’s instructions for use;
Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality  or birth defects.
8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tubercu losis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril
y constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.

Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by [CONTACT_43038] y 
protocol);
Optional admission not asso ciated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol an d/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the defin ition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.

Page 418.3.Severity Assessment
GRADE If require d on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, or LIFE- THREATENING to describe the 
maximum intensity  of the AE. For purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades 
are defined as follows:
[ADDRESS_281104]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_281105]'s usual function.
[ADDRESS_281106]'s usual function.
4 LIFE -
THREATENINGLife-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicate d.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serio us unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_233032], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database.
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug -induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
Liver function tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in this 
study .  However, should an investigator deem it necessary  to assess LFTs because a subject 
presents with clinical signs/sy mptoms, such LFT results should be managed and followed as 
described below.
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TB ili typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same laboratory  
PF-06425090 ( Clostridium difficile Vaccine)

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 42sample).  In rare instances, by  [CONTACT_22858], AST/AL T values might 
have decreased.  T his occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions .  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values wit hin the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
oPreexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline v alues AND >3 
× ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
oPreexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should retur n to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_281107] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphat ase, and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time o f the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history ,

B5091008
Final Protocol Amendment 1, [ADDRESS_281108] with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to ch emicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevatio n defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of inve stigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an EDP occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490]
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or arou nd the time of conception and/or is exposed during 
his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subje ct 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the e xposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 44Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports w ith an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_233033] l inspection (unless 
preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, n eonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are r eported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_281109].
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth out comes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved f or use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication E rrors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Other examples include, but are not limited to:
The administration of expi[INVESTIGATOR_149325];
The administration of an incorrect investigational product;
The administration of an incorrect dosage;
The administration of investigational product that has undergone temperature 
excursion from the specified storage range, unless it is determine d by [CONTACT_233034].
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the e vent of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .

Medication errors should be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety within [ADDRESS_281110] led to 
death or serious deterioration in health, or if it occurred again might lead to death or serious 
deterioration in health.
[COMPANY_007] is to be notified of all medical device complaints within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
A detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal ysis of the data collected in this 
study  will be documented in a statistical analy sis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before 
the start of an y anal yses and will be maintained by  [CONTACT_456]. This document may  modify  
the plans outlined in the protocol; however, an y major modifications of the primary  endpoint 
definition and/or its analysis will be reflected both in the amended protocol and in the SAP. 
The SAP amendment will follow the protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
In order to meet the immunogenicity  primary  objective, the study  sample size esti mate is 
based upon the evaluation of lot -to-lot consistency on the toxin A– and toxin B–specific 
neutralizing antibod
y in terms of GMCs, [ADDRESS_281111] vaccination (Month 7). A 
2-fold equivalence margin is used for the stud y.Assuming the inhere nt difference for toxin 
A
–and toxin B –specific neutralizing antibod y responses is no more than 0.2 (in logarithmic 
scale) between an y 2lots, and the common standard devi ations for toxin A –and toxin 
B
-specific neutralizing antibodies are 0.899 and 1.485 (natural log value), respectivel y (based 
on the standard deviations for toxin A and toxin B at Month 7 in Study  B5091009), a sample 
size of 263 evaluable subjects per lot will provide an overall 90% power to declare 
equivalence between all 6 comparisons fo r both toxin A and toxin B (see Table 4).

9.2.Immunogenicity Analysis
The immunogenicit y data will be summarized ac cording to the vaccine group (active vaccine 
and placebo) as received in the evaluable immunogenicity  population, and according to the 
vaccine group as randomized in the modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population.  Subjects 
receiving vaccine who did not fo

the evaluable immunogenicity  population.
The C difficile toxin A –and toxin B –specific neutralizing antibody  levels at each blood 
sampling time point will be summarized by  [CONTACT_214331] (any  C difficile toxin A –or toxin 
B-specific neutralizing antibody  level that is below the lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ] 
will be assigned as 0.5 × LLOQ) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI s).  The 
GMC will be calculated as the mean of the assay  results after making the logarithm 
transformation and then back transformation to its original scale.  Two (2) -sided 95% CIs 
will be constructed b y back transformation of the CI  for the mean of the logarithmically

An evalu able immunogenicity  population and a mITT population will be defined for the 
immunogenicit y anal yses separately .  The evaluable immunogenicit y population will be the 
primary  population for the immunogenicit y analyses.
In general, the evaluable immunogenici ty population will include all subjects who are 
eligible, receive the investigational product to which they  are randomized, have blood drawn 
for assay  testing within the specified time frame, have valid and determinate assay  results for 
either toxin A or t oxin B for the proposed anal ysis, and have no major protocol deviations.

The E- DMC will review safet y data at defined intervals as specified i n the charter. The 
E-DMC may  conduct additional meetings to review safet y data at other time points during 
the study , at its discretion, or at the request of the sponsor. In addition, as determined by  [CONTACT_233035], the E -DMC may  meet on an ad hoc basis to evaluate any  SAEs related to 
vaccination, or related AEs that may  jeopardize further subject participation, in order to 
determine that the stud y may be continued safel y.
After each meeting, the E -DMC will make recommendations that may  include th e following: 
continue the study  with or without modification; or pause or stop vaccination for safety  or 
other reasons.
The recommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the study  will be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007] for final decision. [COMPANY_007] will for ward such decisions, which may  include 
summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, 
to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may  review source documents to 
confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The investigator and institution will 
allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  authorities direct 
access to source documents to perform this verification.  This verification may  also occur 
after stud y completion.
During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, the investigator site may be subject to 
review b y the institutional review board (IRB)/ ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality  
assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], 
and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_47615].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The i nvestigator will promptl y provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.

11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, w ithout written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that t hey are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contai ned on the CRFs are true.  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.
In some cases, the CRF may  also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that cle arly identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the 
investigator agrees to keep re cords, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
ICDs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of 
treatment d isposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, 
meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should be retained by [CONTACT_20471] I CH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specifi ed in 
the clinical study  agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuat ion of the study  or for longer if required by  [CONTACT_13762].

It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, ICDs, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if 
applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All correspondence with the I RB/EC should be retained in the 
investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immedi ate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study

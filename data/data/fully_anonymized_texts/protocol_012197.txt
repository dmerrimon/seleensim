INTRODUCTION 
 Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is a medical treatme nt used for neuroprotecti on in certain clinical 
scenarios where there is a s ubstantial risk of brain injury.  TH is thought to improve neurological outcome by 
[CONTACT_348692], reducing blood-brain  barrier disruption and attenuating free-radical 
mediated and excitatory neurotransmitter-mediated pathology.  TH during cardi ac surgery has been in 
routine use since the 1950’s and is  also considered a recommended treatment for adults who have 
experienced cardiac arrest according to both the American Heart Associ ation (AHA) and th e International 
Liaison Committee on Resuscit ation (ILCOR) guidelines.  Amongst adu lt cardiac arrest patients, there has 
been recent controversy regard ing whether hypothermia (cooling to 33°) or the avoidance of hyper thermia 
(aggressive maintenance of 36°) pr ovides superior neuroprotection.  A recent publication in the New 
England Journal of Medicine of [ADDRESS_433188] and us e of TH resulted in a “statistically  significant and clin ically important 
reduction in the combined outcome of mortality and ma jor neurodevelopmental disability to 18 months of 
age.”[ADDRESS_433189] will focus on the use of TH and th e management of rewarming after TH 
in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) follo wing congenital heart surgery.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_348654], developmental outcomes for the 40,[ADDRESS_433190] and for 72 hours in newborns with signs of intrapartu m asphyxia.  Both these patient 
populations are slowly “rewarmed” (b rought back to normothermia) over a period of 12 hours in a carefully 
controlled manner.  This strategy for slow rewarming was developed due to  the re-emergence of seizures, a 
clinical sign of brain irritabi lity and injury, in infants mo re rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348655] 6 hours13-15.   Patients who 
undergo cardiac surgery (adults, children and infants) however, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_348656] “rewarmed” to 
normothermia at a rate of 1°C each 3-5 minutes, due to concerns surrounding th e risks associated with 
prolonged time on the cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_348693], such as higher rates of  thrombus formation, 
embolic events or even hemorrhages.  For an infant  cooled to 18°C during surgery, it may take only 54 
minutes to rewarm to 36°C.    
There is emerging evidence that rapid temperature cha nges of this magnitude may be deleterious to the 
very neurons that TH is being employe d to protect.  Animal data suggest that such rapid rates of rewarming 
may diminish or even negate the neuroprotecti ve effect of hypotherm ia used during surgery16,17.  In human 
trials, adults and children have demo nstrated significant cognitive dete rioration if rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348657]18,19.  These studies have used a co mbination of serum biomarkers 
(s100b and Neuron Specific Enolase) that  are indicative of brai n injury and performa nce on cognitive testing 
as outcome variables.

populations, including adult patients with traumatic brain injury and stroke and neonates with hypoxic 
ischemic brain injury20.  S100b has also been studied in adu lts and children follo wing cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_6476]21-23 and found to be elevated with correlations es tablished between poorer neurological outcomes and 
elevated s100b levels.  Neuron specific enolase (NSE)[ADDRESS_433191] of 
care (rapid rewarming to normothermia in the opera ting room on by[CONTACT_6476]) versus a delayed rewarming 
technique (which stopped rewarming on by[CONTACT_348694] 33°C and permitted passive rewarming to normothermia 
over the next several hours)19.  The children in the delayed rewarm ing group had lower s100b levels in the 
postoperative setting compared to th e standard of care group.  In a ddition, the delayed rewarming group 
showed no post-operative deteriorati on in neuropsychological function comp ared to the standard of care 
group, which displayed post-operative deteriorat ion across all domains including information, 
comprehension, arithmetic, digit span and verbal IQ.  These findings in older children are compelling and 
suggest that similar investiga tion is needed in infants.  
In this proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the safety of delayed re warming will be assessed in infants under the age of 
[ADDRESS_433192] of care group.   
Successful completion of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_348658] a future adequately powered 
efficacy study to determine if the delayed rewarming technique leads to improved developmental outcomes. 
  
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate safety of  delayed rewarming in infants fo llowing congenital heart disease 
surgery through intensive care unit level monitoring  of parameters including hemodynamic status, 
coagulopathy, infection, hyperthermia and subcutaneous fat necrosis.  In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], infants under the age of [ADDRESS_433193] of care versus experimental group.  The experimental treatment is “delayed rewarming” and will be defined as the cessation of rewarming on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_348694] 35°C.  
There will be 12 hours of c ontrolled rewarming to 36.5 °C via the use of a programmable body temperature 
regulating blanket that is FDA approved for this us e.  Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_348695]-operative se tting in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for adverse effects on 
hemodynamic status (bradycardia, ju nctional ectopic tachycardia, hypo tension and need for additional 
medication to support heart rate or blood pressure),  for coagulopathy (lab evidence of disseminated 
intravascular coagula tion, chest tube output and need  for transfusion of blood pr oducts), infection (such as 
pneumonia), effects on other end organs (monitored via la b testing for kidney function daily), frequency of 
infants with hyper thermia and lastly close inspection of the skin to insure there is no evidence for 
subcutaneous fat necrosis. 
My hypothesis is that the “delayed rewa rming” group will not demonstrate a higher 
frequency or severity of adverse events compared to the standard of care group.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Compare early and late biomarkers for adverse developmental outcomes between standard of 
care and “delayed rewarming” groups including serum biomarkers of brain injury, electroencephalogram 
(EEG) and developmental outcomes.

show a trend toward lower levels of biomarkers of brain injury.  
2.[ADDRESS_433195] EEG and monitor seizure frequency in infants for 48 hours following CHD surgery. Seizures, if they 
occur, will be treated in both groups and the duration quan tified in seconds. EEG is needed primarily to rule out 
potential confounding effects of seizures on later developm ental outcome. It is hypothesized that there will be 
infrequent seizures and no differences in seizure frequency or duration between groups.  
2.3  Compare developmental outcomes using  Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Bayley 3). Bayley testing will 
be performed on infants at either 6 or 12 months of age depending on the infant’s age at the time of surgery. It is 
hypothesized that infants in the “delayed rewarming”  group will show a trend toward improved Bayley scores 
compared to the standard of care group. 
Preliminary data: 
A retrospective review of cases of congenital heart disease requiring su rgical palliation was 
performed for cases from January [ADDRESS_433196]. Reed Quinn’s 
office.  Please see the attached letter of support for this project from [CONTACT_32130].  In this review, there were 
[ADDRESS_433197]. Qu inn in the 41 month interval 
(average 4.6 surgeries per month).  Some infants requi red multiple surgeries and therefore the total number 
of surgeries (191) reflects [ADDRESS_433198] includes only infants 
undergoing cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) for the first time.  In this sample , there were [ADDRESS_433199] (1.9 infants per month or 22 per year).  Anticipating a 2 year period of recruitment, there 
should be approximately 44 eligible infants and we will seek to enroll 30.

recovered for [ADDRESS_433200] intraoperative temperature was 18 ° for [ADDRESS_433201] intraoperative temperature was 36 ° for 5 infants and the mean intraoperative temperature was 
30.1° .  The most frequently occurring intraopera tive temperature was in the range of 34-34.9 ° with 32 cases 
(48%) over the 41 month time period (see Figure 1).  A pplying inclusion criteria for the proposed study, 
58/66 (88%) would be eligible for Phase [ADDRESS_433202] intraoperative temperature of less than 
35° (red circle).  Extrapolating this to the whole nu mber of [ADDRESS_433203] likely been 67 
infants who would meet inclusion criteria (1.6 pe r month x 24 months recruitment period=39 possible 
recruits).  When considering the inclusion criteria for Phase 2, 22/66 (33%) infants from the retrospective 
cohort had a lowest intraoperative temp erature of less than 33.5° (yellow da shed circle).  Extrapolating this 
to the whole number of [ADDRESS_433204] likely been 25 infants who me t inclusion criteria (1.0 
per month x 24 months recruitmen t period=24 possible recruits).  
In a different retrospective review of congenital heart surgery cases under th e age of 6 months (2008-
2013), there is evidence of significant variability in pos t-operative temperatures on arrival to the Pediatric 
Intensive Care Unit (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) from the Operating Room (O R).  The mean arrival temperature was 36.6°C, with 
a range of 32.9°  to 39.2 °.  Eleven infants were significantly h ypothermic upon arrival to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_348659] 32.9°  to 35 ° (see Figure 2) and all but [ADDRESS_433205].   
 
In the same review from 2008-2013, fourteen infant s arrived to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_348660] 
38°C , with 2 of those over 39 °C and as such would be considered hyper thermic (see Figure 2).  Of the [ADDRESS_433206]-operative temperature management as it is well established in 
the traumatic brain injury and stroke literature that hyper thermia is associated with worse outcomes.  This 
preliminary data also suggests that by [CONTACT_348696] 36-36.5°C according to the current institutional protocol on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476], at least one third of infants then devel op “overshoot” of their temperature 
beyond 37°C.  This post-operative hyper thermia may also be corrected w ith use of the delayed rewarming 
strategy proposed in this project and as such is a potentially m odifiable source of neurological injury.

Subjects and study design:  30 infants under the age of 12 months with congenital heart disease requiring 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_348697].  The expe rimental treatment is “delayed 
rewarming” and will be defined as the cessation of rewarming on cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_348694] 35°C (see 
Figure 3).  During both phases, there will be  12 hours of controlled rewarming to 36.5 °C and the temperature 
will be maintained at 36.5 C for the 12 hours after rewarming  .  All types of congenital heart disease

enrollment.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_348662], giving the family time to come to terms with this new diagnosis.  At the first meeting with the PI, the family will be inform ed about the research study and given informational 
handouts.  Another meeting will occur prior to the admission during which the congenital heart surgery will be performed.  At this second meeting, informed c onsent documentation will be reviewed and signatures 
obtained from parents willing to part icipate.  For infants who need conge nital heart surgery within the first 
few days of life or for those in whom a fetal diagnos is was not made, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_348663].  The envelopes for randomization will be opened at the time 
consent is obtained to insure that there is adequate time to arrange for the type of post-operative care the 
infant will receive (interventi on versus standard of care). 
Standard of care group:  For infants assigned to the standard of care group, the congenital heart surgery will 
be performed according to usual practice with the de gree of intra-operative hypothermia determined by [CONTACT_348702].  Following completion 
of the surgical procedure, the in fant will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348664] a rate of 1°C 
each 3-5 minutes.  The infant will achieve normothermia of 36-37°C and be transported to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) for routine post-operative monitoring.  Standa rd of care procedure in the post-
operative setting is clearly defined below on Figure 4.   
 
Routine monitoring includes careful obs ervations of the following parameters: 
1. Hemodynamic status- The components of hemodynamic status that are conti nuously monitored in the 
postoperative setting include heart rate, rhythm and blood pres sure.  In the post-operative setting, 
telemetry (continuous heart rate mon itoring) is standard on all congenita l heart patients and all patients 
have arterial lines placed for continuous blood pre ssure monitoring.  These are direct measures of 
hemodynamic status and are continuously uploaded to the electronic medical  record on a minute to Figure 4: Standard  of Care Temperature  Management  afte r By[CONTACT_348703]   36‐37°C 1. Bair Hugger: consider 38°C setting rather than 43°C setting

altered and therefore blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels  will be assessed daily for the first 
48 hours after surgery (may be more frequently at the discretion of the team managing the patient).  
2. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219]- Most infants return to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_348670].  Ventilator support is  titrated by [CONTACT_348704][INVESTIGATOR_348671] e obtained at regular intervals 
depending on the acuity of the patient.  Chest x-rays are obtained daily to m onitor for pneumonia or the 
development of other fluid collections in the chest (i.e. chylous effusion). 
3. Coagulopathy-After congenital heart surgery, some infa nts have difficulty with coagulation (may occur 
in part as a result of the anticoagulation medications  that are used during by[CONTACT_348705]) and 
are subsequently at risk for bleed ing or clot formation.  Disseminat ed Intravascular Coagulopathy (DIC) 
is routinely screened for daily with laboratory studi es including fibrinogen, IN R, platelet count, PT/PTT 
and D-Dimer.  Infants may be treated with Platelets or Fresh Frozen Plas ma or Cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_348672]. Chest tube out put is also monitored in cc/kg   
4. Infection- The nurse and medical team will monitor fo r signs of infection including fever and appearance 
of the surgical wound.  Central line related infections and urinary catheter relate d infections are also 
monitored for and these lines ar e removed as soon as is feasib le to decrease this risk. 
5. Hyperthermia-Hyperthermia is undesirable in a post-opera tive congenital heart patient.  Nurses routinely 
follow temperatures at the same intervals detailed a bove for the other vital signs and will treat infants 
who develop hyperthermia with anti-fever medications. 
Three deviations from routine care will occu r in the standard of care group.   
1. Electroencephalogram (EEG) will be performed in th e immediate [ADDRESS_433209] loading dose of 
phenobarbital (20 mg/kg) followed by a second loading dose of phenobarbital in th e event of persistent 
seizure activity. In the unlikely scenario that se izures are still present, Fosphenytoin would be 
administered in a 20 mg/kg loading dose. The type  of medications admini stered including dose and 
timing of administration will be reco rded in the electronic medical reco rd and compared between groups.   
2. Residual blood that would otherwise be wasted from a clinically obtained samp le will be collected and 
used for testing for biomarkers of neuronal injury (s100b and NSE). These samples will be obtained at 
the following 5 intervals; the pre-operative setting for baseline, post-operatively after by[CONTACT_6476], at post-op 
hour 24, at post-op hour [ADDRESS_433210]. Anne Breggia, Re search Program Director of the 
BioBank and Research Laboratory Serv ices (RLS) at Maine Medical Cent er Research Institute has kindly 
agreed to assist with technical  support for the processing of th e s100b and NSE testing.  The s100b 
testing is a serum ELISA test run on a kit provided by [CONTACT_36455]™.  This test requires 100µL of serum 
per sample to be tested.  This ELISA may be run on a sample that has been previously frozen.  The NSE test is also run on serum and is an ELISA test re quiring 100µL of serum that may also be used on a 
frozen stored specimen. The company providing the NSE sample kit is R&D Systems.  The stored 
samples will then be run in batches once the full co llection period is complete.  The collection of the 
samples and the handling of samples will be facilitated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_348673], research

Neuroscience Service Line who is funding the research coordinator position). 
3. Bayley Infant Scales of Development (Bayley 3) w ill be performed between age 9 months and 2 years. 
The testing will be performed by a physical therapis t who assesses fine and gross motor indices and by a 
Master’s level psychologist who assess both th e cognitive and language development components. 
Severe developmental disability will be defined as a Bayley Mental Developmen t Index score that is [ADDRESS_433211] deviations below the mean score (eg. below 70)5. Moderate developmenta l disability will be 
defined as a Bayley Mental Developm ent Index score that is [ADDRESS_433212] deviations below the mean 
score (eg. below 70-84)5. The parents of research subjects will have the opportunity to meet with a 
member of the developmental assessment team to review results of the testing.  
Experimental group:  For infants assigned to the experimental  group, the congenital heart surgery will be 
performed according to usual practice  as detailed in the standard of care group section above, with depth of 
hypothermia dictated by [CONTACT_348706] l heart lesion to be repa ired.  Upon completion of 
the surgical procedure, partial rewarming will occur on cardiopulmona ry by[CONTACT_6476], but will stop when the 
infant reaches 35°C.  
The infant will be transported from the operating room to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_348674] 35°C and placed on a servo-controlled 
blanket with an esophageal temperature probe placed.  Th rough use of the servo-cont rolled blanket, the rate 
of rewarming will be carefully regula ted with increases in temperature of 0.3°C every 2 hours for 6 and then 
of 0.2°C every 2 hours for 6 hours to the goal temper ature of 36.5°C (see Appendix 1 for temperature 
management worksheet phase 1). The intensity and fr equency of post-operative monitoring will be exactly 
the same in the experimental group as in standa rd of care group, includi ng post-operative EEG, serum 
biomarker testing and neurodevelopmental follow up.  The following parameters will be observed in the experimental group and compared w ith the standard of care group.  
1. Hemodynamic status-Infants who are hypothermic typi[INVESTIGATOR_348675] (80-100 beats per minute versus  120-140 beats per minute respectively).  In the 
post-operative congenital heart infant , bradycardia (slow heart rate) co uld conceivably have an adverse 
impact on the hemodynamic status of the infant and if untreated this could also impact renal function.  
Hemodynamic status will be continuously monitored in the same manner as detailed in the standard of 
care section.  Intravenou s medications to support cardiac functi on and blood pressure (which these 
infants are typi[INVESTIGATOR_348676] d with) will be up-titrated if necessary. The need for permanent 
pacemaker implantation will be documented.    Normothermic or hyperthermic post-operative c ongenital heart infants may experience a cardiac 
arrhythmia following surgery known as junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET).  JET is a surgical complication that is concerning due to the fact that the newly repaired he art is beating significantly faster 
than it is intended to, adding si gnificant strain to the heart mu scle and potentially compromising 
hemodynamic stability.  One of the treatments for JET is to reverse hypert hermia (this is only an option 
if the patient has a fever) or potentially even use hypo thermia for refractory cases.  We will monitor 
carefully to determine whether or not  there is a decreased incidence of  JET in the experimental group.   
2. Coagulopathy- In adults who under go therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest, there is evidence 
of coagulation dysfunction and subseque nt risk of bleeding.  This tends to not be the case in infants who 
tolerate therapeutic hypothermia better than adults.  Laboratory screening for coagulopathy will occur as 
described in the standard of care group and if coagulopathy develops, blood products (Pla telets or Fresh 
Frozen Plasma or Cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]) will be administered  to reverse this.  Chest tube output will also be 
carefully monitored in cc/kg/hour and the number of days  a chest tube is in place will also be recorded . 
3. Infection- In adults, there is evidence for increa sed rate of ventilator acq uired pneumonia in patients 
undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after myocardial infarction.  Again, this is unusual in infants who 
Ver. 7 Date 08/31/2017  
 
9 | Page tolerate hypothermia better.  The infants in this study will receive daily chest x- rays in the post-operative 
setting and signs of infection will  be carefully monitored for and an tibiotics started if necessary.  
4. Hyperthermia-The infant’s temperatur e will be closely monitored during rewarming and for [ADDRESS_433213] this complication.  It is expected that the short dur ation of rewarming (only 12 hours) 
will not cause any incidents of subcutaneous fat necrosis.   
Anticipated outcomes: The primary outcome variable is safety of the delayed rewarming technique which 
will be determined by [CONTACT_348707].  Specifically, clinically signi ficant changes in the hemodynamic status of the infant, coagulopathy, 
infection or the presence of subcutaneous fat necrosis will be evaluated (see Table 1 for full definitions of all 
parameters).  The secondary outcomes include the comparison of serum biomarkers (s100b and NSE), EEG 
findings including seizure frequency a nd developmental outcome assessments in the standard of care versus 
delayed rewarming group.  It is antici pated that the delayed rewarming tec hnique will be safe and that a trend 
will be seen toward lower level of s100b and NSE in the delayed re warming groups, although this study is 
not powered to definitively assess this. Given that this project is considered more than “minimal risk”, a data 
safety monitoring plan has been developed (see attached DSMB plan). The DSMB will determine whether or 
not an adverse event is clin ically significant and whether or not it is  attributable to the delayed rewarming 
intervention.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_348677] m onitoring entity with [ADDRESS_433214] 12 months who su rvived congenital heart surg ery with cardiopulmonary 
by[CONTACT_348708].  Of the 15 infants, the mean age at th e time of surgery was 148 days  with a range from 4 to 
356.  Of the 15 infants, 10 were male and 5 female.  These infants had a mix of cardiac lesions similar to 
those who would be enrolled in this study.  See Tabl e 1 for a full outline of parameters that will be 
considered acceptable for infants enrolled in the study, which are based on the retrospective review of 15 
survivors. Using these parameters to define what has been previously consistent  with “safe”, any infant 
enrolled in the proposed study with results outside these parameters will then be considered as an adverse 
event and the data safety m onitoring board will be informed.  If a seve re adverse event occurs in either Phase 
1 or Phase 2 of the proposed research protocol, no addi tional infants will be enro lled and all experimental 
exposures will be suspended until a decision is made by [CONTACT_4318].

Regarding management of patients with complications from the delayed rewarming intervention, the most 
likely complication from the delayed rewarming inte rvention is bradycardia dur ing the [ADDRESS_433215]-operative temperature starts  at 35°C, the bradycardia is  likely to be minor.  If 
bradycardia develops, providers at  the bedside will assess the hemodyna mic status of the infant.  A 
determination will be made regarding whether or not the bradycardia is resulting in any degree of 
hemodynamic compromise.  Hemodynamic compromise will be defined by [CONTACT_348709], poor renal function or oliguria.   If there is hemodynamic compromise, then pressors will be titrated to increase the heart rate and blood pres sure.  These infants are typi[INVESTIGATOR_348678]-operative setting.   Rapid rewarmi ng may be considered if in creasing pressors does not 
resolve the issue.  In other populatio ns of infants, however, rapid rewa rming has been found to increase the 
severity of adverse events.  Specifically, in term newborns with pe ripheral pulmonary hypertension, rapid 
rewarming exacerbates their condition by [CONTACT_348710] (to the large vascular 
bed in the skin that was just rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348679]).  For this reason, rapid rewarming would only be used as a second step if pressor titr ation was not successful.   
ANALYSIS 
Data will be collected at the bedside and through ch art review.  A study ID number will be assigned 
to each infant and study documents will all use this ID  number to combine data.  Identifiable data will be 
stored separately.  Preoperative (baseline) variables including gender, age in months and type of congenital 
heart lesion will be collected.  A ba seline s100b and NSE will also be cons idered pre-operative variables. 
Intraoperative variables including aortic cross clamp time, cardiopulmona ry by[CONTACT_95187], lowest temperature 
during surgery, time for rewarming on by[CONTACT_348711] 3 groups and s100b and NSE at the completion of 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_348712].  Postoperativ e variables include temper ature, heart rate, blood

intubation, coagulation dysfunction, frequency and t ype of infection and presence or absence of 
subcutaneous fat necrosis for [ADDRESS_433216]-operative time points as well.   
Success of randomization will be assessed by [CONTACT_348713]; we acknowledge that randomizati on may not be entirely effective w ith such a small sample size and 
we will examine the data for biases to be considered  in interpreting our findings .  For this safety study, 
primary outcomes will be composite outcomes and will include the frequency of serious adverse events as well as the frequency of any adverse events (see Ta ble 1) and will be compared among treatment groups 
using chi square tests or Fisher’s ex act tests, as appropriate.   The fre quency of individual adverse events 
such as hemodynamic compromise, a rrhythmia, coagulopathy, infection, hyper thermia and subcutaneous fat 
necrosis will also be examined.  Biomarkers (s100b a nd NSE) will be examined using a repeated measures 
analysis of variance, with th e time * treatment interaction serving as the hypothesis test. 
Additional project support: This clinical project will take place at  Maine Medical Center in the Pediatric 
Intensive Care Unit.  I have the s upport of [CONTACT_348729], pediatric ca rdiothoracic surgeon, Robert Groom, 
chief perfusionist, [CONTACT_348730], pediatric anesthesiology , [CONTACT_348731], pediatric cardiology,

attached documentations of department al support.  I also have the suppor t of the Pediatri c Intensive Care 
Unit nurses and respi[INVESTIGATOR_348680]-operative care fo r these infants.  The equipment 
needed for implementing the delayed rewarming techni que was purchased by [CONTACT_348714].  The disposable cooling blankets that the infants will be placed upon as well as the 
disposable temperature probes were purchased from the KL2 grant.   
 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
Maine Medical Center (MMC) is committed to protect th e rights and welfare of all research subjects. We 
received accreditation for our human research protection program (AAHRPP) in 2011. All investigators who 
are engaged in research are required to submit their research to our Institutiona l Review Board for review 
prior to conducting their research. We  also provide a program for conti nued oversight and monitoring of all 
projects.  Human Subject Protection a nd Health Information Privacy and S ecurity training through CITI is a 
mandatory component of training for all personnel invol ved in this study as part of the Human Research 
Protection Program (HRPP) policy at Maine Medical Center.  This resear ch proposal, including recruitment 
materials and the informed consent will be submitted to  the IRB for review and approval. This study will be 
performed in accordance with [ADDRESS_433217] to regulation by a fede ral department or agency. 
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics and Design:   The goal of this research is improve 
developmental outcomes in infants who have under gone congenital heart surgery. Infants who require 
surgical correction of conge nital heart defects are often treated w ith hypothermia during the surgery to 
protect the brain.  Following completion of congenital hear t surgery, the current standa rd of care is to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348681].  This rapid rewarming is thought to have adverse effects on the brain.  This project pr oposes to partially rewarm infants to 35°C on by[CONTACT_348715] [ADDRESS_433218], safety of the

12 | Page “delayed rewarming” technique will be assessed and we will ultimately aim to assess efficacy in a larger 
future trial if safety can be shown first.    
The study of human subjects is therefore necessary to ach ieve the goals presented in this application. The 
proposed clinical research for specific aims [ADDRESS_433219] the racial homogeneity 
of the state of Maine. 
Infants will be randomized to one of  two groups; the standard of care gr oup versus the experimental group.  
Infants in the experimental group wi ll receive the delayed rewarming therapy, which consists of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_348682] 35 °C and gradual rewarming over [ADDRESS_433220] be demonstrated.  Animal models would be 
inadequate both due to an inability to recreate surgical heart lesions in rodents or other mammals and due to the inability to fully translate animal de velopmental outcomes into human outcomes. 
Sources of Materials:  For this protocol, the frequency of adve rse events will be compared between the 
standard of care group and the expe rimental group across 5 specific ar eas as follows: hemodynamic status, 
coagulopathy, infection, hyperthe rmia and subcutaneous fat necrosis (see  next section for full details).  The 
current standard of care for intensive care unit monitori ng is adequate to monitor for adverse events in both 
the standard of care and experimental groups.  Adverse ev ents will be clinically apparent and both the event 
and medical management will be documented in the infant’s medical record.  Continuous vital signs 
(temperature, heart rate, blood pre ssure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_14367]) will be monitored and 
recorded by [CONTACT_348716] -operative laboratory and 
imaging studies.  These will include laboratory tests fo r evidence of renal dysfunction, coagulation studies 
and chest x-rays monitoring for infection and fluid accumulation.  The equipment used to provide delayed 
rewarming to the [ADDRESS_433221] info rmation described above, HIPAA standa rds will be adhered to and data 
that is kept will be de-identified. Each participan t will be assigned an individual participant number and 
names and medical records will not be used.  All paper documentation will be kept in a secure file in a locked area and will ultimately be scanned to pdf a nd stored on a secure and encrypted server.  When

Research Coordinator, Deb Cushing, RN will be the onl y persons with access to the key which encodes the 
subject name [CONTACT_348723].   
Potential Risks:   There are potential risks to  the critically ill subjects enrolled in this study, the most 
significant of which are outlined below: 
6. Hemodynamic status-Infants who are hypothermic typi[INVESTIGATOR_348675] (80-100 beats per minute and 120- 140 beats per minute resp ectively).  In the post-
operative congenital heart infant, bradycardia (slow h eart rate) could conceivably have an adverse impact 
on the hemodynamic status of the infant and if untr eated this could also im pact kidney function.  
Hemodynamic status will be monitored and intravenous medications to support cardiac function and 
blood pressure (which these infants ar e typi[INVESTIGATOR_348683]) will be up-t itrated if necessary.  
  Normothermic post-operative congenital heart in fants may experience a car diac arrhythmia following 
surgery known as junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET).  JET is a surgic al complication that is concerning 
due to the fact that the newly repaired heart is bea ting significantly faster than  it is intended to, adding 
significant strain to the heart muscle and potentially compromi sing hemodynamic stability.  One of the 
treatments for JET is to reverse hypert hermia (this is only an option if the patient has a fever) or 
potentially even use hypo thermia for refractory cases.  We will monitor carefully to determine whether 
or not there is a decreased incidence of JET in the delayed rewarming group.   
7. Coagulopathy- In adults who under go therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest, there is evidence 
of coagulation dysfunction and subseque nt risk of bleeding.  This tends to not be the case in infants who 
tolerate therapeutic hypothermia better than adults .  Laboratory screening fo r coagulopathy will occur 
and if coagulopathy develops, blood products (Platelets or Fresh Frozen  Plasma or Cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]) will 
be administered to reverse this.  
8. Infection- In adults, there is evidence for increa sed rate of ventilator acq uired pneumonia in patients 
undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after myocardial infarction.  Again, this is unusual in infants who 
tolerate hypothermia better.  The infants in this study will receive daily chest x- rays in the post-operative 
setting and signs of infection will  be carefully monitored for and an tibiotics started if necessary.  
9. Hyperthermia-The infant’s temperature will be closely monitored throug h use of a rectal temperature 
probe during the delayed rewarming pro cess.  A rectal probe must be us ed due to the fact that a skin 
recording is less ac curate with hypothermic patients.   
10. Subcutaneous fat necrosis-In infant s who are exposed to a full [ADDRESS_433222] this complication.  It is expected that the short dur ation of rewarming (only 12 hours) 
will not cause any incidents of subcutaneous fat necrosis.   
The alternatives to the proposed delayed rewarming trea tment are to continue to offer only the standard of 
care treatment of rapid rewarming on by[CONTACT_6476].  This st andard of care of rapid re warming is suspected of 
having a 
contribution to the cognitive  deficits and neurolog ical dysfunction experienced by [CONTACT_348717].  Given that it is known that newborn infants with 
hypoxic ischemic brain injury have esse ntially no adverse events related to  hypothermia, it is reasonable to 
try this delayed rewarming approach to see if it will be  safe in infants following congenital heart surgery.  
There is a research publica tion on children ages 6-[ADDRESS_433223] 
that this delayed rewarming techniqu e has been shown already to be safe and effective in an older population 
Ver. 7 Date 08/31/2017  
 
14 | Page of children in the post-operative setting with congenita l heart disease also makes it reasonable to test this 
technique in younger children.  
The privacy risk to participating subj ects is deemed to be minimal and cer tainly not in excess of that risk 
incurred with receiving medical care in the first place. 
ADEQUACY OF PROTECTI ON AGAINST RISKS: 
Recruitment plan and consent procedure: The pediatric cardiology team a nd pediatric cardiothoracic 
surgeon will refer appropriate patients to the principal investigator (PI) for consideration of enrollment.  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_348684].  For infant s born who need congenital heart surgery within the 
first few days of life, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_348685].  The envelopes 
for randomization will be opened at the time consent is ob tained to insure that th ere is adequate time to 
arrange for the type of post-operative care the infant will receive (intervention versus standard of care). 
Before infants are accepted into the study, the parent or guardian must: 
 give oral and written consent 
 be aware of alternativ e treatments, and that alternativ e clinical care is available; 
 be aware of the right to withdraw 
 
In a private location, following discussions about inform ed consent with the paren t/guardian, we will ask the 
parent or guardian to sign an au thorization to participate in research and permission to use or release 
protected health information (informe d consent).  Parents of potential pa rticipants who do not comprehend or 
speak the English language will be offered a personal translator through Maine Me dical Center’s (MMC’s) 
language bank.  The inclusion criteria specify that all participants w ill be both male and female infants under the age of [ADDRESS_433224] Risks:  The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at  Maine Medical Center will oversee the 
safety of subjects in this research study.  Initial approval is  required before the study is initiated and during 
its conduct.  Risk for adverse effects of the delayed rewarming stra tegy will be monitored by a drug safety and monitoring 
plan (see below).  Adverse events will be reporte d to the members of the monitoring board and the 
interpretation of these events being related to the delayed rewarming intervention will be made by [CONTACT_348718].  
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research :  There are significant potential be nefits to the subjects in this 
research.  Current practice for post-operative pediatri c congenital heart patients at Maine Medical Center 
includes rapid rewarming, which is thought to cont ribute to cognitive dysfunction and neurological 
abnormalities.  The delayed rewarming technique proposes to ameliorate this effect although this study in not 
powered to demonstrate this.  In addition, infants may not experience an arrhythmia (junctional ectopic 
tachycardia) as a result of better te mperature regulation that prevents hyper thermia and may have better 
cardiac performance as a result of th is. If infants have seizures, these will be better rec ognized and treated

developmental assessment could lead to earlier referral for therapy which may help outcome.  
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained:   Cognitive and developmental outcomes for infants following 
congenital heart surgery are suboptimal  in many cases.  The proposed dela yed rewarming strategy uses an 
FDA approved device for an approved indication in a new population of patie nts.  If the delayed rewarming 
strategy is safe and well-tolerated, s ubsequent studies will be designed to  assess efficacy.  We believe that 
this research is greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of di rect benefit to the individual child 
and to the population of infants with congenital hear t defects (according to 45 CFR 46.405).  It is also 
conceivable that the delayed rewarmi ng strategy could be implemented in children and adults in similar post-
operative settings.   
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan:  Three independent medical monitors have been appointed for this study 
to review clinical events in real  time to allow timely, unbiased deci sion-making regarding study risk.  The 
data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will consis t of [CONTACT_348731], attending pediatric 
cardiologist, [CONTACT_348734], attending pediatri c neurologist and [CONTACT_348735], attending 
pediatric intensive care physician.  N one of these three physicians were directly involved in the design or 
implementation of this research study and are therefore as unbiased as one can be in the assessment of safety.  
They have been selected to serve on the DSMB due to  their combined experience and ability to critically 
assess clinical scenarios.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_348686] [ADDRESS_433226] the ability to report adverse events as well.  The Data Safety 
Monitoring plan will follow the procedures and policie s outlined by [CONTACT_348719] (MMC).  This plan requires th at the study be reviewed by [CONTACT_348720] (IRB), and upon approval the conduct of the study will adhere to the Good 
Clinical Practice Standard Operatin g Procedures for Good Clinical Pract ice in the Conduct of Clinical 
Research at MMC.  A Study Coordinator from the MMC  Clinical Trials unit will be monitoring on a 
continuous basis the collection of study data for this research project.  The Study Coordinator will maintain 
all regulatory files and ensure that  all data collection is monitored against source documentation. The Study 
Coordinator will also ensure proper m onitoring for adverse events as well as protocol deviations, following 
guidelines contained in the Clinical Practice Standard Operating Procedures for Good Clinical Practice in the 
Conduct of Clinical Research at MMC.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_900500] is to employ 
novel technologies and develop new the rapeutic strategies to prevent  intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_667048] (i.e. actinic keratosis,  cutaneous  squamous cell carcinoma in situ ). 
Our objectives in pursuit of this goal are to determine clinical, histopatho logic, and 
protein/phosphopr otein signaling  patterns associated  with human skin carcinogenesis 
and to develop safe, highly efficacious  intervention strategies for the prevention of s kin 
cancer.  T he overall hypothesis  of the project is that Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and 
T-LAK cell -originated protein kinase (TOPK) / p53 -related protein  kinase (PRPK) drive 
important signaling pathw ays, with potential synergism to prevent cutaneous  squamous 
cell carcinoma  (cSCC ), and  that TOPK/RPRK and TLR4 signaling pathway s are 
modulated in the skin by [CONTACT_667063] (SSL ).  
 The aim of this study is to assess TLR4 and TOPK/P RPK signaling in sun 
damaged ( SD) human skin acutely  exposed to solar simulated light (SSL). The purpose 
of this aim  is to assess the effect of acute UV exposure on the  signaling  pathways of 
interest in order to validate the acute clinical model prior  to intervention with small 
molecule inhibitors. Acute UV  exposure will be  evaluated in SD skin to determine the 
level of  activation  of the targeted pathways using reverse -phase protein array ( LCM -
RPPA) analysis and immunohistochemistry ( IHC). This  translational aim will 
prospectively analyze TLR4 and TOPK/PRPK  signaling pathways activation by [CONTACT_667064] (MED) for each 
subject. We will  evaluate the modulation of key proposed signaling pathways using  
RPPA and IHC in acutely irradiated human skin. We w ill also d etermine the optimal time 
points  for evaluation of biomarker mo dulation.   
 Primary Endpoint:  To assess TLR4 and TOPK signaling pathway activation 
levels pre - and post -SSL exposure in SD skin.  
 Exploratory Endpoint:  To assess the correlation betwe en SD level and the 
magnitude of SSL -induced pathway activ ation .  
 Thirty -six (36) subjects with a broad range of SD on the forearm will be recruited. 
Based on the standardized clinical photodamage scale [1], we will include mild (N=12), 
moderate (N=12), a nd severely (N=12) sun damaged (SD) skin. The level of SD will be 
scored, using a range of 0 -9, where absent SD = 0, mild SD = 1 -3, moderate SD = 4 -6 
and severe SD = 7 -9 (see Appendix C).

common malignancy worldwide.  Approximately 4. 9 million cases of non -melanoma skin 
cancer (NMSC) (basal cell carcinoma [ BCC] and cutaneous squamous cell cancers 
[cSCC]) occur annually . As incidence rates for NMSC continue to rise, there is an  
increasing and substantial impact on morbidity and health care costs that account for 
$8.1 billion/year in skin  cancer treatment with  the majority of these lesions representing 
keratinocytic neoplasms.  
 New technologies increasingly allow for the capacity to individualize therapeutic 
prevention strategies based on gene expression patterns and direct, multiplexed cell 
signaling  profiling .  Target modulations, pathway activation, skin biology alterations, and 
other basic science discoveries will be translated into the clinic.  Increasingly, our 
research group has attempted to dissect solar light -induced signal transduction 
pathways leading  to cSCC with the aim of identifying molecular targets for 
chemopreventive drug development.  Essential to this research approach is a 
requirement to validate molecular targets identified in solar light -induced cSCC 
carcinogenesis and skin biology models.  Strategies to be employed inc lude 
incorporation of advanced R everse-Phase Protein A rray (RPP A) technology for analysis 
of p rotein/phosphoprotein activity  and molecular network analysis, and u se of 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis  from formalin -fixed pa raffin -embedded tissues.  
These technologies will allow us to detect unique targets for the ultimate individualized 
treatment of IENs in the skin.  
2.1 UV Signal Transduction Pathways  
 Ultraviolet radiation (UVR), the major etiologic factor in human skin c ancer, elicits 
a number of biological responses in the skin that include pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], erythema, and 
cell death [2-5]. UVR can be divided by [CONTACT_667065] (180 -280 nm), UVB (280 -
320 nm), and UVA regions (UVA I, 340 -400 nm; UVA II, 320 - 340 nm), all o f which show 
strong carcinogenic activity with regard to induction  of squamous type tumors in  mouse

 skin. UVR is a complete carcinogen in that it acts as both an initiator, presumably by 
[CONTACT_667066], and as a tumor promoter . Because 
UVC is absorbed by [CONTACT_667067], UVA and UVB are considered to be the major 
carcinogenic components of solar radiation with relevance for human skin cancer [6-13]. 
UVA comprises more than 95% of solar UVR and is recognized as a major contribut or to 
carcinogenesis [14-17]. Mechanistically, UVR induces both genotoxic effects such as 
DNA damage and mutations as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_667049]. DNA damage is induced directly by [CONTACT_667068]  (CPD) , (6-4) pyrimidine dimers, cytosine 
photohydrates and purine photoproducts that can yield specific “signature” mutations (C 
to T and CC to TT) [18,19 ]. Longer wavelengths can indirectly induce DNA single -strand 
breaks and DNA -protein crosslinks through reactive oxygen species [15]. Therapeutic 
prevention agents that demonstrate activity toward these UVR signaling pathways will be 
evaluated in clinical trials.

arachadonic acid/cyclooxygenase pathways, polyamine synthesis) .  This has been  
demonstrated by [CONTACT_667069], alpha -2-(Difluoromethyl) -dl-ornithine , or DFMO  [20,21 ]. 
 In a previous study completed by [CONTACT_404976], I HC was performed on samples 
collected at baseline, 5 min, and 1, 5, and 24 h following 2X MED of SSL on SP skin of 
10 subjects; there was a significant increase in pTOPK and pPRPK activity starting as 
early as [ADDRESS_900503] SSL exposure with a sustained expression up to 24 h ( Fig. 1). 
Analysis of TLR4 using the same samples also revea led increased pathway activation 
primarily at [ADDRESS_900504] -SLL exposure .   
 IHC assays will include pTLR4, MyD88, p -p65/NFkB, TAB2, pTOPK, p -PRPK, p -
Erk, pP38, and pP90RSK . IHC assays previously established will also be performed for 
validation of SSL -induced  changes.

2.3  Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] P rotein Signaling Networks  
 Reverse -phase protein array analysis  (RPP A), a novel analysis for multiplexed 
quantitative measurement of multiple signaling proteins from biological specimens  
represents a novel means of measurement of hundreds of proteins, many o f which are 
phosphoproteins , in a single biopsy specimen.  This array technology is a miniaturized 
calibrated dot -blot immun oassay, and with over 90 peer -reviewed publications 
supporting the implementation of this platform (60 from the Petricoin/Liotta lab oratories), 
it represents one of the most widely published protein microarray technologies.  
Moreover, the RPP A platform is now being used within the Petricoin laboratories for 
clinical trial -based applications since it is run as a CAP/CLIA in -house develo ped assay, 
which demonstrates the maturity of the platform.  With the RPP A technology, serial 
dilutions are printed of each sample, control or standard, to maintain sample

 concentration.  Each spot contains a bait zone measuring only a few hundred microns in 
diameter.  The detection probe can be tagged and signal amplified independently from 
the immobilized analyte protein.  Coupling the detection antibody with highly sensitive 
amplification systems can yield detection sensitivities to fewer than 1,000 to 5 ,000 
molecules per spot with good linearity (correlation coefficient or R2 = 0.990 -0.999) and 
inter-experiment precision (R2= 0.973).  Between run and within run analytical precision 
is between a 3-13% CV (coefficient of variation)  [22]. 
Activation of prot eins by  [CONTACT_667070] -driven signaling networks 
contains information regarding the disease process as well as potential therapeutic 
targets  [23].  The phosphorylation state of proteins can be detected and assessed using 
specific phospho -specifi c antibodies developed to recognize the phosphorylated isoform 
of the kinase substrates  [23-25].  Each antibody undergoes extensive validat ion for 
specificity prior to RPP A analysis using peptide competition and single band detection 
on Western as well as ligand induction.  Currently, [CONTACT_667094] has over 300 extensively 
validated different cell signaling antibodies in his portfol io.  Using RPP A, many  dozens of 
kinase substrates can be quantified and measured simultaneously through multiplexed 
phosphospec ific antibody analyses .  RPPA has demonstrated sensitivity, precision and 
accuracy that enable  the evaluation of signaling networks from  a very small number of 
cells (e.g. procured using laser capture microdissection) from biopsy material .    
3.0 EQUIPMENT  INFORMATION  
3.1 Solar Simulated Light Source  
 A Multip ort UV Solar Simulator Model 600  (Solar Light Co ., Inc., Philadelphia, 
PA) will be used to administer SSL exposure s to the test areas on the skin. The device is 
equipped with six 8mm  liquid light guide s (LLG) , allowing for 6 simultaneously conducted 
exposures .  A large 3x2 endplate places the LLGs several centimeters apart and is 
specifically designed for SPF and photopatch testing .  The dose of emission from each 
LLG can be precisely regulated and the spectrum of emission can be limited to UVA 
(320-390 nm) or UVB +UVA (290 -390 nm) .  For added safety,  the device is equipped 
with a power supply which stabilizes the lamp current .  An operator -controlled  shutter 
and dose control system monitor and control th e delivered dose.   
 An automatic internal igniter minimizes the electromagnetic interference and a 
fan provides cooling that increases lamp life.  The connection to the power supply is a [ADDRESS_900506]

  Tissue sections at 3 -5 microns will be cut, followed by [CONTACT_667078].  All tissue sections will be subjected to antigen retrieval using a citrate buffer 
in a Decloaking Chamber Pro (Biocare, Walnut C reek, CA).  Immunohistochemical 
staining will be performed using a Universal Alkaline Phosphatase RED biotin -free, 
multimer -based detection system or a streptavidin -biotin peroxidase system with a DAB 
chromagen and a hematoxylin counterst ain (Ventana Medic al Systems, Tucson, AZ) on 
an automated BenchMark® XT immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) 
or by [CONTACT_667079] (Vector Laboratories, 
Burlingame, CA) depending on the primary antibody species a nd an alkaline 
phosphatase substrate for detection.  In the case where mouse tissue will be stained 
with mouse primary antibodies, the Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M.™ Vector Laboratories, 
Burlingame, CA) will be used.   Positive controls will be included in each IH C assay and 
negati ve controls will include the omission of the primary antibody with replacement by a 
normal serum from the same species as primary antibody.  Biopsies will be batched for 
all analyses.  
Tissue sections will be measured using ImagePro Plus (Media Cybernetics , Silver 
Springs, MD) software systems and a Leica DMR microscope (Westzlar, [LOCATION_013]), and 
a Sony 3CCD color video camera (Japan).  The percent positive nuclear or cytoplasmic 
area per 40X field w ill be  determined for each biopsy.  A posi tive control slide  for each 
IHC assay will be included  when samples undergo image analysis to assess the daily 
variability of image analysis.  Ten percent of samples will be repeated to assure assay 
reproducibility in a blinded manner as determined by [CONTACT_667080].  
7.4    Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] P rotein Signaling Networks  
 Reverse -Phase Protein A rray Construction:  RPPAs will be constructed generally 
as described previously  (Section 2.3) .  Briefly, lysates will be loaded into 384 -well plates 
and serially diluted in lysis buffer for a  two-point dilutio n curve (neat and 1/4).   The RPP A 
technology has been developed and optimized for performance as a fluorescent -based 
calibrated assay, generally identical in design and analysis to standard ELISA or 
standard clinical imm unoassays. As a ca librated assay, each assay consists of:  
   a. Experimental patient samples printed in triplicate two -spot dilutions (neat and 1:4)  
   b. High, medium, and low controls printed in triplicate two -spot dilutions (neat and 1:4)  
   c. A calibr ator, consisting o f a [ADDRESS_900526]

  Image Analysis:  The current iteration of the RPPA uses a fluorometric image 
capture processing sys tem (NovaRay, Alph a Innotech) for image acquisition.  The 
system measures the sample’s fluorescence intensity value, subtracts the background, 
normalizes the result to the total protein, and extrapolates the value to the non -
parametrically fit calibration curve to generate a final intensity value.  The median of the 
triplicate values will be reported. Sypro -stained slides will be analyzed with MicroVigene 
image analysis software, version 2.200 (Vigenetech, North Billerica, MA) and Microsoft 
Excel 2000 softw are.  Images will be imported into Microvigene, which performed spot 
finding, local background subtraction, replicate averaging, and total protein normalization 
to produce a single value for each sample at each endpoint.     
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1   Sample Size Determination  
 We will examine the TLR4 and TOPK signaling pathways in acute SSL -exposed 
SD human skin. Subjects with evidence of SD will be enrolled (N=36); with 85% 
expected to complete the study (30 evaluable subjects). Primary analysis  will compare 
levels of RPPA analytes in each pathway  as stated above in baseline unexposed 
samples vs. samples collected 1 or 24 h after SSL in SD skin . The power is 93% or 
above when the correlation between the log [ADDRESS_900527] ranges from 0 to 0.4, and the power is 82% if the correlation is 0.6.   
Exploratory analyses will associate the SD score/severity level with analyte activation in 
the SD samples.  Based on these analyses, the mo st appropriate post -SSL time point 
(per pathway) will be selected based on the combination with the largest effect sizes.  
Furthermore, an exploratory systems biology analysis will be conducted  based on these 
analyses, o ne post -SSL time p oint (per pathway)  will be selected for future studies  
based on the combination with the largest effect sizes.  Furthermore, an exploratory 
systems biology analysis will be conducted .

 and the protocol will be re -evaluated to determine if the SSL doses should be adjusted 
or the trial should be stopped.  Assuming that the response rate for any marker is as low 
as 50%, there is only a one in 32 (i.e., approxim ately 0.03) probab ility of seeing five non -
responders, based on the binomial distribution, in a p articular marker.  The prospect of 
failing to see response in any of the markers, assuming that two or more are actually 
valid, is vanishingly small.  Thus, ch oosing a sample si ze of five for initial assessment 
runs very little risk of committing a false negative error.  This initial process will not 
assess succes s, and no inferential statistical analyses  will be conducted.  Only the 
presence or absence of expre ssion will be note d.

12.1 Evaluation for Adverse E vents  
The safety of all participants enrolled in this study will be monitored throughout the 
study. At baseline a study events form will be completed. Study personnel will review 
study events with the study participant at each visit.  Any reportable adverse experience 
(i.e., greater than baseline level), whether considered study related or not, will be 
recorded in an study events report form, along with the dates of onset, resolution, 
severity and remed ial measures taken.  In all cases, study participants will be followed 
until resolution of the event.  In  addition, patients will be instructed to notify the study 
staff by [CONTACT_667082], if neces sary, be 
evaluated  by [CONTACT_667083].  
12.2 Adverse Event (AE) D efinitions  
The following definitions of terms guided by [CONTACT_667084]:  
• Adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
study procedures.  
• Serious adverse event  is any adverse event that is fatal or life -threatening, is 
permanently disabling, requires or prolon gs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  is a congenital 
anomaly, is a nonmelanoma skin can cer on the test area but not at more distant 
sites, or overdose.  
• Life-threatening , for the purpose of reporting adver se events, refers to  an event in 
which the patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate  risk of death 
at the time of the event as it occurred (i.e., it does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more serious form, might have cau sed death).  
• Associat ed with the  study procedures  means that there is a reasonable 
possibility that the experience (event) may have been caused by [CONTACT_583338].  
• Unexpected adverse experience  (event) means any adverse experience (event) 
that is incon sistent with the pro cedures described in this protocol.

of any fatal, life -threatening and/or serious adverse events, regardless of cause, on a 
timely basis and m ust be apprised of all adverse events by [CONTACT_667085] a periodic 
and timely basis, at least annually.  
A written report of all serious adverse events and deaths will be submitted by [CONTACT_24657]/EC .  In this report, t he Investigator will  advise whether or not the 
adverse event is judged to be related to the study procedures. All such patients with 
adverse events should be followed clinically and by [CONTACT_667086].  
All adverse events, regardless of severity, and whe ther or not ascribed to the study 
procedures  will be recorded in the appropriate section of the Case Report Form.  The 
Investigator will follow patients withdrawn from the study due to adverse events until the 
outcome is determined and,  when appropriate, a dditional written reports and 
documentation will be provided.

12.6 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_667087], and according to the following guidelines:  
 NO, NOT RELATED:  This category is applicable to those adverse events that 
are clearly due to extraneous causes (concurrent drugs, environment , etc.) and d o not 
meet the criteria for study procedure  relationship listed under PROBABLY NOT; 
POSSIBLY; PROBABLY; AND YES, RELATED.  
 PROBABLY NOT RELATED:  This category applies to those adverse events 
that are judged to be unlikely to be related to the  study procedures.   An adverse event 
may be considered to be PROBABLY NOT RELATED when it meets at least two (2) of 
the following criteria:  
a)  It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
procedures.  
b)  It could read ily have been produc ed by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
c)  It does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the study procedures.  
d)  It does not reappear or worsen when the stud y procedures are  re-administered.  
 POSSIBLY RELATED:  This category applies to those adverse events that are 
judged to be perhaps related to the study procedures.   An adverse event may be 
considered POSSIBLY RELATED when it meets at lea st one (1) of the fo llowing criteria:

procedures.  
b)  It could not readily h ave been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state,  toxic or 
environmental,  or other modes of ther apy administered to the subject.  
c)  It follows a known or expected response pattern to the study procedures.  
 PROBABLY RELATED:  This category applies to those adverse events that are 
felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the study procedures.   An adverse 
event m ay be considered PROBABLY RELATED if it meets at least two (2) of the 
following criteria:  
a) It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
procedures.  
b)  It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_667088]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patients.  
c)  It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in study procedures.   There are 
exceptions when an adverse event  does not disappear upon discontinuation of the 
procedures, yet a relationship clearly exists.  
d)  It follows a known or expected response pattern to the study procedures.  
 YES, RELATED:  This category applies to those adverse events that are 
incontrovert ibly related to stud y procedures.   An adverse event may be assigned to this 
category if it meets at least the first three  (3) of the following criteria:  
a)  It follows reasonable temporal sequence from a dministration of the study procedures.  
b) It could no t be reasonably expl ained by [CONTACT_667089]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy.  
c)  It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in study procedures.   There are 
exceptions when an adverse event does n ot disappear upon discontinuation o f the 
procedures, yet a relationship  clearly exists  
d)  It follows a known or expected response pattern to the study procedures.

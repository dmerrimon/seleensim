Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  1.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS AND RESEARCH SUMMARY  
 
1.1 Protocol Synopsis   
 
This is a single arm phase 2 study to investigate the activity of osimertinib in patients with stage 
4 non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) mutation 
exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S7681, or exon 21 L861Q. Patients will be epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment naïve.   The study will use RECIST 
1.1 for assessment of efficacy and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) 
version 4.03. 
1 
 
Primary Objective:  Objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by [CONTACT_168860] 1.1  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1. Progression free survival (PFS) using RECIST as assessed by [CONTACT_093]  
2. Safety  
3. Overall survival (OS)  
      Exploratory objectives:   
1. Estimate the response rate and PFS in the specific mutation subsets of exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S7681, exon 21 L861Q or compound mutations  
 
Hypotheses:  Osimertinib has demonstrated activity in patients with EGFR exon [ADDRESS_196936] -line therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. erlotinib, 
gefitinib, or afatinib) is the standard first- line therapy.2-5  EGFR  exon 19 deletion and exon 21 
L858R mutations are the majority of EGFR  mutations.6,7  The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval for epi[INVESTIGATOR_168835]. In addition to these exquisitely sensitive mutations, there are other EGFR mutations identified present in 4% of NSCLC with adenocarcinoma. Several of the less common 
  
[ADDRESS_196937] demonstrated sensitivity to EGFR TKI such as exon 18 G719A, G719C, 
and G719S (approximatel y 6% of EGFR mutations), exon 20 S768I (approximately 1.5% of 
EGFR mutations) and exon 21  L861Q (approximately 3% of EGFR mutations).[ADDRESS_196938] 
demonstrated activity in patients with uncommon EGFR mutations (defined as exon 18 G719X, 
exon 20 S768I, or exon 21 L861Q) but the ORR and PFS are lower. A subset analysis of phase 3 
trials demonstrated activity of afatinib demonstrated activity, but 40% of patient required dose reduction related EGFR -associated adverse events.
9,[ADDRESS_196939] the resistance T790M resistance mutation, and less EGFR associated adverse events since there is relative sparing of the EGFR wild -type receptor. The FDA 
approved dose of osimertinib is 80 mg daily.  
 
This single arm study will investigate the activity of osimertinib in patients with EGFR exon 18 
G719X, exon 20 S768I, or exon 21 L861Q mutations to determine if it has sufficient activity and an acceptable safety pro file for further investigation.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
2.1          Disease Background   
 
The rate of epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGFR) mutations in non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
with adenocarcinoma histology is approximately 15%.6,[ADDRESS_196940] -line therapy with a  EGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib) is the standard of care. The current 
FDA approval for t hese three agents is specifically for these activating mutations. EGFR TKI 
activity in EGFR  mutant NSCLC with these activating mutations is due to the increased binding 
of the TKI compared to the binding of ATP leading to inhibition of the EGFR pathway and upregulation of pro-apoptotic pathway.
19 
 In addition to these exquisitely sensitive mutations, there are other EGFR mutations identified present in 4% of NSCLC with adenocarcinoma.
[ADDRESS_196941] 
demonstrated sensitivity to EGFR TKI such as exon 18 G719A, G719C, and G719S (approximately 6% of EGFR mutations), exon 20 S768I (approximately 1.5% of EGFR mutations) and exon 21 L861Q (approximately 3% of EGFR muta tions).
[ADDRESS_196942] generation reversible EGFR TKIs rarely exceed 55%.8  Patients 
with uncommon EGFR mutations were enrolled in two phase 3 trials of afatinib, an irreversible 
EGFR TKI, compared to platinum -based chemotherapy.4,5  In a retrospective analysis of the two 
phase 3 trials, afatinib is associated with a response rate of greater 55%, especially in NSCLC EGFR mutations G719X, L861Q, and S768I.
4,5,9  However, the subset of patients with G719X, 
L861Q and S768I EGFR mutations were 18 patients, 16 patients, and 8 patients, respectively. This study reveals activity of EGFR TKI’s in patients with these mutations. However, approximately 40% of patients treated with afatinib [ADDRESS_196943]-hoc analysis of the patients assigned to afatinib in two phase 3 trials did not 
reveal a difference in progression -free survival (PFS) between patients who underwent dose 
reduction in the first 6 months and those who did not.21 However, patients with uncommon 
mutations represent a small subset of patients (approximately 10% of patients, n=52), and efficacy data are not available from this subset.  
 
The fundamental problems with assessment of EGFR TKI activity in this uncommon mutation 
subtypes has been that most of the data are retrospective and consisted of small subsets.22 The 
definition of “uncommon” mutation has varied from study to study which further complicates the assessment of the effic acy. There is concern that the first generation EGFR TKIs (gefitinib, 
erlotinib) do not achieve the necessary inhibitory concentration, and afatinib has issues with tolerability and the frequent need for dose reduction. Collectively these mutations represe nt a 
significant proportion the EGFR mutant patient population.  
Current therapy  
 
The current standard first -line therapy is a platinum doublet for patients with stage 4 disease and 
uncommon EGFR mutations. Platinum and pemetrexed has an objective respons e rate (ORR) of 
approximately 30% and a median PFS [ADDRESS_196944] second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168836]. A response rate of 
approximately 5- 10% and median PFS of approximately 3 months are observed with docetaxel, 
and with immunotherapy a response rate of 20% is observed in the inten t-to-treat patient 
population. The response rate is estimated to be lower in the EGFR  mutant patient population.13-
15,[ADDRESS_196945] -generation inhibitors, osimertinib (AZD9291, 
TAGRISSO) is a potent irreversible inhibitor of both the single EGFR mutant (TKI -sensitivity -
conferrin g mutations) and dual EGFR mutant/T790M (TKI resistance -conferring mutation) 
forms of EGFR. As a result, osimertinib has the potential to provide clinical benefit to patients with advanced NSCLC harboring both the single sensitivity mutations and the T790M  resistance 
mutation following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI.   In vitro  studies have shown osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrisso) to be a potent and selective 
irreversible inhibitor of isolated wild -type and mutant EGFRs (IC50s <10 nm). Cell line EGFR 
phosphorylation assays demonstrated potent inhibition of single -activated (EGFR mutant) and 
double- T790M mutant (EGFR mutant/T790M) assays, with much weaker inhibition towards 
wild-type EGFR. In vitro  washout and time -dependent cellular kinetic studies demonstrated an 
irreversible mechanism of action of osimertinib. Oral treatment of mice bearing EGFR mutant and EGFR mutant/T790M exograft tumors leads to profound tumor growth regression. In 
contrast, higher doses of osimertinib were required to achieve significant t umor growth 
inhibition in wild -type EGFR xenograft models. Xenograft growth regression with osimertinib 
was accompanied by [CONTACT_2715]- and time -dependent pharmacodynamic inhibition of phospho- EGFR 
and the key downstream biomarkers phospho- AKt and phospho- ERK acro ss mutant and wild -
type EGFR disease models in vivo . Furthermore, chronic longer term oral treatment with 
osimertinib led to complete and sustained macroscopic disappearance of an EGFR mutant xenograft tumor. In support of this hypothesis, the EGFR  mutant cell line showed greater time to 
resistance in response to the osimertinib treatment in vitro  compared to earlier generation EGFR 
inhibitors. The active metabolites of AZD9291, AZD5104 and AZ7550, showed similar pharmacological  selectivity and activity pro files to parent, although AZ5104 showed a smaller 
margin of selectivity against wild -type EGFR in vitro.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_196946] ivity in 
biochemical enzyme assays and across NSCLC cell lines harbouring clinically relevant EGFR mutations (T790M, L858R and exon 19 deletion), with lower activity against wild- type EGFR. 
Moreover, osimertinib has caused profound tumour regression across  representative mutant 
EGFR xenograft and transgenic disease models in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations, which was accompanied by [CONTACT_168861].  
  
[ADDRESS_196947] provided strong support that 
osimertinib is more potent towards mutant EGFR compared with wild -type EGFR.  
 
Osimertinib has two active metabolites, AZ5104 and AZ7550. The geometric mean exposure area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of each metabolite (AZ5104 and AZ7550) was approximately 10% of the exposure of osimertinib at steady- state. AZ7550 
displays near identical pharmacology properties in vitro to osimertinib. In contrast, AZ5104 has greater potency against mutant and wild- type EGF R in vitro than osimertinib, which suggests 
this metabolite may have a smaller selectivity margin compared with mutant EGFR than osimertinib.  
 Osimertinib is a highly selective inhibitor of mutant EGFR, showing minimal off -target kinase 
activity when tested in a broad biochemical kinome panel, only showing significant potency against 18 other kinases (including ACK1, BLK, ErbB2, ErbB4, BRK, MLK1, MNK2), although the clinical significance of this biochemical activity remains unclear.  
 
Osimertinib, AZ510 4 and AZ7550 inhibited the hERG-encoded potassium channel with IC50 
values of 0.69 μM, 17.48 μM and >33 μM, respectively.  
 
There were no notable effects on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], visual, central nervous or cardiovascular systems in safety pharmacology studies. R eductions in gastric emptying and small intestinal 
transit were observed in rats.  
 
Pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in animals  
 
Osimertinib is a moderately permeable compound in Caco -2 cells and has good absorption 
properties in rats and dogs. Osimerti nib plasma protein binding is high (>94%) across mouse, rat, 
dog, monkey and in human plasma (94.7%). [14C]Osimertinib related material was shown to distribute to all tissues in a rat quantitative whole -body autoradiography (QWBA) study and 
there was also evidence that [11C]osimertinib and its active metabolite [11C]AZ5104 penetrated the blood- brain barrier (BBB) in a cynomolgus monkey PET study. In mouse, rat, dog and 
human hepatocytes, osimertinib metabolism was primarily to hydroxylated and dealkylated products with conjugation to a range of glutathione, cysteineglycine, glucuronide and sulphate conjugates with all human metabolites also produced by [CONTACT_168862].  The major route of osimertinib excretion in rats and dogs was via the feces with only minor elimination observed in urine. In vitro data supports CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_196948] of clinical drug- drug interaction (DDI) studies with itraconazole (strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor) and rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] (strong CYP3A4 inducer). In vitro, osimertinib showed potential to inhibit intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and CYP3A4 that led to the 
conduct of clinical DDI studies with rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) and simvastatin (CYP3A4 
substrate).  
  
[ADDRESS_196949] -implantation loss. Osimertinib had 
marked adverse effects on embryonic survival plus early postnatal viability and growth when administered to pregnant or lactating rats. Osimertinib has shown no genotoxic or phototoxic potential. The integrated non- clinical safety data supports the continued clinical development of 
osimertinib in the patient populations studied in the ongoing clinical studies.  
Clinical data  
At the data cut -off d ate (DCO) of [ADDRESS_196950] been exposed to study 
treatment (osimertinib alone, osimertinib in combination with another treatment, or comparator) 
in [COMPANY_008]- sponsored clinical studies. Of these, [ADDRESS_196951] been exposed to osimertinib (osimertinib alone [2080] or osimertinib in combination with another treatment [179]) in the ongoing osimertinib [COMPANY_008] -sponsored 
clinical program, and an additional [ADDRESS_196952] been characterized in healthy subjects and 
NSCLC patients. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, osimertinib apparent plasma clearance is 14.2 L/h, apparent volume of distribution is 997 L and terminal half -life is 
approximately 48 hours. The area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) and 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) of osimertinib increased dose proportionally over 20 mg to 240 mg dose range (i.e, 0.25 to 3 times the recommended dosage) after oral administration and exhibited linear pharmacokinetics (PK). Administration of osimertinib orally once d aily resulted 
in approximately 3 -fold accumulation with steady state exposures achieved after15 days of 
dosing. At steady state, the Cmax to Cmin (minimal concentration) ratio was 1.6-fold. 
The median time to Cmax of osimertinib was 6 hours (range 3 to 24 hours). The absolute 
bioavailability of TAGRISSO is 70% (90% CI 67, 73). Neither food nor gastric pH affects the exposure of osimertinib.

Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  In vitro, plasma protein binding of osimertinib is 94.7% (5.3% free). Osimertinib has also been 
demonstrated to bind covalently to rat and human plasma proteins, human serum albumin and rat and human hepatocytes. 
In vitro studies indicate that osimertinib is metabolized predominantly by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5. Two 
pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) have been ident ified in the plasma 
after oral administration. The geometric mean exposure (AUC) of each metabolite (AZ5104 and AZ7550) was approximately 10% of the exposure of osimertinib at steady -state.  
Osimertinib is primarily eliminated in the feces (67.8%) and to a lesser extent in the urine 
(14.2%).  Unchanged osimertinib accounted for approximately 2% of the elimination.  
Based on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP 3A4/5 but not CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In vitro, osimertinib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and does not inhibit P -gp, 
OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Based on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a substrate of P -glycoprotein and BCRP, 
but is unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions  
Based on clinical DDI studies, interactions with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are unlikely but 
strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the exposure of osimertini b. Osimertinib may also 
increase the exposure of co -administered BCRP substrates. Clinical PK interactions with co -
administered CYP3A4 substrates are unlikely. 
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib were observed based  
on age, sex, ethnicity, body weight, smoking status, mild or moderate or severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance [CLcr] >15 mL/min by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault) or mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment (mild: total bilirubin less than or equal to the upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] greater than ULN or total bilirubin between [ADDRESS_196954]; moderate: total bilirubin between 1.[ADDRESS_196955]). As 
patients with CLcr less than 15 mL/min, patients on dialysis, or patients with severe hepatic 
dysfunction were not included in the clinical trials, the appropriate dose of osimertinib has not been established in these patients.  
Based on an analysis of dose -exposure response relationships over the dose range of  20 mg (0.25 
times the recommended dose) to 240 mg (3 times the recommended dose), no apparent relationship between osimertinib exposure and objective response rate, duration of response and progression- free survival was identified. Over the same dose rang e, increased exposure led to 
increased probability of adverse reactions, specifically rash, diarrhea  and interstitial lung disease 
(ILD). A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis in AURA2 suggested a concentration -
dependent QTc interval prolongation of 14 msec (upper bound of two- sided 90% confidence 
interval [CI]: 16 msec) at a dose of 80 mg orally (PO). 
  
[ADDRESS_196956] of severe renal impairment on osimertinib PK is 
planned. In Study 11 (14C -ADME) osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550 were shown to undergo 
negligible renal clearance; however, as renal impairment can adversely affect some pathways of 
hepatic / gut m etabolism, the impact of renal impairment was assessed in the population PK 
analysis.  
In the population PK analysis, there was no impact of creatinine clearance on the PK of 
osimertinib (N=1086, median (min- max) baseline creatinine clearance of 82 [20.5 to 196] 
mL/min). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 471 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min), 208 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <60 mL/min), 5 patients  with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to <30 mL/min) and 402 
patients with normal renal function (≥90 mL/min), osimertinib apparent clearance (and exposure) were similar. Osimertinib can be administered to patients with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment (CLcr ≥15 mL/min) without any dose adju stments. Caution should be exercised 
when treating patients with end stage renal impairment (CLcr <15 mL/min) 
Hepatic impairment  
In Study 11, osimertinib was shown to undergo significant metabolism mediated clearance 
presumably with the liver as a major si te of biotransformation and hence, hepatic impairment 
might be expected to lead to increased exposure of osimertinib 
A clinical study investigating the impact of mild and moderate hepatic impairment (as assessed 
by [CONTACT_2751]- Pugh criteria) on osimertinib pharm acokinetics is ongoing (Study 08). In AURA Phase 
I, AURA extension and AURA2 patients were excluded if they had: 
• ALT >2.[ADDRESS_196957] if no demonstrable liver metastases or >[ADDRESS_196958] in the presence of liver metastases  
• AST >2.[ADDRESS_196959] if no demonstrabl e liver metastases or >[ADDRESS_196960] in the 
presence of liver metastases  
• Total bilirubin >1.[ADDRESS_196961] if no liver metastases or >[ADDRESS_196962] in the presence of 
documented Gilbert’s Syndrome (unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia) or liver metastases 
No clinical  studies have been conducted to specifically evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment 
on the pharmacokinetics of osimertinib. Population PK analysis of 104 patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN or total bilirubin between  1.[ADDRESS_196963]), 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.[ADDRESS_196964]) and 972 patients with normal hepatic function (total 
bilirubin ≤ULN and AST ≤ULN), osimertinib apparent clearan ce (and exposures) were similar. 
Hence, no dose adjustment is necessary for mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Due to no patients with severe hepatic dysfunction being evaluated in the clinical trials, dose recommendation is not available for subjects wi th severely impaired hepatic function. 
Food 
The impact of food on the bioavailability of osimertinib was evaluated in NSCLC patients in a 
definitive study (Study 09) at the 80 mg dose with the film -coated tablet (the proposed 
commercial formulation).  The geometric least square (LS) mean ratios comparing fed to fasted treatments for osimertinib Cmax  and AUC0 –72  were 92.75% (81.40, 105.68) and 106.05% 
(94.82, 118.60), respectively and were contained within the predefined equivalence limits of 70% to 143%.  Administration of the tablet with a high- fat meal did not affect median 
osimertinib tmax when compared with fasted conditions. 
An exploratory earlier assessment of the impact of food was also conducted in healthy volunteers 
in Study 05 (Part B) at [ADDRESS_196965] study and used a fixed- sequence, 2 -
period design, point estimates and 90% CIs of the ratios comparing fed to fasted treatments for osimertinib Cmax and AUC were also contained within the limits of 70% to 143. 
Based on the results from the definitive food effect study (Study 09) and supporting results from the exploratory study (Study 05, Part B) it is recommended that osimertinib can be  taken with or 
without food.  
 
Clinical efficacy  
First -line locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patient population  
In first- line (treatment- naïve) NSCLC patients, a total of 60 patients received PO treatment with 
osimertinib in the AURA Phase I study (30 patients each at 80 mg and 160 mg respectively). The 
overall ORR was 77% (95% CI: 64, 87) and the overall disease control rate (DCR) was 98% (95% CI: 89, 100). The median PFS was 19.3 months, with maximum duration of response (DoR) at 22.1 months. The percentage of patients remaining progression- free at 12 months was 
72% (95% CI: 59, 82) and at 18 months 55% (95% CI: 41, 67). 
2nd line or greater, T790M mutation positive, advanced NSCLC patient population 
The AURA3 study demonstrated superior efficacy of osimertinib compared to chemotherapy in 
patients with advanced EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC, whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy:

Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  • For the primary objective of progression free survival (PFS) by [CONTACT_76377], 
at 59.7% mat urity, there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvement in PFS for patients on osimertinib 80 mg PO once -daily vs. those on 
chemotherapy based on investigator assessment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.41; p- value: <0.001), indicating a 70% reduction in risk of disease progression or death 
(in the absence of a Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours [RECIST] progression) in the osimertinib arm. Treatment with osimertinib resulted in a 5.7 -month 
improvement in media n PFS compared to chemotherapy (10.1 months [95% CI: 8.3, 
12.3] vs. 4.4 months [95% CI: 4.2, 5.6]). 
The superiority of osimertinib over chemotherapy for PFS was independent of 
chemotherapy regimen used in the study, and was maintained across all predefined  
demographic or disease subgroups. 
The median PFS by [CONTACT_168863] (BICR) assessment was 11.0 
months (95% CI: 9.4, not calculable [NC]) in the osimertinib arm and 4.2 months (95% CI: 4.1, 5.6) in the chemotherapy arm, (HR: 0.28, 95% CI : 0.20, 0.38; p<0.001). 
• The objective response rate (ORR; unadjusted) by [CONTACT_168864] 70.6% (95% CI: 64.9, 75.9) in the osimertinib arm vs. 31.4% (95% CI: 23.9, 39.8) in the chemotherapy arm. There was a clinically meaningful and statistical ly significant 
improvement in ORR in the osimertinib arm compared with the chemotherapy arm, with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.39 (95% CI: 3.47, 8.48) (p-value: <0.001).  
• The median DoR (51.9% maturity) based on the investigator assessment was 9.7 months 
(95% CI: 8.3, 11.6) in the osimertinib arm vs. 4.1 months (95% CI: 3.0, 5.6) in the 
chemotherapy arm. There was a statistically significant improvement in expected DoR (EDoR) for patients on osimertinib compared with those on chemotherapy (ratio of EDoR: 6.22; 95% CI: 4.04, 9.57; p-value: <0.001). 
 
• The analysis of overall survival (OS) was performed at 26.0% overall maturity. The HR of OS was 0.72 (99.96% CI: 0.34, 1.52). A numerical advantage in OS for patients on osimertinib compared to patients on chemotherapy was observed, which did not reach 
statistical significance (p -value 0.121). The median OS was not calculable in either arm, 
the lower limit of the 95% CI was 20.53 months in the osimertinib arm and 20.47 months in the chemotherapy arm 
 
• Analysis of patient -reported outcomes (PRO) findings demonstrated a statistically 
significant difference (p≤0.001) in mean change from baseline between osimertinib and chemotherapy during the overall time period from randomisation until 6 months, for all 5 pre-specified key lung cancer symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, pain in chest, fatigue, and 
appetite loss); with prolonged time to deterioriation for dyspnea and cough.

Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  • The CNS metastases efficacy analysis results in AURA3 demonstrate the superior 
efficacy of osimertinib compared  to chemotherapy in patients with CNS metastases. A 
BICR assessment of CNS efficacy in patients with CNS metastases at baseline showed a clinically meaningful improvement for patients randomised to receive osimertinib vs. chemotherapy. The improvements in CNS efficacy outcomes were consistent across multiple analyses (ORR of 70% vs 31.3%, OR of 5.13 with a p- value of 0.015; DoR 8.9 
months  vs 5.7 months; PFS 11.7 months vs 5.6 months, for osimertinib vs. chemotherapy, respectively). Efficacy findings in the  osimertinib arm of the AURA3 
study were consistent with those in the pooled Phase II studies. The  pooled single arm 
Phase II studies (AURA extension and AURA2) support the consistency and durability of effect of osimertinib 80 mg PO once -daily in a broader population of patients (including 
second [2nd] line and ≥third [3rd] line therapy) with advanced EGFR T790M mutation positive NSCLC with longer follow up. 
 
• The pooled confirmed ORR in the evaluable -for-response analysis set based on blinded 
independent c entral review (BICR; primary analysis) was 66.0% (95% CI: 61.1, 70.7).  
 
• The durability of response was confirmed with a longer follow -up: the BICR assessed 
median DoR for the pooled analysis (44.3% maturity) was 12.5 months (95% CI: 11.1, NC). Based on a K M analysis, the estimated percentage of patients remaining in response 
at 9 months was 65.0% (95% CI: 58.5, 70.6) and 52.9% (95% CI: 45.9, 59.4) at 12 months. 
 
• The median PFS in the full analysis set (FAS) was 11.0 months (95% CI: 9.6, 12.4) based on BICR assessment.  
 
• The median follow -up for OS was 13.4 months, however OS data were still immature. 
The median OS and upper limit were not calculable but the lower limit was 16.4 months 
 
• Overall, the efficacy variables determined by [CONTACT_168865] a ssessment 
showed similar results.  
 
• A BICR assessment of CNS efficacy in a subgroup of patients with CNS metastases from the pooled Phase II studies showed consistent results with the AURA3 analysis. ORR in patients was 54.0% (95% CI: 39.32, 68.19); 80.4% of patients remained in response at 6 months and 75.4% at 9 months. The Kaplan- Meier (KM) estimated percentage of patients 
alive and CNS progression- free at 6 and 12 months was 72.1% (95% CI: 56.8, 82.8) and 
56.3% (95% CI: 39.9, 69.9), respectively.  
 
In summary, the Phase III AURA3 study demonstrated clear evidence of overall favorable 
efficacy of osimertinib compared with the standard of care, chemotherapy. The CNS metastases efficacy analysis results in AURA3 also demonstrated the superior efficacy of osim ertinib 
compared to chemotherapy in patients with CNS metastases. The overall efficacy and CNS 
  
[ADDRESS_196968] of osimertinib in a broader population of patients  (including 2nd- line and 
≥3rd- line therapy) with advanced EGFR T790M mutation- positive NSCLC with longer follow -
up and are consistent with the efficacy observed with osimertinib in AURA3 
2.[ADDRESS_196969] clinical practice is to continue targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168837].  
In the AURA3 study:   
The overall incidence of all causality AEs was 97.8% for the osimertinib arm and 99.3% for the chemotherapy arm. Re gardless of causality, the majority of all adverse events (AEs) reported 
with osimertinib were mild or moderate in severity . Adverse events of Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥3 were reported for a lower proportion of patients in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm: 63 (22.6%) vs. 64 (47.1%) patients, with 16 (5.7%) and 46 (33.8%)% of CTCAE Grade ≥3 considered related treatment by [CONTACT_168866]. A number of serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for patients in the osimertinib arm than the chemotherapy arm: 50 [17.9%] vs. 35 [25.7%] patients. SAEs considered to be possibly related to study drug were less common in the osimertinib arm (8 [2.9%] patients) than the chemotherapy arm (17 [12.5%] patients)  
During the treatment period or 28- day follow -up period, death was due to disease under 
investigation plus a fatal AE in 0.7% of patients in each treatment arm; death due to a fatal AE only occurred in 0.7% osimertinib vs. no chemotherapy patients.  All other deaths were due to 
disease under investigation only. 
Osimertinib is well tolerated.  Adverse events leading to discontinuation (6.8% osimertinib arm 
vs 10.3% chemotherapy arm), dose reduction (2.9% osimertinib arm vs 12.5% pemetrexed, 28.6% cisplatin, 10.6% carboplatin of the chemotherapy arm), or dose interruption/delay (12.9% osimertinib arm vs 20.6% pemetrexed, 11.9% cisplatin, and 16.0% carboplatin) were low and less common in the osimertinib arm than in the chemotherapy arm. 
The most commonly reported AEs (ie, >15%) in the osimertinib arm vs the chemotherapy arm, 
respectively were: diarrhea  (40.5% vs. 11.0%), rash ([grouped terms] 33.7% vs. 5.9%), dry skin 
(18.6% vs. 4.4%), decreased appetite (17.9% vs. 36.0%), paronychia (16.5% vs. 1.5%), cough (16.5% vs.14.0%), nausea (16.1% vs. 49.3%), and fatigue (15.8% vs. 27.9%).

Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  ILD or ILD -like adverse reactions (eg, pneumonitis) were reported in 3.5% and were fatal in 
0.6% (5 patients) of the 833 patients who received osimertinib in AURA studies (who received at 
least one dose of 80 mg in the 2nd- line or later setting).  The incidence of ILD was 8.2% in 
patients of Japanese ethnicity, 1.9% in patients of non- Japanese Asian ethnicity and 2.9% in non-
Asian patients.  The median time to onset of ILD or ILD -like adverse reactions was 2.7 months.  
Osimertinib leads to a predicted drug -related QTc interval prolongation at the 80 mg dose of 14.2 
msec with an upper bound (90% CI) of 15.8 msec, but  with no evidence that this is associated 
with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or Torsades de Point (TdP). In safety dataset of 833 patients in AURA studies treated with osimertinib 80 mg, 0.7% (n=6) were found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec,  and 2.9% (n=24) had an increase from baseline QTc greater than [ADDRESS_196971] been observed.  
Evaluation for potential liver toxicity has shown no apparent association of osimertinib with drug induced liver injury. In the Phase II studies approximately 5% of patients reported AEs of 
elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or AST and the vast majority of these elevations 
were Grade [ADDRESS_196972] commonly reported AEs with osimertinib 
were low -grade gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances (primarily diarrhea ) and skin effects (mainly 
rashes and acnes, paronychia, and dry skin). An increased incidence in the ILD reporting rate  has been reported for the combination of 
durvalumab and osimertinib in Study D5160C00006 (the TATTON study). This study showed 
an incidence rate of 29.4% for pneumonitis/ILD -like events, at a data cut -off of [ADDRESS_196973] study- related activities, or to comply with national, state, or local laws and regulations.  Written

Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  compared with an overall frequency of pneumonitis (including both non serious and serious 
cases) of around 2% for durvalumab monotherapy across all doses and indications and an overall frequency of pneumonitis/ILD of 2.4% for osimertinib monotherapy.  
In Phase I Clinical Pharmacology studi es in healthy volunteers osimertinib was generally well 
tolerated without any significant safety concerns. The healthy volunteer dose limit is set to 80 mg as a single oral dose. Further details are provided in the osimertinib IB version 8.  
 
Clinical exper ience: Osimertinib Adverse Events 
 
Gastrointestinal tract effects  
 
Osimertinib can cause gastrointestinal tract side effects. Osimertinib has not been associated with 
gastrointestinal perforations or hemorrhagic diarrhea. No events leading to dehydration or renal failure have been reported. Investigators are advised to follow the general toxicity management guidelines regarding dose interruption and reduction as detailed in Section 9. 
 
Dermatological effects  
 
Osimertinib can cause dermatological side effects (diarrhea, rashes, acnes, paronychia and dry 
skin). No severe bullous, blistering or exfoliative skin conditions have been reported. Investigators are advised to follow the general toxicity management guidelines regarding dose interruption and re ductio n as detailed in Section [ADDRESS_196974] been reported with Osimertinib use. Investigators are 
advised to follow the general toxicity management guidelines regarding dose interruption and reduction as detailed in Section 9 .  
 
 
Cardiovascular effects  
 
Osimertinib leads to a predicted drug -related QTc interval prolongation at the 80 mg dose, but 
with no evidence that this is associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias or Torsades 
de Point (TdP). Based on available clinical trial data, a causal relationship between effects on changes in cardiac contractility and osimertinib has not been established. Investigators are advised to follow the general toxicity management guidelines regarding dose interruption and reduction as detailed in Section 9. 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_168838] -like adverse reactions  (eg, pneumonitis) have been reported in in patients who

3This visit should occur 30 days (+/ - 3 days) after study therapy stops for whatever reason (adverse event, 
progression, or at discretion of the investigator). Patients who have an ongoing grade 4 AE or SAE at the 
time of  discontinuation from study treatment will be contact[CONTACT_457] 2 weeks until the event is resolved, 
determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_093], or until the patient begins an alternate form of treatment. If 
patient is unable to make appointment due t o health reasons (e.g. patient admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]) or the visit 
would place an undue burden on the patient in the assessment of the treating physician this visit may be 
omitted.

14.0 STUDY DRUG  
14.1 Names, Classification, and Mechanism of Action  
 
Osimertinib (AZD9291, Tagrisso) is a third generation EGFR TKI. It is potent irreversible inhibitor of both single EGFR activating mutations (TKI sensitivity -conferring mutations) and 
EGFR T790M mutations (TKI resistance mutations). As a result, osimertinib has the potential to provide clinical benefit to patients with advanced NSCLC harboring both the single sensitivity mutations and the T790M resistance mutation following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI. The molecular formula is C28H33N7O2. The molecular weight is 499.6 g/mol.  
14.2 Packaging and labeling  
 
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice and local regulatory 
guidelines. The labels will fulfill Good Manufacturing Practice Annex 13 requirements for 
label ing. The label will include the Name [CONTACT_19618], Study Code, For Clinical trial use only 
and /or any other market specific  requirements. All study drugs should be kept in a secure place

SAE has occurred.  Adverse events that are judged to be Serious Ad verse Events by [CONTACT_168873] [INVESTIGATOR_168846].  
 
16.1 Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject receiving study drug and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  study treatment.  For this 
protocol, the definition of AE also includes worsening of any pre-existing medical condition.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended or worsening sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not related to use of the study drug.  Abnormal laboratory, physical exam or vital sign findings without clinical significance (based on the PI’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs 
 
From the time  that the subject signs the informed consent form through the End of Study 
Treatment  visit (as defined in Section 8.3), all AEs must be recorded in the subject medical 
record and adverse events case report form.  
 
AEs will be assessed accor ding to the CTCAE version 4.03.  If CTCAE grading does not exist 
for an AE, the severity of the AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life -
threatening (4), or fatal (5).  
 
Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows:  
- Definite:  The AE is clearly related to the study drug 
- Probably:  The AE is likely related to the study drug - Possible:  The AE may be related to the study drug - Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the study drug - Unrelated:  The AE is clearly NOT related to the study drug 
16.1. 1. Reporting of AEs  
 
All Adverse Events must be reported in routine study data submissions to the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_159919].  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., reported to the IRB, FDA, etc.) must also be reported in routine study data submissions.

Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  Abnormal laboratory results are to be records as AEs if any of the following conditions are 
met: 
• The abnormal laboratory value leads to a therapeutic intervention (e .g. corrective 
therapy).  
• The abnormal laboratory value is considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786].  
• Any lab test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE.  
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study 
treatment discontinued or interrupted  
 
16.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Astrazeneca’s product . An AE is considered “serious” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_168847]: 
 
- Results in death  
- Life-threatening  
- Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
- A medically significant condition (defined as an event that compromises subject safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the three 
outcomes above). 
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
- Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption to conduct normal life functions.  
 
 
16.2.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 Life-threatening (grade 4  or 5) SAEs, deaths, and unknown reactions or unexpected events that 
occur in the course of any patient’s treatment on study (from the time of enrollment ) or within 30 
days following cessation of study treatment are reportable.  All sites will complete DCI SAE 
Report Form and Page 1 of the DCI Safety Review Form.    Sub-sites will submit both forms to the DCI Safety Desk (Fax #: 919 -681- 9357 or email to

16.3 Safety Oversight Committee (SOC)  
 
The Duke Cancer Institute SOC is responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of  
DUHS  sponsor- investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies that do not have 
an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary focus of the SO C is 
review of safety data, toxicities and new information that may affect subject safety or 
efficacy. Annual safety reviews includes but may not be limited to review of safety data, enrollment status, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12596], accrual, toxicities, ref erence literature, and 
interim analyses as provided by [CONTACT_456] -investigator.  The SOC in concert with the DCI 
Monitoring Team (see Section 17.1 for Monitoring Team description) oversees the conduct of DUHS cancer -related, sponsor -investigator greater -than- minimal -risk intervention studies 
that do not have an external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the protocol is conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the protocol, standing operating procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements.

17.1 Monitoring  
 
The Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) Monitoring Team will conduct monitoring visits to ensure subject safety and to ensure that the protocol is conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, good clinical practice, and applicable regulatory requirements.  As specified in the DCI Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the DCI Monitoring Team will conduct routine monitoring after the third subject is enrolled, followed by [CONTACT_12636] 1 – 3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no longer receiving study interventions that are more than minimal risk.   
 
Additional monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns and may be initiated upon request of DUHS and DCI leadership, the DCI Cancer Protocol Committee, the Safety Oversight Commit tee (SOC), the sponsor, the PI, or the IRB.  All study documents must be made available 
upon request to the DCI Monitoring Team and other authorized regulatory authorities, including but not limited to the National Institute of Health, National Cancer Institute, and the FDA.  Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain confidentiality during study monitoring. 
 
Please refer to the study specific external site monitoring plan for monitoring sites external to the Duke University Heath System.  
 
17.2 Audits

[ADDRESS_197054] expected sample size under the null hypothesis (optimal) among all designs satisfying type I error of 0.[ADDRESS_197055] stage will enroll 17 patients. If there are 3 or fewer patients 
confirmed responders (complete or partial response) among the 17 patients, the trial will be terminated; otherwise, the trial will move forward to enroll additional 20 patients. If 10 or fe wer patients among the total of 37 patients are confirmed 
responders, the experimental therapy will be concluded as not worthy of further investigation; otherwise it will be conducted that the experimental therapy has sufficient activity worthy of further investigation. The above design has expected sample size [ADDRESS_197056] deviation, range, etc. will be provided for continuous data.   All enrolled patients, except for those withdraw n prior to study treatment or fail to 
receive study treatment for various reasons, will be included in the efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint will be objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Patien ts 
with confirmed partial or complete responses will be considered responders and patients without a confirmed partial or complete response will be considered non-
responders. Patients who stop therapy prior to confirmation of response per RECIST 
will be co nsidered non-responders. Patients who are not able to get radiographic 
assessment for all reasons will be considered non -responders. At the end of the trial, the 
ORR will be estimated using the UMVUE method, and the p- value and 95% 
confidence interval will calculated.

Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  24.3 APPENDIX  3: Actions Required in Cases of Combined Increase of 
Aminotransferase  and Total Bilirubin - Hy’s Law   
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study.  The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_168881] l Product (IMP).  
 The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety repor ting processes. 
 2. DEFINITIONS  
 Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)  A Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) case is defined as a study subject with an increase in serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)  together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN irrespective of serum Alkaline 
Phosphatase (ALP), at any point during the study following the start of study medication.  Hy’s Law (HL)  A Hy’s Law (HL) case is defined as a study subject with an increase in serum AST or  ALT ≥ 3x 
ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason can be found to explain the combination of increases, e.g. elevated serum ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL to be met the elevation in transaminases must  precede or be coincident with 
(i.e. on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.  
 3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES  
 
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: 
• ALT ≥ 3xULN  
•  AST ≥ 3xULN  
  
[ADDRESS_197073] study- related activities, or to comply with national, state, or local laws and regulations.  Written 
authorization from the coordinating site and sponsor is required for disclosure otherwise.  
Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  • TBL ≥ 2xULN  
The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification 
criteria are met will: 
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 of this Appendix for 
definition) by [CONTACT_48886]  
• Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF.  
 
4. FOLLOW -UP 
 
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met  
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
 
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided 
in the Clinical Stu dy Protocol. 
 
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met 
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  
• Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study treatment in the presence of liver metastases (See Section 6).  
• Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team  
• The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study subjects’ follow-up and the continuous review of data.  Subs equent to this contact [CONTACT_48887]:  
• Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. 
• Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed 
with the Study Physician. 
• Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.  
• If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures.  
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES  
 
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
 No later than [ADDRESS_197074] and TBL elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:  
 
• If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate CRF  
 
• If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF accordingly 
and follow the AZ standard processes 
 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST a nd TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:  
 
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard processes.  
• The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply 
• As there is no alternative explanation  for the HL case, a causality assessment of ‘related’ 
should be assigned. 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality 
assessment as per above  
• Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review.  
 
6. ACTIONS REQUIRED WHEN POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CRITERIA ARE MET BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING STUDY TREATMENT  
 
This section is applicable to subjects who meet PHL criteria on study treatment (including the [ADDRESS_197075] discontinuation of study treatment) having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.   At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met the Investigator will:  
 
• Determine if there has been a significant change in the subjects’ condition compared with the last visit where PHL criteria were met 
• If there is no significant change no action is required  
  
[ADDRESS_197076] study- related activities, or to comply with national, state, or local laws and regulations.  Written 
authorization from the coordinating site and sponsor is required for disclosure otherwise.  
Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  • If there is a significant change notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will inform the 
central Study Team, then follow the subsequent process described in Section 4.2 of this Appendix.  
A ‘si gnificant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a subsequent clinically relevant change 
in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associate d symptoms such as fatigue, 
vomiting, rash, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, eosinophilia.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  7. ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR REPEAT EPI[INVESTIGATOR_168858]’S LAW  
 This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment (including the 28-day follow- up period) and has already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit. 
 The requirement to conduct follow- up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL 
is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
 The investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met and answer the following question:  
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met chronic or progressing malignant disease or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in Section 6?  
 
If No:  Follow the process described in Section 4.2 of this Appendix 
 If Yes:  Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condition compared with 
when PHL criteria were previously met  
• If there is no significant change no action is required  
• If there is a significant change follow the process described in Secti on 6 of this Appendix 
 
A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a subsequent clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms, such as fatigue, 
vomiting, rash, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, eosinophilia.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the Investigator; this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  8. REFERENCES

24.4 APPENDIX 4: Measure of Effect  
 
Although response is the primary endpoint of this trial, participants with measurable disease will be assessed by [CONTACT_48928].  For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated every as per time and events table in section 8.   Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).
1.  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and 
the shortest diam eter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 Definitions  
 Evaluable for Target Disease response.   O
 nly those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one dose of study therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below  
 Evaluable Non- T
 arget Disease Response.  Participants who have l esions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one dose of study therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will 
be considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_197078] x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_197079] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if the lesion is not in bone.   Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_197080] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-m
easurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis),

Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cysti c lesions are all considered 
non-measurable.  
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred f or selection as 
target lesions.  
 Target lesions.   A
 ll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 Non-ta
rget lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 Methods for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, or a digital measurement to ol.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being

Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018  followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -
ray.   Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickn ess. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 U
se of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatl y impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow- up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines t o prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 FDG- PET.  W
 hile FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -P
 ET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
(b)  No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD. (c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
  
[ADDRESS_197083] be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to fal se positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 PET-C T. A
t present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
Response Criteria  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 Partial Response (PR) :
   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progre ss
ive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the s um must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 Stable Disease (SD) :  N
 either sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
E
valuation of Non- Target Lesio ns 
 Complete Response (CR) :
   Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in s ize (<10 mm 
short axis).

Protocol TOP 1703  
Version 2.0, 1 May 2018   
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 Non-CR/
Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  Progressive Disease (PD) :
   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.      A
lthough a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33954], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or PI).  
 
Evaluation of New Lesions 
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, 
progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as re ference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

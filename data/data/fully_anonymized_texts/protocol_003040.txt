   6 2. INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
Belatacept is a selective costimulation  blocker that prevents T- cell activation.  Belatacept is a 
fusion protein consisting of high -affinity receptor for CD80 and CD86  expressed on the surface 
of antigen- presenting cells  and the Fc portion of human IgG .  By [CONTACT_204169]80 and CD86, 
Belatacept blocks the second signal of T -cell activation thereby [CONTACT_641166].     
 
2.2. RATIONALE  
Lung transplantation is the ultimate treatment for patients with end -stage lung disease , and 
approximately 2000 patients undergo lung transplantation annually in the  [LOCATION_002] .  
However, long -term outcomes after transplantation remain disappointing, and the median 
survival after transplantation is approxim ately 5.5 years ( 1).  Infection and primary graft 
dysfunction (PGD) are the most common causes of death in the  first year after transplantation, 
but chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading cause  of death beyond the first year 
(1).  Different clinical phenotypes of CLAD have been defined including classic bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome (BOS) and  restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) , and the incidence of CLAD 
approaches 50% within 3 years of transplantation ( 2-4).  There is no effective evidence -based 
treatment for CLAD, and it typi[INVESTIGATOR_73205] a progressive  clinical course ultimately resulting i n 
allograft failure and death ( 4-6).  Indeed, the median survival after the diagnosis of CLAD is 
approximately [ADDRESS_858132] a significantly worse  quality of life ( 6, 7).  Clearly, lung tra nsplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641138].  
 The exact pathogenesis of the different phenotypes of CLAD remains unclear .  Studies have 
consistently identified multiple clinical  risk factors including primary graft dysfunction (PGD), 
acute cellular rejection (ACR), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), and the development of donor -
specific human leukocyte antigens (HLA) antibodies (DSA)  (2, 8-12).  DSA appear to play a 
central role in the development of CLAD.  Studies have consistently identified the development 
of DSA as an independent risk factor for the development of CLAD ( 11, 12).  Furthermore, DSA  
cause antibody -mediated rejection (AMR) and  are associated with an increased  risk of high 
grade and recurrent ACR as well as LB ( 13, 14 ).  In addition, DSA may mediate the increased 
risk of CLAD associated with PGD ( 15).  Lastly , experimental data suggest that DSA have a 
direct pathogenic role in the development of CLAD ( 16-18).  These data are consistent with the 
experience with DSA in kidney transplantation ( 19).  However, the development of DSA after 
lung transplantation is significantly more frequent than after kidney transplantation .  Indeed,  
single center  studies have reporte d an incidence of DSA after lung transplantation ranging 
between 25- 50%, and an incidence of 39% over the first 120 days after transplantation  was 
reported  in a recent prospective multicenter study ( 11, 12, 20).   Together, these findings 
demonstrate that D SA are common early after lung transplantation and  are associated with an 
increased risk of ACR, LB, AMR  and CLAD .  
 We hypothesize that Belatacept -based immunosuppression  (IS) will result in a lower incidence 
of DSA development and improved clinical outcomes after lung transplantation.  
 2.3. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 
 2.3.[ADDRESS_858133] of a calcineurin inh ibitor (CNI) ( 21, 22).   There have 
been no controlled studies of Belatacept in lung transplantation, but since the risk of ACR  after 
	
   [ADDRESS_858134], all study participants will be 
treated with rabbit anti -thymocyte  globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin®) for induction IS.  This is 
considered a more intensive immunosuppressive induction  agent  than bas iliximab (Simulect®) 
and clearly more intensive IS than no induction therapy.  In addition, participants randomized to 
the Belatacept arm will be treated with the combination of Belatace pt and Tacrolimus for the first 
[ADDRESS_858135] implemented 2 additional bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_641139] 120 (week 16)  and 270 (week 36)  to increase surveillance for ACR.  
 
Another  potential risk associated with Belatacept -based immunosuppression is post -transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD ) (22).  This increased risk has been identified specifically 
among Epstein- Barr Virus (EBV) seronegative  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641140].  
To minimize the risk of PTLD, we will exclude EBV seronegative patients from this study.  
 
2.3.2 . KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Belatacept -based IS has been consistently associated with better kidney function than CNI -
based therapy (21-23).  We expect participants in this study to derive a similar benefit in kidney 
function.  Furthermore, Belatacept -treated kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641141] -treated recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( 23).  The development of DSA after lung 
transplantation is significantly more frequent than after kidney transplantation, and DSA have 
been linked to all forms of lung allograft rejection.  Thus, this p otential  benefit of Belatacept -
based IS may result in better outcomes after lung transplantation.  
 
3. OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_47669] -controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of 
conducting a large -scale multicenter RCT examining the efficacy of Belatacept -based 
immunosuppression after lung transplantation.  Objective assessments of feasibility include :  
 
a. Enrollment  of 50% of e ligible  patients  at the 2 centers  
b. Randomization of 80% of eligible patients within 4 hours of completion of transplantation  
c. Retention of 75% of randomized patients  on the protocol   
d. Adherence to the study drug infusion protocol in 90% of those randomized to the 
Belatacept arm

5.3. STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
We will recruit study participants from the 2 sites’ lung transplant clinics  or inpatient services (if 
appropriate candidates are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_641144]) .  We will screen and approach 
potential participants at the time of listing for transplantation.  We will explain the study and the 
potential benefits and risks involved in participation to patients during the informed consent 
process.  The study will not enroll children (< 18 years of age) and will not enroll vulnerable participants (i.e., those who lack the capacity to consent or those who may  perceive coercion to 
participate).  We recognize the importance of minorities and women in clinical research, and we 
will not exclude participants from this study based on race or gender.   Race and gender 
characteristics of patients being listed for trans plantation are proportionate to the underlying 
diagnoses and referral patterns.  A targeted/planned enrollment table is shown below:

investigators will terminate or suspend the study if the Belatacept group has a significantly higher incidence of any of the above outcomes ( 5.5.a.-d.) than the standard of care 
immunosuppression group.  In addition, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board ( DSMB)  may 
develop additional stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641151].  Safety data including AEs, SAEs, laboratory test abnormalities, and treatment failures will be presented by [CONTACT_641167].  Summary statistics and/or  plots of the key outcomes will be provided to 
the DSMB at each meeting to allow appropriate assessment of the relative risks and benefits.  
We do not plan to include a futility monitoring plan or an efficacy -stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641152] a 
phase II trial with the potential for collecting valuable information for designing the subsequent 
clinical trial or identifying potential subgroups of interest. .  The investigators will promptly inform

7.1.3. RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE AND GROUPS  
Enrolled participants  will be assessed within 4 hours of arriving in the ICU after transplant. 
Eligible participants  will be randomized, within center, and blocked to prevent temporal bias 
using a computer -generated method with a 1:1 ratio to on one of 2 treatment assignments:  
 
a. Belatacept -based immunosuppression  
i. Belatacept + Tacrolimus + Prednisone from day 0 through day 89, then  
ii. Belatacept + Mycophenolate Mofetil  + Prednisone from day 90 through day 365  
b. Tacrolimus + Mycophenolate Mofetil + Prednisone  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_858142] OF CARE PROCEDURES  
Routine clinical assessment of study participants will be performed according to the sites’ 
clinical protocols.  After discharge from the transplant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], patients are seen in the 
lung transplant clinic  every 1-[ADDRESS_858143] spi[INVESTIGATOR_641154] (ATS) guidelines.  Unscheduled visits are arranged on 
an as -needed basis if patients develop signs or symptoms of allograft dysfunction or another  
complicating condition.  Participants will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy  (FOB) with 
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsies  (TTBX) on days 28, 84, 112, 
168, 252, and 365 (± 14 days).  In addition, patients will undergo bronchoscopy with BAL and 
lung biopsies for clinical indications (i.e., if they develop signs or symptoms of allograft dysfunction).   
 
7.3. LABORATORY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS   
Routine blood work including complete blood counts (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panels 
(CMP), blood CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and trough levels of tacrolimus  will be 
done according to the sites’ clinical protocols twice weekly during the first [ADDRESS_858144] year after transplantation.   In between these time BELA 10 mg/kg

   [ADDRESS_858145] will be performed on all women of child bearing potential at enrollment , at 
randomization , and before conversion from Tacrolimus to mycophenolate  mofetil  on day 90 for 
study participants randomized  to Belatacept therapy.   
 
Blood will be drawn for DSA  testing  on days  0 and 10 (± 3 days), and days  28, 56, 84, 112, 168, 
252, and 365 (± 14 days).  Samples  will be tested for DSA using Luminex Single Antigen Bead 
(SAB) assay  (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA) . If a sample tests positive for DSA, follow up 
testing will be performed for IgG subclasses  (IgG 1, 2, 3 and 4), and markers of complement 
binding and  activation (C1q and C3). The BUMC Transplant Immunology Lab will serve as the 
study core lab for antibod y testing . Specimens from WUSM participants will shipped to the 
BUMC core lab for processing and analysis . Blood samples will be drawn at the same time 
points for cellular immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (CIP) assays  to be p erformed at both centers using  pre-
validated DuraClone IM flow cytometry panels  (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA)  (24).  
 7.4. CONCOMITANT AND PROPHYLACTIC MEDICATIONS  
All study participants will be treated with ATG (3 mg/kg divided into 3 daily doses starting on day 0) for induction immunosuppression.  Tacrolimus will be initiated enterally or sublingually within the first 48 hours after transplantation and dosed to target a trough blood level of 8 -15 ng/mL.  
On day 90, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be substituted for tacrolimus in the Belatacept 
arm and will be dosed at 1 g twice daily (or converted to enteric coated mycophenolic acid 
(Myfortic) 720 mg twice daily in the event of gastrointestinal toxicity).  In the control arm, MMF 
will be initiated intravenously at 1 g twice daily on day 0 and will be converted to enteral dosing 
at 1 g twice daily once the patient can take oral medications or enteric coated mycophenolic 
acid (Myfortic) 720 mg twice daily in the event of gastrointestinal toxicity.  All study participants will be treated with methylpredni solone 500 mg intravenously before perfusion of the allograft 
during the transplant procedure, then methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg intravenously twice daily for 
6 doses, then prednisone 0.5 mg/kg orally daily through day 14, then 0.2 mg/kg daily through 
day 30, then 0.1 mg/kg daily through day 180, then 5 mg daily through day 365.  
 
All study participants will be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), dapsone, 
inhaled pentamidine, or atovaquone for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis throughout t he study 
period.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641155] (i.e., seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641156]) will be treated with valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis through day 
365.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641157] (i.e., seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641158]) will be treated with acyclovir or valacyclovir for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 
and varicella zoster virus (VZV) prophylaxis throughout the study period.  Antifungal prophylaxis 
will be tailored to c ulture results from bronchoscopy specimens and pre- transplant cultures.

definitions above. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscra sias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].    
g. Results in potential  Drug Induced Liver I njury (DILI)  
h. Results in suspected transmission of an infectious agent (pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug 
i. Although pregnancy, overdose and c ancer are not always considered serious by 
[CONTACT_8661], these events must be handled as SAEs.  
 The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]:  
 
a. A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours , that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
b. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
c. Admissions as per protocol for planned medical or surgical procedure  
d. Routine health assessment requiri ng admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g. routine colonoscopy)  
e. Medical / surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
f. Admission encounter ed for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical or surgical intervention (e.g. lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason.  
 
8.2. SERIOUS ADVERSE EV ENT REPORTING  – Sponsor   
	
   15 Procedures for safety reporting to BMS  (Sponsor) are described  below:  
 
a. All Serious Adverse Events (SAE s) that occur following a study subject’s  written consent 
in the study through 30 days of discontinuation of study drug dosing will be reported to 
BMS Worldwide Safety : [EMAIL_176] .  
b. A MedWatch Form 3500A  (Food & Drug Administration)  reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_641169] s. The BMS protocol ID number will be included on all Form 
3500A submitted by  [CONTACT_641170].  
c. Following the study subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, 
whether related o r not related to the study drug, are collected, including those thought to 
be associated with protocol -speci fied procedures . The I nvestigator s will report any SAE 
occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -
specified procedure. For drugs with potential for delayed SAEs (e.g. delayed excretion of 
the parent or active metabolites),  a longer follow -up period may be warranted to allow 
collection of these SAEs, laboratory tests and other assessments.  
d. The Sponsor  will reconcile the clinical database SAE cases (case level only) transmitted  
to BMS Global Pharmacovigilance  & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (GPV&E) : 
Worldwide.S [EMAIL_12222] . Reconciliation will be performed every 3 months and  prior 
to database lock or final data summary. BMS GPV&E will email, upon request from the 
Investigator s, the GPV&E reconciliation report. Requests for reconciliation should be 
sent to [EMAIL_6243] . The data elements listed on the GPV&E 
reconciliation report will be used for case identification purpos es. If the Investigator s 
determine a case was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the case will be sent immediately 
to BMS. 
e. In accordance with loca l regulations, BMS will notify Investigators of all reported SAEs 
that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not 
previously described in the investigator brochure ). An event meeting these criteria is 
termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). Investigator 
notification of these events will be in the form of a S[LOCATION_003]R report.  
f. Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_228441] (ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures that could modi fy the conduct of the study, 
lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects , clinically significant safety 
finding from a nonclinical (e.g. animal) study, important safety recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or S ponsor  decision to end or temporarily halt a 
clinical study for safety reasons.  
g. Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the I nvestigator s must review and retain the ESR 
with the investigator brochure (IB). Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a cent ral IRB/IEC for the study, the S ponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate 
IRB/IEC . The I nvestigator s and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires 
revision. The Investigator s should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting 
any other safety information.   
h. Suspected SAEs (whether expected or unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_641171] (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).   
i. SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnan cies will be reported to 
BMS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on a BMS approved MedW atch Form 
3500A ; pregnancies will be reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
SAE Email Address: [EMAIL_176]  
  SAE FAX Number:  [PHONE_188] 
	
   16  
j. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports will be submitted. 
(Follow -up SAE reports will include the same Investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
k. If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the study drug or if new 
information becomes available, a follow -up SAE report will be sent within 24 hours to 
BMS (or designee) using the same procedures used for transmitting the initial SAE 
report.  
l. All SAEs will be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 8.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  – FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) 
Procedures for safety reporting to the FDA are described below:  
 
a. Any event that is both serious and unexpected will be reported to the FDA as soon as 
possible and no later than 7 days (for a death or life-threatening event) or 15 days (for all 
other SAEs) after the Investigator or Institution’s receipt of the information. BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA.   
b. SAEs will be reported on MedWatch Form 3500 A via electronic submission  
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/ ). Alternatively, Form 3500A can be 
sent to the FDA at:

 8.4 ADVERSE EVENT  DEFINITION  
An Adverse Event  (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this t reatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational produ ct.  
 
Causal relationship to the study drug is determined by a physician and will be used to assess all 
adverse events. Th e causal relationship can be one of the following:  
 
a. Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administrati on 
and the AE.  
b. Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study drug 
administration and the AE.  
 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
 
Adverse effects can be spontane ously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject . In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.  
 8.5 NONSERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING   
A nonserious adverse event  is defined as an AE not classified as serious  
 
	
   17 a. Nonserious adverse e vents will be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or final 
study reports as specified in the agreement or as part of an annual reporting requirement 
(FDA IND).  
b. The collection of nonserious AE information will begin at the initiation of the study drug . 
All nonserious AE (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) will be collected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_858148] results  that constitute SAEs 
will be documented and reported.  
 
The following laboratory abn ormalities will be documented and reported appropriately:  
 
a. Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
b. Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued or interrupted  
c. Any l aboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy  
d. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Whenever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting o f a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential 
DILIs meeting the defined criteria will be reported as SAEs. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury is defined as:  
 
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AND  
2. Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_858149], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated 
serum alkaline phosphatase)  
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AST/ALT elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing 
chronic or acute liv er disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be 
hepatotoxic.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_858150] 5 half lives (~ 49 days) after prod uct administration, the investigational 
product will be permanently discontinued.  
 Investigators will immediately notify BMS Worldwide Safety: [EMAIL_176]  of 
the event using the Pregnancy Surveil lance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures  
 Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information will be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.  
 
	
   [ADDRESS_858151] (DSMB) is to advise on scientific, 
safety, ethical and other polic y issues relating to the study. DSMB members will:  
a. Familiarize themsel ves with the  study protocol, communicate by [CONTACT_641172] a charter.  
b. Propose appropriate analyses and meet periodically to review developi[INVESTIGATOR_641159].  
c. Desig nate a board member to record and maintain minutes for all meetings.  
d.  
 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
All power computations are based on two sided tests with p value ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_858152] a dichotomous composite primary endpoint :  the development of DSA , 
death, or re- transplantation  1 year of transplantation .  Power computations are based on various 
rates of development of the composite primary endpoint in the control group and in the Belatacept group.  The incidence of DSA within 1 year of lung transplantation has been shown 
to be 50 -60% in recent studies, and 15% of patients die or undergo re -transplantation within [ADDRESS_858153] that the incidence of 
DSA  among Belatacept -treated patients is approximately 5%. The table below provides sample 
size estimates for different DSA incidences in the 2 groups.  For example, if the incidence of 
DSA in the Belatacept group is 20% and the incidence in the control group  is 50%, the study will 
have 90% power to detect this difference if 58 subjects are enrolled in each study arm.  
 
 Power  Primary endpoint in c ontrol group

We plan to randomize 40 patients in a 1:1 fashion (20 per group); thus, we do not anticipate that 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_641160] a statistically significant difference in the 
incidence of DSA between the [ADDRESS_858154].   Nonetheless, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_641161] 95% confidence intervals of the incidence of DSA development , 
death, and re -transplantation  among lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_641162] -based 
immunosuppression.  This will be import ant in making appropriate power computations and 
sample size calculations for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_641163].  
 
9.2. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
We will compare baseline characteristics across groups using t -tests (or Wilcoxon -Rank sum 
tests if the data are not normally distribu ted) and chi -square tests.  We will use survival models 
(Kaplan -Meier method using the log rank test and Cox proportional hazards models) to compare 
freedom from the composite primary endpoint  between the [ADDRESS_858155], Edwards LB, Kucheryavaya AY, et al.  The Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation:  Thirty -second official adult lung and heart -

WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? 
We are asking you to take part in a research study. This form gives you information that will help you 
decide.   If you do decide to take part, you will be given a copy of this form to keep if you agree to take 
part. Please read this form carefully and take your time making your decision.  Ask the researcher or 
study staff any words or information that you do not understand.  You can take an unsigned copy home to 
talk with family and friends before you decide to take part.  
This study will look at the performance of a medical device called the SAVI SCOUT Surgical Guidance 
System (SAVI SCOUT, Cianna Medical, Inc.).  This device is currently on the market and is used to aid 
in the surgical removal of breast and/or axillary (underarm) lesions.  It does not contain wires or 
radioactive materials.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given its clearance for this device 
to be placed inside the breast up to [ADDRESS_451670] and/or axillary tumor lesion (target) by a 
radiologist.  The second is a hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959] (magic marker sized probe) that is placed in direct contact [CONTACT_362588]/receive radar signals from the device through a console (third part).  The 
SCOUT probe makes a sound when light and radar waves bounce off of it.  This sound directs the surgeon 
to the SAVI device at the target lesion and both are removed during the procedure.

Revised:  Version 1.[ADDRESS_451671] placing a wire (part inside the breast 
and part outside the breast) or placement of radioactive seeds into the target area to mark the area before 
surgery.    
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (small) study to test the SAVI SCOUT system’s performance over a longer duration (31 to 
365 days) in women receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy, biologics or hormone treatment 
before surgery to shrink their breast and/or axillary cancer tumor.  Giving chemotherapy, biologics or 
hormones to reduce the tumor size before surgery is called neoadjuvant treatment.  The SAVI SCOUT was 
approved by [CONTACT_362589] 31, 2017. Information about placement and removal of the 
device, and preliminary safety information will be collected. 
In some women who receive neoadjuvant treatment, the breast and/or axillary tumor and lymph nodes 
can shrink completely so that no remaining cancer can be found. This cannot always be predicted in 
advance.  While this shrinkage is good for the patient, it can result in difficulty locating the initial target 
lesion(s) area on imaging studies. This may result in more imaging to locate the original target area(s) and 
placement of wires, SAVI reflectors, or other devices to mark the spot of the original tumor(s) before 
surgery.       
If the SCOUT device(s) is placed prior to neoadjuvant treatment when the lesion(s) is larger and more 
clearly seen on imaging, then the target lesion(s) may be located better after a treatment response without 
the need for additional imaging or devices.  This may lead to a more accurate surgical procedure.  If this 
study demonstrates that the SAVI SCOUT system can stay in its original location and be removed 
surgically, this may mean that future patients may require fewer and/or less expensive imaging or 
procedures before surgery. 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
The study population consists of up to [ADDRESS_451672] cancer treatment followed by [CONTACT_44850].  This study will be conducted within Memorial 
Healthcare System.  
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME ON THIS STUDY?
Your breast surgeon will determine if you are eligible for this study.  Once you decide to take part, you 
will be asked to read and sign this consent. You will be scheduled for the SAVI SCOUT device(s) 
procedure (31-365 days prior to surgery). The SCOUT device is placed using a needle. The breast and/or 
axillary area is injected with numbing medication before placing the device. One to four SCOUT devices 
may be placed based on your surgeon’s choice. In this research study we will collect data on up to four 
SCOUT device(s) placed. Your medical oncologist will determine which neoadjuvant treatment is right 
for you.  Your participation in this study will not affect which treatment is given to you.  Upon completion 
of your neoadjuvant treatment, you will be scheduled for surgery.

Revised:  Version 1.4  15 May 2018, SAVI SCOUT ICFApproximately 30 days before surgery, you will return to the radiology department for a recheck of the 
SAVI SCOUT device(s) and routine pre-operative skin marking. The SCOUT probe will be placed over 
the breast and/or axillary area to listen for the sound that the device is in place.  If the device is found, no 
further device placement will be needed other than routine imaging prior to the surgery.   You will then 
have the surgery, and the surgeon will remove the device and the breast and/or axillary target tissue.  
Information will be collected from your health and imaging records to look at the performance of the 
device(s) and any problems from the device.  
If the device(s) cannot be located, the radiologist will talk with your surgeon to see if another device(s) 
(SAVI SCOUT or wire) should be placed.  This will be done at no additional cost to you.  If you have 
surgery at another location then we will collect information from the surgical record to see if the SAVI 
SCOUT system was used and the SAVI device(s) removed and problems from the device(s).  Imaging 
scans and pathology results will be captured.   
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?
Your participation will be completed after your surgical procedure to remove the SCOUT device(s).  
Information from your medical record will be collected including your treatment, tumor results, imaging, 
and surgical procedures. 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY? 
Medicine is not an exact science.  No one can promise that you will have a good result from taking part in 
this study.  There is a risk of rare bad results.  There is a risk of bad results that were not known before.  
The risks of SCOUT device(s) placement are similar to or less than wire placement:  bleeding, injury to 
vessels, nearby [CONTACT_362590], pain, infection and repeating the procedure. 
The most significant risk for this study is if the surgeon may not be able to successfully remove the 
device(s) and/or target lesion(s). This has not occurred to date in our clinical (greater than 150 patients; 
greater than 200 devices) experience at Memorial Healthcare System with our experienced breast 
surgeons.  If this happens another surgery may be needed to remove the target lesion.  The device(s) may 
be able to be removed during the next surgery or by [CONTACT_362591] a needle.  
Another potential risk to the patients is that the SCOUT device(s) might move during the 31-365 day time 
period. This could possibly require a longer procedure to remove the lesion(s) and/or retrieve the 
device(s). This has occurred to date in our clinical experience in less than 1% of our initial 150 patients, 
which is less than half of the risk of the wire device risk (2-3%), which has been reported in the United 
States for over 30 years. 
If the SCOUT device(s) is not detected (no sound) at the [ADDRESS_451673] of care procedure (wire or SAVI SCOUT as determined by [CONTACT_7995]).  This standard 
of care procedure will be done at no additional cost.  However, this may result in a slight increased 
procedure time since the first SCOUT device(s) will need to  be removed in addition to the subsequent 
selected device(s).  We anticipate this risk to be less than 1% (1/150 patients), which is less than routine 
standard of care (2-3%) wire procedure done before surgery. Fainting or mild light-headedness (vasovagal)

Revised:  Version 1.4  15 May 2018, SAVI SCOUT ICFrisks can occur with wire placement before surgery (2-3%).  To date, our local experience has not 
identified this risk with SAVI SCOUT. 
In a small percentage of patients following neoadjuvant treatment, the tumor has not shrunk completely. 
The surgeon may be able to locate the target lesion without the need for any devices to assist the location 
of the target. If this were to happen, you may not have needed the SAVI SCOUT procedure or other 
procedures (example: wire) before surgery. This cannot be predicted in advance.
We do not know how the device will interfere with pacemakers, so notify the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_362584].  Surgery and neoadjuvant treatments may affect an unborn child.  We do not know if this 
device will affect an unborn child.  Please discuss your participation in this study with the Study doctor if 
you are pregnant.  You agree to notify the study doctor if you become pregnant during this study.     
The risk of being in any study is a loss of the privacy of your information.  Several means will be used to 
minimize this risk, as described below in the section “WILL MY MEDICAL INFORMATION BE 
KEPT PRIVATE?”
WILL I BENEFIT FROM THIS STUDY?
We cannot guarantee that you will benefit from taking part in this study.  If the target lesion(s) is more 
easily seen, this may help with surgical removal.  Your taking part may help patients in the future.  
ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS?
You do not have to take part in this study.  You can have the standard of care procedure done (wire or 
SAVI SCOUT) just before surgery depending on what your surgeon chooses.  You do not have to give 
your permission to use or give out your health information.  Your healthcare providers’ attitude about you 
or your care will not be affected by [CONTACT_362592].

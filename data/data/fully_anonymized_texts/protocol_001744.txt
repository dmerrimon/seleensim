 PRÉCIS  
Background 
• Recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_28617] (RRP) is a rare papi[INVESTIGATOR_770858] (HPV). 
• RRP can progress to cause airway compromise, fatal pulmonary lesions, and invasive cancers.  
• There is no effective systemic therapy for RRP. Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_770859]. 
• A recently completed phase II clinical trial investigating avelumab in subjects with 
aggressive RRP demonstrated an acceptabl e safety profile  from  avelumab  and a high rate of 
partial responses . 
• RRP is characterized by [CONTACT_770914]-L1 and TGF-beta in the tumor 
microenvironment. 
• This clinical trial will evaluate the activity of M7824, a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against human PD-L1 (avelumab) fused, via a flexible glycine-serine linker, to the soluble extracellular domain of human TGF-β receptor II (TGF -βRII), which functions as a TGF- β “trap.” This drug was selected for its 
demonstrated activity in a variety of cancers and for its acceptable safety profile.  
Objective  
• Determine the complete response rate for M7824 in the treatment of patients with RRP.  
Eligibility  
• Histologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP.  
• One of the following:  
o A Derkay anatomic score of [ADDRESS_1058253] 12 months or a tracheostomy. 
• Age 18 years or greater. 
• Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group Performance Score of 0 or 1.  
Design  
• This is a p hase II clinical trial  with two cohorts that will enroll simultaneously.  
• Cohort [ADDRESS_1058254] a Simon optimal two -stage design with initial enrollment of 12 patients and expansion to 21

ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_28617] ( RRP ) 
RRP is a rare but difficult -to-treat and sometimes fatal neoplastic disease of the aerodigestive 
tract. RRP is cau sed by [CONTACT_770915][INVESTIGATOR_28597] ( HPV) type 6 or 11, or more rarely 
type 16 ( 1). Approximately 1,500 new cas es of RRP are diagnosed each year in the [LOCATION_002]  
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/2020

 (2). RRP  is classified based on age of onset as juvenile or adult. Juvenile- onset disease has an 
incidence of 4/100,[ADDRESS_1058258] an aggressive clinical course.  Adult -onset RRP has an 
incidence of 2 -3/100,[ADDRESS_1058259] occlusion, loss of lung volume, and/or pneumonia ( 3). 
Repeated procedures  are required to debulk and monitor the disease, which exposes patients to 
anesthetic and surgical risk, and emotional distress. It is estimated that the economic cost of RRP 
is $150M in the [LOCATION_002] each year  (2). Although rare (one to three percent of cases) RRP 
can transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma ( 4). Subsequent mortality is based upon the 
clinical stage of the malignancy at the time of diagnosis. 
There is no cure for RRP . The mainstay  of treatment is endoscopic debulking with ablation or 
excision of papi[INVESTIGATOR_770860]. Surgical principles dictate that, to minimize morbidity from treatment,  papi[INVESTIGATOR_770861]. It is thought 
that latent HPV viral particle s persist in an inactive state in the clinically -normal mucosa and 
subsequently become re activated leading to RRP recurrence ( 5
). Patients with juveni le-onset 
RRP require on average 20 surgeries over their lifetime to control their disease ( 6). Patients with 
adult-onset RRP generally  requir e fewer  interventions; nonetheless greater than 50% will require 
5 or more procedures  to control symptoms ( 7). Adjuvant systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_770862] , including systemic interferon- α and local  injection of anti -viral and antiangiogenic 
agent s (5). Study results have been inconsistent, and no single adjuvant a pproach has been 
widely adopted or accepted as the standard of care.  
RRP is caused by [CONTACT_448248].  HPV infections are common, but most individuals clear the virus without manifesting papi[INVESTIGATOR_28603], dysplasia, or invasive cancers ( 8
).  Why some 
immunocompetent individuals are unable to eliminate the virus and therefore develop papi[INVESTIGATOR_770863].  Local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_770864]. This notion is supported by a study demonstrating the presence of HPV DNA in the clinically healthy mucosa of patients with RRP (
9, 10 ). Efforts  to study systemic immunotherapy for RRP have been limited.  Adjuvant 
IFN-α after papi[INVESTIGATOR_770865]-term time to recurrence but did not 
demonstrate long- term benefit ( 11).  
Programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) exp ression on tumor cells has been associated  strongly with 
poor prognosis in a variety of human cancers. ( 12) In recent years, a number of agents targeting 
the p rogrammed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 pathway have received regulatory appr oval, 
demonstrating impressive durations of response for multiple  tumor types, including melanoma, 
non-small cell lung  cancer, renal cell  cancer , and head and neck cancer ( 13-17 ). Notably, 
atezolizumab , durvalumab and avelumab are all anti–PD -L1 antibodies with proven efficacy and 
regulatory approval. Study of a small number of RRP samples by [CONTACT_770916]- L1 
expression by [CONTACT_770917][INVESTIGATOR_770866]  (18). In 
response to this data, we recently completed a phase II study investigating the role of avelumab in patients with aggressive RRP. We found that while the majority of patients de monstrated 
partial responses to single agent avelumab (
Figure 1) , no complete responses were achieved.  
Toxicities were generally mild and comparable to previous safety data with avelumab.

1.2.2 TGF -β/ TGF βR1 signaling pathway 
In an effort to increase the rate of response to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical trials are evaluating anti –
PD-1/PD-L1 agents in combination with other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( 19). Importantly, combined 
inhibition  of PD -L1 and TGF- β is a promising  therapeutic strategy because these key pathways 
have independent immunosuppressive functions.  
Transforming growth factor β (TGF -β) is a pleiotropic cytokine. In patients with cancer, TGF -β 
is associated with malignant progression, evasion of immune surveillance, invasion, and 
metastasi s (20, 21 ). TGF -β Receptor 1 (TGF βR1) pathway signalling  and overexpression have 
also been found to be significantly associated with HPV+ cancers  (22). Based on two genome 
wide association studies (GWAS) which compared patients with upper aero-digestive (n= 2091) and cervical cancers (n=617) to cancer free patients (8,334 and 512 respectively), an integrative computational analysis (including single-gene, gene-interconnectivity, protein–protein interaction, gene expression, and pathway analysis) looked to identify immune genes and pathways significantly associated with HPV+ cervical and oropharyngeal cancer. They found that TGF βR1 expression and downstream signalling was significantly increased in HPV+ 
cervical cancer and head and neck cancer s (
22). Similarly, TGF -β has been shown to be 
significantly expressed in the microenvironment of RRP specimens ( 23). 
 The direct effects of TGF -β on T cells include decreases in perforin, granzymes, interferon 
gamma, Fas ligand, and natural killer group 2D (NKG2D). It can also decrease NKG2D and major histocomp atibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide sequence A (MICA) in natural 
killer ( NK) cell s (24
). Elevated levels of TGF -β have been found to correlate with poor outcomes 
in many different human cancer s (25). Antibodies (e.g., fresolimumab) and small- molecule 
inhibitors (e.g., galunisertib) targeting the TGF- β pathway have entered clinical development, 
where they have shown promise in hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma (
26).

“trap.” The anti -D-L1 moiety of M7824 is based on avelumab (MSB0010718C), which is 
currently in Phase III  clinical trials in multiple tumor types and was recently FDA approved for 
metastatic Merkel cell Carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma ( 27, 28
). Preclinical studies have 
shown its ability to simultaneously bind PD- L1 and TGF -β, as well as appropriately block PD -
L1 signaling and TGF- β signaling in vitro. M7824 was shown to have better antitumor efficacy 
than anti- PD-L1 or TGF -β trap  control (a mutated antibody that doesn't bind to PD-L1, linked 
with the TGF -β trap ) in both MC38 and EMT-[ADDRESS_1058261] cancer model using B cell -deficient Jh mice M7824 
showed much better activity than either anti -PD-L1 antibody alone or TGF- β trap control  
(Figure 2)

tumors showing significantly reduced tumor volume with M7824 ( anti-PD-L1/TGFβ)  compared with 
either anti -PDL1 antibody or TGF- β trap alone.  
At tumor re -challenge, 13/13 mice previously cured with M7824 treatment had complete 
protection. Furthermore, M7824 therapy extended survival in a dose dependent manner. Similar 
results were also observed in the MC38 colorectal carcinoma model. Furthermore, depletion studies in MC38 model demonstrated that both CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells are required for tumor rejection ( Figure 3).

:  Antibody -based, selective depletion of immune effector cell subsets showed that both CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells and NK cells are required for tu mor rejection with M7824 (Anti -PD-L1/TGFβ Trap) in 
MC38 model.  
 
In in vivo  studies, not only did M7824 decrease TGF- β in the serum and bind PDL1 within the 
tumor, it also substantially increased CD8+ T- cell and NK cell infiltration within the tumor, 
while decreasing myeloid -derived suppressor cell (MDSC) infiltration, compared with an anti–
PD-L1 antibody control. 
Based on these preclinical data, a Phase I  3+3 dose- escalation study was completed to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability, and biological and clinical activity of M7824 in 
patients with advanced solid tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Sixteen heavily  pretreated patients received M7824 at 1, 3, 10, or 20 mg/kg once- every -2-weeks. 
M7824 was shown to saturate peripheral PD-L1 at doses ≥  3 mg/kg and sequester plasma TGF -
β1, -β2, and - β3 (Figure 4) throughout the dosing period at ≥1 mg/kg. The only DLT observed 
was colitis with associated anemia (20 mg/kg). No MTD was reached. Grade 3 treatment -related 
adverse events occurred in 3 patients (skin infection secondary to localized bullous pemphigoid 
(3 mg/kg), asymptomatic lipase increase (20 mg/kg), and colitis (20 mg/kg) with associated anemia).  These toxicities are on par with other PD -1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The only added toxicity 
seen over traditional PD-1/PD- L1 inhibitors was the occurrence of keratoacanthomas which have 
been described previously with TGFβ inhibitors  (29
).  Keratoacanthomas appear in 
approximately 10% of treated patients, but usually resolve with discontinuation of therapy. There were no treatment -related grade 4 –5 events. Based upon this safety data the decision was made 
to treat subsequent patient cohorts with a dose of 1,200 mg IV once every 2 weeks. This dose has been used in several phase Ib expansion cohorts treating more than 500 patients. This dose has been recommended for all phase II trials using M7824.

In addition, in the ongoing Phase I study of M7824 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), substantial clinical 
evidence has been seen in 4 of 9 subjects  (44%) with HPV -associated malignancies, including 2 
of 5 patients (40%) with metastatic cervical cancer,  1 of 2 patients (50%) with metastatic anal 
cancer  and 1 of 2 patients (50%) with metastatic P16+ head and neck cancer have had substantial 
clinical benefit.

 Figure 5: This 56- year-old woman with initially locally advanced cervical cancer status post 
(s/p) cisplatin/RT developed metastases to lung within 3 months of initial treatment. Then went 
on to receive topotecan/taxol plus bevacizumab and was enrolled on phase I of M7824 with enlarging right-sided lung masses (arrows in left side of figure). She received 2 doses of M7824 at 20 mg/kg but then developed colitis necessitating drug discontinuation. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_770867] 12 weeks showed marked reduction in disease volume (right side of figure).  
This includes a subject  with metastatic cervical c ancer with a 25% reduction  (by [CONTACT_770918])  in her disease at 3 months ( Figure 5), a subject  with metastatic P16+ head and 
neck cancer with an unconfirmed partial response 6 weeks after startin g treatment, a patient w ith 
metastatic anal cancer with normalization of tumor markers and an ongoing durable partial response 9 months after starting treatment and a patient with metastatic cervical cancer with normalization of tumor markers and an ongoing durable complete response for more than a year .     
This e arly data from a small cohort of subjects  with HPV- associated malignancies in this  phase 1 
trial of M7824 suggests that this agent, which targets both PD-L1 and TGF- β pathways, may 
produce responses at a higher rate as compared with other single agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Here, we aim to assess the clinical response rate following treatment with M7824 in subjects with aggressive RRP.

Randomization 
Patients in Cohorts [ADDRESS_1058272] s with  an RRP  
disease burden that requires repeated surgical  procedures for  management .  Patients with  a 
pathologically confirmed diagnosis of RRP will be screened for this protocol.  P atients who 
appear to be eligible for treatment will be examined via flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy 
and/or tracheoscopy by [CONTACT_770921]. Patients  that meet the eligibility  criteria  will 
be enrolled onto  the study. This study will have two cohorts: (1) patients who are checkpoint 
inhibitor naive, and (2) patients whose RRP disease is refractory to checkpoint inhibition. After enrollment, patients will undergo exam under anesthesia (EUA) staging of RRP with biopsies to 
confirm baseline staging, debulk disease that poses an impending airway risk  and rule out 
invasive cancer . Patients will complete the Voice Handicap Index -10 at this time.  The voice 
handicap index- 10 (VHI -10) is a patient- based self -assessment tool that quantifies a patients’ 
perception of their voice handicap. It consists of 10 questions that cover three domains: functional, physical and emotional aspects of voice disorders. There is a positive correlation 
between improvement in anatomic Derkay score and  mean VHI -10 score ( 35).

of treatment their responses will again be measured after completing this additional treatment (+/- 10 days). Patients that have a partial response at the end of course 2 can choose to receive 
more courses of therapy  (maximum of 2) or conclude therapy. Patients will be assessed after 
each course. At the conclusion of treatment all patients will undergo EUA and endoscopy with 
either st andard of care surgical debulking of their disease or biopsies to confirm complete 
regression of papi[INVESTIGATOR_770871]. The primary endpoint of this study is complete response to treatment , but patients will be followed long- term after completion of treatment to assess timing 
and frequency of future interventions.   
If a patient’s condition precludes safe performance of any protocol-driven biopsy, apheresis or 
other research procedure, the procedure may be delayed for an additional two weeks or canceled  
at the discretion of the investigator. This will not be considered a protocol deviation.  Endoscopy may be omitted in patients with disease that is not endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_770869].

RUG ADMINISTRATION  
3.2.1 M7824 
M7824 will be administered via peripheral IV at a dose of 1200 mg IV every other week  for up 
to 12 weeks total (6 cycles) .  All patients will be pre -treated with an antihistamine  and 
acetaminophen approximately 30-60 minutes prior to each dose (for example, 25-50 mg 
diphenhydramine and  500-650 mg acetaminophen ). M7824 is to be diluted as described in 
section 11.1.4. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection.   M7824 will be infused at 60 mL/hour for 10 minutes; if no infusion reaction observed then rate 
will be increased to 120 mL/hour for 10 minutes; if no infusion reaction observed then rate will 
be increased to 250 mL/hour for the remainder of the infusion. If infusion reactions are observed, the infusion rate may be decreased to the previous rate at w hich it was tolerated. At the end of 
the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  See Section 3.4.[ADDRESS_1058279].  Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature) will be assessed before 
infusion, at each rate change, at completion of infusion, and every 1 hour (+/- 15 minutes) or 
more frequently as clinically indicated  for 2 hours after completion of the infusion or until stable.   
Medications readily available for the emergency management of anaphylactoid reactions should include: epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000, 1 mg/mL) for subcutaneous injection, diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment.

See the section  3.5, Study calendar for details. 
3.4 DOSE MODIFICATIONS /DELAY  
Dose modifications are not permitted.  
3.4.1 Doses will be delayed for the following: 
• Any Grade 2 or greater drug- related adverse event  with the  following exceptions : 
o Grade 2 skin rash or fatigue 
o Grade 2 infusion reaction in which the full dose of the drug is safely infused, 
per instructions in section 3.4.4 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication   
• Algorithms for management of toxicities are provided in Section  13.3 
3.4.2 Resuming treatment 
Subjects may resume treatment with M7824 under any  of the following circumstances: 
• Any grade 2 event that resolves to grade 1 or less within 14 days without systemic steroid treatment  
• Grade 3/4 rash that improves to Grade 1/2 with treatment 
• Grade 2/3/4 endocrinopathy that responds to  treatment/replacement therapy   
3.4.3 Discontinuing treatment 
Treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following: 
• Any Grade [ADDRESS_1058281] with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus , arthralgias, 
hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 5.0) guidelines.

 NCI-CTCAE Grade  Treatment Modification for Study Drug  
Grade 1 – mild   
Mild transient reaction; infusi on interruption 
not indicated; intervention not indicated. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms.  
Decrease the study drug infusion rate by 50% and monitor 
closely for any worsening.  Complete the remainder of the 
infusion at the reduced  rate (50% of initial infusion rate) . 
The total infusion time for study drug should not exceed 4 
hours. 
Grade 2 – moderate 
Therapy or infusion interruption indicated 
but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment (for example, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics,  corticosteroids, 
bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤  24 hours. Stop study drug infusion.  Once infusion- related reaction 
has resolved or decreased to G rade 1 in severity, r esume 
infusion at 25% of previous rate  for 15 minutes, then 
increase to 50% of previous rate, and monitor closely for 
any worsening. 
The total infusion time for study drug should not exceed 4 
hours. 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or 
life-threatening ; urgent intervention 
indicated.  Grade 3: Prolonged (for example, 
not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_13081]/or brief interruption of 
infusion); recurrence of symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770872]   [e.g., 
renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). 
Grade 4: (life- threatening; pressor or 
ventilator support indicated). 
 
 Immediately discontinue infusion of study drug. Begin an 
IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject a s 
follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. 
Subject should be monitored until the investigator is 
comfortable that the symp toms will not recur. Study drug 
will be permanently discontinued. In the case of late -
occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after 
treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given ( e.g., oral 
antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  Subjects must be 
withdrawn immediately from study drug treatment and 
must not receive any further study d rug treatment.  
IV = intravenous; NCI-CTCAE = National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event; NSAIDs
 = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Once the M7824 infusion rate has been decreased by 50% or interrupted due to an 
infusion-related reaction, it must remain decreased for all subsequent infusions.  If a subject experiences a Grade [ADDRESS_1058282], the patient will be referred to Dermatology for 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/[ADDRESS_1058283] available medical practice. Subjects should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the Investigator immediately.  
For prophylaxis of flu-like symptoms, 25 mg of indomethacin or comparable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) dose (for example, ibuprofen 600 mg, naproxen sodium 
500 mg) may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of M7824 IV infusion.  Alternative treatments for fever (for example, paracetamol) may be given to subjects at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3.4.7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
In addition, since M7824 can induce antibody- dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, there is a 
potential risk of tumor lysis syndrome.  Should this occur, subjects should be treated per the local 
guidelines.

• Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system .  Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be 
followed.  Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if required . 
• Samples will be archived by [CONTACT_510290] (PDCMF). All data associated with archived clinical research samples is entered into LabMatrix . Access to this folder is limited to PDCMF staff and ETIB clinical staff, 
Abbreviated Title:  M7824  in RRP  
Version Date:  12/1/[ADDRESS_1058313]. All staff in the PDCMF laboratory receives 
annually updated NIH/CIT training and maintains standards of computer security. 
• The data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, trial name/protocol number, date drawn, treatment cycle/post -transplant time point, cell source (e.g. peripheral blood, 
lymph apheresis, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, marrow, urine, skin or oral biopsy) as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics that correla te treatment 
outcomes and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_257384]/ETIB clinical records. As of January 2007, all newly received samples receive a unique bar code number, which is included in the sample record in the PDCMF database. Only this bar code is recorded on the sample vial and the vials will not be traceable back to patients without authorized access to the PDCMF database. All non-coded samples previously archived will be stripped of identifiers prior to distribution for any use other than as a primary objective of the protocol under which they were collected. 
• Samples are stored in locked freezers. All samples will be labeled solely with a bar code (which includes the date, and serially determined individual sample identifier) . The key 
will be available to a restricted number of ETIB investigators and associate investigators on the protocol. Coded samples will be stored frozen at -20°, -80° or liquid nitrogen vapor phase according to the stability requirements under the restricted control of the PDCM Facility of ETIB.  
• Access to samples from a protocol for research purposes will be by [CONTACT_79923] [INVESTIGATOR_483434] (1) for research purposes associated with protocol objectives for whi ch the samples were collected, or (2) for a new 
research activity following submission and IRB approval of a new protocol and consent, or (3) for use only as unlinked or coded samples under the OHSRP Exemption Form guidelines stipulating that the activity is exempt from IRB review. Unused samples must be returned to the PDCMF laboratory. 
• Samples, and associated data, will be stored permanently unless the patient withdraws consent. If researchers have samples remaining once they have completed all studies associated with the protocol, they must be returned to the PDCMF laboratory. 
• These freezers are located onsite at the PDCMF laboratory (12C216) or in ETIB common 
equipment space (CRC/3 -3273). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hinrichs laboratory

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Disease stage and response will be determined  by [CONTACT_770931]/or 
tracheoscopy  using the Derkay staging system if the patient does not have pulmonary disease 
and/or by [CONTACT_770932] ( 6). The Derkay staging system has been 
validated with a high degree of inter- rater reliability  (31). It incorporates an objective score 
based on the number of sites and bulkiness of papil lomas  within the pharynx, larynx and trachea 
and a subjective score determined by [CONTACT_770933].  Physical exam and/or 
clinic -based endoscopy will be used to visualize all accessible papi[INVESTIGATOR_770892].  Only lesions that can be visualized by [CONTACT_6903] -based 
flexible nasophar yngolaryngoscopy and/or tracheoscopy will be included in the baseline score 
used for assessing treatment response.  This score must be [ADDRESS_1058315] performing the procedure. Final 
reporting of clinical responses will be based on a blinded review of endoscopic video and or photos by [CONTACT_770934]. 
Response and progression from imaging studies will be e valuated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) ( 32
).  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
If a subject has disease being assessed by [CONTACT_770935]- based flexible 
nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or tracheoscopy, no Derkay score will be calculated. This will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
6.3.1 Baseline assessment

EPORTING PREGNANCY  
8.5.1 Maternal  exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy become known, 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria ( 8.1.2) should be reported as SAEs .  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented.

CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_1058327] annually in a summary format.  
9 CLINICAL  MONITORING  
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could affect the interpretation of primary  and secondary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study data with source documentation focusing on: 
• Informed consent process 
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability 
• Adverse events monitoring 
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring program also extends to multi- site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR contractor. Monitors are qualified by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.

Version Date:  12/1/[ADDRESS_1058329] RRP disease which is refractory to checkpoint inhibition. In each of the two cohorts, the trial will be conducted using a Simon minimax two-stage design; the objective is to rule out a 5% complete response rate (p0=0.05) and target a 20% complete response rate (p1=0.20).   
With amendment D, cohort 2 will be closed to further enrollment.  The design will use alpha=0.10 (10% chance of accepting a poor agent) and beta=0.20 
(corresponding to 80% power --and 20% chance of incorrectly rejecting a promising agent). T he 
first stage of accrual will consist of 12 evaluable patients. If 0/[ADDRESS_1058330] complete responses in 21 patients in a cohort (14.3%), then the results will be considered sufficiently promising for further evaluation in that cohort. Under the null hypothesis (5% complete response rate) , the probability of early termination is 54.0%.  
It is anticipated that up to 1 patient per month may enroll onto this trial; thus, 2 to 3 years may be required to complete accrual. The trial would require up to 21 total evaluable patients  in cohort 
1; the accrual ceiling will be set at 26 patients to allow for a small number of in evaluable patients  
as well as to accommodate the 2 subjects enrolled in cohort 2 prior to its closure. 
10.1.4 Populations for Analysis 
Modified intention to treat: all patients who rece ive at least one dose of the agent will be 
included in the statistical analyses performed.

TATISTICAL ANALYSES  
10.2.1 General Approach  
Separately by [CONTACT_9084], the proportion of evaluable patients who experience a CR will be reported 
along with a confidence interval; the proportion of patients who experience a PR will also be reported along with a confidence interval. 
10.2.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
In each of the two cohorts, the fraction of evaluable patients who experience a complete response 
will be d etermined and this fraction will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval. 
10.2.3 Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
In each of the two cohorts, the fraction of evaluable patients who experience a partial response will be determined and this fra ction will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval.

None will be performed. 10.2.7 Subgroup Analyses 
Results will be reported according to the cohort in which the patient was enrolled. 10.2.8 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data  
No individual participant data is intended to be reported. 10.2.9 Exploratory analyses 
Exploratory analyses may include the following: 
• Evaluation of PD-L1 and/or TGF- β expression as a potential biomarker of response by 
[CONTACT_770939] (PR +CR) and non-responders, 
separately within each cohort, using an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test 
• Evaluation of HPV type as a potential biomarker of response by [CONTACT_770940]. non-responders varies by [CONTACT_770941]’s exact test or Mehta’s modification to Fisher’s exact test, depending on the number of categories of HPV type being evaluated (2 vs. 3)

requiring repeated procedures for disease control. There is no curative therapy for these patients and their disease causes substantial morbidity and occasional mortality. Subjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria.  To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in disease response would be expected in one group compared to another.  Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck bet ween patient 
safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand.  If differences in outcome that correlate to gender or to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.  
There is no effective systemic therapy for patients with RRP.

TRATEGIES /PROCEDURES FOR RECRUITMENT  
Patients for this protocol will be recruited via standard CCR mechanisms as well as various 
advertising venues.  All advertisem ents, letters and other recruitment efforts will be submitted to 
the IRB for approval prior to their implementation.   
12.3 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M7824 in patients 
<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.    
12.4 P
ARTICIPATION OF PREGNANT WOMEN  
Based on its mechan ism of action and data from animal studies, M7824 can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. Human IgG 1 is known to cross the placental barrier 
and M7824 is an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG 1); therefore, M7824 has the potential to be 
transmitted from the mother to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. Given these risks, pregnant women will be excluded from this study and patients of both genders must be willing to practice contraception throughout M7824 treatment and for at least 120 days after M7824 treatment . 
12.5 E
VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The experimental treatment has a chance to provide clinical benefit though this is unknown. The safety profile of M7824 has been established in treatment of over [ADDRESS_1058334] compromise, lung compression and 
infection, and transformation to invasive cancer. If this study has a positive outcome it will provide benefit to not only the patients on the study but also to future patients. This study may

 also contribute to our knowledge of the mechanism of action of M7824 and the biology or RRP 
that will help to advance treatment of RRP and other diseases.  
12.5.1 Summary of risks and potential benefits 
This clinical trial is being performed to evaluate M7824 for RRP. Only patients with a substantial disease burden (Derkay anatomic score of 10 or greater) that requires repeated endoscopic interventions (two or more procedures in the last 12 months) will be eligible for treatment. While the vast majority of patients with RRP experience an acceptable level of disease control with infrequent surgical debulking, a small subset of patients have very aggressive disease that requires frequent operative intervention, carries the risk of airway obstruction and the need for a tracheostomy, and affects their voice and breathing to a degree that negatively impacts their quality of life. The inclusion criteria for this study captures these 5-10% of patients 
most severely affected. Patients with disease that has not met this level of severity will not be subjected to the risks of treatment.  The primary protocol risks are the toxicities of M7824. There may be add itional risks of treatment that are specific to RRP such as swelling or progression of 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_770898]. In addition, there are risks from the general anesthesia and procedures to stage and monitor the disease. General anesthesia will be employed during an initial evaluation to stage the disease, confirm the diagnosis, and debulk papi[INVESTIGATOR_770899]. It will be used again two weeks after the initiation of treatment at which time the airway will be assessed  for safety. A final procedure under anesthesia will be 
performed at the completion of treatment to remove residual papi[INVESTIGATOR_770900]. Rare but serious complications can occur with general anesthesia including cardiopulmonary compromise, stroke, and death. In this protocol they are offset substantially by [CONTACT_770943], extent of disease, and in some cases surgical removal of disease that is gained by [CONTACT_394339].  
12.5.[ADDRESS_1058335] are discussed in Section 11.1.3. 12.5.3 Exam under anesthesia and biopsy r isks 
Exam under anesthesia (EUA) is associated with the risk of sedation or general anesthesia. 
Complications of general anesthesia are rare. Serious risks include allergic reaction to a drug, loss of airway control and ventilation, and cardiovascular complications such as hypotension, dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction, and neurological complications such as stroke or brain damage. The risks associated wi th biopsies are pain and bleeding at the biopsy site. Rarely, there 
is a risk of infection at the biopsy site. The anesthesia and biopsies of the initial evaluation have the benefit of confirming the diagnosis and the extent of the disease, and permitting debulking of disease that poses a major airway risk. Similarly, the anesthesia and biopsies at the completion of treatment will either confirm a complete response or will be performed in association with papi[INVESTIGATOR_770901].  
12.5.4 Risks associated with blood sampling 
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting.

 12.5.5 Risks associated with leukapheresis  
Risks may involve bleeding at the apheresis site and lightheadedness. Decrease in blood pressure 
is considered a less common risk. 
12.5.6 Risks associated with intravenous catheter 
12.5.7 The risks of IV insertion include temporary pain and bleeding or bruising at the site 
where the IV enters the skin.  In placing the IV, there is a small chance of f luid leaking 
into the tissue surrounding the IV and infection, which may cause some swelling and discomfort. Rarely, the IV site may become infected, which might require treatment with antibiotics. Risks associated with flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy 
Complications are very uncommon; but may include tearing, gagging, coughing, and, less frequently, nose bleeding due to the scope being passed through the nose.

ONSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
The informed consent document will be provided to the participant for review prior to 
consenting.  A designated study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study. 
The initial consent process as well as re -consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms) per discretion of the 
designated study investigator and with the agreement of the participant.  Whether in person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant, when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant will be informed of the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.

 The liquid formulation has the same composition in terms of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], qualitatively and 
quantitatively, except for the addition of water compared with the freeze-dried formulation, 
which was initially used in the ongoing Phase I study (EMR200647-001). Of note, there is no change to the drug substance process. 
For applications in clinical studies, the liquid formulation is diluted directly with 0.9% saline 
solution (sodium chloride injection) supplied in an infusion bag. 
The estimated volumes of delivery are anticipated to be no more than 250 mL, which are 
clinically acceptabl e. Detailed information on infusion preparation and adm inistration are 
provided in the protocol and manual of preparation. 
14.1.1 Mode of Action  
M7824 is a conjugate comprised of avelumab and the soluble extracellular domain of human 
TGF -β receptor II (TGF -βRII). Avelumab  targets the programmed death –ligand 1 (PD -L1). PD-1 
is a negative regulatory receptor expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its ligand, PD-L1, results in the down-regulation of lymphocyte activation. Avelumab  inhibits 
the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1.  Inhibition of the interaction between PD- 1 and PD-L1 promotes 
immune responses and antigen- specific T -cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-
antigens. The “TGF -β trap” portion of the compound sequesters bioavai lable TGF -β from the 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_770904].  
14.1.2 Source 
M7824 is an investigational agent that will be supplied to the NIH Pharmacy by [CONTACT_28734]. 14.1.3 Toxicities  
The important potential risks include hypersensitivity, irAEs/autoimmune disorders, anemia, rash 
with hyperkeratosis/keratoacanthomas/SCC of the skin, embryo- fetal toxicity, and alterations in 
wound healing or repair of tissue damage.  
In addition, after discussion among NCI investigators  on multiple protocols using M7824, 
multiple bleeding events ranging from low grade gingival bleeding and epi[INVESTIGATOR_148332], GI bleeding and hematuria have been observed. Some of these events can be attributed to bleeding events related to cancer directly and others bleeding events can be attributed to colitis or cystitis which is a known toxicity of anti- PD-L1 agents including M7824. 
However, there remains the possibility that M7824 may increase the overall risk of bleeding in ways that may not be directly related to direct tumor bleeding or inflammatory bleeding events described with checkpoint inhibitors like M7824. It is hypothesized that this possible increased bleeding risk may be due to TGF beta inhibition which has an effect on angiogenesis ; bleeding 
has also been observed in patients receiving M7824 and may be drug-related (e.g., gum bleeding, nose bleeds, coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the stool).  Accordingly, patients will b e notified of the same possible risk in the informed consent document for this 
study.

 16.3 APPENDIX C: MANAGEMENT OF IMMUNE -RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
Immune- Related Adverse Events  
Since inhibition of PD- L1 stimulates the immune system, immune -related AEs (irAEs) may 
occur.  Treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent upon severity (NCI- CTCAE grade):  
Grade 1 to 2:  treat symptomatically or with moderate dose steroids, more frequent monitoring 
Grade 1 to 2 (persistent):  manage similar to high grade AE (Grade 3 to 4) Grade 3 to 4:  treat with high dose corticosteroids  16.3.1 Gastrointestinal ir AEs

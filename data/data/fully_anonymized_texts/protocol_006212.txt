 [ADDRESS_1270966] of myHealth Rewards Enrollment Emails ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  Study Protocol with Statistical Analysis Plan  December 7, [ADDRESS_1270967] of different email message conditions (standard promotional email and loss frame) on enrollment in a wellness program (myHealth Rewards) by [CONTACT_523402] (GHP) members who have recently been hired at Geisinger. The current study was developed to test whether the loss frame email was more effective than a standard reminder email, particularly for a population that was new to the organization.  It was hypothesized that the loss frame email would increase enrollment more compared to the standard email.  Methods  Sample  There were 831 new employees who received emails from July 16, 2019 to October 8, 2019. Enrollment data was gathered until December 20, 2019. Of these employees, 7 were excluded for registering before the emails were sent (e.g., after learning about the program during new hire orientation). The final sample consisted of [ADDRESS_1270968] line suggesting that employees were currently "throwing away" a precise dollar amount by [CONTACT_905599] (i.e., savings) by [CONTACT_523405]. This email contained and built upon all of the same information included in the standard email.  Outcome measures  The outcome measure was enrollment in the myHealth Rewards program. This measure was binary, and data was collected until December 20, 2019. Although the number of people who clicked on the link was planned as another primary outcome measure, this data was not collected due to administrative error.     
 3 Statistical Analysis Plan  Binary logistic generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyze enrollment and as a function of experimental condition, with the standard email group as a reference group.  Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); two-tailed p-values < 0.[ADDRESS_1270969] size, the standardized statistic, Cohen’s d, was estimated using the formula 𝐿𝑜𝑔𝑂𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜	×	√3𝜋⁄ (Hasselblad & Hedges, 1995). Raw percentages with 95% CIs were also presented in graphs. All analyses were conducted in R.

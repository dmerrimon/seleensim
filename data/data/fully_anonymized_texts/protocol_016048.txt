1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This is a single center, open label, non -randomized, phase Ib/II trial of HPV16 -E711-19 nanomer 
vaccine  (DPX -E7) for treatment  of incurable  HPV16 -related  oropharyngeal  (HPVOC),  cervical  and 
anal cancer.  
 
Safety and clinical efficacy of the DPX -E7 vaccine will be evaluated in up to n=44 patients 
(Considering that patients continue to be screened and at least n=[ADDRESS_833688] been entered and 
began protocol treatment at the original dose prior to approval o f Amendment 10, and allowing for 
1 or 2 patients to sign the main consent and to be registered to the main protocol but not begin 
protocol  treatment  or be ineligible,  the overall  accrual  goal following  approval  of Amendment  10 is 
up to n=44).  
 
The new treatment  regimen  (amendment  10) changed  the treatment  regimen,  removing  Cytoxan  and 
doubling the vaccine dose. For patients enrolled on the trial before amendment 10’s approval, they 
will continue to dose with Cytoxan and the original vaccine doses (0.25mL for priming, 0.1mL for 
boosting)  
 
Potentially  eligible  patients  with confirmed  diagnosis  of incurable  oropharyngeal,  cervical  or anal 
cancer will be asked to sign a pre -screening consent that will allow us to use a blood sample for 
HLA testing.  
 
HLA -A*[ADDRESS_833689] 6 
patients who sign the main consent and begin protocol treatment at the new dose (of note, there  
have  been  no DLTs  observed  among  the first [ADDRESS_833690]  been  treated at  the dose originally 
outlined in the protocol)  
 
As this is the first study testing the DPX -E7 vaccine in humans, the following monitoring will be 
used: The enrollment of first six subjects who begin protocol treatment will be concurrent and they 
will be observed for adverse events. If zero or one DLT (s ee section 6.2 for definition) is observed 
through  the first month  after the second  priming  dose in the first six subjects,  then study  enrollment 
into the first stage (n=16) will continue and may continue concurrently. If there are two DLT’s 
observed throu gh the first month after the second priming dose in the first six subjects, the dose of 
DPX -E7 vaccine  will be de-escalated.  If there  are [ADDRESS_833691] stage (n=16) will continue. If there are two or more 
DLTs OR one death OR two grade [ADDRESS_833692] month after the second 
priming  dose in these  six subjects,  then accrual  will be suspended  to further  evaluate  the events  and 
decisions  made  regarding the  overall  status  of the trial. Only  those  patients  treated at  the acceptable 
dose will be included in the phase II portion of the trial. Adverse events will be continuously

As overall  monthly  accrual  is estimated  to be 6 pre-consented  for HLA  and HPV  testing,  with 33% 
of those HLA -A*[ADDRESS_833693] and/or their immune response is not being maintained.  
 
DLT  assessment  period  will last until day 50 (28 days after the second  priming  dose).  Vaccine  dose 
reduction wou ld occur in the event of 2 DLTs. If a dose reduction is required then the new dose 
level will be 0.2 mL for the priming doses while the boosting doses will remain at 0.2 mL.

six subjects, the dose of DPX -E7 vaccine will be de -escalated.  
a Patients  enrolled  prior  to amendment  10’s approval  will receive  priming  and boosting  doses  of 
0.25mL and 0.1mL, respectively.  
Cyclophosphamide  dose  reduction  in Phase  Ib/IIa 
 
Modified  Dose*  50 mg once  per day 
Planned  Dose  50 mg twice  per day 
* Cyclophosphamide dose can be reduced to 50 mg once per day. If ANC ≤ 1,000/uL or Platelet ≤ 
100,000/ uL, then the cyclosphosphamide will be held. In order to restart administration of 
cyclophosphamide,  the platelet  and ANC  levels  should  have  resolved  to ≤ Grade  1 or to the patient’s 
baseline value. The maximum delay before treatment should be discontinued is 3 weeks. Once the 
cyclophosphamide  is restarted, it can  be dose reduced  to 50mg per day per investigator’s  discretion. 
If the cyclophosphamide dose has  been reduced, it can’t be re -escalated.  
a Only  for patients  enrolled before  amendment  10’s approval.  
 
Visits for pre -screening, screening, treatment, safety evaluation and assessment of tumor response 
will occur as outlined in section 10.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study  Disease  
 
Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_625729] (HPV) are double -stranded DNA viruses that infect epi[INVESTIGATOR_625730]1. Of the more than [ADDRESS_833696], infecting the anogenital region and oropharynx. Among th ese, approximately 15 are 
designated  “high -risk”  (i.e. oncogenic)  and have  been  linked  to cervical  cancer  as well as anal,  vulva, 
vaginal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers2. Worldwide, >5% of all new cancers are attributable to 
high-risk HPV infections3. HPV is the cause of virtually all cases of cervical cancer, the second 
leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide4-6. While the implementation of screening 
has greatly  reduced  the burden  of this disease  in the developed  world,  treatment  options  for persistent, 
recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer remain limited and the prognosis is poor7,8. 
 
Anal cancer  accounted for  7060 cases per  year estimated for the  U.S. in 2013 and are closely linked 
to HPV infection. A recent analysis of 96 patients fro m Montreal showed that 92% had detectable 
HPV  and HPV  [ADDRESS_833697]  common  subtype  at 90%,  with multiple  other  subtypes  seen in 
small  numbers9. An earlier  study,  limited  to men from  the San Francisco  area,  found  that in the setting 
of HIV infection 93% of anal cancer patients had evidence of HPV, whereas the rate of HPV 
involvement was 61%  among HIV -negative  men10. A large  population -based study in Denmark and 
Sweden detected HPV in 84% of patients with anal cancer11. 
 
Overal l, patients  with anal cancer  do quite  well with the standard  treatment  of pelvic  radiation  given 
concurrently with two cycles of 5FU and mitomycin C12. While most patients with this disease can 
be cured, [ADDRESS_833698] line chemotherapy,  often  cisplatin  and 5FU,  can be 
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, [ADDRESS_833699] line chemotherapy are  an appropriate  group 
for testing the current vaccine.  
 
HPV  associated  oropharyngeal  cancer  (HPVOC)  is an emerging  epi[INVESTIGATOR_625731] 10 000 
new cases per year in the US alone and the incidence is projected to double every 5 -10 years in the 
coming decades. While HPVOC responds well to treatment and is curable in the vas t majority of 
patients  when  detected  early,  approximately  10% of patients  will be diagnosed  with or will eventually 
develop incurable disease and eventually die of their disease14-16. Metastatic HPVOC responds 
frequently to first line chemotherapy which ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_625732].  
 
The viral E6 and E7 encoded  proteins  have  transforming  activities  through  functional  inactivation  of 
the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, respectively17-20. Not surprisingly, 
therefore, abrogation of activities of E6 and/or E7 experimentally terminates the malignant state of 
HPV -transformed cells in vitro21. 
 
A key advance  in combating  HPV  infection  and its causally  related  diseases  has been  based  on virus - 
like particle prophylactic vaccine development22. This vaccine consists of recombinant HPV L1 
capsid  protein  that self-assembles  to create  virus -like particles  against  which  protective,  high-titered 
anti-L1 neutralizing antibodies are elicited in vivo22,23. In both females and males, such vaccines 
comprising 2 high risk capsids effectively prevent development of anogenital diseases24. However, 
capsid -based therapeutic HPV vaccine strategies cannot be employed once infection/disease is 
established  for at least two reasons.  First,  humoral  protection  is associated  with antibody  binding  to 
the capsid L1 protein thereby [CONTACT_625779]. The L1 protein is exclusively 
expressed  late in the HPV  replication  cycle  and only in differentiated  keratin ocytes  within  the upper 
layers of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_625733]. Persistent infection in the host is maintained by 
[CONTACT_625780]25. As humoral immune responses 
against  capsid  proteins  do not affect persistently  infected  basal  cells,  they are consequently  unable  to 
clear infection24,26. Second, high risk HPV -associated cancers arise with genomic integration of E6 
and E7 viral oncogenes. Although L1 and L2 genes may also be integrated and capsid proteins 
expressed27 these are intracellular and hence, antibody inaccessible.  
 
During natural infection, HPV is cleared by [CONTACT_625781].  A 
few percent  of persistent  infections  evolve  into neoplasias  that may progress  to malignancy  with high 
risk HPV types28. Although immune suppression is associated with chroni c infection, most patients 
with persistent HPV infections do not show immune deficiencies in response to other pathogens29. 
Persistent infection with malignant or premalignant lesions is often associated with HPV -specific T 
cells whose significance for ant i-tumor immunity is not always clear. For example, one study that 
detected HPV -responding T cells in peripheral blood of patients with high grade cervical 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_315801]  (CIN2/3)  was unable  to correlate  IFN-γ levels  or antigen  specificity  of T cell 
response with the 26% of the patients that showed spontaneous lesion regression30. Whereas the 
presence of circulating HPV -specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) did not correlate with 
disease prognosis in early stage cervical cancer, the degree of CD8+ tumor infiltration and balance 
(ratio) of CD8+ T cells to regulatory T cells w ere correlated31,32. Consistent with a critical role of 
inflammatory  signals  in inducing  T cell responses,  vulval  intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_625734]- 
like receptor  7 activator  Imiquimod  showed  regression  and viral clearance  in association  with 
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
10  
 circulating  HPV -specific  T cells33,34. Recently,  vaccination  with synthetic  long peptides  covering  the 
E6 and E7 oncoproteins  plus conventional  adjuvant  treatment  was reported  to clear  HPV -16 induced 
high-grade vulva intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_625735] ~50% of patients35. 
 
While it is widely acknowledged that antitumor cellular immunity is influenced by [CONTACT_625782], tumor microenvironment and tumor escape mechanisms36, the nature of  T cell antigen 
specificity is less defined despi[INVESTIGATOR_625736]. Ex vivo T cell assays that mark HPV -specificity 
identify a broad priming display by [CONTACT_109961] (pAPCs) but do not 
interrogate antitumor CTL activity nor do th ey identify the breadth of HPV -specific MHC I display 
of the tumor per se37. Pointedly, in the context of a narrow tumor display, antitumor vaccines that 
prime  a broad  T cell response  generate  a small  fraction  of tumor  lytic CD8+  T cells,  resulting  in low 
densities of useful tumor infiltrating T cells.  
 
2.2 DepoVaxTM Technology  
 
Immunovaccine has developed a patented prophylactic/therapeutic vaccine delivery and 
enhancement platform called DepoVaxTM. DepoVax (DPX) is a lipid -based depot formulation able 
to enhance  immune  responses  towards  peptide  antigens.  DepoVax  has been  demonst rated  to enhance 
peptide  immunogenicity in animal models and to maintain an immune  response  to the  antigens after 
repeated immunizations38,39. The platform also includes a synthetic adjuvant to enhance and sustain 
the immune response.  
 
DepoVax formulations  are flexible compositions that can be modified for specific indications by 
[CONTACT_625783].  The formulations consists of:  (1) lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (2) an adjuvant, (3) 
specific  antigen(s),  and (4) a hydrophobic  carrier.  DepoVax  formulations  are oil based,  which  allows 
for practical  delivery  of peptide  antigens  without  having  to resort  to cumbersome  emulsification.  The 
unique  combination  of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_625737] a hydrophobic  carrier  such as mineral  oil creates  a very strong  depot 
at the site of immunization,  co-delivering and holding antigens and the adjuvant at the site for a 
prolonged period of time.  Immunovaccine’s hypothesis is that the immune enhancement properties 
of this unique formulation are a result of this co -delivery and depot effect.  
 
DepoVax has  been used as the basis for two therapeutic cancer vaccines currently under clinical 
development, DPX -0907 and DPX -Survivac, in the US and Canada.  Immunovaccine’s first 
immunotherapeutic  vaccine,  known  as DPX -0907,  is a candidate  anti-cancer  vaccine  for the treatment 
of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.  DPX -0907 vaccine consists of 7 tumor -specific human 
leukocyte  antigen  (HLA -A*02)  restricted  peptides,  a universal  T helper  epi[INVESTIGATOR_625738], 
a synthetic polynucleotide adjuvant, and phospholi pi[INVESTIGATOR_136982]. In [ADDRESS_833700] -in-human Phase 1 clinical study (protocol ONC -DPX -0907 -01) in the US which 
demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine.  These findings were published in the 
Journal of Translational Me dicine40. 
 
Immunovaccine is currently conducting, with its second immunotherapeutic vaccine candidate, a 
Phase 1b clinical trial (DPX -ONC -DPX -Survivac -03) in ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], and peritoneal 
cancer patients in centers in both the US and Canada and a  Phase 2 trial (ONC -PX-Survivac -05) in 
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients  in Canada; subjects in both trials receive up to six 
doses  of vaccine  along  with low dose cyclophosphamide  (50 mg bid). DPX -Survivac  is a therapeutic 
cancer vaccine conta ining one decapeptide and four nonapeptides with different HLA restrictions, a 
universal  T helper  epi[INVESTIGATOR_625739],  a synthetic  polynucleotide  adjuvant,  and

Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
11  
  
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_625740].  DPX -Survivac  is designed  to target  survivin,  a member  of the inhibitor 
of apoptosis protein (IAP) family.  A first -in-human Phase 1 trial was completed in 2013 (protocol 
ONC -DPX -Survivac -01). The Phase [ADDRESS_833701] been published in Oncoimmunology41. 
 
2.3 IND Agent:  DPX -E7 Vaccine  
 
Rece ntly, an E711-19 nanomer  peptide  as a dominant  T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_625741] -A*02:[ADDRESS_833702] to therapeutic vaccination strategies targeting disease specific 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_625742].  Similar  clinical  trials  use metronomic,  low dose oral 
cyclophosphamide to deplete regulatory T cells (Treg) and to enhance immunogenicity further.  
 
In this trial, we will use the E7 11-19 nanomer as target for CTL vaccination of HLA -A*02patients, 
given that HPVOC and anal squamous cell cancer are epi[INVESTIGATOR_625743]. DPX -E7 is formulated with the same DepoVax platform technology as Immunovaccine’s 
previous products DPX -[ADDRESS_833703] even  seen immunologic depletion  after treatment with  cyclophosphamide. 
These disappointing results prompted us to eliminate cyclophosphamide from the treatment  
regimen and double the vaccine dose. Including the cohort previously treated with low dose 
metronomic cycl ophosphamide, a total of up to n=44 patients will receive the vaccine (Considering 
that patients continue  to be screened and at least n=[ADDRESS_833704]  been entered and began protocol 
treatment at the original dose prior to approval of Amendment 10, and al lowing for 1 or 2 patients 
to sign the main consent and be registered to the main protocol but not begin protocol treatment or 
be ineligible,  the overall  accrual  goal following  approval  of Amendment  10 is up to n=44)..  Patients 
on the previous treatment re gimen (0.25mL priming doses, 0.1mL booster doses, and metronomic 
cyclophosphamide (50mg BID, 7 days on, 7 days off) will continue to receive this treatment 
regimen. This will allow us to obtain information about safety of the approach and to gain 
prelimina ry insight into clinical efficacy of this strategy. Patients will undergo mandatory tumor 
biopsies  to obtain  fresh  tumor  tissue  prior  and also post vaccination (prior  to first vaccination  and at 
13 (+/ -1) weeks after the first injection).  
 
The tissue  will be  used to  confirm HPV16 -E711-19 peptide  display  by [INVESTIGATOR_46427]. 
 
Once  established, DPX -E7 vaccination  could  become  an attractive  option for  the adjuvant  treatment 
of patients  with persistent  HPV  infection  who are cured  of HPVOC  as well as for healthy  individu als 
with high risk HPV infection such as patient’s spouses, who are at risk to develop oropharyngeal, 
cervical or anal cancer over time.

4.2 General  Guidelines  for DFCI  Registration  Process  
 
HLA -A*02 positive patients (through pre -screening) who also meet all eligibility criteria (through 
screening) will be registered in OnCore by [CONTACT_3476]. Registration must occur prior to the 
initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not registere d to the protocol before protocol therapy 
begins will be considered ineligible.  
 
The investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol therapy. Issues that would cause treatment 
delays should b e discussed with the Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive 
protocol  therapy  within  14 days following  registration,  the participant’s  registration  on the study  must 
be canceled.  
 
The following  source  documents  are required  for regis tering  the patient  in OnCore:  
 
• Copy  of screening  lab results  
• Signed  participant  consent  form 
• Eligibility  Checklist  
 
4.3 Recruitment  Process  
 
Subjects will be recruited from the patient populations of the DFCI Head and Neck Oncology 
Program, the DFCI Gynecologic Oncology Program, and the DFCI Gastrointestinal Oncology 
Program,  through  our clinical  referral  network  and by [CONTACT_625789],  including  the 
Dana -Farber/Partners CancerCare website, www.cancercare.harvard.edu , websites (e.g., 
www.headneckcancer.net ), and the National Cancer Institute ’s clinical trials website, 
www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials . 
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Treatment  Regimen  
 
This is a single center, open label, non -randomized, phase Ib/II trial of HPV16 -E711-19 nanomer 
vaccine  DPX -E7 in treatment  of HLA -A*[ADDRESS_833714] or are no longer effective.  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
15  
  
 
Up to n=44  patients  will be treated  (n= 7 to 10 at the original  dose prior  to approval  of Amendment 
10 and n=33 at the dose outlined in Amendment 10) . and we antic ipate that this will require HLA 
screening at least 100 patients following approval of Amendment 10.  
 
HLA -A*[ADDRESS_833715] and/or their immune response is not being 
maintained. Because the correlation between the induration and the immune endpoint is still being 
investigated,  immune  respo nses in addition  to the induration  will be collected  to better  establish  this 
potential efficacy parameter.  
 
Former  Treatment  Regimen  
 
Patients enrolled on the previous treatment regimen (0.25mL priming doses, 0.1mL booster doses, 
and 50mg  cyclophosphamide  BID for 7 days on, 7 days off) will continue  this regimen  until treatment 
discontinuation.  Injection  visits  will remain  the same  (D1, D22, etc.),  but cyclophosphamide  will be 
taken starting one week prior to the first injection visit.  
 
Low dose metronomic  oral cyclophosphamide  (50 mg twice  per day) will start [ADDRESS_833716] 
vaccination, continue for 7 days on and then 7 days off, throughout the treatment period, until 
progression. Cyclophosphamide dose can be reduced to 50 mg, once a day. If ANC ≤ 1,000/uL or 
Platelet  ≤ 100,000/  uL, then the cyclosphosphamide  will be held. In order  to restart  administration  of 
cyclophosphamide,  the platelet  and ANC  levels  should  have  resolved  to ≤ Grade  1 or to the patient’s 
baseline value. The maximum delay before treatment should be discontinued is 3 weeks. Once the 
cyclophosphamide  is restarted, it can be  dose reduced to 50mg per day per investigator’s  discretion.  
 
Cylophosphamide  should  be taken  with or immediately  after meal.  Cylophosphamide  capsule  should 
be swallowed whole, with a large glass of water. It should not be crushed or chewed. Missed or 
vomited  doses  of cylophosphamide  should  not be retaken  to make  up for the lost dose.  Patient  should 
complete the diary on a daily basis and bring it to th e clinic at each visit. Missed or vomited doses 
should be recorded on the diary.  
 
Visits for screening, treatment, safety evaluation and assessment of tumor response will occur as 
outlined in section 10.  
 
5.2 Agent  Administration  
 
The vaccine will be injected deep subcutaneously using the guidelines below, on days 1 and 22 (+/ - 
2) days,  to allow  for holidays  or problems  with transportation).  The patient  will be observed  for acute 
hypersensitivity reactions on the nursing floor for one hour following the injection.  Following the 
first two doses of vaccine, booster doses of vaccine will be administered every 8 weeks (+/ -2 days), 
until progression.  
 
All preparations of the recon stituted vaccine will be performed at room temperature on the day of 
immunization.  Subjects will  receive  two 0.50mL  or 0.25 mL priming  three  weeks apart  followed  by 
0.2 or 0.1 mL boosting  doses  of DPX -Survivac  every  eight  weeks,  in alternating  upper  thigh  regions.  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, [ADDRESS_833717] injection then cooling of the 
injection site with ice packs 15 minutes prior to subsequent immunization is permitted.  
 
It is very important  to follow  the administration  instructions  below  to avoid  exaggerated  injection  site 
reactions:  
1. Inject  the vaccine  in the front  and/or  outer  upper  half of the thigh  region  closer  to the inguinal 
lymph nodes so the vaccine can be processed by [CONTACT_27639].  
2. Inject the vaccine deep subcutaneously and NOT intracutaneously.  The full length of the 
needle must be inserted and at the correct angle (45 -90 degrees) based on the size of the 
subject’s upper thigh region.  
3. Whether or not an injection site reaction is present, vaccine should be administered 
approximately 10 cm to prior  injection sites and the location of each injection should be 
recorded in the source documents.  
4. The sponsor may be present on vaccinations days and/or a video may be provided to assist 
with the injection technique.  
5. It is recommended  that the same  trained  study staff inject  all subjects  at their sites.  
 
If a subject experiences any grade 2 or greater injection site reaction(s) or any grade injection site 
ulceration  within  [ADDRESS_833718] and/or their immune response is not being 
maintained.  
 
5.3 General  Concomitant  Medication  and Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
 
Possible immediate side effects from vaccine injections, including DPX -E7, m ay include allergic 
reactions such as fever, hives, or rash.  For fever >101.5 oF (>39 oC), acetaminophen (650 mg) may 
be given  orally.  The induction  of autoimmunity  (manifests  as arthritis,  serositis,  nephritis,  thyroiditis, 
colitis, neutropenia, etc.) is theoretically possible.  Acute allergic reactions may be treated with 
diphenhydramine,  and/or  epi[INVESTIGATOR_625747].  Delayed  events  such as rash or hives  maybe  treated 
with diphenhydramine  (25-50 mg);  topi[INVESTIGATOR_625748]’s principle investigator.  
 
To care for possible  infected  injection  site reactions  proper  wound  care is appropriate.  Infected  areas 
should  be kept clean  and exposed.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_625749]. 
Cultures should be sent for infections and treated promptly with oral antibiotics. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_191964] (hydrocortisone ointment) may be used to help reduce inflammation.  
 
Possible  side effects  from  Montanide  ISA 51 VG are granuloma,  abscess,  and fever.  Acetaminophen 
650 mg every 4 hours may be given for fever after appropriate blood cultures are  taken.  Referral to 
a surgeon is encouraged for abscess.  
 
Cyclophosphamide  (only  for patients  on former  treatment regimen)  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
17  
  
Low dose metronomic  oral cyclophosphamide  (50 mg twice  per day) will start [ADDRESS_833719] 
vaccination, continue for 7 days on and then 7 days off, throughout the treatment period. 
Cyclophosphamide dose can be reduced to 50 mg, once per day. If ANC ≤ 1,000/uL or Platelet ≤ 
100,000/ uL, then the cyclosphosphamide will be held. In order to restart administration of 
cyclophosphamide,  the platelet  and ANC  levels  should  have  resolved  to ≤ Grade  1 or to the patient’s 
baseline value . The maximum delay before treatment should be discontinued is 3 weeks. Once the 
cyclophosphamide  is restarted,  it can  be dose reduced  to 50mg per day per investigator’s  discretion. 
If the cyclophosphamide dose has been reduced, it can’t be re -escalated.. Cyclophosphamide will 
continue until clinical progression occurs.  
 
Possible  side effects  from  low doses cyclophosphamide  are grade  1 nausea  and/or  vomiting,  grade 1 
and 2  anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and lymphopenia as well as low -grade fatigue.  If platelet 
levels decrease below 100,000/ L or if absolute neutrophil count decreases below 1000/ L in any 
cycle then the dose of cyclophosphamide can be reduced to [ADDRESS_833720]’s cyclophosphamide could 
be further modified by [CONTACT_625790].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_833721] scan 4 weeks later.  
 
Continuation  of treatment  with  booster  doses  of vaccine  after clinical  progression:  
If there are no other tre atment options available, at the discretion of the PI, participants may 
continue  receiving  treatment  with booster  doses  of vaccine after  clinical  progression.  Treatment 
may continue until RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_833722] outcome, if 
possible . 
 
Participants  should  also be  removed from protocol  therapy if  any of the following occurs:  
 
• Unacceptable adverse  event(s),  including  a DLT  
• Participant  demonstrates  an inability  or unwillingness  to comply  
• Participant  decides  to withdraw  from  the protocol  therapy  
• General  or specific  changes in the participant's  condition  render  the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
• Intercurrent  illness  that prevents  further  administration  of treatment  and/or  would  affect 
the assessment of the subject’s clinical status to a significant degree  
• Pregnancy  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, [ADDRESS_833723]  be documented  in 
the case report form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
 
Information  will be entered  in OnCore  when  a participant  is removed  from protocol therapy.  
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, treating investigators must immediately 
notify the PI, Karthik Sehgal, MD at [ADDRESS_833724].  
 
5.6 Criteria for  Taking  a Participant  off Study  
 
If progression is documented (except new lesions) on restaging scans patients may remain on study 
and be followed at the discretio n of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_625750] (see study calendar). In these 
cases,  follow  up scans  will be obtained  [ADDRESS_833725] PD.  
 
Because swelling and inflammation at the site of tumor may follow vaccination, increased size of 
already  existing  tumor found  on clinical  exam  up to week  7, will not be considered  PD (i.e. possible 
pseudo -progression). If, however, new sites of disease are found, the subjects will be considered to 
have PD.  
 
Participants  will be removed  from  study when  any of the following  criteria  apply:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal  of consent  for data submi ssion  
• Death  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 
Information  will be entered  in OnCore  when  a participant comes  off study.  
 
5.6.1 Treatment  Beyond  Disease  Prog ression  
 
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may deri ve 
clinical benefit despi[INVESTIGATOR_482491] (PD).  
 
Subjects will be permitted to continue on study treatment for treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 
defined PD as long as they meet the following criteria:  
 
• Investigator -assessed  clinical  benefit  and no rapid disease  progression  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
19  
  
 
• Tolerance  of study drug  
 
• Stable  performance  status  
 
• Treatment  beyond  progression  will not delay  an imminent  intervention  to prevent  serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)  
 
• Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional study treatment, 
using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks o r discomforts, or other 
alternative treatment options. The decision to continue treatment beyond initial 
investigator -assessed progression should be discussed with the investigator and 
documented in the study records.  
 
If the investigator feels that the su bject continues to achieve clinical benefit by [CONTACT_166862],  the subject  should  remain  on the trial and continue  to receive  monitoring  according  to 
the Study Calendar (section 10).  
 
For the subjects  who continue  study  therapy  beyond  progression,  further  progression  is defined  as an 
additional  10% increase  in tumor  burden  from  time of initial  PD. This includes  an increase  in the sum 
of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the 
time of initial PD. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon documentation of 
further progression.  
 
New  lesions are considered measurable at the  time of initial progression if the  longest diameter is at 
least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). 
Any new lesion  considered  non-measurable  at the time of initial  progression  may become  measur able 
and therefore  included  in the tumor  burden  if the longest  diameter  increases  to at least 10 mm (except 
for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm).  
 
In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion of 
new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstr ate an absolute increase of 
at least 5 mm.  
 
6. ANTICIPATED  TOXICITIES  
 
It is anticipated  that there  will be no significant  toxicity  associated  with vaccination  other  than redness 
and discomfort at the injection site. Please refer to section 6.1 for an overvie w of the expected 
toxicities and the current Investigator’s Brochure for details. Subjects will be monitored during the 
injections  and in the immediate  post-injection  period  for fevers  and other  signs  of immune  activation. 
Any evidence of reactions will be recorded. Reactions will be treated as clinically appropriate.  
 
All toxicities occurring from the time of consent to within [ADDRESS_833726] in  human  study  for the  DPX -E7 vacc ine so we do  not know  everything  that possibly

low blood counts)  
 
* Grade 3 injection site reaction as per NCI CTC v.4.03 is defined as ulceration or necrosis; severe 
tissue damage, operative intervention indicated. As we are increasing the dose, AEs may be more 
frequent.  
Some  participants  may experience  one or more  of the above  side effects  from  DPX -E7. Most  of the 
side effects do not have the potential of being permanent. It is not yet known how long effects like 
hardness, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring from an ulceration may persist. It is possible that an 
injection si te reaction may not occur until after treatment or may re -occur after you have stopped 
receiving study treatment. The side effects for DPX -E7 listed as rare are theoretically possible but 
have not been seen in any of the human participants receiving the si milar DPX vaccines.  
 
6.2 Definition of a  Dose  Limiting Toxicity  
 
Toxicity  will be assessed  using  the NCI  Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for Adverse  Events, version  
4.03 http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf  
A dose limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  is defined  in this study  as any grade  [ADDRESS_833728] 
possibly related to the study agent including injection site reactions; or grade [ADDRESS_833729]  prior  to day 50 (monitoring  for DLT  to be continued  up to 1 month 
(28 days)  after the second  priming dose),  will trigger  a DLT.  In addition,  to be considered  a DLT  in 
this study the adverse event must be considered at least possibly related to study treatment.  At the 
investigator’s  discretion,  grade  3 or greater  abnormal  lab values  lasting < 72 hours  may be excluded 
as DLTs if there are no accompanying clinical signs or symptoms.  
 
Vaccine dose reduction would occur in the event of 2 DLTs. If a dose reduction is required then the 
new dose level  will be 0.2 or 0.1 mL for the priming  doses  while  the boosting  doses  will remain  at 
0.2 or 0.1 mL (depending  on treatment  regimen).

7. ADVERSE EVENTS LIST  AND  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
7.1 Definition  of an Adverse  Event  
 
The following definition of  an AE  will be  used for this study:  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled subject who was administered the clinical trial 
material; the occurrence does not have to have a causal relations hip with treatment to be considered 
an AE.  
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the investigational 
product, whether or not it is considered to be related to the investigational product.  
 
AEs may include  pre- or post-treatment  events  that occur  as a result  of protocol  mandated  procedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of the subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_833730] should also be reported to the 
study sponsor.  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
22  
  
 
All AEs will be  followed until: resolution, the  condition stabilizes, the  event is otherwise  explained, 
or the subject is lost to follow -up. However, once the subject is on new treatment no pre -existing 
AEs should be followed and no new AEs reported.  
 
7.3 Definition  of a Serious  Adverse  Event  
 
The definition of  a SAE  is an AE that meets any of the  following  criteria:  
 
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62002] a prolongation  of an existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (for reason(s) 
other than scheduled tumor biopsy)  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly  or birth defect  
• Other  important  medical  event  that may jeopardize  the subject  or may require  medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Any events or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_625751].  In many cases only the symptoms of the disease progression will be listed as 
AEs.  
 
A SAE  requires  additional  detailed  reports  and follow -up. The content  of these  detailed  reports  must 
address the PI’s estimate of causality.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_625752] 
(whether or not the AE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the IB).  
 
7.[ADDRESS_833731] will be ques tioned about AEs at 
each clinic visit.  The question asked will be: “ Since your last clinic visit or since you began taking 
the investigational medication, have you had any health problems?” All clinical complaints 
volunteered  by [CONTACT_625792].  
 
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120876],  laboratory,  and diagnostic  reports)  relative  to the event(s).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_625753] (including  SAEs)  on the AE form  of the eCRF  and 
for SAEs, must also enter on an SAE Report Form.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_625754] a diagnosis of the event based on the signs, symptoms, or other 
clinical  information.  In such cases,  the diagnosis, not  the individual  signs  and symptoms,  should  be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF as the AE or SAE.  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, [ADDRESS_833732]  labeling  information  for marketed  products,  in the determination  of the assessment.  
 
There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_625755].  However,  it is very  important that the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_625756].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_625757] -up information, amending the SAE report. The causality assessm ent 
is one of the criteria  used to determine  regulatory  reporting  requirements  and should  not be left blank.

8.1.6 Administration  
 
All subjects  will be treated  in an outpatient  unit equipped  with emergency equipment.  Subjects  will 
be monitored with blood pressure, pulse, and te mperature assessments at pre -injection, and at 
approximately (i.e. within 5 minutes) [ADDRESS_833737]  a code  cart available  for emergency  use. If hypotension  (systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg for subjects with a baseline SBP >110 mmHg or >20 mmHg 
decrease for those with a baseline SBP <110 mmHg), urticaria, orofacial or laryngeal edema, or 
bronchospasm  occur,  an intravenous  catheter  will be placed  and the diphendydramine  and solumedrol 
will be administered.   The physician  in charge  will be notified  and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_625761]  #: 15-578

hypotension.  
 
The vaccine will be injected deep su bcutaneously, using the guidelines provided in section 5.2, on 
days 1 and 22 (+/ -2) to allow for holidays or problems with transportation). The patient will be 
observed  for acute  hypersensitivity  reactions  on the nursing  floor  for one hour following  the injection. 
Following  the first two doses  of vaccine,  booster  doses  of vaccine  will be administered  every  8 weeks 
(+/-2 days), until progression. For patients continuing the former treatment regimen, every effort 
should be  made  to ensure a  full [ADDRESS_833739]’s flow cytometry resul ts were considered positive if the measurement is greater than the 
standard  level  of sensitivity  (approximately  > 0.05%  positive  cells)  and the post treatment  value  is at 
least two times greater than the pre -treatment value.

10.1 Contraindicated  Medications  
 
Subjects  should  be taken  off trial if they initate  any chemotherapeutic  agents,  systemic  corticosteroids 
or other immunosuppressives, or other immunotherapy while enrolled on study. Medications that 
result in immunosuppression should also be avoided while on study unless medically necessary due 
to unforeseen circumstances. Examples include sys temically absorbed corticosteroids, NSAIDs and 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  No adjuvanted  vaccine  or live attenuated  vaccine  (such  as Flumist)  should  be given  while  on 
this study.  Non-adjuvanted vaccines (such as most influenza vaccines) can be given.  For subjects 
receiving t he flu vaccine, Immunovaccine strongly recommends the shot be given at least one week 
before immunological assessments.  
 
11. MEASUREMENT  OF EFFECT  
 
Measurable  disease  will be defined,  according  to modified  RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_833758] (Appendix B & C). If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology, if clinically feasible.  
 
Measurable lesions will b e defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension  with the longest  diameter  2.[ADDRESS_833759]  be 1.[ADDRESS_833760] one dimension.  If no other  measurable  lesions  can be found  outside 
of a previously irradiated field, (i.e. as may be seen with locoregional recurrence), and the lesion in 
the irradiated area meets all other conditions for being measurable, and the lesion is new or has 
increased  in size by [CONTACT_2669] 20% in longest  diameter,  taking  as reference  the smallest  longest  diameter 
since radiation, and the previous radiation was completed at least 6 months prior to registration, it 
can be chosen. Non -measurable lesions include all other lesions, such as small lesions  (longest 
diameter  <2.0 cm with conventional  techniques  or <1.[ADDRESS_833761] scans)  bone  lesions  without 
significant extraosseous component, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, 
abdominal masses that are not confirmed and fol lowed by [CONTACT_15218], and cystic lesions.  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
36  
  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules, 
palpable  lymph  nodes).  For the case of skin lesions,  documentation  by [CONTACT_625802] 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
 
As outlined  above,  all subjects  will be evaluated  for response  to vaccination  by [CONTACT_33162], 
and CT scans  of the known  disease.  CT scans  (and/or  MRI,  if applicable)  of the neck,  chest  or pelvis 
will be used to follow local recurrence or intrathoracic metastasis. Subjects with known abdominal 
or pelvic metastasis will also have ct scans (or MRI, if applicable). Radiographic response is 
determined as per modified RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_833762] at 1 2 weeks. A confirmatory scan may be 
performed for subjects with response no earlier than 4 weeks from the documented response. 
Restaging studies will continue, as noted above. If progression is documented (except new lesions) 
on scans at [ADDRESS_833763]  diameter  (LD)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported 
as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the 
objective  tumor  response for  determination of  ORR. Evaluation of  target and non -target lesions will 
be performed and response  determined according to  RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_833764] (Appendix B & C).  
 
 
12. DATA  REPORTING /  REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS  
 
The QACT  will collect,  manage,  and perform  quality  checks  on the data for this study.  Adverse  event 
lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Sections 6 and 7.  
 
12.1 Data  Safety  Monitoring  
 
The DF/HCC  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  will review  and monitor  toxicity  and 
accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with experience in 
oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises any questions 
about participant safety will be addressed with the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  
 
The DSMC  will review  each protocol  at least once  or up to four times  a year or more  often  if required 
to review  toxicity  and accrual  data.  Information  to be provided  to the committee  may include:  up-to- 
date participant accrual; current dose level information; all grade [ADDRESS_833765]  been  reported;  summary  of all deaths  occurring  with 30 days of intervention;  audit

results;  and a summary  will be provided by [CONTACT_2362].  Other  information  (e.g. scans,  laboratory 
values) will be provided upon request.  
 
13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Following approval of Amendment 10, the below stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_625764] 6 
patients who sign the main consent and begin protocol treatment at the new dose (of note, there 
have  been  no DLTs  observed  among  the first [ADDRESS_833766]  been  treated  at the dose originally 
outlined in the protocol).  
 
As this is the first study testing the DPX -E7 vaccine in humans, the following monitoring will be 
used: If zero or one DLT (see section 6.2 for definition) is observed through the first month  after 
the second priming dose in the first six subjects who begin protocol treatment, then study 
enrollment into the first stage (n=16) will continue.  If there are two DLT’s observed through the 
first month after the second priming dose in the first six s ubjects, the dose of DPX -E7 vaccine will 
be de -escalated. If there are [ADDRESS_833767] stage (n=16) will continue.  If there are two or more DLTs OR one death 
OR two grade [ADDRESS_833768] month after the second priming dose in these six 
subjects,  then accrual  will be suspended  to further  evaluate  the events  and decisions  made  regarding 
the overall status of the trial. Only those patients treated at the acceptable dose will be included in 
the phase II  portion of the trial. Adverse events will be continuously monitored throughout the trial 
by [CONTACT_625803]: the study status 
and patient entry throughout the duration of the trial.  
 
As overall  monthly  accrual  is estimated  to be 6 pre-consented  for HLA  and HPV  testing,  with 33% 
of those HLA -A*[ADDRESS_833769] 6 patients who begin protocol treatment, 
however, these estimates will be monitored and accrual will be suspended as needed.  
 
One of the primary objectives of this trial is to evaluate changes in CD8+ T cells in the peripheral 
blood  and tumor  tissue  in patients  positive  for HLA -A*02  with advanced  incurable  HPVOC,  cervical  
, or anal cancer.  ‘Responders’  will be  defined as patients with at least a  two-fold increase  in number 
of CD8+  T cells (dextramer,  ELISpot  or both methods)  in the peripheral  blood  and tissue  at the final 
analysis.  In ONC -DPX -Survivac -[ADDRESS_833770]’s  flow cytometry  results  were  considered  positive  if the measurement  is greater  than 
the standard level of sensitivity (approximately > 0.05% positive cells) and the post treatment value 
is at least two times greater than the pre -treatment value).  
 
A two -stage design will be used to minimize the number of patients exposed to this regimen. There 
are no preliminary efficacy data for this vaccine. The null hypothesis is that the ‘response rate’ 
(percentage  of patients with at least a  two-fold increase  in number  of CD8+ T  cells in the  peripheral 
blood  and tissue  at the final analysis)  is not clinically  meaningful  (<10%).  The alternative  hypothesis 
is that the response rate is clinically meaningful (>10%).  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021

Original  Statistical  Design:  Efficacy  
 
A two -stage design (Simon Minimax) was used where if ≥7 patients’ disease was in ‘response’ 
among 40 evaluable (eligible and began p rotocol treatment) patients (assuming that disease in ≥3 
patients ‘responded’ among [ADDRESS_833771] stage), further testing of this 
regimen was to be considered. The probability of concluding the regimen as effective was 90% if 
the true ‘response  rate’ was 25%.  The probability  of concluding  the regimen  as effective  was 10% if 
the true ‘response rate’ was 10%.  
 
Revised  Statistical  Design:  Efficacy  (Amendment 10) 
 
During  review  of Amendment  10, the statistical  design  for efficacy  has been  changed  per request  of 
SRC in order to revise the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_625765] a 
futile trial. Operating characteristics used in the following design also take into account the poor 
prognosis of th ese patients.  
 
Note that given the observed lack of activity in patients who began protocol treatment prior to 
approval  of Amendment  10, accrual  mentioned  below  refers  to patients  who sign the main  consent 
and begin protocol treatment at the new dose outli ned in Amendment 10.  
 
A two -stage design (Simon Optimal) is used. In the first stage, accrual will continue until 16 
evaluable patients (eligible and begin protocol treatment) are entered. If there is ≤1 patient with a 
two-fold increase in number of CD8+ T  cells, the trial and data will be evaluated and accrual may 
close  with the conclusion  that there  is little evidence  that the ‘response  rate’ would  reach  25%.  The 
probability that the trial will close early is 51% if the true proportion with a two -fold inc rease in 
number of CD8+ T cells is 10%.  
 
If there  are ≥2 patients  among  16 evaluable  patients  with a two-fold increase  in number  of CD8+  T 
cells, the trial will continue to accrue patients until a total of 33 evaluable patients are entered. If 
there are ≥6 patients with a two -fold increase in number of CD8+ T cells among 33 evaluable 
patients, further testing of this vaccine will be conside red. The probability of concluding the 
vaccine is effective is 84% if the true proportion with a two -fold increase in CD8+ T cells is 25%. 
The probability  of concluding  the regimen  is effective  is 10% if the true proportion  with a two-fold 
increase in numb er of CD8+ T cells 10%.  
Considering that patients continue to be screened and at least n=[ADDRESS_833772] been entered and 
began protocol treatment at the original dose prior to approval of Amendment 10, and allowing for 
1 or 2 patients to sign the main con sent and to be registered to the main protocol but not begin 
protocol  treatment  or be ineligible,  the overall  accrual  goal following  approval  of Amendment  10 is 
up to n=44. Since the prevalence of the HLA -A*02 phenotype in the population is approximately 
33%, we assume that we will screen at least 100 patients to be able to treat and follow n=33 
evaluable HLAA* 02 positive patients following approval of Amendment 10. We anticipate that 
among the n=33, that approximately n=[ADDRESS_833773] HPVOC, n=[ADDRESS_833774] cervical 
cancer and n=[ADDRESS_833775] confidence interval.  
Protocol  #: 15-578

Safety will be assessed via the CTCAE and frequencies of adverse events will be summarized and 
will include  all patients  who begin  protocol  treatment  (those  starting  protocol  treatment  before  and 
after approval of Amendment 10). Time to event endpoints will be estimated using the Kaplan - 
Meier method and 95% confidence intervals for the median or time -specific event time will be 
summarized.  
 
With  a monthly  accrual  rate of approximately  [ADDRESS_833776] stage  (n=16 evaluable patients) in order to assess outcome, however, this 
suspension is also dependent on the actual observed accrual rate and the number of patients with a 
two-fold increase in CD8+ T cells while the first stage of the trial is accruing.

APPENDIX B: Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) Quick 
Reference  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/Recist_Guideline.pdf  
Eligibility  
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objective 
tumor response is the primary endpoint.  
 
• Measurable  disease  - the presence  of at least one measurable  lesion.  If the measurable  disease 
is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology when feasible.  
• Measurable  lesions - lesions  that can be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  with 
longest diameter 20 mm us ing conventional techniques or [ADDRESS_833784] scan. If 
no other measurable lesions can be found outside of a previously irradiated field, (i.e. as 
may be seen with locoregional recurrence), and the lesion in the irradiated area meets all 
other condi tions for being measurable, and the lesion is new or has increased in size by [CONTACT_12697] 20% in longest diameter, taking as reference the smallest longest diameter since 
radiation, and the previous radiation was completed at least 6 months prior to registrat ion, it 
can be chosen.  
• Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 
mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_833785] scan), i.e., bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonis,  cystic  lesions,  and also abdominal  masses  that are not confirmed 
and followed by [CONTACT_15218].  
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment . 
• The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
• Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules an d palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Methods  of Measurement  
 
• CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods t o measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed 
with cuts of [ADDRESS_833786], 
abdomen and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific 
protocols.  
 
• Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However , CT is preferable.  
Protocol  #: 15-578 
Version  /Date:  Amendment  11/July  14, 2021  
45  
  
• When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) 
should not be used to  measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical 
measurements  of superficial  palpable  lymph  nodes,  subcutaneous  lesions  and thyroid  nodules. 
US might  also be useful  to confirm  the complete  disappearance  of superficial  lesions  usually 
assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
 
• The utilization  of endoscopy  and laparoscopy  for objective  tumor  evaluation  has not yet been 
fully  and widely  validated.  Their  uses in this specific  context  require  sophisticated  equipment 
and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the 
utilization of such techniques for objectiv e tumor response should be restricted to validation 
purposes in specialized centers. However, such techniques can be useful in confirming 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
 
• Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response when all lesions have disappeared.  
 
• Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e. g., 
after treatment  to differentiate  between  residual  benign  lesions  and residual  malignant  lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).  
 
Baseline  documentation  of “Target”  and “Non -Target”  lesions  
 
• All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  
• Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  with the longest  diameter) 
and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_15078]).  
• A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline  sum LD. The baseline  sum LD will be used as reference  by [CONTACT_625808].  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be record ed at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the presence 
or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD  
At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  taking 
as reference  the smallest  sum LD recorded  since  the treatment  started 
or the appearance of one or more new lesions

Evaluation  of best  overall response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment  started).  In general,  the patient's  best response  assignment  will depend  on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria

PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No PD 
Any PD Yes or No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
• Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
• In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When  the evaluation  of complete  response  depends  on this determination,  it is recommended

that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete 
response status.  
 
Confirmation  
 
• The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response 
rate observed.  In cases where  confirmation  of response  is not feasible,  it should  be made  clear 
when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed.  
• To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3611] [ADDRESS_833787] met. Longer intervals as determined by [CONTACT_625809].  
• In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6 -8 weeks) that is defined in the 
study protocol  
 
Duration  of overall  response  
 
• The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time measurement criteria are  met for 
CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is 
objectively  documented,  taking  as reference  for PD the smallest  measurements  recorded  since 
the treatment started.  
 
Duration  of stable  disease  
 
• SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment st arted.  
 
The clinical  relevance  of the duration  of SD varies  for different  tumor  types and  grades.  Therefore,  it 
is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal time interval required between two 
measurements for determination of SD. This time interval should take into account the expected 
clinical benefit that such a status may bring to the population  under study.

Always  represent  PD  
Incorporated  into tumor  burden  
New, 
nonmeasurable 
lesions  (i.e., <5 × 5

Always  represent  PD  
Do not define  progression  (but 
preclude irCR)  
Non-index  lesions  Changes  contribute  to defining  BOR  of 
CR, PR, SD, and PD  Contribute to defining irCR 
(complete  disappearance  required)  
 
CR Disappearance of all lesions in two 
consecutive  observations  not less than 4 
wk apart  Disappearance  of all lesions  in two 
consecutive observations not less 
than 4 wk apart  
 
 
PR ≥50% decrease in SPD of all index lesions 
compared with baseline in two 
observ ations  at least 4 wk apart,  in absence 
of new lesions or unequivocal progression  
of non-index  lesions   
≥50%  decrease  in tumor  burden 
compared with baseline in two 
observations at least 4 wk apart

of new lesions  or unequivocal  progression 
of non -index lesions  50% decrease in tumor burden 
compared  with baseline  cannot  be 
established nor 25% increase 
compared with nadir  
 
 
PD At least 25% increase in SPD compared 
with nadir  and/or  unequivocal  progression 
of non-index  lesions  and/or  appearance  of 
new lesions (at a ny single time point)  At least 25% increase in tumor 
burden compared with nadir (at 
any single time point) in two 
consecutive  observations  at least 4 
wk apart

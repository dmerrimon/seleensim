EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  9 2 INTRODUCTION  
Daily disposable (DD) contact [CONTACT_234986], as this avoids the use of a lens cleaning product and with the goal to reduce symptoms of dryness and discomfort .
1 As a result, DD lenses account for 45% of all soft 
lens fits today.[ADDRESS_284013] , however, more and more new 
high oxygen- permeable silicone hydrogel (SiHy) DD le nses are becoming available today .  
The goal of this study  is to compare the performance of  MyDay  Energys , a SiHy DD lens from 
CooperVision Inc., which has successfully been established on the market , with ACUVUE OASYS 
MAX 1 -Day, a DD SiHy lens recently launched by [CONTACT_32473] & Johnson Inc.   
3 OBJECTIVES  
To evaluate and compare the performance of MyDay  Energys  (CONTROL) (CooperVision Inc .) 
and ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1 -Day sphere (TEST ) ([COMPANY_012] Inc.) in existing soft lens 
(CL) wearers over one week of wear . 
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
• Lens handling on removal collected on Day 6 on the at -home ratings (0 -100 
scale) .   
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference for  lens handling on removal on Day 6 (At-
home ratings, 0 -100 scale) between CONTROL compared to TEST lens.  
[ADDRESS_284014]/second week  for each participant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their 
first lens dispense.  
This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: ( for 
example www.randomization.com ). The lens type that will be w orn during the first week is called 
“Lens type #1”, the lens type dispensed for the second week is called “Lens type  #2”. The final 
study randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_94648]’s  Database Administrator  and 
provided to the unmasked research assistants at each site .  
5.1.3 MASKING  
This study will be double masked i.e. participants and investigators will be masked to the lens 
type dispensed. In order to achieve this, unmasked research assistants will determine the lens 
order according to the randomization schedule (see section 5.1.2) and will over -label the l ens 
packages/f oils prior to dispense by [CONTACT_234987]/foils to 
mask the participant and investigator to the lens brand.  At the fitting visit both lens types will be 
fit, but only the participant can be masked to the lens type during this process because t he 
investigator needs to know which type is being fit in order to follow the fitting guide when making changes to the lens. During the lens wear phases both investigators and participants will be masked.  
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted at approximately 4 optometry practice sites in the [LOCATION_003] .   
 
5.2.2 INVESTIGATOR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_234980]:  
• Is a l icensed eye care professional  with at least two years of contact [CONTACT_94631].  
• Can demonstrate t raining in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by [CONTACT_94632].  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site. 
EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  11 • Has in- office email and document scanning capabilities.  
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows a timely data review, 
query and entry.  
5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size calculation was based on “lens handling at removal” using historical data at 1 
week in which participant s used a 0-100 scale ([ADDRESS_284015]) .  
A sample size of  [ADDRESS_284016] a mean difference in “ handling at removal ” of [ADDRESS_284017] deviation of the paired differences of 24.2 with 90% power and 
alpha 0.[ADDRESS_284018] 64.

5.3.2 NUMBER OF PART I CIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records, databases and advertising materials (eg. 
posters, email scripts) approved by [CONTACT_94633]. All initial individual -targeted 
recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by [CONTACT_234988]. This separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process will also 
eliminate opportunity for the investigator to  access personal health information before any 
consent for disclosure is provided by [CONTACT_52764].  
It is anticipated that up to [ADDRESS_284019] 64

meibomian gland dysfunction, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1257]), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety  concerns but 
due to fl uctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that  occur secondary

EX-MKTG -[ADDRESS_284024].  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost 
always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by [ADDRESS_284025] lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity,  anterior ocular health assessment, and contact [CONTACT_94654]. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of the study to reduce 
the occurrence of adverse or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instructions from 
their investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
See CORE SOP012 for a description of all adverse events, including management and reporting.  
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’ as defined below , Table 5.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal injection, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnor malities. 
EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  27 for each adverse  event. If both eyes are involved, a separate adverse event form will be completed 
for each eye . Whenever possible, the adverse event will be photo -documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by [CONTACT_456] 
(bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related 
to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. 
The site’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94623] 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life -threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB , CORE and the sponsor . 
Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  and the sponsor as soon as 
possible, but no later than 5 working days after the occurrence.  Each site’s Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_234981]  (by [CONTACT_6791], mail/delivery, phone, or email).  
 
 
   
   
   
   
 
 
  
   
   
   
    
 
Details of all adverse events will be included in the study report. 

EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  28 9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant. Participants discontinued from a study will be reimbursed per visit for their active involvement in the study 
(including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ). Upon discontinuing, a participant will 
be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following 
is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Part icipants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_94625]:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_234982] a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_234983]).  
EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  29 • Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contact[CONTACT_234990], and if the investigator has made a reasonable 
effort to contact [CONTACT_94656] a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by [CONTACT_456], CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation f orm, stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature [CONTACT_94669] .   
When a participant choses to discontinue from the study they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
Adverse Eve nt should be reported to CORE  and the sponsor within 24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the malfunction. Sterling IRB would also be notified within 24 hours of any 
device malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be 
considered as complaints or device malfunctions. 
[ADDRESS_284026] . 
EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  30 12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_94657].  Unmasked data analysis will 
be conducted using Statistica 10 , Statsoft or other suitable software.  Descriptive statistics will 
be provided on demographic data (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table [ADDRESS_284027] will be used to analyze the results 
for the count data of subjective preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the 
number of “no preference” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be equally likely to choose either.  
For assessments conducted for each eye separately, the right eye will be  used for analysis. If a 
general difference is found (paired t -test / Wilcoxon matched pairs) between OD and OS, a 
comment will be  provided 
Where appropriate, data may be presented as both mean and as counts by ‘bucket’ groups.  
Additional analysis may be conducted  

EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  31 12.2 DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data will be collected and written on paper forms which will be provided to each site by [CONTACT_94648]. 
Each site will be instructed to send completed study forms to CORE using a secure file share 
system operated by [CONTACT_234991] 128bit (or 256bit)  SSL 
encryption . The sites will receive their individual accounts and passwords.   
The site will endeavour to send the scanned forms to CORE on the same day as the study 
visit or a maximum  of two days after the study visit.  
Within CORE, d ata will be entered into a REDCap database developed and tested specifically 
for this study and accessible only to trained, authorised users. A data management plan will be 
developed to describe the data handling in more detail, including the personnel involved.  
Data from this study will be retained by [CONTACT_94659] a minimum of [ADDRESS_284028] been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_94648]’s L ead Co-ordinator .  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study.  
This will include training by [CONTACT_234992], study procedures, informed consent 
procedures, and on the randomization and participant masking procedures , as well as training 
for Good Clinical Practice.   
EX-MKTG -148 SUN Protocol v 1.5 23Feb2023  32 All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of  professional indemnity insurance. Additional 
training and site qualification may be required as indicated by [CONTACT_456].  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular status reports to CORE. Status reports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID 
number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2 -weekly stat us reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by [CONTACT_94648], the sponsor, or sponsor’s designate, throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12758]. In addition study records may be inspected by [CONTACT_456], the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by [CONTACT_234993], namely Health Canada and the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_94662]. To improve data integrity, data entry will be conducted by [CONTACT_94663] a second person will visually compare the data entry to the source documents.  Data queries will be reported to the site within 5 working 
days of receipt of initial data. A response resolving the query will be expected from the site within 5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1377] [INVESTIGATOR_234984]’s Lead Coordinator. All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1377] [INVESTIGATOR_234984]’s Director and/or Head of Clinical Research.

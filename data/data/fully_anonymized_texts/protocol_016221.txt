Name         [CONTACT_200438] [ADDRESS_239200] conditions can be treated with a cadaveric cornea transplant.  
However, under some pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases (Steven Johnson 
Syndrome, Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid, Rheumatoid  Arthritis), and previous cornea transplant 
graft failure, repeat corneal transplants have a very poor likelihood of success.   
Additionally, d ue to the changes in survival, munitions, and style of warfare, the proportion of 
surviving soldiers with serious anterior segment  eye trauma has progressively escalated over the 
last century. According to Veterans Affairs ( VA) data, eye trauma accounted for 15% of all 
battlefield injuries during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, resulting 
in over 186,[ADDRESS_239201] a very poor likelihood of cornea transplant  
success.     
In these high risk patient populations, a keratoprosthesi s (artificial cornea) is used. The [LOCATION_011] 
keratoprosthesis ([LOCATION_011] KPro) is an artificial cornea developed at the [LOCATION_005] Eye and 
Ear Infirmary under the leadership of [CONTACT_200440] D ohlman. It was FDA -approved in 1992 for use 
in subjects with repeated corneal graft failures, ocular chemical burns, autoimmune and 
cicatrizing diseases, aniridia and ocular herpetic infections. This increasingly popular prosthesis 
has helped restore visio n to thousands of subjects who otherwise had no other viable alternatives. 
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_200384], some of 
these keratoprosthesis subjects go on to develop sterile ulcerations and thinning of the c ornea 
tissue which acts as a carrier for the keratoprosthesis. This corneal melting (keratolysis) of the 
donor cornea still remains a rare yet devastating post -operative complication that leads to 
exposure to pathogens, perforation, leakage of the aqueous humor and extrusion of the 
keratoprosthesis.  
Page [ADDRESS_239202] suggested that corneal melts can be reduced 
by [CONTACT_200408] -linking the donor cornea, a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double -
masked, vehicle -controlled study is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cross -linking of 
the keratoprosthesis carrier cornea.  
 
1.2 Rationale  
The experimental drug for this trial is riboflavin (vitamin B2) 0.1% solution  and dextran 20% 
solution.  The medication includes a  formula that is applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_200385].  The riboflavin reduces the intensity of the UV light  that penetrates 
the cornea  by 95%.  
Cross-linking is a term that refers to the linking of polymers (long chain) molecules by [CONTACT_200409]. It is commonly performed in industry when manufacturing synthetic materials. 
Biologically, cross -linking has been used to modify or strengthen tissue such as porcine valves 
used in heart surgery. Corneal cross -linking was first  suggested in [LOCATION_013] in the 1990s. Since 
the cornea is predominantly made of long structural proteins called collagen, it was theorized 
that cross -linking the collagen should make the cornea stronger and resistant to degradation. The 
combined use of ultra violet A light and riboflavin (as a photosensitizer) was shown to be a 
simple and effective cross -linking technique. Animal studies have shown this method to be safe. 
In addition, researchers found cross -linked corneas to be highly resistant to enzymatic 
degradation.  
Human clinical trials have been conducted in Europe for the use of riboflavin/UVA corneal 
cross-linking in subjects with ocular diseases that involve corneal thinning such as keratoconus. 
Such trials are currently underway in the [LOCATION_002].  There are many published reports 
demonstrating the safety of this method in humans. The [LOCATION_005] Eye and Ear Infirmary 
has been approved to join one of the multi -center study trials using the Caporossi -Baiocchi-
Mazzotta (CBM) VEGA X -linker). The goal  of our study is to use the same protocol designed 
for that study for our study. The exception is that the corneal cross -linking of the donor corneal 
tissue will be performed ex -vivo prior to the [LOCATION_011] KPro assembly. The [LOCATION_011] KPro assembly 
will otherwis e remain unchanged and the patient will not be exposed to the UVA light.  
Page [ADDRESS_239203] notoriously poor correlations with  
human clinical outcomes.  
Initially, we worked on determining the optimal riboflavin/UVA cross -linking method to 
increase resistance of the corneas to enzymatic degradation ex -vivo. 
The methodology was as follows. The corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_200386] a 57 blade. The corneas with 2 -3mm 
scleral rims were excised and their irises were removed. They were fitted into Barron® artificial 
anterior chambers with the endothelium bathed in i sotonic saline solution. The VEGA® LED -
based UVA emitter was switched on for at least 30 minutes prior to calibration then was 
calibrated before the experiments. The corneas were then pre -treated with 0.1% riboflavin/20% 
dextran T500 every 2 -3 minutes for 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_200410] ( λ= 370nm, irradiation = 
3mW/cm2) at a fixed distance of 54mm from the top of the corneas for 5 -minute intervals, while 
applying riboflavin between irradiations. Either the anterior stroma (A) or the anterior (A) and 
posterior stroma (P) was irradiated for different durations (7.5A, 7.5A/7.5P, 15A, 15A/15P, 30A, 
30A/30P and 60A minutes). The primary control was no riboflavin/no UVA. Secondary controls 
included riboflavin/no UVA and UVA/no riboflavin. The corneas were trephined into 8.5 -mm 
buttons and incubat ed in clean glass vials containing 0.3% collagenase A solutions at 37°C and 
rotating at 150 rotations -per-minute. The time to total dissolution of the corneas was measured. 
Each group included 4 or more corneas.  
Results showed that the primary control diss olved at 4.8h ±0.8 while tissue cross -linked for 15 
minutes dissolved after 50.0 +/ - 8.1 hours. Compared to the control, there was a marked increase 
in resistance to degradation for all UVA/riboflavin cross -linked corneas. In general, anterior 
stromal cros s-linking was superior to anterior/posterior stromal cross -linking (whether the 
irradiation time was split or doubled between the anterior and posterior stromata compared to 
their matched groups of anteriorly cross -linked corneas). The minimal treatment th at yielded the 
greatest resistance in all groups was 15 minutes of anterior stromal cross -linking (50.0h 
 8.1; 
p<0.0001).  The results were similar for 15, 30, and 60 minutes of cross -linking. Therefore, we 
identified several methods to increase the cornea l resistance to enzymatic degradation using the 
corneal cross -linking technique.  
The UVA emitter emits constant irradiation energy of 3mW/cm2 that requires the UVA light 
source to be at 54mm from the cross -linked cornea. The irradiated area can be controll ed using 
Page 7 of 48 
 the UV spot aperture control. This fixed setup ensures homogenous irradiation of the corneal 
surface with the desired fixed energy. Unfortunately, this UVA emitter was not designed to 
irradiate at any energies other than 3mW/cm2. Changing the dist ance will vary the size of the 
irradiated area (and possibly the energies unpredictably). The new irradiation area created will 
not be commensurate with the desired area we set up on the aperture control. In addition, we 
cannot guarantee that the new area created would provide homogenous irradiation.  Therefore, 
we will use the manufacturer’s recommended distance of 54 mm with constant irradiation energy 
of 3mW/cm2.  The VEGA emitter above and Avedro KXL UVA emitter to be used in this study 
have equivalent l ight settings and intensity.  
We also studied the assembly of the [LOCATION_011] keratoprosthesis device in 3 human cross -linked 
corneas using the same methodology described above (after 30 minutes of cross -linking). The 
[LOCATION_011] KPro devices were assembled with cros s-linked tissue and untreated control cornea 
tissue. [CONTACT_200441], [CONTACT_200442] and [CONTACT_200443] inspected the assembled KPro units and found 
that grossly and microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the [LOCATION_011] KPro devices fit securely around the cross -linked 
tissue. There did not appear to be any difference in the [LOCATION_011] KPro assembly between the cross -
linked corneas and [ADDRESS_239204]. John Kanellopoulos  who also practices in [LOCATION_001] .  The P.I. ([CONTACT_200442]) has traveled 
to Athens and performed a chart review on the three cases and has maintained communication 
with [CONTACT_200444] on the status of the three cases.  At last follow -up, all the cases were 
doing well despi[INVESTIGATOR_200387]. Kanellopoulos has since published a paper 
on [ADDRESS_239205]. 
Kanellopoulos .  
This study’s population will include subjects who are both candidates for a [LOCATION_011] KPro and had 
either a history of corneal melting (keratolysis) or have high risk for corneal melting. [LOCATION_011] 
KPro candidates include subjects with visual loss due to corneal scarring that are not candidates 
for a traditional  corneal transplant. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], these subjects have either failed a corneal 
transplant or have ocular findings that strongly predict a very high likelihood of cornea transplant 
failure (e.g. subjects with extensive neovascularization of the cornea).  Subjects at high risk for 
corneal melt include, but are not limited to, those with underlying autoimmune diseases such as 
ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and 
others.  We are aiming to enroll [ADDRESS_239206] of the [LOCATION_002] for the 
treatment of corneal ectasias (keratoconus), but not for  this purpose of  preventing corn eal melts.  
To our knowledge, the drugs and devices have not been withdrawn from any research or market 
due to reasons related to safety or efficacy.

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
This is a phase I/II prospective, randomized, multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -controlled 
clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of corneal collagen cross -linking the 
keratoprosthesis carrier tissue in subjects who are candidates for high -risk keratoprosthesis 
implantation because of a h istory of corneal melts, sterile corneal ulcers, or autoimmune diseases 
(e.g., Stevens -Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid).  
 
Objective 1:  
Determine the safety of using a collagen cross -linked cornea as a carrier for the [LOCATION_011] 
Keratoprosthesis  in subjects who are at high risk for corneal melts and are not candidates for  a 
standard corneal transplant.  
 
Objective 2:  
Determine the efficacy of using a collagen cross -linked cornea as a carrier for the [LOCATION_011] 
Keratoprosthesis in preventing corneal me lts and increasing the retention of the keratoprosthesis. 
This will be tested using the outcome measures  listed in section 10 .

3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 Study Design Description  
The study is a multi -center, parallel, randomize d, double-blinded study with  a subsequent 
follow-up period of 2 years (week 52)  and standard of care follow up every [ADDRESS_239207] a cadaveric cornea from 
CorneaGen (previously KeraLink  International ) the central eye bank for this study . The eye bank 
will assign the subject the next available subject (randomization) number, in ascending 
sequential order according to the block schedule until all assignments have be en used. The eye 
bank will then prepare the cadaveric cornea according to one of following two randomization 
groups in equal allocations:  
Group 1: Active Treatment Arm  
De-epi[INVESTIGATOR_200388] -linked with riboflavin 0.1%  with dextran 20% AND 
ultraviolet A light.  
Group 2: Control Treatment Arm  
• De-epi[INVESTIGATOR_200389]  0.1% with dextran  20% (NO 
ultraviolet A light).  
As detailed in section 5 , both the treatment arm and control arm corneas will be labeled with 
their unique randomized identification number in a sealed bottle of OptiZol® solution, as per the 
standard of care for cornea donor preservation. The tissue bank will follow their standard 
operating procedures for the packaging and shipment of the tissue. The masked corneas will be 
sent to the masked investigators, who will perform the assembly and implantation of the [LOCATION_011] 
Keratoprosthesis. The procedure will be unchanged from a typi[INVESTIGATOR_200390] (see study procedures in sect ion 7). 
Page [ADDRESS_239208] for this 
procedure. This will include visits at Day 1, Week s 1, 4, 16, 24, 36, and 52, . Subjects following 
[LOCATION_011] KPro surgery are typi[INVESTIGATOR_200391] 6months aft er one year follow -up. However, some 
may need to be seen more regularly if they require more frequent monitoring for conditions such 
as glaucoma. The investigators will monitor for systemic and ocular adverse events at all follow -
up visits. All adverse eve nts will be reported to the principal investigator  [CONTACT_73651]; 
and then to the  MEEI HSC, sub-sites, DOD, and FDA per the specified guidelines.  
4.2 Allocation /Randomization  to Treatment   
Eighty-four subjects will be randomized equally to treatment or control group.  Randomization 
will be stratified by 16 centers, as well as two pre -operative diagnostic categories: autoimmune 
disease vs. prior corneal melt without autoimmune disease. Thus there will be a total of 32 strata. 
Stratification will ensure  balance of the stratification factors between the two arms of the study. 
A number of blocks of varying size will be determined (e.g. 5 blocks of size 4, 6 blocks of size 
2) and randomization assignments will be prepared accordingly. Since we have [ADDRESS_239209] future treatment 
assignments is increased due to smaller block sizes, we do not think that this will be a major 
issue for the present study.  
The study statistician at Mass Eye and Ear will prepare the computer -generated randomization 
schedules and treatment strata prior to commencement of the study. Codes will be used to label 
different treatment assignments so study site personnel will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
The randomization schedule will be determined in 4 steps: 1) arrange th e initial treatment 
assignments arbitrarily, 2) generate via computer a list of pseudorandom numbers, 3) link the 
initial treatment codes with the pseudorandom numbers, 4) order the pseudorandom numbers 
from smallest to largest with associated treatment co des to determine the final order of treatment 
assignments . The final treatment order and strata will be communicated by [CONTACT_200411].  
4.2.[ADDRESS_239210]. The eye bank will use the 
Page 12 of 48 
 randomization schedules according to the stratum of the patient (center and autoimmune 
disease status) and assign  the subject the next treatment available. Each consecutive 
patient who falls into the same stratum will be assigned the next treatment assignment on 
this sheet until all assignments have been used. Whenever a patient is enrolled who falls 
into a stratum f or which no sheets have been started or for which all previous sheets have 
been completed, the next sheet will be used according to the appropriate stratum, and so 
on.  After the tissue is prepared, it will be sent to the site in a bottle labeled with the 
subject’s identification number.

6. STUDY DRUG(S)/DEVICE(S)   
 
6.1 Study Drug/Device Information  
Riboflavin Solution and Ultraviolet A Light System.  
The experimental drug for this trial is Riboflavin solution (0.1% rib oflavin and 20% dextran 
supplied in a sterile, single -dose container). Avedro Inc. ( Baltimore, MD ) is supplying both the 
0.1% riboflavin  and 20% dextran  ophthalmic solution and the UV light source (KXL system) 
that are manufactured, tested and released acc ording to current good manufacturing practices 
(cGMP) and the FDA’s quality system regulations. The riboflavin being used is the same 
solution that is currently under investigation in the [LOCATION_002] in multiple clinical trials. In this 
trial, the medica tion is applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_200392] 95%. Tissue in the control 
group will have the medication applied without exposure to UV light.  
 
Active Trea tment Arm  
The donor cornea will be placed on an artificial anterior chamber maintainer (a device which 
holds the cornea in place while bathing the cornea endothelium in saline [balanced salt 
solution]). The donor corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_200393]. Riboflavin solution 
(0.1% riboflavin and 20% dextran supplied in a sterile, single -dose container) will be applied to 
the cornea every 2 -3 minutes for 15 minutes prior to the beginning of the UV light application. 
The riboflavin solution will be supp lied as a 3 -mL solution by [CONTACT_200413], Inc. and is the same 
solution that is currently under investigation in the [LOCATION_002] in multiple clinical trials. The 
UV source will be from the KXL® System (Avedro, Inc.). The machine is first calibrated to 
ensure irradiation energies of 3.0 mW/cm2. A wavelength of [ADDRESS_239214] 5.4 
J/cm2 using a beam diameter of 9.5mm to treat the de -epi[INVESTIGATOR_200394] [ADDRESS_239215] of care, the cornea 
Page 16 of 48 
 will be placed in a sterile container containing O ptiZol® solution, sealed, and labeled with the 
subject identification number.  
 
Control Treatment Arm  
Subjects in the control arm will receive corneas that have NOT been cross -linked, but have 
undergone procedures to ensure that the control tissue looks the  same as the treated tissue. These 
steps will be performed in order to reduce the likelihood that the masked investigators would 
become aware of the tissue assignment. The corneas in the control arm will be placed on an 
anterior chamber maintainer and de -epi[INVESTIGATOR_200395]. The control arm tissue will then be topi[INVESTIGATOR_200396] [ADDRESS_239216] not undergone cross -linking corneas. 
Like the corneas in the treatment arm, the control arm corneas will be rinsed profusely with 
normal saline, placed in a sterile container containing OptiZol® solution, sealed, and labeled 
with the subject identification number.  
 
6.2 Study Drug /Device Compliance/Adherence  
Subjects will not be administering the study drug.  
 
6.3 Study Drug Supplies  
Avedro Inc. will be providing the Riboflavin solution directly to  CorneaGen .

6.7 Concomitant  Medication  
Antibiotics:  
First line recommended antibiotic prophylaxis consists of  polytrim and vancomycin (14 mg/ml 
with or without preservatives).  
Polytrim should be given as one drop [ADDRESS_239218] to each pati ent's 
needs per the discretion of the study investigator.

Steroids: 
All subjects will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1% prednisolone acetate drops 4x/day for 6 weeks, 3x/day for 6 
weeks, 2x/day for 6 weeks, then 1x/ day for the remain der of the first [ADDRESS_239219] ‘glaucoma’ care regimens. If this 
proves inadequate and the intraocular pressure management becomes difficult, the dose

8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 Screening Process 
Potential study participants will be identified by [CONTACT_200415]. All qualified patients who:  
• meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria in section 4,  
• are determined to be candidates for KPro surgery,  
• have discussed the risks and potential benefits of that surgery with a study licensed 
physician, and  
• state their intent to have that surgery will be asked if they are interested in  hearing more 
about the study.  
 
If the patient expresses interest in the study, t he licensed physician/investigator will review the 
study design and treatment regimen with him or her, and will go over the information in the 
consent form.  If the patient states that he or she is interested in participating in the study, a 
screening visi t will be scheduled, and the patient will be given a copy of the consent to take 
home and read. Patients are encouraged to go over the consent form with other health care 
providers.  
 
Those subjects who volunteer to participate (after signing the written i nformed consent) will be 
enrolled consecutively during routine visits to the study sites. The study eye will be identified at 
the screening visit. Only one eye of each eligible patient will be enrolled into the study. Standard 
subject reimbursement ($75) i s provided at visit one  (screening visit)  and the final visit (visit 
week 52) to cover parking, meals and other incidentals associated with the patient’s participation 
in the study. Visit one includes the consent process and the final visit will include a number of 
imaging steps not required for clinical care. All non -standard assessments will be covered by [CONTACT_200416].  
 
Candidate subjects that live at a great distance from the study site and are unable to attend a 
screening visit and provide signed inf ormed before the day of the scheduled surgery may be 
Page [ADDRESS_239221] and 
randomization (the ordering of the tissue from the tissue bank). In this event the subject in 
question will be consen ted following the “Remote Consent” procedures described below.  
 
8.2 Consent Process:  
 
8.2.1 Remote Consent  
Candidate subjects that live at a great distance from the study site and /or are unable to attend a 
screening visit and provide signed informed before  the day of the scheduled surgery may be 
allowed to provide remote consent for the purpose of screening of medical record and 
randomization (the ordering of the cornea tissue from the tissue bank). In order for the subject to 
be eligible for remote consent  the followi ng process has to be followed.  
1. When a potential study subject is identified by [CONTACT_200417]. If the 
candidate subject expresses intere st in the study but needs additional time to consider 
participation the study MD will give the candidate subject a copy of the consent form and 
ask that the candidate subject call the study staff if they are interested in participating in 
the research stud y. 
2. When the candidate subject calls study staff and confirm their interest in participating in 
the study, the study staff will schedule a time for the candidate subject to speak to the 
MD investigator. Study staff will also mail the candidate subject a new  copy of the study 
Informed Consent Form.  
3. At the time of the scheduled call the MD investigator will review the consent form with 
the subject over the phone. MD investigator will answer all subject questions.  
4. If the candidate subject agrees to participate  in the research study the MD investigator 
will ask the candidate subject to sign, date and time the consent form. Once the consent 
form is signed the MD investigator will ask the study subject to mail the signed consent 
form to the study staff.  
5. After the phone call is compete the MD investigator will complete and sign the 
“Informed Consent Checklist” to affirm that consenting procedures were followed.  
6. When the study staff received the signed consent form over the mail the MD investigator 
will sign the con sent form.  
Page [ADDRESS_239222] provided remote consent will be re -consented in person by [CONTACT_200418] (day of surgery). MD investigator will 
complete a new “Informed Consent Checklist” to record this in person cons ent. Study 
subjects will be given a copy of both of the signed consent form.  
8. Both consent forms (remote & in person) will be filed in the subject study binder and a 
note will be made in the patient’s medical record to note their participation in the study.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_239223].  The MD 
Investigator will specifically review the study procedures, visit schedule, risk and benefits, 
alternative treatments and rights to withdraw and ask questions with all potential subjects before 
signing the consent form.   If the patient agrees to participate in the trial, the consent form will be 
signed in front of the MD investigator who will also sign and date the consent form.  A copy of 
the signed consent for m will be given to the patient and a note  will be made in the patient’s 
medical record to note their participation in the study.  The study -specific screening evaluations 
will then be performed.  
 
A note will be made on the study record that the informed consent was signed by [CONTACT_2299]. 
The informed consent  process will follow the guidelines set by [CONTACT_200419]’s IRB. Every

8.4 Day 0: Drug or Device Procedures  
Study drug will only be administered by [CONTACT_200421] 5.1.  Implantation of the [LOCATION_011] Keratoprosthesis unit  may occur up to [ADDRESS_239224] will be repeated on day 0 or within 30 days 
of the scheduled surgery.  
Keratoprosthesis Implantation Procedure  
Subjects will undergo keratoprosthesis implantation under general or retrobulbar/peribulbar 
anesthesia. Massed corneal donor tissues will be removed from the Optisol GS storage media. 
The donor cornea will be trephined from the endothelial surface. Trephine size will be selected 
according to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_200399] e (range 7.0 –9.0 mm), and the donor –recipi[INVESTIGATOR_200400] 
0.25–0.[ADDRESS_239225] to complete the keratoprosthesis unit.  
As a unit, keratoprosthesis and donor tissue are then transferred to the patient’s eye and suture d 
into position using interrupted sutures, not unlike a traditional cornea transplant. A [ADDRESS_239226] to each 
patient's needs. At the conclusion of the case, the bandage contact [CONTACT_13293]) that accompanies the 
[LOCATION_011] Keratoprosthesis device will be placed on the eye.  
 
Post-Operative Care  
All subjects will receive the standard treatment with corticosteroid and antibiotic eye drops.  All 
subjects will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1% prednisolone acetate drops 4x/day for 6 weeks, 3x/day for 6 
weeks, 2x/day for 6 weeks, then 1x/ day for the remainder of the first [ADDRESS_239227] ‘glaucoma’ care regimens. If this 
proves inadequate and the intraocul ar pressure management becomes difficult, the dose 
(frequency and potency) of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_200398], especially if there is a 
history of steroid -responsiveness. If maximally tolerated medical therapy does not sufficiently 
control intra ocular pressure, alternative approaches to intraocular pressure control should be 
considered.

fortified vancomycin 14 mg/mL topi[INVESTIGATOR_200401] a day  based on the drug 
availability and upon the discretion of the site principal investigator . 
There may be specific features in a given patient that will lead the investigator to use a different 
post-operative regimen; therefore we will record the use of all medications at each visit.  
A bandage contact [CONTACT_13293] (Kon tur Kontact Lens Co, Inc.) will be worn continuously on the study 
eye. The diameter, base curve, brand, and replacement schedule will depend on the patient’s 
needs. The presence and type of contact [CONTACT_200422].  
All subjects wil l be instructed in the signs and symptoms of infection or vitritis (decrease in

8.6 Follow-up Procedures  
Additionally, t o determine the safety and efficacy of using riboflavin -ultraviolet light induced 
collagen cross -linked cornea tissue in promoting retention, follow -up visits will be scheduled at 
Day 1 and 7 (±3 days ), week 4 (±3 days), week 16 (±2 weeks), week 24 (±3 weeks), week 36 (±3 
weeks), and week 52 (±4 weeks ). Following week [ADDRESS_239231] of care visits (post 
week 52 visit) in order to monitor subject safety for an additional  3 years or until study closure . 
Any procedures/exams performed during these visits will be standard of care and the MD will 
decide which procedures/exams are needed. Study staff will collect  data for any 
procedures/exams that may be conducted as they pertain to the study (changes in medical history 
and medication prescription; BCVA, slit -lamp exam, IOP, funduscopy/B -Scan, OCT images, slit 
lamp photography and review of potential adverse events).  
 
A description of imaging procedures follow  in this section and a  table of follow-up procedures  
organized by [CONTACT_5586]-point can be found in section 7.[ADDRESS_239232] images will be obtained at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 2 70, 315 and 360 degrees.  
 
 
Page 28 of 48 
 Slit Lamp Photography  
Because it is possible that slit lamp findings may be predictive of keratoprosthesis loss or cornea l 
thinning, digital corneal photography will be done using a slit -lamp with a digital camera 
attachment and a flash -through-the-slit illumination system. By [CONTACT_200426] p rior to corneal transplant surgery at  the screening vi sit, and at Week(s) 1, 4, 16, [ADDRESS_239233] of ca re visits and any procedures/exams performed 
during these visits will be standard of care and will be decided by [CONTACT_200427].  Study 
staff will collect data for any procedures/exams that may be conducted as they pertain to the 
study (changes in medi cal history and medication prescription, BCVA, slit -lamp exam, IOP, 
funduscopy/B -Scan, OCT images, slit lamp photography and review of potential adverse events).  
Study staff will not collect data for any procedures/exams that are not study related and are not 
listed above.  
 
 8.[ADDRESS_239234] may be 
withdrawn from the study for any reasons: if it is in the best interest of the subject, intercurrent 
illness, adverse e vents, or worsening condition.  The  site investigators or Medical Monitor may 
request the withdrawal of a subject because of protocol violations, administrative reasons, or any 
other valid and ethical reasons.   
Reasons for subject termination  may include,  but are not limited to, the following:  
• Investigator determination that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue 
participation  
• Serious adverse events  
Page 29 of 48 
 • Any other safety concerns  
In the event of an adverse event in the study eye that is consi dered by [CONTACT_200428], the donor tissue will be removed and replaced with 
fresh cadaveric human cornea donor tissue with or without a keratoprosthesis, discontinuing the 
patient from further participation i n the study.

 9. SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENTS  
 
9.1 Safety Assessments  
The safety of the study intervention will be evaluated at every visit following surgery and will be 
defined by [CONTACT_19907]. Specifically, we will evaluate:  
• Systemic safety : Incidence and severity of systemic adverse events during the study  
(based on physical examination, subject self -reporting, and changes in vital sign).  
• Ocular safety : Incidence and severity of ocular adverse events during the study 
(ophthalmic examination, adverse events spontaneously reported).  Ocular adverse events 
of special interest will include Infections Keratitis, Positive fungal rim culture and 
Retinal Detachment  
All adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_200430] 24 hours of notification and 
reported on the following schedule:  
 
• Possibly, Probably, or D efinitely Related Expected AE – Report to IRB on annual basis  
(continuing review)   
• Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related Expected Serious AE – Report to IRB on 
annual basis (continuing review)  
• Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related Unexpected AE – Report to IRB  within 5 
business days of discovery of event.  
• Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related Unanticipated Problem – Report to IRB 
within 5 business days discovery of event (24 hours for death of data loss)  
• Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Relate d Unexpected Serious AE – Report to IRB 
within   5 business days of discovery of  event   
 
The Medical Monitor (DSMC Chair), Dean Cestari, MD  is required to review all unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others, serious adverse events, and  subject deaths. The 
monitor must comment on the outcomes of the event, the relationship of the event to 
participation in the study,  and must indicate whether he concurs with the details of the report 
provided by [CONTACT_458].   The Medical Monitor, is responsible to oversee the safety 
Page 32 of 48 
 of the research and report observations/findings to the IRB or a designated institutional official. 
The Medical Monitor will review all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others 
associated with  the protocol and provide an independent report of the event to the IRB. The 
Medical Monitor may discuss the research protocol with the investigators; shall have authority to 
stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects from a res earch protocol, 
and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subjects 
until the IRB can assess the monitor’s report; and shall have the responsibility to promptly report 
their observations and findings to the IRB or o ther designated official and the HRPO.  
• Reports for events determined by [CONTACT_200431]  
• Reports of events resul ting in death must be promptly forwarded to the [LOCATION_003]MRMC ORP 
HRPO 
 
9.2 Surgery Related Adverse Events  
A surgical related adverse event is any adverse event that is related to or possibly related to the 
[LOCATION_011] Keratoprosthesis surgical procedure. Any  surgical related, normal and expected 
postoperative complaints or symptoms  (adverse events)  that occur within 30 days of surgery 
(week 4 visit) are not required to be reported  as adverse events , unless the event involves a 
clinically significant change in severit y or duration of symptoms or requires clinical intervention 
that is different from ordinary postoperative care. Examples include:  
 
• Eye redness  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_50024]  
• Decreased vision  
• Anterior chamber cell  
• High eye pressure (up to 28)  
• Eye pain 
 
Other expected postoperative care complaints and symptoms that will are not required to be 
reported as an adverse event include : headache, incisional pain, nausea, vomiting, low grade 
fever, dizziness, irritability, nervousness, temporary sleep problems like insomnia or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
constipation, confusion and similar events, tenderness, throat soreness secondary to intubation, 
Page 33 of 48 
 or mild to moderate swelling and/or bruising around the implant site, back pain due to lying on 
the table during the procedure.   
 
9.3 Effectiveness  Assessments  
The efficacy of corneal collagen cross -linking of keratoprosthesis carrier tissue in high -risk 
keratoprosthesis implantation will be judged using the following parameters and time points:  
 
Primary endpoints or outcome measure(s)  
• Time from surg ery to device loss or replacement  
 
Secondary endpoints or outcome measure(s)  
• Twelve-month retention rate  
• Incidence of delayed epi[INVESTIGATOR_200402]  30 (week 4 visit)  
• Cornea thickness metrics measured by  [CONTACT_113879]-OCT; at week(s) 1, 4, 16, 24, 36, and 52. 
• Time from surgery to retroprosthetic membrane treatment (laser or surgical interventions)  
• Time from surgery to occurrence of vitritis (sterile or infectious)  
• Time from surgery to occurrence of ocular surgery to address melt, including partial 
graft. 
 
Page [ADDRESS_239236] -surgical treatment. During each clinical 
examination participants will be queried about occurrenc e of adverse events. Slit lamp 
examination and ocular assessments will determine change in corneal thickness and or presence 
of corneal ulcers. Lastly, site investigators and study staff will be asked to report unanticipated 
problems or adverse events within 48 business days of discovery  to the coordinating center 
(MEE) to allow for proper reporting.   
 
All observed or volunteered adverse events (serious or non -serious) and abnormal test findings, 
regardless of study group or suspected causal r elationship t o the study drug  will be recorded in 
the subjects’ case histories (source data, case report form).  For all adverse events, sufficient 
information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the 
outcome of the event (i.e ., whether the event should be classified as a serious adverse event) and; 
2)  an assessment of the causal relationship between the adverse event and the study drug.    
 
Adverse events thought to be associated with the study drug will be followed until the  event (or 
its sequel) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Sponsor-
Investigator  and the study Medical Monitor . 
Study staff will alert the treating physician immediately of any participant complaints or 
problems that are expressed to them. The site investigator and/or site study staff will report any 
unexpected and serious adverse events to the coordinating center (MEE) within 48 hours of 
discovery regardless of the assumed relation to the study intervention . The site investigator and 
the study staff will follow the reporting guidelines below.  
Page 35 of 48 
  
➢ Causality and Severity Assessment  
The Sponsor -Investigator of the IND  application and the Medical Monitor (DSMC chair) will 
promptly review documented adverse events to dete rmine 1) if there is a reasonable possibility 
that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s); and 2) if the adverse event meets the 
criteria for a serious adverse event.  
If the Sponsor -Investigator’s and Medical Monitor’s final determination of cau sality is 
“unknown and of questionable r elationship to the study drug ”, the adverse event will be 
classified as associated w ith the use of the study drug  for reporting purposes.  If the Sponsor -
Investigator’s  and Medical Monitor’s  final determination of ca usality is “unknown but not 
related to the study drug ”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be 
documented in the respective subject’s case history  (source data or case report form) .  
 
10.2 Reporting Procedures  
➢ Reporting of Adver se Events to FDA  
o Written IND Safety Reports (if applicable)  
o Telephoned IND Safety Reports  – Fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse 
reactions  
➢ Reporting Adverse E vents to the Partner Human Research Committee  
The Partners Human Research Committee (PHRC)  policy for “ REPORTING ADVERSE 
EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS” will be followed.  
➢ Reporting Adverse Events to External Parties  
Adverse events will be reported to the [LOCATION_003]rmy’s Human Research Protections Office 
(HRPO) and the US Food and Drug Administratio n per their guidelines . Certain adverse 
events, specifically infections with positive donor rim cultures,  that are related to the 
cornea donor tissue will be reported to  CorneaGen  within 48 hours of discovery .  
 
 10.3 Termination, of Subjects due to Advers e Events 
Termination from the study will happen if any of the following occurs:  
• Subject’s wish to withdraw for any reason.  
Page 36 of 48 
 • Investigator or Research Monitor  determination that it is not in the best interest of the 
subject to continue participation  
• KPro  removal 
In the event an adverse event in the study eye is severe enough to require the donor  study tissue 
to be removed and replaced with fresh cadaveric human cornea donor tissue with or without a 
keratoprosthesis, the patient  will be terminated from further  participation in the study.  However, 
prior to termination the patient will be followed for [ADDRESS_239237] 
any additional event data.

11.3 Sample Size Determination  
To determine the number of subjects to enroll, we performed sample size calculations based on a 
review of keratoprosthesis retention rates from prior studies and conservative estimates of 
efficacy in the treatment arm. For t he control arm, we used twelve-month retention rates ranging 
from 50 to 60%, which has been reported in autoimmune eyes at high risk for keratoprosthesis 
loss. Therefore, we anticipate the twelve month retention rate for the untreated (not cross -linked) 
cornea will be 50 -60%.To estimate the retention rate in the treatment arm, we reviewed the 
retention rates from the two published case reports that describe cross -linking of the 
keratoprosthesis carrier cornea in high -risk eyes (Kanellopoulos et. al. & Rober t). While the two 
case reports describe a 100% retention rate in a total of [ADDRESS_239238] a 30% difference in 
retention rate between the treatment group and the control group and specified the probability of 
type 1 error of 0.05, a study power of 80%, a follow up period of twelve-months, and a 4% loss 
to follow up . In order to detect a difference between the control arm and the treatment arm using 
Page 38 of 48 
 these considerations, the calculations resulted in sample size estimates between 82 and 88 
subjects (Table 2). For practical purposes, we also took into consideration the  time available for 
the study and the number of high risk keratoprosthesis procedures performed at each study site. 
Using the mid -range estimates, we aim to enroll 84 subjects into this study.  
Eighty-four subjects will be randomized equally to treatment o r control group.  Randomization 
will be stratified by 16 centers, as well as two pre -operative diagnostic categories: autoimmune 
disease vs. prior corneal melt without autoimmune disease. Eye with a history of autoimmune 
disease may have a different risk o f a new melt than eye that have a history of a prior corneal 
melt. Thus there will be a total of 32 strata. Stratification will ensure balance of the stratification 
factors between the two arms of the study. A number of blocks of varying size will be 
determined (e.g. 5 blocks of size 4, 6 blocks of size 2) and randomization assignments will be 
prepared accordingly. Since we have [ADDRESS_239239] future treatment assignments is increased due to smaller block sizes, we 
do not think that this will be a m ajor issue for the present study.

characteristics will be conducted using Chi -square, or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.  
 
Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will follow an intent -to-treat analysis strategy including all 
randomized eyes. The major goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of using a collagen 
cross-linked cornea as a carrier for the [LOCATION_011] K eratoprosthesis in preventing corneal melts and 
increasing the retention of the keratoprosthesis. The primary endpoint of the efficacy analysis is 
time from surgery to device loss or replacement. Kaplan -Meier plot of event free survival by 
[CONTACT_200432] -rank test will be used to examine if survival curves are 
significant different between groups.  In addition, we will use a proportional hazards regression 
model to test the effectiveness of using a collagen cross -linked cornea as a carrier for the [LOCATION_011] 
Keratoprosthesis in preventing corneal melts and increasing the retention of the keratoprosthesis. 
We will obtain an estimate (95% CI) of the hazard ratio of device loss comparing treatment with 
control. This framework allows for t he control of covariates, which may be unbalanced by 
[CONTACT_200433][INVESTIGATOR_200403]. If Kaplan -Meier plots of event free 
survival by [CONTACT_200434], or related plots of log ( -log) (survival) indicate violations of the 
proportional haz ards assumption, then weighted log -rank test will be used according to strategies 
described by [CONTACT_200435].  
 
Secondary Analysis  
We plan to conduct a number of pre -specified analyses of secondary study endpoints. Analyses 
of secondary “time -to-event” type endpoints (time to retroprosthetic membrane treatment and 
time to occurrence of vitritis) will use the Kaplan -Meier approach with log -rank test and Cox 
proportional hazards regression, similar to the primary analysis for time to device loss.

be described and compared between treatment arms of the study.

12. DATA AND SAFETY MO NITORING  
 
 12.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be formed prior to trial initiation. The 
committee members will consist of experts in corneal disease, and the study biostatistician . In 
addition, [CONTACT_200445] an Cestari will function as the  Medical Monitor. The Medical Monitor will 
provide oversight and be responsible for reporting the findings of the DSMC to the  PHRC.  
The DSMC will meet in an open session with select investigators prior to enrollment opening to  
review the protocol, objectives of the DSMC, and the plans for the DSMC throughout the course 
of the study. Following this open session, the DSMC will convene on an annual basis to review 
the data derived from the trial in a masked fashion.  
The annual mee ting of the DSMC will allow members to review the ongoing progress of the 
study and safety of the participants. From this information, the DSMC will make 
recommendations to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_200405].  
The DSMC will review masked cumulative participant data in order to assess the integrity o f the 
study. Specifically the DSM C will be asked to evaluate the data integrity, participant safety and 
scientific validity. Site summaries of patient rec ruitment, retention rates, data quality and 
completeness, protocol deviations, unanticipated events and adverse events will be shared with 
the DSMC to allow for a complete assessment. Data will be shared in a masked fashion with 
interventions coded as eith er A or B. If for any reason the DSMC requires unmasking of data to 
further evaluate safety parameters, it will be provided to them. The DSMC also can request an 
interim analysis if deemed necessary.  
Following each meeting , the DSMC Chair , on behalf of the  DSMC, will provide a

13.2 Data Management  
13.2.1. Identifiers  
Each site will be given a unique site identification (ID) number. This number will precede each 
subject specific identification number to create a unique code for each participant. This code will 
then be included in the subject’s electronic file within StudyTrax a nd ascribed to all data within 
the system to maintain subject confidentiality.  
 
13.2.2. Confidentiality  
All enrolling sites will maintain their site -specific study subject files within StudyTrax. Only 
appropriate study personnel at each site will be given access to StudyTrax with a unique 
username [CONTACT_2383]. In addition, the program allows for multiple levels of access providing 
added security.  
The subject identification process described above allows MEEI personnel the ability to review 
files for data i ntegrity and safety while maintaining the confidentiality of the study subjects.  
Corneal photographs and OCT images from each site will be shared with coordinating center via 
secure email . All images will contain no identifiers except for the unique subjec t ID. The trial 
Image Analyst, will have access to each image through DropBox (Partners Healthcare account) 
allowing for confidential and masked retrieval of all study images.  
Representatives from the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command ( [LOCATION_003]MRMC ) are 
eligible to review study records. No sensitive information is being collected for this study.  
  
13.2.3. Disposition of Data  
All subject data will be stored within StudyTrax. MEE will be the primary administrator for this 
study in StudyTrax. StudyTrax is hosted within a secure network. The data within StudyTrax

Page [ADDRESS_239250] notoriously poor correlations with  
human clinical outcomes.  
Initially, we worked on determining the optimal riboflavin/UVA cross -linking method to 
increase resistance of the corneas to enzymatic degradation ex -vivo. 
The methodology was as follows. The corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_200386] a 57 blade. The corneas with 2 -3mm 
scleral rims were excised and their irises were removed. They were fitted into Barron® artificial 
anterior chambers with the endothelium bathed in i sotonic saline solution. The VEGA® LED -
based UVA emitter was switched on for at least 30 minutes prior to calibration then was 
calibrated before the experiments. The corneas were then pre -treated with 0.1% riboflavin/20% 
dextran T500 every 2 -3 minutes for 15 minutes followed by [CONTACT_200410] ( λ= 370nm, irradiation = 
3mW/cm2) at a fixed distance of 54mm from the top of the corneas for 5 -minute intervals, while 
applying riboflavin between irradiations. Either the anterior stroma (A) or the anterior (A) and 
posterior stroma (P) was irradiated for different durations (7.5A, 7.5A/7.5P, 15A, 15A/15P, 30A, 
30A/30P and 60A minutes). The primary control was no riboflavin/no UVA. Secondary controls 
included riboflavin/no UVA and UVA/no riboflavin. The corneas were trephined into 8.5 -mm 
buttons and incubat ed in clean glass vials containing 0.3% collagenase A solutions at 37°C and 
rotating at 150 rotations -per-minute. The time to total dissolution of the corneas was measured. 
Each group included 4 or more corneas.  
Results showed that the primary control diss olved at 4.8h ±0.8 while tissue cross -linked for 15 
minutes dissolved after 50.0 +/ - 8.1 hours. Compared to the control, there was a marked increase 
in resistance to degradation for all UVA/riboflavin cross -linked corneas. In general, anterior 
stromal cros s-linking was superior to anterior/posterior stromal cross -linking (whether the 
irradiation time was split or doubled between the anterior and posterior stromata compared to 
their matched groups of anteriorly cross -linked corneas). The minimal treatment th at yielded the 
greatest resistance in all groups was 15 minutes of anterior stromal cross -linking (50.0h 
 8.1; 
p<0.0001).  The results were similar for 15, 30, and 60 minutes of cross -linking. Therefore, we 
identified several methods to increase the cornea l resistance to enzymatic degradation using the 
corneal cross- linking technique.  
The UVA emitter emits constant irradiation energy of 3mW/cm2 that requires the UVA light 
source to be at 54mm from the cross -linked cornea. The irradiated area can be controll ed using

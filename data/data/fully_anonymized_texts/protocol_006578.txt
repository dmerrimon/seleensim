 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 38 
Drug, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
SnPP is supplied as  a sterile liquid in vials for intravenous (IV) injection and intended for single 
use. Glass vials are plugged with Teflon -coated rubber stoppers and sealed with aluminum seals. 
Vials of  5 mL will be used  for each cohort . 
SnPP at a dose of either 9 mg SnPP, 27 mg SnPP,  or 90 mg SnPP will be administered on SD  1. 
The infusions will  be given using a syringe pump over a 120-minute period.  
Rationale for the Dose and Schedule Selection:  
The proposed SnPP doses and administration schedules are based on previous human studies with SnPP and preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data. The proposed starting dose of 9 mg SnPP is 1/ 10 the NOA EL in rats and 1/36 th e NOAEL in dogs 
based on body surface scaling 
in accordance with the conversion factors in Appendix A of the Guidance for Industry 
Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in 
Adult Healthy Volunteers (2005)  and a human body weight of 60 kg, and has previously 
been administered safely to human subjects.  
Study Duration:  
Study duration is for [ADDRESS_73642] . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Biomarkers 
• Key parameters: Haptoglobin, F erritin , Hemopexin, IL-10, H eme O xygenase 1 (HO -1) 
and B ilirubin . Urine samples will be collected and centrifuged and analyzed for subject 
responsiveness to SnPP therapy. 
• Additional secondary parameters: P21   
Pharmacodynamic/ Safety parameters  
• Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, Cystatin -C, Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ( KIM -1), 
Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), albuminuria, N acetyl -beta-D-
glucosaminidase (NAG),  liver enzymes and troponin I at regular intervals  
• Adverse events, serious adverse events, suspected adverse reactions, and serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions  
• Laboratory safety data, vital signs, and temperature at regular intervals  
Pharmacokinetics  
• SnPP on SD 1  
Study Hypothesis:  
It is hypothesized that SnPP  is safe and well tolerated up to the top dose of 90 mg SnPP. It is also 
hypothesized that SnPP  will modulate  biomarker levels in a dose -related fashion.  
Statistical Considerations  
Sample Size : No formal sample size calculation has been performed for this phase 1b study. 
However, it is believed that six  subject s per dose group in the healthy volunteer cohorts (3) and 
the CKD  stages 3 & 4  cohorts (2  each ) will be adequate to establish POC based on biomarker 
response and identify an optimal dose for further testing, recognizing that a battery of different surrogate biomarkers will be evaluated  
Analysis Populations and General Methodology:  All subjects who receive study medication 
will be included in the Safety population for safety analysis. Subject s who receive study 
medication and have a post -baseline efficacy assessment will be included in the Modified Intent-Renibus Therapeutics, Inc., RBT-1 IND 138109, SN 0008

to-Treat (MITT) population for efficacy analysis. All subject  data will be listed. When  
appropriate, summary statistics will be provided (number of non- missing values, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables) by [CONTACT_67485], including demographic and baseline assessments, safety, and efficacy endpoints. Baseline for all safety and efficacy endpoints is defined as the last observations before administration of the first IV infusion of study drug. No imputation will be used for missing data. 
Safety Analysis:  Safety measures including AEs, infusion- related reactions, clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs, physical exams, and concomitant medication usage will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_67486], where appropriate.  Biomarker Analysis:  Biomarker response will be summarized by [CONTACT_67487], comparing change from baseline at  2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 hours after start of 
infusion . 
Percent change from baseline will be analyzed using the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The between -group comparison will be performed using the simple contrast at 2, 4, 8, 
12, 18, 24, 48, 72, [ADDRESS_73643]-dosing In addition to absolute and percent changes from baseline, a r esponder analysis will also be 
considered. The responder definition and its appropriate analysis methodology will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. Exploratory analysis using Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_67488]. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic parameters of each treatment group will  be 
estimated using a non-compartmental analy sis following completion of each dose and prior to 
dose escalation .  The maximum serum concentration (C max) and time to maximum serum 
concentration (Tmax) will be obtained directly from the data. The elimination rate constant (λz), 
elimination half -life (T ½), area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to time t (AUC [0-t]) 
and area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC [0-inf]), clearance (CL), 
and volume of distribution (Vz) will be calculated for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. The renal excretion and renal clearance (CL) of tin will al so be calculated.  
A compartmental model may be fit to the data if appropriate and used to predict plasma 
concentration -time profiles for other doses and regimens

6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background Information 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt loss of kidney function in which the body accumulates 
waste products and is unable to maintain electrolyte, acid -base, and water balance [ Tögel 2014 ]. 
It is a major risk factor for morbidity, mortality, and  the development of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) [ Goldberg 2009, Ishani 2009, Liangos 2006, Wald 2009, Xue 2006 ].  A meta -analysis of 
[ADDRESS_73647] s of 21.6% and 23.9%, respectively 
[Susantitaphong 2013 ]. In cardiac surgery subject s, the incidence of postoperative AKI is 
approximately 30% and significantly increases the risk of death after cardiac surgery [ Rosner 
2006 ]. Progression to advanced- stage CKD  within 24 months occurs in approximately 15 to 20% 
of subject s who survive AKI [ Chawla 2012 ]. 
Many different types of exposure may cause AKI; however, the chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_67468] a number of susceptibility factors that vary widely among individual 
subject s [Kellum 2013 ].  Sepsis, critical illness, circulatory shock, burns, trauma, cardiac surgery 
(particularly with cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]), major non-cardiac surgery, nephrotoxic drugs, 
radiocontrast agents, and poisonous plants and animals are all recognized as causes of 
AKI.   Susceptibility factors that increase a subject’s risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_67469], advanced age, female gender, Black race, chronic kidney disease, chronic 
disease (heart, lung, liver), diabetes mellitus, cancer, and anemia.  AKI can lead to a number of 
complications, including metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, uremia, changes in body fluid 
balance, an d effects on other organ systems, including need for dialysis and possibly death. 
People who have experienced AKI have an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_67470]. The annual cost to the US health care s ystem is 
estimated at approximately $15B  [Silver 2017 ]. 
The diagnosis of AKI is based on the following criteria introduced by [CONTACT_67490]: 
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI Work Group in 2012 [ KDIGO 2012 ]: increase in 
serum creatinine ≥  0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours ; or increase in serum creatinine ≥  1.[ADDRESS_73648] occurred within the prior 7 days; or urine volume 
< 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours. The ma nagement of AKI is purely symptomatic, with the aim of 
limiting damage and preventing further loss of function. No pharmacologic therapy is approved 
for the treatment or prevention of AKI. 
It has long been recognized that after an initial ischemic or toxic  injury, the kidney develops 
marked resistance to subsequent damage [ Honda 1987, Zager 1984, Zager 1995a , Zager 1995b , 
Zager 1995c ]. This phenomenon, which is mediated in part by [CONTACT_67491]- inflammatory stress proteins (e .g., heme oxygenase 1 [HO-1], ferritin, 
haptoglobin, hemopexin, alpha 1 antitrypsin, interleukin 10 [IL -10]), has been referred to as 
“ischemic preconditioning” or “acquired cytoresistance.” This phenomenon could be used in a 
clinical setting to preemptively protect organs, especially when a known insult is approaching. Renibus Therapeutics, Inc., RBT-1 IND 138109, SN 0008

6.2 Study Drug  
A pharmacological intervention with the ability to stimulate the kidney’s natural protective 
pathways to prevent AKI would represent a significant medical advance. SnPP is under 
development as a prophylactic agent to induce cytoresistance in organs when a known insult is 
immin ent. The initial target for development is the kidneys and prevention of AKI.  However, 
the phenomenon of acquired cytoresistance is also relevant to other bodily organs such as the 
heart and liver, and will be the focus of extended development of SnPP in combination with 
other agents, more specifically, Iron Sucrose (FeS .) 
Stannous protoporphyrin, a potent competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase activity, is not 
commercially available,  a 45 mg dose has been safely administered to healthy volunteers 
[Anderson 1986, Berglund 1988, Emtestam 1993 ], term newborns with hyperbilirubinemia 
[Kappas  1988 ], and adult subject s with hepatic dysfunction affecting heme metabolism or 
bilirubin conjugation [ Anderson 1986, Berglund 1990]  or porphyria [ Dover 1993, Galbraith 
1989 ]. 
6.[ADDRESS_73649] been conducted and are detailed in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.  Single -extended acute dose toxicity studies of intravenous SnPP 
demonstrated no- adverse -effect -levels of  10 mg/kg SnPP in the rat (human equivalent does of 96 
mg) and the dog (human equivalent dose of 324 mg).   
6.4 Clinical Experience 
Safety data from intravenous SnPP administration at doses up to 3 mg/kg has shown 
photosensitivity in subjects when exposed to sunlight or UV-A light following dosing [ Anderson 
1986 , Berglund 1990, Dover 1993, Galbraith 1989, Kap pas 1988 ].  No other adverse effects of 
SnPP administration have been consistently reported in the literature.

Because the investigator is knowledgeable about the human subject (e.g., medical history, concomitant medications), administers the investigational drug, monitors the subject’s response to the drug, is aware of the subject’s clinical state and thus may be sensitive to  distinctions 
between events due to an underlying disease process versus events that may be drug- related, and 
may have observed the event, the investigator must include an assessment of causality (i.e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that the dr ug caused the event) in the report to Renibus 
Therapeutics, Inc Copi[INVESTIGATOR_67474], Inc. will be kept in the 
investigator’s study file.  
The investigator is responsible for complying with their IRB’s requirements for reporting serious 
adverse events . Any expedited safety report (i .e., serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction) 
received from Renibus Therapeutics, Inc. should be submitted to the IRB. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_67475]’s study file.  
The investigator must record non-serious adverse events in the eCRF and report them to Sponsor according to the timetable for reporting (e .g., end of study) . The investigator’s assessment of 
causality is not required for non- serious adverse events. 
10.2 Definitions  
Adverse Event:   Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use 
of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An adverse event  can be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
Adverse Reaction:   Adverse reaction  means any adverse event  definitely caused by [CONTACT_33641]. 
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which 
there is a “reasonable possibility” (i .e., evidence indefinite but suggests a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event ) that the drug caused the adverse event. By [CONTACT_108] , a 
suspected adverse reaction is identical to the definition of adverse drug reaction per ICH E2A. Renibus Therapeutics, Inc., RBT-1 IND 138109, SN 0008
Protocol Number: REN -003 (Original)  
Date: [ADDRESS_73678] a causal relationship: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., a ngioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome) 
• One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture) 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (e.g., known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group. 
Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event  or adverse 
reaction  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator bro chure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
Adverse event s or adverse reactions that are mentioned as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug will be considered “unexpected” if they are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. Until the investigator brochure is updated to include a new serious suspected adverse reaction , 
subsequent occurrences of similar serious suspected adverse reactions  must be submitted 
expeditiously to FDA in IND Safety Reports  and to other appropriate regulatory authorities in 
countries other than the US in an Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) or using a Council for International Organizations of M edical Sciences (CIOMS) I form, as appropriate. 
Serious Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event  or adverse reaction  is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• In subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
If either the investigator or Sponsor believes that the event is serious, it must be evaluated by [CONTACT_67501]. Life-Threatening Adverse Event or Life- Threatening Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event  or 
suspected adverse reaction  is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Renibus , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  Renibus Therapeutics, Inc., RBT-1 IND 138109, SN 0008

Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, and it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed, and it results in any of the serious outcomes listed above. This criterion is consistent with the concepts of FDA 21  Code of F ederal Regulation (CFR) [ADDRESS_73679] notify the appropriate regulato ry authority(ies) and all participating 
investigators in an expedited safety report (e.g., IND Safety Report or ICRS) of potentially 
serious risks from clinical trials or any other source (i.e., a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction), as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after Renibus Therapeutics, Inc.  
receives the safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
During the course of drug development, the Sponsor may become aware of new safety information from a variety of sources and will decide if an individual case of a serious and unexpected adverse event meets the criteria for reporting to regulatory authorities. If the adverse event does not meet all criteria (i .e., reasonable possibility of causality, serious and 
unexpected), it should not be submitted as an expedited s afety r eport.  
Any unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reaction must be reported to 
regulatory authorities no later than 7 calendar days after Renibus Therapeutics, Inc. receives the safety information. 
10.3 Breaking the Blind  
Not applicable as this is an open label study. 
11  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section outlines the nature and rationale for the statistical methods to be used for the analysis of the data from the study. A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will describe data 
handling and statistical techniques in full detail.  
11.[ADDRESS_73680] s. No imputation will be used for missing data. 
11.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline variables that will be summarized by [CONTACT_67502]:  
• Demographics   
• Medical history  
• Complete PE  
• Efficacy and Safety variables including vital signs and laboratory tests, including chemistry, hematology, and ur inalysis obtained at Screening.  Renibus Therapeutics, Inc., RBT-1 IND 138109, SN 0008

11.3 Analysis of Efficacy Endpoint s 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize Response biomarker results at baseline, each 
visit, and the change from baseline for each visit. Percent change from baseline will be analyzed using the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). In this analysis, percent change from baseline at each post treatment time point will 
be the response variable; treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed factors , 
patient as repeated me asure unit over visits , and baseline as covariate. The between -group 
comparison will be performed using the simple contrast at 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, [ADDRESS_73681]-dosing.  In addition to the percent changes from baseline, absolute change from baseline will also be 
analyzed using MMRM. Moreover, a responder analysis will also be considered. The 
responder definition and its appropriate analysis methodology will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. Exploratory analysis using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test 
stratified by [CONTACT_67488].  
11.4 Analysis of Pharmacodynamic/ Safety  Endpoints  
The evaluation of safety will include adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, physic al examinations, and ECGs.  
The principle of treatment emergence will be employed for the analysis of adverse event data. A Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined to be any event that occurs during the observation period of the study and was not present at baseline, or exacerbation of a condition present at baseline.   
TEAEs will be classified by [CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA). The type, incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of adverse events will be reported for treatment -emergent and serious adverse events. Reasons for withdrawal due to 
adverse events will also be reported.   Descriptive statistics, including mean, mean change from baseline, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median , will be presented for laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG 
parameters. The numbers and percentages of subjects with treatment-emergent laboratory, vital sign, and ECG values that meet Sponsor- defined potentially clinically significant criteria will b e 
summarized. Categorical (low, normal, and high relative to the normal range) shifts from baseline will be summarized with the number and percentage of subjects for laboratory parameters . 
All safety data will be displayed in listings.  
11.5 Analysis of Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  Data  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be calculated for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_1570] . PK profiles in which the pre-dose concentration is > 5% of the corresponding 
C
max (and therefore greater than the lower limit of quanti fication [L LOQ ]) will be excluded from 
all descriptive statistics and statistical analyses.  
For the PK analysis performed, actual blood sampling times will be used in all PK  analyses. 
Protocol- specified times will be used to calculate mean plasma or serum concentrations for Renibus Therapeutics, Inc., RBT-1 IND 138109, SN 0008
Protocol Number: REN -003 (Original)  
Date: [ADDRESS_73682] plasma 
or serum concentration versus time graphs will be performed using SAS®. 
PK parameters will be calculated using non- compartmental analysis. The maximum serum 
concentration (C max) and time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) will be obtained directly 
from the data. The elimination rate constant (λz), elimination half -life (T ½), area under the 
concentration -time curve from time 0 to time t (AUC [0-t]) and area under the concentration- time 
curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC [0-inf]), clearance (CL), and volume of distribution (Vz) will be 
calculated for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_19021].. Only plasma samples with 
concentrations ≥ L LOQ will be used in the PK  analysis. Plasma concentrations < L LOQ will be 
taken as 0 for the calculation of the descriptive statistics at each sampling time. For the PK  
analysis, plasma concentratio ns < L LOQ that occur from pre -dose to the first concentration 
≥ LLOQ will be taken as [ADDRESS_73683] cohort. The 
subsequent decisions to escalate to the next dose level will be based on the available pharmacokinetic exposure data from the previous dose cohort(s) and compared with the exposure level s at the NOAEL established in the acute dose toxicity study in male and female Sprague 
Dawley rats.  The dose escalation decision will utilize best available modelling practices, i.e. fitting the power model to the individual subject Cmax and AUC vs. dose.  A dose will not be 
administered that would result in an upper 95
th percentile for the model -predicted Cmax and AUC 
values exceeding 39,250 ng/mL and 209,500 hr.ng/mL (mean of males and females), respectively. These values were the observed values at the NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day in the GLP toxicology 
study performed in Sprague Dawley rats.

procedures) will be made . All treated subjects (those who have received at least [ADDRESS_73686]) will be included in the ITT and s afety analyses.  
In the unlikely event the Sponsor or FDA should determine it is appropriate to terminate the study early, every effort will be made for transitioning subjects with minimal disruption to the subject and investigator. The IRB will be notified of termination, and reason(s) and procedures 
for follow -up of research subjects will be developed by [CONTACT_67504].

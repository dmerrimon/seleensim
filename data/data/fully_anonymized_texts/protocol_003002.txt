Title An Open Label Single Arm Phase I/II study of MTX110 delivered by 
[CONTACT_174734]-enhanced delivery (CED) in patients with diffuse intrinsic 
pontine glioma (DIPG) previously treated with external beam 
radiation therapy
Patient population Children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
(DIPG), previously treated with focal radiotherapy.
Rationale for Study The overall median survival of children with DIPG is approximately [ADDRESS_203945] delivery via convection-enhanced delivery 
(CED) of MTX110 will increase progression-free and overall survival 
in children with newly diagnosed DIPG following standard of care 
radiotherapy. This trial will assess the safety and preliminary efficacy 
of this strategy.
Primary Objective To determine the safety and tolerability of repeated administration of 
MTX110 co-infused with gadoteridol given by [CONTACT_174736]. 
Secondary Objective To determine the clinical efficacy of repeated administration of 
MTX110 given by [CONTACT_174737] a phase I/II study.
Exploratory 
Objectives To assess the magnetic resonance image-guided intracranial 
injection procedure in patients with DIPG by [CONTACT_174738]-treatment modeling of 
the drug distribution utilizing predictive imaging software.
To assess Quality of Life (QOL) in pediatric patients with newly 
diagnosed DIPG treated with MTX110 co-infused with gadoteridol 
given by [CONTACT_174739].
To perform central review of imaging to explore MR qualitative 
and quantitative measures as markers of disease response and/or 
progression and treatment effect in comparison to institutional 
evaluation of disease response and/or progression.

Version date 06/20/2019 7 Version 2.0Study Design This is an open-label, ascending dose, single arm phase I/II study of 
MTX110 delivered by [CONTACT_174740]. We will start with a single dose drug 
concentration of 30 M using a total volume of 3mL and administer 
MTX110 on day 1 only; we will then first dose escalate by [CONTACT_174741]110 is given: 30 M concentration, 3 ml total volume, 
administration will occur on day 1 and 2. We then will start to dose 
escalate the total volume that is being administered on days 1 and 2. 
Once the RP2D total volume has been determined, we will then 
escalate the concentration of MTX110 that is being administered on 
days 1 and 2. The accelerated dose escalation design will allow intra-
patient dose escalation. The concentration of gadoteridol (ProHance) 
will be 0.5 mM which is the same concentration that is being used for 
other PNOC studies; both agents will be combined and co-infused via 
the same catheters. A maximum of 2 catheters will be placed. 
Number of patients The number of subjects enrolled will depend upon the DLTs observed 
and the number of dose levels tested as the study progresses in 
accordance with an accelerated dose escalation design (ATD) 
followed by a 3+3 design. The ATD is expected to enroll 1 to 7 
subjects with a minimum of 5 patients in the 3+[ADDRESS_203946] 
focal radiotherapy (minimum of 28 days, maximum of 14 weeks from 
radiation therapy). Treatment will occur every 4-8 weeks. Treatment 
will continue for up to 24 months or until tumor progression or 
intolerable toxicity. If subjects continue to derive clinical benefit, 
discussion with investigators and study sponsor will determine 
feasibility and clinical appropriateness to continue therapy beyond 24 
months.
Duration of Follow 
upAll subjects will be followed for safety, time to tumor progression and 
overall survival. 
Duration of study The study will reach completion approximately 3 years from the time 
the study opens to accrual.
Study Drugs MTX110 is a water soluble formulation of panobinostat, administered 
via CED; concentration of gadoteridol (ProHance) will be 0.5 mM in 
all dose levels; both agents will be combined and co-infused via the 
same catheters.
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 8 Version 2.0Safety Assessments We will use CTCAE version 4.0 for adverse event reporting; surgical 
complications will be graded as outlined in the protocol. Subjects will 
undergo clinical evaluation and brain MR imaging prior to any CED 
to assess for related toxicity, as well as tumor status. Toxicity is 
defined per standard pediatric phase I guidelines including 
interruption of planned therapy > 10 weeks to allow for recovery from 
toxicity of prior CED MTX110 injection. 
Efficacy Assessments We will assess the preliminary efficacy using overall survival at 12 
months (OS12) in 19 evaluable DIPG patients treated within the 
expansion cohort which will include subjects treated as part of the 
dose escalation portion of the trial on the recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D). The most recent Children’s Oncology Group study that 
treated children newly diagnosed with DIPG with a combination of 
radiation therapy and temozolomide resulted in an OS12 rate of 40% 
(SD ± 6.5%). A sample size of 19 patients achieves 80% power to 
detect a difference of 30% using a one sided exact binominal test. The 
target significance level is 5% and the actual significance level is 
3.5% with this test. If 12 or more patients are alive at 12 months, the 
null hypothesis that OS12 is 40% will be rejected.
Unique Aspects of 
this StudyThis is the first study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of 
the use of repeated CED of MTX110 with real time gadoteridol 
imaging in children with DIPG.
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_203947] completed focal radiotherapy (to begin treatment ≥ 28 days to ≤ 14 weeks from completion 
of radiation therapy). Enrollment occurs after completion of radiation therapy.
We will assess an anticipated 7 dose levels using an accelerated, intra-patient dose escalation 
scheme: 
Dose level 1: Single CED of 30 M MTX110 on 1 day (day 1); Total volume 3 mL
Dose level 2: Repeated CED of 30 M MTX110 on 2 consecutive days (days 1, 2); Total volume 6 mL (3 
mL on each day)
Dose level 3: Repeated CED of 30 M MTX110 on 2 consecutive days (days 1, 2); Total volume 8 mL (4 
mL day on each day)
Dose level 4: Repeated CED of 30 M MTX110 on 2 consecutive days (days 1, 2); Total volume 10 mL (5 
mL day on each day)
Dose level 5: Repeated CED of 30 M MTX110 on 2 consecutive days (days 1, 2); Total volume 12 mL (6 
mL day on each day)
Dose level 6: Repeated CED of 60 M MTX110 on 2 consecutive days (days 1, 2); Total volume 12 mL (6 
mL day on each day)
Dose level 7: Repeated CED of 90 M MTX110 on 2 consecutive days (days 1, 2); Total volume 12 mL (6 
mL day on each day)
Once these dose levels have been assessed, a detailed review of the safety and efficacy data will 
be performed and the study team will discuss with the FDA and the DSMC to determine either 
further dose escalation or enrollment into the phase II study.
**Of note, timing of follow-up day 2 infusion will be determined pending patient’s return to pre-infusion 
baseline neurological exam or equal or less than grade 1 toxicities, but will occur no later than 48 hours after 
completion of infusion on day 1; if patient’s neurological exam has not returned to pre-infusion baseline by 48 
hours from completion of day 1 infusion, day 2 CED procedure will be canceled.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Convection Enhanced Delivery
CED is a delivery modality which utilizes bulk flow, or fluid convection, established as a result 
of a pressure gradient rather than a concentration gradient [1]. Through the maintenance of such 
a pressure gradient from the delivery cannula tip to the surrounding tissues, CED is able to 
distribute small and large molecules to clinically significant target volumes (centimeters rather 
than millimeters) [1, 2]. Small or large particles are easily distributed within the brain via CED 
[3, 4]. The advantages of CED over diffusion based delivery include: (i) an expanded volume of 
distribution (Vd); (ii) a uniform concentration of the infused therapeutic within the target Vd; 
(iii) the delivery of the vast majority of the infused therapeutic within the target volume [2]. 
CED distribution is enhanced by [CONTACT_174745]’s perivascular spaces [5]. 
Additionally, an improved understanding of the complexities of the extracellular matrix and its 
effects on convection has led to better distribution [6-8]. For example, technical CED infusion 
parameters, such as cannula size and shape, infusion rate (usually 0.2–5.0 μL/min or 0.012–0.3 
mL/h), infusate concentration, and tissue sealing time, have been defined and refined to improve 
distribution of study agents while limiting potential toxicities and morbidities [9-11]. 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 15 Version 2.0A major advance in the safe and potentially efficacious use of CED in neurosurgery has been the 
development of real-time convective delivery (RCD), which utilizes magnetic resonance imaging 
to visualize the CED process with the aid of co-convected contrast agents [11-16]. The use of 
RCD allows physicians to directly monitor the distribution of therapeutics within the brain. Thus, 
reflux along the CED catheter or leakage outside the target area, especially at higher flow rates, 
can be monitored and corrective steps taken, such as retargeting the catheter or altering the rate 
of infusion [17, 18]. RCD techniques will be used in this study –which represents an important 
advancement because several recent clinical trials that utilized CED for the delivery of 
therapeutics to the brain, but which lacked effective imaging monitoring, did not meet clinical 
endpoints, including trials for treatment of neurodegenerative disease, and neoplastic conditions 
[19-24].
These clinical trials have demonstrated the promise of CED as a therapeutic option for patients 
with recurrent high grade gliomas with a relatively low toxicity profile associated with therapy. 
Clinical Neuro-Oncologic Studies 
Although a large number of therapeutic options have been examined for CED, only a few agents 
have been formally studied in clinical trials. Some of the more prominent clinical trials studying 
CED include: TP‐38, cintredekin besudotox, IL‐4 pseudomonas exotoxin, paclitaxel, AP [ZIP_CODE], 
and cotara. 
Sampson et al. used CED infusion of TP‐38 which is a chimeric protein that fuses TGF‐α with a 
genetically modified Pseudomonas exotoxin. Overall survival was 28 weeks with a subset 
survival of 33 weeks in the 20 patients with no residual disease and 20.1 weeks in patients with 
residual disease [25]. There was one patient that at the time of publication had a survival of 260 
weeks. The toxicities with TP‐38 included 5 patients with seizures who had previous seizure 
disorders. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was seen in 2 patients [26]. 
Cintredekin besudotox was tested in [ADDRESS_203953] ‐treatment, 
with 9 patients exhibiting progression free survival for 1 year and seven patients with 
progression free survival of 2 years [27]. There were grade 3 or 4 toxicities reported with 
headache, convulsion, and hemiparesis; six patients developed hemiparesis. A phase III trial was 
completed for cintredekin besudotox that was randomized against Gliadel wafers for recurrent 
GBM. The median survival was comparable between CED and Gliadel wafers at 36.4 weeks and 
35.3 weeks respectively. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_174694]‐administered therapy, inadequate drug distribution and improper catheter placement might 
explain the results [28].
A recombinant cytotoxin that is a fusion between IL ‐4 and Pseudomonas exotoxin was applied 
by [CONTACT_174746] a phase I clinical trial for recurrent gliomas [29]. When comparing the recombinant 
cytotoxin to resection alone the overall median survival of recurrent GBM was 5.8 months and 
5.3 months, respectively [25]. There were no noted systemic toxicities, and the most common 
adverse events were cerebral edema, seizures, and headaches.
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 16 Version 2.0For infusion of paclitaxel for recurrent grade III or IV gliomas, Lidar et al. demonstrated an 
overall median survival of 7.5 months. However, there was a significant number of treatment 
related adverse events including transient neurological deterioration from cerebral edema (20%), 
bacterial infections (15%), and chemical meningitis (30%) [30]. 
AP [ZIP_CODE], an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to TGF‐β2 mRNA to inhibit translation, was 
studied in three phase I/II clinical trials for CED that demonstrated a median overall survival of 
44 weeks for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 146.6 weeks for patients with anaplastic 
astrocytoma (AA) [31]. There were 29 treatment‐related toxicities, but these were mostly minor 
and limited to grade 2 and 3 toxicities.
Cotara, an immunotoxin with an antibody specific for histone H1‐DNA complex that was labeled 
with 131I, was studied in 51 patients enrolled in phase I and II studies. This treatment achieved a 
median survival in GBM patients of 37.9 weeks [32]. Eighteen patients had a grade 3 or 4 
neurological toxicity, while four patients had grade 3 systemic toxicities [2].
These clinical trials have demonstrated the promise of CED as a therapeutic option for patients 
with recurrent high grade gliomas with a relatively low toxicity profile associated with therapy. 
2.2 Real-time Imaging of Convection Enhanced Delivery (RCD)
The use of RCD in this trial will allow direct visualization of the study drug and improved 
estimation and standardization of the therapeutic contact [CONTACT_5586]. RCD will be used at the beginning 
of the infusion and then periodically throughout the infusion, depending on the estimated 
infusion time for each individual subject. With advancements in magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI), the technology now exists to allow for prospective, real-time imaging of the CED 
injection - which has the potential to ensure more accurate and consistent delivery of the full 
dose of drug to the tumor. MRI Interventions and BrainLab have developed FDA-approved, head 
coil, delivery catheters and skull fixation devices that are MRI compatible and allow for real-
time imaging of the CED injection. [CONTACT_174832] at Ohio State University has used the 
SmartFlow catheter (MRI Interventions) and ClearPoint MRI guided neuronavigation device 
(MRI Interventions) to deliver a biologic therapy into patients with brain stem glioma. [CONTACT_174833] at Memorial Sloan Kettering is using the flexible BrainLab catheter for CED for 
children with DIPG. The flexible BrainLab catheter allows longer infusion times compared to the 
SmartFlow catheter system. Gadolinium is added to the study drug to allow for RCD. Prior work 
has shown that gadoteridol (ProHance®) is biocompatible with the MTX110 and can be safely 
injected in combination into the tumors of study subjects. Further, [CONTACT_174834] has shown 
that this approach is safe and feasible in non-human primates when infused to midline structures 
of the brain including the brainstem (unpublished data, please see below for more detail). 
Gadolinium-based contrast agents are not approved for intracerebral administration, although the 
enhancement seen on standard gadolinium-MRI exams is the result of gadolinium leaking from 
tumor vessels into the surrounding cerebral tissues. Nonionic gadolinium-based contrast agents 
have been safely administered intrathecally at 0.[ADDRESS_203954] CSF leaks. Gadolinium has also 
been administered intracerebrally to patients in two studies using CED [16].

for compatibility. ProHance® contains 279 mg/mL of gadolinium and during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_174695], a 70 kg man would receive approximately 3,906 mg of gadolinium. 
In this study a maximum of 0.03 mL of ProHance® of a 1:10 dilution will be added to 3.0mL of 
MTX110 yielding <1.0 mg/mL of gadolinium. 
Pre-clinical Neuro-Oncologic Studies 
CED has been used to effectively deliver therapy within the central nervous system (CNS) in 
small animals with or without tumors [4, 33-36], canines with spontaneous brain tumors [37, 38], 
and primates [11, 39]. In canines, similar CED-delivered agents failed to show clinical or 
pathological adverse effects in normal or brain tumor-bearing animals [37, 38], while confirming 
clinical efficacy and highlighting the importance of RCD to maximize tumor coverage and 
minimize inappropriate infusions. Convection of gadolinium liposomes (GDL) in nonhuman 
primate brain has confirmed the lack of toxicity and ability to monitor the infusion process in a 
larger brain using RCD methods similar to those for humans [11, 40]. Recently, in vivo CED of 
magnetic nanospheres conjugated to an antibody that selectively binds to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] (EGFR) mutant (EGFRvIII) found on glioblastoma xenografts, not only allowed 
specific tumor visualization on MRI, but through an apoptotic mechanism, was associated with 
targeted cell death with sparing of normal astrocytes [41] .
These and other preclinical data [42] argue for the importance of a delivery platform [17] that 
utilizes RCD to monitor therapeutic distribution and potential complications associated with 
CED in the brain tumor patient [18]. 
2.3 Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), CED, MTX110
Gliomas are the most common brain tumor type in children. High-grade gliomas (HGG), 
including anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) and glioblastomas (GBM), are the most aggressive 
gliomas with 5-year survival rates of less than 20% in the pediatric population. If these tumors 
occur within the pons – diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) – the expected outcomes are 
even worse, with a median survival of approximately [ADDRESS_203955] children die of their disease within a 
very short timeframe on the order of months. One prior study reported an event-free survival 
(EFS) defined as the time from progression to time of death, clinical deterioration or imaging 
based progression to be 2 months [43]; however published data on progression free survival 
(PFS) or EFS for progressive DIPGs is limited. Clearly new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174696].
One of the reasons for treatment failure is the presence of an intact blood-brain and blood-tumor 
barrier, with tight packing of cellular structures within the brainstem. These anatomic barriers are 
a significant obstacle to the effective delivery of many small-molecule drugs and most biological 
therapeutics. As mentioned above, CED utilizes a pressure gradient to distribute pharmacologic 
agents by [CONTACT_174748]. CED markedly improves drug

Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_203956] tumorigenesis
DNA and histones provide the main building blocks for nucleosomes, the structural units of 
chromatin that are important for packaging DNA. Changes in the structural configuration of 
chromatin to a relatively active (open) or inactive (condensed) form alters the accessibility of 
DNA for transcription, ultimately affecting gene expression. One of the major ways that 
transcription factor binding to DNA is regulated is through changes in chromatin conformation, 
which in turn is governed by [CONTACT_174749]. These changes are under the control of opposing 
activities of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone acetylase (HAT), and lead to altered gene 
expression, including genes involved in cell cycle regulation, differentiation and apoptosis. 
Acetylation is generally linked to an ‘open’ chromatin state that is ready for transcription or that 
corresponds to actively transcribed genomic regions, whereas deacetylation is associated with a 
closed or inactive state, leading to gene repression. The relative degree of histone acetylation and 
deacetylation therefore controls the level at which a gene is transcribed. HDAC also has crucial 
roles in cell cycle proliferation and apoptosis, including transcription factors such as p53, NF-kB 
and E2F1, which play key roles in tumorigenesis and anti-tumor response, as well as proteins 
that do not directly regulate gene expression but instead regulate DNA repair (Ku70), the cellular 
cytoskeleton (a-tubulin) and protein stabilization (Hsp90). Notably, among non-histone HDAC 
substrates, Hsp90 plays a major role in the proper folding and stability of several major 
oncoproteins. HDAC activity also regulates cell protein turnover via the aggresome pathway, 
which if disrupted, results in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein 
aggregates, leading to cell stress and caspase-dependent apoptosis. These observations have 
extended the mechanism of anti-tumor activity of panobinostat and other HDAC inhibitors to 
include effects on non-histone proteins, implicated in multiple oncogenic pathways, in 
conjunction with epi[INVESTIGATOR_14364][44].
Targets of MTX110, Histone 3.[ADDRESS_203957] prevalent molecular alterations of pediatric HGGs involve recurrent alterations of 
genes regulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_174697][45, 46]. Genome-wide studies have 
identified recurrent hotspot mutations in histone H3, family 3A (H3F3A) and histone cluster 1, 
H3b (HIST1H3B), which encode the histone H3 variants H3.[ADDRESS_203958] revealed that malignant gliomas in children often show recurrent missense 
mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3.[45, 47, 
48] Approximately 70% of DIPG [49] cases harbor a mutation which results in a substitution of 
the amino-acid lysine (K) to methionine (M) at position 27 of H3.3 (K27M mutation, hereafter), 
which is associated with shorter survival in DIPG patients compared with patients with non-
mutated H3.3[49].This was the first example of a human tumor driven by [CONTACT_174750] a 
histone gene. Point mutations of H3F3A  and HIST1H3B genes occur at hotspots at amino acid 
residue 27 resulting in lysine to methionine (K27M) amino acid change. Mutations lead to 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_203959] methylation signatures.[50, 51] Recent 
studies have shown that there also seems to be a difference between the two K27M mutations in 
that children harboring the H3.1K27M mutation have a worse clinical outcome compared to 
children with harboring the H3.3K27M.[49] K27M-mutated tumors are associated with the worst 
survival with a median overall survival of only [ADDRESS_203960] a specific mutation in a histone gene, H3K27M, 
which blocks the ability of methyltransferase to methylate histones. The panobinostat and similar 
gene-regulating drugs may be effective at treating DIPG. Using DIPG cell cultures from 16 
patients, Grasso et al screened 83 existing and potential cancer drugs and found that HDAC 
inhibitors consistently slowed cancer cell growth in DIPG cell lines, and inhibited DIPG growth 
and extended survival in a DIPG mouse model.[52]

Use of HDAC inhibition via panobinostat in oncology and in DIPG
Panobinostat (Farydak™) has been approved as a medicinal product for oral use in the US and 
EU for the treatment of multiple myeloma and has undergone extensive preclinical and clinical 
safety evaluation to support this indication. No panobinostat product suitable for direct brain 
delivery by [CONTACT_174751]. 
MTX110 is a novel, soluble, panobinostat formulation undergoing experimental evaluation for 
administration by [CONTACT_174752]. The safety evaluation program for 
MTX110 therefore focused on physicochemical characterisation of the formulation and 
toxicological evaluation of direct delivery of MTX110 into brain parenchyma by [CONTACT_174753]. 
The studies included: qualification of assays to quantify levels of panobinostat in plasma and 
brain tissue samples; confirmation of pharmacological potency as an inhibitor of HDAC, and as 
a cytotoxic agent in glioblastoma and DIPG cells; plasma and brain distribution, and toxicologic 
evaluation of MTX110 after CED delivery in rats and pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. 
Panobinostat (Farydak™) is currently being investigated in late phase clinical trials for adults 
with T cell lymphoma and has recently been approved in the US and EU for the use in adults 
with relapsed refectory myeloma. Systemic (oral) administration of panobinostat at effective 
doses in hematological malignancies, however, has been associated with significant toxicity – 
such as thrombocytopenia and cardiac toxicity. There is clinical evidence that panobinostat does 
not cross the blood brain barrier when given systemically at tolerated doses. It has been used to 
reactivate latent HIV in adult patients to facilitate the therapeutic effect of antiretroviral therapy 
to some following oral panobinostat administration. Panobinostat was not detectable in the CSF 
of these patients at any time point [53] .

For Group 1 rats (3 μM), the catheter tip was placed stereotactically into the brain stem. The 
solution was administered at a CED infusion rate of 1 μL/minute for 5 minutes (5 μL volume of 
infusion). For Group 2 rats (30 μM), and Group 3 rats (300 μM) the catheter tip was placed into 
the left striatum. Solutions were administered at a CED infusion rate of 2.5 μL/minute for 4 
minutes (10μL volume of infusion). 
Brain panobinostat concentrations are shown in Table 5. Concentrations were dose-related but 
increased sub-proportionally with increasing dose. Peak brain concentrations in the infused 
hemispheres of 1.9, 3.4 and 36.6 ng/g were measured for the 3, 30 and 300 μM solutions, 
respectively. If it is assumed that all drug is located within the convected tissue (assumed to be 
3x the infusion volume), the peak concentrations equate to concentrations in the convected tissue 
of 253, 227 and 2,440 ng/g, equating to approximately 0.7, 0.7 and 7 μM. At the 300 μM dose, 
brain concentration declined with time after convection with a tentative half-life of 2 to 3 hours.

lesions in the neuropil close to the aqueduct were seen in several animals. Similarly, there were 
linear lesions comprising focal vacuolation and astrocytosis with a macrophage infiltrate in the 
region of the cerebellar carbuncle and extending down towards the pontine nuclei. This area is 
very close to the 4th ventricle, an area that would have the potential to be a region where a 
relatively high concentration of the test item could be expected, but given the lack of a dosage 
relationship (the lesion was most pronounced in the animals given 1.0 μM MTX110), it was 
likely that this lesion was also procedural in nature. 
One rat in each of the 1 and 3 μM groups had small focal lesions of linear nature in the cerebellar 
lobules. These were similar in appearance with a localized loss of neurons, a macrophage 
infiltrate and a minimal astrocytosis and were consistent with localized trauma from the 
procedure; they were also considered to represent localized damage in the region of the needle 
path. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains clarified the nature of the lesions in the visual cortex 
and the other areas that were considered to be traumatic. The appearance was one of a focal loss 
of neurons, with the area having been populated by [CONTACT_174765] a reactive astrocytosis. The 
IHC stains indicated the lesions were a little more extensive than first appeared on the H and E 
sections. The appearance strongly suggested the lesions were related to the procedure following a

examination, and special stains were used to assess damage to specific cell types as follows: 
NeuN (neuronal cell specific marker), GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein, a glial cell specific 
marker), Fluorojade (neuronal degeneration stain) and IBA-1 (a microglia marker). 
Both MTX110-treated toxicology pi[INVESTIGATOR_174705]. Pig 2 recovered quickly over 24 hours, whereas Pig 1 had weakness in the right leg for 2 
days and in the left leg for 5 days after treatment. Hind edema was also noted in Pig 1, which 
partially responded to administration of non-steroidal analgesia. After detailed consultation with 
a veterinarian, the weakness was attributed to surgical positioning and prolonged anaesthesia 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 29 Version 2.0(approximately 6 hours) in this pig and not to MTX110, as such effects have been observed 
previously in animals undergoing extended anaesthesia. Eating and drinking in both animals was 
normal. There were no physiological signs of brain stem dysfunction in either pig. 
Histopathological examination of the pig killed after 7 days clearly showed the needle track in 
the sections, which included the thalamus and the pons. At this time-point there was 
haemorrhage and a cellular response that was GFAP negative and IBA-1 positive, indicating a 
macrophage/microglial response with no apparent astrocytosis (Figure 2). A little perivascular 
cuffing was seen in the region of the needle track in the sections of the pons. The amount of 
haemorrhage appeared to be more than was seen in the rodent study (MTX110-R0022T). 
There were occasional vacuoles containing myelin bodies adjacent to the areas of the needle 
track, a finding indicative of some previous neuronal loss. This was particularly evident in the 
section from the distal pons where there was a focal lesion but no clear needle track, probably an 
indication that this was the site of delivery of the test item. However, the changes were not 
markedly worse than in the other areas of the needle track, and are consistent with the pathology 
expected from the procedure. 
In the animal euthanized after 14 days, the needle track was still clearly visible in the sections 
that included the thalamus and the pons. At this time-point the haemorrhage had largely resolved, 
and the cellular response remained GFAP negative and IBA-1 positive. Many 
macrophages/microglia could be seen to be containing pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517], presumed to be hemosiderin. 
No new lesions developed in the period between the sacrifices, and the lesions that were 
associated with the route of administration were generally smaller and clearly resolving. 
Examination of the sections stained with Fluorojade indicated that there was no active necrosis 
or apoptosis in either of the treated animals. There were no microscopic findings recorded in the 
control animal. 
The route of administration therefore appeared to be well-tolerated, and the lesions caused by [CONTACT_174767]. The damage that was 
seen to have occurred was limited to the needle track and the area immediately adjacent to it. The 
NeuN staining indicated that the path of the needle was in the main passing through areas of low 
neuronal density, and as such the neuronal loss seen in the area of the track probably represents a 
very small loss of neurons in numerical terms, and an insignificant loss in biological terms. 
In conclusion, the intracranial administration of MTX110 was well-tolerated. There was no 
toxicity associated with the administration of the test item and the damage associated with the 
route of administration was limited and showed signs of repair in the time course evaluated. 
Safety of MTX110 formulation
All excipi[INVESTIGATOR_174706]110 are widely used pharmaceutical ingredients 
that have established safety profiles in the concentrations used. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin 
(HPBCD) is commonly used to improve the solubility of drugs for intravenous use, but has not 
previously been delivered directly to the brain by [CONTACT_174753]. However, HPBCD is administered at 
very high intravenous doses as a component of some marketed drug products, and compassionate 
use in children with Niemann Pi[INVESTIGATOR_174707] C has involved intrathecal delivery of high doses 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 30 Version 2.0(200mg) to the brain that appear to be well tolerated. Matsuo et al (2014) delivered doses up to 
200mg (10mg/kg) or 300mg (15mg/kg) to a single patient (20kg child weight assumed) twice 
weekly for 23 months[55]. This was reported to be well tolerated although the 300mg dose was 
stopped when an elevated CSF tau level was detected. Maarup et al (2015) delivered 200mg 
HPBCD intrathecally to a 12-year old child with NPC, with only subclinical hearing loss at high 
frequency noted.[56] In an on-going NIH clinical trial, doses of [ADDRESS_203966] been 
administered to 12 NPC patients intrathecally and are also reported to be well tolerated, except 
that Grade 1 ototoxicity has been observed in 2 patients. 
A dose of 200mg is more than 160 times higher than the dose of HPBCD that would be delivered 
in MTX110 panobinostat solution for infusion by [CONTACT_174753], assuming a convection volume of 12mL 
of 10μM panobinostat in 100μg HPBCD/mL solution. 
Flow rate assessment of CED in non-human primates
Two non-human primates (NHP) were treated with CED of gadolinium (Dr. K Bankiewicz, 
personal communication). Once the target was selected, infusion of 2mM MR-visible tracer 
(ProHance, Bracco) was performed by [CONTACT_174768] (16G) on the left and large (14G) 
cannula on the right side of the brain. After visualization of gadolinium infusion at the cannula 
tip, the infusion rate was ramped up from an initial 1 (16G cannula) or 4 μL/min (14G cannula) 
to a maximum of 33 μL/min. NHP1 received an infusion on the left thalamus with the 16G 
cannula and on the right thalamus and brainstem with the 14G cannula. NHP2 was infused 
bilaterally in the thalamus with the 14G cannula. The total infusion volume per hemisphere was 
245 and 1090 μL on left or right side respectively for one animal (NHP1, left thalamus: 246 μL; 
right thalamus: 438 μL; right brainstem: 655 μL) and 340 μL for the other (NHP2) in each 
thalamus. There was no observed toxicity that was related to the infusion with the respective 
volumes and infusion rates. 
CED experience in children with DIPG
There are several studies that support the feasibility of placing catheters safely into the brainstem 
and obtaining adequate coverage of a therapeutic agent using CED in humans. A feasibility study 
using co-infused imaging tracers with interleukin-13-Pseudomonas exotoxin in children with 
DIPG has shown that clinically relevant distributions of agents can be achieved in humans 
through the use of CED [57]. In a recent report of 2 children with DIPG and one patient with 
Parkinson’s disease, Chittiboina et al. showed that cannulas for CED can be accurately placed 
under direct MRI guidance using a similar navigation system proposed for this study [58]. The 
same group had previously shown that real-time image guided CED of therapeutic agents is 
feasible in children with brainstem lesions [16]. A case report by [CONTACT_174769]. demonstrates a 
clinical response to a brainstem located high grade glioma to CED of nimustine hydrochloride 
[59]. Another case report demonstrated safe and effective delivery of carboplatin using CED in a 
5 year old with DIPG [60]. The technical feasibility of CED in the brainstem is also supported by 
a report from Anderson et al. that used CED of topotecan for the treatment of 2 children with 
DIPG [61]. The first patient underwent CED 210 days after initial diagnosis and completion of 
radiation therapy at time of tumor progression. A total dose of 0.403 mg topotecan in 6.04 ml 
over 100 hours was administered. The second patient was treated 24 days after the initial 
diagnosis prior to radiation with a total dose of 0.284 mg in 5.30 ml over 100 hours.
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_203967] shown that coverage of the total tumor 
volume appears to be safe in children with DIPGs. At the recent meeting of the International 
Society Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO, 2016 Liverpool), [CONTACT_174835] (Bristol University, 
[LOCATION_006]) presented results following CED with carboplatin in children with DIPG. The range of 
infusion volumes and infusion rates (using four catheters) was 2.76 to 11.22 ml and 9-20 µl/min, 
respectively. Some subjects developed transient neurological symptoms such as weakness, ataxia 
and dysarthria, but overall, the treatment was well tolerated.
[CONTACT_174836] (Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [LOCATION_001] City; Surgical co-study 
chair on this proposal) is currently conducting a clinical trial using CED with a radiolabeled 
antibody for children with DIPG (NCT 01502917). The majority of the tumor volume can be 
covered with infusion volumes of 4000 L without significant adverse effects In this study, 
repeated CED was an option if the patient was without clinical or radiographic evidence of 
disease progression. There were no serious adverse events definitively related to surgery in 
children undergoing retreatment. The lower age limit is [ADDRESS_203968]. Souweidane is also utilizing repeated CED every 4 
weeks after the initial infusion with no safety concerns reported to date62.
Human experience of CED of MTX 110
The preclinical safety of MTX110 Panobinostat Solution for Infusion has been evaluated by 
[CONTACT_174770] a compassionate named patient supply basis. Patient treatments involved CED 
administration of MTX110 on one or two consecutive days at doses between 10 and 30 μM 
panobinostat; all patients treated to date are listed in the table below (Table 12). Further, UCSF 
conducted a single patient IND trial using MTX110 in a child with progressive DIPG. The CED 
procedure completed in the compassionate use protocol uses the same BrainLab navigation and 
catheter system and similar intra-operative MRI monitoring proposed in the current protocol. 
The patient underwent [ADDRESS_203969]-operative period. The patient went on to experience grade 1 dysphagia, 
grade 2 gait disturbance, and grade 1 abducens and oculomotor nerve disorder a few weeks after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Imaging done at time of new symptoms was concerning for tumor 
progression; however, contribution of local inflammation from CED therapy could not be ruled 
out and patient was started on increased dexamethasone for symptom management. In the second 
cycle, the patient received a total of 4.2mL of drug infusion. After this cycle, the patient 
experienced grade [ADDRESS_203970]-operative day 8. During both CED cycles, the patient received 
prophylactic dexamethasone to decrease local edema. Dexamethasone was tapered appropriately 
over hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174708]. During cycle 2, the patient also received a 24-hour course 
of mannitol in effort to decrease any component of edema that was contributing to increased 
dysphagia and weakness. The patient remains alive at the time of this protocol. Overall, these 
experiences provide supporting evidence of safety and starting dose for the current trial.

Summary of preclinical and clinical data
In summary, the relevant preclinical and clinical studies support the exploration of CED of 
MTX110 in children with DIPG: 
(1) The target of MTX110 is highly expressed in human DIPGs
(2) Human derived DIPG cell lines are sensitive to MTX110 
(3) CED leads to effective distribution within the brainstem
(4) CED of MTX110 under real time imaging is feasible 
(5) Published evidence supports the feasibility of CED in children with DIPG
(6) Five total pediatric patients with DIPG receiving MTX110 via CED support safety of 
delivery of MTX110 via the proposed CED protocol.

histones, leading to chromatin remodeling and increased cell cycle regulation, cellular 
differentiation and controlled apoptosis.
How the drug is supplied  
MTX110 is supplied as a white to off-white lyophilized powder in 10mL sealed amber-glass 
vials which, on reconstitution, provides a clear colorless solution. Each vial contains 14mg 
panobinostat base.
Storage and handling
MTX110 should be stored refrigerated (2-8°C). Refer to ‘Instructions for Use’ for reconstitution 
and dilution.
Side Effects
Human Toxicity: As outlined above, [ADDRESS_203972] delivery method proposed herein will in theory minimize these side effects 
significantly given the limited systemic exposure. This is supported by [CONTACT_174771]-directed brain tumor treatment ([CONTACT_174837], 
UCSF; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; personal communication). 
Neutropenia
Neutropenic complications should be managed promptly with antibiotic support. G-CSF may be 
used to manage neutropenia at the investigator’s discretion. 
Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia complications should be managed promptly with platelet transfusions as 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 34 Version 2.0clinically indicated and at the investigator’s discretion.
Pregnancy
The pregnancy category of MTX110 is D. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to 
avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with MTX110. If a pregnancy is reported, 
the pregnancy should be followed until the outcome becomes known.
2.[ADDRESS_203973] of care treatment other than 
radiotherapy. All children die from disease progression, with a median survival time of 9 
months. This trial will utilize repeated intratumoral CED of MTX110 in children with 
newly diagnosed DIPG, following initial treatment with radiotherapy. We will assess the 
safety of MTX110 (up to 12 mL total volume and up to 90 M concentration) delivered by 
[CONTACT_174753]. We will utilize an accelerated titration design (ATD) scheme. 
2.5.1 Dose Escalation Rationale
The dose escalation design in this study begins with escalation of dose 
administration on consecutive days followed by [CONTACT_174772]. The proposed dose volume escalation 
offers a larger volume of MTX110 to be delivered with each subsequent dose level 
of MTX110, up to 6 mL per treatment for 2 consecutive days of treatment per cycle 
(total volume 12 mL). This volume escalation provides for a larger volume of the 
tumor to be treated each time and ideally reaches the greatest treatment coverage of 
tumor. 
Once the RP2D volume is reached, the concentration of MTX110 will then be 
escalated. The starting concentration of MTX110 in this study is 30 M. This dose 
has been previously used in the compassionate use protocols outlined in Section 2.3 
and appears to be tolerable in human subjects. Based on the volume of distribution 
to volume of infusion (Vd:Vi) ratio (Study MTX110-S0023T), a drug concentration 
of 30 M is anticipated to result in a tissue drug concentration of 10 M throughout 
the treatment volume. This concentration is higher than the in vitro IC50 of < 
100nM, shown to have cytotoxic effects in patient-derived DIPG cell lines and also 
exceeds the dose of [ADDRESS_203974] been 
delivered via CED in rodent models and no animal has demonstrated excess 
toxicity, including no clinically relevant central nervous toxicity and no toxicity on 
histopathology tissue review (Study MTX110-R0021T; Study MTX110-R0226T). 
In higher concentrations up to [ADDRESS_203975]-
treatment tissue demonstrated mild gliosis on histopathology (Study MTX110-
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 35 Version 2.0R0227T; Study MTX110-R01197T). Given the tolerability of such high 
concentrations in murine models up to 300 µM, we propose to dose escalate to a 
maximum of concentration of 90 µM in the current study, with the goal to ensure 
therapeutic levels of MTX110 are reached throughout the CED treatment volume. 
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Characteristics
This is an open-label, PNOC multi institution, Phase I/II study of MTX110 delivered by [CONTACT_174773].
3.[ADDRESS_203976] 26 subjects will be enrolled.
Dose Administration
Initially, an accelerated titration design (ATD) will be employed. This design has the advantage of 
potentially reducing the number of subjects treated at sub-efficacious doses, and decreasing the 
accrual time for the trial. Each cohort will consist of one subject. The first subject will be started 
at dose level 1. A 14-day window of evaluation for toxicities is required for at least one subject at 
each dose level before determining the dose for the next cohort.

PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 40 Version 2.0Recommended synopsis of sequence of study events (site-specific set-up may vary with the 
approval of study chairs):
The procedure will take place in an operating room (OR) associated with an intraoperative MRI 
(iMRI) scanner, in order to facilitate confirmation of catheter placement and monitoring of 
infusate distribution. The configuration of the transfer system, and MR gantry allows rapid 
movement of an anesthetized and immobilized patient from the operating room to the MR bore, 
which is only separated by a door from each other. Specific surgical procedures can also be 
performed under sterile conditions within the actual MR room using MR-compatible equipment. 
The tumor target and trajectory will be selected and planned using the BrainLab navigation 
system based upon an imaging study obtained prior to the date of the procedure. The 
experimental agent will be delivered using the BrainLab Flexible Catheter system. This system is 
currently being used for CED in children with DIPG at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PI: 
[INVESTIGATOR_174686]), and for a single patient CED treatment with MTX110 performed at UCSF 
(PI: [INVESTIGATOR_174678]). 
1. A pre-surgical MRI (with DTI sequences) will be used in conjunction with the 
BrainLab iPlan software package for planning catheter placement, with a maximum of 2 
catheters placed into the tumor. With each treatment, a new planning MRI will be 
obtained and the trajectory and location of the catheter(s) optimized. The planning MRI 
will be obtained within [ADDRESS_203989]’s head, 
a maximum of 2 catheter(s) will be placed with the assistance of MRI-guided 
neuronavigation using standard neurosurgical techniques. Catheter position will be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_174776]. If the subject received a 
prior CED of MTX110, a new catheter location will be selected to avoid overlap of the 
infusate. Repeated T1-weighted sequences will be collected in real-time during the 
infusion to monitor infusate distribution. The maximum volume will be based on the 
subject’s dose level. 
3. We will monitor the initial infusate distribution with real-time MR imaging 
(approximately every 15 minutes with a duration for each sequence of about 5-8 
minutes), with the final component of the highest infusion volumes being done with the 
patient awake so that clinical assessments can be performed, as feasible. Each patient will 
be monitored with repeated imaging under general anesthesia until 1.2 to 1.6 cc are 
infused (equals to approximately 2 to 2.5 hours assuming an average infusion rate of 10 
microliters/minute). The patient will then be woken up from general anesthesia. The 
reminder of the volume (depending on the dose level) will be infused while the patient is 
awake. If needed, sedating medications will be used to avoid agitation. At the end of the 
infusion, the patient will be brought back to the MRI scanner for a final series of images. 
If there are any concerns in regards to clinical signs or vital signs, imaging might be 
obtained at anytime during the infusion if clinically indicated. The table below describes 
the approximate infusion times for each dose level assuming a maximum infusion rate of 
10 microliters per minute. The estimated total anesthesia time including catheter

4. We anticipate that changes to the infusion parameters and catheter placement may be 
required based on observations from the real-time MR images. We describe two possible 
scenarios below, but it is also possible that unforeseen distribution variations may occur:
a. If there is evidence of backflow of the infusate along the catheter, the infusion 
rate may be slowed. If backflow continues to be present on repeated imaging, the 
catheter(s) position will be adjusted. In general, this will involve advancement of 
the catheter 2-5 mm within the intra-operative MR scanner using sterile 
techniques. If after the adjustment there is evidence of ongoing backflow, this 
catheter will not be used for the infusion.
b. If distribution from a specific catheter placement is observed outside of the target 
volume (based on T2-weighted images) the catheter may be advanced or 
withdrawn along the same trajectory (same as in (a)); or the infusion stopped and 
the catheter repositioned along a different trajectory. If the catheter has to be 
repositioned along a different trajectory, the subject will be transferred to the OR. 
The catheter will be removed; a new trajectory will be selected by [CONTACT_174777] a new catheter will be placed. In this event, we anticipate that the same entry 
point and burr hole can be used, but it is also possible that a new entry point may 
be necessary (e.g. to avoid a vascular structure). Once the new catheter is inserted, 
placement will be confirmed with an MR scan. Once the position is confirmed, 
the infusion will be re-started. 
5. As described above, once a stable infusion rate is achieved, we will monitor under real 
time imaging for approximately 2-2.[ADDRESS_203990] every 15 minutes. This timing of 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 42 Version 2.0imaging will allow us to observe an infusion volume of a minimum of 1.2 – 1.6 mls with 
an expected distribution volume of approximately 2.4-3.5 mls using an average infusion 
rate of 10 microliters/min. This should be sufficient to assess adequate distribution and 
assess backflow. 
a. Once adequate distribution is confirmed and as clinically feasible, the subject will 
be transferred to the adjacent OR, removed from pin fixation, awakened, and 
extubated. The subject will then be monitored in an area close to the MR scanner, 
either in the adjacent OR or post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), or transferred to 
ICU for completion of infusion. Once the subject is awake enough to follow 
commands, we will perform neurologic assessments every hour appropriate to the 
patient’s level of consciousness and age, and continuous vital sign monitoring 
with blood pressure checked at least every [ADDRESS_203991]. 
Only subjects who recover to baseline or ≤  grade 1 toxicities will be considered 
for day 2 infusion (not applicable to dose level 1). If they meet criteria to start the 
2nd day of CED of MTX110, the subject will be transferred back to the intra-
operative MR scanner. The position of the catheter(s) will be confirmed and we 
will monitor under real time imaging for approximately 2-2.5 hours (same as for 
the Day 1 CED). Children who can tolerate imaging without anesthesia will not 
be sedated. Children who will not tolerate imaging without anesthesia, will be 
anesthetized. We will then follow the same sequence of events as outlined for 
Day1. 
6. Once the final CED is completed, catheters will be removed following the completion of 
the infusion; this will either occur in the OR or in the monitoring unit close to the OR. 
7. Continue to repeat cycles every 4-[ADDRESS_203992], each catheter infusion will be initiated at a rate of 1 microliter/min and 
increased by a maximum of 5 microliters/min every 15 minutes under real-time imaging. 
The infusion rate increase will be performed sequentially for each catheter. If there are 
any concerns regarding the infusate distribution, the infusion rate will be reduced. The 
infusion rate will increase to a maximum of 10 microliters/min for the initial CED 
procedure for each subject. If this infusion rate is tolerated (following the same criteria as 
for dose escalation in 10.2, if toxicity is thought to be related to rate of infusion), the 
maximum rate will increase to 15 microliters/min for the next CED procedure and only as 
clinically indicated. The subject’s vital signs will be continuously monitored during the 
infusion. The rate of the infusion will be under the discretion of the study team but will 
never exceed the maximum allowed rate. 
 
Assessment of safety and toxicity will include all safety evaluations over a 14-day period after 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817

Procedure
Note: site-specific procedures that differ from the procedures below must be 
submitted to the study chairs for review and approval. 
1) Surgical planning allowing up to 2 catheters into the tumor will be performed on a MRI 
scan acquired up to14 days prior to surgery. 
2) The iMRI suite consists of a neurosurgical operating room separated by [CONTACT_174779] a 3T GE large bore MRI scanner (model 750W). On the day of surgery the subject 
will be transported to the OR and placed under general anesthesia. 
a. All members of the team who are present in the MRI suite must have documented 
MRI safety training. Existing standard procedures for MR safety in the iMRI suite 
will be followed.
b. A member of the anesthesiology department must remain present for the entire 
procedure.
3) Using the pre-operative planning MR scan, and the BrainLab navigation system, 
BrainLab flexible catheter(s) will be inserted through burr hole(s) following pre-
determined trajectories and depths, and secured to the calvarium using supplied guide 
ports. Prior to insertion, the catheter will be primed with MTX110/gadoteridol mixture.
4) After catheter insertion, the patient will be transported to the iMRI scanner and an MRI 
scan will be obtained to confirm catheter position. 
5) Imaging will be performed intermittently during the initial infusion to monitor the 
distribution of the agents and for adjustments of catheter placement and infusion rate. The 
infusion volume for each catheter will be based on MR images of gadoteridol distribution 
acquired during the infusion procedure. 
6) Once a stable infusion rate has been established for both catheters, the remaining duration 
of infusion has been estimated, and as clinically feasible, the subject may be transferred 
to the PACU or ICU to complete the infusion. Repeat MR imaging will occur at 
completion of the CED infusion. Subjects that cannot tolerate MRI without 
sedation/anesthesia will need to be sedated or undergo repeat anesthesia for the end of 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 46 Version 2.0infusion scan.
7) After completion of infusion at each dose level, the catheter(s) will be removed 
depending on the dose level. For example, the catheter will removed on day 1 at dose 
level 1, day 2 at dose level 2, etc. 
8) It is recognized that experience is likely to result in minor refinements of this procedure. 
Such refinements will not require amendment of the protocol as long as they do not 
increase the risk for the subject.
9) Timing of follow-up infusions on day [ADDRESS_203998]’s return to 
pre-infusion baseline neurological exam or ≤  grade [ADDRESS_203999]’s neurological exam 
has not returned to pre-infusion baseline by 48 hours from completion of day 1 infusion, 
the CED procedure on day 2 will be canceled and catheters removed. 
5.3 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0).
The Dose Limiting Toxicity Period will be the first 14 days from the start of the CED procedure. 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as:
Any intolerable (as deemed by [CONTACT_89818]) grade 2 or any grade 3 or 
higher neurological toxicity felt to be attributable to the CED infusion procedure or to the 
MTX110 injection with gadoteridol within a period of 14 days after the infusion.
Any systemic treatment related grade 3 or higher hematologic or non-hematologic 
toxicity (after maximal medical management of nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) within a 
period of [ADDRESS_204000] severe toxicity experienced. 
Dose modifications are described in Section 5.5. 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
All concurrent medical conditions and complications of the underlying malignancy will be 
treated at the discretion of the treating physician according to acceptable local standards of 
medical care. Subjects should receive analgesics, anti-emetics, antibiotics, anti-pyretics, and 
blood products as necessary. Although warfarin-type anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86042], 
careful monitoring of coagulation parameters is imperative, in order to avoid complications of 
any possible drug interactions. All concomitant medications, including transfusions of blood 
products, will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. 
Guidelines for treating certain medical conditions are discussed below; however, institutional 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204001] may be placed on 
dexamethasone, and/or the dose increased up to 0.3 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 16 mg/day or 
per institutional standard. Length of therapy will depend on clinical symptoms. 
Antiemetic Medications
Dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 blocker (e.g., ondansetron or granisetron) may be administered to 
all subjects as premedications unless contraindicated for the individual subject. Anti-emetics will 
also be prescribed as clinically indicated during the study period.
Colony Stimulating Factors
Though unlikely to be needed, the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is 
permitted to treat subjects with neutropenia or neutropenic fever but not to allow for eligibility.
 
Dietary Restrictions
None.
Prohibited Medications
No drug interaction studies have been conducted specifically with MTX110. The drugs shown 
below are noted in the Prescribing Information for other panobinostat marketed products as 
interacting with panobinostat when administered orally. The relevance of these interactions to 
MTX110 delivered by [CONTACT_174780]. 
Because there is a potential for interaction of MTX110 injection with other concomitantly 
administered drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, strong inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP3A, CYP2D6 as well as anti-arrhythmic medicines (including amiodarone, disopyramide, 
procainamide,  quinidine and sotalol) and drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval  
(including chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin,  bepridil and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]) are to be avoided the week prior to and the week following every CED infusion.The 
case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-the-counter 
medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Appendix B presents guidelines for identifying 
medications/substances that could potentially interact with the study agent. Treatment with 
these agents and any other that interact with MTX110, should be avoided whenever possible 
and must be avoided the week prior to and following every CED infusion.
Additionally, the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174711]:
Other anti-neoplastic therapy, including cytotoxics, targeted agents, endocrine therapy or 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 48 Version 2.0other antibodies. 
Radiotherapy other than what was used as part of primary treatment.
Any prior or concurrent investigational therapy is not permitted.
5.[ADDRESS_204002] modification will be allowed where: dose escalation (following dose levels in table 
5.2.1) is permitted if a subject experiences a toxicity of grade 0 or 1; dose de-escalation will be 
followed if the toxicity is dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or worse (i.e., an intolerable grade 2 or 
grade 3 and above, as defined in Section 5.3); while the dose will remain unchanged if a subject 
experiences a moderate toxicity (i.e., moderate grade 2). At the second occurrence of any grade [ADDRESS_204003] 3+[ADDRESS_204004] 
3+3 dose escalation design, there are three possible scenarios for this cohort of 3 subjects, if 
there are (is):
two or three DLTs, the RP2D will be defined as the next lower dose level;
zero DLTs (i.e., the transition from the ATD to the 3+3 design was triggered by [CONTACT_174781] a grade 2 toxicity as opposed to a DLT and no DLTs were observed 
in the additional 2 subjects), then dose escalation will occur based on Table 5.2.1; 
one DLT, an additional [ADDRESS_204005] scenario with six subjects at the current dose there are two subsequent scenarios: 
only one DLT and then dose escalation can occur based on Table 5.2.1. 
more than one DLT and then the next lower dose level is the RP2D. 
6. TREATMENT PLAN
Subjects with a radiographic diagnosis of DIPG are potentially eligible for this protocol. 
Eligibility requirements and treatment begin after the completion of standard of care 
radiotherapy. Each subject will sign a consent form and complete eligibility procedures prior to 
enrollment, and baseline procedures prior to any study procedure. Treatment consists of 
intratumoral treatment of MTX110 by [CONTACT_174753]. The intent is to treat every 4-8 weeks with CED 
infusions for up to 24 months or until tumor progression or intolerable toxicity. If subjects 
continue to derive clinical benefit, discussion with investigators and study sponsor will 
determine feasibility and clinical appropriateness to continue therapy. Treatment consists of 
placement of up to 2 CED catheters into the tumor. The placement of catheters at the time of 
surgery is planned based on an MRI obtained prior to the procedure, using a predictive 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204006] MR guidance, using co-infused 
gadoteridol, to assess leakage and tumor volume coverage. Toxicity is assessed during and after 
each CED infusion, with the protocol defined dose limiting toxicity period being 14 days after 
each CED procedure. Subjects may be treated at the time of progression after discussion with the 
Study Chair(s) and Neurosurgical Chair(s), if the progression occurs outside of the previously 
treated area, and if the treating physician feels the subject is experiencing clinical benefit. 
Baseline and on-study laboratory studies, and every 4-8 week MRIs are done to assess toxicity 
and tumor status, as described in the study calendar, for up to 24 months or until progression or 
intolerable toxicity. After completing all study treatment, final assessments will be performed, 
including a 30-day toxicity check. All subjects are followed for toxicity, progression-free 
survival and overall survival.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) within this protocol is  defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the study procedure (placement of catheters) or use of 
the drug,  whether or not considered to be procedure or drug related. (Please follow directions for 
routine reporting provided in the Data Reporting section). Additionally, all serious adverse 
events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of subject safety 
and care. The Expedited Reporting sections in this protocol provide guidelines for expedited 
reporting.
7.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.[ADDRESS_204013] access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.
Surgical adverse events that cannot be graded by [CONTACT_174787] (e.g., prolonged 
intubation) will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_174788] (DSMC) per their established reviewing schedule. Please 
see Appendix E PNOC Data Safety and Monitoring Plan for more information. All other 
events that can be graded by [CONTACT_174789]. This 
includes wound infections, hemorrhage, cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) leak, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_174716].
Attribution of the AE:
- Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment including surgical 
procedure.
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment including surgical 
procedure.
- Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment including surgical 
procedure.
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment including surgical 
procedure.
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment including surgical 
procedure.
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 56 Version [IP_ADDRESS] Suspected 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug or study procedure caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND 
safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug/study procedure and the adverse event. A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
7.1.2 Unexpected 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are considered 
unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the investigator 
brochure. For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial would be 
anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally not be 
listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
Some adverse events are listed in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with the same class of 
drugs, or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, even though they have 
not been observed with the drug under investigation. Such events would be considered 
unexpected until they have been observed with the drug under investigation. For example, 
although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some subjects exposed to drugs in the ACE 
inhibitor class and angioedema would be described in the investigator brochure as a class effect, 
the first case of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be considered 
unexpected for reporting purposes.
7.1.3 Serious
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ≥ 24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174717] ≥ 24 hours
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life function
Congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer
Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of the study
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204014] caused death. 
7.2 Adverse Event Monitoring
PNOC uses the web-based OnCore® Clinical Trials Management System for monitoring and 
recording of Adverse Events (AEs) including all adverse reactions considered “serious” (also 
called Serious Adverse Events, or SAEs).
All Adverse Events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_174790]. The PNOC Operations Office will discuss the toxicity, grade, and relationship 
to study intervention for all AEs in question.
In addition, all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reviewed and monitored by [CONTACT_174791], and will be discussed at the UCSF DSMC meeting, which take 
place every six (6) weeks. Please see Appendix E PNOC Data Safety and Monitoring Plan for 
more information. 
7.2.1 Surgical Adverse Event Grading
Anticipated Adverse Effects
Complications related to the surgical procedure will be documented. ‘Minor’ are those defined as 
leading to little or no effect on function, and not resulting in a significant increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210]. ‘Major’ complications are those resulting in permanent sequelae with functional limitations, 
or those leading to a significant increase in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Surgical adverse events that cannot be 
graded by [CONTACT_174787] (e.g., prolonged intubation) will be reviewed on a weekly basis 
by [CONTACT_174792] (DSMC) per their 
established reviewing schedule. All other events that can be graded by [CONTACT_174793]. This includes wound infections, hemorrhage, cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] 
(CSF) leak, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_174718].
7.3 Adverse Event Reporting
All Adverse Events (AEs) will be entered into OnCore®. Appendix D includes detailed 
information about PNOC reporting timelines.
The study period during which AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed consent is 
obtained and ends [ADDRESS_204015] administration of study treatment. After this period, 
only SAEs that are attributable to study treatment should be reported. Subjects removed from 
therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until adverse event(s) resolves or 
returns to baseline status.
The PNOC Investigator will assign attribution of the possible association of the event with use of 
the study therapy, and this information will be entered into OnCore®. The Investigator must also 
comply with all reporting requirements to their institutional Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) and Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 58 Version 2.07.4 Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting 
All Adverse Events which meet the definition of ‘Serious’ as well as other medically significant 
events described below require expedited reporting to PNOC. Below are instructions for 
recording and reporting of these events. Please contact [CONTACT_174794]. See 7.1.3 for the definition of an SAE.
All SAEs (see above definition) on any PNOC trial, regardless of relationship, must be 
reported to PNOC via OnCore and Email within one business day of first PI [INVESTIGATOR_38417], even 
if the SAE is ongoing. The SAE must be followed until resolution:
OnCore: All SAEs must be entered into the Subject Console in OnCore 
(https://oncore.ucsf.edu/ > Subject Console > SAE Tab on left). The OnCore SAE 
record should be updated immediately as new information becomes available until the 
SAE is resolved. (Toxicity segment MUST be completed. Don’t forget to click “Add” 
button.) Please refer to the “PNOC OnCore SAE Entry Guide: Field by [CONTACT_113373]” for more 
information.
Email: Please also email with, at minimum, the following 
information: 
In the subject line: “SAE: Subject PNOC ID” (e.g. “SAE: PNOCxxx-1”)
In the body of the email: Subject PNOC ID and the OnCore assigned SAE number
Site IRB: Each PNOC site is also responsible for following their own IRB guidelines 
for reporting SAEs.
SAE Data Entry in AE CRF:
All SAEs must also be entered into the AE CRF for that Cycle (Subject Console > Forms by 
[CONTACT_174795]/Forms by [CONTACT_4838]). This entry must take place within [ADDRESS_204016] day of the Cycle in 
which the SAE occurred, or as soon as possible in the case of an SAE that was discovered late. 
Please reference the “PNOC OnCore SAE Reporting and Entry” in SharePoint for more 
information. 
SAE Deviations:
If the protocol procedures around SAEs are not followed (e.g. reporting timelines or dose 
modifications), a Deviation may also need to be entered in OnCore (Subject Console > Deviation 
Tab on left). Please reference the “PNOC Deviation Reporting Guidelines” in SharePoint for more 
information.

administration of the study drug(s), and is determined to be related either to the 
investigational drug or to any research related procedure, the Study Chair and the PNOC 
Operations Office must be notified by [CONTACT_174796] [ADDRESS_204019] (IRB)
The PNOC Operations Office must report events meeting the UCSF IRB definition of 
“Unanticipated Problem” (UP) within 10 business days  of awareness of the event. 
Each participating site will follow their institutional reporting guidelines to the IRB.
7.4.4  PNOC Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the PNOC Operations Office is responsible 
for determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for 
expedited reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The PNOC Operations Office must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse 
reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The Sponsor-Investigator (PNOC) needs to 
ensure that the event meets all three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction 
Unexpected
Serious 
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted 
as an expedited IND safety report.
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar 
days after the PNOC Operations Office determines that the suspected adverse reaction 
qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to 
FDA no later than 7 calendar days after PNOC initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety 
report will be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 60 Version 2.0soon as the information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)). 
7.4.5  PNOC Reporting to Midatech Pharma (supplier of MTX110 injection)
The Sponsor-Investigator (PNOC) is responsible for reporting of serious adverse events 
to Midatech Pharma. SAEs should be reported to the Chief Medical Officer at Midatech 
Pharma  within one business day 
using the same criteria described in Section 7.4.3 PNOC Reporting to the UCSF Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee. Additionally, copi[INVESTIGATOR_174719]. 
Periodic safety reports with tabulation of all AEs and SAEs should be provided to 
Midatech every 3 months during the study. 
7.5 Secondary Malignancy
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML]) 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.

9. EVALUATION CRITERIA
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, subjects with measurable disease will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_174798]. 
9.[ADDRESS_204022] their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Subjects who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response. Subjects who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non-target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
9.1.2 Disease Parameters
Measurable disease 
Measurable disease is defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in two 
dimensions (longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of no less than double 
the slice thickness.
All tumor measurements will be recorded in millimeters or decimal fractions of 
centimeters. Previously irradiated lesions are considered non-measurable except in cases 
of documented progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 62 Version 2.0All measurements will be taken using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations will be 
performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 30 
days before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique will be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 
Non-measurable disease
Non-measurable disease is all other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(< double the slice thickness). 
Target and Non-target lesion
Tumor dimensions are determined by [CONTACT_174799]. For most CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is 
present and therefore is considered a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for 
tumor progression/response. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 3 can be 
selected as “target” lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non-
target lesions (including CSF positive for tumor cells). The lower size limit of the target 
lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease 
the partial volume effect.
Tumor Measurements
Regarding MRI imaging, the sequence that best highlights the tumor (T1 enhanced or T2 
weighted or FLAIR images) will be chosen to determine response criteria. The same 
sequence should be used for serial measurements. Response determination will be based 
on a comparison of an area [W (longest diameter of the target lesion) x T (transverse 
measurement, perpendicular to W)] between the baseline assessment and the study date 
designated in the follow-up Report Form. Reports for the follow-up exams should 
reiterate the measurements obtained at baseline for each target lesion. Nontarget lesions 
or newly occurring lesions should also be enumerated in these reports, and changes in 
non-target lesions should be described.
1. For MRI imaging, the longest diameter can be measured from the axial plane or the 
plane in which the tumor is best seen or measured. The longest measurement of the tumor 
is referred to as the width (W). 
2. The perpendicular measurements should be determined - transverse (T) measurement, 
perpendicular to the width in the selected plane.
3. The cystic or necrotic components of a tumor are not considered in tumor 
measurements. Therefore only the solid component of cystic/necrotic tumors should be 
measured. If cysts/necrosis composes the majority of the lesion, the lesion may not be 
“measurable”.
Options:
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 63 Version 2.0If the cyst/necrosis is eccentric, the W and T of the solid portion should be measured, 
the cyst/necrosis will be excluded from measurement
If the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a small portion of the tumor (< 25%), 
disregard and measure the whole lesion
If the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a large portion of the tumor, identify a 
solid aspect of the mass that can be reproducibly measured
Leptomeningeal tumor spread is usually not a target lesion, and usually cannot be 
measured accurately. Presence and location of leptomeningeal tumor spread should 
be noted and change in extent/thickness assessed on follow up studies.
Overall Response Assessment:
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both the target and non-
target lesion, and the appearance of new lesions, where applicable, according to the 
criteria described in the table below. The best overall response is the best response 
recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started). The subject's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Response Criteria for Target/Non-Target Lesions:
Response criteria are assessed in 2 dimensions – the product of W x T.
To assess response/progression, the ratio is calculated: W x T (current scan) divided by 
W x T (reference scan). Development of new disease or progression in any established 
lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g. 
when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the progressive disease takes precedence.
For purposes of this study, response criteria for target lesions are:
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all known disease for at least [ADDRESS_204023] disappeared on a stable 
or decreasing dose of corticosteroids.
Partial response (PR): A reduction of at least 50% in the size of all measurable tumors 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204024] observation. In addition, there can be no 
appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion.
Stable Disease (SD): A decrease of <50% or an increase of <25% in the sum of the 
products of the largest diameters of measurable lesions and no evidence of new lesions 
for at least 4 weeks on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids.
Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 25% increase in the sum of the products of the largest 
diameters of the measurable lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
9.1.3 Duration of Response
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the CED infusion 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_204025].
9.1.5 Overall survival
OS is defined as the duration of time from diagnosis to time of death. 
9.2 Imaging Analyses
At the end of the study, all images will be evaluated by [CONTACT_9559]. Please see Appendix H 
for details. All imaging from initial diagnosis and/or prior to radiotherapy, as well as available 
imaging collected on study and/or in follow up must be submitted for central review and study 
analyses. Examples of imaging analyses may include, but are not limited to, descriptive 
correlation of imaging characteristics and clinical outcomes, and imaging correlates with 
treatment response or resistance.
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 65 Version 2.010.1 Study Design/Endpoints
This is an open-label, prospective, multi institutional safety and early efficacy protocol. All 
subjects will be treated at a PNOC Institution or participating institution for this study. The 
primary endpoint is safety; the secondary endpoint is a preliminary estimate of efficacy.
Primary Endpoint:
Safety and toxicity measurements of repeated CED administration of MTX110 following 
standard of care focal radiotherapy using CTCAE version 4.0 in newly diagnosed 
subjects with DIPG.
Secondary Endpoint:
OS at 12 months (OS12) in newly diagnosed subjects with DIPG.
Exploratory Endpoints:
Assessment of observed distribution of gadoteridol compared to pre-treatment modeling 
of the drug distribution utilizing predictive imaging software.
The Quality of Life exploratory endpoint associated with this study will be descriptive 
and will be limited to frequency tables and summary statistics.
To perform central review of imaging to explore MR qualitative and quantitative 
measures as markers of disease response and/or progression and treatment effect in 
comparison to institutional evaluation of disease response and/or progression.
10.2 Dose Escalation
Initially an accelerated titration design (ATD; diagram 1) will be employed. This design has the 
advantage of potentially reducing the number of subjects treated at sub-efficacious doses, and 
decreasing the accrual time for the trial. Each cohort will consist of one subject. The first subject 
will be started at dose level 1. A 14-day window of evaluation for toxicities is required for at 
least one subject at each dose level before determining the dose for the next cohort. 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 66 Version 2.0Diagram 1. Accelerated trial design.
Intra-patient dose modification (Diagram 2) will be allowed as follows: dose escalation 
(following the dose levels in Table 5.2.1) is permitted if a subject experiences a toxicity of grade 
0 or 1; dose de-escalation will be followed if the toxicity is dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or worse 
(i.e., an intolerable grade 2 or grade 3 and above, as defined in Section 5.3); while the dose will 
remain unchanged if a subject experiences a moderate toxicity (i.e., moderate grade 2). At the 
second occurrence of any grade [ADDRESS_204026] 3+[ADDRESS_204027] 3+3 dose escalation design, there are three possible scenarios for 
this cohort of 3 subjects, if there are (is):
two or three DLTs, the RP2D will be defined as the next lower dose level;
zero DLTs (i.e., the transition from the ATD to the 3+3 design was triggered by [CONTACT_174781] a grade 2 toxicity as opposed to a DLT and no DLTs were observed 
in the additional 2 subjects), the dose escalation will occur based on Table 5.2.1; 
one DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be entered at the same dose level. 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204028] scenario with six subjects at the current dose there are two subsequent scenarios: 
only one DLT and then dose escalation can occur based on Table 5.2.1. 
more than one DLT and then the next lower dose level is the RP2D. 
Diagram 2. Intra-patient dose escalation.
10.3 Sample Size and Accrual
The number of subjects enrolled in the safety study will depend upon the DLTs observed and the 
number of dose levels tested as the study progresses in accordance with an ATD followed by a 
3+3 design. The ATD is expected to enroll 1 to 7 subjects with a minimum of 5 subjects in the 
3+[ADDRESS_204029] been assessed, a detailed review of the safety and efficacy data will be performed and 
discussed with the FDA and the DSMC to discuss either further dose escalation or enrollment 
into the efficacy study. 
Secondary Objective: The most recent Children’s Oncology Group study that treated children 
newly diagnosed with DIPG with a combination of radiation therapy and temozolomide resulted 
in an OS12 rate of 40% (SD ± 6.5%). A sample size of 19 patients achieves 80% power to detect 
a difference of 30% using a one sided exact binominal test. The target significance level is 5% 
and the actual significance level is 3.5% with this test. If 12 or more patients are alive at 12 
months, the null hypothesis that OS12 is 40% will be rejected.

higher and definitely related to the procedure based on evidence on MRI such as 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, worsening edema or necrosis.

10.4 Stratification Factors
There are no stratification factors.
10.5 Analysis of Endpoints
Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population will include all subjects who are 
enrolled in the study. The ITT population will be the primary population for evaluating efficacy 
and subject characteristics.
As-Treated Population (AT): The AT population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 
dose of study drug. The AT population will be the primary population for evaluating safety.
Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Safety of repeated CED of MTX110 following standard of care focal radiotherapy will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_174801], scheduled laboratory assessments, vital sign 
measurements, and physical examinations for subjects who receive the drug. The severity 
of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events and 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according 
to CTCAE) will be summarized by [CONTACT_174802](s). 
Grade 1 and 2 adverse events will be summarized if related to study therapy. Descriptive 
statistics will be utilized to display the data on toxicity.
Analysis of Secondary Endpoint
We will assess the preliminary efficacy using overall survival at 12 months (OS12) in 19 
evaluable DIPG patients treated within the expansion cohort which will include subjects 
treated as part of the dose escalation portion of the trial on the recommended phase 2 
dose (RP2D). Analyses will be performed after all enrolled subjects have completed [ADDRESS_204031]. The primary analysis will be based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier 
estimates and the associated 95% CIs will be calculated for OS12. As described above, if 
12 or more of the 19 patients are alive at 12 months, the null hypothesis that OS12 is 40% 
will be rejected.
Analysis of Exploratory endpoint
The exploratory aims associated with this study will be descriptive and will be limited to 
frequency tables and summary statistics. 
11. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 69 Version 2.011.1 Data Reporting
11.1.1 Method
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his/her designee will prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study. Study 
specific Case Report Forms (CRFs) will document safety and treatment outcomes for 
safety monitoring and data analysis. All study data will be entered into OnCore® via 
standardized CRFs in accordance with the CTMS study calendar, using single data entry 
with a secure access account. The Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will complete 
the CRFs as soon as possible upon completion of the study visit; the Investigator will 
review and approve the completed CRFs. 
The information collected on CRFs shall be identical to that appearing in original source 
documents. Source documents will be found in the subject’s medical records maintained 
at each PNOC site. For participating sites, source documents will be maintained per 
institutional guidelines. All source documentation should be kept in separate research 
folders for each subject.
In accordance with federal regulations, the Investigator is responsible for the accuracy 
and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered onto CRFs. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_174721]. 
All source documentation and CTMS data will be available for review/monitoring by [CONTACT_174803].
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_174722]. At study completion, when the CRFs have been declared to be complete and 
accurate, the database will be locked. Any changes to the data entered into the CRFs after 
that time can only be made by [CONTACT_14230], the Trial 
Statistician, and the PNOC Project Leader.
11.1.2 Responsibility for Data Submission
Please refer to Appendix C for data submission timelines.
11.2 PNOC Oversight and Monitoring Plan
Given the complexity and technical requirements of this study, PNOC has determined that this 
should initially be a limited institutional trial (n=2). All subjects will be treated at the University 
of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco (UCSF) or the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where 
study Surgical Chair [CONTACT_174836] has experience in CED technique. Additional PNOC 
institutions will be allowed to open the study if the surgical PI [INVESTIGATOR_174723] a CED procedure at either UCSF or Memorial Sloan Kettering to learn the particularities 
of the study. The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the main monitoring entity for this study. The UCSF 
DSMC will work together with UCSF to monitor the study in accordance with the UCSF NCI 
approved Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP). The DSMC will routinely review all 
adverse events and suspected adverse reactions considered “serious.” The UCSF DSMC will 
audit study-related activities to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204032] operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP). Significant results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the 
appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as 
applicable. Please see Appendix E PNOC Data Safety and Monitoring Plan for more 
information.
11.[ADDRESS_204033] of the clinical trial. The PNOC Operations 
Office will coordinate, at minimum, quarterly conference calls with the PNOC member 
institutions to discuss risk assessment. The following items will be discussed, as appropriate:
Enrollment information 
Cohort updates (i.e. DLTs)
Adverse events (i.e. new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events 
and new safety information)
Protocol violations
Other issues affecting the conduct of the study
11.[ADDRESS_204034] all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual administered the investigational drug or employed as a control in the investigation. 
Case histories include the case report forms and supporting data including, for example, signed 
and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the 
physician, the individual's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s), and the nurses' notes. The case history for each 
individual shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.
Study documentation includes all CRFs, data correction forms or queries, source documents, 
Sponsor-Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., 
protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed subject consent forms).
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.
In accordance with FDA regulations, the investigator shall retain records for a period of 2 years 
following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it 
is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for 
such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued.
11.5 Coordinating Center Documentation of Distribution 
It is the responsibility of the PNOC Operations Office to maintain adequate files documenting 
the distribution of study documents as well as their receipt (when possible). The HDFCCC 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817

segment of distribution (e.g., FDA, drug manufacturer, participating sites, etc.).
Correspondence file: should contain copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (paper or electronic) of all protocol versions, cover 
letters, amendment outlines (summary of changes), etc., along with distribution documentation 
and (when available) documentation of receipt.
Correspondence log: should be a brief list of all documents distributed including the date sent, 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841](s), and (if available) a tracking number and date received.
At a minimum, the PNOC Operations Office must keep documentation of when and to whom the 
protocol, its updates and safety information are distributed.

PNOC member institution must comply with the policies and standards put forward by [CONTACT_174813]/DSMB. For member institutions that do not follow an NCI-approved DSMP, 
the UCSF DSMC will be considered the “institutional DSMC” mentioned in this document. Such 
institutions will be electronically monitored.  
The institutional DSMC/DSMB activities for this study will include: 
Review of subject data
Review of suspected adverse reactions considered “serious” (SAEs) 
Monitoring every month/ (depending on patient accrual)
Minimum of a yearly regulatory audit
Monitoring and reporting guidelines
All institutional Phase 0 or Phase 1 therapeutic studies are designated with a high risk 
assessment. The data is monitored monthly by [CONTACT_174814]/DSMB as subjects are 
enrolled and includes all visits monitored up through the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) period. 
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) DSMC is responsible 
for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all HDFCCC institutional clinical studies. In the 
case of all PNOC protocols, the UCSF DSMC will work together with non-UCSF PNOC member 
institution DSMC/DSMBs in order to ensure DSMP compliance. Each non-UCSF DSMC/DSMB 
will be responsible for providing regular monitoring reports to PNOC and the UCSF DSMC. 
These reports will be used by [CONTACT_174815], patient safety, and 
protocol compliance as well as to make decisions about dose escalations, where applicable. 
PNOC and the UCSF DSMC reserve the right to conduct on-site monitoring at any non-UCSF 
member institution if DSMP requirements are not being met. If the need to perform a monitoring 
visit at a non-UCSF member institution arises, source documents will be provided by [CONTACT_174816], 
patient safety, and to verify data entry. 
The PNOC Operations Office provides administration, data management, and organizational 
support for the PNOC member institutions in the conduct of any PNOC clinical trial. The PNOC 
Operations Office will summarize and communicate adverse events, safety data, and other 
study matters to the PNOC member institutions on a quarterly basis.
The Study Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of any PNOC trial and for monitoring its 
safety and progress at all participating sites (as outlined in the PNOC Study Chair and Co-Chair 
Responsibilities SOP). The Study Chair will conduct continuous review of data and subject 
safety and discuss each subject’s treatment with the PNOC Operations Office. The discussions 
are documented in the PNOC Operations Office meeting minutes.
Multicenter communication
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 82 Version 2.0The PNOC Operations Office will coordinate, at minimum, quarterly conference calls with the 
PNOC member institutions to discuss risk assessment. The following items will be discussed, as 
appropriate:
Enrollment information
Cohort updates (e.g. DLTs and dose escalations)
Adverse Events (e.g. new AEs, unresolved AEs, and new safety information)
Protocol violations
Other study conduct issues
Dose level considerations
Dose level assignments for any subject scheduled to begin treatment must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_174817] e-mail.
If an unexpected Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) occurs in a subject treated at any participating 
PNOC member institution, all member institutions must be notified of the DLT by [CONTACT_174818] 1 business day . Member institutions will otherwise be provided with 
final DLT reports as they become available.
Adverse event review and monitoring
PNOC uses the web-based OnCore® Clinical Trials Management System for all patient 
registrations and data entry. The OnCore® System will also track patient level protocol 
compliance and safety information. 
All Adverse Events (AEs) will be entered into OnCore®. 
All Adverse Events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_174790]. The PNOC Operations Office will discuss the toxicity, grade, and relationship 
to study intervention for all AEs in question. 
All Adverse Events must be entered into OnCore® within 10 business days  of becoming aware 
of the event. Member institutions will submit this information to PNOC via the Adverse Event 
Form within OnCore®.  
In addition, all adverse reactions considered “serious” (also called Serious Adverse Events, or 
SAEs), regardless of relationship, must be entered in OnCore® and reported to the PNOC 
Operations Office within [ADDRESS_204042] every six (6) weeks. 
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study, or within [ADDRESS_204043] 
administration of the study drug(s), and is determined to be related either to the investigational 
drug or to any research related procedure, the Study Chair and the PNOC Operations Office 
must be notified by [CONTACT_174796] [ADDRESS_204044] may be by [CONTACT_14223] e-mail.
Increase in adverse event rates
If an increase in the frequency of Grade 3, 4, or 5 Adverse Events (above the rate reported in 
the Investigator Brochure or package insert), the Study Chair or the PNOC Operations Office is 
responsible for notifying the UCSF DSMC at the time the increased rate is identified.

Information on Possible Interactions with Other Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers 
and Non-Study Healthcare Team
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental agent [agent name]. This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_174819]-
Oncology Consortium and [Sponsor-Pharmaceutical Company]. This form is addressed to the 
patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient. 
[Agent name] interacts with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813]. Because of this, it is 
very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study. It 
is also very important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start taking a 
new medicine while you take part in this study. When you talk about your medicine with your 
study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the-counter 
remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort. 
Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions. You must also tell your other prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet. These 
are the things that you and they need to know: 
[Use or delete sections below as appropriate.]
[Agent name] interacts with (a) certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver. 
The enzyme(s) in question is/are [name(s) of CYP isoenzyme(s)], and [insert brief, easy 
explanation of the nature of the interaction, i.e., for inducers: “[agent name] is broken 
down by [CONTACT_159961].”] 
[Agent name] must be used very carefully with other medicines that need these liver 
enzymes to be effective or to be cleared from your system. 
Other medicines may also affect the activity of the enzyme. 
o[The following text is for agents that are metabolized/cleared by [CONTACT_98804].] 
Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers”) could reduce the 
effectiveness of the drug, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s activity 
(“inhibitors”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the chance 
of harmful side effects.
o[The following text is for when the agent requires the enzyme in order to be 
converted from prodrug to active drug.] Substances that increase the enzyme’s 
activity (“inducers”) could result in high levels of the active drug, increasing the 
chance of harmful side effects, while substances that decrease the enzyme’s 
activity (“inhibitors”) could reduce the effectiveness of the drug.
o[The following text is for when the study agent modulates the enzyme activity.] 
[Agent name] is considered a(n) “[inducer/inhibitor]”of the enzyme, meaning that 
it can affect the levels of other drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_174820]. This 
can lead to harmful side effects and/or reduce the effectiveness of those 
medications. 
You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category. 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/2019 85 Version 2.0Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to 
switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of 
[name(s) of CYP isoenzyme(s)].”
Your prescribers should look at this web site 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx or consult a medical reference to see 
if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid. 
Please be very careful! Over-the-counter drugs have a brand name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s 
usually big and catches your eye. They also have a generic name—it’s usually small and 
located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list. Find the 
generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an 
adverse interaction. 
[The following are examples of text for common over-the-counter medications or 
supplements that may interact with the study agent.] Be careful: 
oIf you take acetaminophen regularly: You should not take more than 4 grams a 
day if you are an adult or 2.4 grams a day if you are older than 65 years of age. 
Read labels carefully! Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines for 
pain, flu, and cold.
oIf you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit: Avoid these until the study is over. 
oIf you take herbal medicine regularly: You should not take St. John’s wort while 
you are taking [agent name].
o[Add other specific medications here, if necessary.]
Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs. 
You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to 
use an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement. 
Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your 
study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you. Your study

Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204047] at each PNOC site should 
interpret the anatomic images for clinical purposes and then send them to UCSF for quantitative 
analysis.
All images generated for each patient should be anonymized and sent to UCSF, either 
electronically or by [CONTACT_174824]. Sites should batch ship all images pertaining to each patient at 
the time the patient comes off treatment. 
Guidelines for Imaging Protocols
Serial exams should be performed on the same 3T MR system using the commercial 8-channel 
or other multi-channel head coil. The sequences may either be performed in a pure axial 
orientation or aligned with the AC-PC line, as is the default at many institutions. Our guidelines 
follow the Consensus recommendations for a standardized Brain Tumor Imaging Protocol in 
clinical trials (Ellingson BM. Neuro-Oncology. 2015).
Recommended outline of MR imaging protocol:
1. 3-plane localizer
2. T1-weighted pre-gadolinium volumetic images: this high-resolution (3-dimensional 1 mm 
isotropic) acquisition is used as a reference for comparing with the post-gadolinium 
images and to identify signs of hemorrhage. We recommend 3-dimensional isotropic T1-
weighted images using a gradient-recalled echo (GRE) acquisition with inversion 
preparation (IR)
3. T2-weighted images: used in conjunction with the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion 
recovery (FLAIR) images to define the spatial extent of the T2 lesion. 
4. FLAIR images: required for defining treatment response using the RANO criteria or 
iRANO criteria as indicated per each study protocol.
5. Diffusion weighted images: the entire brain should be covered with at least 6 different 
gradient directions at b=1000 and with one acquisition having b=0. The slice thickness 
and spatial resolution should be chosen to allow calculation of maps of apparent 
diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy. 
6. Echo planar gradient echo dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) images: A series of 
images should be acquired during the injection of a bolus of 0.1mmol/kg of gadolinium 
contrast agent that is delivered at a rate of 3-5m/s using a power injector and with a 15-
20ml flush of normal saline delivered at the same rate. The dose and timing of 
gadolinium should be kept consistent to facilitate clinical interpretation. Slice thickness 
(3-5mm) and location should be chosen to cover as much of the T2 lesion as possible. 
PNOC 015 CC# 170817
Version date 06/20/[ADDRESS_204048]-gadolinium T1-weighted volumetric images: this high-resolution (3-dimensional 1 
mm isotropic) acquisition is used to define the spatial extent of the enhancing volume 
and for registration between examinations. We recommend 3-dimensional isotropic T1-
weighted images using a gradient-recalled echo (GRE) acquisition with inversion 
preparation (IR).
8. Post-gadolinium T1-weighted images: these should match the pre-gadolinium images 
are used to define the extent of the enhancing lesion. For consistency in contrast 
enhancement we recommend that these images be acquired after volumetric post-
gadolinium T1-weighted images.
Any of the above sequences or a combination thereof may be used for quantitative analysis of 
disease response and/or treatment effect. Decisions regarding which sequences will be utilized 
will be determined as based on the specific study intervention and anticipated imaging findings 
that accompany the intervention (e.g. immunotherapy vs. targeted small molecules), as well as 
individual characteristics of tumor subtypes. In addition to assessing disease response and 
treatment effect, sequences may be used for pre-surgery exams, clinical evaluation of the 
patient, and volumetric analysis of regions of interest. 
De-Identification and Labeling
It is the responsibility of the PNOC sites to de-identify images according to HIPAA, Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) guidelines, GCPs and local regulatory requirements, with the following 
considerations:
Do not remove the date of the exam or the technical information (eg, slice location, kVP, 
echo time, etc).
Do not modify time or date information before or during the de-identification process.
Labeling of Digital Images
Use the patient ID, the date (ddmmyy) and scan number (01 or 02 for the two advanced imaging 
exams) to label the data as follows: PatientID_date_xx
Checklist for Media Submission
Completed Exam Data Sheet. 
De-identified DICOM images. 
Sending Digital Images via FedEx:
PNOC sites should batch ship all images pertaining to each patient at the time the 
patient comes off treatment. 
All MRIs should be de-identified prior to shipment.
All shippi[INVESTIGATOR_174733].
All shipments require signature [CONTACT_174831].

the T2 lesion (T2L), as well as T2/FLAIR changes. The T1 weighted pre-contrast image will be 
used to define a brain mask so that intensity values can be normalized. The diffusion images 
are processed to generate maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional 
anisotropy (FA). The perfusion data are processed to calculate maps of relative cerebral blood 
volume (rCBV), peak height (PH) and percentage recovery (RECOV).

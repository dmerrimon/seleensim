2 BACKGROUND (REPORT OF PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS)  
2.[ADDRESS_376743] medical health problems in the developed world and it is likely to worsen(1 –3).  Chronic pain 
persists well after the initial injury or illness that produced the initial pain has healed. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has defined ch ronic pain as pain that lasts more than three to 
six months beyond the normal time  of healing(4). Chronic pain invariably is generated by [CONTACT_106625], 
psychological, and environmental factors (bio-psycho-so cial concept of chronic pain). It is difficult to 
manage, and many afflicted patients have a florid medical history with multiple comorbidities. Chronic 
pain is also difficult to generally define beyond its chronicity. Chronic pain is routinely characterized by 
[CONTACT_307886]: the nature of the pa in as perceived and reported (e.g. nociceptive, 
neuropathic, ischemic), the pathophy siology causing the pain (e.g., painful diabetic neuropathy), or the 
anatomical location that the pain is perceived (e.g., chronic low back pain), or a combination of these (e.g., discogenic low back pain). The published Classification of Chronic Pain, Descriptions of Chronic 
Pain Syndromes and Definitions of Pain Terms from IASP lists around 100 separately identifiable chronic 
pain conditions(4).   
2.[ADDRESS_376744] line treatment strategies are generally conser vative treatments including: exercise programs, 
physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy, cogn itive behavioral therapy (CBT), biofeedback, 
acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimul ation (TENS), and oral medications. Second line 
treatments become more intensive and involve the use of more extreme CBT, more powerful 
medications such as systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and interventional techniques such as nerve blocks (local 
anesthetic or steroids) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_307844]. The last  line of treatment involves  more advanced therapi[INVESTIGATOR_307845]. Systems such as intrathecal drug delivery (IDD) or spi[INVESTIGATOR_307846] (SCS) may be implanted. Surgery to repair  an anatomical issue responsible for the pain may 
be performed. Finally, surgical techniques that block pathways to the brain such as cordotomy, 
rhizotomy, and thalamotomy may be used rarely in extreme cases.  Recent guidelines and the literature on the treatm ent for chronic pain of the trunk and/or limbs 
demonstrate that each of the surgical interventions ha ve the potential to be effective in managing pain, 
increasing patient activity, and to result in high  patient satisfaction when conservative treatment 
modalities have failed. The risk profile for SCS ther apy has advantages compared to surgical revision 
and neuroablation due to the fact it is reversible as the device can be surgically removed.  Furthermore, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_307847] a trial period with SCS, in  which leads are temporarily placed in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_307848], to  assess tolerability and the degree of pain relief 
prior to being permanently implanted.  The Neuromod ulation Foundation recommends that an SCS trial 
precede major reconstructive procedures and ablative  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (5). In addition, SCS therapy has the 

ECAP Clinical Study Protocol                  
 
Saluda Medical Americas, Inc. -CONFIDENTIAL-  
CLIN-PCL-006732 advantage of not having drug side effects, includin g respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], as compared to IDD systems, 
or addictive properties, as compared  to opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444], which is curren tly of epi[INVESTIGATOR_307849] (US).  There is consensus among national medical societies to recommend SCS as a 
treatment option in patients with chronic, severe pain for which conservative treatment modalities have 
failed or are contraindicated(5– 13).  SCS may be delivered in parallel with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_307850]. 
2.3 Rationale for the Proposed Treatment  
SCS is a well-established therapy with a long history of use in treating chronic intractable pain of the 
trunk and/or limbs.  SCS consists of  applying an electrical stimulus to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_307851] (e.g., A β-fibers) to generate action potentials.  A β-fibers are the low-threshold sensory 
fibers in the dorsal column that contribute to inhibition  of pain signals in the dorsal horn (14).  The action 
potentials summed together form the electrically ev oked compound action potential (ECAP). Therefore, 
ECAPs are a direct measure of spi[INVESTIGATOR_307852].  
 
The original SCS device consisted of an implante d radiofrequency-controlled power source connected 
to two electrodes (Shealy et al. 19 67).  Over the last [ADDRESS_376745] been many advances in SCS 
therapy, including a better understanding of the targ et patient population and improvements in device 
technology and reliability. The technology has ev olved from large profile, single channel, non-
rechargeable implantable pulse generators (IPG) and monopolar leads, to smaller profile, multichannel, 
rechargeable IPGs with new programming parameters and multiple contact [CONTACT_307887]. 
 
A significant challenge that still remains in SCS, however, is the ever-changing distance between the 
stimulating electrodes relative to their spi[INVESTIGATOR_307853]. The electrode is fixed in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814], while the spi[INVESTIGATOR_307854], including the 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_50126] (e.g., breathing, heartbeat), coughing, or changes in body position (e.g., standing, sitting, lying). Small changes in distance between the electrode and spi[INVESTIGATOR_307855], as the curr ent density with SCS varies with the inverse of the 
distance between the electrode and spi[INVESTIGATOR_307856] (15). Thus, at a fixed SCS output level, the 
degree of spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (SC) activation varies widely.   Currently available SCS systems, regardless of the stimulation para meters, are open-loop systems and 
incapable of measuring SC activation or varying stimulation output based upon such measurement. For these systems, the stimulation is fixed based on in-clinic programmed settings. There is a feed-forward system (16) with an accelerometer located in the puls e generator, distant from the electrode to spi[INVESTIGATOR_307857], that utilizes pre-programmed, fixed output stimulation programs based on gross postural 
changes (17). In all cases, however, the stimulation output does not vary based upon how much current is reaching the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], which can result in significant variation in SC activation. To manage variance in stimulation, patients generally reduce the stimulation amplitude using a remote control, which improves tolerability of stimulation and reduces the incidence of overstimulation, but also reduces the 
amount of analgesia that can be achieved (18).  
 
To address these limitations, the Evoke System has been developed that is able to record in vivo human 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_307858] (19,20). An ECAP is measured for each 
stimulation pulse delivered; this reflects the degree of SC activation elicited by [CONTACT_307888]. The system may operate in fixed-output, open-loop (plus ECAP measur ement) or ECAP-controlled, closed-loop mode. In 
open-loop SCS, the system measures ECAPs, which may be used to determine optimal stimulation 
settings, but are not used to automatically adjust stimulation current to maintain a target response. In closed-loop SCS, the difference between the meas ured ECAP and the target ECAP amplitude is 
minimized by [CONTACT_307889]’ therapeutic window. By [CONTACT_5203] -time modulation of the output current, the closed-loop system

the target level (Figure 1).  The system is designed to operate in either ECAP-controlled, closed-loop 
stimulation mode, or open-loop (fixed-output) stim ulation mode equivalent to other commercially 
available SCS systems.  ECAPs may be measured and recorded in either stimulation mode.

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
7.1 Study Pain Assessment 
The Study Pain Assessment includes the following:  
 
x A body map drawing for subjec ts to shade in the areas of the subject’s pain that are intended to 
be treated with SCS (i.e., “study  pain ”).  The Investigator will review the pain map with the subject 
and identify which are the pain locations intend ed to be treated with SCS and which are not. 
 
x A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to rate study pa in intensity for each region shaded as having 
study pain on the body map. The VAS consists of a 10 cm line with two end-points representing 
“no pain” and “worst pain imaginab le”. Subjects are asked to rate their pain by [CONTACT_1299] a mark 

ECAP Clinical Study Protocol                  
 
Saluda Medical Americas, Inc. -CONFIDENTIAL-  
CLIN-PCL-006732 on the line corresponding to their level of pain. The distance along the line from the “no pain” 
end to the subject’s mark is measured.   
 
x Questions regarding the quality and nature of the subjects’ study pain and sleep. 
 
x At Baseline only: 
 
o Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (DN4), which is a screening tool for neuropathic 
pain with 10 items split across four questions regarding the subjects’ study indication 
pain.  Seven items related to pain quality (i.e. sensory and pain descriptors) are based 
on an interview with the patient and 3 items are based on the clinical examination.   
 
o Questions regarding the study pain etiology and pathophysiology. 
7.2 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and Patient Satisfaction 
Patient Global Impression of Chan ge (PGIC) is a single item meas ure of global improvement with 
treatment.  The subject is presented wi th a 7-point rating scale containing the options “ve ry much 
improved”, “much improved”, “minimally improved”, “no change”, “minimally worse”, “much worse”, and 
“very much worse”.   
 
Subject recommendation of and satisfaction with the stimulation therapy and study pain relief will also 
be collected.  Recommendation options include “strongly re commend,” “recommend,” “neutral,” “not 
recommend,” and “definitely not recommend.”  Satisfac tion options include “very satisfied,” “satisfied,” 
“neither satisfied nor unsatisfied,” “u nsatisfied,” and “very unsatisfied.”   
7.3 PROMIS-29+2 
The PROMIS-29+[ADDRESS_376752] of the PROMIS-29 profil e (v2.1) and two PROMIS Cognitive Function 
Abilities items. The PROMIS-29 is a 29-item profile in strument that assesses 8 universal domains (not 
disease-specific): Physical Function, Anxiety, Dep ression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to 
Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Pain Interference, and Pain Intensity. The first seven 
domains are assessed with 4 questions each; Pain Intensity is measured with a single 11-point 
numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). High scores represent more 
of the domain being measured. Thus, on symptom- oriented (negatively-worded) domains of PROMIS-
29 (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interferenc e, and sleep disturbance) , higher scores represent 
worse symptomatology. On the function-oriented (pos itively-worded) domains (physical functioning and 
social role) higher scores represent better functioning. The addition of the two items from the PROMIS 
Cognitive Function Abilities, for a total of 31 qu estions, allows for incorporation of the PROMIS 
Preference Scoring System (PROPr), which is a generic societal, preference-based summary score 
(also called a health utility score). The PROPr is meas ured on scale where 0 is the utility of being dead 
and 1 the utility of “full health.” The lowest possible score is –0.022 (for a state viewed as worse than dead), and the highest possible score is 1.   
7.4 PROMIS-10 Global 
The PROMIS Global Health measure produces two sco res: Physical Health and Mental Health. PROMIS 
Global includes 10 items: four items that reflect diff erent aspects of physical health (e.g., fatigue, physical 
function, pain) contribute to a Global Physical Health  score, and four items that reflect different aspects 
of mental health (e.g., mood, cognition, social activi ties/role) contribute to a Global Mental Health score. 
A change in Global Physical Health may be the result of a change in fatigue, physical function, or other 
domain of physical health. The scores present a summar y of multiple aspects of health. Higher PROMIS 
T-score represents more of the concept being meas ured. Thus, a person who has T- scores of [ADDRESS_376753] deviation better (more healthy) 
than the general population.

CLIN-PCL-006732 7.5 Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition – Adult Short (POMS 2-A Short) 
The Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition – Adult Short (POMS 2-A Short) is a 35 item, 5-point Likert scale 
that measures mood states overall (Total Mood Dist urbance) as well as for six mood clusters: Tension-
Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-
Bewilderment. A scale score is also calculated for Friendliness, which is considered separately as a 
mood state that may influence the severity of the mo od disturbance through interpersonal functioning.  
Higher scores indicate more negative mood states ex cept for Vigor-Activity where higher scores indicate 
increased Vigor. 
7.6 Stimulation Characteristics 
Subjects will be asked questions about stimulatio n sensation and to shade in the areas where they 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_307859] a body map drawing.   
7.7 Posture Change Measurements 
Data on stimulation intensity and ECAP amplitude at vari ous stimulation levels (i.e., activation plot) and 
in different postures will be collected in both stimulat ion modes.  Subjects will rate the stimulation intensity 
on an 11-point numeric rating scale ( 0 equals “no feeling” and 10 equals “very intense” ).  All data will be 
recorded on device logs, except subject ratings, which will be recorded on the CRF.  
7.8 Neurophysiological Measurements  
Neurophysiological measurements of the stimulated fibers (e.g., ECAP features, conduction velocity, 
chronaxie, rheobase, late responses) will be collected.   Data is automatically recorded on the device 
logs.  7.9 Programming Parameters and Characteristics 
Program parameters (e.g., frequen cy, pulse width, stimulation amplitude) and characteristics (e.g., 
usage) will be collected.  Data is au tomatically recorded on the device logs. 
7.[ADDRESS_376754] to participate 
in.  Potential assessments include (but are not limited to):  
x Medication interaction: Additional neurophysiological data may be collected during changes in 
medication to measure the effect of medications on spi[INVESTIGATOR_307860]. Subjects may be 
requested to return to original doses of medicati ons temporarily during this time.  For example, 
if a subject is tapering medications, they may be asked to record their dail y intake and return to 
the clinic for additional visits to collect neur ophysiological measurements and optimize their 
stimulation therapy during the taper. 
x Programming algorithms and dose:  Various programming parameter algorithms and/or various 
levels of therapy or spi[INVESTIGATOR_307860] “dose” may be evaluated.   
x Usability: As new or modified products beco mes available during the study, questions that 
pertain to the technical capability/performance (u sability) of the product(s) may be asked of 
subjects.  
x Pain signs/symptoms with stimulation on and/or off (e.g., Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory 
(NPSI), Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)-specific questions, bedside-Quantitative 
Sensory Testing (bedside-QST)) 
 These assessments may occur anytime during the study.  These optional assessments are in addition to 
the required protocol data collection and there are no foreseeable additional risks to the subject.  If 
additional testing is deemed to have additional risks, the investigator will obtain a separate consent.

9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Event Definitions 9.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occu rrence, unintended disease or injury, 
or untoward clinical signs in subj ects, whether or not related to th e investigational medical device. 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is defined as an AE that  
x Led to death, 
x Led to serious deterioration in the health of  the subject, and that either resulted in: 
1. a life-threatening illness or injury, or 
2. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 3. prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
4. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function, 
x Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condit ion or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760] (e.g., 
the index implant procedure, or device replacement due to normal battery depletion or lead migration), or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307861], is not considered an SAE. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_376757] (UADE)  means any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life-threatening problem or de ath caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, seve rity, or degree of incidence in the investigational 
plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 An event will not be considered a UADE if it is  a known consequence of the underlying disease or 
condition under investigation, surgery, or other ev ents that commonly occur in the study population 
independent of the investigational device.  
The final determination of whether an AE meets th e definition of a UADE will be made by [CONTACT_307891]. 
9.[ADDRESS_376758] supply the Sponsor with any additional 
information related to safety repo rting of a particular event.   

ECAP Clinical Study Protocol                  
 
Saluda Medical Americas, Inc. -CONFIDENTIAL-  
CLIN-PCL-006732 9.2.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators are required to report all AEs from th e time of consent (except as outlined below). If an 
AE leads to multiple outcomes that sequentially  worsen, only the worst AE will be reported. 
 
Investigators shall report AEs to th e Sponsor, and to their reviewing IRB per the IRB’s reporting 
requirements. Investigators are required to report  UADEs to the Sponsor and their reviewing IRB as 
soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_376759], per 21 CFR 812.150 (refer to section 13 .7.2 for Investigator reporting requirements). 
 
AE reporting exceptions: 
x AEs that would be reasonably expected to be associated with any surgical procedure (e.g., 
anesthesia associated symptoms, surgical site pa in, post-procedure pain) will not be required 
to be reported as AEs unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the nature and/or severity is 
outside of what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_307862]. 
 
x Lack of efficacy, by [CONTACT_5071], does not constitute an AE since failure to receive therapeutic benefit 
is an issue of efficacy, not safety.   
x Loss of therapy/stimulation does  not constitute an AE unless an untoward medical occurrence 
results.   
 
x A s ubject’s perception of the stimulation induced feeling of stimulation sensation is called 
paresthesia. There are well-known challenges associated with optimizing SCS such as 
changes in stimulation intensity and stimulation in unwanted areas.  These will not be reported as AEs unless the Investigator determines the nature and/or severity is outside what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_307863].    
x Temporary changes in symptoms and stimulation that are alleviated with programming will not 
be reported as AEs unless the Investigator determines the nature and/or severity is outside what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_307864].  
9.3 Independent Medical Reviewer and/or Adjudication Committee 
Independent medical reviewer and/or adjudication  committee will be responsible for the review, 
evaluation, categorization, and adjudication of all AE s that occur during the clinical study. AEs will be 
reported based on this adjudication.   [ADDRESS_376760] to its identity, quality, durability, 
reliability, safety or performance. Device de ficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and 
inadequate labelling. 
10.2 Device Deficiency Reporting 
The Investigator shall report all suspected device deficiencies to the Sponsor. Device deficiencies will 
not necessarily result in an AE. However, if an AE is associated with a device deficiency, the AE shall 
be documented and reported.

11.1 Sample Size 
A sample size of 300 will provid e a precision (defined as the half-width of the two-sided 95% exact 
binomial confidence interval) of approximately ±6% or smaller for any event based on an incidence of 
50%; an observed lower or higher incidence will pr oduce a more precise (i.e. narrower) interval (25). 
11.[ADDRESS_376761] will be collected and assessed across study visits to 
characterize neurophysiological measures an d clinical outcomes with the Evoke System. 
11.3 General Statistical Procedures  
The following general statistical methods will be employed to assess the study data: 
 
x There are no pre-planned formal statistical hypothesis tests. 
 
x Standard summary statistics will be used to summarize key study variables. Categorical 
variables will be summarized via incidence and percent. Continuous variables will be 
summarized via mean, median, standard deviation, and range.   
x Findings of significance may be presented and include p-values and/or 95% confidence 
intervals as appropriate.  
x Standard tests for significance will be employ ed, including one sample t-tests.  Additional 
exploratory analyses may be performed and includ e correlation analysis, linear and logistic 
regression analyses, repeated measures analyse s, and generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
analyses as appropriate. 
 
x Unless stated otherwise, statistical significance is defined as achieving a p-value less than 0.05.  
P-values will be nominal and not adjusted for multiplicity.  
 
x In the event planned parametric methods are fo und to be inappropriate based upon observed 
distributions of individual vari ables, appropriate non-parametric methods will be employed. 
 
x The incidence of all distinct AEs will be presente d. AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_12917], 
severity, and relatedness to the procedure, devi ce, and/or stimulation. AEs will be reported 
based on the adjudication committee determination.

by [CONTACT_1201]. The Investigator or his/her authorized de signee shall inform the subject of this information.  
After approval by [CONTACT_1201], a copy of this ICF must  be provided to the participating subjects, and the 
informed consent process as described above repe ated, in accordance with the IRB requirements. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_376767] data will be collected and entered in an electronic data capture (EDC) system specifically 
created for this study in accordance with this study protocol, regulatory requirements (21 CFR Part 11), 
and GCP. Data from other external sources (e.g., de vice logs) may also be entered into the EDC 
system. Data may be reviewed by [CONTACT_307893] g programmed or manual queries to ensure 
accuracy of the data entered and minimize the occurrence of missing data. Data management activities will be specified in the Data Management Plan. 
13.3.2 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored to ensure the rights an d well-being of human subjects are protected; the 
reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; and the conduct of 
the study is in compliance with the study protoc ol, regulatory requirements, GCP, Declaration of 
Helsinki, and any conditions of ap proval imposed by [CONTACT_32484]. Monitors will be 
qualified by [CONTACT_307894].  
Monitoring activities will be conducted in accordance with the Monitoring Plan. 
13.3.3 Audits/Inspections  
Audits of the investigation sites may be performe d by [CONTACT_16015], independent of and 
separate from routine monitoring or quality control functions, to evaluate study conduct and compliance 
with the study protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, GCP, Declaration of Helsinki, and any 
conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_32484]. 
 
The FDA or other regulatory agenci es may perform inspections of the investigation sites before, during,

CLIN-PCL-[ADDRESS_376768] Training All implanting Investigators will be trained on the device. All primary site pe rsonnel (Investigator(s) and 
core site staff) will be trained on the study prot ocol and the applicable Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFRs).   Support staff may be trained minimally based on delegated tasks.   
13.5.[ADDRESS_376769] been 
plagued by [CONTACT_307896]’ perception of pain and inconsistent reporting of these 
measurements.  For example, a subject may give subs tantially differing pain scores at different follow-
up time points but describe their pain as not having changed.  For this reason, subject and 
Investigator/investigation site staff training on pr operly completing pain assessments will be performed 
to provide reliable and useful data.  The training is two-fold, 1) train on the scale being used, and 2) 
train on the pain that is intended to be treated with SCS (to set expectations appropriately).  As 
described by [CONTACT_307897] (26), this protocol requires Investigators (preferably the 
implanting Investigators) to perform a thorough training  with the potential subject as part of the baseline 
assessment to set and manage appropriate expect ations and increase subject understanding of the 
study indication pain (i.e., pain intended to be trea ted with SCS), as well as, differentiate comorbid pain 
conditions (non-index/non-study indication pain) to increase the likelihood of conscientious subject reporting of pain that is intended to be treated in th e study.  To obtain accura te reporting at follow-up, 
re-training will utilize the baseline pain map to remind the subject of the pain identified at baseline in 
which the Investigator intended to treat.  Re-train ing of subjects on the pr oper completion of pain 
assessments to provide reliable and useful data may be conducted at any time during the study as the 
Investigator and site staff deem necessary. 
13.6 Investigator Responsibilities 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted according to the signed Clinical Trial 
Agreement (CTA)/Investigator Agreement (IA), st udy protocol, regulatory requirements, GCP, 
Declaration of Helsinki, and any conditions of ap proval imposed by [CONTACT_32484]; for

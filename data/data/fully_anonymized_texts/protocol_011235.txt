1.1 Primary Objective  
 
Aim 1: Determine whether randomization to a [ADDRESS_1198509] cancer 1 to 
5 years previously.   Hypothesis: Women randomized to donepezil for [ADDRESS_1198510] better memory 
performance than women receiving placebo.  
 
1.2 Secondary Obje ctives  
 
Aim 2: Determine whether a 24-week course of treatment with donepezil  compared to placebo improves 
executive functions (working memory, verbal fluency, set shifting), processing speed and global cognitive 
performance in women who have received chem otherapy for breast cancer 1 to 5 years previously . 
Hypothesis: Women randomized to donepezil for [ADDRESS_1198511] better executive function, 
processing speed and global cognitive performance than women receiving placebo.  
 
Aim 3: Determine if a 24-week c ourse of treatment with donepezil  reduces self -reported cognitive 
problems in women who have received chemotherapy for breast cancer 1 to 5 years previously compared 
to placebo.  Hypothesis: Women randomized to donepezil for 24 weeks will report fewer cogni tive 
problems than women receiving placebo.  
 
Aim 4: To determine the effect of a 24-week course of treatment with donepezil  on toxicities and adverse 
events .  Hypothesis: No group difference . 
 
1.3 Tertiary (Exploratory) Objectives  
 
Aim 5: Determine whether APOE genotype (1 or 2, ε4 alleles v none) is associated with poorer pre -
randomization cognitive performance and more cognitive complaints in women who have received 
chemotherapy for breast cancer 1 to 5 years previously and to dete rmine if APOE predicts who will 
respond to treatment.  Hypothesis: Women who are carriers of the APOE ε4 alleles will have poorer pre-
randomization cognitive performance , more cognitive complaints , and respond better to donepezil  than 
women without the ε4 a lleles.  
 
Aim 6: Determine whether low cognitive reserve (CR) is associated with poorer pre -randomization 
cognitive performance and more cognitive complaints in women who have received chemotherapy for 
breast cancer 1 to 5 years previously and determine if cognitive reserve predicts who will respond to 
treatment. Hypothesis: Women with lower CR will have poorer pre -randomization cognitive 
performance, more cognitive complaints, and respond better to donepezil than women high in CR.  
  
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study  Disease  
   
Cancer -related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) frequently occurs in breast cancer survivors following 
cytotoxic adjuvant or neo -adjuvant chemotherapy  and will be the focus of this study .   
 
2.2 Study Agent  
 
Donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept®) is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetyl cholinesterase.  It is 
currently FDA approved for use in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.  
WF-[ZIP_CODE]  
Amendment 4, Protocol Version Date 06/07 /[ADDRESS_1198512] for participants participating in this study. Drug/placebo will be 
packaged and distributed by [CONTACT_859932]., Irving, [LOCATION_007] .  
 
IND Status : We have conducted several controlled trials involving cancer patients using the proposed 
dosages of donepezil and consistently fo und a very low risk profile.  In a feasibility study for this 
proposal with [ADDRESS_1198513] cancer survivors enrolled between 7/24/2012 and 1/24/2013 and randomly 
assigned to receive the same dosages as proposed in this study (5mg x 6 weeks increased to  10mg x 18 
weeks) or placebo, we had excellent compliance (98% in the donepezil group), few withdrawals from the 
study due to toxicities (4 in the donepezil group), and only four adverse events (3 in the Control arm and 
1 in the Donepezil arm).  All were un related to the study treatment (Lawrence et al., 2015) . In other 
published studies we reported a similar profile of few toxicities with this agent.  In a phase [ADDRESS_1198514] with 
198 brain tumor survivors ≥[ADDRESS_1198515] brain irradiation treatment who were randomized to the same 
dosage of donepezil (5mg x 6 week s increased to 10mg x 18 weeks) or placebo, only 14 donepezil 
participants discontinued treatment due to toxicity compared to 5 control participants (p = .030) and 19 
SAEs were reported (10 for the donepezil arm and 9 for the control arm); only two of the donepezil 
events and one control were coded as possibly or probably related to the study drug.  Toxicities were 
queried at 6, [ADDRESS_1198516] common complaint, experienced to some degree by 
58% of the donepezil participants and 67% of  the control participants (p = .241).  Anorexia occurred in 
21% and 15% of the donepezil and control group, respectively (p = .301), nausea in 14% and 21% (p = 
.171), and diarrhea in 25% and 9% (p = .005) (Rapp, Case, Peiffer, Naughton, & Shaw, 2013) .  A very 
similar toxicity profile was reported in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_859906]  (Shaw et al., 2006) .  Thus the risk profiles associated with the 
proposed dosages of donepezil when used with cancer patients including brea st cancer survivors 
following chemotherapy is minimal and supports not requiring an IND.   The study will be submitted to 
the FDA for IND exemption  request  as described  in the DCP memo dated January 14, 2013 . 
 
The recommended dosage for patients with dement ia is donepezil 5mg/day for 6 weeks escalated to 
donepezil  10mg/day if well -tolerated.  Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either one tablet of 
donepezil 5mg or  one tablet of  matching placebo orally once a day for 6 weeks followed by [CONTACT_859933] 5mg tablets  (10mg total) or two tablets of matching placebo orally once a day for [ADDRESS_1198517] 
dose of oral donepezil (5mg for 6 weeks followed by 10mg daily for 18 weeks) to placebo in breast 
cancer survivors who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy 1 -5 years prior to enrollment and who 
reported cognitive dysfunction (WF NCORP Research Base study #97 211).  The study was open at 16 
sites within the WF NCORP Research Base. We enrolled 62 women between 7/24/11 and 1/24/12 for an 
excellent accrual rate of 10.2 subjects per month.  Of the women who completed study (76% of those 
enrolled), self -reported compliance to study drug was 98% and completion of all assessments was 98%.  
Participant toxicities were minimal (mostly Grade 1 and 2; p>.05).   
 
In addition, the identical dosage and regimen was used successfully in a phase 2 study  (WF NCORP 
Research Base study # [ZIP_CODE] ) (N=3 5 of brain tumor patients who had completed a course of ≥[ADDRESS_1198518] 6 months prior to enrollment as well as in a subsequent phase 3 study  (WF

tolerance of donepezil was quite good and sel f-reported adherence was >90%.

can range f rom mild to severe, often is chronic and affects social and occupational functioning and life 
quality 3-6.  
 
The specific phenotype and course of CRCD remain unclear . 70% of longitudinal studies of non -CNS 
cancer patients treated with chemotherapy show some cognitive deficits with point estimates ranging 
from 17% to 70% 7. CRCD is often reported by [CONTACT_859934]  5, 8-12.  For 
example, among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy 21% exhibited CRCD before 
chemotherapy, 65% exhibited cognitive changes during or shortly after treatment, and 61% showed 
decline approximat ely 1 year after treatment ended with approximately 2/[ADDRESS_1198520] cancer survivors who were assessed between 1 to 5 
years following a course of chemotherapy showed significantly poorer learning and memory performance 
compared with women who were treated with local therapy (surgery and radiation)10.  Late CRCD effects 
including poorer memory, processing speed and executive  functioning in breast cancer survivors have 
been observed up to 21 years following treatment14.  In our recently completed phase II feasibility study 
(#[ZIP_CODE]) conducted through the Wake Forest CCOP  Research Base, we documented deficits in learning 
and memory, verbal fluency, processing speed,  executive function and motor speed and dexterity in [ADDRESS_1198521] (neurotoxicity) and indirect pathways (treatment induced 
metabolic and hormonal abnormalities, inflammatory cytokine activation, medical comorbidities, fatigue 
and injury to other body o rgans)18. Structural and functional CNS changes occur in as many as 70% of 
patients19.  These changes can include periventricular white matter lesions, necrosis, ventriculomegaly 
and cortical atrophy20.  Alterations in metabolism and cerebr al blood flow have been observed21 along 
with atrophy22.   
 
Damage to the hippocampus may be particularly important in CRCD . The hippocampus, a brain 
region critical to learning, memory and mood, is rich in cholinergic neurons and hi ghly susceptible to 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy23. Rodents exposed to methotrexate, which crosse s the blood brain 
barrier, exhibit impairment in spatial memory function which is correlated with decreased hippocampal 
cell proliferation24.  Smaller gray and white matter volumes in prefrontal, hippocampal and 
parahippocampal regions in humans have been docume nted [ADDRESS_1198522] 
received chemotherapy.

Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are the standard of care for individuals with Alzheimer ’s 
dementia,25, 26 and vascular dementia27 and are frequently used for milder forms of impairment such as 
Mild Cognitive Impairment syndro me28. Furthermore, there is evidence of AChEIs efficacy in treating 
cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease29, multiple sclerosis30, and traumatic brain 
injury31, 32.  AChEIs have also improved cognitive functioning in young, healthy adults33.  In addition to 
the known direct effects on neuronal function, donepezil, the most commonly prescribed AChEI, also 
increases cerebral perfusion in critical brain areas related to cognitive processing34. Advantages of 
donepezil are its availability in generic form, its high tolerance profile and a simple dosing regimen.   
 
Preliminary studies  
 
Our research group has tested donepezil in several cancer survivor populations.   
 
Brain tumor patients following brain irradiation. Shaw et al. reported significant improvement in 
cognitive function, cognitive complaints, mood and quality of life among br ain tumor patients treated 
with 5mg/10mg daily dose of donepezil at least [ADDRESS_1198523] battery assessing major domains of cognition (attention, 
language, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], working memory, visuomotor speed and dexterity, processing speed, 
executive function) and standardized questionnaires were used. That unco ntrolled phase 2 study was 
followed by [CONTACT_859935] 3 study (5R01NR009675, Rapp PI)  of brain tumor patients 
who were ≥[ADDRESS_1198524] cancer survivors 1 -5 years following chemotherapy who reported moderate to severe cognitive 
symptoms using the same comprehensive cognitive battery, we found participants randomized to 24 
weeks of donepezil (5mg x 6 wk. + 10m g x 18 wk.) had better memory (HVLT -R Total recall, p = 0.03; 
HVLT -R Discrimination, p = 0.04) scores after 24 weeks than participants assigned to placebo15.  
Sensitivity analyses revealed that partici pants with lower baseline memory scores  (≤7 on Trial 1 of 
HVLT -R) who were randomized to donepezil showed greater improvement relative to controls than 
participants with better memory function assigned to donepezil (p = 0.002) and a similar pattern was 
observed for executive function  (p = .007).  Participant reported treatment compliance was 98%, and 
toxicities were minimal (mostly Grade 1 and 2; p>.05).  Accrual was robust (62 participants from 16 sites 
in 6 months or 10 participants per month), and 24 -week retention was very good (76%).  There were no 
significant group differences in subjective cognitive functioning or quality of life. There was a suggestion 
that those participants on anti -estrogen hormonal therapy (HT) did somewhat worse than participan ts who 
were not receiving HT (e.g., composite LS mean .2 vs -.05 at 24 weeks, p = .14).  However, there was 
very little evidence that the treatment effect differed for those who were and were not receiving HT 
(interaction p -values ranged from .36 to .97 fo r the memory tests and composite). Finally , member sites of 
the WF NCORP Research Base were surveyed before the phase [ADDRESS_1198525] cancer survivors following 
both brain irradiation and chemotherapy.

Page 10 of 54 Correlativ e science: Finding markers of susceptibility  
 
There is wide variability in the severity of CRCD among breast cancer survivors treated with 
chemotherapy. Scores on standardized cognitive tests often range from severely impaired to normal 
levels.  To better  understand and treat CRCD, it will be important to identify markers of susceptibility.  
Factors studied in relation to other diseases associated with cognitive impairment may offer insights into 
CRCD6.  For example, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype , older age , and lower ‘cognitive reserve’  
are all associated with a greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_6237]’s dementia (AD) and of transition from 
mild cognitive impairment to AD and thus may also identify breast cancer survivors who are at greater 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_90356].  
 
APOE genotype  is a multi functional lipoprotein synthesized by [CONTACT_859936] 
a role in neuronal repair after injury. The APOE polymorphism is a risk factor for both Alzheimer’s 
dementia and vascular dementia with carriers of the ε4 allele at higher risk t han non -carriers37, 38.   Ahles 
et al. reported an increased susceptibility to the adverse cognitive effects of chemotherapy among breast 
cancer survivors an average of [ADDRESS_1198526] cancer 
survivors who were ε4 carriers and who r eceived either chemotherapy with or without anti -estrogen 
hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]40. In an exploratory analysis, we propose to examine whether APOE genotype is 
associated with greater cognitive impairment following chemoth erapy.  
 
‘Cognitive reserve’  (CR) refers to acquired compensatory strategies that enhance a person’s cognitive 
and behavioral capacities41, 42.  Individuals with higher CR should have less cognitive impairment because 
of their greater adaptive capacity.  Common proxies for CR are literacy and educational and occupational 
attainment.  Higher levels of CR have been associate d with lower incident rates for age -associated 
cognitive impairment and longer delayed onset of dementia.  CR will be examined as a susceptibility 
factor for CRCD (low CR individuals will have greater cognitive impairment at baseline than high CR 
individua ls).   
 
There are other potential markers of susceptibility and treatment modifiers including telomere length and 
other genotypes (e.g., catechol -O-methyltransferase ). We propose to collect and store blood for analyses 
of genetic and non -genetic factors of  interest in the future  pending outcome of this study .  
 
In summary, CRCD is a common problem following chemotherapy. It can affect various cognitive 
functions (especially memory, executive function and processing speed) and can last for or develop years 
following treatment. Little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms, but it appears that 
chemotherapeutic agents adversely impact the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is heavily involved in 
learning and memory as well as mood.  Treatments t hat enhance hippocampal -dependent functions, 
therefore, may have particular benefit for patients who receive chemotherapy.  At the WF NCORP 
Research Base we have completed two phase [ADDRESS_1198527].

affected by [CONTACT_859937], memory, working memory, executive function 
and verbal fluency. All cognitive testing will be performed by a trained and certified research assistant 
blinded to treatment assignment.  Proposed neurocognitive measures are: H opkins Verbal Learning Test -
Revised  (HVLT ; 10 min)43, 44(Aim 1); Digit Span -Backwards (DST -B; 2 min) and Digit Symbol Coding 
(DSC; 3 min) subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -Revised45; Trail Making Test A & B 
(TMT; 8 min max)46; and the Controlled Oral Word Association test (3 letters; 4 min)47 that has been used 
with cancer patients49 and has non -cancer norms50 (Aim 2).  Each cognitive  measure proposed has 
adequate psychometric properties and has been used in cancer research including large national and 
international clinical trials 51-53.  An alternate version of the HVLT -R word list will be used for screening 
to reduce practice effects.  
 
Patient  Reported Outcomes - Patient -reported outcomes will complemen t the neurocognitive battery.

 [ADDRESS_1198544] a centrally trained and certified examiner.  We recently completed a phase II, 
placebo -controlled, double -blind feasibility study comparing the proposed treatment regimen  (donepezil 
5mg for 6 weeks follo wed by 10mg daily for 18 weeks versus  placebo ) in breast cancer survivors who 
had completed adjuvant chemotherapy 1 -5 years prior to enrollment and who reported cognitive 
dysfunction (WF NCORP Research Base study #[ZIP_CODE]).  The study was open at 16 sites within the WF 
NCORP Research Base.  We enrolled 62 women between 7/24/11 and 1/24/12 for an excellent accrual 
rate of 10.2 patients per month.  Of the women who completed study (76% of those enrolled), self -
reported adherence to study drug was 98% and completion of all assessments was 98% .  Thus, we hav e 
demonstrated that a Phase III clinical trial testing the efficacy of donepezil in comparison to placebo is 
feasible and that we are well positioned to conduct such a trial. There are no other WF NCORP Research 
Base studies currently open or planned that will compete with this study.   
 
Females with a history of breast cancer and who have received prior chemotherapy will be identified by 
[CONTACT_161009], resident, research nurse or study staff  at each participating Research Base NCORP site. 
They may revie w cancer registry and medical chart information to identify patients eligible for this 
protocol. Patients identified will be asked about their interest in participating in a study of the cognitive 
effects of chemotherapy in clinic or by a letter from their  physician informing them about the study, and 
indicating that a research nurse/ study staff  will be calling to tell them more about the study.   Pre-

followed for 36 weeks. After the 36 week study visit, the patient  is no longer followed and data is no 
longer collected from the patient . Accrual is expected to be 7 -10 pati ents per month. A maximum of 276 
patients will be enrolled on this trial. A total N of  276 (138 in each arm) is likely to be enrolled after 
approximately 40 months.   
 
To ensure adequate minority participation, we will identify Minority Base NCORP  sites for recruitment, 
and provide recruitment information to minority community leaders.  
 
5. AGENT ADMINISTRATION  
 
Intervention will be  administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks are 
described in Section 6.2.   
 
5.1 Dose Regimen and Dose Groups  
 
 Donepezil or placebo will be taken once daily by [CONTACT_1966].  
 Weeks 1 - 6 titration from one 5mg tablet of donepezil or one matching placebo tablet orally 
once a day  to two 5mg tablets of donepezil ( 10mg total) or 2 tablets of matching placebo 
orally once a day  x 7-24.weeks.  
 
5.2 Study Agent  Administration   
 
 Drug will be self-administered orally on an outpatient basis.  
 It will be recommended that patients take tablets ( donepezil or placebo) at the same time 
every day. This may be in the morning or evening; with  or without food.  
 Donepezil is provided as a non -dispersible  tablet, therefore the study medication ( donepezil 
and placebo tablets) are over encapsulated  and should be swallowed whole.  
 Patients  may be asked to return completed medication diaries via mail  or in-person study 
visits. 
 For the first 6 weeks of the study patients  will be instructed to take one 5mg tablet of 
donepezil or one matching placebo tablet orally  once per day .   
 At the 6 week study time point, the patient  will be contact[CONTACT_859938].  At 
this tim e the dose may be modified per  Section 5. 6. 
 
5.3 Wash O ut Procedure  
 
There will be a 12-week wash -out period between end of treatment (24 weeks) and the end of follow -up 
(36 weeks) .  The patient  will be evaluated for toxicities  and will complete study assessments at Week [ADDRESS_1198545] performance following withdrawal of 
treatment.   
 
5.4 Contraindications  
 
 Hypersensitivity to donepezil or pi[INVESTIGATOR_859913] . 
 Due to possible metabolism changes when used concomitantly with donepezil, systemic 
Ketoconazole and quinidine are prohibited.  
 Patient must not have any planned therapy (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or 
immunotherapy) while on study for brain and/or extracranial primary/metastatic disease.

All prescription medications and over the counter medications taken by [CONTACT_859939] (brand or generic name) at study time points designated in Section 7.1.  
 
Refer to Section 7.5 for study visits  and study medication criteria  specific to pa tients  taking a moderate 
risk QTc prolong ation  medication that met inclusion criteria 4.1.9 and/or pa tients  taking a moderate risk 
bradycardia causing agent that met inclusion criteria 4.1.10.   
 
Some medications are known to have neurocognitive effects.  Women currently taking donepezil, 
galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, memantine, methylphenidate , dextroamphetamine or any other 
specific cognition enhancing drugs will be excluded from participation in the study.  If cognition 
enhancing drugs have been used in the past, they must not have been used in  the 4 weeks prior to pre-
screening . 
 
Use of stable doses of psychotropic medications ( anti-depressants, anxiolytics, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_624013] , narcotics ) 
are allowed  if the patient whose eligibility is being assessed has been on the medication for at least [ADDRESS_1198546] 4 weeks prior to enrollment  (per section 
4.1.4).    
 
Patients  should not begin taking a cognition enhancing and/or psychotropic medication while on study.  
However, patients  who do begin taking a cog nition enhancing and/or psychotropic medication while on 
study must immediately stop taking the study agent and should continue study follow -up.  The Patient 
Status Form  should be completed.  
 
5.6 Dose Modification  
 
Study patients will take a single oral 5mg tablet of donepezil or one oral tablet of placebo once per day  for 
6 weeks.  At the 6 W eek study time point, the patient  will be contact[CONTACT_859940] .   Patients will be evaluated using a n AE Report Form .  If the 
patient  is tolerating donepezil/placebo and does not present with  any unacceptable toxicities  (grade 3 or 
greater related to study medication) , the donepezil/placebo dose will be increased to two tablets of 
donepezil (10mg total) or two tablets of placebo  orally once per day  starting on Week 7 and continuing 
through Week 24. Patients taking a moderate risk QTc prolongation medication  and/or moderate r isk 
bradycardia causing medication  will have a study visit 3-[ADDRESS_1198547] in-person study visits that will include toxicity 
assessment s at week s 12,  24 and 36.  
 
Patients that do not tolerate one oral tablet (5mg of donepezil or placebo) will discontinue study drug, but 
will continue to be followed on study.   The Patient Status Form should be completed if the patient 
discontinues study drug.  
If donepezil two table ts (10 mg  total) or placebo 2 tablets  is not tolerated after escalation, the treating 
physician should decrease dose to donepezil one 5 mg tablet or one placebo tablet orally once a day for 
the remaining study period.  Any unacceptable drug -related (Grade 3 or greater) toxicities while patient is 
taking one [ADDRESS_1198548] donepezil/placebo

6. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
6.1 Study Agent   
 
Donepezil hydrochloride  is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase available only by 
[CONTACT_50246].  It is currently FDA approved for use in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the 
Alzheimer’s type.  Donepezil hydrochloride is available for oral admini stration in 5 or 10mg film -coated 
tablets.  It is to be stored at room temperature (15 C to 30C).   Donepezil is postulated to exert its 
therapeutic effect by [CONTACT_859943].  The concentration of acetylcholine is increased by 
[CONTACT_859944] i nhibition of its hydrolysis by [CONTACT_663883].   Donepezil has a relative oral bioavailability 
of 100%.  It reaches peak plasma concentrations in 3 to 4 hours.  The elimination half -life is about 70 
hours and steady state is reached within 15 days.  Donepezil is metabolized by [CONTACT_097] 450 isozymes 
2D6and 3A4 and undergoes glucuronidation.  In a small study of patients with cirrhosis, the clearance of 
donepezil was decreased by 20% compared to healthy controls.  In a few patients with severe renal 
impairme nt, the clearance was unchanged compared to healthy controls.  There have been no interactions 
of donepezil with furosemide, digoxin, warfarin, theophylline, or cimetidine.  Inducers of CYP 2D6 and 
CYP 3A4 could increase the rate of elimination of donepezi l but this has not been demonstrated 
clinically.  These drugs include phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], dexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital.  
Ketoconazole and quinidine inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro but it is not known whether there is a 
clinical ef fect.     
 
6.[ADDRESS_1198551] frequent adverse clinical events are due to donepezil’s cholinomimetic effect.  These include 
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  fatigue, insomnia, and muscle cramps.  These are often mild and 
transient, resolving with continuation of the drug.  There are a few more side effects noted when the drug 
is titrated from 5mg to 10mg in one week vs. six weeks.   
 
Common, Some May Be Seriou s (>20% Chance)  
 Diarrhea 5 -15 % dose related  
 Loss of Appetite 2 -8 % dose related  
 Muscle Cramps 3 -8 % 
 Nausea 3 -19 % dose related  
 Trouble in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 2 -14%

the patient’s physician or other health care professional feels that it is in the patient’s best interest to know 
what drug they are taking (active study d rug(s) or placebo), the following procedure should be followed:  
 
 Step 1: During regular business hours (8:00am – 5:00pm EST), the site should contact [CONTACT_859949] (336) 713 -6519 or (336) 713 -6907.  If after 
hours or on the  weekend, t he patient’s physician or a designated health care professional 
should call the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center Physician Access Line (336 -
716-7654) and ask that [CONTACT_412469] , Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_859915], be contact[CONTACT_15608]. In the event [CONTACT_859977] cannot be reached, the PAL operator

Prospective participants will be identified by [CONTACT_859956], a review of cancer registry, 
medical chart information or by [CONTACT_4676]’s response to advertisements or flyers posted in the 
clinics. All potential participants will first be verbally consented by [CONTACT_7939] “May we ask you a 
few questions to determine i f your activities meet the requirements to take part in the study?”  The 
verbal consent process will be documented by [CONTACT_859957] .   If a 
“no” response is given the prospective participant will be thanked for her time and no longer be 
considered possibly eligible.  If a “yes” response is given, the potential participant  will be asked 
the self -reported cognitive problem question “How wou ld you rate the change in your ability to 
think including remembering, organizing your thoughts and speaking since you were first 
diagnosed with cancer? ”  Response choices will be ‘No change or better’, ‘mildly worse’, 
‘moderately worse’, ‘much worse’.  On ly if a potential participant  responds with  “mildly worse ”, 
“moderately worse ” or “ much worse ” will she proceed to the HVLT -R Form 3 Trial 1 .  Study 
staff will administer and score t he HVLT - R Form 3 Trial 1 .  An entry level score of ≤ 7 words 
recalled is required.  Potential participants who score > 7 are not eligible to participate.  All pre -

7.8.[ADDRESS_1198575] one examiner who is trained and certified 
in the administration and scoring of the cognitive battery (neurocognitive tests and 
questionnaires). Traini ng will follow the procedures developed in prior WF NCORP 
neurocognitive studies such as our recently completed Phase II feasibility study trial of donepezil 
in breast cancer survivors previously exposed to chemotherapy. We will train using didactic 
presen tations (describing the purpose and instructions for each test and questionnaire), live and 
video demonstrations of a complete battery administration, live practice sessions supervised by a 
certified examiner and trainer with specific feedback, and a revie w by [CONTACT_859959] -recorded administration. If needed, remediation will occur with review of subsequent 
recorded administrations with corrective feedback. Once the examiner has met study criteria s/he 
will be certified to administer and sc ore the battery at his/her site.  Periodic re -certifications will 
be required. This procedure has been successfully used in our studies of cognitive effects of 
cancer and its treatments as well as by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rapp and his team in large scale, multi -site clinica l 
trials and observational studies (e.g., WHIMS, CoSTAR, SPRINT, Look AHEAD, LIFE, 
MESA).  
 
7.8.[ADDRESS_1198576] -Revised (HVLT -R):  The HVLT -R  measures verbal learning and 
memory.  It consists of a [ADDRESS_1198577] which is read to patients on three successive learning 
trials. Free recall scores ar e recorded for each learning trial.  After a 20 -minute interval during 
which patients complete other non -interfering tasks and questionnaires they are asked to recall the 
target words. Lastly, a yes/no recognition task is then presented in which patients  are asked to 
WF-[ZIP_CODE]  
Amendment 4, Protocol Version Date 06/07 /2019  
Page 27 of 54 identify all target words by [CONTACT_182755] “yes,” and to reject 12 non -target words by [CONTACT_182755] 
“no”.  Test -retest reliability of the HVLT -R is quite good.  The test is brief, taking only 10 
minutes to administer, and it is well -tolerated by [CONTACT_859960] (geriatric and dementia) 
populations. Scores for immediate recall (total of three trials), delayed recall (total number of 
words recalled after 20 minutes), and recognition (total number of words correctly identified) will 
be the variables derived  from the HVLT -R.  There are [ADDRESS_1198578], Parts A & B  (TMT -A, TMT -B):  Part A of the TMT measures attention and 
visual motor skills and processing speed and requires patients to connect 25 numbered circles in 
the proper sequence (1 -2-3-…) as quickly as possible. TMT -B is similar except patients  are 
required to connect dots in an alternating numerical and alphabetical sequence (1 -A-2-B-…). 
TMT -B with its added complexity and set shifting requirements is a widely used measure of 
executive function. The score for TMT -A and TMT -B is the total time in seconds requ ired to 
complete the task. Scores can also be generated for number of errors and number of circles 
correctly connected.  
 
Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA) :  The COWA measures speed of mental 
processing, verbal fluency, and executive function. Patients  are asked to name [CONTACT_859975] a specified letter.  A total of three trials are administered, each with a 
different letter (F -A-S).  The score on the COWA is the total number of words named across the 
three trials min us repetitions.  
 
Digit Span Test -Backwards (DST -B):  The DST -B assesses attention and working memory.  It 
requires respondents to repeat back in reverse order spans of numbers.  Seven pairs of spans of 
increasing lengths are presented and repeated.  A tota l score is the number of correctly repeated 
spans.  
 
Digit Symbol Coding :  The DSC test measures processing speed. It requires respondents to 
transcribe symbols (e.g., >) associated with a number (0 -9) into empty boxes beneath a series of 
randomly ordered numbers. Total score is number of correctly transcribed symbols in 2 minu tes. 
Scores range from 0 -133. 
 
7.8.3 Cognitive Reserve  
 
Shipley Institute of Living Scale -Version 2 Vocabulary :  This vocabulary test requires 
respondents to read a target word and select one of four words that most closely means the same 
thing. Score it total correct of 40 items. This provides an assessment of premorbid intellectual 
functioning comparable to a verba l IQ and thus is a proxy for cognitive reserve . It will be 
administered only at baseline.  
 
7.8.4 Patient  Reported Outcomes (PRO) Assessment  
 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Cognition (Version 3) :  The FACT -Cog is a validated 
self-report questionnaire tha t assesses patients’ perceptions of their cognitive function and the 
impact of cognitive problems on overall quality of life over the prior [ADDRESS_1198579] -Cog 
(Version 3) has 37 items grouped into four subscales —Perceived Cognitive Impairments (PI; 20 
items, 18 scored), Comments from Others (CO; 4 items), Perceived Cognitive Abilities (PA; 9 
items) and Impact on Quality of Life (IQOL; 4 items). For each subscale items are scored on a 
Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 4 (Several times a day). Negative ly worded items are

Amendment 4, Protocol Version Date 06/07 /[ADDRESS_1198580] better cognitive functioning 
and less impairment.  
 
Personal Health Questionnaire -9 Depression scale :  The PHQ -9 is a widely used self -report scale 
for assessing depression severity. It has 9 items assessing cardinal features of major depression 
which are rated from zero (“Not at all”) to 5 (“nearly every day”).    
 
PROMIS 7 -item Fatigue Scale :  This self -report scale assesses fatigue.  
 
PROMIS 8 -item Sleep Disturbance Scale :  Self-reported sleep disturbance will be measured with 
the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale.  
 
8 Off-Agent/Off -Study  
 
8.1 Off Agent  Criteria  
 
Patients  may stop taking study agent for one or more of the following reasons: completed the 
protocol -prescribed intervention, adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), inadequate 
agent supply, refusal to continue with study procedures, the need for contr aindicated concomitant 
medications, medical contraindication, disease progression, death or treating physician decision.  
Date and reason off agent should be documented on the Patient Status Form .  Reasons that are not 
specified on the form should be coded as ‘Other’ and a brief description provided.  Patients who 
go off -agent must be followed for a dverse events (AEs) for up to  [ADDRESS_1198581] 
treatment.  
Note that patients who go off -agent should be encouraged to stay in the study and provide data at  
the regularly scheduled visits.  
8.2 Off Study Criteria  
 
Patients  may go ‘off -study’ for one or more of the following reasons: the protocol intervention 
and any protocol -required follow -up period is completed, AE/SAE, lost to follow -up, refusal to 
continue with study procedures, the need for contraindicated concomitant medication, medical 
contraindication, disease progression, withdraw consent, death, determination of ineligibility 
(including screen failure), pregnancy, or treating physician decision.  
 
Any patient  with a cancer recurrence must be evaluated by [CONTACT_215321] g physician and followed by 
a discussion with  the Wake Forest NCORP Research Base Study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_859917] -study criteria .  
 
Note that a patient is not automatically taken off -study if they refuse further t reatment.  In fact, 
these patients should be encouraged to remain in the study and provide data at their regularly 
scheduled visits.  Date and reason off -study should be documented on the Patient Status Form .  
Reasons that are not specified on the form sho uld be coded as ‘Other’ and a brief description 
provided.  
 
A final eval uation of the patient may be performed if/when they withdraw  from the study.  If a 
patient decides to discontinue participation in study  (withdraw)  at any time prior to study 
completion, the patient should be asked to complete the entire battery of neurocognitive tests and 
forms prior to withdrawing from the study.  This should be completed u sing the next

Amendment 4, Protocol Version Date 06/07 /2019  
Page 30 of 54 symptom, or disease temporally associated with participation in a study, whethe r or not related to that 
participation. This includes all deaths that occur while a patient is on a study.  
 
Please note that all abnormal clinical laboratory values that are determined to be of clinical significance 
based on a physician’s assessment are to  be reported as AEs. Those labs determined to be of no clinical 
significance or of unknown clinical significance (per the physician’s assessment) should not be reported 
as AEs. Any lab value of unknown clinical significance should continue to be investigat ed/followed -up 
further for a final determination, if possible . 
 
A list of AEs that have occurred or might occur can be found in Section 6.[ADDRESS_1198584] be recorded on the AE Report Form  whethe r or not related to study agent  as 
detailed below.  
 
The prompt reporting of adverse events is the responsibility of each investigator engaged in 
clinical research, as required by [CONTACT_280087] . 
 
10.1.2  AE Data Elements:  
 
The following data elements are required for AE reporting.

10.1.4  Assessment of relationship of AE to treatment  
  
The possibility that the AE is related to study agent will be classified as one of the following 
attribution: Unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, definite.  
 
Attribution:  An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and study 
agent/intervention, using the following categories.  
 
ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the study agent (or 
product)/intervention  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to study agent 
/intervention  
Possible  The AE may be related to study agent/intervention  
Probable  The AE is likely related to study agent/intervention  
Definite  The AE is clearly related to study agent/intervention

Page 32 of 54 10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  A serious adverse event is defined by [CONTACT_5151] 21 CFR §312.32  as any 
adverse medical event (experience) that results in at least one of the outcomes listed below:  
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening 
 Requires i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909] 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to perform normal 
life functions  
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69682], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ): For AE reporting purposes, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859922] 24 hours.   
 
10.3 Reporting for Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
All adverse events, whether observed by [CONTACT_532686], elicited from or volunteered by [CONTACT_4677] , should be documented. Each adverse event will include the date of onset, date of resolution, 
severity, and  the relationship to the study agent or intervention, and any action taken with respect to the 
study agent or intervention . 
 
 Donepezil (Aricept®) is a widely used medication taken routinely on an outpatient basis. An 
identical regimen was used in Wake Forest phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In both studies 
tolerance of donepezil was quite good. Side effects are well documented, therefore Grade 1 
and 2 adverse events (AEs) will not be collected.  
 All expected adverse events (AEs) grade 3 and unexpected that are unrelated or unlikely 
adverse events (AEs) grade 3 will also not be collected.  
 All expected adverse events (AEs) grade 4  will also not be collected.  
 All other adverse events will be reported to the Wake Forest  NCORP Research Base using  
the AE Report Form . Serious adverse events requiring expedited reporting via CTEP -AERS 
are described below.   Serious adverse events not requiring expedited reporting through 
CTEP -AERS should  be entered into AE Report Form  within [ADDRESS_1198586] NCORP Research Base . 
 Site staff and/or Principal Investigators will also notify WF NCORP Research Base via AE 
Report Form  and report to CTEP -AERS within 24 hours of discovering the details of all 
unexpected severe, life -threatening (grade 4) that are possible, probably or definitely 
related to the drug and/or  all fatal adverse events (grade 5).  
 All recorded adverse events reported to the Wake Forest NCORP Research Base will be 
reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Commit tee

11.2 Case Report Forms  
 
Participant data will be collected using protocol -specific case report forms (CRF) .  
 
11.3 Source Documents  
 
Source documents are the original signed and dated records of participant information (e.g.,  the medical 
record, shadow chart) which may include electronic documents containing all the information  related to a 
participant’s protocol participation. Source documents are used to verify the integrity of the  study data, to 
verify participant eligibility, and to verify that mandatory protocol procedures were  followed. An 
investigator and other  designated staff are required to prepare and maintain adequate and  accurate 
documentation that records all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation for each  
individual participating in the study. All data recorded in the research record (including data recorded on  
CRFs) must originate in the participant’s medical record, study record, or other official document sources.  
 
Source documents substantiate CRF information. All participant case records (e.g., flow  sheets, clinical 
records, physi cian notes , correspondence) must adhere to the following standards:  
 
 Clearly labeled in accordance with HIPAA practices so that they can be associated  with a 
particular participant or PID;  
 Legibly written in ink;  
 Signed and dated in a real time basis by [CONTACT_859962]; and  
 Correction liquid or tape must not be used in source documents or on CRFs.  
 Corrections are made by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the error. Do not obliterate the  original 
entry. Insert the correct information, initial, and date the entry.  
 
All laboratory reports, pathology reports, x -rays, imaging study and scans must have:  
 
 Complete identifying information (name [CONTACT_859976],  
analyzing, and/or reporting the res ults of the test); and  
 Range of normal values for each result listed.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
A randomized, placebo controlled, double -blind, p arallel group Phase [ADDRESS_1198593] of 24 weeks of donepezil on cognitive function (memory) in breast cancer survivors who report 
having cognitive dysfunction and demonstrate memory impairment [ADDRESS_1198594] chemotherapy.  Patient s 
who meet the eligibility criteria will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<50, 50 -59, 60 -69, ≥70) and randomized to 
donepezil or placebo with equal probability.  The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effect of 
donepezil on memory as quantified by [CONTACT_941] H VLT -R Immediate Recall score.  Secondary objectives will 
be to assess the impact of donepezil on i) executive functions : Trail Making Test B/A; working memory: 
Digit Span Backward; processing speed : Digit Symbol Coding ; verbal fluency: COWA) ; and self -
reported cognitive problems (FACT Cog) and iii) toxicities and adverse events. For exploratory aims 5 
and 6, we will assess the treatment interaction effects for  APOE genotype and cognitive reserve.   
 
The measures used to quantify these outcomes are described above.  Estimates of treatment efficacy will 
be obtained using the ‘intent to treat’ approach. That is, all randomized participants will be used in the 
analyses, regardless of whether or not the participants were treated according to  protocol.  
 
12.2 Sample  Size 
 
For design purposes, we will base our sample size on data collected in our recently completed phase 2 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (feasibility) study.  Baseline means and adjusted post -randomization standard deviations (obtained 
from ANCOVA models using the baseline and 24 week data) are shown below in Table 1, along with the 
estimates of the treatment effects.   These are provided for the overall sample and for those participants 
who had lower memory scores at baseline.

Our primary outcome variable will be a memory score as quantified by [CONTACT_156782] -R Immediate Recall 
(total of 3 trials).  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the adjusted post -randomization standard deviation was 4.33 (SD of 
the outcome at 24 weeks, adjusted for its correlat ion with the baseline level) and the difference (SE) was 
2.61 (1.32) (p=.03).  In the subgroup of participants with poor initial memory scores, the adjusted post -
randomization standard deviation was 4.26 and the difference (SE) was 4.88 (1.57) (p<.01).   Assuming 
that standard deviations will be similar in the proposed study and equal in the two groups, the sample 
sizes required to detect mean differences between groups of 1 to 3 words with 80% and 90% power are 
shown in Table 2, assuming a 5% two -sided lev el of significance.  These calculations use data from the 
subgroup of participants with poor initial memory scores and assume a single stage design will be 
implemented, an ANCOVA model will be used to compare the treatment arms, and that 73% of the 
partici pants will have 24 week data (25% drop -out and 2% missing data, based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] #[ZIP_CODE]).

12.3 Randomization and Stratification  
 
Participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<50, 50 -59, 60 -69, ≥70) and assigned with equal probability to 
donepezil or placebo using variably sized permuted block randomization. Bl ock sizes will be chosen 
randomly to ensure that future assignments cannot be inferred from previous assignments.  Treatment 
assignments will be generated using nQuery Advisor 7.0 and incorporated into the randomization table in 
our enrollment  facility whi ch is accessible to the site via the internet 24/7. Participants, investigators, 
research staff, and statisticians will all be blinded to treatment assignment. Only RxCrossroads by

12.4 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary outcome, HVLT_IR is a continuous variable that will be measured at baseline, 12, 24 (end of 
treatment) and 36 weeks. This outcome will be analyzed using a mixed effects repeated measures analysis 
of covariance (RMANCOVA) model which includes tr eatment arm, time, the time*treatment interaction, 
the baseline levels of the outcomes, and the stratification factors as covariates, the latter included to 
ensure that the analysis matches the design. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to acco unt for 
the within participant correlation over time.  The major hypothesis will be assessed using a linear contrast 
to test the significance of the group effect at [ADDRESS_1198599] squares means and 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided for each outco me, stratified by [CONTACT_859967], and for the difference 
between treatment arms at each time.  
 
Subsequent RMANCOVA models that include several additional pre -specified, baseline covariates will be 
performed as a sensitivity analysis to the primary  analysis. These additional covariates have been selected 
as those that are highly prognostic of cognitive outcomes and include education, race/ethnicity, fatigue, 
depressive symptom severity, and sleep quality (and APOE genotype and cognitive reserve for exploratory 
aims). Through inclusion of these additional covariates, we will correct for chance imbalances in pre -
specified important prognostic variables and account for that part of the var iability in the outcome measure  
that is due to the covariates, thu s improving the precision of the treatment effect.  Additionally, to address 
our tertiary exploratory objectives, we will include covariate by [CONTACT_859968], thus allowing the determination of whether the effect of donepezil differs 
based on the level of the covariates.  One model will be fit that includes all the covariates and their 
interactions with treatment. Non -significant interactions will be remo ved from the model . Regression 
diagnostics , residual plots, and exploratory analyses will be done to identify appropriate transformations 
for the variables in these analyses. Order of priority in choosing a transformation will be to satisfy the 1) 
linearity assumption, 2) homogeneity of variances assumption, and 3) normality assumption.  Interim 
analyses will be undertaken after 1/[ADDRESS_1198600] been accrued and followed for 24 weeks.  
Results of the interim analysis will be compared to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859925].  
 
12.5 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The secondary outcomes include additional neurocognitive measures as well as patient reported outcomes 
such as self -report cognitive function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression (see Sect ion 7.2).  These 
outcomes are primarily continuous variables that will be measured at baseline, 12, 24 (end of treatment) 
and [ADDRESS_1198601] on the outcomes using the SAS multiple imputation 
procedures. Both the mixed models and imputation analyses assume participants are missing at random,

size (2 76 vs 266), it does have a smaller expected sample size compared to that of a single stage design 
under the alternative hypothesis.  Under the null hypothesis, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_859927] e is 
2%, and the expected sample size is approximately 2 73.  Under the alternative hypothesis, the probability 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_30492] 46%, and the expected sample size is approximately 21 3. 
 
13. SITE REGISTRATION  
 
CTEP Investigator Registration Procedures  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy require all 
individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew their registration annually.  To 
register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) account at https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam .  In addition, persons with a registratio n 
type of Investigator (IVR), Non -Physician Investigator (NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6731]), or Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., clinical site 
staff requiring write access to OPEN, RAVE, or TRIAD or acting as a primary site contact) must 
complete their annual registration using CTEP’s web -based Registration and Credential Repository

Appendix E – Guidelines for Reconsenting Patients  
(A Result of Changes per Amendment 3, Released 5/16/2019)  
 
1) All Patients:  
 
a. All patients currently on study should be reconsented to make them aware of 
potential interactions of study drug and certain concurrently taken medications  
 
b. All patients still receiving study drug  will require an E CG to rule out unrecognized 
QTc prolonga tion or bradycardia  
 
2) Patients currently taking the study drug and a moderate risk QTc prolongation medication  
(reference Appendix A) : 
 
a. Patients taking the study drug and a moderate risk QTc prolongation medication 
(reference Appendix A) should be notified of the new amendment requirements and 
reconsented immediately. These patients will receive an ECG and heart rate 
assessment at the time of reconsent as per 1b above.  
 
i. Reconsented patients who have an acceptable  QTc interval (< 500ms) on 
their ECG and who a re within the first 6 weeks  of study drug (Baseline – 6 
Week) should refer to section 7.[ADDRESS_1198629] an acceptable  QTc interval (< 500ms) on 
their ECG and who are beyond the study drug dose increase time point  (6 
Week) will not require any further cardiac monitoring  
iii. Reconsented patients who have an unacceptable  QTc interval (≥ 500ms) on 
their ECG and who are within the first 6 weeks of study drug  (Baseline – 6 
Week) should stop study drug and be followed as per protocol guidelines  
iv. Reconsented patients who have an unacceptable  QTc interval (≥ 500ms) on 
their ECG and who are beyond the study drug dose increase time point  (6 
Week) may have the dose of study drug reduced by [CONTACT_2016] (i.e. back to initial 
dose level of study drug). Such a patient would then require repeat E CG 
testing in 3 -7 days at which time they would be allowed to continue on 
reduced dose of study drug (if QT c is < 500ms) or be taken off the study 
drug and followed per protocol guidelines (if QTc ≥ 500ms).  
 
3) Patients currently taking the study drug and a moderate risk bradycardia -causing agent  
(reference Appendix B) :  
 
a. Patients taking the study drug and a moderate risk bradycardia -causing agent 
(reference Appendix B) should be notified of the new amendment requirements and 
reconsented immediately. These patients should receive a heart rate assessment at the 
time of reconsent (use the E CG required as per 1b above).  
 
i. Reconsented patients who have an acceptable  heart rate (≥ 55) and who are 
within the first 6 weeks  of study drug (Baseline – 6 Week) should refer to 
section 7.5 in the protocol for timing of additional heart rate monitoring 
required in the ame nded protocol.  
WF-[ZIP_CODE]  
Amendment 4, Protocol Version Date 06/07 /[ADDRESS_1198630] an acceptable  heart rate (≥ 55) and who are 
beyond the study drug dose increase time point  (6 Week) will not require 
any further heart rate monitoring . 
iii. Reconsented patients who have an unacceptable  heart rate ( < 55) and who 
are within the first 6 weeks of study drug  (Baseline – 6 Week) should stop 
study drug and be followed as per protocol guidelines . 
iv. Reconsented patients who have an unacceptable  heart rate (< 55) and who 
are beyond the study drug dose increase time point  (6 Week) may have 
the dose of study drug reduced by [CONTACT_2016] (i.e. back to initial dose level of study

at which time they would be allowed to continue on reduced dose of study 
drug (heart rate ≥ 55) or be taken off the study drug and followed per protocol 
guidelines (if heart rate < 55). 
 
The results of these ECG and heart rate assessments, along with the date of the assessment, should be 
recorded on the Cardiac Monitoring Form under Other Assessment and should be  submitted to the WF 
NCORP RB.

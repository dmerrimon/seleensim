Clinical Phase  Phase I ia 
Site Investigators  PSG Site Investigators  
Study Centers  25 sites located in the US  
Study Period  Planned e nrollment duration : approximately six (6) months  for each cohort.  
Duration of post randomization follow up:  
 Cohort 1 (moderate to advanced PD ): Six (6) months  
 Cohort 2 ( early/ de novo PD): Twelve (12) months  
N Participant s  Cohort 1: N=75 randomized 1:1:1  to once daily dose of nilotinib or 
placebo (150mg: 300mg  : placebo)  
 Cohort 2: N=60 randomized 2:1 to once daily dose of nilotinib or placebo 
(the selected  dose from cohort 1: placebo) . Randomization in this cohort 
will not commence unless a safe & tolerab le dose is determined from 
Cohort 1.  
Study Rationale  A small number of cell and animal models suggest that nilotinib may 
positively affect the alpha ( α) -synuclein pathology observed in PD1-8. A 
small open -label clinical study that lacked a placebo control group tested 
the safety  and tolerability of nilotinib in PD  and dementia  with Lewy body 
(DLB) patients for the first time and explored its efficacy 9. Although 
preliminary data appear promising, the study design precludes firm 
conclusions about safety, tolerability, optimal dose or effi cacy10. Nilotinib 
is approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA ) for certain types 
of leukemia but not for PD. An opportunity exists to rigorously establish 
the safety, tolerability as well as optimal dose, o f nilotinib to enable 
future definitive efficacy studies in PD patients.  
Primary Study Objective  To assess the safety and tolerability of the daily oral administration of 
nilotinib (150 -300mg once daily) in moderate/advanced and early/de novo 
PD participa nts. 
Key Secondary 
Objective  
(Moderate/Advanced 
Cohort)  To conduct a futility analysis within each treated group  in Cohort I . This 
futility analysis will  compar e the observed change in MDS -UPDRS part III 
between baseline and 6 months to the observed chang e from the 
clintrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] nilotinib study in order to determine whether 
we can  rule out the large change previously reported  – i.e., declare 
“futility” . 
Secondary Objectives   To establish the degree of symptomatic effect of nilotinib as measure d 
by [CONTACT_825651] -UPDRS part III between 1) baseline and Visit 2 
(1 month) and 2) final visit on study drug and 30 days off study drug in 
cohorts 1 and 2.

Date: 21 Feb 2018   To explore the impact of nilotinib on progression of PD disability as 
measured by [CONTACT_825652] -UPDRS  Part III in the defined 
medications OFF state in cohort 1 (moderate/advanced  PD) between 
baseline and 6 months . 
 To establish the impact of nilotinib on progression of PD disability as 
measured by [CONTACT_825652] -UPDRS  Part III score in  Cohort 
2 (early/ de novo  PD) between baseline and 12 months or time of 
initiation of symptomatic therapy ( ST), whichever comes first.  
Exploratory  Clinical Measures  
The change  in the following  measures  of disability, quality of life and 
functional status from  baseline  to final visit will be analyzed:  
Motor  disability  
 The change  in MDS -UPDRS total score. For participants on ST, MDS -
UPDRS part III assessments will be collected  in the defined medications 
OFF (approximately [ADDRESS_1144773] dose) and ON (based on  the 
participant/site investigator defined best ON and/or approximately [ADDRESS_1144774]) state 
 The change  in the ambulatory  capacity  (sum  of 5 MDS -UPDRS  
questions: (falling,  freezing,  walking,  gait, postural  stabil ity) 
 Analysis  of ST utilization  as measured  by [CONTACT_825653] 
 Severity  of motor  complications  as measured  by [CONTACT_274657] -UPDRS  IV 
subscale  (complications  of thera py) 
 
Cognitive disability  
 The change  in the cognitive  function  as measured  by [CONTACT_825654]  – 2 (DRS -2)  
 
Sleep function  
 The change in sleep quality as measured by [CONTACT_328162]’s Disease

Blindedness and Treatment Expectations assessments  
 Questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_825655] (PK) and Pharmacodynamics:  
o To determine the serum PK of nilotinib in p atients with PD . 
o To investigate the ability of nilotinib to cross the blood brain barrier 
in patients at a dose(s) that is tolerable and safe as measured by 
[CONTACT_2715]-dependent increases in unbound nilotinib concentrations in the 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] ( CSF). 
o To investigate factors that could affect the PK of nilotinib such as 
age, sex, PD severity, race/ethnicity.  
o To investigate the ability of nilotinib to engage its known molecular 
target(s) at a dose that is tolerable and safe  as measured by 
[CONTACT_825656] y inhibition in the serum and CSF ( including 
but not limited to reduction in phospho -cAbl  tyrosine kinase ). 
o To investigate the relationship between nilotinib exposures in serum  
and CSF with its ability to en gage known molecular target(s) 
[measured by [CONTACT_825657] 
(including but not limited  to reduction in phosphor -cAbl) .  
To explore impact of nilotinib on:  
o Dopaminergic system as measured by [CONTACT_825658] (e.g., homovanilic acid (HVA) level)  
o Other biomarkers linked to potential mec hanism of 
neuroprotection (including but not limited to  CSF α -synuclein,  
total tau, phosphorylated -tau, etc.)

Route and Dosage Form  Nilotinib versus matching placebo administered orally QD  
Dosage  Nilotinib 150mg, 300mg an d matching placebo  
Duration of Treatment  Cohort 1 = 6 months  
Cohort 2 = 12 months  
Primary Outcome 
Measure(s)  
 
 To establish the safety and tolerability of nilotinib (150mg and 300mg 
orally  QD) versus placebo in PD patients (moderate/advanced & early/de 
novo) 
 Tolerability will be judged by [CONTACT_825659] s enrolled in 
a dosage group able to complete the study on their originally assigned 
dosage. Tolerability of each active arm will be compared to placebo 
group.  
Safety will be primarily assess ed based on a direct comparison of 
treatment -related serious adverse events across the treatment groups.   
Sample Size 
Considerations  We assumed at least 90% of participant s on placebo will meet definition of 
“tolerability” and determined required sample size to detect an absolute 
difference of 30% with respect to tolerability for active treatment arms 
versus placebo (in other words if 60% or fewer participant s on an active 
treatment arm meet the stated definition of tolerability). Under this 
assumption an d considering a one -sided test with alpha = 0.05, a total of 25 
participant s per group provides 80% power for the moderate/advanced 
cohort.  Similarly, a sample size of 40 participant s on the selected dose and 
20 participant s on placebo for the early/de no vo second cohort provides 
similar power. With three groups in the moderate/advanced initial cohort, 
and two groups in the early/de novo second cohort, this leads to a total 
sample size of 135 participant s.

Date: 21 Feb 2018  group was 7.0 – with a standard deviation of 12.9.  Using these estimates, 
we computed the power of the currently proposed study to detect “futility” 
based on comparisons of the change within the dosage groups themselves.  
Converting from  the UPDRS used in the Pagan et al study9, to the MDS -
UPDRS proposed for th is study, we will test the following hypothesis in 
the 150mg group:  
H0: δ ≤ -9.8 (7 x 1.4)  vs. H A: δ > -9.[ADDRESS_1144783].  Based on these assumptions, if  the 
observed reduction is half that observed in the prior study ( -3.5), then the 
study has marginal power (52%) to declare futility.  If there is no observed 
reduction associated with treatment, the study has 92% power to declare 
futility.  Thus, this tes t of futility will have adequate power mainly if the 
direction of effect is in the opposite direction from that observed in the 
previous study (i.e., if there is no reduction, only a potentially smaller 
increase in MDS -UPDRS compared to placebo).  Since bi gger effects were 
observed over 6 months for the 300mg group, the study has adequate 
power for addressing futility in the 300mg group in a similar manner.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1  BACKGROUND    
Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease that affects 1% 
of the population above the age 65 11. The prevalence of PD will increas e substantially in the next 
20 years due to the aging of the population and age -related increase of the incidence of the disease 
12,13.  PD is characterized by [CONTACT_825660] a, rigidity, 
resting tremor and gait dysfunction. PD is associated with a spectrum of non -motor symptoms 
including autonomic, cognitive, mood, sleep dysfunction and sensory abnormalities which are 
intrinsically related to the widespread PD  neuropathologica l process and can in part precede the 
onset of motor manifestations 14. The economic  burden  of PD is estimated to be $23 billion 
annually in US and projected to increase to $[ADDRESS_1144814] productivity and correlates with more advanced stages of the disease signifying the 
importance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_825596] 
16. 
 
Treatment options for PD are limited to symptomatic therapy (ST) geared towards replacement 
of dopamine deficiency 17. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a wide armamentarium of effective ST for early PD, 
management of advanced disease is limited. Availability of an effective disease modifying 
intervention that will slow the progression of the disease wil l have a substantial impact on the 
patients’ quality of life and the economic burden of disease.  
 
As of today there is no single proven neuroprotective agent in PD 18. Tested agents targeted 
various potential mechanisms of PD pathogenesis including oxidative stress (rasagiline, 
selegiline, Vitamin E), mitochondrial dysfunction (Coenzyme Q10, creatine), apoptotic 
mechanism of cell death (caspase inhibitors) and others 19-27. 
 
The defining pathological features of PD include the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons 
in the substantia ni gra-pars compacta and intra -neuronal accumulation of misfolded proteins to 
form Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, where α -synuclein is the major component 28,29. 
Mutations in the gene encoding alpha ( α) -synuclein, SNCA , lead to autosomal dominant PD 
while polymorphisms constitute risk factors for non -familial PD (reviewed by [CONTACT_825661][INVESTIGATOR_20116]30). Thus α -synuclein represents a convergent point between genetic etiology and 
pathology of PD and as such is an attractive target for therapeutic interventions.  
 
Recent genetic, biochemical and pharmacological studies indicate that deficits in the cellular 
pathways involved in autophagy underlie inadequate clearance of misfolded α -synuclein and 
contribute to PD pathogenesi s (reviewed by [CONTACT_825662].; Xilouri et al.,31,32). A class of 
enzymes termed tyrosine kinases an d exemplified by [CONTACT_11339] -receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson 
(c-Abl) are known to induce autophagy33.  In fact, inhibitors of c -Abl have emerged as key 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_825597] (reviewed by [CONTACT_825663], 201034) .

Recent analyses of autopsied tissues from PD patients and animal models of PD show an 
increase in the level of c -Abl as well as increases in the phosphorylation of its protein 
substrates, α -synuclein and parkin in dopaminergic neurons1,3,7,35 -37. Interestingly, parkin is an 
E3 ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme critical for proteasome -mediated protein clearance. Like α -
synuclein, mutations and polymorphisms in the parkin  gene also lead to familial PD and 
represent risk factors of sporadic PD, respectively38. More importantly, inhibition of c -Abl by 
[CONTACT_180258], a drug used for the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia ( CML ), ame liorated 
α -synuclein pathology and rescued dopamine neuronal loss in mouse models of PD1,3. Further 
support for a critical role of c -Abl in inducing α -synuclein -mediated PD pathogenesis was 
recently provided by [CONTACT_825664] i et al. 39. Using mouse genetic models they demonstrated that 
deletion of the gene encoding c -Abl reduced α -synuclein aggregation and neurobehavioral 
deficits whereas overexpression of the constitutively active c -Abl accelerated α -synuclein 
aggregation, neuropathology, and neurobehavioral deficits. Thus the first ste ps towards the 
development of c -Abl targeted cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_825598]9.  
 
1.2 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
Nilotinib experience in PD population  
To date, the  safety and tolerability of nilotinib in PD and Dementia with Lew y Bod ies (DLB ) 
population have only been studied in a single small open label clinical study 9. The primary 
objective of the study was safety and tolerabi lity with the secondary objectives of target 
engagement and pharmacokinetics (PK) and exploratory clinical outcomes. The study recruited 
12 participant s with advanced PD, PD dementia  (PDD)  and Lewy body dementia  who were 
randomized to nilotinib 150mg versu s 300mg once daily in an open label fashion and were 
followed for 6 months.  
 
Thirty  patients  were  screened  and twelve  late stage  (Hoehn  and Yahr  3-5) PD, PDD  or DLB  
participants  were  randomized  into 150mg  (N=5)  or 300mg   (N=7)  groups  and received  oral 
daily doses  of nilotinib  for 24 weeks  with 3 months  follow  up. Eighteen  patients  failed  
screening  due to cardiovascular  disease,  infarcts,  corrected QT ( QTc) interval  >450ms  or 
excluded  medications  (i.e. warfarin ). One participant  was withdrawn  from  the study  due to 
serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  and another  discontinued  at 5 months  due to increased  caregiver  
burden.  Ten participant s completed  the 24-week  study  and returned  for a follow  up visit (week  
36). One participant  did not follow  up at week  36. 
 
Clinical outcomes included Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) and Mini Mental 
Status Exams  (MMSE) . Motor symptoms were monitored with UPDRS. The UPDRS scores were 
obtained  at 1-4 hours  after dosing  with nilotinib.  An average  decrease  of 3.4 points  and 
3.6 points  in UPDRS -III (motor)  was observed  at six months  (week  24) compared  to baseline  
with 150mg  and 300mg  nilotinib , respectively.  These  effects  were  reversed  at 36-week

observed  at 6 months  in the 150mg  and 300mg groups,  respectively.  The change  in UPDRS was 
progressive  throughout  the 6 months  (24 weeks)  trial, and was reversed  in participants  in the 
follow  up visit at [ADDRESS_1144815]  participants  experienced  incre ased psychotic  symptoms  
(hallucination,  paranoia,  agitation,  etc.) and some  dyskinesia .  
 
Cognitive performance was monitored with MMSE  throughout  all visits.  An average  increase  
of 3.85 and 3.5 points  in MMSE  was observed  at six months  (24 weeks)  compared  to 
baseline  with 150mg  and 300mg  nilotinib , respectively.  The increase  in MMSE  scores  was 
incremental  throughout  the 24-week  treatment,  and returned  to baseline  at the 36-week  follow  
up visit.  The Scales  for Outcomes  in Parkinson’s  Disease -Cognition  (SCOP A-Cog)  test also 
show ed an average  increase  of 1.85 and 2 points  at six months compared  to baseline  with 
150mg  and 300mg  nilotinib , respectively.  
 
While the investigators concluded that nilotinib  at tested doses was safe and tolerable in PD 
population, one  participant  had a serious cardiac event during the study and two others had QT 
prolongation (both are within the spectrum of the known nilotinib related adverse events and 
QT prolongation is reflected in the drug black box warning). The authors reported c entral 
nervous system penetration of unbound nilotinib , with the Cerebral Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17106] ( CSF):plasma 
ratio of 12% and 5 % with 300mg and 150mg dose respectively at [ADDRESS_1144816] to th e secondary 
outcomes of target engagement, the authors reported reduction of phosphor ylated A bl by 30 % 
with both doses of nilotinib . In addition, the authors reported significant increase in CSF 
dopamine metabolite, homovanilic acid (HVA) in both treatmen t groups and interpreted it as 
potentially reflection of nilotinib induced up regulation and protection of dopamine neurons. 
The authors also reported significant symptomatic benefit of nilotinib with improvement of 
motor disability and cognitive performan ce both of which subsided [ADDRESS_1144817] to be validated and replicated10.  Nilotinib is 
approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA ) for certain types of leukemia but not PD.   
 
An opportunity exists to establish rigorous ly the safety, tolerability  and optimal dosing of 
nilotinib for future efficacy studies in PD patients .

This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled,  parallel group  
study  of nilotinib in participant s with moderate to advanced (Cohort 1) and early/ de novo (Cohort 
2) PD.  The study will  defin e the safety, tolerability, and exploratory clinical and biological 
activity of the chronic administration of nilotinib in participant s with PD .   
 
Participant s in Cohort 1  (moderate/advanced PD ) will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1144825] drug evaluation; whereas 
treatment period from randomization to final “On Treatm ent” visit will be [ADDRESS_1144826] completed  6 
months of their randomized treatment  assignment . The se results will be analyzed to inform  the 
dose chosen for evalu ation in  Cohort 2.  
 
Cohort 2 will treat early/ de novo PD participant s.  Participant s will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio 
to: 
 
•    nilotinib – selected  dose, based on  safety  and tolerability data in  Cohort 1.

Version  4 
Date: [ADDRESS_1144829] that `the data on the safety profile 
of the drug and prior clinical experience with nilotinib were  limited to an advanced PD population 
with cognitive deficits , PDD a or DLB , it was felt prudent to validate and expand the data on 
nilotinib safety and tolerability in the moderately advanced PD population.  It is ex pected that 
tolerability of nilotinib in Cohort 1 will be lower than in Cohort 2 ( early/ de novo PD population).   
Such data are important to establish , provided that nilotinib, if shown to have disease modifying 
benefit, will be administered long -term to PD  patients  across all disease stages . Another important 
objective of the study is to establish the magnitude of potential symptomatic effect of nilotinib 
and dopaminergic therapy interaction. These data will be essential for the design of future disease 
modifying trials .   
 
If shown to be safe and well tolerable, future development of nilotinib will target disease 
modification objectives. Disease modification has historically been tested in cohorts of de novo 
PD population. To pursue future disease modificat ion trials, safety and tolerability of nilotinib 
has to be established in the de novo PD population as well. While we do not expect that the de 
novo population will have a lower tolerability  and safety threshold, th is hypothesis must  be tested. 
In addition , a key pi[INVESTIGATOR_825599] [ADDRESS_1144830] of nilotinib 
versus placebo on the rate of progression in PD disability will be collected .  These data will guide 
the decision to pursu e future clinical evaluation  for that indication as well as provide essential 
data for the power calculations and sample size estimation for future disease modifying trials.

Date: 21 Feb 2018  3.2.3  NILOTINIB  
Nilotinib mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic data  
Nilotinib  (Tasigna®,  AMN107,  [COMPANY_001],  Switzerland)  is a kinase  inhibitor approved by [CONTACT_825673]  (Ph+  CML)  in chronic  phase (CP)  and accelerated  phase  (AP) 
Ph+ CML  in adult patients  resistant to or intolerant to prior  therapy  that included imatinib .  
Nilot inib is available in 150mg and 200mg capsules. The  recommended  dose of nilotinib for 
CML ranges from  300 to 400mg  orally  twice -daily  (600-800mg/day).   
Please use the following link to view the package insert 
https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/sites/www.pharma.us.novartis.com/files/tasigna.pdf  
Nilotinib is  an inhibitor  of the breakpoint cluster region protein  (BCR )-Abl kinase.  Nilotinib 
binds to and stabilizes  the inactive conformation  of the kinase domain of  Abl protein.   
Tasigna (nilotinib)  capsules,  for oral  use, contain  150mg  or 200mg nilotinib base,  anhydrous  
(as hydrochloride,  monohydrate)  with the  following  inactive  ingredients:  colloidal silicon  
dioxide,  crospovidone,  lactose  monohydrate,  magnesium  stearate  and poloxamer  188. The  
capsules  contain  gelatin,  iron oxide (red),  iron oxide (yellow),  iron oxide (black),  and 
titanium dioxide.   Tasigna (nilotinib)  capsules  should be stored  at 25°C (77°F);  excursions  
permitted between  15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F)  
 
 Pharmacokinetics of Nilotinib  
 The absolute  bioavailability  of nilotinib has not been determined.   As compared  to an oral drink 
solution (pH of 1.2 to 1.3) ; relative  bioavailability  of nilotinib capsule is approximately  50%.   
Peak  serum concentrations  of nilotinib  are reached  3 hours  after oral administration.   Steady -
state nilotinib exposure  was dose-dependent with less than dose-proportional  increases  in 
systemic  exposure  at dose levels  higher  than 400mg given  as once -daily  dosing . Steady  state 
exposure  area under the  concentration -time curve (AUC) of  nilotinib with 400mg  twice -daily  
dosing  was 13% higher than with 300mg  twice -daily  dosing.  The average steady  state nilotinib 
trough  and peak concentrations  did not change  over [ADDRESS_1144831]  1 hour  after  
the dose  is taken.  Also avoid  grapefruit  products  and othe r foods  that are known  to inhibit 
CYP3A4  [see Cautionary and Exclusionary Medications in Appendix  2] 
 
 The blood -to-serum  ratio of nilotinib is 0.68. Serum  protein  binding  is approximately  98% 
based on  in vitro  experiments.

Page 41 of 198 
Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  The apparent  elimination half-life estimated  from  the multiple  dose PK studies  with daily  
dosing  was approximately  17 hours.  Inter-patient  variability  in nilotinib AUC  was 32% to 
64%.  Steady  state conditions  were  achieved  by [CONTACT_2006] 8. An increase in serum  exposure  to 
nilotinib between  the first dose and steady  state was approximately  2-fold for  daily  dosing  
and 3.8-fold for twice -daily  dosing.  
 
Main metabolic pathways  identified  in healthy  participant s are oxidation and  hydroxylation.  
CYP3A4 is expected to be the main contributor to oxidati ve metabolism with CYP2C8 also 
making contribution.  In vitro studies show nilotinib to be a competitive inhibitor of 
CYP3A4/5, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and UGT1A1.  Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrate possible 
induction of CYP2B6, 2C8, and 2C9.  Nilotinib  is the main  circulating  component  in the 
serum.  None of the metabolites  contribute significantly  to the  pharmacological  activity  of 
nilotinib.  
 
After  a single  dose of radiolabeled  nilotinib in healthy  participant s, more than 90% of the 
administered  dose was eliminated  within 7 days:  mainly  in feces  (93%  of the dose) . Parent  
drug accounted  for 69% of the  dose. Age,  body  weight,  gender,  or ethnic origin  did not 
significantly  affect  the PK of nilotinib.

To minimize bias on the part of participant s, Site Investigator s, and analysts , the study is  to be 
conducted as a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study. To maintain 
the blind, study drug and placebo will be manufactured as matching capsules , packaged and 
provided in matching containers.

Nilotinib WARNING: QT Prolongation and Sudden Deaths:  
 Nilotinib prolongs the QT interval. Prior to nilotinib administration and periodically, 
monitor for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and correct deficiencies . Obtain 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) to monitor the QTc at baseline, 7 days after initiation, 
and periodically thereafter, and following any dose adjustments.  
 Sudden deaths have been reported in patients receiving nilotinib. Do not use 
nilotinib in patients  with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome.  
 Avoid use of concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. Patient should avoid food 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking 
a nilotinib dose . 
QT P rolongation  
Niloti nib has been shown  to prolong  cardiac  ventricular  repolarization  as measured  by [CONTACT_825675] a concentration -dependent  manner . Prolongation  of the QT 
interval  can result in a type of ventricular  tachycardia called  torsade  de pointe s, which  may 
result  in syncope,  seizure,  and/or  death. ECGs should be  performed  at baseline,  7 days after 
initiation  of nilotinib , and periodically  as clinically  indicated  and following  dose adjustments  
[see SOA ]. 
Nilotinib should not be used in patients w ho have hypokalemia,  hypomagnesemia or long  QT 
syndrome. Before  initiating  nilotinib and periodically,  test electrolyte,  calcium  and 
magnesium  blood levels.  Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be  corrected  prior  to 
initiating  nilotinib and these electrolyte s should be monitored  periodically  during  therapy  
[see SOA].  
Significant  prolongation  of the QT interval  may occur  when nilotinib is inappropriately  taken  
with food and/or  strong CYP3A4  inhibitors  and/or medicinal  products with a known  potential 
to prolong  QT. Therefore,  co-administration  with food must be  avoided  and concomitant use  
with strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors  and/or  medicinal  products  with a known potential  to prolong  
QT should be  avoided  [see appendix )]. The  presence  of hypokalemia  and hypomagnesemia 
may further  prolong  the QT interval  [see Exclusion criteria ]. 
Sudden  Deaths  
Sudden  deaths  have  been  reported  in 0.3% of patients  with CML  treated  with nilotinib in 
clinical  studies of  5,661 patients.  The relative early  occurrence  of some of  these  deaths

marketing reports  of patients  receiving  nilotinib  therapy . With a  median  time on therapy  of 60 
months in the clinical  trial, cardiovascular  events, including  arterial  vascular occlusive  events,  
occurred  in 9.3% and 15.2%  of patients  in the nilotinib  300 and 400mg  bid arms,  
respectively.  These included  cases  of cardiovascular  events  including  ischemic heart disease -
related  cardiac events (5.0%  and 9.4%  in the  nilotinib 300mg and 400mg  bid arms  
respectively,  peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease (3.6%  and 2.9%  in the nilotinib 300mg  and 
400mg bid arms respectively, and  ischemic cerebrovascular  events  (1.4% and  3.2% in the  
nilotinib 300mg and 400mg  bid arms  respectively. If acute signs  or symptoms  of 
cardiovascular  events  occur,  advise  patients  to seek immediate  medical  attention.  The 
cardiovascular  status  of patients  should be evaluated  and cardiovascular  risk factors  should be  
monitored  and activel y managed  during  nilotinib  therapy  according  to standard  guidelines  
[see Exclusion criteria and SOA] . 
Myelosuppression  
Treatment  with nilotinib  can cause Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1144839] 2 months and then monthly  
thereafter,  or as clinically  indicated  [see SOA].  Myelosuppression  was generally  reversible  
and usually  managed  by [CONTACT_825676].   
Pancreatitis and  Elevated Serum  Lipase  
Nilotinib can cause  increases in serum  lipase.  Patients with a previous  history  of pancreatitis  
may be at greater  risk of  elevated  serum lipase. [See Exclusion criteria ]   
Hepatotoxicity  
Nilotinib may result  in hepatotoxicity  as measured  by [CONTACT_825677], AST/ ALT,  and 
alkaline  phosphatase.  Monitor hepatic function  tests monthly  or as clinically  indicated  [see 
SOA]. 
Electrolyte  Abnormalities  
The use of nilotinib  can cause hypophosphatemia,  hypokalemia,  hyperkalemia,  
hypocalcemia,  and hyponatremia.  Correct  electr olyte abnormalities  prior  to initiating  
nilotinib  and during  therapy.  Monitor  these  electrolytes  periodically  during  therapy  [see 
Exclusion criteria and SOA ]. 
Hepatic  Impairment  
Nilotinib exposure  is increased  in patients with impaired  hepatic  function [see Exclusion 
criteria and SOA ].

Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  Hemorrhage  
In a randomized  trial in patients  with newly  diagnosed  Ph+ CML  in chronic  phase comparing  
nilotinib  and imatinib,  Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred  in 1.1%  of patients  in the nilotinib  
300mg bid arm, in 1.8%  patien ts in the  nilotinib 400mg  bid arm, and 0.4%  of patients  in the 
imatinib arm.  GI hemorrhage occurred  in 2.9% and 5.1%  of patients  in the nilotinib 300mg  bid 
and 400mg  bid arms  and in 1.4% of patients  in the imatinib arm, respectively.  Grade 3 or 4 
events  occurred  in 0.7%  and 1.4%  of patients  in the nilotinib 300mg bid and 400mg  bid arms,  
respectively,  and in no patients in the imatinib arm. 
Monitoring  Laboratory  Tests 
Complete  blood counts  should be performed  every  [ADDRESS_1144840] 2 months and then 
monthly thereafter.  Perform  chemistry  panels, including  electrolytes,  calcium,  magnesium,  
liver enzymes,  lipid profile,  and glucose  prior  to therapy  and periodically . ECGs should be  
obtained at baseline,  7 days after initiation  and periodically  thereafter,  as well as following  
dose adjustments  [see Warnings  and Precautions (5.2)].  Monitor lipid profiles  and glucose  
periodically  during  the first year of nilotinib therapy  and at least yearly  during  chronic  therapy. 
Should treatment  with any HMG -CoA reductase  inhibitor (a lipid lowering  agent)  be needed  to 
treat lipid elevations,  evaluate  the potential for a drug-drug interaction  before initiating  therapy  
as certain  HMG -CoA  reductase inhibitors  are metabolized  by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 pathway  [see 
Precautionary/Exclusionary  Drug s Appendix 2 ]. Assess  glucose  levels  before  initiating  
treatment  with nilotinib and monitor during  treatment as clinically  indicated.  If test results  
warrant  therapy,  physician  should follow their local  standards of  practice  and treatment  
guidelines.  
Embryo -Fetal  Toxicity  
There  are no adequate and well controlled  studies of  nilotinib in pregnant  women . Therefore, 
women of  child -bearing  potential will be excluded from the study [see Exclusion criteria ]. 
Fluid  Retention  
In the randomized  trial in patients  with newly  diagnosed Ph+ CML  in chronic phase,  severe 
(Grade 3 or 4)  fluid retention  occurred  in 3.9%  and 2.9%  of patients  receiving  nilotinib,  
300mg bid and 400mg  bid, respectively,  and in 2.5% of  patients  receiving  imatinib.  Monitor  
patients  for signs  of severe  fluid  retention  (e.g.,  unexpected rapid  weight  gain or swelling)  
and for symptoms  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_825603]  (e.g.,  shortness of breath)  during  
nilotinib treatment;  evaluate  etiology  and treat patients  accordingly.  
 
Other warnings and precautions  (discussed in detail  in the  Package Insert ) 
 
Total gastrectomy  
Since  the exposure  of nilotinib is reduced  in patients with total  gastrectomy,  participants with 
gastrectomy will be excluded [see Exclusion criteria)] .

Date: 21 Feb 2018  Lactose Intolerance  
Since  the capsules  contain lactose,  nilotinib is not recommended for patients  with rare 
hereditary  problems of  galactose  intolerance,  severe  lactase  deficiency  with a  severe  degree  
of intolerance  to lactose -containing  products,  or of  glucose -galactose  malabsorption  [see 
Exclusion criteria].  
Musculoskeletal Symptoms after Discontinuation  
Patients taking nilotinib  reported more frequent musculoskeletal symptoms  (e.g., myalgia, 
pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain or musculoskeletal pain during the first year of 
discontinuation of treatment than before discontinuation.  
Adverse events : Clinical trial experience s in CML population  
The data below  reflect  exposure  to nilotinib from a randomized  trial in patients  with newly  
diagnosed  Ph+ CML  in chronic  phase treated  at the recommended  dose of 300mg twice -daily  
(n=279).  The median time on  treatment  in the nilotinib 300mg  twice -daily  group  was 61 
months  (range 0.1 to 71 months). The median  actual  dose intensity  was 593mg/day  in the  
nilotinib 300mg  twice -daily  group.  
The mo st common (>10%) non -hematologic adverse drug reactions were rash, pruritis, 
headache, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, myalgia, and upper abdominal pain. Constipation, diarrhea, 
dry skin, muscle spasms, arthralgia,  abdominal  pain, peripheral  edema,  vomiting, and asthenia  
were  observed  less commonly  (≤10%  and>5%)  and have  been of  mild to moderate  severity,  
manageable  and generally  did not require dose reduction.  
Increase in Fridericia’s correction for QT interval  (QTcF ) >60 msec from  baseline was  
observed  in 1 pa tient (0.4%)  in the  300mg  twice -daily  treatment  group . No patient  had an 
absolute  QTcF  of >[ADDRESS_1144841] common  hematologic  adverse  drug reactions (all grades)  were myelosuppression  
including:  thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia  (15%)  and anemia (8%) . Discontinuation  
due to adverse  reactions,  regardless  of relationship  to study  drug,  was observed  in 10% of 
patients.  
In patients with CML -AP, the most commonly  reported non-hematologic  adverse  drug 
reactions  (≥10%)  were  rash,  pruritus  and fatigue . The common  serious  adverse  drug reactions  
(≥1%  and <10%)  were thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  pneumonia,  
leukopenia,  intracranial  hemorrhage, elevated  lipase and  pyrexia.  
Sudden  deaths  and QT prolongation  were  reported. The  maximum mean  QTcF  change  from  
baseline  at steady -state was 10 msec.  Increase in QTcF  >60 msec from baseline was  observed  
in 4.1% of  the patients  and QTcF  of >500  msec was observed  in 4 patients (<1%)

The spectrum of adverse events ( AEs) reported  in this small  PD population included cases of 
mild confusion and hallucinations as well a s anxiety and ag itation, not reported in CML 
cohorts. Non -serious  AEs included transient  QTc prolongation>450ms  but they returned  to 
normal  QTc range  in subsequent  visits  (one participant  in 150mg  and one in 300mg  group ). 
Participants  in the  150mg  group  reported  three  UTIs, two cases  of pneumonia,  one cold 
virus,  one mild back pain,  one mild headache,  one mild dysgraphia,  one mild left foot drag,  
one mild confusion,  one mild hallucination,  one mild paranoia,  one mild agitation,  one 
moderate  anxiety,  one mild incontinence,  one moderate  itching  and one skin irritation.  
Participants  in the 300mg  group  reported  one incident  of blurry  vision,  one diarrhea,  one 
nausea,  one mild fatigue,  two generalized  weakness,  three  UTIs,  one pneumonia,  one 
weight  loss, one tooth  extraction,  one dizziness,  two mild hallucinations,  one mild 
paranoia,  one mild crying  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865],  one mild urinary  urgency,  one mild cough  and one 
eczematous lesion. With  regard to the laboratory parameters, a total of three  AEs below  
normal  range  of ALT  level  (<100%)  were observed  in the 150mg  group  nilotinib.  Two AEs 
above  normal  range  (>100%),  including  one ALT  and one bilirubin  e l ev a t i o n s  observed  
in the 150mg  group  nilotinib.  Two AEs with transient  increase  of ALT  and one AST  above  
normal  range  (>100%)  were  observed  in the 300mg group nilotinib  but returned  to normal  
by [CONTACT_15691].  
 
Contraindicated Medications  (see Section 8.[ADDRESS_1144843] of 
contraindicated medications  and potential drug interactions )  
Nilotinib is a competitive  inhibitor  of CYP3A4, CYP2C8,  CYP2C9, CYP2D6  and UGT1A1  
in vitro,  potentially  increasing  the concentrations  of drugs  eliminated  by [CONTACT_36918].  In 
vitro  studies  also suggest  that nilotinib may  induce  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, and 
decrease the concentrations  of drugs  which are  eliminated by  [CONTACT_825678].  
Avoid administration  of nilotinib with agents  that may increase  nilotinib exposure (e.g.,  strong  
CYP3A4  inhibitors)  or anti-arrhythmic drugs  (including,  but not limited  to amiodarone,  
disopyramide,  procainamide, quini dine and sotalol)  and other  drugs  that may prolong  QT 
interval  (including,  but not limited to chloroquine,  clarithromycin,  haloperidol, methadone,  
moxifloxacin  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]).

Version  4 
Date: [ADDRESS_1144844] gastric pH 
Nilotinib has pH-dependent  solubility,  with decre ased solubility  at higher  pH. Drugs  such as 
proton pump inhibitors  that inhibit  gastric  acid secretion  to elevate the  gastric  pH may 
decrease the solubility  of nilotinib and  reduce  its bioavailability.  The concomitant use  of 
proton pump inhibitors  with nilotinib  is not  recommended  and is prohibited in this study . 
In healthy  participant s, no significant  change  in nilotinib PK was observed  when a  single  
400mg  dose of nilotinib  was administered  10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine (an 
H2 blocker).  Ther efore,  when  the concurrent  use of a H2 blocker is necessary,  it may  be 
administered  approximately  10 hours before  and approximately  2 hours after the dose of 
nilotinib . 
Administration  of an antacid  (aluminum  hydroxide/magnesium  hydroxide/simethicone)  to 
healthy  participant s, 2 hours before or 2 hours  after a single  400mg dose of nilotinib  did not 
alter nilotinib PK . Therefore,  if necessary,  an antacid  may be administered  approximately  2 
hours before or approximately  2 hours after the dose of nilotinib . 
Food effects  
The bioavailability  of nilotinib is increased  with food; high fat meals increase C max and AUC 
by 112% and 82%, respectively, while a light meal increases C max by 33 – 55% and increase 
AUC by 15 -29%.  Thus , nilotinib must not be taken  with food. No food should be  consumed  
for at least [ADDRESS_1144845] (IRB) approval. All Site Investigator s should be  trained an d 
qualified in the administration of the MDS -UPDRS  and will be required to provide certification 
of training on the MDS -UPDRS  within the last 2 years . Training sessions will be performed at 
the Investigator’s meeting with special emphasis on the primary ou tcome measure s. New sites  
and/or new Site Investigator s identified after the Investigator’s meeting will be trained 
individually. Enrollment will be closed as soon as the target number of participant s are enrolled. 
Information regarding the clinical trial will be posted on multiple websites  including  
clinicaltrials.gov and the Michael J. Fox Foundation ( MJFF ) website , Fox Trial Finder . A 
detailed recruitment plan will be provided . 
 
Once a study site has obtained IRB  approval , they can start identifying pote ntial participants for 
the study .  Participants should be community dwelling.  All participant s asked to participate in 
this trial will be tracked on a Confidential Participant Log, which  is to be kept in a secure

population was selected without bias.   Information regarding how participant s learned about the 
trial, referral sources  will be tracked  in source documents.   
 
Only participant s who meet all the inclusion  and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible 
to participate in the study.  Reasons for ineligibility and reasons for non - participation for 
eligible participant s will be tracked in both source documents and Electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF ) for al l participant s who have signed a consent and are screened for the study.  No 
protocol waivers will be granted for participant s unable to meet eligibility criteria . However, a 
one-time rescreening may be allowed on a case-by-case basis when potential for an 
improvement or recovery of the criteria for ineligibility is possible and the participant  could 
become eligible for enrollment in the study.   Participants may also rescreen if they were 
determined to be a screen failure prior to protocol Amendment 1 and ar e now deemed elegible 
based on Amendment 1 includsion/exclusion criteria.    
 
During or before a screening visit, the Participant  will be thoroughly informed about all aspects 
of the study, including all scheduled visits and activities, and will be able to  ask questions. The 
participant  will be requested to sign and date the informed consent form prior  to undergoing any 
study -specific procedures.  The original signed and dated informed consent form must be 
retained by [CONTACT_825679] a copy must b e provided to the Participant .

6.  SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITI ES 
 
Throughout the study, it is highly recommended that assessments be performed in the same o rder 
as outlined in the Study Procedures section of this protocol  at every visit and, if possible, at a 
similar time of day.  Site staff that have been trained and approved to administer these 
assessments for this study must perform them , per delegation of  authority log . 
 
The Site Investigator is responsible for the overall conduct of the study and for conducting 
specific study assessments to ensure consistency in rating s and performance  over the course of 
the study.   Sub-Investigators will be allowed , provided that there is consistency in the personnel 
performing the ratings over the course of the study  (i.e., MDS -UPDRS is performed by [CONTACT_825680]) . 
 
In this study , the Site Investigator will be responsible for  the following :  
 Determining Participant  eligibility  
 Conducting the physical (medical) and neurological examinations  
 Conducting the MDS -UPDRS Part IA, Part III  and Part IV

6.1  PARTICIPANT  IDENTIFICATION (ID)  NUMBER  
       
A participant  ID Number will be assigned in sequential order by [CONTACT_538168] a list provided to 
the site by [CONTACT_825681] (C TCC).   This 4-digit number will be used to 
identify the participant  on all study forms and safety lab specimens (as appropriate). Research 
specimens will be labeled per protocol (alternate labeling without the participant  ID number, 
such as barcode labels,  may be required to protect confidentiality).  
 
Cohort 1 will enroll participants with moderate to advanced PD.   After all participants in 
Cohort 1 complete the treatment period  (throughV04) , a planned interim analysis will determine 
whether either of the doses are sufficiently safe and tolerated to justify further study.  If so, then 
the study steering committee will select one of the two doses  for Cohort 2.  Cohort 2 will enroll 
early/ de novo PD participants.  Enrollment into Cohort 2 will not begin until /if a dose is 
determined from Cohort 1.

If the need for ST is determined by [CONTACT_825694]  a regularly scheduled study 
visit or safety visit  (per SOA) , the ST visit should be initiated.  Additionally, assessments 
required at specified visits (e.g., PK assessment, lumbar puncture, coagulation parameters) 
must be completed  as well as assessments re quired for the ST visit.  
 
If the need for ST is determined between  scheduled study visits  and the subject has NOT yet 
started taking PD medication(s) , the ST visit should be initiated in place of the regularly scheduled 
visit (see SOA). Note: subjects wil l not be required to return for an additional visit to perform ST 
visit; ST will replace the next scheduled study visit, including safety visits.  
Participants who initiate ST will continue  on study drug and will continue  in the study until the 
Final Visit.   
Initiation of ST is a reportable event and CTCC must be notified.  
 
Assessments should be performed in the order presented below, if possible:  
  Administer MDS -UPDRS  
 Administer MDS -UPDRS Parts I -III 
 Assess Need for ST  
 If participant requires initiation of  ST, an ST visit should be initiated (see SOA).  
 
Assessments specifically required at this scheduled visit must be completed  as well as 
assessments required for the ST visit (see SOA)

Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018   A5-digit Enrollment ID Number will be assigned at the BL (randomization) visit to  confirm 
enrollment and proper receipt of the randomized study drug assignment. The Enrollment ID 
Number will be correspondingly labeled on the respective study drug container  
  
 
 The treatment for each participant will be assigned by a randomized code. A b locked 
randomization scheme will be used to ensure approximately even distribution of participants 
in treatment groups.   
 
 As the participant qualifies for the randomized phase of the study, the Site Investigator or 
Study Coordinator completes the RANDOM p rocess in the Internet accessible Electronic 
EDC system, which will assign to that participant an Enrollment ID  (Randomization Kit) 
Number.  These numbers are assigned in a randomized order, rather than sequentially.  
 
 The randomization algorithm and partic ipant enrollment process will be implemented through 
the EDC system using authenticated, password -protected accounts for each study site.  The 
EDC system will check for participant eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion page entries.  
 
 Once a participant  has been allocated an Enrollment ID Number, this number cannot be 
assigned to another participant.  
 
  
7.7 CODING/EMERGENCY DRU G DISCLOSURE  
   
The Site Investigator or Site Pharmacist (if applicable) will be provided with a sealed code 
envelope for each Enrol lment ID (Randomized Kit Number)  for all kits received from the 
CMSU.   With each supply of Cohort #1 kits and Cohort #2 baseline kits will be tamper evident 
envelopes that are labeled with a randomization number and contain a scratch -off (similar to a 
lottery ticket) treatment disclosure associated with a particular randomization number.  These 
envelopes contain the individual study treatment assignments associated with each kit.  All 
sealed code envelopes will  be collected at the closeout monitoring visit (either on site or 
remotely) at the end of the study and  returned to CMSU  will be inspected to ensure that they 
have not been opened.    
 
Sealed code envelopes should only be opened in emergency situations for reasons of participant 
safety.  Whenever possib le, the Site Investigator should consult with the  Clinical  Monitor   or 
another member of the study team prior to opening the sealed code envelope and “breaking the 
blind”. When the sealed code envelope for a Participant has been opened, the reason must be  fully 
documented detailing the purpo se, date and personnel involved in the source document and entered 
on the case report form. The participant will be withdrawn from further exposure to study drug.

      Participant s will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of the following treatment arms:  
 nilotinib 150mg  
 nilotinib 300mg  
 placebo  
 
 
Rules for drug initiations and titration  
 
The double -blind dosing for the three treatment arms in Cohort 1 will be achieved using a two -
bottle type (Bottle A and Bottle B) approach.  During the two -week dose titration period, 
participant s will take one capsule daily from Bottle A.  After two weeks of titration, participant s 
will continue to take one ca psule daily from Bottle A and add one capsule daily from Bottle B.  
The table below summarizes the contents of Bottles A and B for the 150mg, 300mg and Placebo 
treatment arms.

At their baseline visit, participant s will be dispensed one (1) bottle A and one (1) bottle B. 
Particip ants will initiate study drug at a dosage of 150mg daily or matching placebo (1 capsule 
once daily from bottle A) and titrate to either 150mg daily, 300mg daily or matching placebo (2 
capsules once daily) after the first 2 weeks.  To maintain the blind of the study, participant s will 
take one (1) capsule from bottle A and one (1) capsule from bottle B once daily.  
 
Participant s must remain on one capsule  daily dosage level a   minimum of [ADDRESS_1144964] 
titration to 2 capsules once daily.  Dose up -titration can be delayed at the discretion of the Site 
Investigator  by 2 weeks but has to occur no later than V02 (1 month).  If the participant  is 
unable to up -titrate the dose, this will be considered intolerability and they will remain on 
one capsule daily  for the duration of the study.

will be dispensed an additional one (1) bottle A and one (1) bottle B.  Participant s will continue 
to take one (1) capsule  from each bottle once daily for the remainder of the study.  
 
 
Cohort 2  
 
Participant s will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio into one of the following treatment arms:  
 Selected dose from Cohort 1 based on safety and tolerability (150mg or 300mg)  
 Placebo  
 
 
150m g Dose Option  
 
The double -blind dosing for the two treatment arms in Cohort 2 will be achieved using a single 
bottle type approach.  If 15 0mg is selected as the dose for Cohort 2, there will be no titration 
period.  Participant s will take one capsule daily  for the duration of the study. Study drug will be 
supplied in participant -specific kits that each contain s two (2) bottles.   Each two (2) bottle kit is 
intended to support six months of dosing.  Participant s will be dispensed one (1) bottle at the

will not be allowed to continue in the study and a premature withdrawal visit should be conducted.  
The participant will be required to return to the study site for the 30 and 60 day safety follow -up 
visits (for Cohort 1 = Visit 05 and Visit 06; for Cohort 2 =  Visit 07 and Visit 08).  
 
 
7.10.2. RULES FOR DO SE SUSPENSION AND RE - CHALLENGE FOR SAFETY REASONS   
Dosage suspension for safety reasons can occur at any time during the study.   Re-challenge will 
be allowed when abnormalities have resolved fully.   Please, r efer to the Table 2 (above)  
 
See instructions for dose re challenges if dose reduction / suspension were triggered by [CONTACT_825699] 
(Table 2 above).

documented on the Dose Management Log.  
 
For drug suspensions lasting more than 7 days, participants  need  to be re -titrated : 
 
Cohort 1 :  Participant s will take one capsule once daily (150mg or matching placebo - Bottle A) 
and increas e to 2 capsules once daily  (one capsule from Bottle A and one capsule from Bottle B) 
in 7 days.  
 
Cohort 2 :  If dose will be 150mg: Participant s will resume  one capsule once daily dose (either 
150mg or matching placebo).    
If dose will be 300mg:  Participant s will take one capsule once daily (150mg or matching placebo) 
and increas e the dose to 2 capsules  once daily  in 7 days.  
 
Participants will not be allowed to remain in the study if study drug is permanently discontinued.   
Once the decision to permanently discontinue study drug is made, a premature withdrawal visit 
should be conducted.  The participant will be encouraged  return to the study site for the 30 and

Any change in the dosage of t hese medications will require C TCC notification.   
 
It is anticipated  that around 50% of participant s recruited in Cohort [ADDRESS_1144978] prior to 
Visit 3 (3 months).  Subsequent to Visit 3, ST may be initiated  at any time at the discretion  of the 
Site Investigator  and /or treating  physician.  The Site Investigator  will document  any new 
medications  or changes  in medication  at each study  visit in the source documents and on the 
Concomitant  Medication  Log in the eCRF.  
Time to initiati on of ST (for Cohort 2 ) or change in th e dose of ST for Cohort [ADDRESS_1144979] dose will be calculated in levodopa dose equivalence  (LDE)40.   
A stable regimen of central nervous system acting medications (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], antidepressants, 
hypnotics) is allowed. The dosage needs  to be stable fo r 30 days prior to the baseline visit. The 
dosage can be adjusted during the study at the discretion of the Site Investigator .  Central nervous 
system acting medications can be initiated during the study, if needed, at the discretion of the Site 
Investigat or.

8.2 CAUTIONARY AND EXCLUSIONARY MEDICATIONS WITH NIL OTINIB  
The general categories of exclusionary medications include: QT prolonging drugs, strong 
CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1144980](s) are 
made.  
 
Drugs that May Prolong the QT Interval  
Nilotinib may prolong  the QT interval. The administration of nilotinib with agents that prolong 
the QT interval such as anti -arrhythmic medicines should be avoided.   See Appendix  [ADDRESS_1144981] 
of drugs that can prolong the QT interval  (see also the precautionary list of drugs with pos sible 
or conditional risk of Torsades de Pointes - Appendix 2). 
 
Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers  
See Appendix [ADDRESS_1144982] of exclusionary medications : Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors  
 
Nilotinib is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and partiall y by [CONTACT_097]2C8.  Therefore, 
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited to avoid undesirable increases in 
exposure to nilotinib.  For example, in a drug -drug interaction study of healthy individuals 
receiving the CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole ( 400mg once daily), the systemic exposure of 
nilotinib was increased ~ [ADDRESS_1144983] reported increases in nilotinib Cmax and AUC by 60% and 29%, 
respectively (Yin et al. 201045).   
 
Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP3A4 will also not be allowed, to avoid reducing 
nilotinib exposures to a clinically relevant extent . In a drug -drug interaction study of rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
a potent CYP3A4 inducer, nilotinib AUC decreased by [CONTACT_140992] y 80%.  Should tr eatment 
with any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers  be required, therapy with nilotinib should be 
interrupted.  
 
Nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and UGT1A1 in vitro, 
potentially increasing the concentrations  of drugs eliminated by [CONTACT_36918].  In vitro studies 
also suggest that nilotinib may induce CYP2B6, 2C8, and 2C9, and decrease the concentration 
of drugs which are eliminated by [CONTACT_36918].  In human studies, n ilotinib is considered a 
moderate  inhib itor of  CYP3A4.  It has been shown to increase the systemic exposure of oral 
midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) 2.6 -fold.  As a result, the systemic exposure of drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (e.g., certain HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors) may be increased when 
co-administered with nilotinib. Dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that are CYP3A4 
substrates, especially those that have narrow therapeutic indices when co -administered with 
nilotinib. Therefore, appropriate monitoring is needed for potential adverse effects related to

Page 108 of 198 
Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  concomitant medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 and the other CYP enzymes mentioned 
above with the initiation of nilotinib.  Also, precaution with the initiation of a new medication 
during the course of study should be taken if tha t agent is a substrate of any of the CYP 
enzymes mentioned above.    
 
Nilotinib inhibits the human drug efflux transporter, P -glycoprotein (P -gp).  If nilotinib is 
administered with drugs that are substrates of P -gp, increased concentrations of the substrat e 
drug are likely, and cautions should be exercised. Nilotinib is also a substrate of P -gp, and if it 
is administered with drugs that inhibit P -gp, increased concentrations of nilotinib are likely.  
Thus, caution should be exercised with concomitant use of  P-gp inhibitors.   
 
See Appendix [ADDRESS_1144984] of exclusionary medications : Strong CYP3A4 Inducers.  
 
Drugs that Affect Gastric pH  
 
See Appendix [ADDRESS_1144985] of exclusionary medications : Proton Pump Inhibitors.  
 
Nilotinib has pH -dependent solubility, with d ecreased solubility at higher pH. Drugs such as 
proton pump inhibitors that inhibit gastric acid secretion to elevate the gastric pH may decrease 
the solubility of nilotinib and reduce its bioavailability. In healthy participant s, coadministration 
of a sin gle 400mg dose of nilotinib with multiple doses of esomeprazole (a proton pump 
inhibitor) at 40mg daily decreased the nilotinib AUC by 34%. Increasing the dose of nilotinib 
when coadministered with such agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of ex posure. 
Since proton pump inhibitors affect pH of the upper GI tract for an extended period, separation 
of doses may not eliminate the interaction. The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors with 
nilotinib is not recommended.  
 
Antacid that contains alum inum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or simethicone are allowed . 
These medicines should be taken about 2 hours before or about 2 hours after they take study drug.  
 
 In healthy participant s, no significant change in nilotinib PK was observed when a single 
400mg dose of nilotinib was administered 10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine (an H2 
blocker). Therefore, when the concurrent use of a n H2 blocker is necessary, it may be 
administered approximately 10 hours before and approximately 2  hours after th e dose of 
nilotinib. Administration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium 
hydroxide/simethicone) to healthy participant s, 2 hours before or 2 hours after a single 400mg 
dose of nilotinib did not alter nilotinib PK. Therefore, if necessary, an antacid  may be 
administered approximately 2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of nilotinib.

The timing of assessments described below will be per the protocol Schedule of Activities.  
 
9.1 PRIMARY VARIABLES  
Tolerability : will be defined based on ability to complete the study on the assigned dose. 
Tolerability will be judged by [CONTACT_825659] s enrolled in a dosage group able to 
complete the study on their originally assigned dosage. Tolerability of each activ e arm will be 
compared to group.  
 
Safety : Safety will be primarily assessed based on a direct comparison of treatment -related 
serious adverse events across the two treatment groups.  Additional safety assessments will 
involve further comparisons of adverse  events, overall serious adverse events, and safety 
laboratory findings across the two groups. Summary tables will be tabulated and provided for 
review to the Independent Medical Monitor (IMM) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
on an agreed upon time frequency.).  
 
Efficacy : will be assessed  by [CONTACT_825700] -UPDRS Part III over time. All participants 
in cohort [ADDRESS_1144986] an assessment of the 
motor exam (Part III) in a practically defined OFF sta te (approximately [ADDRESS_1144987] ) and ON state  (based on the participant/ Site Investigator  defined BEST ON,

Medical history  (by [CONTACT_825701] -status) and detailed PD diagnosis and history 
will be obtained prior to randomization. Clinical evaluations at each subsequent in -person 
visit after randomization will review any changes  over baseline and will involve clinical 
assessments including vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature), 
weight, electrocardiogram, laboratory abnormalities, and adverse events.  
 
 
9.3.3 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  
Physical examinati ons during the study will include assessment of skin, head, neck, 
lymphatic, eyes, ears, nose and throat, abdomen, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular/peripheral 
vascular and musculoskeletal systems.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_1144990] open and directed 
questioning to the participant  followed by [CONTACT_5292].  
 
9.3.5 VITAL SIGNS, WEIGHT,  HEIGHT  
Vital signs w ill be assessed at every visit and will include blood pressure, pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7146].  Blood pressure (BP)  and pulse rate should be taken after 
participant  has been seated for 1 -3 minutes.  Orthostatic vital signs are serial meas ureme nts 
of blood pressure  and pulse that will be taken  in supi[INVESTIGATOR_825605] 
2 minutes .  At Screening, if BP is “uncontrolled” ( Systolic Blood pressure ( SBP) greater 
than 180mmHg or Diastolic Blood Pressure ( DBP ) greater than 98mmHg) o n the first 
reading, this can be repeated up to 2 more times to obtain a reading that is “controlled”. If 
the first reading is “controlled” (SBP less than 180mmHg or DBP less than 98mmHg) then 
no need for further measurements.  Measurement of height will b e taken at Screening only 
and weight will be measured at all visits.  
     
9.3.6 CLINICAL LABORATORY TESTS

 All participant s will have safety labor atory tests at the designated visits outlined in the 
protocol. These samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  All samples for 
laboratory analysis must be collected, prepared, labeled, and shipped according to the 
laboratory’s requirements. There will be provisions for reflex testing in the event of 
an abnormal result requiring immediate retesting.  
 Coagulation Parameters - will be collected prior to performing Lumbar puncture. 
Results of the coagulation  parameters should be available to the site Inv estigator prior

exam has to be documented. In case  the clinician fails to perform routine LP, LP procedure 
can be scheduled under fluoroscopy – once that has been approved by [CONTACT_941] C TCC. 
The first 1-2 mL of CSF will be discarded;  the subsequent  2-4 mL will be processed at  the 
site’s  local laboratory  facility  (unless  the laboratory  is not able to process  the CSF within  
4 hours)  to conduct  standard  analyses  on cell count,  including  red blood  cell counts.  The 
remaining  CSF will be processed  and shipped  to a central  laboratory  for biomarker  and 
PK assessments (PK only at visit 3).  Please  refer to the laboratory  manual  provided  by [CONTACT_51239].  
The CSF samples will be sent to a central repository to be stored indefinitely for research 
purposes. The CSF samples will be made available  to researchers to conduct analyses related 
to PD and other disorders.  
Participant s will be closely  monitored  during  the procedure  and following  the procedure.   
Further  details  can be found  in the Operations  Manual  for this study.  
 
9.3.9   ELECTROCARDIOGRA M (ECG)  
     
Electrocardiogram (ECG) (12 -lead) will be performed at designated visits  per the Schedule 
of Activities  and tra nsmitted electronically to the c entral ECG laboratory which will 
determine the RR, PR, QRS and QTc (QTc F) intervals and provide a r eport back to the site. 
The ECGs will be recorded after the participant  has been in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_1144995](s). The ECG report must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_825704].  
     
10. CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS   
 
10.1.  MOVEMENT DISORDERS S OCIETY UNIFIED PD RA TING SCALE (MDS -UPDR S) 
The MDS -UPDRS will be conducted per the Schedule of Activities . The MDS -UPDRS was 
designed by [CONTACT_292789] (e.g., 
by [CONTACT_292790]) while preserving its overall format. The 
MDS -UPDRS has four part s:  
 Part I (non -motor experiences of daily living) , comprising  
 Part IA concerning behaviors that are assessed by [CONTACT_825705]  
 Part IB that is completed by [CONTACT_292792], but 
independently of the Site Investigator.

Page 113 of 198 
Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018   Part II (motor experiences of daily living) , designed to be a self -administered questionnaire 
like Part IB, but similarly can be reviewed by [CONTACT_825706].  
 
 Part III (motor examination) has instructions for the rater to give or demonstrate to the 
patient; it is completed by [CONTACT_292794].  Once the participant  initiates ST MDS -
UPDRS part III will be collected in the defined medications OFF ( approximately [ADDRESS_1144996] ) state at designated visits and cohorts and both OFF and ON ( based 
on the participant/ Site Investigator  defined BEST ON and/or approximately [ADDRESS_1144997]) states  for designated visit and cohorts per the schedule of activities . 
 Part IV (motor complications)  with instru ctions for the rater and also instructions to be read 
to the patient. This part integrates patient -derived information with the rater's clinical 
observations and judgments and is complete d by [CONTACT_29975]. Complete Part IV only if ST has 
been initiated .  
  
Participant s will self -administer Parts IB and II, but will review responses for accuracy and 
clarity with the Site Investigator or Coordinator.  Parts IA, III and IV must be conducted by 
[CONTACT_67505].  Parts I, II, and III will be conducted at study visits as indicated on the 
Schedule of Activities. For participants who have started ST , Part IV will be conducted at 
visits where MDS -UPDRS Parts I -III are conducted/collected.  Use of  MDS -UPDRS is 
responsive to core instrument recommendations for the Quality of  Life subdomain of the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Element s 
(CDEs)  for PD, and to FDA guidance encouraging use of patient -reported  outcomes (PROs) 
as a substantial portion of the responses are patient -reported.  Ideally,  the same Site 
Investigator should assess all participant s on parts IA and III of the MDS -UPDRS at all 
study visits.  
 
10.2   MODIFIED SCHWAB & EN GLAND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING    SCALE  
 
The Modified Schwab & England scale is a Site Investigator and participant  assessment of 
the participant ’s level of independence. The participant  will be scored on a percentage scale 
reflective of his/her ability to perform acts of da ily living. Printed scores with associated 
descriptors range from 100% to 0% in increments of 10%, where 100% is “ participant  has 
full ability and is completely independent; essentially normal” and 0% is “vegetative 
functions such as swallowing, bladder an d bowel functions are not functioning; bedridden”. 
Scores should be coded in increments of 5, (i.e. 095, 090, 085).  This assessment will be 
completed jointly by  [CONTACT_825707] .

Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  10.3   PARKINSON’S DISE ASE QUESTIONNAIRE - 39 ITEM VE RSION (PDQ -39) SCALE  
The PDQ -39 is a disease -specific quality of life questionnaire containing  39 questions 
organized over eight domains: mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), 
emotional well -being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social su pport (3 items), cognition (4 items), 
communication (3 items), and bodily discomfort (3 items). The PDQ -[ADDRESS_1144998] generally good 
psychometric properties and content validity. U se of PDQ -39 is responsive to core instrument 
recommendations for the Quality of Life subdomain of the NINDS CDEs for PD, and to FDA 
guidance encouraging use of patient reported outcomes ( PROs ). This assessment will be 
collected from participant s. 
 
10.4 HOEHN AND YAHR SCALE  
The Hoehn and Yahr is a commonly used scale  for describing how the symptoms of PD 
progress. The scale allocates stages from 0 to 5 to indicate the relative level of disability.  This 
scale is included within the MDS -UPDRS and will be com pleted for all subjects.  
 
 Stage zero: No symptoms.  
 Stage one: Symptoms on one side of the body only.  
 Stage two: Symptoms on both sides of the body. No impairment of balance.  
 Stage three: Balance impairment. Mild to moderate disease. Physically 
independent.  
 Stage four: Severe disability, but still able to walk or stand unassisted.  
 Stage five: Wheelchair -bound or bedridden unless assisted.  
 
10.5  MONTREAL COGNITIVE A SSESSMENT (MOCA)  
In early PD, when cognitive deficits occur, they are subtle and mild and the participant s 
usually perform in the normal range of the widely used Mini -Mental State Exam  (MMSE) . 
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a rapid screening instrument like the MMSE, but was 
developed to be more sensitive to patients presenting with mild cogn itive complaints. It is 
designated an NINDS CDE for PD. Compared to the MMSE the MoCA may be more 
sensitive to mild cognitive deficits in PD.188 The MoCA assesses short term and working 
memory, visual -spatial abilities, executive function, attention, conce ntration, language and 
orientation.  The total score ranges from 0 to 30 (highest function).   
 
10.6 PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS AS SESSMENT  
The Primary Diagnosis form captures, in the Site Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a current percentile 
probability the participant  has idiopathic Parkinson disease as well as meets current diagnostic 
criteria for the study based on available information. Ranges include: 90 -100%; 50 -89%, 10 -
49% and 0 -9%. In addition , the Site Investigator selects the most likely primary diagnosis

10.8    BECK DEPRESSION INVE NTORY -II (BDI -II) 
The Beck Depression Inventory -II (BDI -II). The BDI -II is a [ADDRESS_1145000] week.  Total scores  range from 0 to 63; higher scores indicate 
higher severity.  
   
10.9  PARKINSON’S DISEASE SLEEP SCALE  (PDSS)  
The change in sleep function will be assessed via the Parkinson’s disease sleep scale (PDSS).  
The PDSS consists of 15 questions that the person wi th Parkinson’s rates by [CONTACT_825708] 
a line that represents a continuum from worst (0) to best (10). The clinician or scorer then 
measures the marks and assigns values to them. The PDSS asks about movement during the 
night, awkward positions or difficulty  in changing positions, nocturia, nightmares, and other 
factors that interrupt sleep. The PDSS is primarily useful for physicians in trying to assess 
the need for nighttime anti -parkinson’s medications.  
 
10.10 EUROPEAN QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE (EQ -5D) 
The EQ -5D is a measure of self -reported health outcomes that is applicable to a wide range 
of health conditions and treatments. It consists of two parts: a descriptive system (Part I) and 
a visual  analogue scale  (Part II). Part I of the scale consists of 5 singl e-item dimensions 
including: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension has a 3-point  response scale designed to indicate the level of the problem. Part II 
uses a vertical graduated VAS (thermometer) to  measure health status, ranging from worst

includes a valuation task which is used only for valuation studies. There is  also an optional 
set of demographic questions ( EuroQol Group; McDowell & Newell, 1996; Bowling,  2005).

Participant s’ responses will not be available to the Site Investigator  or Coordinator when they 
make their assessments.  
10.12 C-SSRS (BASELINE AND SINCE LAST VISIT ) 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is an FDA endorsed questionnaire to 
screen for suicidality in trials of central nervous system (CNS) active compounds.42,43   The C -
SSRS is an interview by [CONTACT_825709]. The form  called “Baseline”  provided at 
Screening collects the history of suicide and  a form called “ Since the Last Visit” collects data 
at subsequent visits . 
 
10.13 MATTIS DEMENTIA RATI NG SCALE (DRS -2)  
The Mattis dementia rating scale is a psychometric Instrument designed to assess the extent 
and nature of dementia. The scale consists of content that covers: attention, 
initiation/perseveration, construction, conceptualization, and memory (Monsch et al., 1995). 
The scale has been used extensively in studies assessing cognitive function pertaining to 
neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s dise ase (Monsch et al., 1995) and PD (Brown 
et al., 1999). The DRS  -[ADDRESS_1145001] dementia in PD (Llebaria, Mov dis  
2008).   DRS -2 alternate forms  will be used at V03 and PW (as applicable) during cohort [ADDRESS_1145002] and PW (as applicable) to avoid practice bias.   
 
10.14 CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPR ESSION SCALE  
The CGI is a 3-item observer -rated  scale  that measures  illness  severity  (CGIS), global  
improvement  or change  (CGIC),  and therapeutic  response . Each  component  of the CGI is 
rated  separately;  the instrument  does not yield  a global  score.   
 
The CGIS  is rated  on a 7-point  scale,  with the severity  of illness  scale  using  a range  of 
responses  from  1 (normal)  through to 7 (amongst  the most  severely  ill patients).  CGIC  
scores  range  from 1 (very  much  improved)  through  to 7 (very  much  worse).  Treatment  
response  ratings  should  take account  of both therapeutic  efficacy  and treatment -related  AEs 
and range  from  0 (marked  improvement  and no side-effects),  and 4 (unchanged  or worse  
and side-effects  outweigh  the therapeutic  effects).  
 
10.15  PD – STUDY TREATMENT EXPECTANCY QUESTIONN AIRE  
A self -administered questionnaire assessing expectations of study drug effect will be colle cted at 
the selected visits as specified in the SOA

10.16 ADDITIONAL ASSESSMEN TS  
 
 10.16.1 ASSESSMENT  OF PARTICIPANT  COMPLIANCE   
At each study visit, the Site Investigator  and/or Study Coordinator will assess the participant ’s 
compliance with the study requirements. This will include checks of protocol compliance, 
including use of study drug  and concomitant medications,  if applicable in order to assess the 
reliability of participant -generated data. (If applicable, note that participant s who fail to 
compl y with the study requirements may be withdrawn from the study.)  
 
10.16.2 ASSESS NEED FOR SYMPTOMATIC THERAPY  (COHORT 2)  
Beginning at Visit 3, the Site Investigator  will assess the participant ’s need for ST. A 
questionnaire will be used to facilitate the Site Investigator ’s decision.  This decision will be 
based on PD disability posing a threat to the participant ’s current occupational status, current 
abilities (potential capacities) related to occupational matters, to handle routine personal 
finances and do mestic responsibilities, and activities of daily living.    
 
10.16.3 PHARMACOKINETIC  ASSESSMENTS  
PK samples will be collected to determine the serum  PK  of nilotinib in patients with PD. 
PK analysis will use serum  and CSF sample from Visit 3.  
 To investigat e the ability of nilotinib to cross the blood brain barrier in PD patients at a 
dose(s) that is tolerable and safe as measured by [CONTACT_2715] -dependent increases in unbound 
nilotinib levels in the CSF  
 To investigate the relationship between nilotinib exposures in  serum  and CSF with its 
ability to engage known molecular target(s) (measured by [CONTACT_825671] (e.g., reduction in phosphor -cAbl)).  
 To investigate factors that could affect the  PK of nilotinib such as age, sex, PD s everity, 
race/ethnicity.  
 
Serum and CSF PK samples will be collected at the specified visits as outlined in the Schedule 
of activities and summarized below  
 Cohort 1  
 Serum PK samples will be collected  
 Visit 1 (Day 14):  Collection of a pre-dose trough  samp le (24 + [ADDRESS_1145003] dose).

Blood, s erum , plasma and spi[INVESTIGATOR_825610] a imed to explore the  ability of 
nilotinib to engage its known  and exploratory molecular  target(s) by [CONTACT_825671]. In addition,  Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) 
will be collected. . In addition , the biomarkers panel will explore impact of nilotinib on 
dopaminergic syst em as measured by [CONTACT_825710] o ther biomarkers linked to potential mechanism of neuroprotection 
(including but not limited to  CSF alpha -synuc lein, total tau, phospho -tau, etc.). Please, refer 
to the biomarkers analysis plan for the specific  details  on the data collection and to the labs 
operational manual for the instructions for the samples collection .  
 
The samples will be collected, at the visits indicated :   
 Blood for DNA  [collected at BL]  
 Blood  for  biomarkers  [see SOA for the schedule of samples collection ]  
 
*If the participant  permanently discontinues study drug for any reason, before the final visit, 
the blood sample should be taken at an unscheduled study visit on the day participant  plans 
to discontinue the study drug  as outlined in the SOA for the Premature Withdrawal visit 
(Section 6.10- Cohort 1; Section 6.23- Cohort 2 ).  
 
DNA Sample Collection  
A blood sample will be collected from each participant  at the Baseline  visit. These samples 
will be used to extract DNA for storage and shared for future unspecified research.  
Participants  will be given the option of refusing to have this sample collected or may request 
that their sample be destroyed at any time, without affecting their participat ion in the study. 
One of the rationales for the DNA sample collection is to assess if there is correlation of 
response to nilotinib with a particular genetic profile.   
 
     
11. INTERCURRENT ILLNESS  
     
In the event of an intercurrent illness, it is at t he Site Investigator ’s discretion to determine if 
the participant  may continue in the study with study drug treatment. The clinical course of the 
intercurrent illness will be followed to its appropriate conclusion and full notation made in 
the appropriate source documentation.  All intercurrent illnesses must be recorded in the eCRF 
as adverse events.

Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  12.  PREMATURE WITHDRAWALS/DROPOUTS  
 
Participant s will be advised in the written informed consent forms that they have the right to 
withdraw from the study a t any time without prejudice, and may be withdrawn at  the Site 
Investigator ’s/Principal Investigator’s discretion at any time.   Reason for withdrawal from study 
will be documented in the source documents and captured in the eCRF as appropriate.  
 
If a participant  who has started study drug terminates the study prematurely, every effort should 
be made to obtain final laboratory tests and evaluations of clinical status, especially those 
pertaining to the study’s primary outcome measure.  Reasonable effort sho uld be made to contact 
[CONTACT_825711], drugs or clinical supplies.  Following unsuccessful 
telephone contact, an effort to co ntact the participant  by [CONTACT_107601] a method that provides proof 
of receipt should be attempted.  A Participant  may be deemed lost to follow up if all efforts have 
failed after one month. Such efforts should be documented in the source documents. Participa nts 
withdrawn from the study will not be replaced . Such efforts should be documented in the source 
documents.  
 
A Participant  may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
 
 Adverse Event  
 Refer to Section 14 
 
 Administrative  
 Withdraw al of consent  
 Request of  Study Sponsor  or Steering Committee (SC)  
 Request of primary care physician  
 Participant  non-compliance with protocol  
 Failure to meet entry criteria  
 Pregnancy  
 Protocol deviation  
 Participant  deemed lost to follow up/failure to return  
 Early termination of study  
 Other  
 
All patients  who prematurely  and permanently  discontinue  study  medication  prior  to (Visit  
04) in Cohort 1,  or (Visit  06) in Cohort [ADDRESS_1145017] Drug Evaluation Visits  V05/V06 for Cohort 1 and V 07/V08 for Cohort 2 , if possible.  
 
Participant  early discontinuation of study drug and premature withdrawal (including 
participant s who are lost to follow up) should be reported to the CTCC Project Manager within 
24 hours of the sit e’s knowledge of the event.

The Screening/Demographic form must be completed for all study participant s who sign informed 
consent. This includes participant s who completed the study or withdrew/were withdrawn from 
study treatment or were screened and sign ed a consent form but did not start treatment.   
 
The End of Study/Conclusion of Study Participation form should be completed for all participant s 
who have been randomized. If a participant  withdraws due to an adverse event, the site must 
ensure that the e vent is captured on the eCRF Adverse Event form.  
 
 
List of criteria  for permanent  treatment discontinuation  
 
The following  may be justifiable  reasons  for the Site Investigator  to discontinue  a participant 
from  treatment.  
Participant  specific  criteria : 
• Participant  experiences  two similar  SAE s or one life-threatening  SAE  
(assessed  as related  by [CONTACT_825712]/or site 
investigator ) 
• Participant  becomes  pregnant  
 
Trial  specific  criteria:  
• Any AEs,  per Site Investigator  judgment,  that may jeopardize  the 
participant 's safety  
• Participant develops any ECG, laboratory or clinical events as outlined in 
Table 2, Section 7.9.2  
• Any unblinding  of the study  treatment  by [CONTACT_67505]  
• Any use of prohibited  concomitant  treatment  (see Appendix 2 ) 
• At participant ’s request,  i.e., withdrawal  of the consent  for treatment  
 
 
Any abnormal  laboratory  or ECG value  will be rechecked  by [CONTACT_825713],  respectively,  for confirmation  before  making  a decision  of permanent  
discontinua tion of the study drug  for the concerned  participant . 
 
If a participant  decides  to discontinue  participation  in the study,  he/she  should  be contact[CONTACT_825714](s)  for discontinuation  and 
collec tion of any potential  AEs.

If possible,  and after the permanent  discontinuation  of study drug treatment,  the participant  
will be assessed  using  the Premature Withdrawal Visit .  
All cases  of permanent  treatment  discontinuation  should  be recorded  by [CONTACT_825715].  
Participants who permanently discontinue treatment will be withdrawn from the study.  Please 
refer to section 6.10 (cohort 1) and section 6.23 (cohort 2)  for specific instructions for 
premature withdrawal.   
Circumstances for permanent discontinuation and premature withdrawal must be clearly 
documented in source documents.  
 
 
13. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
 Refer to the Safety M anagement  Plan for a detailed descriptio n of adverse events 
assessment .  
    
13.1 ADVERSE EVENT (AE) D EFINITION      
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
An adverse event can be any unfavorable and un intended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply 
any judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -
label use, use in combin ation with another drug) and with any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
 
Some examples of adverse events are:  
 
 A change, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a 
pre-existing con dition.  
 A deterioration in the participant ’s condition due to the participant ’s primary disease or a 
pre-existing condition.  
 Development of an intercurrent illness during the study.  
 Development of symptoms which may or may not be related to the use of a co ncomitant 
medication or study drug.  
 Appearance of abnormal laboratory results or significant shifts from baseline, but still within 
the reference ranges, which the Investigator considers clinically important.

Date: [ADDRESS_1145018] include start and stop dates (when available), intensity, 
causality and outcome, as well as any actions taken.  
 
13.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EV ENTS (SAE)    
An SAE is an AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring at any dose of the investigational 
product (including placebo) and is considered  “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or IMM , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Report if you suspect th at the death was an outcome of the adverse event, and include the 
date if known;  
 Life-threatening adverse event  
 Report if suspected that the patient was at substantial risk of dying at the time of 
the adverse event, or use or continued use of the device or  other medical product 
might have resulted in the death of the patient.  
 This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death;  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged)  
 Report if admission to the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274358] a 
result of the adverse event.  
 Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355103] (e.g., life -threatening; required 
intervention t o prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious 
medically important event).  
 This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272]:  
• Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition which has not 
worsened since signing the informed consent  
• Social r easons and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_825611] ’s general condition.   
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious.  
 Disability or Permanent Damage  
 Report if the adverse event resulted in a substantial disruption of a person's 
ability to conduct normal life functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a 
significant, persistent or permanent change, impairmen t, damage or disruption 
in the patient's body function/structure, physical activities and/or quality of 
life; 
 Congenital Anomaly Birth Defect  
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled,  Phase IIa, Parallel Group, Two -

Activity of the Chronic Administration of Nilotinib in Participant s with Parkinson’s 
Disease ( PD) 
 
 
Page 124 of 198 
Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018   Report if you suspect that exposure to a medical product prior to conception 
or during pregnancy may have resulted  in an adverse outcome in the child.  
 Other Serious (Important Medical Events)  
 Report when the event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may 
jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
(treatment) to prevent one of  the other outcomes. Examples include allergic 
bronchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) requiring treatment in an 
emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders) or 
seizures/convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The developme nt of 
drug dependence or drug abuse would also be examples of important medical 
events.  
 This category also includes any event the Site Investigator  or the Clinical 
Monitor judges to be serious or which would suggest a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect or precaution. It can also involve the withdrawal 
of a participant  from a study due to abnormal lab values, excluding screening 
labs. 
 
Reports of serious adverse events, as defined above, require immediate notification (within 24 
hours of the s ite’s awareness) to the CTCC  Project Manager or Clinical Monitor whether or not 
the Investigator believes that the experience is related to study drug or expected.   
 
[COMPANY_001] Drug Safety & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_825612] r.  
Reporting will occur according to the Safety Management Plan.  
   
 13.3 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
1. Adverse events that present after a participant signs the informed consent but prior to the 
initiation of study drug are considered non -treatment emerg ent adverse events and will be coded 
separately.  
2. Treatment Emergent AES (TEAE) : Adverse events that present, or worsen in intensity or 
frequency, following the first dose of study drug will be categorized as treatment emergent 
adverse events.  
 13.[ADDRESS_1145019] ING OF ADVERSE EVENT S  
At each visit , the site study staff will assess adverse events by [CONTACT_825716]. At each study visit, the 
occurrence of  AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -leading questioning of the participant and caregiver 
during the study and may also be identified when the participant and/or caregiver spontaneously 
volunteered them. Open -ended, non -leading questioning of the participant is th e preferred 
method to detect AEs.

Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  Suitable non -leading questions include:   
“How are you feeling?”  
“How have you been doing since your last evaluation?”  
“Have you taken any new medicines since your last evaluation? If so, why?”  
 
Collection of AEs will b egin immediately following signing of the ICF through the final study 
visit. All AEs will be recorded into the adverse events eCRF in EDC within 5 business days. A Es 
should be recorded by [CONTACT_637] (if known) rather than individual signs and symptoms. Each  
individual event should be recorded in the eCRF.  The Site Investigator will monitor each 
participant closely and record all observed or volunteered AEs. Adverse findings detected at the 
Screening visit (e.g., abnormalities on clinical laboratory testing,  ECGs, physical/neuro 
examination) will be recorded as Medical History and adverse events occurring after the 
Screening visit but before starting study treatment will be recorded on the AE log and considered 
non-treatment emergent .  Participants will be co ntacted by [CONTACT_825717].  
 
AEs will be followed:  
 until resolution;   
 stabilization;  
 for 30 days after the participant’s last dose of study drug;  
Whichever occurs first.      
    
13.5  ADVERSE EVENT CA[LOCATION_003] LITY DEFINITIONS  
For each adverse event, the causality (i.e., their relationship to the study treatment) must be 
assessed by [CONTACT_825718]. Ambiguous cases should be considered as having a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship unless further evidence becomes available to refute this.  
    
TERM  DEFINITION  CLARIFICATION  
Unrelated  No possible 
relationship  The temporal relationship between drug 
exposure and t he adverse event onset/course is 
unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal 
relationship to study drug is implausible.  
Unlikely  Not reasonably related, 
although a causal 
relationship cannot be 
ruled out  While the temporal relationship between drug 
exposure  and the adverse event onset/course does 
not preclude causality, there is a clear alternate 
cause that is more likely to have caused the 
adverse event than the study drug.

Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE), v. 4.03.  
 
 
13.6  ADVERSE EVENT SEVERI TY DEFINITIONS      
The Site Investigator  will make  an assessment  of severity  (intensity)  for each AE reported  
during  the study.  The assessment  will be based  on the Site Investigator’s  clinical judgemen t. 
The intensity of each AE recorded in the CRF should be assigned to  one of the following  
categories:  
 
 Mild : An event that causes no limitations of usual  activities  
 Moderate : An event that causes some limitation of usual  activities  
 Severe : An event that p revents carrying out usual  activities  
    
 
13.7   REPORTING SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENTS   
 Collection of SAEs will begin immediately following signing of the ICF through the final 
study visit.  The Site Investigator will monitor each participant closely and recor d all 
observed or volunteered SAEs.  Serious a dverse events occurring after signing the 
informed consent form but before starting study treatment will be considered non -treatment 
emergent. The Site Investigator should record all serious adverse events that  occur during 
the study period on the Adverse Event Log and in the appropriate source documents.

A brief description of the statistical analysis plan is provided below.  More details will be 
included in a formal statistical analysis plan, which will be developed by [INVESTIGATOR_214729] T rials 
Statistical Management Center  at the University of Iowa in collaboration with the protocol PI, 
CTCC  and NILO -PD Steering Committee  (SC) 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, we will not attempt to make any type of adjustment 
for multiple compa risons.  Correspondingly, unless specified differently, all hypotheses will be 
assessed at that 0.05 significance level.  
 
14.1 GENERAL DESIGN ISSU ES 
14.1.1 SUMMARY OF STUDY DE SIGN – COHORT [ADDRESS_1145024] the α -synuclein pathology observed 
in PD1-3,7,31,36.  A small clinical study that lacked a placebo control group and blinding te sted the 
safety/tolerability of nilotinib in PD patients for the first time, and also explored its efficacy9  
Although the preliminary data appear promising, the study design used in these prior studies 
precludes making firm conclusions about safety, tolerability, optimal dose, or efficacy10. Hence, 
an opportunity exists to rigorously establish the safety, tolerability, and optimal dose of nilotinib 
to enable and inform the conduct of future definitive efficacy studies in PD participant s.   
To address these issues, we will conduct a multi -center, prospective, randomized, controlled, 
double -blinded phase IIa study intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary 
efficacy of nilotinib in participant s with moderate to advanced PD.  The first stage of the study 
will enroll approxim ately 75 participant s, randomized in a 1:1:1 manner to receive a once daily 
dose of either nilotinib (150mg), nilotinib (300mg), or placebo.  All Participant s will be treated 
for [ADDRESS_1145025] stage, we will make one of three decisions:  
 If the 300mg dose is tolerable, and has an acceptable safety profile, this dose will be 
chosen for inclusion in the second cohort.  
 If the 300mg dose is not tolerable, or if the 300mg dose is tolerable but has an 
unacceptable safety profile, then we will consider the 150mg dose.  If the 150mg dose is

the second cohort.  
 If neither dose is tolerable, or if all tolerable doses have unacceptable safety profiles, we 
will conclude that no dose appears suitably safe and tolerable for inclusion in the second 
cohort.  Under this scenario, the trial should be stopped without proceeding to a second 
cohort.  
A key secondary objective of the first cohort will be to conduct a single group futility 
hypothesis in each PD group comparing the observed chang e in MDS -UPDRS part III between 
baseline and month [ADDRESS_1145026] of nilotinib as measured by [CONTACT_825651] -
UPDRS part III shortly afte r initiation of study  drug (between baseline and 1 month), and after  
discontinuation of study drug [between month 6 (end of treatment)and month 7 (1 month after 
treatment)].  For all participant s, assessment of the potential symptomatic effect will be don e 
using the MDS -UPDRS part III collected in the ON ( based on the participant/site investigator 
defined best ON and/or approximately [ADDRESS_1145027] ) state.  
 
14.1.2 SUMMARY OF STUDY DES IGN – COHORT 2  
The second cohort will involve a multi -center, pr ospective, randomized, controlled, double -
blind phase IIa study intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of 
nilotinib in participant s with early/ de novo PD.  Based on the algorithm described in section 
14.1.[ADDRESS_1145028] tolerated and safe from cohort 1 will be selected  for inclusion in 
cohort 2.  The second stage of the study will enroll approximately 60 participant s, randomized 
in a 2:1 manner to receive a once daily dose of either nilotinib (at the dose chosen from  the 
findings in cohort 1) or placebo.  All participant s will be treated for [ADDRESS_1145029] of nilotinib as 
measured by [CONTACT_825651] -UPDRS part III shortly after initiation of study drug (between 
baseline and 1 month), and after  discontinuation of study drug (between month 12 (end of 
treatment)  and month 13 (1 month after treatment).  For the participant s treated with ST, 
assessment of the potential symptomatic effect will be done in the PD medications ON ( based 
on the participant/site investigator defined best ON and/or approximately [ADDRESS_1145030]) state.

Date: 21 Feb 2018  14.1.3 RANDOMIZATION  
Refer to Section 7.6 for details.  
 
The randomization process will be similar for both Cohort 1 and 2.  Participants will be assigned 
a Participant ID number at the time they sign/date the informed consent form.   The treatment for 
each participant will be assigned by a randomized code. A blocked randomization scheme will 
be used to ensure approximately even distribution of participants in treatment groups.  As the 
participant qualifies for the randomized phase of the study, the Site Investigator  or Study 
Coordinator completes the randomization process in the EDC  system, which will assign to that 
participant a  unique  Enrollment ID  (Random ization Kit) Number.  These numbers are assigned 
in a randomized order, rather than sequentially.  The randomization algorithm and participant 
enrollment process will be implemented through the EDC system using authenticated, password -
protected accounts for  each study site.  The EDC system will check for participant eligibility 
based on inclusion/exclusion page entries  
 
14.2 OUTCOMES  
 
14.2.1 PRIMARY OUTCOME  
The specific primary aims of both stages of this study are to determine whether nilotinib is 
sufficien tly safe and tolerable to warrant future study in a phase III efficacy trial.  
Tolerability : Tolerability will be defined based on the ability to complete the study (6 months 
for cohort 1; 12 months for cohort 2) on the assigned dose.  Any Participant  who h as to be 
removed from study drug, or fails to complete the study (for any reason) will be deemed not to 
have tolerated their assigned medication.  Tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_825722] s enrolled in each dosage group who a re able to complete the study on 
their originally assigned dosage group across all groups within each cohort.  
Safety : Safety will be primarily assessed by [CONTACT_825723] - related 
serious adverse events across all groups within each co hort.

Date: 21 Feb 2018  14.3 ANALYSIS PLAN – COHO RT 1  
 
14.3.1  PRIMARY HYPOTHESES  
Primary Tolerability Hypotheses: To assess whether eithe r 150mg or 300mg once daily 
dosing of nilotinib is sufficiently tolerable, compared to placebo  
Below, we introduce some key notation that we use to describe the analysis plan for the 
proposed trial:  
 Let p150 represent the true (unknown) percentage of participant s treated with 
nilotinib 150mg who will tolerate the assigned medication  
 Let p300 represent the true (unknown) percentage of participant s treated with 
nilotinib 300mg who will tolerate the assigned medication  
 Let pp represent the true (unknown) perce ntage of participant s treated with placebo 
who will tolerate the assigned medication  
 The primary tolerability hypotheses being tested in this trial are that participant s treated with   
either dose of nilotinib will have similar tolerability to participant s treated with placebo.  The 
primary hypotheses will compare the overall tolerability rates for each nilotinib arm vs. placebo 
participant s.  Using the notation above, the two one -sided hypothesis tests below will be 
assessed:  
𝐻01:𝑝150=𝑝𝑃     𝑣𝑠.     𝐻𝐴1:𝑝150<𝑝𝑃 
AND  
𝐻02:𝑝300=𝑝𝑃     𝑣𝑠.     𝐻𝐴2:𝑝300<𝑝𝑃. 
Therefore, rejecting the null hypothesis suggests that the particular dose group of nilotinib shows 
significantly less tol erability relevant to the placebo group.  If we do not  reject the null hypothesis, 
this would provide justification for proceeding with further study of that drug (pending the results 
of the safety assessment).  Each hypothesis will be assessed via a logis tic regression model, 
adjusted for center (stratification variable).  Due to randomization, it is unlikely that important 
covariates will be imbalanced in this study.  However, given the small sample size, this cannot 
be dismissed.  We will assess for impo rtant baseline imbalances, and if any imbalances exist, the 
logistic regression model will also adjust for the relevant covariates with important imbalances 
present.    
Primary Safety Hypothesis:  To assess whether there are clinically important increases  in 
treatment related adverse e vents  for the nilotinib -treated vs. placebo participants.  
 
The set of primary safety hypotheses will involve separate comparisons of the safety profiles for 
each of the nilotinib groups vs. placebo.  As described elsewhere, ge neral assessments of safety 
will occur throughout the trial in conjunction with reviews by [CONTACT_825724] .  This specific

groups will be compared using a Poisson regression model.   In order to provide an overall 
summary of the safety of each nilotinib dose, additional safety assessments will involve further 
comparisons of adverse events, serious adverse events, and safety laboratory findings across the 
two groups.  All of this information will be synthesized and reviewed by [CONTACT_825725].  Notably, this summary information will be critical for 
making the dosing decision for cohort 2 (or deciding not to proceed with cohort 2) at the 
conclusion of follow -up for cohort 1.  
 
 14.3.2  DECISION ALGORITHM B ASED ON PRIMARY HYPO THESES  
At the conclusion of these analyses, a decision rule will be invoked to make a determination 
regarding the “best” dose to move forward with in the second cohort of the study.  This decision 
will be based on a combination of the results from the tolerability and safety hypotheses.  In 
general, the decision algorithm will proceed as follows:  
 Did the 300mg nilotinib group show suitable tolerability?  
o If ‘Yes’, then did the 300mg nilotinib group show suitable safety ? 
 If ‘Yes’, then recommend taking the 300mg nilotinib dose to the second 
cohort  
 If ‘No’ then did the 150 mg nilotinib group show suitable tolerability?  
 If ‘Yes’, then did the 150 mg nilotinib group show suitable safety?  
o If ‘Yes’, then recommend taking the 15 0mg nilotinib dose to 
the second cohort  
o If ‘No’ then recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825617]  
 If ‘No’ then recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825618]  
o If ‘No’, then did the 150mg nilotinib group show suitable tolerability?  
 If ‘Yes’, then did the 150mg nilotinib group show suitable safety?  
 If ‘Yes’ then recommend taking the 150mg nilotinib dose to the 
second cohort

14.3.[ADDRESS_1145034] a single group hypothesis within each PD 
group to assess “futility” for replicating the large difference observed in a previously published 
study9 .  This will be based on a single group hypot hesis test comparing the observed change in 
the MDS -UPDRS part III scores collected ON ( based on the participant/site investigator defined 
best ON and/or approximately [ADDRESS_1145035] ) between baseline and 6 months to the 
observed change reported f rom the Pagan et al9  study in order to determine whether we can rule 
out the large change previously reported.  Based on the results from the Pagan et al9 publication, 
which used the UPDRS:  
 Mean change over 6 months in the 150mg group = 7.0 reduction (std dev = 12.9)  
 Mean change over 6 months in the 300mg group = 10.8 reduction (std dev = 7.8)  
For consistency, we will test a similar hypothesis within e ach group using the smallest observed 
reduction. However, since we will be using the MDS -UPDRS, we include a correction factor of 
1.4 as specified in Goetz et al44.  In other words, the ‘futility’ test will be based on the following 
set of hypotheses:  
H0: δ ≤ -9.8 (7 x 1.4) vs. H A: δ > -9.[ADDRESS_1145036].  
To assess this hypothesis, the following linear mixed effects model (LMM) will be used.  Model 
parameters and variance components will be estimated using restric ted maximum likelihood.  
Several potential covariance structures (unrestricted, independent, compound symmetry, 
autoregressive 1) will be considered, and the model with the lowest AIC value will be selected.  
The following model will be used:  
𝜇𝑖𝑗=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋1+𝛽2𝑋2+𝛽3𝑋3+𝛽4𝑋4+𝛽5𝑋5+𝛽6𝑋6+𝑒𝑖𝑗 
where  
 µij is the difference between the observed MDS -UPDRS part III score for the jth 
visit (day 14, day 30, month 3, month 6) and the MDS -UPDRS part II I score 
observed at baseline for ith participant

Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that a future study is unlikely to observe the large effects 
reported in the Pagan et al (2016) study.  Howev er, that would not rule out potentially meaningful 
effects on a smaller scale.  Furthermore, note that failure to reject the null hypothesis does not 
imply that a significant difference has been observed.  If the null hypothesis is not rejected, or if 
the hypothesis is rejected but the observed differences seem potentially meaningful, further study 
would be warranted.

interaction terms will be assessed initially.  If significant, then the specific terms will be extracted

the change in MDS -UPDRS from baseline to 6 months (evaluated for both the “OFF” 
and “ON” states  
 To assess the degree of symptomatic effect, we will compare both:

 Change in MDS -UPDRS from 6 months (end of treatment) to 7 months ([ADDRESS_1145042] 
treatment) (MDS -UPDRS ON state)  
 
If no significant interaction is observed, then it will be assumed that the effect of ni lotinib is 
consistent over time and a single result will be provided.

 Change in MDS -UPDRS from 12 months (end of treatment) to 13 months ([ADDRESS_1145047] treatment) (MDS -UPDRS ON state )

consistent over time and a single result will be provided.  
Unlike the first cohort, the second cohort involves an early /de novo cohort of PD participant s.  It 
is expected that no participant s will be on ST initially (a s per inclusion/ exclus ion criteria ).  
However , it is expected that many will need to begin ST over the course of the 12 month follow -
up period.  Hence, we will perform this analysis three separate ways:  
 Using ON scores for those on ST, combined with scores for those not yet hav ing 
started ST, over the entire 12 month period  
 Using OFF scores for those on ST, combined with scores for those not yet having 
started ST, over the entire 12 month period  
 Using only MDS -UPDRS part III scores prior to initiation of ST for each participant .  
Note that this analysis will ignore all information collected post initiation of ST for 
each participant , and will thus involve much less data than the other two comparisons

14.5  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFIC ATION  
 
14.5.1 SAMPLE  SIZE – COHORT [ADDRESS_1145049] 90% of 
participant s on placebo will meet the study definition of “tolerability” (completing the study 
on the assigned dose).  Furthermore, it was determined that an absolute decrease of 30 % or 
greater would provide sufficient tolerability concerns that would not warrant further study of

Disease ( PD)

Version  4 
Date: 21 Feb 2018  that dose.  Hence, the sample size was chosen to provide sufficient power to compare an 
expected 90% tolerability rate in the placebo group versus a 60% or lower tolerability rate in 
each of the treatment groups.  Under these assumptions, and considering a one -sided test wi th 
an alpha of 0.05, a total of 25 participant s per group provides 80% power for the 
moderate/advanced cohort.  
For the major secondary obj ective, we utilized preliminary estimates based on results from 
Table 2 in the Pagan et al (2016) study. Using these estimates, we computed the power of the 
study proposed for cohort [ADDRESS_1145050] “futility” based on comparisons of the change within the 
dosage groups themselves. Converting from the UPDRS used in the Pagan et al (2016) study 
to the MDS -UPDRS proposed for this study, the test is set up in the manner described in 
section 15.3.3.  Furthermore, we believe that since the conversion factor maintains the 
relationships between the mean and standard deviation, although the expected values might 
differ the power calculations provided below give a valid estimate of the power for the 
proposed study. Specifically, we assume an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1145051] deviation of 12.9.  The table below shows the power, 
computed across a range of assumed values for the true change from baseline in the nilotinib 
treated participant s.  The table below demonstrates the bene fits of using the futility hypothesis  
(with differences shown in both UPDRS and converted to MDS -UPDRS units) .  When the 
true change in MDS -UPDRS part III over the 6 month treatment period involves an increase 
in scores (implying progression of disease), t he test will declare “futility” with high 
probability.  Likewise, when the true change in MDS -UPDRS part III is equal to or greater 
than the observed change in the Pagan et al (2016) study, the study has a very low change of 
incorrectly declaring futility.    If the observed change in the MDS -UPDRS part III is half that 
observed in the prior study ( a reduction of 3.5), then the study has marginal power (52%) to 
declare futility. If there is no observed reduction associated with treatment, the study has 92% 
power to declare futility. Given the sample size limitations of this study, we feel that this 
provides a reasonable change of addressing the main futility question of interest regarding 
whether the large observed effect in the prior study can be refuted.  T he test of futility will 
have adequate power mainly if the direction of effect is in the opposite direction from that 
observed in the previous study (i.e., if there is no reduction, only a potentially smaller increase 
in MDS -UPDRS over time).  These sample  size calculations were based on the observed 
change for the 150mg group in the Pagan et al study9.  Since bigger effects were observed 
over 6 months for the 300mg group, the study has adequate power for addressing futility in 
the 300mg group in a similar manner.

Date: 21 Feb 2018  14.5.2  SAMPLE SIZE – COHOR T 2 
For the purposes of computing the required sample size for cohort 2, we make similar 
assumptions to those stated above for cohort 1.  Using these assumptions, a sample size of 40 
participant s on the selected dose from cohort 1 and 20 participant s on placebo for the early/de 
novo cohort provides 80% power.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_1145052] OF MISSING D ATA  
The primary analysis will follow the intent -to-treat (ITT) paradigm.  All enrolled participan ts 
must be included in the primary ITT analysis, and will be analyzed in the treatment group to 
which they were initially randomized.  As such, it will be critically important to minimize the 
occurrence of missing data.  Obviously, the optimal strategy for  dealing with missing data is 
to make every effort to obtain complete data during the conduct of the study.  Our team of 
data managers and protocol coordinators will work diligently and use a variety of methods in 
order to minimize the percentage of missin g data in this trial.  Nevertheless, there is likely to 
be a small percentage of missing data.  For the primary analysis, we will take a conservative 
approach and assume that any participant  not completing the study for any reason did not 
tolerate study th erapy.  In order to further assess the potential dependence of the results of the 
primary analysis to these missing values, a series of sensitivity analyses will be conducted.  
We will attempt to collect as much detailed information as possible for partici pants who are 
lost to follow -up or terminate the study early due to any reason.  Any participant s who 
terminate treatment or the study early due to tolerability concerns (AEs) will always be 
counted as not tolerating the dose.  For participant s that do not  provide complete data, and for 
which there is no clear tolerability concern, we will analyze the data using the following 
strategies:  
 Using Only Observed Data (No Imputation)  
 Worst -case scenario: Assume all missing participant s in the treatment group did not 
tolerate the dose and all missing participant s in the placebo group did tolerate the dose  
 Best-case scenario: Assume all missing participant s in the  rituximab  group did 
tolerate the dose and all missing participant s in the placebo group did not tolera te the 
dose.  
The results of these analyses will provide important information regarding the sensitivity of 
the findings to the missing data, and w ill be critical to the Steering Committee  in assessing 
the full value of the study results.

15.1 PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 Pharmacology Objectives  
 Primary Pharmacology Objective  
 To determine the serum  PK of nilotinib in patients with Parkinson’s disease.  
 Secondary Pharmacology Objectives  
 To investigate the ability of nilotinib to cross the blood brain  barrier in 
Parkinson’s disease patients at a dose(s) that is tolerable and safe as 
measured by [CONTACT_2715] -dependent increases in unbound nilotinib levels in the 
CSF.  
 Exploratory Pharmacology Objectives  
 To investigate the relationship between nilotinib exposures  in serum  and CSF 
with its ability to engage known molecular target(s) (measured by [CONTACT_825730] (e .g., reduction in phosphor -cAbl ).  
 To investigate factors that could affect the PK of nilotinib such as age, sex, PD  
severity, race/ethnicity.  
 
15.2 PHARMACOKINETIC ANAL YSIS  
 
 Nilotinib serum  and CSF concentrations will be assayed at a laboratory specified in 
the Laboratory Operational Manual  
 For nilotinib serum  PK, a nonlinear mixed -effects population PK model will be 
developed from the serum  concentration -time data collected from study participants.  
The analysis will focus on characterizing the mean population -level PK parameters  
and variability of nilotinib in PD patients (e.g. apparent oral clearance, volume of 
distribution, etc.).  Participant -level covariates will be incorporated into the 
population PK model to determine their effects on the PK parameters.  Individual 
Bayesian estimates of nilotinib exposure (e.g. apparent oral clearance, Area Under 
the Concentrati on-Time curve, etc.) will be generated from the final population PK 
model to evaluate their association with pharmacodynamics markers.     
 Nilotinib CSF concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_825731] (with 
coefficient of variations) and median values  (with interquartile ranges) in aggregate, 
and compared by [CONTACT_15994].

17.5  DATA  MANAGEMENT      
Utilizing Electronic Data Capture (EDC).   An Internet accessible EDC  system f or data 
management will be utilized for this study.  This system is protected by [ADDRESS_1145059] -protected accounts for each site.  The EDC system is 
designed to ensure timeliness and accuracy of data as wel l as the prompt reporting of data from 
the study on an ongoing basis to the study principal and co -investigators.  The system is compliant 
with relevant FDA regulatory requirements per 21 CFR Part 11.  
 
The BCC  will be responsible for design of the randomiz ation scheme, creation of analytical 
databases, and the statistical analysis plan.  Data management staff at the CTCC  will be 
responsible for all data collection procedures.  
 
Utilizing Electronic Data Capture (EDC):   Data review, coding and query processin g will be 
done through interaction with the CTCC , site personnel and the Study Monitor.  Queries will be 
generated in real -time as the data is entered.  Once data are submitted to the EDC system, it is 
immediately stored in the central study database locat ed at the CTCC and are accessible for 
review by [CONTACT_141418].  Changes to the data will be fully captured in an electronic 
audit trail.  As data recorded by [CONTACT_538207], narrative text of adverse events and 
concomitant medications will be periodically coded using established coding mechanisms.   
 
Utilizing Electronic Data Capture (EDC) : The cycle of electronic data entry, review, query 
identification/resolution, and correction occurs over the course of the study period until all 
participant s have completed the study  and corresponding data has been entered  into the EDC.  
   
Data will be securely transferred to the BCC .  Once the BCC  and CTCC , in conjunction with the 
Sponsor and the Principal Investigator, agree that all queries have b een adequately resolved and 
the database has been deemed “clean”, the database will be officially signed off and deemed 
locked .    All permissions to make changes (append, delete, modify or update) the database are 
removed at this time.   
 
Site personnel, Sponsor , SC and CTCC staff will remain blinded as to treatment assignments 
until after database lock and treatment unblinding at the conclusion of each cohort (cohort 1 and

This study will be conducted under the supervision and direction of the Investigator(s) listed in 
Section 1 of the Form FDA 1572.  Sub -investigators (if required and/or permitted by [CONTACT_1034]) 
are listed in Section 6 of the Form FDA 1572.  The study w ill be conducted at the address ( es) 
listed in Section [ADDRESS_1145060] the study at any s ites other than the one(s) stated on the 
Form FDA 1572.  
 
The protocol, informed consent form, and advertisement notices will be approved by [CONTACT_825740] 5 of the Form FDA 1572.  
 
Each Site Investigator  is responsible for providing copi[INVESTIGATOR_825623], which were furnished to him/her, to all 
physicians and other study personnel responsible to them who participate in this study.  The Site 
Investigator  will discu ss this information with them to assure that they are adequately informed 
regarding the study drug and conduct of the study.  The Site Investigator  must assure that all study 
staff members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience and training to perform thei r specific 
responsibilities.  
 
     
19. CLINICAL SAFETY MONITORING  
Refer to the Safety Management Plan for a detailed description of safety management  
   
19.1 CLINICAL  MONITOR     
The Clinical Monitor (CM) is responsible for frequent review of blinded safet y data  including 
adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory and EKG data .  Additionally, the CM is 
responsible for assisting sites in respond ing appropriately to safety concerns.   If the CM 
encounters significant safety concerns, they will discuss  the severity, importance and relevance 
of the safety concern with the PI, the Site Investigator and the PM and work with all parties to 
determine appropriate action.   Refer to the safety management plan for additional details on the 
Clinical Monitor respo nsibilities.  All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_825741] (GCP) and applicable regulations.   
 
19.2 INDEPENDENT MEDICAL MONITOR  
The Independent Medical Monitor (IMM) will review all serious adverse events on  occurrence 
and reporting  by [CONTACT_825742] , severity, and expectedness . The IMM may determine that the

Date: 21 Feb 2018  Serious Adverse Event  is serious, related  and unexpected and  requires expedited reporting to the 
FDA.  The IMM may communicate with the CM and/or the Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_825624] . Consensus 
between the Site Investigat or and  the IMM  is not required.  In case of disagreement between Site 
Investigator and IMM, IMM adjudication prevails for the reporting purposes. The IMM  will 
alert the CTCC PM and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_825625].  The DSMB may suggest changes to the 
protocol or consent form to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a consequence of adverse  events.  
 
IMM will also review the aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not seri ous, 
expected/unexpected and relationship to study drug) prepared by t he DCC /BCC on an agreed 
upon  basis or as requested . The events will be presented in tabular form and given to the IMM 
and the DSMB on a periodic basis as agreed upon or as requested . IMM  will receive the reports

19.3 STUDY COMMITTEES  
19.3.1 STEERING COMMITTEE      
The Steering Committee  (SC) is composed of the Principal  Investigator , Chief Biostatistician, 
Director of the Coordinating Centers  or designee s, Clinical Monitor (s), participan t representative 
and independent investigator members of the Nilotinib  Study Group with expertise in Parkinson’s  
disease.  The SC is responsible, along with the Sponsor, for the design of the study protocol and 
analysis plan, and oversees the clinical tria l from conception to analysis and publication.  
     
19.3.[ADDRESS_1145061] ( DSMB )    
An independent DSMB will be  appointed and will be responsible for periodic review of the trial 
conduct and progress and safety data (e.g., surveillance laboratory results, adverse events) 
throughout the trial.  The frequency and format of the DSMB meetings, reports, and guidelines 
for interim analysis will be established and documented prior to study participant  enrollment.  
     
19.4 CASE REPORT FORMS     
Utilizing Electronic Data Capture (EDC).   Sites will enter participant  information and data into 
an electronic case report form (eCRF) in the EDC application.  The eCRFs are used to record 
study data and are an integral part of the study and subsequent rep orts.  Therefore, the eCRFs 
must be completed for each participant  screened or enrolled according to the participant ’s source 
data on a per -visit basis. Authorized study personnel will each be granted access to the electronic 
data capture tool via provisio n of a unique password -protected user -ID that will limit access to 
enter and view data specifically for participant s enrolled at their site.

It is the Site Investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that entries are proper and complete.  During 
entry of data, error checks will be performed by [CONTACT_825743] (i.e., missing, out of range, inconsistent) allowing for sites to correct the data at that time.  
Error checks will be implemented in the EDC based upon sp ecifications defined in the data 
management plan.   
 
The data entered from the eCRFs will be securely transmitted to a central database stored on a 
secure server located at the  CTCC .  Upon completion of a participant ’s visit or the study, sites 
have the op tion to print the completed eCRFs depi[INVESTIGATOR_825626].  
 
At the conclusion of the study, the Data Management Team will provided by a PDF (portable 
document format) file on electronic media depi[INVESTIGATOR_825627]. The PDF file should b e 
printed for each participant  participating in the study and filed in the participant ’s binder.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
WARNING: QT PROLONGATION AND SUDDEN DEATHS  
• Tasigna prolongs the QT interval. Prior to Tasigna administration and periodically, monitor for 
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia and correct deficiencies (5.2). Obtain ECGs to monitor the QTc at 
baselin e, seven days after initiation, and periodically thereafter, and following any dose adjustments 
(5.2, 5.3, 5.7, 5.15).  
• Sudden deaths have been reported in patients receiving Tasigna (5.3). Do not administer Tasigna to 
patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnese mia, or long QT syndrome (4, 5.2). 
• Avoid use of concomitant drugs known to prolong the QT interval and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(5.8). 
• Avoid food 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking the dose (5.9).  
1 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]G E 
1.1 Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP 
Tasigna (nilotinib) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase. The effectiveness of Tasigna is based on major molecular response and cytogeneti c response rates [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 
 
1.2 Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML -CP and CML -AP 
Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) in adul t patients resistant or intolerant to prior therapy that included 
imatinib. The effectiveness of Tasigna is based on hematologic and cytogenetic response rates [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].  
[ADDRESS_1145078] 1 hour after the dose is taken. Advise patients to swallow the capsul es whole with water  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and 
Precautions (5.9), Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)] . 
For patients who are unable to swallow capsules, the contents of each capsule may be dispersed in 1  teaspoon of 
applesauce (puréed apple). The mixture should be taken immediately (within 15 minutes) and should not be stored for future use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
Tasigna may be given in combination with hematopoietic growth factors such as erythropoietin or G -CSF if 
clinically indicated. Tasigna may be given with hydroxyurea or anagrelide if clinically indicated.  
Dosage in Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP 
The recommended dose of Tasigna is 300 mg orally twice  daily  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .  
Dosage in Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML -CP and CM L-AP 
The recommended dose of Tasigna (nilotinib) is 400 mg orally twice  daily  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
 
2.2 Discontinuation of treatment after a sustained molecular response  (MR 4.5) on Tasigna  
Patient Selection  
Eligibility for Discontinuation of Treatment  
Ph+ CML -CP patients with typi[INVESTIGATOR_63974] -ABL transcripts who have been taking Tasigna for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1145079] achieved a sustai ned molecular response (MR 4.5, corresponding to = BCR -ABL/ABL ≤ 
0.0032% IS) may be eligible for treatment disc ontinuation [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)] . Information on 
FDA authorized  tests for the detection and quantitation of BCR -ABL transcripts to determine eligibility for 
treatment discontinuation is available at http://www.fda.gov/Companion D iagnostics.   
Patients with t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_63974] -ABL transcripts (i.e., 13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2) who achieve the sustained MR4.[ADDRESS_1145080] to consistently 
monitor molecular response levels while on and off treatment.   
Consider discontinuation of treatment in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP who have :  
• been treated with Tasigna for at least 3 years  
• maintained  a molecular response of at least MR4.0 ( corresponding to = BCR -ABL/ABL ≤  0.01% IS)  for 
one year prior to discontinuation of therapy   
• achieved an MR4.[ADDRESS_1145081] assessment taken immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy   
• been confirmed to express the typi[INVESTIGATOR_63974] -ABL transcripts ( e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2)  
• no history of accelerated phase or blast crisis  
• no history of prior attempts of treatment -free remission discontinua tion that resulted in relapse.  
Consider discontinuation of treatment in  patients with  Ph+ CML -CP that are resistant or intolerant to treatment 
with imatinib who have achieved a sustained molecular response  (MR4.5) on Tasigna  who have :  
• been treated with Ta signa  for a minimum of 3 years  
• been treated with imatinib only prior to treatment with Tasigna  
• achieved  a molecular response of MR.4.5 ( corresponding to =  BCR -ABL/ABL ≤  0.0032% IS)  
• sustained an MR4.5 for a minimum of one year immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy   
• been confirmed to express the typi[INVESTIGATOR_63974] -ABL transcripts ( e13a2/b2a2 or e14a2/b3a2)  
• no history of accelerated phase or blast crisis  
• no history of prior attempts of treatment -free remission discontinuation that resulted in relapse.  
Moni tor BCR -ABL transcript levels and complete blood count with differential in patients who have 
discontinued Tasigna therapy monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the second year , and every 12 weeks 
thereafter  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.18)].  
Upon the loss of MR4.0 ( corresponding to = BCR -ABL/ABL ≤  0.01%IS)  during the treatment- free phase, 
monitor BCR -ABL transcript levels every 2 weeks until BCR -ABL levels remain lower than major molecular 
response (MMR , corresponding to MR3.0 or =  BCR- ABL/ABL ≤  0.1%IS)  for 4 consecutive measurements. 
The patient can  then proceed to the original monitoring schedule.  
 
2.3 Re-initiation of treatment in patients who lose molecular response after discontinuation of therapy 
with Tasigna.  
• Newly diagnosed p atients who lose  MMR  must re -initiate treatment within 4 weeks  at the dose level 
prior to discontinuation of therapy  [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18) ]. Patients who re -initiate 
Tasigna  therapy should have their BCR -ABL transcript levels monitored monthly until major molecular  
response is re -established  and every 12 weeks thereafter .  
• Patients resistant or intolerant to prior treatment that included imatinib with confirmed loss of MR4.0 ( [ADDRESS_1145082] 4 weeks showing loss of MR4.0) or loss of MMR must re -
initiate treatment within 4 weeks at the dose level prior to discontinuation of therapy  [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.18) ]. Patients who re -initiate Tasigna  therapy should have their BCR -ABL transcript 
levels monitored monthly until previous major molecular response or MR 4.0 is re -established  and every 
12 weeks thereafter.

equal to Grade 1  
Other Non -Hematologic Toxicities  
If other clinically significant mo derate or severe non -hematologic toxicity develops, withhold dosing, and 
resume at 400 mg once  daily  when the toxicity has resolved. If clinically appropriate, escalation of the dose 
back to 300 mg (newly diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP) or 400 mg (resistant or intol erant Ph+ CML -CP and CML -
AP) twice  daily  should be considered. For Grade [ADDRESS_1145084] bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels monthly or as clinically indicated  [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.5, 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].  
Hepatic Impairment   
If possible, consider alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If Tasigna must be administered to patients with hepatic impairment, consider the following dose reduction:  
Table 4: Dose Adjustments for Hepatic Impairment (At Baseline)  
Newly diagno sed Ph+ CML in 
chronic phase at 300 mg twice  
daily  Mild , Moderate, or Severe* An initial dosing regimen of 200 mg twice  daily  followed by [CONTACT_825753] 300 mg twice  daily  based on

*Mild=mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A); Moderate=moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh 
Class B); Severe=severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class C)  [see W arnings and Precautions (5.10), Use 
in Specific Populations (8.7)] . 
Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors   
Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir , ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole). Avoid 
grapefruit products since they may also increase serum concentrations of nilotinib. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, therapy with Tasigna should be interrupted. If patients must be coadministered a 
 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, based on pharmacokinetic studies, consider a dose reduction to 300 mg once daily  in 
patients with resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML or to 200 mg once  daily  in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ 
CML -CP. However , there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, a washout period should be allowed before the Tasigna dose is 
adjusted upward to the indicated dose. For patient s who cannot avoid use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor  
closely  for prolongation of the QT interval [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5. 8), Drug 
Interactions (7.2)] . 
Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inducers   
Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital). Also inform patients not to take St. John’s Wort since these agents may reduce the concentration of Tasigna. Based on the nonlinear pharmac okinetic profile of nilotinib, 
increasing the dose of Tasigna when coadministered with such agents is unlikely to compensate for the loss of exposure  [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Tasigna is contraindicated in patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome  [see Boxed 
Warning].
 
5 WARNI NGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 Myelosuppression  
Treatment with Tasigna can cause Grade 3/[ADDRESS_1145087] 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelos uppression was generally reversible and usually managed by [CONTACT_825754] [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 )]. 
5.2 QT Prolongation  
Tasigna has been shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization as measured by [CONTACT_825755] a concentration -dependent manner  [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology  
(12.6)]. Prolongation of the QT interval can result in a type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes, 
which may result in s yncope, seizure, and/or death. ECGs should be performed at baseline, 7 days after 
initiation of Tasigna, and periodically as clinically indicated and following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15 )]. 
Tasigna should not be used in patients w ho have hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or long QT syndrome. Before 
initiating Tasigna and periodically, test electrolyte, calcium and magnesium blood levels. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to initiating Tasigna and these electrolytes sh ould be monitored 
periodically during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15 )]. 
Significant prolongation of the QT interval may occur when Tasigna is inappropriately taken with food and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a know n potential to prolong QT. Therefore, 
coadministration with food must be avoided and concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.9 )]. The presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may further prolong the QT interval [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.15 )]. 
5.[ADDRESS_1145088] been reported in 0.3% of patients with CML treated with nilotinib in clinical studies of 5,[ADDRESS_1145089] contributed to their occurrence.  
 
5.4 Cardiac and Arterial Vascular Oc clusive Events  
Cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events, were reported in a randomized, clinical trial 
in newly diagnosed CML patients and observed in the postmarketing reports of patients receiving nilotinib therapy.  With a median time on therapy of 60 months in the clinical trial,  cardiovascular events, including 
arterial vascular occlusive events, occurred in 9.3% and 15.2% of patients in the Tasigna 300 and 400 mg twice daily  arms, respectively , and in 3.2% in the imatinib arm. These included cases of cardiovascular events 
including  ischemic heart disease- related cardiac events (5.0% and 9.4% in the Tasigna  300 mg and 400 mg 
twice daily  arms respectively, and 2.5% in the imatinib arm), peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( 3.6% and 
2.9% in the Tasigna  300 mg and 400 mg twice daily  arms respectively, and 0% in the imatinib arm), and 
ischemic cerebrovascular events (1. 4% and 3.2% in the Tasigna  300 mg and 400 mg twice daily  arms 
respectively, and 0.7% in the imatinib arm). If acu te signs or symptoms of cardiovascular events occur, advise 
patients to seek immediate medical attention.  The cardiovascular status of patients should be evaluated and 
cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored and actively managed during Tasigna ther apy according to 
standard guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 )]. 
5.[ADDRESS_1145090]/ALT, and alkaline 
phosphatase. Monitor hepatic function tests monthly or as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions  
(5.15)].
 
5.[ADDRESS_1145091] electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating Tasigna  and during therapy. Monitor  these 
electrolytes periodically during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].  
5.8 Drug Interactions  
Avoid administration of Tasigna with agents that may increase nilotinib exposure (e.g., strong CYP3A4 inhibitors) or anti -arrhythmic drugs (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, 
quinidine and sotalol) and other drug s that may prolong QT interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine, 
clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin and pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]). Should treatment with any of these agents be required, interrupt therapy with Tasigna. If interruption of treatme nt with Tasigna is not possible, patients 
who require treatment with a drug that prolongs QT or strongly inhibits CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval  [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4 ), Drug Interactions 
(7.2)].  
5.[ADDRESS_1145092] 1 hour after the dose is taken. Also avoid grapefruit produc ts and other foods that are known to inhibit CYP3A4 [see Boxed Warning, Drug Interactions 
(7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
5.10 Hepatic Impairment  
Nilotinib exposure is increased in patients with impaired hepatic function. Use a lower starting dose  for patients 
with mild to severe hepatic impairment (at baseline) and monitor the QT interval frequently  [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.4 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1145093] been reported i n Tasigna treated patients with resistant or intolerant CML. 
Malignant disease progression, high WBC counts and/or dehydration were present in the majority of these 
cases. Due to potential for tumor lysis syndrome, maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with Tasigna.  
5.[ADDRESS_1145094] occurred in patients with CML treated with Tasigna. In 
a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic  phase comparing Tasigna and 
imatinib ,
 Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 1.1 % of patients in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily  arm, in 1.8% 
patients in the Tasigna 400 mg twice daily  arm, and 0.4% of patients in the imatinib arm. GI hemorrhage 
occurred in 2.9% and 5.1% of patients in the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily  and 400 mg twice daily  arms and in 
1.4% of patients in t he imatinib arm, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 0.7% and 1.4% of patients in 
the Tasigna 300 mg twice daily  and 400 mg twice d aily arms, respectively, and in no patients in the imatinib 
arm.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding and medically manage as needed.  
5.13 Total Gastrectomy  
Since the exposure of nilotinib is reduced in patients with total gastrectomy, perform more  frequent monitoring 
of these patients. Consider dose increase or alternative therapy in patients with total gastrectomy  [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
5.[ADDRESS_1145095] 2 months and then monthly thereafter. 
Perform c hemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium,  liver enzymes,  lipid profile,  and glucose  
prior to therapy and periodically . ECGs should be obtained at baseline, 7 days a fter initiation and periodically 
thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Monitor  lipid profile s 
and glucose periodically during the first year of  Tasigna  therapy  and at least yearly during chronic therapy. 
Should treatment with any HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid 
elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug- drug interaction before initiating therapy  as certain HMG -CoA 
reductase inhibitors are metabolized by [CONTACT_825756] P3A4 pathway  [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Assess glucose 
levels before initiating treatment with Tasigna and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physician should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines.  
5.16  Fluid Retention  
In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+  CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid 
retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily  and 400 mg twice daily , 
respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions  (including pleural effusion, pericardial 
effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema , were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg 
twice daily  and 400 mg twice dai ly, respectively, and in 2.1% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions were 
severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 0.7% and 0.4% of patients receiving Tasigna 300 mg twice daily  and 400 mg twice 
daily , respectively, and in no patients receiving imatinib. Similar events  were also observed in postmarketing 
reports. Monitor patients for signs of severe fluid retention (e.g., unexpected rapid weight gain or swelling) and for symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_026] c ardiac compromise  (e.g., shortness of breath)  during Tasigna treatment; 
evaluate etiology and treat patients accordingly.  
 
5.17 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Tasigna can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administrati on of nilotinib to pregnant rats 
and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo -fetal lethality/fetal 
effects (small renal papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387], fetal edema, and skeletal variations) in rats and increased resorptions  of fetuses and 
fetal skeletal variations in rabbits at maternal AUCs approximately [ADDRESS_1145096] dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. 
5.[ADDRESS_1145097] MR4.5 (BCR -ABL/ABL ≤  
0.0032% IS). In patients who discontinue Tasigna therapy, assess BCR -ABL transcript levels monthly  for one 
year, then every 6 weeks for the second year, and every 12 weeks thereafter  during treatment discontinuation 
[see Clinical Studies (14.3,14.4)  and Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .  
Newly diagnosed patients must r einitiate Tasigna therapy within 4 weeks of a loss of Major Molecular 
Response (MMR , corresponding to MR3.0 or  = BCR- ABL/ABL ≤  0.1%IS) .  
Patients resistant or intolerant to prior treatment which included imatinib must reinitiate Tasigna therapy within 
4 weeks of a loss of MMR  or confirmed loss of MR4.0 (two consecutive measures separated by [CONTACT_2669] 4 weeks 
showing l oss of MR4.0, corresponding to = BCR -ABL/ABL ≤  0.01%IS ).  
For patients who fail to achieve MMR after three months of treatment re initiation, BCR -ABL kinase domain 
mutation testing should be performed.  
Monitoring of BCR- ABL Transcript Levels in Patients who have Reinitiated Therapy after Los s of Molecular 
Response  
Monitor CBC and BCR -ABL transcripts in p atients who re -initiate treatment with  Tasigna due to loss of 
molecular response quantitation every 4 weeks until a major molecular response is re -establish ed, then every 12 
weeks.  
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The following serious adverse reactions can occur with Tasigna and are discussed in greater detail in other 
sections of labeling: 
• Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  
• QT P rolongation [see Boxed  Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]  
• Sudden D eaths [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  
• Cardiac and Arterial Vascular  Occlusive Events  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  
• Pancreatitis and Elevated S erum Lipase [see Warnings and Precaut ions (5. 5)] 
• Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]  
• Electrolyte A bnormalities [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )] 
• Hemorrhage  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]

6.[ADDRESS_1145098] the rates observed in practice.  
 
In Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP 
The data below reflect exposure to Tasigna from a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML 
in chronic phase treated at the recommended dose of 300 mg twice  daily  (n=27 9). The median time on 
treatment in the nilotinib 300 mg twice  daily group was 61 months  (range 0.1  to 71 months). The median actual 
dose intensity was 593 mg/day in the nilotinib [ADDRESS_1145099] common ( greater than 10%) non- hematologic  adverse drug reactions were  rash, pruritus, headache, 
nausea, fatigue, alopecia , myalgia , and upper abdominal pain. C onstipation, diarrhea, dry skin, muscle spasms, 
arthralgia, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, vomiting, and asthenia were observed less commonly ( less than or 
equal to 10% and greater than 5%) and have been of mild- to-moderate severity, manageable and generally did 
not require dose reduction.  
Increase in QTcF greater than 60 msec from baseline was observed in 1 patient (0.4%) in the [ADDRESS_1145100] common hematologic adverse drug reactions (all grades) were myelosuppression including: 
thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia (15%) and anemia  (8%). See Table 7 for Grade 3/4 laboratory 
abnormalities.  
Discontinuation due to adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, was observed in 10% of patients.  
In Patients with Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML -CP and CML -AP 
In the single ope n-label multicenter clinical trial, a total of 458 patients with Ph+ CML -CP and CML -AP 
resistant to or intolerant to at least one prior therapy including imatinib were treated (CML -CP=321; CML -
AP=137) at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily . 
The medi an duration of exposure in days for CML -CP and CML -AP patients is 561 (range 1 to 1096) and 264 
(range 2  to 1160), respectively. The median dose intensity for patients with CML -CP and CML -AP is 789 
mg/day (range 151 to 1110) and 780 mg/day (range 150 to 1149), respectively and corresponded to the planned 400 mg twice  daily dosing.  
The median cumulative duration in days of dose interruptions for the CML -CP patients was 20 (range 1  to 345), 
and the median duration in days of dose interruptions for the CML -AP patients was 23 (range 1 to 234). 
In patients with CML -CP, the most commonly reported non- hematologic adverse drug reactions ( greater than or 
equal  to 10%) were rash, pruritus, nausea, fatigue, headache, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting and myalgia. The 
common serious drug -related adverse reactions ( greater than or equal to 1% and less than 10%) were 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia.  
In patients with CML -AP, the most commonly reported non- hematologic adverse drug reactions ( greater than or 
equal to 10%) were rash, pruritus and fatigue . The common serious adverse drug reactions ( greater than or 
equal to 1%
 and less than 10%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, 
leukopenia, intracranial hemorrhage, elevated lipase and pyr exia.  
Sudden deaths and QT prolongation were reported. T he maximum mean QTcF change from baseline at steady -
state was 10 msec. Increase in QTcF greater than 60 msec from baseline was observed in 4.1% of the patients 
and QTcF of greater than 500 msec was observed in 4 patients ( less than 1%) [see Boxed Warning, Warnings 
and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)] . 
Discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions was observed in 16% of CML -CP and 10% of CML -AP patients.

[ADDRESS_1145104] that nilot inib 
may induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9, and decrease the concentrations of drugs which are eliminated by [CONTACT_36918].  
In patients with  CML , multiple doses of Tasigna increased the systemic exposure of oral midazolam (a substrate 
of CYP3A4) 2.6- fold. T asigna  is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. As a result, the systemic exposure of drugs 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (e.g., certain HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors) may be increased when coadministered 
with Tasigna . Dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates , especially those that 
have narrow therapeutic indices  (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl,  
sirolimus and tacrolimus) when coadmi nistered with Tasigna . 
Single -dose administration of Tasigna to healthy subjects did not change the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). The ability of multiple doses of Tasigna to induce metabolism of drugs other than midazolam has not been determined in vivo. Monitor patients  closely  when 
coad ministering Tasigna with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index  and are substrates for CYP 2B6, 
CYP 2C8, or CYP2C 9 enzymes . 
Nilotinib inhibits human P -glycoprotein (P -gp).
 If Tasigna is administered with drugs that are substrates of P -
gp, increased conce ntrations of the substrate drug are likely, and caution should be exercised.  
7.2 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce Cytochrome P450 3A4 Enzymes  
Nilotinib undergoes metabolism by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and concomitant administration of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 ca n increase or decrease nilotinib concentrations significantly. Avoid t he administration of Tasigna 
with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2. 4), 
Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.8 )]. Concomitant use of T asigna with medicinal products and herbal 
preparations that are potent inducers of CYP3A4 is likely to reduce exposure to nilotinib to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, in patients receiving Tasigna, select alternative therapeutic agents with less p otential for 
CYP3A4 induction for concomitant use .  
Ketoconazole : In healthy subjects receiving ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 400 mg once  daily  for 6 days, 
systemic exposure (AUC) to nilotinib was increased approximately 3- fold. 
Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513] : In healt hy subjects receiving the CYP3A4 inducer, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], at 600 mg daily for 12 days, 
systemic exposure (AUC) to nilotinib was decreased approximately 80%.  
7.[ADDRESS_1145105] Gastric pH  
The concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors with Tasigna is not recommended. Nilotinib has pH -dependent 
solubility, with decreased solubility at higher pH. Drugs such as proton pump inhibitors that inhibit gastric acid secretion to elevate the gastric pH may decrease the solubility of nilotinib and reduce its bioavailability. In 
 
healthy subjects, coadministration of a single 400 mg dose of Tasigna with multiple doses of esomeprazole (a 
proton- pump inhibitor) at 40 mg daily decreased the nilotinib AUC by 34%. Increasing the dose of Tasigna 
when coadministered with such agent s is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Since proton pump 
inhibitors affect pH of the upper GI tract for an extended period, separation of doses may not eliminate the interaction.  
In healthy subjects, no significant change in nilotinib pha rmacokinetics was observed when a single 400 mg 
dose of Tasigna was administered 10 hours after and 2 hours before famotidine (an H2 blocker). Therefore, when the concurrent use of a H2 blocker is necessary, it may be administered approximately 10 hours be fore 
and approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna.  
Administration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone) to healthy subjects, 2 
hours before or 2 hours after a single 400 mg dose of Tasigna did not alter nilotinib pharma cokinetics. 
Therefore, if necessary, an antacid may be administered approximately 2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna.  
7.4 Drugs that Inhibit Drug Transport Systems  
Nilotinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P -glycoprotein (P -gp, ABCB1). If Tasigna is administered with 
drugs that inhibit P -gp, increased concentrations of nilotinib are likely, and caution should be exercised. 
7.5 Drugs that May Prolong the QT Interval  
The administration of Tasigna with agents that may pr olong the QT interval such as anti -arrhythmic medicines 
should be avoided [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 
5.8)] . 
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPU LATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, Tasigna can cause fetal  harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . 
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug -associated risk . In animal reproduction 
studies, admini stration of nilotinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse 
developmental outcomes including embryo -fetal lethality, fetal effects, and fetal variations  in rats and rabbits at 
maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 2 and 0.5 time s, respectively, the exposures in patients at the 
recommended dose ( see Data ). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.  
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. I n the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2- 4% and 15- 20%, respectively . 
Data  
Animal Data  
In embryo- fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of nilotinib up to 
100 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis.  
In rats, oral administration of nilotinib  produced embryo- lethality/fetal effects at do ses ≥ 30 mg/kg/day. At ≥ 30 
mg/kg/day s keletal variations of incomplete ossification of the frontals and misshapen sternebra were noted, and 
there was an increased incidence of small renal papi[INVESTIGATOR_825631] f etal edema. At 100 mg/kg/day, nilotinib was 
associated  with maternal toxicity ( decreased gestation weight, gravid uterine weight, net weight gain, and food 
consumption) and resulted in a single incidence of cleft palate and two incidences of pale skin were noted in the fetuses. A single incidence of dilated u reters was noted in a fetus also displaying small renal papi[INVESTIGATOR_825632] 100 
 
mg/kg/day. A dditional variations of forepaw and hindpaw phalanx unossified, fused sternebra, bipartite 
sternebra ossification, and incomplete ossification of the cervical vertebra were noted at 100 mg/kg/day.  
In rabbits, oral administration of nilotinib  resulted in the early sacrifice of two  females, maternal toxicity and 
increased resorption of fetuses at 300 mg/kg/day. Fetal skeletal variations (incomplete ossification of the hyoid, 
bent hyoid, supernumerary short detached ribs and the presence of additional ossification sites near the nasals, 
frontals and in the sternebral column) were also increased at this dose in the presence of maternal toxicity. Slight maternal toxicity was eviden t at 100 mg/kg/day but there were no reproductive or embryo- fetal effects at 
this dose. 
At 30 mg/kg/day in rats  and 300 mg/kg/day in rabbits , the maternal systemic exposure (AUC) were [ZIP_CODE] 
ng*hr/mL and [ZIP_CODE] ng*hr/mL  respectively , representing approximate ly [ADDRESS_1145106] recommended dose 400 mg twice daily . 
When pregnan t rats were dosed with nilotinib  during organogenesis and through lactation, the adverse effects 
included a longer gestational period, lower pup body weights until weaning and decreased fertility indices in the 
pups when they reached maturity, all at a maternal dose of 60 mg/kg (i.e., 360 mg/m
2, approximately 0.7 times 
the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily  based on body surface area) . At doses up to 20 mg/kg (i.e., 120 mg/m2, 
approximately 0.25 times the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily  based on body surface area) no adverse effects 
were seen in the maternal animals or the pups.  
8.[ADDRESS_1145107] dose.  
Animal Data 
After a single 20 mg/kg of [14C] nilotinib dose to lactating rats, the transfer of parent drug and its metabolites 
into milk was observed. Th e overall milk -to-plasma exposure ratio of total radioactivity was approximately 2, 
based on the AUC 0-24h or AUC 0-∞ values . No rat metabolites of nilotinib were detected that were unique to milk. 
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential  
Pregnancy  
Based on animal studies, Tasigna can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman  [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1)] . Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting 
treatment with Tasigna.  
Contraception 
Females  
Based on animal studies, Tasigna can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1)] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during 
treatment with Tasigna and for at least [ADDRESS_1145108] dose . 
Infertility  
The risk of infertility in females or males of reproductive potential has not been studied in humans. In studies in rats and rabbits, the fertility in males and females was not affected [see Nonclincal Toxicology (13. 1)].

8.5 Geriatric Use  
In the clinical trials of Tasigna (patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP and resistant or intolerant Ph+ 
CML -CP and CML -AP), approximately 12% and 30% of patients were 65 years or over respectively.  
• Patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP: There was no difference in major molecular response between 
patients aged  less than 65 years and those greater than or equal to 65 years.  
• Patients with resistant or intolerant CML -CP: There was no difference in major cytogenetic response rate 
between patients aged less than 65 years and those greater than or equal to 65 years.  
• Patients with resistant or intolerant CML -AP: The hematologic res ponse rate was 44% in patients less than 
65 years of age and 29% in patients greater than or equal to 65 years.  
No major differences for safety were observed in patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age as compared 
to patients less than 65 years.  
8.6 Cardiac Disorders  
In the clinical trials, patients with a history of uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or clinically significant bradycardia, were exclud ed. Caution should be exercised in patients with relevant cardiac disorders [see Boxed Warning, 
Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].  
8.7 Hepatic Impairment  
Nilotinib exposure is increased in patients with impaired hepatic function. In a study of subjects with mild to severe hepatic impairment following a single dose administration of 200 mg of Tasigna, the mean AUC values were increased on average of 35%, 35%, and 56% in subjects with mild (Child -Pugh class A, score 5 to 6), 
moderate (Child -Pugh class B, score 7 to 9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh class C, score 10 to 
15), respectively, compared to a control group of subjects with normal hepatic function. Table 9 summarizes the Child -Pugh Liver Function Classification applied in this study. A lower s tarting dose is recommended in 
patients with hepatic impairment and the QT interval should be monitored closely in these patients  [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.4 ), and Warnings and Precautions (5.10 )].

10 OVERDOSAGE  
Overdose with nilotinib has been reported, where an unspecified number of Tasigna capsules were ingested in combination with alcohol and other drugs . Events included neutropenia, vomiting, and drowsine ss. In the event 
of overdose, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given.  
 
11 DESCRIPTION  
Tasigna (nilotinib) belongs to a pharmacologic class of drugs known as kinase inhibitors. 
Nilotinib drug substance, a monohydrate monohy drochloride, is a white to slightly yellowish to slightly 
greenish yellow powder with the anhydrous  molecular formula and weight, respectively, of C 28H22F3N7O•HCl • 
H2O and 584. The solubility of nilotinib in aqueous solutions decreases with increasing pH. Nilotinib is not 
optically active. The pK a1 was determined to be 2.1; pK a2 was estimated to be 5.4. 
The chemical name [CONTACT_825770] 4 -methyl- N-[3-(4-methyl- 1H-imidazol- 1-yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] -3-
[[4-(3-pyridinyl) -2-pyrimidinyl]amino] -benzamide, monohydrochloride, monohydrate . Its structure is shown 
below:  
 
Tasigna (nilotinib) capsules, for oral use, contain 150 mg or 200 mg nilotinib base, anhydrous (as 
hydrochloride , monohydrate) with the following inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxid e, crospovidone, 
lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and poloxamer 188. The capsules contain gelatin, iron oxide (red), iron oxide (yellow), iron oxide (black), and titanium dioxide. 
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y 
12.1 Mechanism of Action  
Nilotinib is an inh ibitor of the BCR -ABL kinase. Nilotinib binds to and stabilizes the inactive conformation of 
the kinase domain of ABL protein. In vitro, nilotinib inhibited BCR -ABL mediated proliferation of murine 
leukemic cell lines and human cell lines derived from patients with Ph+ CML. Under the conditions of the 
assays, nilotinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR -ABL kinase mutations, in 32 out 
of 33 mutations tested. In vivo, nilotinib reduced the tumor size in a murine BCR -ABL xenograft mod el. 
Nilotinib inhibited the autophosphorylation of the following kinases at IC50 values as indicated: BCR -ABL (20 
to 60 nM), PDGFR (69 nM), c -KIT (210 nM), CSF -1R (125 to 250 nM), and DDR1 (3.7 nM).  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption and Distribution   
The ab solute bioavailability of nilotinib has not been determined. As compared to an oral drink solution (pH of 
1.2 to 1.3), relative bioavailability of nilotinib capsule is approximately 50%. Peak concentrations of nilotinib are reached 3 hours after oral admin istration.  
Steady -state nilotinib exposure was dose -dependent with less than dose -proportional increases in systemic 
exposure at dose levels higher than 400 mg given as once  daily dosing . Daily serum exposure to nilotinib 
following 400 mg twice  daily dosin g at steady state was 35% higher than with 800 mg once  daily dosing. 
Steady state exposure (AUC) of nilotinib with 400 mg twice  daily dosing was 13% higher than with [ADDRESS_1145110] ed state, the 
systemic exposure (AUC) increased by 82% when the dose was given [ADDRESS_1145111] capsules. The blood- to-serum ratio of nilotinib is 0.68. Serum protein binding is approximately 98% on 
the basis of in vitro  experiments.  
Median steady -state trough concentration  of nilotinib was decreased by 53% in patients with total gastrectomy 
compared to patients who had not undergone surgeries  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13 )]. 
Pharmacokinetics, Metabolism and Excretion  
The apparent elimination half -life estimated from the multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies with daily dosing 
was approximately 17 hours. Inter -patient variability in nilotinib AUC was 32% to 64%. Steady state conditions 
were achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 8. An increase in serum exposure to nilotinib between the first dose and steady state was approximately 2 -fold for daily dosing and 3.8- fold for twice  daily dosing.  
Main metabolic pathways identified in healthy subjects are oxidation and hydroxylation. Nilotinib is the main circulating component in the serum. None of the metabolites contribute significantly to the pharmacological activity of nilotinib.  
After a single dose of radiolabeled nilotinib in healthy subjects, more than 90% of the administered dose was eliminated within 7 days: mainly in feces (93% of the dose) . Parent drug accounted for 69% of the dose. 
Age, body weight, gender, or ethnic origin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. 
Renal Impairment  
Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. Clinic al studies have 
excluded patients with serum creatinine concentration  greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range.  
Since nilotinib and its metabolites are not renally excreted, a decrease in total body clearance is not anticipated 
in patient s with renal impairment.  
Drug -Drug Interactions  
In a Phase 1 trial of nilotinib 400 mg twice  daily  in combination with imatinib 400 mg daily or 400 mg twice  
daily , the AUC increased 30%  to 50% for nilotinib and approximately 20% for imatinib. 
12.5 Pharmaco genomics  
Tasigna can increase bilirubin levels. A pharmacogenetic analysis of 97 patients evaluated the polymorphisms of UGT1A1 and its potential association with hyperbilirubinemia during Tasigna treatment. In this study, the 
(TA)7/(TA)7 genotype was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of hyperbilirubinemia relative to the (TA)6/(TA)6 and (TA)6/(TA)[ADDRESS_1145112] increases in bilirubin were observed in the (TA)7/(TA)7 genotype (UGT1A1*28) patients  [see Warnin gs and Precautions (5.6 )]. 
12.6 QT/QTc Prolongation  
In a placebo -controlled study in healthy volunteers designed to assess the effects of Tasigna on the QT interval, 
administration of Tasigna was associated with concentration -dependent QT prolongation; the  maximum mean 
placebo -adjusted QTcF change from baseline was 18 msec (1 -sided 95% Upper CI: 26 msec) . A positive 
control was not included in the QT study of healthy volunteers. Peak plasma concentrations in the QT study were 26% lower than those observed i n patients enrolled in the single -arm study  [see Boxed Warning, Warnings 
and Precautions (5.2) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].  
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLO GY 
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted o rally in rats at nilotinib doses of 5, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day. 
Exposures in animals at the highest dose tested were approximately 2 - to 3- fold the human exposure (based on 
 
AUC) at the nilotinib dose of 400 mg twice  daily . The study was negative for carcinoge nic findings. A 26- week  
carcinogenicity study was conducted orally in Tg.rasH2 mice , a model genetically modified to enhance 
susceptibility to neoplastic transformation , at nilotinib doses of  30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day . Nilotinib induced 
in the skin and subcutis statistically significant increases in the incidence of papi[INVESTIGATOR_825633] s and carcino mas in males at 300 mg/kg/day.  The no-observed -adverse-
effect-level (NOAEL) for skin neoplastic lesions was 100 mg/kg/ day.  
Nilotinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a chromosome 
aberration assay in human lymphocytes, did not induce DNA damage (comet assay) in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vi vo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay with two oral 
treatments at doses up to 2000 mg/kg/dose.  
There were no effects on male or female rat and female rabbit mating or fertility at doses up to 180 mg/kg in rats (approximately 4 - to 7- fold for males and fema les, respectively, the AUC in patients at the dose of 400 mg 
twice  daily ) or 300 mg/kg in rabbits (approximately one -half the AUC in patients at the dose of 400 mg twice  
daily ). The effect of Tasigna on human fertility is unknown. In a study where male and female rats were treated 
with nilotinib at oral doses of 20 to 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 1-  to 6.6- fold the AUC in patients at the dose 
of 400 mg twice  daily ) during the pre -mating and mating periods and then mated, and dosing of pregnant rats 
continue d through gestation Day 6, nilotinib increased post -implantation loss and early resorption, and 
decreased the number of viable fetuses and litter size at all doses tested.  
14 CLINICAL STUDIES  
14.1 Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP 
The ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotini b Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials -Newly Diagnosed patients)  study  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  was an open- label, multicenter, randomized trial conducted to determine the efficacy of 
Tasigna versus imatinib tablets in adult patients with cytogenetically confirmed newly diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP. 
Patients were within 6 months of diagnosis and were previously untreated for CML -CP, except for hydroxyurea 
and/or anagrelide. Efficacy was based on a total of 846 patients: 283 patients in the imatinib 400 mg once  daily 
group, 282 patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice  daily group, 281 patients in the nilotinib 400 mg twice  daily 
group.  
Median age was 46 years in the imatinib group and 47 years in both nilotinib groups, with 12%, 13%, and 10% of patients greater than or equal to  65 years of age in imatinib 400 mg once  daily , nilotinib 300 mg twice  daily 
and nilotinib 400 mg twice  daily treatment groups, respectively. There were slightly more male than female 
patients in all groups (56%, 56%, and 62% in imatinib 400 mg once  daily , nilotinib 300 mg twice  daily  and 
nilotinib 400 mg twice  daily  treatment groups, respectively). More than 60% of all patients were Caucasian, and 
25% were Asian.  
The primary data analysis was performed when all 846 patients completed 12 months of treatment  (or 
discontinued earlier). Subsequent analyses were done when patients completed 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of treatment (or discontinued earlier). The median time on treatment was approximately 61 months in all three treatment groups.  
The primary efficacy  endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months after the start of study 
medication. MMR was defined as less than or equal to 0.1% BCR -ABL/ABL % by [CONTACT_825759] -PCR, which corresponds to a greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1145113] crisis  (both within the first 6 
months of treatment ) while  [ADDRESS_1145114] crisis 
([ADDRESS_1145115] 6 months, 2 patients within 6  to 12 months, 2 patients within 12 to 18 months and 1 
patient  within 18 to 24 months).

By [CONTACT_941] 60 months, MMR was achieved by 77% of patients on Tasigna and 60% of patients on imatinib; MR4.5 
was achieved by 53.5% of patients on Tas igna and 31.4% on imatinib. Median overall survival was not reached 
in either arm. At the time of the 60 -month final analysis, the estimated survival rate was 93.7% for patients on 
Tasigna  and 91.7% for patients on imatinib.   
14.2 Patients with Resistant o r Intolerant Ph+ CML -CP and CML -AP 
Study CAMN107 A2101 (referred to as Study A2101) ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a single -arm, open -label, 
multicenter study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tasigna (400 mg twice  daily ) in patients with 
imatinib -resista nt or - intolerant CML with separate cohorts for chronic and accelerated phase disease. The 
definition of imatinib resistance included failure to achieve a complete hematologic response (by 3 months), cytogenetic response (by 6 months) or major cytogenetic response (by 12 months) or progression of disease after a previous cytogenetic or hematologic response . Imatinib intolerance was defined as discontinuation of 
treatment due to toxicity and lack of a major cytogenetic response at time of study entry . At the  time of data cut -
off, 321 patients with CML -CP and 137 patients with CML -AP with a minimum follow -up of 24 months were 
enrolled. In this study, about 50% of CML -CP and CML -AP patients were males, over 90% (CML -CP) and 
80% (CML -AP) were Caucasian, and appr oximately 30% were age 65 years or older . 
Overall, 73% of patients were imatinib resistant while 27% were imatinib intolerant. The median time of prior imatinib treatment was approximately 32 (CML -CP) and 28 (CML -AP) months . Prior therapy included 
hydroxyu rea in 85% of patients, interferon in 56% and stem cell or bone marrow transplant in 8% . The median 
highest prior imatinib dose was [ADDRESS_1145116] prior 
imatinib dose was greater than or equal to 600 mg/ day in 74% of all patients with 40% of patients receiving 
imatinib doses greater than or equal to 800 mg/day . 
Median duration of nilotinib treatment was 18.4 months in patients with CML -CP and 8.7 months in patients 
with CML -AP. 
The efficacy endpoint in CM L-CP was unconfirmed major cytogenetic response (MCyR) which included 
complete and partial cytogenetic responses . 
The efficacy endpoint in CML -AP was confirmed hematologic response (HR), defined as either a complete 
hematologic response (CHR) or no evidenc e of leukemia (NEL) . The rates of response for CML -CP and CML -
AP patients are reported in Table 11.  
Median durations of response had not been reached at the time of data analysis.

5% myelocytes + metamyelocytes in bone marrow,  less than 20% basophils in peripheral blood, and no extramedullary involvement.  
CHR (CML -AP): neutrophils greater than or equal to  1.5 x 109/L, platelets greater than or equal to  100 x 109/L, no myeloblasts in 
peripheral blood, myeloblasts  less than 5% in bone marrow, and no extramedullary involvement.  
NEL: same criteria as for CHR but neutrophils greater than or equal to  1.0 x 109/L and platelets greater  than or equal to  20 x 109/L 
without transfusions or bleeding.  
Patients with Chronic Phase  
The MCyR rate in 321 CML -CP patients was 51%. The median time to MCyR among responders was 2.8 
months (range 1 to 28 months). The median duration of MCyR cannot be e stimated. The median duration of 
exposure on this single arm -trial was 18.4 months. Among the CML -CP patients who achieved MCyR, 62% of 
them had MCyR lasting more than 18 months. The CCyR rate was 37%.  
Patients with  Accelerated Phase 
The overall confirmed  hematologic response rate in 137 patients with CML -AP was 39%. The median time to 
first hematologic response among responders was 1 month (range 1 to 14 months). Among the CML -AP 
patients who achieved HR, 44% of them had a response lasting for more than 18 months. 
After imatinib failure, 24 different BCR -ABL mutations were noted in 42% of chronic phase and 54% of 
accelerated phase CML patients who were evaluated for mutations.  
14.3 Treatment discontinuation in newly diagnosed Ph+ CML -CP patients who have achieved a 
sustained molecular response  (MR4.5)  
The ENESTfreedom ( Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials -freedom ) study  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is  an open -label, multicenter, single -arm study, where 215 adult patients with Ph+ CML -CP 
treated with  Tasigna  in first -line for ≥  2 years who achieved MR4.5 as measured with the MolecularMD 
MRDx™ BCR- ABL Test were enrolled to continue Tasigna  treatment for an additional 52 weeks ( Tasigna  
consolidation phase).  
Of the 215 patients, 190 patients (88.4%) ent ered the “Treatment -free Remission” (TFR) phase after achieving a 
sustained molecular response (MR4.5) during the consolidation phase, defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• The [ADDRESS_1145117] quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) were at least MR4 (BCR -ABL/ ABL  
≤ 0.01% IS), and maintained for 1 year  
• The last assessment being MR4.5 (BCR -ABL/ABL ≤  0.0032% IS)  
• No more than two assessments falling between MR4 and MR4.5 (0.0032% IS < BCR -ABL/ABL 
≤ 0.01% IS).  
 
The median age of patients who entered the TFR phase was 55 years, 49.5%  were females , and 21.1% of the 
patients were ≥  [ADDRESS_1145118] 48 weeks of 
the TFR phase. Monitoring frequency was intensified to every 2 weeks upon the loss of MR4.0. Biweekly  
monitoring ended at one of the following time points:  
• Loss of MMR requiring patient to re -initiate Tasigna  treatment  
• When the BCR -ABL levels returned to a range between MR4.0 and MR4.5 
• When the BCR -ABL levels remained lower than MMR for 4 consecutiv e measurements (8 
weeks from initial loss of MR4.0).  
Any patient with loss of MMR during the TFR phase re -initiated Tasigna  treatment at [ADDRESS_1145119] 24 weeks and then every 12 weeks 
thereafter in patien ts who regained MMR.  
Efficacy was based on the 96- week analysis data cut -off date, by [CONTACT_152982], 91 patients (4 7.9%) discontinued 
from the TFR phase due to loss of MMR, and 1 (0.5%), 1 (0.5%), 1 (0.5%) and 3 patients (1.6%) due to death 
from unknown cause , physician decision, lost to follow -up and subject decision, respectively. Among the 91 
patients who discontinued the TFR phase due to loss of MMR, 88 patients restarted Tasigna  treatment and 3 
patients permanently discontinued from the study.  
By [CONTACT_941] 96- week data cut -off, of the 8 8 patients who restarted treatment due to loss of MMR in the TFR phase, 
87 patients (98.9%) patients regained MMR (one patient discontinued study permanently due to subject decision  after 7.1 weeks of retreatment without regaining  MMR ) and 81 patients ( 92.0%) regained MR4.5 by 
[CONTACT_825761]- off date. The cumulative rate of MMR and MR4.5 regained at 24 weeks since treatment re 
initiation was 97.7% (86/88 patients) and 86.4% (76/88 patients), respectively.

14.4 Treatment discontinuation in Ph+ CML -CP patients who have achieved a sustained molecular 
response (MR4.5) on Tasigna following prior imatinib therapy  
The ENESTop ( Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in clinical Trials -STop) study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is  an 
open- label, multicenter, single -arm study, where 163 adult patients with Ph+ CML -CP taking tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) for ≥  3 years (imatinib as initial TKI therapy for more than [ADDRESS_1145121] 2 years), and who 
achieved MR4.5 on Tasigna  treatment as measured with the MolecularMD MRDx™ BCR -ABL Test were 
enrolled to continue Tasigna  treatment for an additional 52 weeks ( Tasigna  consolidation phase). Of the 163 
patients, 126 patients (77.3%) entered the TFR phase after achieving a sustained molecular response (MR4.5) 
during the consolidation phase, defined by [CONTACT_297217]:  
• The [ADDRESS_1145122] quarterly assessments (taken every 12 weeks) showed no confirmed loss of MR4.5 (BCR -ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS) during 1 year.  
The median age  of patients who entered the TFR phase  was 56  years , 55.6 % were females , and 27.8% of the 
patients were ≥  65 years of age. The median actual dose intensity during the 52- week Tasigna consolidation 
phase was 771.8 mg/day with 52.4%, 29.4%, 0.8%, 16.7% and 0.8% of patients receiving a daily Tasigna dose of [ADDRESS_1145123] before entry into the TFR phase, respectively.  
Patients who entered the TFR phase but experienced two consecutive measu rements of BCR -ABL/ABL >  
0.01% IS were considered having a confirmed loss of MR4.0, triggering re -initiation of Tasigna  treatment. 
Patients with loss of MMR in the TFR phase immediately restarted Tasigna  treatment without confirmation. All 
patients who res tarted Tasigna  therapy had BCR -ABL transcript levels monitored every [ADDRESS_1145124] 24 
weeks, then once every 12 weeks.  
Efficacy was based on  the 96 -week analysis data cut -off date,  by [CONTACT_152982], 61 patients (48.4%) had 
discontinued from the TFR phase: 58 patients (4 6.0%) due to loss of MMR  or confirm loss of MR4.0, 2 patients  
(1.6%)  due to subject/guardian decision and one patient (0.8%) due to pregnancy . Among the 58 patients who 
 
discontinued from the TFR phase due to confirmed loss of MR4.0 or l oss of MMR, 5 6 patients restarted 
Tasigna  therapy and 2 patients permanently discontinued from the study.  
By [CONTACT_941] 96- week data cut -off, o f the 5 6 patients who restarted Tasigna  treatment due to confirmed loss of MR4.0 
or loss of MMR in the TFR phase, 52 pa tients (9 2.9%) regained MR4.0 and MR4.5; 4 patients ( 7.1%) did not 
regain MR4.0 by [CONTACT_825761]- off date.  The cumulative rate of MR4 and MR4.5 regained by 48- weeks 
since treatment re- initiation, was 92.9% (52/56 patients) and 91.1% (51/56 patients), respectively .

What is the most important information I should know about Tasigna?  
Tasigna can cause a possible life- threatening heart problem called QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation causes an 
irregular heartbeat, which may lead to sudden death.  
Your healthcare provider should check the electrical activity of your heart with a test called an electrocardiogram 
(ECG): 
• before starting Tasigna  
• 7 days after starting Tasigna • with an y dose changes  
• regularly during Tasigna treatment  
You may lower your chances for having QTc prolongation with Tasigna if you: 
• Take Tasigna on an empty stomach:  
○ Avoid eating food for at least [ADDRESS_1145130] 1 hour after the dose is taken.  
• Avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and any supplement containing grapefruit extract while taking Tasigna. Food and 
grapefruit products increase the amount of Tasigna in your body.  
• Avoid taking other medic ines or supplements with Tasigna that can also cause QTc prolongation.  
• Tasigna can interact with many medicines and supplements and increase your chance for serious and life- threatening 
side effects.  
• Do not take any other medicine while taking Tasigna unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay to do so.  
• If you cannot swallow Tasigna capsules whole, you may open the Tasigna capsule and sprinkle the contents of each 
capsule in 1 teaspoon of applesauce (puréed apple). Swallow the mixture right away (within 15 minutes). For more information, see “How should I take Tasigna?”  
Call your healthcare provider right away if you feel lightheaded, faint, or have an irregular heartbeat while taking 
Tasigna. These can be symptoms of QTc prolongation.  
What is Tasigna?  
Tasigna is a prescription medicine used to treat a type of leukemia called Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic 
myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in adults who:  
• are newly diagnosed,  or 
• are no longer benefiting from previous other treatments, i ncluding treatment with imatinib (Gleevec), or  
• have taken other treatments, including imatinib (Gleevec), and cannot tolerate them 
It is not known if Tasigna is safe and effective in children.  
Who should not take Tasigna?  
Do not take if you have:  
• low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood  
• long QTc syndrome  
Before taking Tasigna, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you :  
• have  heart problems  
• have had a stroke or other problems due to decreased blood flow to the brain  
• have problems with decreased blood flow to your legs  
• have irregular heartbeat  
• have QTc prolongation or a family history of it  
• have liver problems  
• have had pancreatitis  
• have low blood levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood  
• have a severe problem with lactose (milk sugar) or other sugars. Tasigna capsules contain lactose. Most people who 
have mild or moderate lactose intolerance can take Tasigna.  
• have bleeding problems  
• had a surgical procedure involving the removal of the entire stomach (total gastrectomy)  
•   are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Tasigna can harm your unborn baby.  Tell your healt hcare provider right 
away if you are pregnant, or if you become pregnant during treatment with Tasigna .  
 
In females who are able to become pregnant: 
o Your healthcare provider should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Tasigna.  
o Use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Tasigna and for at least [ADDRESS_1145131] 
dose.

during treatment and for at least [ADDRESS_1145132] dose of Tasigna.  
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, includin g prescription and over -the-counter medicines, 
vitamins and herbal supplements.  
If you need to take antacids (medicines to treat heartburn) do not take them at the same time that you take Tasigna. If you 
take:  
• a medicine to block the amount of acid prod uced in the stomach (H2 blocker): Take these medicines  about 10 
hours before you take Tasigna,  or about 2 hours after you take Tasigna.  
• an antacid that contains aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach: Take these medicines  about [ADDRESS_1145133] with many medicines and supplements and increase your chance for serious and life- threatening 
side effects.  See “What is the most important inf ormation I should know about Tasigna?”  
How should I take Tasigna?

• If you miss a dose, just take your next dose at your regular time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for 
a missed dose.  
• If you take too much Tasigna, call your healthcare provider or poison control center right away. Symptoms may include vomiting and drowsiness.  
• During treatment with Tasigna your healthcare provider will do tests to check for side effects and t o see how well 
Tasigna is working for you. The tests will check your:  
o heart  
o blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). Your blood cells should be checked every [ADDRESS_1145135] 2 months and then monthly.  
o electrolytes (potassium, magnesium)  
o pancreas and liver function  
o bone marrow samples  
Your healthcare provider may change your dose. Your healthcare provider may have you stop Tasigna for some time or 
lower your dose if you have side effects with it.  
• Your healthcare provider will monitor your CML during treatment with Tasigna to see if you are in a remission. After at 
least [ADDRESS_1145136] results, yo ur healthcare provider may decide if you may be eligible to try stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_825634]. This is called Treatment Free Remission (TFR).  
• Your healthcare provider will carefully monitor your CML during and after you stop taking Tasigna. Based you yo ur 
test results, your healthcare provider may need to re- start your Tasigna if your CML is no longer in remission.

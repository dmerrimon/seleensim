Confidential Page 14 of 64 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED) Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by [CONTACT_72068] (DEWS) as a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles (Craig et al, 2017). Symptoms of DED such as feeling of dryness, burning, a sandy/gritty sensation, foreign body sensation, pain or itchiness are quite debilitating. In addition, visual function related symptoms such as fluctuating vision with blinking, blurred vision, and difficulty with reading despi[INVESTIGATOR_459718]. In consequence, DED negatively impacts quality of life comparably to other severe diseases (Schiffmann et al. 2003), and adverse effects on mental health, such as depression and anxiety, have been observed (Le et al. 2012). DED is a serious and chronic disorder that, if left untreated or undertreated, progressively damages the ocular surface and may lead to permanent vision loss due to corneal complications (Lemp et al., 1995).  As many as 5 - 35% of subjects visiting ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, making it one of the most common conditions seen by [CONTACT_72070] (McCarty et al 1998; Lin et al 2003). Estimates of the prevalence of dry eye vary considerably, depending on the criteria used to define the disease, but in the [LOCATION_002] (US), it has been estimated that as many as 3.[ADDRESS_1077005] DED, with a projected 40% increase in the number of patients affected by 2030 (Schaumberg et al, 2002; Schaumberg et al, 2003; Schaumberg et al, 2009). With the aging population in the US and other countries of the developed world, and with increasing computer use, DED is expected to continue to become more prevalent and finding a treatment is becoming more important (Benitez-del Castillo et al. 2017).  2.[ADDRESS_1077006] consisting of 100% perfluorohexyloctane. NOV03 addresses DED associated with MGD via a new physicochemical mode of action. Due to its low surface tension it rapi[INVESTIGATOR_783266] a layer at the tear film air interface. Such a layer prevents excessive evaporation of the aqueous tear film component. In addition, NOV03 penetrates into the meibomian glands, where it potentially interacts with and dissolves the altered, viscous meibum secretion in the glands. As a water-free, single component product, it is free of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_657716], surfactants and preservatives. Related advantages include convenient handling, improved tolerability, and a decrease in the visual disturbance upon instillations. 
NOV03 (100% Perfluorohexyloctane) Sponsor: Bausch & Lomb, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol # NVU-[ADDRESS_1077007] Market Clinical Follow-up studies NT- 001, NT- 002, NT- 003 and NT- 004 with the perfluorohexyloctane containing medical device (NovaTears®), which showed that subjects with evaporative DED and MGD benefitted most. Clinical data from observational studies NT- 001 and NT- 002 consistently indicate that NOV03 is efficacious in treating signs and symptoms of mild to moderate evaporative DED and mild to moderate DED associated with MGD. Clinical study NT- 004 demonstrated that NOV03 increases tear film thickness (TFT) and lipid layer thickness (LLT) compared to saline solution and therefore provides further clinical evidence supportive for the use of NOV03 for evaporative forms of DED.  For the US development of NOV03, the phase 2 clinical trial NVU-002 (SEECASE-1) was conducted in US clinical sites. NVU-002 was designed to specifically include a DED population with an MGD component. In NVU-002, subjects improved clinically significantly from treatment with NOV03. The magnitude of symptom improvement was large (in the 50% range) for many of the VAS items in the NOV03 groups.  2.3 Trial Rationale For the US development of NOV03, a phase 2 trial NVU-002 (SEECASE-1) was conducted. NVU-[ADDRESS_1077008] of NOV03 at two different dosing regimens (QID and BID) on signs and symptoms of DED after 8 weeks treatment duration.  The trial showed efficacy of NOV03 in sign and symptom outcomes, in a highly symptomatic predominantly evaporative DED population with clinically significant MGD presence. It met its prespecified primary efficacy endpoint of superior change from baseline in tCFS at week 8 for both BID and QID dosing regimens compared to the combined saline control with high statistical significance. NOV03 showed clinically meaningful improvements in a variety of symptoms. The effects on Dryness Score, awareness of DED symptoms, and frequency of dryness were highly statistically significant over the combined dosing regimens of the saline control. Benefits in both signs and symptoms were dose-schedule-dependent favoring the QID schedule over the BID schedule. The treatment effects started early (2 weeks) and were maintained throughout the visits. NOV03 was safe and well tolerated after 8 weeks of BID or QID dosing. Results are planned to be confirmed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_783267]-003 (SEECASE-2), a randomized, double-masked, saline-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of NOV03 on signs and symptoms of Dry Eye Disease associated with Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. Subjects successfully completing NVU-003 will be offered to continue treatment in the phase 3, open-label extension trial NVU-004 (Kalahari OLE). NVU-004 is designed to gain information on long-term safety and tolerability of NOV03 QID dosing of subjects completing the 8-weeks treatment in trial NVU-003.

Approximately 200 subjects who completed the clinical trial NVU-003 and meet all other NVU-004 trial eligibility criteria will be included at approximately 20 clinical sites in the US to receive treatment with NOV03.  NVU-004 eligible subjects will dose the IMP (NOV03) ophthalmologically and bilaterally QID for approximately [ADDRESS_1077009]’s last clinic visit.  The end of the trial for the overall trial is defined as completion of the last visit or procedure as specified in schedule of assessments (Appendix 1) for all subjects in the trial.  4.[ADDRESS_1077010] be performed in the respective order as listed. IMP Dispensation is described in Section 7.1.4.  Subjects shall be instructed not to discuss IMP characteristics and/or their experience with the IMP with other subjects during each visit.

If NVU-003 and NVU-004 subjects are present at the clinical site the same time, the site should take precautions to prevent subjects from interacting. Day 1 (Visit 1) The results of assessments at Visit 4 (Day 57) in study NVU-003 (=final visit) will be taken as Day 1 data for NVU-004. Further data/assessments to be captured will be the NVU-004 Informed Consent, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to determine NVU-004 eligibility, Non-leading Adverse Event questioning (AE query) and IMP dispensation.  Subjects will be given a 4-bottle IMP supply and will self-administer a single drop of the trial medication into both eyes at the clinic. Each subject will be given a dosing diary to record the number of IMP doses taken daily. Study staff will remind the subject how to use the dosing diary and when the remaining doses should be taken. Visits 2-6 / (ET) Subjects will return to the clinic on week 4±2 days (Visit 2), week 12±7 days (Visit 3), week 26±7 days (Visit 4), week 40 ±7 days (Visit 5), week 52±7 days (Visit 6/Early Termination (ET)) to be evaluated for ocular and non-ocular adverse events and signs and symptoms of DED. IMP and the subject diary will be collected and reviewed. All used and unused trial medication should be returned to the clinic and a new trial medication kit will be dispensed.   The subject will be asked to complete an eyedrop comfort and acceptability questionnaire during Visit 6/ET. Subjects will be discharged from the trial after all Visit 6/ET assessments have been completed.  Telephone Calls (TC) Seven (7) telephone calls are scheduled at week 8±2 days (TC 1), week 16 ±7 days (TC 2), week 22 ±7 days (TC 3), week 30 ±7 days (TC 4), week 36 ±7 days (TC 5), week 44 ±7 days (TC 6), week 48 ±7 days (TC 7). During each telephone call the subjects will be interviewed using non-leading AE questioning and asked for medical and/or concomitant medication updates.  Early Termination Subjects who terminate early during the treatment period will be asked to complete all assessments as indicated at Visit 6 on the schedule of assessments prior to commencement of any alternative DED therapy (if considered possible). Dosing diary and trial medication will be collected. Subjects who are terminated early from the trial will not be replaced.

Confidential Page 18 of 64 4.4 Trial Flow  All subjects will be expected to progress from Visit 1 through trial exit at Visit 6 (week 52). All subjects will follow the trial structure with visits and telephone-calls (TC) as shown in Figure 1. Most Visit [ADDRESS_1077012] Visit (FSFV) until Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV) is expected to be approximately 18 months.  4.6 Justification of Trial Design This 52-week open-label extension trial will enroll subjects successfully completing trial NVU-003. The open-label single-arm treatment design is deemed adequate for investigating long-term safety/tolerability of NOV03 QID at regular intervals in at least 100 subjects in long term (52-week), day to day use. An interim analysis will be performed after 100 subjects complete 26-weeks of treatment. 4.7 Justification of Dose  NOV03 has demonstrated efficacy for signs and symptoms of DED in the phase 2 trial NVU-002 at two NOV03 dosing regimens (QID and BID) versus saline. In NVU-002 the NOV03 QID regimen showed more pronounced effects for several efficacy parameters

Confidential Page 19 of 64 compared to the NOV03 BID and saline regimens. Therefore, the NOV03 QID regimen was chosen for the phase 3 trial NVU-003 to replicate the 8-weeks efficacy and safety results of NVU-002.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the subject signature [CONTACT_783300].  AEs ongoing at the time of Visit 4 (Day 57) in trial NVU-[ADDRESS_1077039] and the investigator.  A clinically significant visual acuity worsening in NVU-004 (defined as an increase of 0.22 or greater in logMAR score) from Visit 0 in NVU-003 will be considered an Adverse Event.  Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, relationship to IMP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or symptom observed by [CONTACT_459740]-leading AE questioning.  AEs (both elicited and observed) will be monitored throughout the trial. The investigator will promptly review all AEs for accuracy and completeness. All AEs will be documented on the appropriate source document and eCRF.   9.1.1 Severity Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IMP or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: • Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with the subject’s daily activities. • Moderate: Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere with the subject’s daily activities. • Severe: Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
NOV03 (100% Perfluorohexyloctane) Sponsor: Bausch & Lomb, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol # NVU-[ADDRESS_1077040] The relationship of each AE to the investigational drug should be determined by [CONTACT_32981]: • Suspected: A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product caused the AE.  • Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational product caused the AE.  Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure (e.g. angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with IMP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IMP (e.g. tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the trial population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the IMP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  9.1.3 Expectedness The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about the IMP. The active ingredient of NOV03 is perfluorohexyloctane, which is a semifluorinated alkane with a well-established tolerability and safety profile. It has been tested in four PMCF studies and one phase 2 clinical trial up to now with >[ADDRESS_1077041] been listed in the Investigator’s Brochure. Therefore, the following definitions will be used:  • Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the investigator’s brochure in the Adverse Reaction Section at the specificity or severity that has been observed. • Expected: An AE that is listed in the investigator’s brochure in the Adverse Reaction Section at the specificity and severity that has been observed. The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is subject to the sponsor`s determination.  9.1.4 Outcome The outcome of any AE will be determined and recorded using the following categories:  • Recovered/Resolved • Recovering/Resolving • Not Recovered/Not Resolved

It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; o Note:  The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. o Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_608167]; • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; o Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g. hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). • A congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Medically important o Important Medical Events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by [CONTACT_783286], CRO and/or the sponsor in addition to that information reported on the case report form. All subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the outcome reported. The investigator must obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the subject; provide CRO Drug Safety Navigator and the trial sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IMP; and inform the IRB of the AE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs.

All SAE/S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be promptly reported to the IRB/IEC and governing health authorities (e.g. [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, and local regulations and timelines.  9.[ADDRESS_1077046]’s source document. Non-serious AEs identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_80697].   If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE (i.e. resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE Report Form must be completed and faxed to CRO Drug Safety Navigator within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the new information. The original SAE form is not to be altered, but a new SAE Report Form must be completed and identified consecutively based on the previous report form (i.e. Initial Report, Follow-up #1, Follow-up #2, etc.). The report must describe whether the event has resolved or continues and how the event was treated. 9.6 Reporting Pregnancies Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE (unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_783275] a contraceptive medication). Pregnancy is an important medical event that must be followed up. Any pregnancy that occurs during the clinical trial where the fetus could have been exposed to IMP must be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.

Confidential Page 51 of 64   Visual Acuity Procedures LogMAR Visual Acuity (VA) must be assessed using an ETDRS-like chart. The procedure used will be consistent with the recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye charts. Visual Acuity should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e. prior to slit-lamp examination). Subjects should use the most recent correction to attain their best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) during all VA assessments. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_783277]. Equipment The visual acuity chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. In ALL cases, for purposes of standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only ETDRS Series 2000 Chart 1 & 2, and the right eye (OD) should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, 

NOV03 (100% Perfluorohexyloctane) Sponsor: Bausch & Lomb, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol # NVU-[ADDRESS_1077062] viewing distance should be exactly 4 meters (13 feet). Measurement Technique The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The subject should attempt to read each letter, line-by-line, left to right, beginning with line [ADDRESS_1077063] reads a number, he/she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The subject should be asked to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response. If the subject changes a response (e.g. 'that was a "C" not an "O"') before he/she has read aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted. If the subject changes a response having read the next letter, then the change is not accepted. The examiner should never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test. A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject says he/she cannot read a letter, he/she should be encouraged to guess. If the subject identifies a letter as one of two letters, he/she should be asked to choose one letter and, if necessary, to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despi[INVESTIGATOR_537985], the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. LogMAR Visual Acuity Calculations The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as the base logMAR reading. To this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number of letters missed up to and including in the last line read. This total sum represents the logMAR visual acuity for that eye. For Example: Subject correctly reads 4 of 5 letters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 0.1 line. Base logMAR = 0.1 N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 and on line 0.1) = 4 N x T (T=0.02) = 0.08 Base logMAR + (N x T) = 0.1 + 0.08 logMAR VA = 0.18  Repeat the procedure for the left eye (OS). In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessments of visual acuity during the study, all visual acuity assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction cannot be used (i.e. a subject forgets his/her glasses), the reason for the change in correction should be documented. Note: A clinically significant visual acuity decrease (defined as an increase of 0.22 or greater in logMAR score) from Visit 0 (NVU-003) will be considered an Adverse Event.

Abnormal findings, which are clinically significant, will be described. The following will be examined at each visit: • Lids • Cornea  • Conjunctiva  • Anterior Chamber • Iris • Lens  External magnification and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit-lamp.  Magnification will be consistent with standard clinical practice. The subject will be seated for the assessment.  Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) The examiner will instill 5 µL of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. To thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film, the subject will be instructed to blink several times. The examiner should wait approximately 30 seconds after instillation before evaluating TFBUT.  With the aid of a slit-lamp, the examiner will monitor the integrity of the tear film, noting the time it takes to form micelles from the time that the eye is opened. TFBUT will be measured in seconds using a stopwatch for the right eye followed by [CONTACT_358503]. The two TFBUT values that are used to calculate the average will be entered into the eCRF.  For each eye, two measurements will be taken and averaged unless the two measurements are >2 seconds apart and are each <[ADDRESS_1077064] of the three would be averaged.

Fluorescein Staining  The examiner will instill 5 µL of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. Note, this is the same instillation as for TFBUT. To thoroughly mix the fluorescein with the tear film, the subject will be instructed to blink several times. The examiner should wait approximately 2-3 minutes after instillation before evaluating fluorescein staining. A Wratten #12 yellow filter will be used to enhance the ability to grade fluorescein staining. The staining will be graded with the NEI Grading Scale. Only the cornea will be graded. Digital images of fluorescein staining may be taken for digital analysis.

Confidential Page 54 of 64 NEI/Industry Workshop Scale For each eye, score each of the five areas of the cornea.  
  Diagram of the division of the corneal surface for measuring fluorescein uptake. A standardized grading system of 0-3 is used for each of the five areas on each cornea. Grade 0 will be specified when no staining is present. The maximum total score for each eye is 15.   Meibomian Gland Assessment (MGD score) Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is blockage or some other abnormality of the meibomian glands causing an insufficient secretion of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_783278]. This causes the tears to evaporate too quickly, and thus MGD is considered a leading cause of dry eye syndrome.  The Meibomian Gland Evaluator stick (Korb MGE®-Stick) with standardized force application will be used for this assessment. The Meibomian Gland Assessment (MGD Score) will be performed during the trial at Visits 1 (transferred from V4 of NVU-003), 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 or at an Early Termination Visit.   The secretion of 5 central glands on the lower eyelid will be evaluated for each eye. Each of the 5 glands will be scored from 0-3: 0 = normal, 1 = thick/yellow, whitish, particulate; 2 = paste; 3 = none/occluded. The total score will thus range from 0-15.  In the NVU-[ADDRESS_1077065]’s inclusion criteria, Meibomian Gland Dysfunction is defined as MGD score ≥ 3.

The test will be performed ≥5 minutes after MGD evaluation according to the following procedure: • Do not blot eyes prior to the test. • Using a sterile Schirmer test strip, a bend in the strip will be made in line with the notch in the strip. • The subject will be instructed to gaze up and in. • The Schirmer test strip will be placed in the lower temporal lid margin of each eye such that the strip fits tightly. Subjects will be instructed to close their eyes. • After [ADDRESS_1077066] elapsed, the Schirmer strip will be removed. The length of the moistened area will be recorded (mm) for each eye.  Procedure for Evaluating Intraocular Pressure Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured in each eye by [CONTACT_783293] 1 (transferred from V4 of NVU-003), 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, or at an Early Termination Visit. A single measurement will be made to obtain a determination of IOP. The same tonometer employing the investigator’s standard technique should be used throughout the trial. In addition, all reasonable efforts will be made to have the same examiner obtain all IOP measurements for a given subject.  Procedure for Conducting Dilated Fundoscopy A dilated fundoscopy exam will be performed during the trial at Visits 1 (transferred from V4 of NVU-003), 3, 4, 5 and 6 or at an Early Termination Visit. Observations will be graded as Normal or Abnormal. Abnormal findings will be described. The following will be examined: • Vitreous • Retina • Macula • Choroid • Optic Nerve

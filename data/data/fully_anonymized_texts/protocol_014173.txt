PREFACE  
CSP #465, “Glycemic Control and Complications in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2,” was a 
randomized unblinded clinical trial comparing tight glycemic control to standard glycemic control and was conducted at 20 VA medical centers. One thousand seven hundred and ninety one patie nts were randomized over the 2 ½  year accrual periods and then followed 
for an additional 5 years. Follow -up averaged between 5 and 7 years depending upon when 
the patient was enrolled in the study. Patients were see n on average every three months in 
the VA Outpatient Clinics. Hypertension and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_854585]. Education regarding diet, exercise, smoking cessation and management of hyper and hypo -glycemic reac tions was also provided. Data were 
collected throughout the study on the patients’ physical status, adverse and serious adverse events, concomitant medications, and study end points including mortality. The study was conducted under an FDA IND and consisted of broad use of all anti -diabetic 
treatments commercially available between 2000 and 2008 including oral medications 
and insulin. Study required medications and all study clinic visits were provided free of the usual VA co -pay. Active clinical follow -up of the sample end ed on May 31, 2008. 
With the end of the clinical trial the patients were  transitioned back to usual patient care 
services .  
It is important to clarify that with the completion of the active clinical trial and transitioning of patients to this observational trial, all responsibility for the care, treatment and 
oversight of the study patients became  the responsibility of the patients’ Primary Care 
Physician. The VA Diabetes Trial Follow -up Study (VADT -FS)is not collect ing adverse or 
serious a dverse events, is not required to file FDA reports or actively treat or have any 
“hands -on” care responsibility for the study participants.  
The ongoing VADT -FS consist s of centralized computer database searches and annual 
survey questionnaires related to quality of life and self -reported events pertinent to the 
CSP #465 study. 
The VADT -FS is very limited in scope compared to the clinical trial and is restricted to 
the activities stipulated in the proposal contained on the following pages.

VADT Follow -up Study (VADT -FS) 
Abstract:  
Diabetes affects nearly 1 in 10 Americans over the age of 45 and is associated with a 
doubling of mortality compared to age-adjusted controls, with about 75% of these deaths being due to cardiovascular (macrovascular) disease. Wit h the high life -time risk of 
hyperglycemia -related diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy (the so called 
“microvascular” complications of diabetes), there is a consensus that striving for tight glycemic control should be a high priority for individuals with early onset diabetes (i.e., onset before age 40 with a life expectancy of more than 20 years). However, there is considerable controversy over the importance of routine tight glycemic control in those with later onset disease, since these patie nts have a relatively low life- time risk of major 
microvascular complications but a very high risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Certainly, glycemic control, as measured by A1c, has been associated with an increased risk in macrovascular complica tions in many observational studies, however evidence from 
randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of intensive glycemic control in reducing macrovascular complications in those with type 2 diabetes is lacking. Therefore, for the majority of people with diabetes in the US (over age 50 without known microvascular complications), it remains controversial as to how much effort, cost, patient burden and exposure to unknown long -term complications of newer medications is justifiable in the 
pursuit of t ight glycemic control.  
Therefore, in 1999 the Veterans Administration Diabetes Trial (VADT) was funded, a randomized controlled trial designed to answer the question, “Does intensive glycemic management using the most effective hypoglycemic medications available result in decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.” The VADT was highly successful 
in recruiting and retaining study subjects and in implementing its study protocol. In 
particular, the VADT maintained a median A1c in the intensive therapy arm that has 
averaged 1.6 points lower than that in the conventional treatment group. The clinical trial ended  in May 2008. The main results of the VADT were presented at the American 
Diabetes Association Annual Scientific Meeting in June 2008 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2009. During the main trial, intensification of 
glycemic control did not reduce cardiovascular events implemented in people with excellent non-glycemic risk factor control. However, there is reason to beli eve that many of the 
macrovascular and microvascular complications potentially prevented by [CONTACT_941] 5 -8 years of 
good glycemic control achieved in the VADT will occur years after completion of the 
VADT experimental protocol. This could result in the initial results of the VADT  
providing an incomplete pi[INVESTIGATOR_854586]. In particular, the results of the [LOCATION_008] Prospective Diabetes Study ([LOCATION_006]PDS) follow -
up and EDIC study (the follow -up of the DCCT study population) make a compelling 
argument for continued follow-up of the VADT study population, in that they suggest that 
cumulative years of tight glycemic control may have a multiplicative effect on later CV risk 
(like compound interest). If this is true, then long -term follow -up would likely be necessary 
in order to fully appreciate the importance of intensive glycemic treatment. Therefore, the VADT study group propose d a longitudinal observational follow -up study of the VADT 
with the following objective: 1) to  determine the long term effects of intensive glycemic 
control in type 2 diabetes on major cardiovascular complications (primary outcome), and 2) to determine the long term effects of intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes on five secondary outcomes : a) cardiovascular mortality, b) major microvascular complications, 
c) health -related quality of life, d) total mortality , and e) major microvascular or

macrovascular ( end-stage renal disease, amputation for either ischemic or non- ischemic 
gangrene, CV- related death, or nonfatal MI, stroke, or new CHF ).This began in mid-[ADDRESS_1190135] on premature disability and mortality in the Western world (Camacho, 2000; CDC, 2005; Haffner, 1998; Ryerson, 2003). Diabetes affects nearly 1 in 10 Americans over the age of 45, is associated with a doubling of mortality compared to age-adjusted controls, and accounts for roughly 15% of all health care expenditures in the US (Druss, 2002; Hogan, 2003; Ryerson, 2003). Of the over [ADDRESS_1190136] 20% have diabetes (VA Achievements in Diabetes Care, VA Fact Sheet, February 2006; Miller, 2004).  In 
FY1998, the total cost of VA inpatient and outpatient use by [CONTACT_854624] $1.6 billion and VA patients with diabetes received 30% of all VA pharmacy prescriptions, accounting for approximately 28% of all pharmacy dollars expended, in FY2000 (Kupersmith, 2007; Miller, 2004; Maciejewski, 2004; Weinstein , 2004). The prevalence of diabetes (both diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) has also reportedly increased by [ADDRESS_1190137] 25 years, and the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_854587] (Honeycutt, 2003). Better understanding how to optimize care of diabetes is therefore one of the most important medical and public health priorities of today. Whether tight glycemic control reduces major cardiovascular complications is a critically 
important unanswered clinical question. There is a clear consensus that if tight glycemic control is shown to reduce major cardiovascular complications over a 15-year period, then health systems an d clinicians should prioritize achieving tight glycemic control in almost 
all patients with diabetes since 75% of people with diabetes die from cardiovascular disease (Vijan, 1997; Honeycutt, 2003; Engelgau, 2004). Microvascular complications of diabetes ( nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy), which are already known to be 
reduced by [CONTACT_854625], can be devastating as well, and there is strong evidence in type 1 diabetes and new onset type 2 diabetes that intensive glycemic control reduces  microvascular complications and may reduce long -term CV events. However, it 
has, as outlined in detail below, become quite clear that these results may not apply to today’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_145719] 2 diabetes patient, who is often older and has multiple comorbidities.  In particular, recent results from large randomized studies (including the Veterans Affairs 
Diabetes Trial ,VADT) in more advanced type [ADDRESS_1190138] 
microvascular benefit and no overall  CV benefit results from improved glyce mic control 
during the 3.5- 5 year  time frame of the studies. Therefore, the critical question of 
whether tight glycemic control (HbA1c < 7.0) reduces clinically relevant microvascular disease and CV events in patients receiving current day standard excell ent blood pressure 
and lipid management is only partially answered; and thus remains one of the most important clinical and public health questions of today.  What is clear from several early studies of glycemic control is that some of the most interesting  and important benefits resulting from improved glucose lowering on both 
macrovascular and, to a lesser extent, on microvascular outcomes have come long after the initial period of glycemic intervention, at a time when there was no longer any difference in  glycemic separation between study groups. This concept of vascular 
metabolic memory or the “legacy effect” is of critical importance in light of less impressive results in the shorter -term that were recently reported in The Action to Control

Cardiovascula r Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: 
Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) and the 
VADT.  Unfortunately, the important long-term findings from The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial ( DCCT) and The [LOCATION_008] Prospective Diabetes Trial 
([LOCATION_006]PDS) became apparent after the design and initiation of each of the more recent randomized trials - which were only 3.5-5.[ADDRESS_1190139] of a glycemic intervention which was aggressive yet relatively safe (as the ACCORD study increased mo rtality) and undertaken in people with advanced type [ADDRESS_1190140] we learned from controlled clinical trials?  
Most, but not all, observational studies have demonstrated that glycemic control is 
associated with reduced risk of both microvascular and CV complications (Selvin, 2004; Stratton, 2000; Adler, 1999; Haffner, 1998; Kirkman, 2006; Meigs, 1997; Reaven, 2005). As summarized below, evidence from randomized controlled trials on whether tight glycemic control results in a reduction of CV complications in those with diabetes is mixed at best.  
 The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)  
In this landmark trial of young people (age 13-39 years old at entry) with type 1 diabetes, good glycemic control led to impressive microvascular benefit with reduced albuminuria, 
retinopathy progression and neuropathy (DCCT, 1993). Although there was a trend towards improved CV outcomes, the number of events was small and there was no significant CV benefit during the course of the trial.  
 The [LOCATION_008] Prospective Diabetes Trial ([LOCATION_006]PDS) The [LOCATION_006]PDS, conducted in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with an average age 53, found a small but not statistically significant decrease in cardiovascular outc omes over a 
9-10 year period in the overall treated vs. control group.  However, a smaller subset of more overweight subjects treated with metformin did demonstrate a significant reduction in CV events ([LOCATION_006]PDS, 1998a, [LOCATION_006]PDS, 1998b).   The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE)  
Similar to the [LOCATION_006]PDS, more recent trials in type [ADDRESS_1190141] and intensive groups. While the [LOCATION_006]PDS involved individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes, VADT patients 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.1

had an average duration of diabetes of 11.5 years at entry; ACCORD, 10 years; and 
ADVANCE, 8 years. All participants had either prevalent CV or substantial CV risk at entry. The VADT (median follow-up 5.6 years), ACCORD (median follow-up 3.4 years), 
and ADVANCE (median follow-up 5 years) showed no cardiovascular benefit of more intensive glycemic control (Duckworth, 2009; ACCORD Study Group, 2008; ADVANCE Collaborative Group, 2008). In fact, the glycemic arm of ACCORD was stopped 18 months early because the intensive glycemic control arm, which achieved an A1c of 6.4%, was associated with a 22% increase in all cause mortality and a 35% increase in cardiovascular mortality (ACCORD Study Group, 2008).  Publication of these [ADDRESS_1190142] benefits of glycemic 
control on myocardial infarction, but not on stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all- cause 
mortality (Turnbull, 2009; Ray, 2009; Montori, 2009). A fourth recently published meta-analysis reached essentially the same conclusion (Boussageon, 2011). Probably because of the increased mortality risk of very aggressive control seen in ACCORD, one of the meta -analyses concluded that "…the possibility of harm with more- intensive glycaemic 
treatment cannot be ruled out." (Turnbull, 2009). Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of intensive glycemic control in people with type [ADDRESS_1190143]-trial observation of patients who had been in controlled clinical trials?  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_854588] t he interventional phase of the trials, long 
term observational follow -up studies have provided a substantially different, and more 
complex understanding of improved glycemic control and CV complications, at least in type 1 and earlier stages of type 2 diabetes.  
 
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epi[INVESTIGATOR_226081] (DCCT/EDIC)  
The DCCT/EDIC study was an observational follow-up study of the DCCT, in which type 1 diabetes participants continued to be carefully m onitored for diabetes complications 
after completion of the active intervention trial phase was completed.  During this follow-up phase, A1c levels in both treatment groups approached each other and were not significantly different throughout the follow-up period.  Thus, the extended follow-up was 
largely monitoring development of complications resulting from the prior reductions in 
glycemia. The main long -term study results were published when mean total follow-up 
(including the active trial phase) was ~17  years, and showed that the intensive glycemic 
group had a 42% reduction in CV events (Nathan, 2005). It is important to note that no statistically significant CV benefit was seen during the 6.[ADDRESS_1190144], this was not the case, but instead, emergence of benefit was delayed. This long-term benefit due to previous intensive glycemic therapy is often referred to as “metabolic memory”.  
The [LOCATION_008] Prospective Diabetes Trial ([LOCATION_006]PDS) As in the follow-up of type 1 diabetes patients, data from a 10 year observational follow-up of the type 2 diabetes [LOCATION_006]PDS cohort also revealed delayed benefits of improved glycemic control (Holman, 2008). These benefits, as in the DCCT/EDIC occurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_854589] A1c levels in both groups following completion of the active trial phase. 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190145]- trial follow -
up, respectively. These important findings suggested that the phenomenon of "metabolic memory" is seen in type [ADDRESS_1190146]/EDIC, if there had not been a long term post-trial observational period in the UPKDS, the conclusion would have been that good glycemic control had no clear CV benefit. In fact, this was not the case since there was a substantial benefit, but again, its emergence was delayed.  
 Why is long term observational follow -up of the VADT cohort crucial?  
The lessons of the DCCT/EDIC and the [LOCATION_006]PDS follow-up studies are that some of the most important findings come long after the initial intervention. The important CV benefits of glycemic control in type [ADDRESS_1190147]/EDIC were seen after about 17 years of follow -up (including 12 years after the end of the intervention trial).  The 
important CV benefits of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes in the [LOCATION_006]PDS Follow-up were seen after about 20 years of follow-up (including 10 years after the end of intervention). Observational periods need to be long, or incomplete, indeed erroneous, conclusions can be reached. The practical implications are enormous. The major killer of people with type 2 diabetes is CV disease. Intensive glycemic control is expensive, increases risk for hypoglycemia and r equires substantially more effort on the part of the 
patient and the physician than non- glycemic pharmacologic prevention/treatment of CV 
disease. Therefore, extended follow -up of the VADT cohort is crucial since it will answer 
whether or not the very larg e human and financial investment in attaining meticulous 
glycemic control to an A1c < 7% actually reduces vascular outcomes over the long- term 
in patients with advanced type [ADDRESS_1190148]/EDIC and [LOCATION_006]PDS Follow-up Studies has shown this is not long enough. Indeed, because of inherent delay in data capture in several national d atabases, our [ADDRESS_1190149] an ~ 1.[ADDRESS_1190150]/EDIC studied young participants with type [ADDRESS_1190151], the [LOCATION_006]PDS was conducted in newly diagnosed type 2 individuals with little CV disease; while the 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.1

July 6, 2017
VADT enrolled people with diabetes diagnosed on average 11.5 years previously and 
with prevalent CV disease or substantial CV risk factors. Second, the A1c separation between intensive and control groups (1.5%) was nearly twice as large in the VADT compared to the [LOCATION_006]PDS (0.9%) on average. Moreover, the glycemic separation in the 
VADT was achieved within 6 months and maintained for the duration of the study. In the [LOCATION_006]PDS, A1c levels in the “intensive” treatment arm rose steadily throughout the study and had reached an A1c of about 8-8.2 % by [CONTACT_854626]. Third, in contrast to [LOCATION_006]PDS, both treatment groups in VADT maintained mean LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure levels below the target levels of the American Diabetes Association. The [LOCATION_006]PDS patients had less than optimal lipid control (LDL-C about 127 mg %) and, arguably, less than optimal systolic blood pressure (~ 137 mmHg) (Holman, 2008). This will allow the VADT Follow-up to answer a question which the [LOCATION_006]PDS could not answer, namely whether or not, over a prolonged post-trial observation period intensive glycemic control produces benefits beyond that achieved by [CONTACT_854627] (Duckworth, 2006; Duckworth, 2009: Meyers, 2006; Riche, 2007). Fourth, the [LOCATION_006]PDS was predominantly a study of monotherapy, without the use of modern glycemic treatment regimens, such as combination therapy with glitizones.  
The ACCORD study group is also conducting a follow-up study, but this does not render the VADT -FS unnecessary. Indeed, the results from these two follow- up studies will 
undoubtedly be complementary and provide a more complete understanding of the long-term effects of improved glycemic control. Although study participants were relatively similar in age, duration of diabetes and CV risk, there were substantial differences in study design and conduct.  Within the VADT, A1c separation was greater than in ACCORD (1.5% difference versus 1.1%) and occurred over different A1c ranges. In ACCORD, the standard group achieved a median A1c of 7.5%; the intensive group, 6.4%. In the VADT, the standard group achieved a median A1c of 8.4%; the intensive, 6.9%. The VADT trial was longer (5.6 years) than the glycemic arm of ACCORD (3.4 years). While there was excellent and essentially identical non -glycemic risk factor management 
in VADT, the ACCORD study, by [CONTACT_8345], was a multifaceted trial which also compared blood pressure target levels and lipid control strategies.  Finally, while the long term data from ACCORD will be extremely interesting and important, it is unlikely that the 
ACCORD protocol will ever be recommended for use in practice given its significant 22% increase in all -cause mortality found in short- term follow -up. Thus, the VADT 
Follow-up Study is the only study in progress that can provide critical informatio n on 
long-term CV effects (or lack of them) of an aggressive, but reasonably safe, glycemic 
intervention in those with advanced diabetes. 
 
Microvascular Outcomes  
 
Although the primary outcome assessed in this application has been, and will continue to 
be, a composite of cardiovascular outcomes, a secondary outcome includes microvascular disease, so it is appropriate to consider that as well.  
What have we learned from controlled clinical trials?  
Follow- up of the VADT cohort will also permit assessment of long term impact on 
glycemic control on microvascular endpoints, for which there is limited randomized controlled trial data. Diabetes is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, renal failure and amputation in adults in the US, and each of these microva scular complications are 
strongly associated with poor glycemic control (CDC, 2005).  Randomized controlled 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190152] produced grade A evidence that improved 
glycemic control reduces onset of early microvascular findings (such as new retinopathy and proteinuria) and progression from early to moderate disease (e.g., progression from background retinopathy to requiring retinal phot ocoagulation [laser therapy]) ( DCCT 
Research Group, 1993; [LOCATION_006]PDS Study Group, 1998a; Duckworth, 2009; ACCORD Eye Study Group, 2010). This is supported by [CONTACT_854628], but not all, older, smaller trials from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, the Kroc Foundation and by [CONTACT_854629] (VACSDM), the feasibility trial for the VADT (Kroc Collaborative Study Group, 1984; Dahl-Jorgensen, 1988; Feldt-Rasmussen, 1991; Reichard, 1993; Shichiri, 2000; Levin, 2000; Beulens, 2009). Although the [LOCATION_006]PDS found a statistically significant reduction in the need for retinal photocoagulation,  no randomized clinical trial has reported any improvement in patient function (such as vision, pain or health- related quality of life), end -stage events (such as end -stage renal 
disease or amputations) or diabetes -related mortality over 8 months t o10 years  (Kroc 
Collaborative Study Group, 1984; Dahl-Jorgensen, 1988; Feldt-Rasmussen, 1991; Reichard, 1993; DCCT Research Group, 1993; [LOCATION_006]PDS Study Group, 1998a; Shichiri, 2000; Levin, 2000; Duckworth, 2009; ACCORD Eye Study Group, 2010). Demonstrating improvements in these clinically relevant outcomes however is the most important measure of the value of improved glucose control. However, progression of microvascular complications to clinical endpoints is slow and as with CV disease, long- term follow -up is 
essential to firmly establishing a causal link. Unfortunately, as noted above, the VADT, ACCORD and ADVANCE study durations were only 3.[ADDRESS_1190153] -trial observation of patients who had been in 
controlled clinical trials?  
 
The extraordinary importance of long term follow-up to determine benefits of glucose 
lowering on microvascular complications is well illustrated by [CONTACT_333054]/EDIC study. While there was an effect of blood glucose improvement on a surrogate renal outcome (proteinuria) in DCCT, there was no demonstrable benefit on a hard outcome like glomerular filtration. However, the DCCT/EDIC did demonstrate that those individ uals 
who had had good control during the DCCT had kidney protection at 17 years of follow-up, a dozen years after the interventional trial ended, evidenced by [CONTACT_854630] > 2 mg/dl (Nathan, 2005). It is also important to note that no har d renal 
endpoint benefit was noted in an earlier EDIC/DCCT publication, with a four year post-
trial observation period, so it takes substantial time for this to emerge (DCCT/EDIC Research Group, 2000).    To our knowledge, there is very little other clinic al trial data on long term impact of 
glycemic control on hard microvascular endpoints. The [LOCATION_006]PDS reported a sustained benefit on a composite microvascular endpoint, but this was solely due to a reduction in retinal photocoagulation  (Holman, 2008). Although this outcome may establish the physiological effects of glycemic control, retinal photocoagulation is a low-risk outpatient procedure and most patients who undergo appropriately timed photocoagulation do not have diabetes -related short -term visual impair ment. Furthermore, retinal photocoagulation 
was not a pre-specified outcome in the original [LOCATION_006]PDS protocol. Finally, the VADT had much better blood pressure control than the [LOCATION_006]PDS.   Since improved blood pressure 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190154]/EDIC and the lack of other clear clinical trial hard endpoint data in those with type 2 diabetes will make the VADT Follow-up even more valuable.  
Objectives  
CSP #465-F is an observational follow-up study of the surviving VADT cohort (the 
VADT -FS), which has two major objectives:

Study Subjects. 
VADT Recruitment & Baseline Information: To be eligible for the VADT, subjects had to 
be over [ADDRESS_1190155] type 2 diabetes and be non- responsive (A1c > 7.5%) to a 
maximum daily dose of one or more oral agents or on insulin. Any of the following 
conditions resulted in exclusion of the patient from enrollment in the VADT: 
● angina pectoris, Canadian Class I -II 
● congestive heart failure, Class III -IV 
● stroke, incapacitating or in last 6 months 
● AMI or invasive cardiovascular procedure within the past six months,  
● ongoing diabetic gangrene,  
● BMI > 40, 
● hemoglobinopathy that interferes with A1c monitoring, 
● serum creatinine > 1.6 mg/dL, 
● fasting C -peptide < 0.21 pmol/ml, 
● ALT > 3 times normal or serum bilirubin > 1.9 mg/dL, 
● malignancy or noncardiac li fe-threatening diseases making life expectancy < 5 years,  
● autonomic neuropathy, 
● symptomatic pancreatic insufficiency (endocrine or exocrine),

● recurrent seizures within the past year,  
● hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297],  
● pregnancy, lactation, or planning a pregnancy, 
● active ps ychosis or substance abuse, 
● lack of access to a person who can assist or be called in an emergency,  
● underlying conditions that in the site PI’s judgment may prevent adherence to 
protocol, 
● current participation in another clinical trial.  
Almost 18,[ADDRESS_1190156] common 
reasons for exclusion were A1c < 7.5% (34%), not on insulin or a maximum dose of an 
oral agent (16%), unwilling to participate (12%), renal insufficiency (8%), PI [INVESTIGATOR_854590] (5%, with the most common reasons given being patient lives too far away, has multiple com orbid conditions, or has history of frequent no-shows), and BMI>

The VA Ann Arbor IRB granted a “HIPAA waiver” in July 2011 that permits determination of cause of death using National Death Index data using a special analytic protocol that protects patient anonymity. Investigators at the Ann Arbor VA HSR&D are very experienced in conducting such analyses. Per 
IRB protocol, these analyses will be conducted in a fully blinded fashion (ie, the data manager accessing the follow -up mortality information will merge this 
information to the VADT unique ID, but will not have access to the VADT dataset itself, and the investigators and data analyst will not have access to subject’s true identity or treatment arm. Below, we refer to this cohort as the “VADT -FS 
Mortality Analysis Cohort” to distinguish  it from the Main Cohort. VA Ann Arbor 
HSR&D will send the data to Hines CSPCC in a secure way following VA regulations for the interim and final analyses.

CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190158] Follow-up: 
Detailed information on the VADT protocol can be found in the main manuscript 
published in January, 2009, in the New England Journal of Medicine ( Abraria et al., 
2009) , however, here we include some background and key aspects relevant to the 
VADT -FS. The VADT was designed to do the best job possible of isolating the effects of 
hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. In order for the study to address different levels of glycemic control, and minimize potential medication specific effects, the protocol strove for both treatment groups to receive near-equal distribution of therapeutic classes (insulin segretagogues and sensitizers, exogenous insulin) with ultimately, the main difference betw een treatments  arms expected to be related to the dose of insulin. In 
addition, the VADT protocol tried to achieve optimal management of all other CV risk factors in both intervention and control patients to answer the question, “What is the incremental be nefit of intensive glycemic control once blood pressure, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_854591].  
The success of the VADT protocol in achieving the above goals has been impressive and is a tribute to the hard work and dedication of the VADT site investigators, and especially, the nurse coordinators. The VADT achieved and has maintained substantial A1c separation since year 1 1/2 of the trial (averaging a 1.5 point A1c median separation, with the A1c being 6.9in the intensive arm and 8.4% in the standar d treatment 
arm. 
The goal of complete matching of the standard and intensive arm subjects with respect to the number of hypoglycemic medications has not been completely achieved. However, the two groups are much more similar in this regard than might be expected given the 1arge A1c separation. In year [ADDRESS_1190159] of this difference is due to a higher use in the intensive arm of g limepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956] (Amaryl) 
(45% vs. 5 8%), rosiglitazone (Avandia)(54% vs. 66%), and precose (Acarbose)(2% vs. 15%). In year five of the study, 75% of standard therapy patients were on insulin compared to 88% of the intensive therapy patients (Duckworth et al., 2009 ).  
Treatment of CV risk factors in the VADT has been superb in both treatment arms as per protocol. For example, in year 5 of follow -up, 95% of patients were on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_854592] -platelet/anti- coagulant, 84% were on a statin, and the mean blood pressure was 
126/70mmHg. Each of the above have been achieved almost identically in the standard and intensive therapy arms. With regard to lipid levels, in year five the VADT study population had a mean LDL cholesterol of 84mg/dL ±29 and a median of 77m g/dL, with 
almost 80% of the study population having levels < 1 00mg/dL. Intolerance of statin therapy was the main reason for not achieving an LDL < 100mg/dL(Duckworth et al., 2009 . 
 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190160] stopped. Due to little 
local study activity and/or regulatory issues at the local sites, five of the twenty sites were prematurely closed. For similar reasons, other sites are considering closing in the future. A sixth site was suspended (due to issues having nothing to do with the VADT or the VADT -FS). In order to prevent losing the consented patients at these sites  and for the 
smooth continuation of the currently consented patients, several strategies were planned  
and have been undertaken. These are under the direction of the follow -up study’s new Co-
Chair men at the Hines and Phoenix VAMCs and the two national coordinating centers, Ann 
Arbor VA HSR&D (AA HSR&D) Center of Excellence and The Hines VA Cooperative 
Studies Program Coordinating Center (Hines CSPCC) as follows.   Currently, there are three groups of patients. Group #1 consists of those VADT patients who consented to participate in VADT- FS but who are at sites where the VADT -FS has 
been closed.  Group #2 consists of those VADT patients who consented to participate in VADT -FS and who are at sites whe re the VADT -FS is still open.  Group #3 consists of 
individuals who were in VADT, but never consented to the VADT- FS. The requested 
process for each group would be different. 
 Group #[ADDRESS_1190161] the informed consent process handled centrally by [CONTACT_854631] (who will be located at Hines); Hines would also become the sole IRB for the VADT -FS.  
 The process would be as follows:  
1.    National s tudy staff at Hines will obtain participant contact [CONTACT_854632]&D and the Hines CSPCC.   
2. National study staff  will mail a cover letter  addressing local site closure and the 
informed consent form s (including  HIPAA ) to all patients at closed sites whose 
initial consent forms are no longer valid. The cover letter would explain that the study was closed at their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], but that oversight would be transferred to Hines, and inviting them to continue participation. The complete cons ent 
form would have this change (i.e, transfer of oversight to Hines IRB) 
highlighted. 
3. Seven  to fourteen  days after the mailing, the National study  staff will attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_854633] #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190162] will be considered 
passive refusals for re- entry into the study.  
A second approach would be to work with formerly local PIs at closed sites to re-open 
those sites and consent patients locally. Those patients would then be transferred to the supervision of the Hines IRB, as described under Group #2, below. 
 
Group #2 For this second group, those VADT patients who consented to participate in VADT-
FS and who are at sites where the VADT -FS is still open, we plan to transfer oversight 
to the Hines IRB which would become the sole IRB for the VADT -FS.  
 The process would be as follows: 
 1. National study staff  at Hines will obtain contact [CONTACT_854634]&D and the Hines CSPCC.   
2. National  staff will mail an explanatory and “opt-out” letter to all VADT -FS 
participants  at open sites. The letter  would explain that the study was continuing 
unchanged except that oversight would be transferred to Hines. It would give them an opportunity to opt-out of further participation, should they choose not to be “transferred”.  
3. If the subjects do not respond tw o weeks after the initial mailing, they will be mailed 
the letters again.  
4. After the second mailing and no response in two  weeks, the subjects are considered 
enrolled under the oversight of the Hines IRB since they have had the opportunity to opt out and did not do so.  
5. Then local sites can be closed out with instructions from the Project Manager.  
 
 
 
Group #[ADDRESS_1190163]  group, those VADT patients who had never previously consented to 
participate in VADT -FS and who are at sites where the VADT -FS is still open, we 
plan to recruit potential participants in a non -targeted fashion and subsequently 
transfer oversight to the Hines IRB (as with group #2) which would again become the sole IRB for the se VADT -FS participants .  
 1. Local staff would use non- targeted rec ruitment approaches similar to a newspaper 
or flyer advertisement that are consistent with  Hines  IRB policy. These flyers, ads 
or information sheets would include contact [CONTACT_854635]- FS study.  
2. Once consented, these subjects would fall into Group #2 category and would be handled in a similar fashion as that group.

CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190164] the National Co -Chair’s Office 
with questions.  
 
Therefore, in the consent process we ask permission for conducting an annual survey and 
allowing the research team to follow their future health care and outcomes using a variety 
of data sources, including inspection of their VA and non- VA me dical records, data from 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and VA and US death records (see 
Data Collection section below). We inform them that they will receive a small payment of a 
$[ADDRESS_1190165] is  asked to assign a surrogate authorized to report vital status or health 
events (and provide a release of information) if the study subject is unable to do so. Of 
course, subjects are also informed that participation in the VADT -FS is completely 
voluntary and that they can revoke their consent at any point in the future. 
We cannot be certain what will happen to the risk factor management of the VADT cohort once they return to routine VA primary care. If the previous experience of the DCCT -EDIC (Nathan, 2005) and the [LOCATION_006]PDS Cohort hold true, then eventually both arms 
may converge toward a median A1c of about 7.8 – 8.0%. We suspect that the two study arms will have excellent and similar CV risk factor management during the observational follow-up period. Blood pressure and LDL l evels are currently comparable in the two 
study arms, and based upon current VA-wide levels, we expect that blood pressure and LDL will remain generally well controlled during follow -up, at least compared to 
national averages.(Kerr, 2004; Asch, 2004; Kuper smith, 2007; Saydah, 2004) 
VADT -FS Retention and Completion of Follow- Up 
Consented VADT -FS study subjects will be followed until the end of the study unless 
they withdraw their consent. The VADT -FS will also utilize several techniques to 
maximize a high le vel of study subject retention. For example, subjects who do not 
respond to the [ADDRESS_1190166] over the next 10 years.  
 
Data Collection Sources: 
In order to ensure the integrity of the data  a new unique ID number has been  assigned to all 
patients involved in the VADT -FS. The unique ID consist s of a five -digit number 
randomly assigned and has no reference to the original study ID or study site. The Hines 
CSPCC retain s the cross -link between the Long Term Follow-up ID and the CSP #465 
Study ID.

a) Self Report. All consenting subjects have been  given a toll free number and a return 
prepaid envelope to use to notify the Clinical Data Collection Center in Ann Arbor when 
any of  the following  occurs : 1. self -reported health status, 2. occurrence of study end- points 
(see below), and 3. outpatient visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365500], including whether this care was provided inside or outside of VHA (names of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854593]-VA inpatient care or procedures were received in the 
prior year in those not Medicare eligible (age <65). The initial mailed survey instrument is 
accompanied by a $[ADDRESS_1190167], and we will follow the modified -Dillman pr otocol thereafter 
(Dillman, 2007). A thank -you/reminder letter will be sent within [ADDRESS_1190168] not responded to the earlier mailings. Address information will be updated continuously during the trial; the main source of new address information will be the U.S. 
post-office. The addresses will be stored and updated by [CONTACT_854636]&D 
via an electronic database behind the VA firewall (SharePoint). Access to this database will 
be limited to study personnel at each site that have a need to know. At [ADDRESS_1190169] 
period.  
Updates  
The survey response rate was 83.6% in 2009, 81.2% in 2010, and 82.[ADDRESS_1190170] VADT -FS 
patients  will continue to get the majority of their care within VHA. In addition to VA’s current 
central inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and lab data repositories, newer data sources such as the Corporate Data Warehouse and National Diabetes Cube are expected to s erve as a source for other 
important clinical information such as blood pressure. 
We have obtain ed signed informed consent from  most of the  study subjects for access to their 
EMR during the informed consent process. We will continue to attempt to consent those who, 
for whatever reason, did not consent in the first place, we may have to re -consent those at sites 
where the VADT -FS has closed unless the site can be re- opened (see above). The Data 
Coordinating Center at Hines will be in charge of accessing information from the VA’s central 
data repositories every 6 months (such as the Medical SAS datasets at Austin, which 
contain inpatient and outpatient data, and the DSS lab and pharmacy National Data 
Extracts). The Data Collection Center in Ann Arbor will be in charge of obtaining medical record information on selected patients with potential primary endpoints for adjudication by [CONTACT_854637]. Both Hines and Ann Arbor have extensive experience with these respective activities in their past work, and h ave approved procedures for high- level data 
security. The VA diabetes registry and VA -CDC TRIAD study (which were collected and 
administered by [CONTACT_854638]) revealed a 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.1

substantial portion of VA patients get the ir eye care, emergency care (such as heart attacks and 
strokes) and some elective procedures outside of VHA, requiring us to not rely solely on VA 
information systems, which is why we plan to collect information on non- VA events and obtain 
non-VA medical r ecords for those reporting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854594]- fatal primary 
endpoints for those patients younger than 65 (CMS data will be used for those> 65). 
 
Updates  
Our survey results have found that 92% of VADT -FS patients report getting the 
majority of  their care within VHA and out-of- VA use has been much less than 
anticipated, thereby [CONTACT_854639]. Previous estimates were based on results found in the typi[INVESTIGATOR_854595], whereas , the VADT appears to have recruited a sample with less 
dual-use. In the first 3 years of the VADT-FS, of the 54 self-reported new study end-points requiring adjudication (MI, stroke, CHF or amputation by [CONTACT_854640]) only [ADDRESS_1190171] had 100% success rate in obtaining non-VA records to date.  
The Ann Arbor Center has IRB and VA CO permission to access the electronic 
medical record of VADT subjects at all study sites, so transfer of VA records to the Ann Arbor is unnecessary. This has greatly improved the efficiency and completeness of records available for review and adjudication. Although the process of obtaining records from non- VA facilities is very time consuming, the 
number of records that we need to obtain has been less than anticipated. In the first 2 years of the VADT -FS only 15 of the 130 (11.5%) self- reported new study end -
points (MI, stroke, CHF or amputation by [CONTACT_453053]) have required obtaining outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  This and utilizing remote electronic access to VA EMR records has allowed for some reductions in the budget, particularly important in a time of increasing budget constraints.  
c) Medicare data: Most subjects upon VADT completion were eligible for Medicare. By 
[CONTACT_854641], data on use of Medicare resources for medical services 
and records are available through the VIREC located at the Hines VA. VADT -FS 
investigators at the Clinical Data Collection Coordinating Center in Ann Arbor have previously w orked with this database, which provides fairly comprehensive information 
on inpatient and outpatient utilization, diagnoses, procedures and outcomes for those veterans 65 years or older. Approval to access this information is  included in the informed 
cons ent process. There was one caveat however 
− there was currently a hold on release 
of CMS information to VA investigators, due to a recent highly publicized data breech. It was a temporary situation, and that permission to access these data will be granted as it 
has been in our past studies. Howeve r, if access to CMS data on the subset of patients age 
[ADDRESS_1190172] 2.5 years of the 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190173] research has demonstrated that the combined Medicare/VA dataset is very accurate for major outcomes (Petersen 1999; Kiyota 2004), and we will use these 
data to identify subjects inside and outside of VA who have heart attacks, strokes, amputations, CHF admissions and dialysis based on diagnosis (ICD-9 codes) and procedure codes (CPT codes). 70.1% of VADT- FS subjects will be ag ed 65 or 
older at the beginning of this renewal, June 2012. 
d) Mortality records. Mortality data will be obtained from the VA Vital Status files, 
which combine death dates from all sources currently available to VA researchers, including the Medical SAS Inpat ient Datasets, the Veterans Benefits Administration’s 
(VBA) Beneficiary Identification and Resource Locator System (BIRLS), the Medicare Vital Status file,  National Death Index (NDI)  and the Social Security Administration (SSA) 
death file. Since the Vital Status file contains Medicare data, as noted above, it is no w 
currently available for research purposes . However, if the Vital Status file is not available 
in a timely fashion we will obtain mortality information from other accessible VA data 
sources inclu ding BIRLS, the Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets and the SSA death file. 
BIRLS, which is a primary data source for death information, contains approximately 10.7 million records and has an estimated 94.5% to 96.5% sensitivity (Fisher, 1995). A review of majo r US mortality databases found that the BIRLS -Death File had a high accuracy rate 
(Dominitz, 2001) and compares favorably with other national mortality databases. For classification of cause of death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854596] (since cardiovascular 
death is a primary study end-point). 
Update  
In addition to Medicare data (see above), we are now obtaining data on fatal cardiovascular events from the NDI, which is maintained by  [CONTACT_854642]. The Serious Mental Illness Treatment Resource and Evaluation Center (SMITREC), a 
unit housed within Ann Arbor’s COE HSR&D, maintains NDI data on all VHA 
users nat ionwide. The Ann Arbor Coordinating Center has an existing agreement 
with SMITREC to acquire the NDI information for our sample without charge. At present, SMITREC has NDI data available up until December [ADDRESS_1190174] 1 year additional follow- up for total mortality than we will hav e 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.1
18
July 6, 2017
for disease -specific mortality. Therefore total mortality will be obtained from the 
VA Vital Status files, which combine death dates from all sources currently 
available to VA researchers, including the Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets, the Veterans Benefi ts Administration’s (VBA) Beneficiary Identification and 
Resource Locator System (BIRLS), the Medicare Vital Status file, and the Social Security Administration (SSA) death file. A review of major US mortality databases found that these sources are quite accurate for mortality (Dominitz, 2001). 
Measuring Endpoints: 
The following endpoints will always be adjudicated: 1) non- fatal cardiac- related 
admissions to non -VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854597] 
(those <65 years old who r eport such events on the survey), and 2) all amputations (to 
determine if the amputation was ischemic [a primary endpoint], non- ischemic gangrene 
[a secondary endpoint] or traumatic [neither a primary nor secondary endpoint]). Death 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854598] (using central VA data) and CMS data will be used to capture events at non -VA facilities for 
over 65. Past experience has shown that discharge diagnosis for MI and stroke are highly accurate that the patient has truly had these events, and therefore such designations are 
generally relied upon in observational studies. This of course is not done in experimental studies in which investigators in the field may bias endpoint determination, a concern that does not exist in this observational follow-up study with central data collection.  
 When endpoint assessment and adjudication is needed, this will be conducted by [CONTACT_854643].  (Goldman, 2006) The Endpoints Committee will be comprised 
of a four person team to include two cardiologists, a neurologist, and a vascular surgeon, each of whom will be masked to subject’s previous treatment assignment in 
VADT. There  will be no changes from the VADT protocol in the process for adjudicating 
primary endpoints, but some “softer” endpoints will be dropped from the primary composite outcome (see below). As per the current end- point evaluation process, all reported 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149993], deaths or new symptoms or diagnoses that are even remotely suggestive of a 
primary endpoint, will have summary clinical information prepared for review by [CONTACT_854644]. These clinical summaries of potential study end points will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_854645], under the direction of 
Rod Hayward, MD and Sarah Krein, PhD, RN. All Ann Arbor personnel and the Endpoints Committee will be blinded as to the subjects’ previous randomized treatment status.  Data 
sources for identification of potential end -points can be detected by [CONTACT_18654] -report, by [CONTACT_854646], or through death indices. The clinical summary information will be reviewed by [CONTACT_854647], who can render a decision or request additional information. 
Endpoints that will be collected include: 
(1) Mortality: categorized as, a) deaths secondary to cardiovascular disease including 
sudden death not otherwise explained, b) deaths secondary to neoplasm, c) de aths 
secondary to other causes, d) undetermined. 
(2) Major cardiac event s: categorized as, a) acute myocardial infarction resulting in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], b) stroke, c) new onset congestive heart failure, d) other.

dialysis or kidney transplantation. 
(6) Severe Visual Impairment : defined as poor or worse visual function on the general 
visual function question on the National Eye Institute Visual Function 
Questionnaire.(Mangione, 2001; Naeim, 2006; Raphael, 2006)

As mentioned previously, the composite endpoint of the VADT -FS is somewhat more 
restrictive than that for the VADT .  However , the protocol for determining all components 
of the VADT -FS’s comp osite endpoint will be identical to that used during the VADT 
(outlined in Appendix B), with two exceptions. Due to the absence of routine study 
examinations in the VADT -FS, we do not have standard collection of periodic 
electrocardiograms, visual acuity, or retinal examinations after May 2008 , the end of the 
VADT . By [CONTACT_854649], new ECG findings consistent with a myocardial infarction 
(such as new q -waves) could have result ed in a determination of the subject reaching the 
AMI endpoint even in the absence of symptoms, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a clinical diagnosis. 
However, in the absence of standard collection of ECG’s from study subjects, we feel that to use ECG’s ordered for clinical indications as part of the primary composite endpoint could 
introduce substa ntial ascertainment bias (only those having ECG’s ordered by [CONTACT_854650]). In addition, although this endpoint has been shown to be diagnostically valid (high specificity for the subject having truly had a sub-clinical AMI), the clinical implications of these subclinical events are less 
clear. For example, the economic costs and patient morbidity are minimal to none in the 
short -term and the long -term morbidity and mortality risk implications of these  
subclinical infarctions have not been well studied. Therefore, since the VADT -FS proposes 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] “softer” endpoints from the primary composite outcome (see below), droppi[INVESTIGATOR_854599]. For the above reasons, only acute myocardial infarctions that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854600] -FS.  
Although eye disease is not a component of the VADT -FS’s primary outcome, it is a very 
important co mponent of a secondary outcome (major microvascular events). As above, 
the discontinuation of standard routine physical examinations makes continuation of visual acuity and retinopathy stage determinations problematic. Fortunately, there is now available a patient self -report visual function tool that has been developed with NIH 
support.(Mangione, 2001; Naeim, 2006; Raphael, 2006) This National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire includes a validated single question for general visual function, and those reporting poor or worse function on this item have been validated to have substantial functional impairment impacting their quality of life (Mangione, [ADDRESS_1190176]. Carol Mangione in January 2007). Although caution is alway s advised when including a new measure during the course of a 
longitudinal study, we feel that the adoption of this validated item measuring marked visual impairment is preferable to droppi[INVESTIGATOR_854601]. 
Patients with reported v isual problems will be informed that they can complete their 
surveys either using the assistance of their designated surrogate or by [CONTACT_756], 
whichever they prefer.  
Primary study end-point: Major CV events (non -fatal MI resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], non -fatal stroke, new CHF, 
amputation for ischemic diabetic gangrene, or CV -related death).  
The proposed primary end-point of the VADT- FS is slightly more restrictive than the  
primary end- point of the VADT [excluding some CV procedures and subclinical AMI’s 
based upon ECG changes alone] because the increased statistical power of the VADT -FS 
will allow greater focus on major clinical outcomes and avoid outcomes that are more difficult to discern (e.g., worsening of symptoms) or are more discretionary (e.g., cardiac 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.1

procedures). 
Major secondary end-points: 
1. CV mortality  
2. Major  microvascular complications (end- stage renal disease, or amputation for 
non-traumatic, non- ischemic diabetic gangrene).  
3. Health -related quality of life (as measured by [CONTACT_854651]  a 0-100 
point scale)  
4. Total mortality  
 
Update  
We have revised the composition of our adjudication team, which now includes [ADDRESS_1190177]. This change was made because fewer neurological and cardiac outcomes are being adjudicat ed in the VADT -F than in 
the original VADT, ma king hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854602].  
 We propose adding a fifth secondary end-point: Major microvascular or macrovascular complication (end-stage renal disease, amputation for e ither 
ischemic or non-ischemic gangrene, CV-related death, or nonfatal MI, stroke, or new CHF).” This secondary endpoint was added for two reasons.  First, this is a composite of all major micro- and macro-vascular endpoints and therefore has better statis tical power and great clinical importance. Second, this also helps 
when making direct comparisons with other trials. The addition of this outcome was recommended by [CONTACT_19305], who is blinded to all outcome data in the VADT -FS and therefore th is recommendation was made without any 
knowledge of results to date. (Note: New CHF will be determined by a subject having either: 1. A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854603] a primary discharge diagnosis of CHF, or 2. chart review finding an ejection fraction on echocardiogr am estimated as being 
below 40%.) 
Healthcare Utilization & Cost Data  
Initial collection of recent data on healthcare utilization and costs incurs a fairly modest cost, but such data collection can be much more expensive when done retrospectively. 
Therefore , we will obtain permission to collect this data, but no initial funds are being 
requested for data cleaning and analysis. (Barnett, 2003; Wagner, 2003; Phibbs, 2003) 
Funds for analysis of data on total direct healthcare costs will be requested in a separa te 
proposal, and funds for formal cost -effectiveness analysis will only be requested if the 
intervention is eventually shown to produce statistically significant benefit. This is similar to incurring the small costs of storing extra sera to be analyzed as indicated. We 
estimate that the cost to obtain and store this data at the same time that we obtain information on potential outcomes to be < $10,[ADDRESS_1190178] analyses are needed, the costs associated with study events to date (i.e. amputations, renal failure, visual

impairment, MI , etc) can be used to estimate the costs of subsequent events. 
However, in addition to the major complications and procedures listed above in 
the Endpoints Section, we will also continue to collect information on the number of outpatient visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854604], and total pharmacy costs, since these are easily collected centrally and account for the majority of medical care costs associated with diabetes care and complications.  
Study Organization and Administration:  
Study Co -Chairs  
Central Office had  approved a change in c o –Chairmanship from Drs. Abraira and 
Duckworth who will continue to serve as the co -Chairs Emeritus of the study to  Drs. Reaven 
and Emanuele . The co- Chairs will have primary responsibility for oversight of the study, 
in close collab oration with the Executive Committee, the Cooperative Studies Program 
Coordinating Center at Hines and the Clinical Data Collection Center in Ann Arbor. They will also serve as the Co -Chairs of the Executive Committee.  
 
The Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center  
The Hines Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center (CSPCC) will continue to serve as the Data Coordinating Center for the study. The Hines CSPCC will coordinate all administrative activities for the study . The Hines CSPCC will have principal 
responsibility for all analyses. They will also prepare  the endpoint analyses needed for 
interim reports and will be responsible for archiving and documentation of all study data at completion of the study. 
The study subjects will be contact[CONTACT_854652], with the initial contact [CONTACT_53339] t hat 
began in June 2009 so as to establish a baseline for the quality of life data. Responders data 
will be received by [CONTACT_854653], at the Ann 
Arbor the surveys will undergo an initial visual edit and then forwarded for data entry and 
verification before being added to the Master Study Data Base. Response information will be 
provided to the Ann Arbor VAMC to allow for repeat mailings and reminders to be sent to non-responder s. The anticipated data flow is presented in Figure 1.  
Although all data will eventually reside at the Hines CSPCC, personnel at the Ann Arbor VAMC will be responsible for updating the patient’s contact [CONTACT_854654]. The Hines CSPCC will forward any updates in contact [CONTACT_854655]. Ann Arbor VAMC will periodically (at least annually) provide the Hines CSPCC with a copy of the most recent Contact [CONTACT_854656]. At Hines CSPCC the Contact [CONTACT_854657] a computer directory separate from the study data, the file will be encrypted and password protected.

The adjudication form fo r each event investigated will be forwarded to the Hines CSPCC 
for data entry and inclusion in the Study Master File. 
The Clinical Data Collection Center  
The Ann Arbor HSR&D Center of Excellence (COE) will have principal responsibility for 
centralized dat a collection of medical record information necessary for adjudicating 
endpoints (data not readily available from national data sources) and providing this data 
to the Data Coordinating Center at Hines for integration with the comprehensive study database. The Clinical Data Collection Center will also have principal responsibility for 
informing the Hines CSPCC of updated contact [CONTACT_854662]. Further, this site will continue to collect resource utilization and cost information, as it has since the beginning of the VADT. 
Finally, they will be in charge of obtaining and preparing clinical summaries for endpoint adjudication by [CONTACT_854637], completing the final adjudication form and forwarding it to Hines CSPCC for inclusion in the Master File.  
Update  
Ann Arbor Coordinating Center: During the course of data collection for the VADT -FS thus far, it has become clear that there are clear advantages to having 
the VA Ann Arbor HSR&D Center  of Excellence take over all central data 
collection activities. The Ann Arbor Center was in charge of many of these activities from the outset of the VADT -FS, so this is just a consolidation of data 
collection activities. The Ann Arbor Center has extensive experience and ongoing studies that utilize all of the datasets being used for central data collection in the VADT -FS. In addition to improved economies of scale, consolidating all these 
activities at the Ann Arbor Center will decrease the chances of con fusion or 
miscommunication that can occur when responsibilities are divided across Centers. The Ann Arbor HSR&D Center will access the information from VA’s central data repositories every 6 months (such as the Medical SAS datasets at Austin, which contain inpatient and outpatient data, the DSS lab, the Pharmacy Benefits National Data Extracts, and Medicare files) and review medical record information on selected patients with potential primary endpoints for adjudication by [CONTACT_854637] (see below). They will also continue to conduct the patient survey. The Ann Arbor Center will then deliver these data to the Hines Cooperative Studies Center for data analysis, along with full documentation of data collection details. [CONTACT_854681] will lead this effo rt and be directly 
responsible for oversight and coordination of these data collection activities. All investigators and staff in Ann Arbor are working with fully blinded data except for the data manager, who needs access to unique patient identifiers to allow her to obtain new follow- up data from central databases. Jennifer Davis is an 
experienced and expert data manager, but she has no access to other VADT or VADT -FS data, and has no other role in the VADT- FS other than the initial data 
pull and is blinde d to treatment arm.  
Hines VA Coordinating Center: The Hines Cooperative Studies Center will continue to be in charge of all statistical analyses, including verification that all primary analyses conducted are fully prespecified. All analyses must be initially approved by [CONTACT_854663] #465-F Protocol 4.1

statistician(s).  
Executive Committee  
The Executive Committee will be the major decision -making body with primary 
responsibility for study management. The committee will direct operational aspects of 
the study, decide on all proposed changes in the protocol, and decide on all uses of 
study data. In the latter role, the committee will make all decisions regarding publication 
policies and will review all manuscripts and abs tracts from the study and approve these for 
submission. Initially, the Executive Committee will have monthly conference calls, with 
the frequency of ongoing conference calls to be decided by [CONTACT_854664].  
 
Data Monitoring Committee: 
Since the VADT -FS is an observational study and includes no research related clinical 
interventions, the main task of the Data Monitoring Committee will be to assure data quality, ongoing blinding of the study results, adherence to the pre -specified analysis p lan, 
overall study progress and whether assumptions regarding statistical power are met. In addition to overseeing the integrity of scientific quality of data, this committee will examine unblinded analyses of primary and secondary endpoints every year. Si nce the 
intervention will no longer be in effect there will be no interim monitoring rule. The 
study biostatistician will present the Committee with interim reports and unblinded 
outcome data annually. The study Chairs and other Executive Committee members  will 
not be privy  to these interim reports. The previous CSP #465 Data Monitoring 
Committee w as asked to participate and continue s to serve as the DMC for the follow -up 
study.  
Endpoint Evaluation Committee

Measuring Endpoints.

Analysis Plan. 
Statistical power  
We considered a 20% reduction in primary events to be a reasonable goal of intensive 
glycemic control over the anticipated [ADDRESS_1190181] of that 
size given the level of achieved A1c separation, and the perceived value to the patient of 
this level of benefit relative to the risk and burden of intensive glycemic control. In 
addition, a 20% reduction is consistent with the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals of the level of association between A1c and cardiovascular events reported in observational analyses (Nathan, 2005; Selvin, 2004). 
Given the current rate of overall events observed in the VADT, Table 2. below shows the 
expected statistical power that the VADT -FS will have for its primary and secondary 
outcome measures. As a continuous measure, statistical power for health related quality 
of life will be eve n better.

death).  
§ Microvascular events include: end -stage renal disease, irreversible severe visual impairment [i.e., excludes visual acuity problems 
correctable by [CONTACT_359993]], or amputation for ischemic diabetic gangren e). 
 
Update   
 Given the achieved sample size of the VADT -FS Main Cohort (N= 1031 as of July 
31, 2011), the updated power at 15- year follow -up is now 86.3%, which is still 
excellent. Based on additional information, the power for detecting effects for CV and total mortality are better than what we previously thought but are still under 
30%.  Although power for mortality is still poor, these results will be useful for inclusion in future meta- analyses.  
Objective #1: To determine the long term effects of intensive glycemic control in type 2 diabetes on major cardiovascular complications (primary outcome). The primary outcome measure is the time to the first of any of the following events: nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke, new congestive heart failure, amp utation for 
ischemic gangrene, or cardiovascular death. The assessment of endpoints comparing the 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190182] will be used to compare complication -free survival between the two treatment 
groups. (Halpern, 1987) Preliminary analyses suggest that the treatment groups were quite similar on important factors at baseline, so we do not anticipate n eeding to use Cox 
proportional hazards regression to control for baseline confounding.(Halpern, 1987) However, Cox proportional hazards regression methods will be used to perform a time -
dependent covariate survival analysis of the primary outcome. This analysis will adjust for risk factors post intervention such as A1 c, weight, BMI, SPB, DBP, cholesterol, HDL,  
LDL, use as time dependent covariates. The progress report will include these post-intervention risk factors summarized over time  as available through database 
search . 
 
Objective #2. To determine the long term effects of intensive glycemic control in type 2 
diabetes on four secondary outcomes: a) cardiovascular mortality, b) major microvascular complications, c) health- related quality of life,  d) tota l mortality , and e) 
major microvascular or macrovascular (end- stage renal disease, amputation for either 
ischemic or non -ischemic gangrene, CV -related death, or nonfatal MI, stroke, or new 
CHF) . Statistical analyses for secondary outcomes will be identical  to those used for the 
primary outcome, with the exception of microvascular complications and health related 
quality of life. Since one of the microvascular complications, severe visual impairment, is from the annual survey, survival analysis is not appropriate for the inaccuracy of the time of the record but logistic regression analysis. Since health related quality of life is 
a continuous measure, survival analysis will not be appropriate for this secondary 
outcome. The Student t -test will be used to evaluate for differences in mean quality -of-life 
scores in the two treatment arms, with use of robust methods if there is evidence that 
variance estimates vary between the two groups. It is well known that if there is a 
substantial difference in survival between intervention groups, health related quality of life 
results can be misleading unless the survival differences are accounted for. Therefore, if there 
are substantial differences in survival between treatment groups, an alternative analysis 
accounting for  missing data due to mortality is a Bayesian imputation approach.(Revicki, 
2001) Again, since substantive differences in baseline attributes did not occur, we do not feel that controlling for potential confounders using ordinary least squares regression is necessary.  
Update  
We have added a composite measure “Major Microvascular & Macrovascular Events, which is simply an aggregate of the primary outcome with the secondary outcome  for microvascular outcomes.   Statistical analyses for secondary outcomes 
will be identical to those used for the primary outcome, with the exception of 
health related quality of life.  Since health related quality of life is a continuous measure, survival analysis will not be appropriate for this secondary outcome. The Student t- test will be used to evaluate for differences in mean quality -of-life scores 
in the two treatment arms, with use of robust methods if there is evidence that variance estimates vary between the two groups. It is well known that if there is a substantial differ ence in survival between intervention groups, health related

quality of life results can be misleading unless the survival differences are 
accounted for. Therefore, if there are substantial differences in survival between treatment groups, an alternative analysis accounting for missing data due to mortality using a Bayesian imputation approach (Revicki, 2001), which will be done by [CONTACT_854665]. Again, since substantive differences in baseline attributes did not occur, we do not feel that controlling for potential confounders using ordinary least squares regression is necessary. For the quality of measure, we will deal with confounding due to systematic m ortality 
differentials between treatment arms by [CONTACT_854666], as recommended 
in Assessing Quality of Life in Clinical Trials: Methods and Practice  (eds . Fayer 
P, Hays R, April 2005.) 
Update : (Early Analysis)  
The major protocol amendment for the VADT -F was that a mid -point analysis 
would be conducted and reported, which was made and published as planned.  We 
now plan for an early analysis to take place shortly before data is fully completed 
with adjudicated outcomes and locked. There is to prepar e to submit an important 
presentation in time to take place at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
[ADDRESS_1190183] of the intensive treatment, and all presentations and papers will use 
fully completed and locked data. 
We therefore believe that the benefits of an early analysis provide substantial 
benefit to the diabetes community and do so at essentially no risk to the integrity 
of the VADT -F. 
Other Analysis Considerations  
Interaction (Subgroup) Effects 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.1
29
July 6, 2017
The improved statistical power of the VADT -FS allows us more freedom to examine 
interaction effects (subject baseline attributes that modify the treatment effect) than is 
possible in the VADT. However, our only a priori hypotheses regarding biological factors that may modify the treatment effect relate to patient attributes that affect the likelihood of the outcomes. As has been recently reported, in such instances it is preferable to combine risk factors into a risk score whenever feasible (which will generally dramatically improve statistical power as well as diminish problems inherent in multiple comparisons)(Brookes, 2004; Hayward, 2005). Therefore, rather than look at cardiovascular risk factors in isolation, we will combine these risk factors into the 
Framingham risk score (Hayward, 2006). As reported by [CONTACT_854667], statistical power for such interaction effects is further improved if these interaction effects are examined as continuous variables using Cox proportional hazard modeling, rather than subdividing the risk score into categories.(Brookes, 2001) Consequently, we will examine whether the treatment effect is modified by a subject’s 10 -year risk of CV events (as predicted by a 
subject’s baseline Framingham score), which will test whether the hazard ratio varies conditional on baseline overall CV risk.(Wilson, 1998) Similarly, we will conduct regression analyses examining for interaction effects between treatment arm and a study subject’s risk of major microvascular complications, using the prediction model discussed above (Vijan, 1997). 
Evaluation of  Mechanisms of  Action  
In addition to examining interaction effects (factors that modify the intervention’s effect), 
we will examine factors that are hypothesized to  mediate the interaction effect. Whereas 
interaction effects are part of the experimental analysis (examining baseline [pre-randomization] subject attributes that identify individuals or groups who will benefit more or less than average), examination of potential mediating factors are observational  
analyses (examining factors post -treatment but prior to the occurrence of an outcome 
trying to better understand the treatment’s mechanism(s) of action).(Hayward, 2006) There are two principle hypothesized mechan isms of action for why improved metabolic 
control may reduce CV events: 1) direct effects of hyper -glycemia on blood vessels and 
atherosclerotic disease, and 2) decreasing the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy and proteinuria (microvascular complications known to increase with hyperglycemia), which 
in turn reduces risk of CV events. We will examine these two factors following the methods used in the DCCT/EDIC.(Nathan, 2005) The variable examining direct hyperglycemic effects will be based upon the log of c umulative average A1c (previous 
observational analyses have consistently reported a log- linear association between A1c 
and adverse outcomes), which will be updated annually for all subjects who have not yet reached the endpoint. Markers for diabetic nephropathy previously reported to be associated with CV risk, include presence of proteinuria and estimated GFR. In addition to the log of cumulative average A1c, proteinuria and GFR, this analysis will control for a subject’s other CV risk factors.  (Fleiss, 19 86) Cox proportional hazards regression will 
be used for these analyses, except for the visual impairment outcome which was not collected during the original VADT. Since time of the event is not available, logistic regression will be used for this outcome.  Missing Data In longitudinal studies relying on survey or tests ordered in routine clinical practice, problems of missing data will almost always increase. Fortunately, our primary outcome and three of our four secondary outcomes do not rely on these dat a sources. However, our 
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190184] multiple imputation te chniques will be utilized so as 
to prevent diminished sample size and potential response bias due to droppi[INVESTIGATOR_854605].(King, 2001; Revicki, 2001; Caroll, 1995) Imputed values for a given covariate will be informed by [CONTACT_28045]’s values for all other observed covariates to be used in the regression model, as well as temporal trends in the study population and previous values for that covariate in the individual. Multiple imputation is preferable in such instances, since it accounts for the degree of precision in imputed values and therefore provides better variance estimates for all regression coefficients.  (King, 2001; Clayton, 1991; Caroll, 1995; Gatsonis, 1995; Oppenheimer, 
1999)  
Updates  
There are no anticipated changes in the planned analyses, other than the addition of the new composite secondary endpoint, “Major Microvascular & Macrovascular Events” (see Endpoints Section)  except severe visual impairment, 
which will be analyzed independently from other outcomes using only data 
collected through self -administered survey questionnaire during this follow-up 
period since 2009.  
 
Study Significance.  
The proposed extension of the  VADT Follow- up Study (VADT -FS) would capi[INVESTIGATOR_135814] a 
unique opportunity to examine factors that  are associated with long -term complications and 
mortality for people with one of the most important conditions in modern medicine, a 
disease that will continue to grow dramatically if current epi[INVESTIGATOR_854606]. Given the results of the  [LOCATION_006]PDS  Follow -up Study and the  DCCT -EDIC study, the objectives 
of the VADT -FS are important to answer in order to better assess possible multiplicative 
temporal effects and to obtain adequate statistical power to assess mortality benefits directly. It will also provide an opportunity to assess the long -term impact of tight 
glycemic control on vision and renal insufficiency when tight blood pressure control is 
achieved, a question unanswered by [CONTACT_49808].

July 6, 2017
CSP #465 (VADT) Endpoint Definitions 
 
PRIMARY ENDPOINTS  
1. MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION  
Myocardial infarctions will be determined based on the algorithm supplied at the end of 
this appendix. All suspected MI will be evaluated in detail by [CONTACT_854647]. All supporting documentation, i.e., ECGs, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory values, etc. needed to confirm or rule out the presence or absence of an MI will be obtained by [CONTACT_854668]. 
2. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE – also see revised definition be low: 
Diagnosis of new congestive heart failure (CHF) can be made in the presence of at least 
two major manifestations of CHF or one major and at least two minor manifestations or new onset of pulmonary congestion requiring treatment. Treatment with diureti c, 
digitalis glycoside, ACE inhibitor, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854610]. 
Major Criteria:  
1) paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea 
2) distended neck veins 
3) cardiomegaly and pulmonary hilar congestion on X- ray, or increased heart siz e 
4) acute pulmonary edema  
5) increased venous pressure 
6) hepatojuglar reflux 
7) documented 10% or greater decrease in ejection fraction to less than 40%.  
Minor Criteria: 
1) bilateral ankle edema  
2) night cough 
3) dyspnea on normal exertion 
4) hepatomegaly  
5) pleural effusion 
Diagnosis of worsening CHF, for patients entering the Study with NYHA Class I or II CHF, will be 
made if there is a 10% (absolute) decrease in LVEF. Baseline assessment of LVEF must be made within the six months prior to randomization. 
REVISED CHF DEFINIT ION: meets all criteria shown above with the additional requirement 
that the patient will have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854611]. Aggressive treatment today (2003) primarily includes intravenous treatment with diuretics and/or inotropic agents. However, as the study progresses, this list may be expanded to include newer oral agents. The aim of this additional condition is to ensure that the visit was accompanied by, if not precipi [INVESTIGATOR_216020], moderate to severe CHF symptoms.”

July 6, 2017
3. STROKE  
Occurrence and documentation (with copi[INVESTIGATOR_854612]) of 
cerebrovascular accident, subject to evaluation by [CONTACT_854647], will be counted as a primary endpoint. 
Non-hemorrhagic stroke is defined as the sudden onset of localizing neurologic defect 
(e.g. hemoparesis, aphasia, homonymous hemianopsia) persisting for> [ADDRESS_1190210]. Embolic stroke is indicated by [CONTACT_854669] (e.g. atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, recent myocardial infarction, endocarditis), a 
consistent clinical course (e.g., rapid onset and claring, localized defect, possibly bloody spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]) and/or other peripheral emboli. 
Results of imagining procedures, accompanied by a summary of a neurologist’s examination or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_854613] -up are to be included in the endpoint evaluation. No 
other disease process or event such as a brain typor, trauma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, inflammatory disease, metabolic disorder, or peripheral lesion that could cause localized neurological deficit or course will be considered as an endpoint. 
4. AMPUTATION  
Amputation due to ischemic gangrene will be counted, with pathological report 
confirming the diagnosis. 
5. CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH  
Cardiovascular death is classified by [CONTACT_854637]. An autopsy will be 
performed whenever poss ible. Major categories are sudden death, coronary heart disease, 
cerebrovascular accident, and other cardiovascular events (e.g. cardiomyopathy). The definition of sudden death will be used from the Framinham Study: death within one hour from the onset of symptoms, and if the cause of death could not be attributed to 
some potentially lethal disease other than coronary heart disease. Sudden death will be further classified as unexpected if the patient did not have a previous history of cardiovascular heart disease.  
CSP #465-F Protocol 4.[ADDRESS_1190211] often used to characterize a patient’s limitation 
from angina pectoris. It is modified slightly from the [LOCATION_001] Heart Associa tion 
functional class.  
CLASS I Ordinary physical activity, such as walking and climbing stairs, does 
not cause angina. Angina occurs with strenuous, rapid or prolonged exertion during work or recreational activity. 
CLASS II  Slight limitations of ordinary a ctivity by [CONTACT_805846]. Angina pectoris 
occur  
when walking or stair climbing, after meals, or in cold, or I wind, or under emotional stress, or only during the few hours after awakening. Angina pectoris may also occur when walking more than ? blocks on 
the leve l and climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a 
normal pace and in normal conditions. 
CLASS III Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Angina pectoris 
occurs when walking one to two blocks on the level and climbing 
one flight of stair s in normal conditions and at normal pace. 
CLASS IV  Inability to carry on any physical activity without anginal discomfort. Angina may be present at rest.

 Dear [CONTACT_343296]:  
 Thank you for  your participation in the VA Diabetes Trial (VADT, CSP #465).  As you 
know, the clinic visits and examination portion of this important study ended in 2008.  The results of this study were very important and helped change the way diabetes is treated in the VA and around the world.  
 We are very grateful that you agreed to continue to participate in the VADT Follow -up 
Study, which only consists of tracking a few parts of your medical history using VA and other databases.  This , therefore, requires no action on your part. There may also be an 
occasional voluntary survey to get your opi[INVESTIGATOR_854620].  
 This letter is to inform you about a slight change in the Follow -up Study which will not in 
any way affect what you do to participate, or how you receive your local healthcare. Because the VADT  Follow -up Study does  not require local VA visits,  it has been 
administratively closed at your VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. However , the study will now be run centrally 
from the Hines VA Medical Center under direction of [CONTACT_854683] and [CONTACT_854684], who helped run the VADT. We are asking that you continue to 
participate in this study by [CONTACT_854676]; HIPAA and Informed Consent (postage pre -paid). Again, the only change is the central 
administration of the study by [CONTACT_854677].  
  Your ongoing participation is very important to the success of this study, and we hope that you will choose to sign and return the forms. Other medical studies have reported that some of the most important information comes during these follow -up periods.  In 
order for this study to maintain the highest level of scientific accuracy, having information on each participant is extremely valuable and important, and we cannot 
continue to collect that information unless you sign and return the enclosed documents.   
 For questions about your rights as a research participant or to discuss problems, complaints or concerns about the study, contact [CONTACT_854678] 708- 202-5701.   
  We thank you for your time and assistance with the VADT Follow -up Study and for 
returning the enclosed forms.

 Dear [CONTACT_343296]:  
 Thank you for  your ongoing participation in the VA Diabetes Trial (VADT, CSP #465).  As you know, 
the clinic visits and examination portion of this important study ended in 2008.  We are very grateful that you have agreed to continue to participate in the VADT  Follow -up Study.  The Follow -up Study 
simply consists of tracking your medical history by [CONTACT_854679]. In addition, there is a voluntary  annual survey  that is performed by [CONTACT_2319].  
 
This letter is to inform you about  a very slight change in the Follow -up Study which will not in any 
way affect what you do to participate or how you receive your local healthcare.  Since the active part 
of the VADT was completed in 2008, the study will now be run centrally from the Hines V A Medical 
Center under direction of [CONTACT_854683] and [CONTACT_854684]. Although this change is 
very minimal and will not affect anything that you agreed to previously, we did want to give you a 
chance to ‘opt out ’ of the Study. If you do not agree to continue participation (decide you no longer 
wish to continue), please sign the attached page and mail it back in the self -addressed envelope.  
  
Your  ongoing participation is very important to the success of this study, and we hope that you will 
choose to remain in the program. Other studies have reported that some of the most important 
information comes during these follow -up periods.   In order for this study to maintain the highest 
level of scientific accuracy, having information on each participant is extremely valuable and important.   
  For questions about your rights as a research participant or to discuss problems, complaints or 
concerns about the study, contact [CONTACT_562107] 708- 202-5701.   
  If nothing is returned, we will assume that you wish to continue to allow us to track your medical 
information and receive the mailed questionnaires.  
  We thank you for your time and assistance with the VADT Follow -up Study.  
 Sincerely,

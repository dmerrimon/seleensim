1. Abstract  
Many individuals in need of a kidney transplant will die on the transplant waitlist before ever 
receiving a donor offer due to a national organ shortage crisis.  At the same time, many high quality kidneys from hepatitis C infected (HCV+) donors are discarded every year because there is not a HCV+ candidate available to accept the organ.  New HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_571875] 100%.  ,This is a single center 
open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_571876] C therapy for 10 HCV -negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571877]+ -positive deceased donors at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JHH). Individuals who meet the 
inclusion criteria will be offered  enrollment.  Informed consent will be obtained by a physician on 
the study team and those who provide informed consent will be enrolled. All participants will be initiated on oral, once- daily, fixed -dose GZR- EBR start ing at the time of transplant. Treatmen t 
adjustments will be made based on donor genotype information, as detailed below: 
• Donor genotype 1a without NS5a resistance- associated variants (RAVs): GZR -EBR will be 
continued daily for 12 weeks 
• Donor genotype 1a with NS5a RAVs at position 28, 30, 31 or 93: renally -dosed ribavirin 
will be added to GZR-EBV for 16 weeks from the day of treatment adjustment 
• Donor genotype 2 or 3: Sofosbuvir (SOF) will be added for 12 weeks from the day of 
treatment adjustment 
 
2. Objectives  
 
Primary objective:  
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of grazoprevir 100 
mg/elbasvir 50 mg (GZR- EBR) treatment in HCV -uninfected transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (HCV R- ) of a 
kidney from an HCV- infected deceased donor (HCV D+).  GZR -EBR will be administered on -call 
to the operating room (OR) for the renal transplant procedure and continued for [ADDRESS_750958]- renal 
transplant. The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of HCV D+/R- renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571878] (< LLOQ) 12 weeks 
after end of treatment. The primary tolerability outcome will be the incidence of adverse events (AE) related to GZR -EBR.

 Secondary objectives: 
• Proportion of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571879] < LLOQ at 2, 4, 8 
weeks after discontinuation of therapy.  
• Proportion of kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201832] 
• Prevalence of NS5A resistance mutations in the HCV population from the deceased donors 
• Measurement of interferon (IFN) -gamma inducible protein 10 (IP- 10) a marker of acute 
hepatitis C infection.  
• Kidney allograft function at 6 and 12 months following transplantation. 
 
3. Background  
Organ Shortage. Over 100,000 individuals are awaiting a life- saving kidney transplant in the United 
States, however due to a shortage of deceased donor organs, less than 17,000 kidney transplants are 
performed each year [1]. Depending on geography and patient characteristics, waiting times in the [LOCATION_002] can be up to  [ADDRESS_750959] mortality for 
all individuals was 5% [1]. The death rate for older individuals or for individuals with diabet es is 
about 10% per year. Therefore, a patient > [ADDRESS_750960] time of five years for a kidney has a 50% chance of dying before a kidney becomes available [2,3]. 
 
An Underutilized Source of Organs . Kidneys from hepatitis C-infected (HCV+) donors are 
currently underutilized. In 2013, 56% of kidneys from HCV+ deceased donors were discarded compared to 18% of kidneys from HCV-uninfected (HCV-) donors [1]. Many of these HCV+ organs are of excellent quality, but are frequently discarded due to a lack of HCV+ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [4].   
 
Use of HCV+ Organs for HCV- Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . There was a small study performed in 2012 that 
provided kidneys from HCV+ deceased donors to elderly HCV- individuals on dialysis who had limited donor options. In this series, HCV donor to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571880] 7/13 (54%) of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Of those who acquired HCV, elevations in transaminases occurred in 6/[ADDRESS_750961]-transplant [5]. HCV treatment was not used in this study since only IFN- based 
treatments were available and IFN is contraindicated in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Thus in the 
absence of any prophylactic HCV treatment, incident HCV in fection occurred in about 50% of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571881]+ kidneys and the majority did not have severe complications of the infection.  
 
Currently Implemented Analogue: Infectious Risk Donors (IRDs) . For individuals with high waitlist 
mortality, the lifesaving b enefit of accepting an organ may outweigh the risk of acquiring an 
infection. In the past, standard donor screening used serology to detect infections such as HIV and HCV. Due to the biologic “window period” of approximately [ADDRESS_750962] developed antibody, but can transmit infection, organs from donors who meet behavioral criteria, so -called “high risk” or infectious risk donors (IRDs), were discarded. This 
practice led to discarding more than 10% of deceased donor organs [4]. 
 Our group at Johns Hopkins proposed screening IRDs with rapid nucleic acid testing screening to replace serologic screening for HIV and HCV in IRDs [5]. In addition, we designed a Markov decision model, to guide patients weighing the survival be nefit against the potential risks of using 
an IRD [7]. This principle has been successfully put into practice and has safely provided organs 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA  01 
Version 3 Dated:  06/[ADDRESS_750963] kidneys at Johns Hopkins 
[8]. 
 
Direct Acting  Antivirals as pre - and post- exposure treatment. The once daily fixed -dose 
combination of the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir (GZR) and the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir 
(EBR) is highly safe and effective for the treatment of chronic HCV infection with sus tained 
virologic response rates between 95-100% [9]. These drugs are not renally metabolized and therefore would be ideal in the early post-transplant period following a kidney transplant. We propose to use these medications as pre- and post- exposure treat ment as a strategy to provide high 
quality HCV+ organs to HCV- recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571882] - organ.  
 
4. Study Procedures  
Screening phase: HCV- individuals on the kidney t ransplant waitlist at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571883]. Individuals who are interested in the study will give informed consent. We will approach HCV - individuals on the deceased donor renal transplant wait 
list who meet the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_201842].  Currently there are about 200 individuals meeting 
these criteria at JH.  At JH approximately 50% of wait- list candidates currently will accept 
Infectious Risk Donors (IRDs). We anticipate a lower acceptance rate of HCV+ deceased donors and estimate a 10% participation rate.  Therefore we estimate having a pool of at least 20 eligible 
screened participants.  Once a patient signs a consent form, a unique baseline number will be 
assigned for identification purposes. The particip ant will be screened to identify if the participant is 
currently being prescribed any medications that are contraindicated to  any of the study medication. 
If the patient is taking a medication that is contraindicated with the study medication  or rescue 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  the investigator will assess if the participant’s medication can be safely discontinued or 
substituted prior to, or at the time of transplant.  If the participant’ s prescribed medication cannot be 
safely discontinued or substituted then the participant will be removed from the study.  Prior to transplantation, data on demographics (age, sex, race, etc), medical history, social history, and renal biopsy diagnosis will be collected. 
 
HCV+ Donor Identification: Those who provide informed consent for the study, will have be listed 
in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) with a status of “willing to accept an HCV+ organ.”   The JHU transplant team will then receive HCV+ donor kidney offers for the study participant from Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO).    If an HCV+ donor who meets the inclusion criteria is identified, the study participants will be offered the organ and if they accept, they will become an active treatment participant.  A donor blood sample will also be obtained from the OPO for the purposes of this study.  Currently, offering OPOs only perform a qualitative HCV RNA by [CONTACT_201863] – HCV quantification and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_571884].  Donor HCV RNA quantification and genotype will be performed in parallel with the transplantation and initiation of treatment.  The OPO will ship a donor blood sample to Quest for HCV genotype using LiPA® assay HCV RNA quantification will be performed at JHH using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV v2.0 assays.  Plasma will also be banked for future resistance testing if needed.  
 
Active phase, transplant and treatment : At the time of transplant admission, kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571885]- operative work-up, including laboratory testing, chest X-ray, EKG, and 
urinalysis (if applicable).  In addition, a sample for baseline HCV RNA quantification will be drawn. 
Donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571886] T- cell and B -cell complemen t-dependent 
cytotoxicity crossmatch.  In addition, quantitative assessment for the presence of donor specific 
antibody will be done by [CONTACT_201864] (Luminex) and confirmed to be below a flow positive level.  Once a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571887]  01 
Version 3 Dated:  06/2007  
Page 4 of 13 
 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571888],  the initial dose of GZR -EBR will be administered (see treatment 
strategy below).  
 
The deceased donor kidney transplant procedure will be performed in the standard manner under general anesthesia with appropriate monitoring lines.  Intraoperative medications will include 
intravenous cefazolin, heparin, mannitol, and furosemide. Anesthetic medications including inhalational agents, muscle relaxant, narcotic pain medication, and other standard medications will be administered.  Induction immunosuppression administered in the operating room will consist of 
intravenous Solumedrol (500 mg) and intravenous rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (1.5 mg/kg) (Thymoglobulin, Genzyme). During the transplant operation a surgical drain(s), a ureteral stent, and a urinary catheter will be placed.  
 Postoperative care will be performed in the standard manner in a monitored step-down intensive care unit setting.  Ongoing induction immunosuppression with daily Solumedrol and Thymoglobulin 
for three post- operative doses each will be administered.  In addition, maintenance 
immunosuppressive therapy consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone will be initiated.  Tacrolimus dosing will be adjusted to obtain a serum trough concentration between 7-
10 ng/ml for the first three months postoperatively and then 6-8 ng/ml beyond three months. Mycophenolate mofetil will be administered in divided doses for a total dose of 1500-[ADDRESS_750964] posttransplant prophylaxis strategies will be used in subjects for the prevention of opportunistic infections. These include trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) for pneumocystis 
pneumonia prophylaxis, valganciclovir for cytomegalovirus infection in cases of CMV seropositive donors and/or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and clotrimazole for fungal prophylaxis.  Additional postoperative care will be performed in the standard manner and include intravenous fluids to replace urine output for the first [ADDRESS_750965] for 3 to 7 days after surgery depending on the condition of the patient’s bladder at the time of the transplant operation. Surgical drain(s) placed at the time of the transplant procedure remain(s) in place until daily output is below [ADDRESS_750966] has a satisfactory understanding of posttransplant care. During the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], teaching of transplant medications and planned follow-up will occur on several occasions.  Included in this teaching will be the protocol medication and the follow-up labs and 
visits related to the study protocol.  
 
Treatment strate gy: The study participant will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201852]-up. Once this is completed, crossmatch results are available, and relevant donor kidney information is available the first dose of GZR- EBR will be administered on call to the 
OR (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 1 -6 hours prior to the incision). Post-transplant, GZR-EBR will be continued daily at 
[ADDRESS_750967] dose pre-transplant at 2:[ADDRESS_750968]-operative day #1 at 10:[ADDRESS_750969] renal transplan t

will be given after dialysis on those days. 
 
Treatment  Adjustment : Donor HCV genotype will be performed by [CONTACT_393914].  For HCV1a 
genotypes, Quest will reflexively perform an assay to identify NS5a resis tant variants at positions 
28, 30, [ADDRESS_750971] that the majority  of HCV+ donors will have GT1 infection.  For example, in the 
last 12 months for our liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], we used 12 HCV RNA+ donors.  The donor HCV genotype is not tested  by [CONTACT_414344] N etwork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) .  However, post- liver 
transplant, there is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a genotype switch from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571889]; of these [ADDRESS_750972]-transplant, indicating that 100% of donors were genotype [ADDRESS_750973] planned for treatment adjustment in the following scenarios  i) the donor is found to have genotype 2 or 3 infection ii) the donor is found to have genotype 1a with NS5a resistant variants detected at positions 28, 30, 31 or 93 or iii) there is HCV viral breakthrough defined as an HCV RNA detect ed at > 100 IU/mL after previously being < LLOQ, confirmed on repeat testing.  In 
these cases of donor genotype 2 or 3 or HCV breakthrough on treatment, sofosbuvir will be added to GZV/EBR and treatment will be extended to complete 12 weeks of triple thera py.  
SOF/GZR/EBR for 12 weeks has been shown to be an effective strategy in genotoype 3 infection [10].    For cases where genotype 1a with RAVs at position 28, 30, [ADDRESS_750974] common reasons for failure to genotype are insufficient viral load, mutations in the viral genome at the assay priming sites, and presence of inhibitory substance in the sample. If a genotype cannot be obtained the participant will continue to be treated with GZR -EBR alone.  
 
Study visits : Study visits will occur at day 0, POD1, 2, 3 and treatment weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, , 8, , 12, 
and follow up weeks (FW) 2, 4, 8, and 12. If treatment adjustments are required and treatment is extended beyond [ADDRESS_750975] immunosuppression regimen, tacrolimus trough, creatinine level, acquisition of opportunistic infections, graft survival and patient survival.  Allograft biopsies will be performed at any other point there is concern for rejection.  Rejection will be classified by [CONTACT_201865].

Antithymocyte globulin which is used as immunosuppression after kidney transplant may impact T 
cell responses irrespective of HCV donor status.    In order to control for this, we will measure T 
cell responses to hepatitis C peptides at baseline and [ADDRESS_750977] received an  HCV+ kidney donor 
transplants.   
 
Data Collection Mechanism . Data collection will be performed using REDCap. All data in REDCap 
will be de -identified. We will maintain a record of which subject corresponds to subject numbers 
assigned by [CONTACT_61604] , and this file will be password protected if electronic or kept in a locked 
location if in the subject binder. 
 
Data monitoring : Upon enrollment of subjects, the REDCap database constructs a calendar of 
anticipated events, which includes completion of follow- up case report forms, with electronic 
reminders. Planning for a data and safety monitoring board and monitoring of the study for 
compliance with Good Clinical Practice and the study protocol. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), will review the protocol for study design and issues of Human Subjects prote ction prior to study implementation. The DSMB will conduct interim administrative, 
statistical, and safety reviews at least annually. Additional interim evaluations of accrual, safety, and/or endpoint data will be scheduled as necessary. We will provide study reports to the DSMB as requested.  
 
Adverse Experience Reporting  
Adverse experience reporting will follow the requirements outlined below. Adverse events will also 
be recorded and tracked in a safety monitoring database by [CONTACT_473].  Serious adverse events 
will be reported to the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University according to IRB guidelines and to the sponsor.  Participants undergoing solid organ transplantation will be expected to have frequent adverse events (AEs) related to the organ transplant surgery and immunosuppressants which are not the subject of this protocol. This protocol focuses on the use of GZR- EBR.  Grade 3 and Grade 4 AEs and SAEs 
related to the use of GZR -EBR will be collected.   
 All Grade 3 or 4 AEs and a ll SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_201855] a 
timely manner.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB. Grade 3 or higher 
AEs that are possibly or definitely related to GZR- EBR will be reported to the IRB.   
 
In addition, we will report to the IRB any new HCV infection in the organ recipi[INVESTIGATOR_571890] 1 week 
of identifying the new infection . 
 
Adverse Event (AE) Definition 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the participant’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of adverse events in the 1996 International Conference on Harmonization E-6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Participants or Others and Adverse Events (1/15/07)" http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2 )   
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA  01 
Version 3 Dated:  06/[ADDRESS_750978] or unf avorable medical occurrence 
associated with, but not limited to:  
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the 
study 
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Infections  
• Abnormal laboratory values (significant shifts from baseline within the range of normal that 
the investigator considers to be clinically important)  
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, weight, and/or tests 
and procedures 
• Surgical complications  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)): 
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 
AEs will be graded according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze 
and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.  
 Adverse events will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual:  
• Grade 1 = mild adverse event.  
• Grade 2 = moderate adverse event.  
• Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event.  
• Grade 4 = life- threatening or disabling adverse event.  
• Grade 5 = death.  
 Events grade 3 or higher that are possibly or definitely related to study procedures or intervention 
will be collected on AE case report.  
 
Attribution Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an adverse event to the study intervention or study procedures will initially be determine d by [CONTACT_093]. For additional information and a printable version of 
the NCI -CTCAE manual, consult the NCI- CTCAE web site: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.

 1. Unrelated:  The adverse event is clearly not related:  there is insufficient evid ence to suggest a 
causal relationship.  
2. Possibly related:  The adverse event has a reasonable possibility to be related; there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
3. Definitely related:  The adverse event is clearly related.  
 
Collection and Recording of Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events will be collected from the time of first dose of study medication until a 
participant completes study participation or until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent) or is withdrawn from the study. Grade 3 or higher AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_201866].  
 
Collecting Adverse Events 
Adverse events (including SAEs) may be discovered through any of these methods: 
• Observing the participant. • Interviewing the participant [e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc.]  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.  
• In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clini cal or laboratory evaluation can also 
indicate an adverse event, as defined in Section 12.3, Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events. 
 
Recording Adverse Events 
Throughout the study, the investigator will review all grade 3 or higher AEs and if potentiall y 
related to a study medication and will report them to the IRB.  All SAEs will be reported to the IRB.  
 Once reported, an AE/SAE will be followed until it resolves with or without sequelae, or until the end of study participation, or until 30 days after the participant prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent)/or is withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first.  Any AEs lower than grade 3 are exempt from Reporting

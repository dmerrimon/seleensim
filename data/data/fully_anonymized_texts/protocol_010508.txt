 4. INTRODUCTION 
The intent of this document is to provide guidance for analyses of data for this Phase 2a study. 
This statistical analysis plan ( SAP) has been developed after review of the Clinical Study Protocol 
203PF201 (version 4 dated 16 July 2015).  
This SAP describes the planned analys es to evaluate  the safety, tolerability, pharma cokinetics 
(PK), immunogenicity, and impact on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood 
biomarkers of multiple doses of STX-100 (BG00011) in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF). Please n ote that study drug names STX -100 and BG00011 are equivalent, and the 
study drug will be referred to as BG00011 in the SAP and associated tables, figures, and listings 
(TFLs) .  A detailed description of the planned TFLs to be presented in the clinical study report 
(CSR) is provided in the accompanying TFL shell document. This SAP must be finalised prior to the lock of the clinical database and unblinding for this study. When the SAP and TFL shells are 
agreed upon and finalized, they will serve as the template for this study’s CSR. 
This version 2.0 SAP s upersedes the statistical considerations identified in the protocol and the 
statistical considerations identified in the version 1.0 SAP dated 06 March 2012; where 
considerations are substantially different, they will be so identified. If additional analys es are 
required to supplement the planned analyses described in this SAP, they will be identified in the CSR. Any substantial deviations from this SAP will be agreed upon between Biogen MA  Inc. and 
 and identified in the CSR.  
This SAP is  written with consideration of the recommendations outlined in the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 Guideline entitled Guidance for Industry: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials
1 and the ICH E3 Guideline entitled Guidance for Indus try: Structure 
and Content of Clinical Study Reports2. 
 
5. STUDY OBJECTIVE S  
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneously ( SC) administered, multiple 
escalating doses of  BG00011 (humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the αvβ6 
integrin) in subjects with IPF  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To estimate the PK parameters after the first dose and after the last dose of multiple, 
escalating doses of BG00011 in subject s with IPF  
• To assess the immunogenicity of BG00011 in subject s with I PF

 • To assess the effect of BG00011 on biomarkers isolated from BAL and peripheral blood 
in subject s with IPF  
 
6. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multi-center, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, dose-
escalation study designed to evaluate the s afety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and impact on 
BAL and peripheral blood biomarkers of BG00011 activity  in subject s with IPF  conducted at 
approximately [ADDRESS_63537] s will be enrolled into 5 sequential ascend ing dose cohorts ( Table 1 ). 
Cohorts will include 8 subjects randomized to receive either BG00011 ([ADDRESS_63538] s) or placebo ([ADDRESS_63539] s). Additional subjects may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_58273] ( DSMB ).  Doses to be administered are as follows: 
Table 1: Dosing Cohorts  
Cohort                  Dose  Number of Subject s 
BG00011 Placebo  
1 0.015 mg/kg  6 2 
2 0.1 mg/kg  6 2 
3 0.3 mg/kg  6 2 
4 1.0 mg/kg  6 2 
5 3.0 mg/kg  [ADDRESS_63540] s with clinical symptoms and features consistent with IPF prior to screening; forced vital 
capacity (FVC) ≥ 50% of predicted value;  carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, corrected for 
hemoglobin (DL
co/Hb) ≥ 30% of predi cted value; oxygen (O 2) saturation > 90% while breathing 
ambient air at rest  or receiving ≤2 L/minute of supplemental oxygen; residual volume (RV) ≤ 
120% of predicted value; a ratio of the forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_31737] (FEV 1) to FVC ≥ 
0.65 after the use of a bronchodilator during screening pulmonary function tests (PFTs); high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern; and who meet the other inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria are eligible to enroll in the study. Subject s who do not qualify for study eligibility may be rescreened at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator.  
Each subject  within a dose cohort will be randomized to receive either BG00011 or placebo and 
will participate in 2 cons ecutive study periods: 1) each subject will receive 8 consecutive weekly 
doses of BG00011 (or placebo) (Period 1; Multiple Dose [MD] phase); and, 2) each subject  will 
be monitored for 12 weeks (8 weeks for Cohorts 4 and 5) following administration of the last dose 
of study drug (Period 2; Follow- Up [FU] Phase).

 6.1 NOMENCLATURE FOR STUDY PERIODS AND STUDY DAYS  
Days for the  MD period are designated with an “MD” and days for the FU period are designated 
with an “FU.”  
• Day [ADDRESS_63541] dose during the MD period of the study. 
• Day [ADDRESS_63542] 
dose during the MD period (Day 50- MD).   
 
7. TREATMENT 
BG00011 will be administered as an SC injection. Doses will be 0.015 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 
mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg. Weight obtained at initial screening will be used to calculate 
dose throughout the study.  At the end of a screening period, eligible subject s will return for 
dosing on Day 1-MD. Study drug will be administered once weekly for 8 doses (7 weeks), i.e., on 
Days [ADDRESS_63543]’s participation in the study will be for approximately 24 weeks 
(~5.5 months), i.e., up to 5 weeks to perform screening/entry evaluations, followed by 7 weeks of double-blind study dosing (8 doses) and a Follow-up period of [ADDRESS_63544]’s participation in the study will be for approximately 23 weeks (~5.5 months), i.e., up to 8 weeks to perform screening/entry evaluations, followed by 7 weeks of double-blind study dosing (8 doses) and Follow-up period of 8 weeks. 
 
8. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFIC ATION  
No formal statistical justification for the sample size was p erformed for this Phase 2a study. 
Cohort size was determined based on requirements for PK  analyses and safety  assessments. With 
6 subjects per cohort administered BG00011 the probability of observing an event is 82% if the 
actual probability of such an event is 25%. 
 
9. DEFINITION OF ANALYS IS POPULATIONS  
The “Safety” population will consist of all subject s who received at least one dose of BG00011 or 
placebo.

 The “Pharmacodynamic”  population will consist of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_63545] a corresponding sample collected for BAL and/or blood 
biomarkers (e.g., Visit 16 Day 8- FU).  
All protocol deviations that occur during the study will be considered for their severity/impact prior to treatment assignment unblindi ng and will be taken into consideration when subjects are 
assigned to analysis populations. Details of subject  assignment to the analysis populations will be 
listed.

deviation (SD), median, minimum (Min) , max imum (Max)  and n; for log -normal data the 
geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation (CV) will also be presented . For 
categorical data, frequency count and percentages will be presented. Data listings will be provided 
for all subject s up to the point of withdrawal, with any subjects excluded from the relevant 
population highlighted. Summary statistics and statistical analyses will generally only be 
performed for subjects included in the relevant analysis population. For the calculation of 
summary statistics and statistical analysis, unrounded data will be used.  
Due to the small number of subjects expected to enroll at each participating center, all summaries and analyses will be performed using data pooled across centers. Data for BG0 [ADDRESS_63547] ’s change from  their  baseline 
value. Each individual change from baseline will be calculated by [CONTACT_58274]’s baseline value from the value at their  subsequent visit(s). The individual subject ’s 
change from  baseline values will be used to calculate the mean change from baseline using a 
SAS
® procedure such as Proc Univariate.  
Data analys es will be performed using SAS® Version 9.1.3 or greater.  
As previously stated (Section 4), this document describes the planned analyses for this Phase 2a study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunog enicity, and impact on BAL and peripheral 
blood biomarker of multiple doses of BG00011 in subject s with IPF. Some of the analyses 
described in this SAP will be performed by [CONTACT_58275]. These data will be imported to the Biometrics  database for study 203PF201 or, alternatively, provided as separate reports .

 10.8.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA Version 14.0 or later ). Summary tables will be based on treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAE) . A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs during or after first dose or which is present 
prior to study drug administration  and becomes more severe during or after first dose. Any event 
occurring prior to the first dose of study medication will be recorded as medical history.  Related events are those classified as Possible, Probable, or Definite by [CONTACT_093].  All AE analyses will be performed on TEAEs. All TEAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130] . 
The following will be summarized and presented for each treatment group: 
• The total number of TEAEs for each treatment group overall, by [CONTACT_49241], by 
[CONTACT_58277], the frequency of adverse events, the 
number of subject s with treatment emergent serious adverse events  (TESAEs ), and the 
number of subj ects with TEAEs leading to study discontinuation ;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE for each system organ class 
(SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE for each  preferred term (PT) 
in descending frequency;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE by [CONTACT_58278] (SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencin g a related TEAE for each system organ 
class (SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC;  
• A listing  of subjects experiencing a TESAE;  
• A listing  of subjects experiencing a TEAE leading to withdrawal ; and  
• A listing of subject deaths occurring on study and relatedness to TEAE . 
The incidence of TEAEs will be calculated by [CONTACT_58279] s in the treatment group . Thus, the incidence of 
TEAEs counts only the first occurrence of an event for each subject  in that treatment group that 
experiences the event, and does not represent the total number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_58263]. If a subject  has repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] a particular TEAE, only the most 
severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_58264], as 
appropriate, will be counted. 
A subject with more than one TEAE for a particular PT will be counted only once in the total of 
subjects experiencing TEAEs in that particular PT .  Likewise, a subject  with more than one type 
of TEAE in a particular SOC will be counted only once in the total of subjects experiencing

PT, SOC, severity of the event, relationship to study medication, onset date, resolution date, 
treatment given to treat the adverse event, the outcome, and whether the event was a TESAE.  
A listing of any subject deaths occurring on study will be p rovided. Deaths on study are those 
which occur after randomization but prior to early discontinuation or completion of study.  
10.8.[ADDRESS_63551] baseline value will be presented 
for the following selected laboratory parameters: a) alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, direct bilirubin, glucose, and 
cholesterol  for chemistry ; and b) hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, 
neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and platelet count for hematology. Urinalysis  data and 
pregnancy data will be listed only. In addition, all serum chemistry , hematology and urinalysis 
data outside the central laboratory standard reference ranges will be listed by [CONTACT_58280] . 
Individua l subject listings of clinical laboratory parameters at each visit will be provided. Values 
for any serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis values outside the central laboratory  
reference  ranges will be flagged on the individual subject  data listings.  
The following laboratory safety assessments will be included in the subject  listings: 
• Hematology : complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet counts. CBC includes 
red blood cells (RBCs), WBCs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume ( MCV), 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)  
• Serum chemistry : albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, BUN, calcium, chloride, 
bicarbonate (H CO 3), creatinine, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), 
glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total cholesterol, total protein, and uric acid  
• Urinalysis: inc luding determination of the presence of protein, glucose, ketones, occult blood,

10.8.4 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
The ECG data will be obtained directly from the [ADDRESS_63553] listings of physical examination results will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  
10.8.6 Pulmonary Function Tests  (PFT)  
Under Protocol Version 1, f or screening and b aseline PFTs, 3 PFTs will be performed on separate 
days during the screening period (within 5 weeks prior to dosing). The first of these tests will be performed before and after bronchodilator administration to determine if the subject  qualifies for 
the st udy, whereas the other [ADDRESS_63554]’s baseline value.  
Under Protocol Version 2 and later , for screening and baseline PFTs, 2 PFTs will be performed 
on separate days during the screening period (within 5 weeks prior to dosing) . The first of these 
tests will be performed before and after bronchodilator administration to determine if the subject qualifies for the study, whereas the other PFT  (performed without bronchodilator administration) 
will serve as the subject’s baseline value.  If the baseline PFT does not meet quality criteria, the 
pre-bronchodilator screening PFT (or repeat  pre-bronchodilator screening PFT, if appropriate) 
will be substituted as the baseline value.  
PFT parameters include:  
FVC:   forced (expi[INVESTIGATOR_696]) vital capacity  
FEV
1:  forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_58266]:   total lung capacity  
DLco/Hb:carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, corrected for hemoglobin 
RV:  residual volume 
The assessment of changes in lung function during this study will be performed by [CONTACT_58281] ’s follow -up PFT parameters (i.e., Visit 9 Day 29-MD and Visit 16 Day 8- FU visits) to 

Statistical Analysis Plan   CONFIDENTIAL  
 Sponsor Reference 203PF201  
Final  V2.0 : 23May [ADDRESS_63555]’s percent change from baseline will be calculated by [CONTACT_58282]’s baseline value from the v alue at the desired time point and then dividing 
this calculated value by [CONTACT_31031] ’s baseline value and multiplying by 100. The 
individual subject’s percent change from  the baseline value will be used to calculate the mean 
percent change from  baseline for the treatment group using a SAS procedure such as Proc 
Univariate.

summarize the change in the combination of honeycombing and reticulation (i.e., same, better, much better, worse, much worse, unknown). For the semi -quantitative  assessment, the extent of 
fibrosis including the extent of reticular abnormalities and honeycombing together will be scored for each lung separately as well as for both lungs combined using the following categories: absent, 1-25%, 26- 50%, 51-75%, 76-100%, or unknown. At the time of review the radiologists 
will also assess the HRCT images for technical adequacy and quality (i.e., noting anatomy that is not complete, motion artifacts present,  crucial anatomy is out of the f ield of view, other, etc.). 
Shift tables of the semi- quantitative HRCT assessments will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Individual subject listings of all HRCT and SLB eligibility assessments, as well as the qualitative and semi -quantitative HRCT safety assessments, will also be provided (including reviewer 
comments and consensus panel assessments). 
10.8.[ADDRESS_63562]  listings of O 2 saturation at 
each visit will be provided.  10.8.10 Immunogenicity (Anti -BG00011 Antibodies)  
Blood samples for potential antibodies to BG00011 will be collected during screening and prior to 
dosing on Visit [ADDRESS_63563]-dose samples will be obtained on Visit 19 Day 29-FU and 
Visit 85 Day 85- FU. 
Each blood sample will initially be tested for the presence of anti-BG00011 antibodies using a validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method . Confirmed positive samples using the 
screening assay will be titered and subsequently tested using a validated neutralization assay. 
Antibody results will be presented by [CONTACT_58288]. The incidence of 
antibodies to BG00011 (both binding as well as neutralizing)  will be tabulated over time by 
[CONTACT_2070] . The antibody titer and natural log transformed results 
will be summarized and  presented using descriptive statistics . If antibodies are present, their

Final  V2.0 : 23May [ADDRESS_63564] of clinical trials will determine whether dose escalation should proceed. The DSMB will be comprised of a biostatistician and two pulmonologists with expertise in interstitial lung diseases. The DSMB members’ responsibilities and the process for data reviews and dose- escalation are described in 
the DSMB Charter.  
Dose escalation will be based on the DSMB’s review of unblinded PK and safety data through Day 15 from the initial 4 (of 8) subject s administered BG00011 or placebo (3:1, respectively) in 
each cohort. Safety assessments will include a review of AEs, vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and pulse oximetry from these visits.

Serious adverse events will be provided to the DSMB on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Updated safety (including BAL, PFTs, and HRCT results) and PK information on all participants will be provided in each subsequent DSMB data package. For example, at the DSMB meetings for Cohorts [ADDRESS_63566] week 8 of the follow-up period (i.e., complete PK data through the dosing phase and follow-up BAL, PFT, and HRCT) for all participants in Cohorts [ADDRESS_63567] s with IP F.

 • A test for trend analysis will not be performed to assess the relationship between dose level 
and incidence of antibodies due to small sample sizes.  
• Many of the efficacy analyses described in Section 10.8 of SAP version 1.0 will not be 
performed under this SAP.  Additional analyses of gene expression data from serum or 
BAL will be provided in a separate report.  ETS1 and  tSMAD2 were added as biomarkers 
to analyze.  
• The “Efficacy” analysis population was renamed to the “Pharmacodynamic” population to 
more accurately reflect its purpose.  Also, only 1 injection of BG00011 will be necessary 
for part of the requirement to be included in this population, rather than the 5 injections noted in SAP version 1.0. 
• The PK methods and analysis will be described in a separate PK analysis plan .

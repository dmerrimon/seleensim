 Background  
Periodontal diseases are mainly the result of infections and inflammation of the gingiva and bone 
that surround and support the teeth.1 Bacterial accumulation in a biofilm (dental plaque) that 
coats the hard and soft tissues of the mouth is the primary causative agent for periodontal disease.
[ADDRESS_1152608] response, environmental factors ( e.g., smoking) and parafunctional habits (e.g. 
tooth grinding) can all influence the extent and severity of disease and its rate of progression.[ADDRESS_1152609] stage of disease.1 Patients with gingivitis exhibit classic signs of 
inflammation, including redness and swelling of the gum tissue, and blee ding upon periodontal 
probing and/or when performing daily oral hygiene. 2 Regular preventive dental care and proper 
daily oral hygiene techniques that effectively remove dental plaque can reverse gingivitis.  However, if left untreated, gingivitis may pro gress to periodontitis. 
2 Periodontal disease occurs 
more commonly in adults.  Approximately 47% of adults ages [ADDRESS_1152610] some form of periodontal disease, and prevalence increases with age.
3 Estimates are that 70% of older 
adults, ages [ADDRESS_1152611] been shown to be efficacious in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_830451], flossing and 
oral irrigation. 4,5 This  study investigate d the efficacy of an over the counter  (OTC) toothpaste 
and mouthrinse , both produced according to the FDA’s CFR21 monograph for products designed 
to reduce supragingival plaque and gingivitis, for reducing supragingival plaque, gingivitis, and 
bleeding on probing.  The products used in the study were ClōSYS® Sensitive Fluor ide 
Toothpaste, which contains 0.1% stabilized chlorine dioxide (sodium chlorite in an aqueous solution) and 0.13% w/v fluoride ion, and ClōSYS
® Sensitive  Rinse which contains 0.1% 
stabilized chlorine dioxide.  Early research supports the efficacy of stabi lized chlorine dioxide 
for reducing oral biofilm.6 A twice daily oral hygiene regimen using both products w as tested in 
adult subjects diagnosed with gingivitis and early periodontitis.  
 
Objective 
The purpose of the study was t o evaluate the efficacy of twice daily use of CloSYS Sensitive 
fluoride toothpaste and Sensitive  oral rinse on gingival bleeding upon probing and supragingival 
plaque in patients with gingivitis or periodontitis (Stage I or II).    
 
Study Design 
This wa s a 90-day, self -controlled, longitudinal, non- blinded clinical trial which measure d 
changes in clinical parameters in participants with gingivitis and Stage I or II periodontitis who 
applied CloSYS Sensitive fluoride  toothpaste twice daily with a toothbrush and CloSYS 
Sensitive  oral rinse twice daily after brushing.  Gingivitis was  defined as bleeding upon probing 
with no loss of attachment, and periodontitis wa s defined when loss of periodontal tissue support 
through inflammation is the primary feature.  
 The primary response variables w ere Subjects’ scores on the Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index 
(GI) and the number of sites with bleeding upon probing (BOP).  Probing depths and clinical attachment level w ere assessed at baseline and 3 months.  Adverse events  were assessed and 
documented at each visit.  In addition, Subjects w ere instructed to  keep a usage diary 
3 
 documenting their daily use of the toothpaste and oral rinse and any comments or observations 
regarding usage or adverse events.  
 
Number of Subjects  
The study w as conducted with  60 medically healthy participants between ages 18 to 80 years 
with gingiv itis or periodontitis (Stage I or II) who were receiving routine preventive care and/or 
periodontal maintenance at the Arizona School of Dentistry &  Oral Health, A.T. Still University 
in Mesa, Arizona.

 Screening   
Potential subjects w ere identified by [CONTACT_079] (PI) following chart review and 
recruited by [CONTACT_830462] (adult prophylaxis) or 
periodontal maintenance visit.  Potential subjects w ere then  evaluated by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_830452].   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_830453]. All patients’ 
periodontal status was assessed from periodontal charting and current radi ographs. Only patients 
without active periodontal disease were considered. 
 
Patients diagnosed with Stage I or II periodontitis who were now stable with ‘reduced 
periodontium’ and having regular periodontal maintenance were considered for inclusion. Once 
the clinical exam was completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_30647] a patient considered for acceptance 
into the study.  
 
During the screening visit, every potential subject w as interviewed and examined by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_830454] n/exclusion criteria.  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_830455], with risks and benefits of participation, and the subject w as given the opportunity to 
ask questions.   
a. Screening Interview:  The Subject w as asked about inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
demographics, smoking or non- smoking, and date of last professional dental cleaning 
(Appendix A: Screening Form). The following w ere also reviewed:  
i. Medical History and Medications:  A brief medical history for  each subject w as 
recorded.  
ii. Dental Health History: The Subject w as asked to report the date of their last 
professional cleaning.  Subjects w ere excluded if they have not had a professional 
cleaning within six months prior to the start of the study.  
b. Oral E xamination:   The Subject underwent  a periodontal examination for PD, CAL and 
BOP by [CONTACT_830463] (JB) as part of their professional cleaning visit. Subjects must have had at least [ADDRESS_1152614] w as determined, with eligibility confirmed if diagnosed as having gingivitis or 
5 
 periodontitis (Stages I and II).  Subjects also had to exhibit bleeding upon probing in 
>20% of sites. 
c. Enrollment Determination: 
a. Upon completion of the screening visit, the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_830456] d whether or not the potential Subject qualifie d for study 
enrollment.   
b. If the Subject qualifie d, the  baseline examination and prophylaxis were performed 
on the day of the screening examination. 
 Enrollment  
All Subjects who successfully complete d the screening w ere invited to participate.  At this time, 
written informed consent w as obtained.  The written informed consent document(s) were signed 
and personally dated by [CONTACT_830464] a fully executed informed consent document and processed per the institution’s standard operating procedures. A copy of the signed informed consent document w as provided to each subject upon request.   
 Subjects who were consented and enrolled in the study  were assigned a unique identification 
number (UIN)  which was  used to identify the Subject throughout the study and on all applicable 
study documentation related to that Subject.  Subjects’ UIN remain ed constant throughout the 
study.  
 Study Procedures     
Subjects who were enrolled in the study w ere scheduled for their Baseline appointment (Visit 1).   
 
A full periodontal examination was performed, including recording probing depths (PD ) and 
clinical attachment loss (CAL) at six sites per tooth for all teeth.  
 Bleeding on Probing (BOP) w as recorded as a dichotomous variable (present/absent) during the 
periodontal examination.  The percentage of sites with bleeding  was calculated by [CONTACT_830465].   
 
At the Baseline appointment (Visit 1, Day 0), the Subject had  a photograph taken of the ir mouth.  
The Gingival Index (GI) w as measured first  using  the Modified Gingival Index (MGI).7,8,9 The 
severity of gingival  inflammation  was recorded from the buccal, lingual and interproximal 
aspects of all evaluable teeth as follows:  
 
• Score 0 = absence of inflammation  
• Score 1 = mild inflammation  or with slight changes in color and texture but not 
in all portions of the gingival margin or papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387]  
• Score 2  = mild inflammation,  such as the preceding criteria, in all p ortions of 
the gingival margin or papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387]  
• Score 3 = moderate, bright surface inflammation, erythema, edema and/or 
hypertrophy of the gingival margin or papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387]  
• Score 4  = severe inflammation: erythema, edema and/or marginal gingival 
hypertrophy of the unit or spontaneous bleeding, papi[INVESTIGATOR_830457]  
6 
  
MGI scores were determined by [CONTACT_830466] 4 surfaces for each toot h present 
except for thir d molars , for a total of 28 teeth. The total number of teeth exhibiting inflammation 
affecting all portions of the gingival unit (Score ≥ 2) were noted at each visit. The total number 
of teeth affected was evaluated for each visit in the final analysis.  
 
Next, the Plaque Index (PI) w as recorded on all teeth except for third molars, as originally 
described by [CONTACT_830467] Löe.10,11   The PI [CONTACT_542640] s recorded  on 4 surfaces of each tooth and scored 
as follows:  
 
• Score 0 = No plaque  in gingival  area 
• Score  1 = No plaque  visible  by [CONTACT_830468], but plaque  is made  visible  on 
the point  of the probe after  it has been  moved across  surface  at entrance of  
gingival crevice.  
• Score  2 = Gingival  area is covered  with a thin to moderately  thick  layer  of 
plaque; deposit is visible to the naked eye  
• Score 3 = Heavy accumulation of soft matter, the thickness of which fills out 
niche produced by [CONTACT_830469]: interdental area is 
stuffed with soft debris  
 
To calculate the Plaque  Index (PI), the four scores were summed  for each tooth, and 
then all s cores for all  of the teeth present in a subject’s mouth  were added to determine a  
total score.  The n, the total score was then divided by [CONTACT_830470] e used in the final analysis.         
Results of the clinical indices were recorded on the approved data collection form by [CONTACT_978].  
 
Study products w ere then dispensed to the subject with both written and verbal instructions for 
use and the Diary Usage Form.   Toothpaste tubes and oral rinse bottles were weighed prior to dispensing, with weights recorded on the data collection form.  Dispensed products include d two 
32-ounce bottles of CloSYS Sensitive  oral rinse and two 7- ounce tubes of CloSYS Sensitive 
fluoride  toothpaste and disposable dosing cups.  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_392288] d both verbal and written oral 
hygiene instructions as follows:  
• Clean between the teeth using dental floss or a proxy brush  
• Brush with CloSYS Sensitive fluoride  toothpaste for 2 minutes twice daily .  Subjects 
were permitted to brush with either a manual or power toothbrush according to individual preference.  
• After brushing, rinse with 15 mL CloSYS Sensitive  oral rinse for 30 seconds, then 
expectorate.  Do not eat or drink for 30 minutes after rinsing.  
 Subjects also received a Diary Usage Form with instructions to complete the form daily.  Subjects document ed brushing and rinsing behaviors, including the time and date for each 
brushing/rinsing event.  Subjects w ere also instructed not to use any other oral care products than 
those given as part of the study during the entire study period. Subjects w ere instruct ed to bring 
back their toothpaste tubes and oral rinse bottles at each subsequent study visit along with the 
[ADDRESS_1152615] then  receive d an oral prophylaxis and was scheduled to return in 6 weeks for a 
follow -up study appointment (Visit 2). 
 Subjects returned for 2 additional study visits, scheduled every 45 days (Visit 2, Day 45; Visit 3, Day 90).   
 At Visit 2  (Day 45) , subjects  receiv ed photos  and MGI, PI.  The presence/absence of adverse 
events was assessed and documented. The completed Diary Usage Form and remaining products 
were collected , and products w ere weighed , with weights recorded on the data collection form .  
A new Diary form, one new tube of toothpaste, one new bottle of oral rinse and disposable 
dosing cups w ere dispensed with instructions to return the form and remaining products at the 
final study visit (Visit 3).    
 At Visit 3 (90 days), subjects receive d photos, MGI, PI, PD, CAL , BOP. Remaining products 
were collected and weighed , with weights recorded on the data collection form .  The Diary 
Usage Form w as also  collected.   The presence/absence of adverse events was assessed and 
documented.  Subjects com pleted a brief survey about their product use experience and 
preferences  (ease of use, taste, willing to continue regimen, willing to purchase) .  
 
The presence or absence of adverse events (yes/no) was documented at each study visit on the 
data collection form.  Adverse events that occurred were described and recorded by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_830458].  If indicated, photographs were taken and appropriate reporting was made 
to the ATSU IRB and Study Sponsor according to the study protocol and university policies.  
 For Visits 2 and 3, compliance was scored as a dichotomous variable (yes/no) .  Compliance was 
scored as “yes” if product weights decreased upon return and if self -reported product use 
according to the study protocol was completed 90% of the time  as documented on the returned 
Diary Usage Form.    At the end of the final study visit, each subject w ho completed the study in its entirety was  given 
a $[ADDRESS_1152616] for successful study completion.

Removal of Subjects  
Subjects  were given  the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to  receiving  future dental care at the institution .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_830459]/removal from the study and the reason for withdrawal/removal in the study record.   
If a subject experienced a complication  and wanted to withdraw , if they consent ed, they were 
scheduled for an immediate follow -up/closeout examination to determine if an adverse event wa s 
present, and if so, the causation of the adverse event w as recorded.  Every effort w as made to 
follow -up with s ubjects who withdr ew on their own from the study.  
 Subject data only up to the time when the subjects were withdrawn was kept but was not included in the data analysis o f the study.    
 
Off Study  
Subjects w ere considered off study when all planned study visits, early termination, and follow -
up visits were completed .  
 Study Outcomes  
This study assessed  differences i n clinical outcomes at baseline,  6 and 12 weeks. The primary 
outcomes include changes in gingival and plaque indices (GI and PI, respectively), and bleeding 
on probing.  Because enrolled subjects presented primarily with gingivitis, changes in pocket 
depth and  clinical attachment level w ere not included in the initial data analysis, as clinically , 
changes observed were negligible.  Secondary outcomes include d adverse events, compliance 
with the oral hygiene regimen and patient product use experience and preferences data.  
 
14.  Hypotheses  
The hypotheses for the study were as follows:  
• Subjects who apply CloSYS Sensitive fluoride t oothpaste and Sensitive  oral rinse as 
directed will experience reductions in PI [INVESTIGATOR_830460].  
•  Subjects who apply CloSYS  Sensitive fluoride  Toothpaste and Sensitive  oral rinse as 
directed will experience reductions in GI across time.  
• Subjects who apply CloSYS Sensitive fluoride  Toothpaste and Sensitive  oral rinse as 
directed will experience reductions in BOP across time.  
 
[ADDRESS_1152618] was used to compare 
differences in bleeding on probing (BOP) between baseline and [ADDRESS_1152619] use experience data were report ed using descriptive 
statistics.   All data w ere de-identified and reported in aggregate form only.

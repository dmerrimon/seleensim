Page [ADDRESS_740165] mechanism(s) 
underlying the development and maintenance of tinnitus remains largely unknown.  The C enter 
for Disease Control (CDC)  estimates over 50 million — nearly 15% of the general public —
experience some form of tinnitus  [9]. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome 
chronic tinnitus, w ith 2 million experiencing  extreme and debilitating symptoms  [9].   
Currently, there are no F ood and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved pharmacological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563366]. The 2014 Clinical Practice 
Guideline on tinnitus from the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery 
summarized the existing state of tinnitus management by [CONTACT_117580] “A cure for primary tinnitus 
does not yet exist, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_563367], no method has been proven to provide 
long-term suppression of tinnitus.” Existing treatment  methods largely focus on counseling, 
cognitive behavioral therapy, masking, and sound therapy for habituation – strategies that may 
render tinnitus more tolerable, but do not abolish the symptom.  
To date, the preponderance of research evaluating the feasibility of electrical stimulation for 
suppression of tinnitus comes from studies examining cochlear implantation and promontory 
stimulation  [7]. Cochlear implantation is currently the gold standard for rehabilitation of severe to 
profound sensorineural hearing loss and a demonstrated by[CONTACT_563379]. A recent review of the literature ev aluating the 
efficacy of cochlear implantation for treatment of tinnitus in patients with single -sided deafness 
reveals that tinnitus is improved in 82% to 100% of im plantees, abolished in 14% to 100% of 
implantees and none of the studies reported worsening of tinnitus during device use  [10]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_393635], cochlear implantation cannot be feasibly applied to patients 
with normal to moderate hearing loss, which  comprises  the majority of the population with 
tinnitus, since placement of an intracochlear  electrode commonly results in significant hearing 
loss or deafness.  
Promontory stimulation is an established otologic procedure that was initially developed as a 
diagnostic tool to assess patient candidacy for cochlear implantation. Promontory stimulation is 
most commonly performed in the outpatient setting on an awake pat ient by [CONTACT_1299] a single 
insulated probe through a topi[INVESTIGATOR_563368]. The safety and efficacy of transtympanic  promontory 
stimulation for the temporary relief of tinnitus in patients with normal hearing and varying 
degrees of hearing loss has recently been evaluated [3]. Overall, the literature supports that 
45% to 86% of subjects gain significant or complete suppression of tinnitus according to 
different measures and varying stimulation parameters. Furthermore, in most cases, electrical 
stimulation can be successfully a dministered with either no perception or only transient and 
minimal perception [4]. When evaluating the efficacy of tinnitus suppression according to 
underly ing etiology, it has been found that patients with acoustic trauma or noise -induced 
hearing loss had the highest success rates of tinnitus suppression compared to other etiologies 
such as presby[CONTACT_563380] Ménière's disease [5]. However, most patients only experience tinnitus 
suppression during and shortly after active electrical stimulation, with a smaller subset enjoying 
 
Page 5 of 13  
 residual inhibition for hours to days after treatment [5-6]. Thus, while successful at providing 
temporary reprieve, the method of transtympanic  promontory stimulation utilizing an external 
system does not provide a solution to manage chronic tinnitus. To suppress tinnitus long -term, 
patients must have access to continuous or repetitive electrical stimulation.  
From these data, the investigators hypothesize that a partially - or totally -implantable device, 
capable of administering electrical  stimulation via cochlear surface (i.e., promontory), will 
provide safe and effective long -term suppression of tinnitus in patients with normal to moderate 
sensorineural hearing loss. Paramount to the development of an implantable device, the 
optimum regio n(s) of device placement in relation to the cochlear turns (i.e., basal, mid, api[INVESTIGATOR_563369]) must be evaluated.  Placement of the electrode in the region of the 
posteroinferior promontory or at the round window can effectively stimulate the basal turn of the 
cochlea, which corresponds to high -frequency regions of the tonotopic map. In contrast, 
placement in the regio n of the anterosuperior cochlear surface, inferior to the cochleaform 
process for example, can stimulate the mid - and api[INVESTIGATOR_563370], which correspond 
to mid - and low -frequency regions of the cochlear tonotopic map. Several studies have 
demons trated successful electrical suppression of tinnitus through promontory stimulation in the 
region of the round window, while other studies have suggested that the region of optimal 
stimulation varies across subjects and more complete “cochlear coverage” is  beneficial [11].

 3   STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
Primary Objective : To characterize  the safety and efficacy of cochlear  promontory stimulation 
in the short -term relief of tinnitus.    
Hypothesis : Cochlear p romontory stimulation is  a safe procedure that provides short term 
tinnitus relief to a select subset of patients with chronic tinnitus.  
 
Secondary Objective : To determine the optimum region (s) of the cochlear promontory in 
planning for an implantable electrical device for long term tinnitus suppression .   
Hypothesis : Electrical suppression of tinnitus is dependent on the cochlear tonotopic map, with 
an optimum region for tinnitus suppression individualized to each patient.   
 
4   STUDY DESIGN  
4.1   General Design  
 
1. Experimental approach: adult patients with normal to moderate hearing loss and 
disruptive intractable asymmetric  tonal tinnitus will be recruited for electrical promontory 
stimulation testing.  
2. Candidate subjects will undergo a temporal bone Computed Tomography (CT) scan , 
contrast enhanced head Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI), audiogram with 
immittance testing, pi[INVESTIGATOR_563371], Distortion Product Otoacoustic 
Emissions ( DPOAE ) and Auditory Brainstem Response ( ABR) testing prior to 
promontory stimulation. Head MRI, DPOAE, audiogram and immittance testing are 
considered clinically routine for assessment of asymmetric  tinnitus. Temporal bone CT, 
ABR, tinnitus pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025] , level matching , masking levels and residual inhibition  testing are not 
standard clinical assessments for asymmetric  tinnitus. In addition, subjects will complete 
the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI),  Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Tinnitus 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) -L (loudness) and Tinnitus VAS -A (annoyance)  
questionnaires  three separate times  within the 10 days prior to promontory stimulation 
testing . Additional testing  for comorbid anxiety and depressive conditions  will be a 
screening Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8), 
and short Health Anxiety Inventory  (HAI-S). The  NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI ) will 
be administered to provide baseline information .  The initial session of promontory 
stimulation will define safety  stimulation parameters, with a continual treatment a fter 
defining these parameters . After treatment is completed , the patient will complete the  
THI, TFI, and Tinnitus VAS-A and Tinnitus VAS -L immediately prior to stimulation, during 
stimulation, and following completion of stimulation at 10 -minutes, 1 -hour, 24 -hours, 48 -
hours, and 1-week (or prior to the next scheduled stimulation treatment, whichever 
occurs first) following completion of stimulation. There will also be a “recall survey” in 
which patients will recall the time and feeling that their tinnitus felt in the week after the 
stimulation procedure.  In addition, pi[INVESTIGATOR_563372] . Each patient 
 
Page 7 of 13  
 will undergo three successive treatments separated by 7 days (+ 14/- 2 days) . Prior to 
each treatment, the patient will receive an audiogram and DPOAE testing to document 
interval safety. At the conclusion of the study, subjects will be asked about their 
willingness to undergo surgical implantation of a device capable of long -term scheduled  
or on -demand electrical stimulation for tinnitus suppression.   
4.2   Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary study endpoints include  tinnitus relief  based upon questionnaires and tinnitus 
matching , tactile and auditory feedback, and the perception of discomfort during stimulation .   
4.3   Secondary Study Endpoint s 
The secondary study endpoint s include  determining  treatment parameters  of the cochlea r 
promontory  for maximum tinnitus suppression .   
 
4.4   Early termination  
If during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_563373] , the study protocol will be revisited and re -written or the study will be terminated.  
4.5 Risk / Benefits  
Benefit : We propose a study evaluating short term suppression of tinnitus  with t he information 
accumulated to aid in the development of a future implantable device capable of providing long 
term tinnitus suppression.   
Risk : There is a 1.6% risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation ; the risk of perforation 
requiring intervention is 0.5%  [13].  The risk of  electrical current spread on the surface of the 
promontory could theoretically cause facial nerve stimulation, discomfort through stimulation of 
the tympanic plexus, or hearing loss.  CT scans involve exposure to radiation. The amount of 
radiation from these studies has a low risk of harmful effects.

including consultants, residents, audiologists, and nurses will be made aware of this study’s 
inclusion and exclusion criteria and will identify appropriate patients.  Consent to participate in 
the study will be obtained at the time of consultation.   Alternatively, subjects may be contact[CONTACT_563385], with the potential of being 
consented by [CONTACT_563386] r signing the consent form electronically or by [CONTACT_2319], if the 
subject can’t or doesn’t want to sign electronically.

If the patient is unable to schedule a Pre Visit Evaluation, consent may then be mailed (either 
via the postal service or electronically  through PTRAX ) to the patient.  The consenting provider 
will meet with the patient by [CONTACT_563387] .  If desire to proceed, signed consent form will be returned either 
electronically or by [CONTACT_563388].   The THI,

screening surveys which will be scored, and if the scores qualify, the subject will come in person 
for a clinical visit  and the rest of the initial screening surveys, if they did not do the whole set at 
home .  
After eligibility is determined, subject will complete study  questionnaires (THI , TFI, and Tinnitus 
VAS-A and VAS -L) at three separate time periods in conjunction with  the first clinical visit.   
6.[ADDRESS_740169] enhanced head MRI, audiogram with immittance testing, pi[INVESTIGATOR_563375], and DPOAE and ABR testing prior to promontory stimulation. If 
during the course of the patient’s visit, any of the exclusion criteria are met, the patient 
will be withdrawn from the study, and will be notified of this as soon as possible. If the 
patient has already had a temporal bone CT and/or a head MRI, they do not need to get 
another for this study.  
a. The number and estimated length of each study visit  
 
Page [ADDRESS_740170] visit would include a ~30 minute overview . The 
next visit would require  ~[ADDRESS_740171], ~[ADDRESS_740172] , ~45 min ABR, ~45 min audiogram and DPOAE, ~30-60 min of 
stimulation.  The next 2 visits would require ~30-[ADDRESS_740173] visit would require ~20 min for tympanic membrane evaluation for 
residual perforation  and ~[ADDRESS_740174] clinical appointment, the promontory stimulation 
equipment (Cochlear Corporation Nucleus Promontory Stimulator Z10012®; 
Cochlear Corporation, Melbourne, Australia) will be used. The initial session of 
promontory stimulation will define optimal  stimulation parameters (i.e., current 
level, and frequency ), where maximal tinnitus suppression occurs with minimal or 
no auditory percept. Stimulus amplitude will be increased slowly to establish 
threshold and maximum acceptable loudnes s.  As an internal control function, 
testing will include a run of “on-off” simulations  blinded to the  subject , with patient 
blinded status to the “off” or “on” position of the stimulation machine.  After these 
parameters are established, the patient will complete the THI , TFI,  and VAS 
immediately prior to stimulation, during stimulation, and following completion of 
stimulation at 10 -minutes, 1 -hour, 24 -hours, 48 -hours, and 1 -week following 
completion of stimulation  (or prior to the next scheduled session o f promontory 
stimulation , whichever occurs sooner) , in addition to the recall survey, which is 
completed after a time period of one week  (or prior to the next scheduled session 
of promontory stimulation , whichever occurs sooner) . In addition, pi[INVESTIGATOR_563376] . Each patient will undergo three 
successive treatments separated by 7 days (+ 14/- 2 days) . Prior to each 
treatment, the patient will receive an audiogram and DPOAE testing to document 
interval safety. At the conclusion of the study, subjects will be asked about their 
willingness to undergo surgical implantation of a device  capable of long -term 
scheduled  or on -demand electrical stimulation for tinnitus suppression.  
b. The Cochlear Corporation Nucleus Promontory Stimulator Z10012 (Cochlear 
Corporation, Melbourne, Australia) will deliver stimulatory electric pulses. The 
stimulation will be delivered to the target sites using a transtympanic electrode 
kit, which contains a monopolar transtympanic needle electrode referenced to a 
surface electrode to be placed on the patient’s forehead. The tympanic 
mem brane will be visualized with otomicroscopy  with the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. Phenol will be applied to the tympanic membrane for local anesthesia. If 
residual irritation is perceived, EMLA cream will be used in the external auditory 
canal.  The transtympanic electrode needle will be guided through the external 
canal aiming for the posteroinferior quadrant of the tympanic  membrane . The 
needle will be stabilized in the ear canal using cotton packing  or hearing aid mold 
putty  and adhesive tape. Initially, an electrode impedance test will be performed 
 
Page [ADDRESS_740175] imulation 
parameters for the therapeutic session wil l be carried out  using a ranged of 0 to 1 
mA for pulse frequencies 100 Hz,  800 Hz  and 1600 Hz. For each stimulus 
frequency, current level will be gradually increased to determine the following 
perceptual parameters: 1) Detection threshold  or minimum threshold : first 
detection of the electrical stimulus (tactile or audible) as reported by [CONTACT_102]. 
2. Maximum acceptable loudness level  or discomfort level : when the applied 
current is perceived as loud but not uncomfortable.  3. The effective  stimulation 
level will be determined to be 80% of the discomfort level or at minimum the 
minimum threshold level . The total duration of the electrical stimulation (at the 
optimal level) in each session will be ~30-60 minutes.  
6.2.2 ABR  
a. A threshold ABR using a 37.7 rate click stimulus  will be used for auditory brainstem 
response testing . 
6.2.3 DPOAEs  
a. DPOAEs will be tested 1 -10 kHz.  Presence of DPOAEs will be determined using the 
following criteria: 6 dB SNR; absolute level of >= -[ADDRESS_740176].  A member of the study team  will help organize the administration and receipt of 
surveys, as well as coordinate appointment visits.  They will allot for breaks in between separate 
tests for patient comfort.   
 
7   DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS  
7.1   Data to Be Collected  
 
Page 13 of 13  
 Demographic data to be collected will include patient’s age, sex, medical comorbidities,  current 
medications and medications taken within the last year, preoperative THI, TFI, Tinnitus VAS-A 
and VAS -L, GAD7, PHQ8, GHQ  and NEO PI -R. 
  
The patient will complete the THI , TFI and Tinnitus VAS-A and VAS -L immediately prior to 
stimulation, during stimulation, and following completion of stimulation at 10 -minutes, 1 -hour, 
24-hours, 48 -hours, and 1 -week (or prior to the next scheduled session of promontory 
stimulation, whichever occurs sooner) following completion of stimulation.   
 
7.2 Data Analysis  
 
a Power Analysis  
Assuming the power was 80% and a one sided alpha of .05 ; we sought to determine a 
power analysis to detect a clinically significant decrease in tinnitus symptoms  [3,12] . 
True Change in 
THI SD of Change 
of THI  Sample Size  
  Equality  Superiority 
using [ADDRESS_740177] only examines that, if the true change 
is 7 (10), it is different from zero.   
The second two analyses seek to quantify  the amount of change in THI we would like to 
consider clinically relevant. If we believe a clinically relevant change is [ADDRESS_740178] to consider 
the treatment a success, with requiring only a 5 point change to be clinically relevant (the 
threshold for not improving in the paper above).   
 
Page [ADDRESS_740179] a mean change greater than 7 we would need 24 subjects.   
b Data Analysis  
 
THI, TFI and Tinnitus VAS scores will be analyzed based on numeric change over time after 
each promontory stimulation procedure.  Data from the Audiograms / DPOAE will be assessed 
to ensure no baseline change in hearing has occurred as safety precautionary measures.

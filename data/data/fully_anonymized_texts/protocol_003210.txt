1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims 
Preterm birth and complications in term births increase infant morbidity and mortality. Premature rupture 
of membranes, intrauterine or systemic infection, diabetes, fetal-maternal hemorrhage and abruption 
lead to fetal distress and preterm delivery or hypoxia ischemia at term birth. These conditions result in 
increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage, global hypoxia-ischemia (HIE), arterial stoke, and 
neuroinflammation with white matter injury in newborns of all gestational ages (GA).1-[ADDRESS_111713] 12 months,  that 
presage hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) .  
Early targeted therapy interventions for high-risk infants aim to improve neurological outcomes by 
[CONTACT_101196].4,5 Intensive interventions, such as constraint-
induced movement therapy (CIMT), are designed to ameliorate early motor predecessors of CP in at-
risk infants.6-[ADDRESS_111714] to use non-invasive transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) paired 
with a motor task of bottle-feeding in infants with feeding failure. taVNS paired with motor feeding 
activity was safe and over 50% 16,17 infants determined to need a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) attained 
full oral feeds (mean time to full oral feeds 15 days with once daily, and 7.8 days with twice daily 
treatment). With our unique collaboration of experts in brain stimulation, pediatric translational 
clinical science and pediatric occupational therapy in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], we are one of the few groups 
able to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_101155].  
We propose to expand the paradigm of pairing neuromodulation with motor training in at-risk infants 
by [CONTACT_101197], feasibility, and effectiveness of delivering taVNS concurrently with 
CIMT. Our hypothesis is that combining taVNS with intensive CIMT may boost neuroplasticity, 
allowing for delivery of infant therapy at a minimally effective dosage (40h)13 while improving infant 
outcomes.  
Aim 1: To determine the feasibility and safety of taVNS in at-risk infants 6-18mo undergoing CIMT 
therapy in open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. We will assess the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s ability to deliver high-quality CIMT 
while delivering taVNS stimulation by [CONTACT_101198][INVESTIGATOR_101156] (20% sessions) with a CIMT fidelity measure we and others have used in CIMT studies.[ADDRESS_111715] in 6-18month old infants with unilateral motor weakness that taVNS paired with intensive 
CIMT will be safe and well tolerated and can be delivered with good fidelity by [CONTACT_101199][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 
Aim 2: To generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_101157] 40h CIMT + taVNS stimulation in: 1) upper 
extremity motor abilities, 2) gross motor skills, and 3) individual treatment goals.  
We expect infant motor skills to improve with 40h CIMT+ taVNS, from before to the end of treatment, 
with maintenance of motor skill gains at 3months after completion of CIMT (n=5 complete the course 
of CIMT+taVNS). 
Jenkins, Coker-Bolt   Version 3  3/3/[ADDRESS_111716] application combining neuromodulation and the proven intervention of CIMT in infants. 
We need to show feasibility and generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_28185] a small number of patients prior to submission of 
an NIH proposal on pairing taVNS and CIMT for rehabilitation of infant s with hemiplegia after 
perinatal brain injury (see Ramey Letter of Support). This application expands our success with our 
previous NM4R pi[INVESTIGATOR_50522], which culminated in a taVNS infant system designated as an FDA 
Breakthrough Device. We will use this device in a completely unexplored area of neuromodulation, that 
of taVNS paired with intensive CIMT rehabilitation in young infants. Our goal with this combination 
neuromodulatory strategy is to decrease the severity of clinical deficits in infants, to improve day-to-day 
living, ameliorate life-long motor deficits, and help both the child and their families.

efficacious protocols use dosage between 60-120 treatment hours,9,13 within a condensed time period, 
frequently multi-hour sessions daily for 4weeks. There is substantial evidence that such intensive 
therapeutic bursts (e.g., many hours each day on multiple consecutive days across multiple weeks) 
create opportunities for the development of increased motor and functional skills in infants with early 
motor delays. Thus, activity-dependent neuroplasticity is reinforced through intense repetition.12 
However, these early intensive therapy models are difficult to accomplish in many households.11  
There is evidence that even with significant brain injury, neuromodulation via vagus nerve stimulation 
(VNS) delivered during a motor task can harness activity-dependent plasticity and lead to improved, 
near-normal outcomes.17-[ADDRESS_111718] motor cortical plasticity involved in motor tasks, with better function 
in a shorter time. 
The data in animals and humans support the premise that both cervically-implanted and transcutaneous 
auricular VNS paired with motor rehabilitation improve functioning.18--32 In rats, cervically-implanted 
VNS paired with movement led to a doubling in size of the primary motor cortex associated with the 
movement.18 In adult stroke patients, upper extremity Fugl–Meyer scores significant increase with 
VNS-paired rehabilitation vs rehabilitation alone.25,-27 An FDA pi[INVESTIGATOR_101158]-VNS for adult 
stroke ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 31 is reporting clinically and statistically significant functional improvement

 with active vs sham VNS paired with rehabilitation. Similar results are being obtained with non-
invasive VNS by [CONTACT_101200] a 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device.16,17, 30-32 An ongoing MUSC COBRE trial 
is also using taVNS-paired with upper limb rehabilitation in adult stroke patients (Badran, PI; NCT 
04129242). In infants, TENS devices are FDA-approved for pain management. TENS serves as the 
basis for the Soterix Medical taVNS unit used in our infant feeding trial and this proposed study. We 
have conducted safety and feasibility trials of taVNS in infants with oromotor disability due to 
perinatal brain injury and observed no minor or major adverse effects.16,17 Our work validates 
parameters for delivering taVNS, suggesting that two-minute taVNS periods at 500μs, 25Hz, and 
slightly less than perceptual threshold (PT) are safe, tolerable and produce changes in white matter 
microstructure consistent with neuroplasticity in infants.16,17, 33-35 (see preliminary data) 
Activation of afferent vagal fibers in the dorsal nucleus and locus coeruleus along with an associated 
stimulus, results in secretion of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], a high-alert signal that helps activate motor to 
hippocampal pathways and re-establish normal connections. [CONTACT_101228] has shown via fMRI that 
taVNS also activates key sensorimotor targets in adults, including thalami and basal ganglia that are 
also key areas of perinatally acquired CNS injury.33 We also changes in white matter microstructure 
consistent with neuroplasticity in infants following taVNS-paired feeding (preliminary data). Thus, a 
non-invasive taVNS approach may be particularly effective in infants who manifest early motor 
disabilities due to perinatal brain injury and whose developmental and reparative plasticity is greater 
than for adults.[ADDRESS_111719] neuroplasticity and allow for delivery of intensive 
therapy at a minimal dosage of 40h while improving infant outcomes. Ultimately CIMT pairing with 
taVNS may be used in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic or home setting to improve motor dysfunction, reduce the 
incidence or severity of hemiplegic CP, and decrease financial and emotional costs of caring for a child 
with motor disability. This would significantly improve the quality of life for these children with 
disabilities. Importantly, this noninvasive technology may be effective in rehabilitation, even when 
other neuroprotective treatments are not available, as many conditions leading to motor disorders in 
infants are unpredictable or unavoidable . Significance of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_101159]:  
• We will generate pi[INVESTIGATOR_101160]. 
• A collaborative, innovative multidisciplinary team will execute these proposed studies, including [CONTACT_101229]-Bolt an expert in infant CIMT and taVNS expert (Badran). 
• The infant taVNS system for this study allows the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101161]-based CIMT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
INNOVATION 
Application of neuromodulation to perinatally acquired brain injury is innovative. Activity-dependent 
plasticity that is enhanced by [CONTACT_101201].16,[ADDRESS_111720] 
Gillick’s group in older children and adults with cerebral palsy.14,[ADDRESS_111721]. George, 
and non-invasive transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) was developed by [CONTACT_6283]. Badran and George. 
With the collaboration of brain stimulation experts, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], neuroradiologists, and a 
neonatal clinical translational investigator, we are the first to use taVNS in infants and neonates .16,17 
In our infants with brain dysmaturity or overt brain injury, we postulated that neuromodulation with 
non-invasive taVNS may positively influence abnormal circuits to improve neuronal connectivity and 
neuroplasticity and improve oromotor skills. Importantly, taVNS was well accepted by [CONTACT_101202]. 
Jenkins, Coker-Bolt   Version 3  3/3/[ADDRESS_111722] a positive influence on early motor abilities and hand 
function,13,36-39 but current models continue to require 60-120 hours of intensive therapy, including 
the recently funded Intensive Infant Rehabilitation (I-ACQUIRE, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) Phase III Clinical 
Trial. These intensive therapy models raise challenges for parents juggling the family’s daily 
schedule.11 Using two innovative and potentially effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101162], we aim to 
decrease the time commitment and improve outcomes.  
Overview of Innovation: This proposal will use the following innovative techniques and goals 
• A novel, portable, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-triggered taVNS system that can be used during CIMT sessions 
• A novel cohort of older infants with unilateral weakness who are referred to CIMT therapy 
• Safety and feasibility of taVNS paired with CIMT  
• Assessment of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101163] a CIMT fidelity tool [ADDRESS_111723] perinatally acquired 
brain injury with CIMT+ taVNS to improve motor skills or developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a similar treatment paradigm. 
 
Preliminary data from pi[INVESTIGATOR_101164]-
paired feeding, who were refractory to standard of care early feeding interventions and were slated to 
receive a G-tube. We obtained IRB approval with medical device designation of non-significant risk for 
this open- label trial with parental consent. 
Inclusion Criteria of previous taVNS feeding trial: Infants born ≤ 33 completed weeks gestation, or 
with brain injury (HIE); clinically stable; failing oral feeding; clinical team discussing need for G-tube with 
parents. 
Exclusion Criteria of taVNS feeding trial: Cardiomyopathy, significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_101165] : Increase in total daily oral feeding volumes compared before and 
during treatment, achievement of full oral feeds (>130ml/kg/d with weight gain), avoiding G-tube. 
Secondary Efficacy outcomes : Brain changes measured by [CONTACT_101203] (DKI) in white matter 
tract (WM) integrity before and after taVNS-paired feeding, normalized for weeks of development. 
Improvement in overall motor function by [CONTACT_101204] (STEP).40 
Primary Safety Outcomes : Bradycardia (HR<80bpm for 5 seconds), as potential effect of taVNS 
on the dorsal nucleus and efferent cardiac vagus nerve fibers; skin irritation; Change >3 points in the 
Neonatal and Infant Pain scale (NIPS).41,42 
Treatment Protocol :  
• taVNS pulses delivered via a left ear electrode at 25Hz, 
pulse width 500µseconds . 
• Perceptual threshold (PT) determined by [CONTACT_101205]. 
• taVNS delivered at 0.1mA < PT, paired with suck-
swallowing during one (n=15) or two (n=18) oral 
feedings per day, for 2-4 wks.

 Efficacy outcomes: To date, 19/35 
infants destined for G-tube attained full 
oral feeds with taVNS paired feedings 
(54% Responders). taVNS Responders 
showed a significant increase in mean 
daily po volumes vs Non-Responders 
who received G-tube (p<0.05). We also 
demonstrate a dose response with 
greater increase in slopes of daily po 
feeding volumes (F, 8.05, p=0.01, Fig. 
2A) and shorter time to full po feeds 
(p<0.05, Fig. 2B) in twice vs once daily 
treatments. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes: dMRI before 
and after taVNS treatment, shows white matter 
plasticity changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) that 
are significantly greater for Responders versus Non-
Responders in corpus callosum and external 
capsule, per week of development ( Fig. 3). Both 
groups showed greater than normal FA increase, 
compared with published normal developmental 
changes (indicated by [CONTACT_101207]).43   
Target attainment: Transient HR 
decrease was reliably demonstrated 
within 30sec of taVNS onset, with a 
quick rebound in 60sec. The HR 
decrease was reproducible within and 
across individuals. Fig. [ADDRESS_111724]. 
Fig. 5 shows significantly lower HR 
during onset of taVNS-paired feeds 
compared with pre-feed, and no HR change 
during control feeds without stimulation. 
Safety outcomes: We observed no bradycardia (HR<80bpm 5sec) & no skin irritation. Persistent increase 
in discomfort scores NIPS >3 occurred in 3 of 228 sessions (1.3%) and resolved with decreasing current. 
In summary, our first in human neonate and infant pi[INVESTIGATOR_101166], using our custom taVNS system, showed safety and feasibility, and achieved encouraging 
results in >50% of infants slated for G-tube achieving full oral feeds in [ADDRESS_111725] this proposal:  We recently received Breakthrough Device designation 
from the FDA for the Baby[CONTACT_101208], which is similar to the system proposed in this application. Our 
phase I STTR early RCT with the Baby[CONTACT_101209] (Jenkins, Badran, MUSC FRD Accel), received a 
favorable score from NICHD STTR study section with notification of probable funding after council review.

3.0 Intervention to be studied  
 
Proposed Trial of CIMT Paired with taVNS 
We will treat up to 10 infants referred for CIMT with one-sided motor weakness to receive active taVNS 
paired with 40 hours of CIMT. We will perform infant motor assessments before and after the treatment is 
completed to answer the following questions: 
1) Is taVNS feasible and safe of in infants 6-18months of age undergoing CIMT therapy? 
2) Does infant motor ability increase with low-dosage 40h CIMT + active taVNS as measured by: 1) 
upper extremity motor abilities, 2) gross motor skills, and 3) individual treatment goals. 
Experimental set-up: For this proposal we will modify our Baby[CONTACT_101209], which uses the FDA 
cleared Soterix taVNS unit, Neolead® electrode in front of the tragus and custom ear electrode for 
infant sized ears, wired trigger control of stimulation with a trigger button or direct input in the 
Soterix taVNS unit. We will substitute a portable, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-triggered taVNS system with hand held 
trigger button as seen in Figure 6. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101167] a hand-held button for 2min-on/[ADDRESS_111727] an established, collaborative, innovative multidisciplinary team to execute these proposed 
studies. In addition to MUSC’s infant taVNS trial, Drs. Jenkins and Coker-Bolt have been collaborating 
for [ADDRESS_111728] case report on successful implementation of CIMT in infants under 
one year of age.37 
Working with development, perhaps activating critical motor synapses, taVNS paired with CIMT could 
deliver groundbreaking innovation in the increasing problem of unilateral motor weakness in infants with 
perinatally acquired brain injury.

 Aim 1. To determine the feasibility and safety of taVNS in 6-18mo infants with unilateral motor 
weakness undergoing CIMT therapy in an open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. The CIMT therapy sessions will be 
videotaped and a random weekly session (20% sessions) will be scored for CIMT treatment fidelity 
while the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101168]. [CONTACT_47268]-Bolt will score these using a CIMT fidelity scoring 
system previously used in other studies.[ADDRESS_111729] while delivering high quality CIMT. 
Aim 1 Procedures:   
1) We will follow the following protocol for CIMT paired with taVNS with one OT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101169] a brain stimulation research assistant (BSL-RA) supervising the delivery of taVNS: 
2) Hydrogel electrodes are placed in front of tragus, and inner tragus/cymba chonchae, securing the wires 
behind head with tape, and placing wire under shirt. 
3) CIMT and BSL therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101170] (PT) daily, increasing +0.1mA, until 
infant shows signs of tingling sensation. 
4) We will treat with stimulation at 0.1mA<PT, 500µsec, 25Hz, during each CIMT session. 
5) The OT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101171] a continuous 2min-
on, 30sec-off program (similar to taVNS-feeding settings16,17), while administering CIMT. Trigger 
button is off for rest. 
6) Impedance is constantly displayed on the Soterix unit ( good, moderate  or poor). If contact [CONTACT_101210], a 
beep alerts the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101172].  
7) Both parent and OT will be queried by [CONTACT_101211], 
infant tolerance, general acceptance and any recommendations for improvement of taVNS delivery 
during the 4 weeks of CIMT therapy.

constraint mitt will only be worn during the therapy sessions. 36-[ADDRESS_111730]  Highly trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101173] 38 will use 
immediate and varied reinforcement, primarily verbal praise, smiles, and supportive 
gestures, to sustain the infant’s attention, engagement, and enjoyment, then “shape”

strength, fluency (coordination), and speed, using technique of 
“successive approximations”. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101174] a “MR3 cycle,” of

CIMT Sessions will actively engage the infant to initiate, attempt, repeat, practice, and

the more-impaired arm and hand. Emphasis will be on engagement of the infant and 
the affected upper extremity in age - appropriate activities in positions of supi[INVESTIGATOR_050],

Technical administration of taVNS: The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101175]. 1) We will provide training sessions for the single designated CIMT 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101176], and 2) the BSL RA will supervise and 
assist with taVNS treatments with each patient session. The brain stimulation RA will be trained to deliver 
stimulation, place the ear electrode for good impedance readings, and demonstrate this with [CONTACT_101230] or 
Badran prior to supervising the CIMT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. We have several RAs who are experienced in infant taVNS 
who may also supervise any new RAs in the procedures. As part of this training, we have an instructional 
video for setting up the taVNS system with an infant. 
Limitations and alternative approaches : The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101177] a different trigger switch 
is needed or a different program with a ‘2min on-30sec-off’ loop that does not require pressing the button 
repeatedly. We will then incorporate this feedback in our next design of the trigger. Previous NIH reviewers 
of our similar Soterix-based Baby[CONTACT_101213] I were concerned about overstimulation, requesting a 
fail-safe stop time for each trigger. We are using the same infant-modified Soterix taVNS unit, and for 
establishing safety in this CIMT+taVNS pi[INVESTIGATOR_101178] 2min-on, 30sec-off.  For 
safety the taVNS unit limits deliverable microcurrent is limited to a maximum of 2mA, which is sufficient 
for adults to register a tingling. Feasibility of using wired ear electrodes:  The infant should be engaged 
during CIMT such that the ear electrode does not irritate the infant. If the first infant does not tolerate the 
ear electrode, we will train infants on the electrode by [CONTACT_101214], to get the infant used to ignoring the presence of the electrode. The electrode 
should not impact hearing during the session. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_101179] a hearing screen before 
discharge, all infants passed the screen except one, and that infant failed the hearing screen before taVNS 
treatment was initiated. No hearing adverse events were noted in that pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  
Feasibility of delivering high fidelity CIMT with taVNS: We expect the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101180]. If the BSL RA has 
to assist in most therapy sessions after week 1, we will troubleshoot any sticking points and retrain the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101181]. If the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101182] [ADDRESS_111731] efficiency with the taVNS system during CIMT.  
 
Aim 2: To measure infant response to low-dosage 40h CIMT + active taVNS stimulation (n=5) in: 1) upper 
extremity motor abilities, 2) gross motor skills, 3) individual treatment goals before and at the end of CIMT 
treatment. We will assess motor skills at 3mo after completion of CIMT for maintenance of gains. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_111732] and parents develop a practical written plan to maintain gains made 
during the CIMT program. The plan will involve motor skills and functional 
activities appropriate for the infant’s age at discharge from the program.

 Aim 1: Primary CIMT feasibility outcomes : Ability of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101183] a meeting or exceeding score (3 or 4) on random videotaped therapy sessions, as scored by 
[CONTACT_101215].  
Aim 1: Primary taVNS safety and feasibility outcomes : Ability of infant to tolerate wired ear electrode 
and for electrode to remain securely in place with good contact [CONTACT_101216]; 
<5% of sessions with sustained discomfort requiring decreasing current.  
Aim 2: Primary Efficacy Outcome : We will use the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST) 
subtests for grasp and dissociated movement as our primary outcome. The QUEST is a reliable, valid, 
quantitative outcome measure with excellent psychometric properties, and is recommended by 
[CONTACT_66645]/NICHD for the evaluation of movement patterns and hand function in children with cerebral 
palsy.[ADDRESS_111733] been used in published infant CIMT trials,8 
and provide detailed information on hand function and quality of movement between the right and left 
sides of the body. 
Aim 2: Secondary Efficacy Outcomes : We will use three other assessments for fine and gross motor 
function and meeting individual treatment goals: Developmental Assessment of Young Children (DAYC), 
the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66) and the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS).  
• The DAYC is a standardized assessment of early developmental skills from birth to 5 years of age50 
and is recommended for early detection of CP.51 We will use the DAYC Physical Development domain 
to assess developmentally appropriate fine and gross motor skills. [Mean (SD)=100±15 for each 
domain.] 
• We will use the GMFM-66 as a comprehensive evaluation of foundational gross motor skills to assess 
how much of a task the infant can do rather than the quality of motor performance.48,52,53 Specific 
sections tested include Dimensions (A) Lying & rolling, (B) Sitting, (C) Crawling & kneeling, (D) 
Standing. 52,53 
• The GAS is an individualized outcome measure that is standardized in order to calculate the extent to 
which a patient or group of patients’ therapy goals are met.54,55 We will set individual goals for each 
infant and use the GAS scale to analyze differences between before and after CIMT+taVNS. 
 
5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/ Study Population 
 
 Inclusion Criteria: Infants, 6-18 months old with hemiplegia/motor asymmetry who 
qualify for CIMT, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level I-IV (a 
validated classification system with 5-levels that describe the gross motor function of 
children with cerebral palsy based on their self-initiated movements, in sitting, walking and 
mobility).48 Prior CIMT therapy will be allowed if the infant has not had CIMT in the 
preceding 3 months.  
 Exclusion Criteria: GMFCS level V,48 severe motor impairment/quadriplegic involvement; 
uncorrected blindness or deafness, cardiomyopathy. CIMT therapy within the prior [ADDRESS_111734] 5 completed courses of CIMT+taVNS.  
 
7.0 Setting 
CIMT treatment sessions will occur in College of Health Professions (CHP) pediatric therapy lab 
located in the CHP B Building at [ADDRESS_111735].  
 
Jenkins, Coker-Bolt   Version 3  3/3/[ADDRESS_111736] IRB approval for two pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (#[ZIP_CODE], #103800) in preterm and term stroke/HIE infants 
with taVNS paired with feeding using similar taVNS study procedures as proposed in this application. 
The taVNS system has a non-significant risk device designation from MUSC’s IRB in these two pi[INVESTIGATOR_101184].  
 
[CONTACT_101230] will screen for infants in the nursery with known brain injury that will likely lead to 
hemiparesis or weakness, such as perinatal arterial stroke, HIE, severe IVH, PVL or cerebellar infarct, 
regardless of sex or race. The clinical team will inform the parents of the potential to participate in the 
study. [CONTACT_101230] will then explain the study to the parents and give them contact [CONTACT_101217], to initiate screening and consent procedures when their infant reaches 6-8months of age. Infants 
are also referred directly to [CONTACT_47268]-Bolt and McGloon specifically for CIMT from a wide region of the 
southeast. Because some parents travel great distances to get these services, we may obtain referrals from 
other care providers out of our region.  We will perform phone screening and obtain Econsent prior to 
patient arrival for patients whose parents cannot meet in person prior to the first treatment session, to be 
able to get services fully prepared for the visit. We will use the approved REDcap system to obtain consent. 
[CONTACT_101230] or other approved study personnel will go over the entire consent document on the phone with 
the parent to ensure comprehension and to confirm identity. Parent will be given a copy of the completed, 
signed consent form in person or by [CONTACT_71345]. 
 
Volunteers of all ethnicities and racial categories will be accepted into this study protocol. No preference 
will be given based on race, gender or ethnicity. Young infants who had perinatal complications leading 
to perinatally acquired brain injury may be considered vulnerable populations and are the target of this 
proposal. 
 
The parents of infants who present for CIMT are highly motivated, and willing to commit to the time and 
effort commitment for CIMT. Most of the study procedures occur during the active treatment period. 
Therefore, we anticipate >95% retention to completion of the immediate outcome measures. For the 3 
months follow-up assessment, we will call every month to discuss infant progress with the 
mother/caregiver. All of these infants will also have regular developmental follow-up in MUSC’s or other 
high-risk clinic, and we will collect this data with parent consent, though it is not part of the primary or 
secondary outcomes for the phase I trial. 
 
9.0 Consent Process 
Drs. Jenkins, Coker-Bolt, or McGloon (PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Investigators) will explain the study to these parents by 
[CONTACT_101218]. Based on our 87% consent rate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_101185]-feeding 
study, and the ready parental acceptance of taVNS, we anticipate no significant parental concerns that 
would impact enrollment. We will not have a Spanish language consent. 
We will perform phone screening and obtain eConsent prior to patient arrival for patients whose parents 
cannot meet in person prior to the first treatment session, to be able to get services fully prepared for the 
visit. We will use the approved REDcap system to obtain consent. [CONTACT_101230] or other approved study 
personnel will go over the entire consent document on the phone with the parent to ensure comprehension 
and to confirm identity. Parent will be given a copy of the completed, signed consent form in person or 
by [CONTACT_71345]. 
 
10.0 Study Design / Methods  
Jenkins, Coker-Bolt   Version 3  3/3/22 
 
 
12 
 Overall Study Design : This study will determine the feasibility, and safety of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-directed taVNS 
paired with CIMT therapy in n=10, 6-18month old infants with hemiplegia after perinatally acquired 
brain injury. We will measure the effect of active taVNS paired with [ADDRESS_111737] is delivering taVNS to 
determine feasibility.   
The alternative treatment  is the usual and customary occupational therapy services. If parents wish, 
they may pursue CIMT therapy with local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], but there are very few qualified therapi[INVESTIGATOR_101186].  
We will monitor for and mitigate following risks are present with this study:  Risk of skin irritation, 
risk of discomfort, risk of slightly decreased heart rate, and risk of loss of confidentiality.  
Risk of skin irritation: we will monitor the skin on the inner aspect of the left ear before and after each 
session, and will switch to the right ear if redness is present, and decrease the stimulation if redness 
persists. 
Risk of discomfort: We will protect against the risk of discomfort by [CONTACT_101219]. We will use the 
mother’s perception of infant discomfort and infant signs of discomfort to determine the perceptual 
threshold, and then treat at 0.1mA less than this level of perception. If any infant seems to be in 
discomfort during the CIMT taVNS session, we will decrease the microcurrent by 0.1mA, as in our 
feeding taVNS trial in infants. We will use facial expression change, fidgety movements and infant 
vocalization as signs of behavioral discomfort, to indicate need for decreasing the microcurrent during 
the taVNS session. 
We will not continuously monitor heart rate during the taVNS session, as our extensive HR data in 
infants show no bradycardia and no decrease in HR beyond 60 seconds after starting stimulation. 
Risk of loss of confidentiality: We will check the infant’s medical records to gather the following 
information: gestational age at birth, ventilator support, head ultrasound and MRI results, bottle feeding, 
infection, neonatal condition during labor and delivery, infant’s treatments and conditions, and 
developmental progress.  
We will assign study numbers to each participant, keep CRF and consent forms in locked offices.

 12.0 Data Management  
Analysis and Statistical plan : We will compare the change in score on functional measures between 
CIMT+ taVNS via repeated measures ANOVA from pre- to immediately and [ADDRESS_111740] grasp mean changed from 
4.50±2.6 to 5.25±3.1 with 3h/day CIMT (∆=0.75), versus 4.14±2.6 to 5.73±3.0 with 6h/day CIMT 
(∆=1.59). We estimate 40h of CIMT+taVNS, 2h/day CIMT+taVNS will be similar to 3h CIMT, ∆grasp

of the taVNS system. [CONTACT_101230] will be immediately available to the RA to monitor safety and adverse 
events. 
 
An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be formed to advise the study investigators. The 
SMC will review and evaluate accumulated study data to ensure safety, as in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. They also 
will make recommendations concerning continuation, modification, or termination of any of the taVNS 
studies. It will be composed of [CONTACT_101232] PT PhD and NM4R PI, [CONTACT_101233], OT 
PhD; and [CONTACT_101234], MUSC associate professor psychiatry and assistant provost with extensive 
VNS, TMS, and tDCS experience. The SMC and IRB will be notified immediately of any and all SAE's. 
  
Drs. Jenkins, McGloon and Coker-Bolt will obtain informed consent for mother and infant to participate, 
during which participants’ guardians are fully advised on the research procedures to be used, the amount 
of time required of them, the possible risks and benefits of the procedures, their right to refuse their 
infant’s participation in the study without prejudice, their right to terminate participation of their infant 
at any moment without prejudice, and the name [CONTACT_101227]. We

form in person or by [CONTACT_71345]. 
 
Regarding confidentiality, subjects’ guardians are informed that the information they provide, as well as 
participation in the study, will be kept strictly confidential, with access limited to the research staff. We 
will check the infant’s medical records to gather the following information: gestational age at birth, 
ventilator support, head ultrasound and MRI results, bottle feeding, infection, neonatal condition during 
labor and delivery, infant’s treatments and conditions, and developmental progress.  
The identity of subjects in databases will be protected with alphanumeric codes. All data will be kept in

age prior to [ADDRESS_111742] to do so in writing, and withdraw any future use of the child’s 
videotape. Videotapes will not be released to other parties not directly involved in our research. 
 
 
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Parents may withdraw their infants at any time. Reasons may include excessive demands of time 
for CIMT or family pressures. Infants may be withdrawn without parental consent, if taVNS is 
poorly tolerated. If either occur, parents will be referred for clinical CIMT, of if this is not 
possible within the parent’s home structure, other occupational and physical therapy as 
appropriate. We will continue to collect follow-up data on motor skills even with early 
termination, if infants continue with USC OT department. 
15.0 Risks to Subjects 
 
Risks of taVNS  
taVNS is transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve that innervates 
the ear. Although this novel therapeutic modality is still in the development and optimization process, few 
risks are expected by [CONTACT_101224]. TENS devices are FDA approved for 
pain relief and are available over the counter. The main risks associated with TENS are electrical hazards 
that may result in user discomfort or injury. The unit used in these studies (Soterix) is a custom modified, 
FDA-cleared electrical stimulator that meets the standards of the FDA for investigational use. Skin 
irritation, redness, or inflammation may occur under the stimulating electrodes, but these have not been 
observed with short term use. 
 
Two studies have used TENS on neonates to try to prevent or mitigate painful procedures (39- 40). The 
TENS was administered at acupuncture sites with increasing current from 1-3.5 mA, and Hz from 2-10 in 
30 healthy infants <3 days old. (39) In a subsequent study, this investigative team randomized 162 term 
neonates to TENS (3.5mA, 10Hz) or usual care to prevent pain from lancet heelsticks for blood sampling 
(40). These TENS parameters were safe and did not cause discomfort in the neonates. TENs has also been 
used with passive stretching in neonatal torticollis at 8Hz, 0.2mA for 30 minutes continuously (41) and in 
brachial plexus nerve injuries starting at 6 weeks of age to improve motor function of the hand, in 
Jenkins, Coker-Bolt   Version 3  3/3/22 
 
 
15 
 conjunction with constraint induced movement therapy (42). Neither study reported adverse effects of 
electrical stimulation. TENS has also been used in peroneal and sacral nerve stimulation for dysfunctional 
voiding and stooling (44- 45). Finally, the routine sweat test employed in newborns and infants to confirm 
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis uses transcutaneous electrical stimulation to deliver pi[INVESTIGATOR_101189] (43). From the product brochure of the Nanoduct™ Neonatal Sweat Analysis System 
(Discovery Diagnostics, Canada), the nominal current is 0.5 (± 0.02) mA to 5 mA for 2.5 minutes (± 0.2 
sec).  
 
taVNS also has associated risks that may arise from the direct brain effects stimulating the vagus nerve. 
The transient decrease in heart rate is a well described risks associated with neuromodulation of the 
parasympathetic nervous system that we have also observed in infants in the administration of noninvasive 
taVNS. The decrease in heart rate of 20±10bpm from a baseline HR of 160bpm occurs within [ADDRESS_111743] been multiple studies in which taVNS has been used on humans, none of them reporting 
significant adverse events. A simple PubMed search for “transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve 
stimulation” shows more than [ADDRESS_111744] been observed and any side effects were resolved by [CONTACT_101225]. 
There also is currently a commercial tVNS device available for purchase on the European market 
(Cerbomed - Nemos device; www.cerbomed.com) that is marketed as a take- home treatment for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. 
Not only does the current literature show a lack of harm done by [CONTACT_101226], the side effects of implanted 
VNS of alteration of voice, coughing, pharyngitis, hoarseness, headache, and nausea, have not been 
reported with taVNS. Cardiac evaluations have been made on hundreds of VNS, and more recently 
taVNS patients, with no changes in cardiac function (Handforth et al, 1998; Sackeim et al, 2001b; 
Morris and Mueller, 1999) with long-term safety confirmed in recent large sample retrospective 
studies (Menascu et al, 2013; Ryvlin et al, 2014; Choi et al, 2013). 
We performed taVNS paired with feeding in 35 infants in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_101190]. A summary of potential risks in infants include the risk of skin irritation, 
discomfort, transiently decreased heart rate, and loss of confidentiality. Bradycardia: Our own safety 
studies designate a transient measurable change in heart rate (-20 to  10bpm), lasting <60 seconds, 
which is not clinically significant in infants with baseline HR of 140- 160bpm in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
(Badran BW, 2020, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience). 
Given the minimal risk of taVNS FDA approved/cleared devices, we anticipate that taVNS paired with 
CIMT will be a very safe procedure in infants. The potential risks will be clearly outlined in the 
informed consent document, as in our prior infant taVNS study. MUSC’s IRB has previously 
determined our taVNS system to be minimal risk device.  Nevertheless, there may be unknown risks 
with experimental procedures. 
 
Risk of loss of confidentiality : We will assign study numbers to each participant, keep CRF and consent 
forms in locked offices. Database files with names and contact [CONTACT_101221]. All other data files related to this study will be identified by 
[CONTACT_61212], without link to standard identifiers. We will publish the aggregate data only.  
This study will involve research on vulnerable subjects : mothers and their infants with perinatal brain 
injury, potentially as a result of maternal conditions during pregnancy.  
 
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects or Others 
Jenkins, Coker-Bolt   Version 3  3/3/22 
 
 
16 
 The infants with perinatally acquired brain injury constitute a vulnerable populations, but the procedures 
in this protocol are all minimal risk procedures (CIMT, motor assessments). Other than the novelty of 
using taVNS in infants, taVNS also involves little risk: equivalent TENS units are widely available on 
the internet for home purchase and use in all ages. 
The intervention of pairing taVNS and CIMT could offer considerable benefit to both families and infants. 
taVNS paired with CIMT training may enhance infant motor skills in infants who have one-sided 
weakness, and enable the infants to achieve greater upper extremity function with less time commitment 
than the maximum CIMT protocols that are [ADDRESS_111745] Coker-Bolt’s or 
McGloon’s  office when not in use, and in a locked cabinet when in daily use for a participant.  
Only authorized investigators will have access to this locked cabinet. 
The Soterix units is a custom device based on an taVNS device that is FDA cleared for 
investigational use. (see Soterix letter)

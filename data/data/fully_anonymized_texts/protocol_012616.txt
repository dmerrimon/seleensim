The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of repeat injection of jCell  
Secondary Objectives:  
To assess the impact of repeat injection of jCell on measures of visual function and functional vision over a 12 month 
period, including BCVA, mobility (maze), CS, and VF Methodology: This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, Phase 2 study of human retinal progenitor cells (jCell) for the treatment of 
retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP).  Eligible subjects include those previously treated with jCell.  
A group of [ADDRESS_847960] the choice of eyes for treatment . 
Subjects will be monitored closely following injection for 60 minutes prior to being released home on the day of 
treatment, based on intraocular pressure <30mm Hg and vital signs returned to pre -injection.  Following treatment, all 
subjects will be treated wit h ophthalmic corticosteroid eye drops to minimize any inflammation from injection for a minimum of 7 days (including tapering schedule), or longer as if determined by [CONTACT_1704].  Blood samples for antibody testing (PRA and DRA) will be collect ed at baseline and at months 1 and 6. Subjects will be followed at 
specified intervals for 12 months for evidence of safety and efficacy.  
Subjects may be asked to  undergo additional , optional testing  at baseline and specified timepoints to explore retinal 
sensitivity and the characteristics  of the injected jCell s during follow -up. Number of patients:   25-30 (depending upon availability)  previously treated jCell subjects will be retreated in one previ ously treated eye to 
assess safety of reinjection. If a subject has been previously treated with jCell in both eyes, the better seeing eye will be 
selected for re -treatment unless there are specific circumstances that make this not advisable, as judged by [CONTACT_31821].  This is considered to be an adequate number of subjects to be able to judge whether the safety profile is 
consistent with  that which has been seen previously with an initial treatment (JC -01 and JC -02) or a fellow eye treatment 
(JC-01E).  This number assumes that there will be at least 25 previously treated subjects who desire a repeat treatment in a 
previously treated eye.   Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Inclusion Criteria

Reference:                    (For national Authority Use Only) Duration of treatment:  Treatment with jCell consists of a single intravitreal injection . The injection procedure itself takes approximately 2 
minutes. Patients will be released to home on the day of injection.   All study subjects will be followed for one year from 
injection.   Criteria for Evaluation: Safety: Safety will be assessed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_20721], physical examinations and vital signs, clinical laboratory 
values, and anti -drug antibodies (DRA, PRA). In addition, specific ophthalmalogic tests to monitor safety will be 
performed, including slit lamp and fundus examiniation, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Clinical safety data will be 
reviewed on an ongoing basis.    
Efficacy:  
Efficacy will be assessed based on a series of ophthmalogic assessments performed  at specified intervals , including best 
corrected visual acuity, mobility (maze), contrast sensitivity, and visual field testing.  
 Statistical methods: Background and demograhic data will be summarized for all subjects using descriptive statistics.  
Efficacy : Secondary efficacy endpoints include mean change at six and 12 months in the following assessments: best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA), to be measured with the electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (E -ETDRS); mobility 
score (maz e navigation scored by [CONTACT_634911], CIL); visual fields assessed by [CONTACT_634912], and 
contrast sensitivity.    
Descriptive statistics will be used to tabulate and summarize study outcomes. The baseline results of clinical ex aminations 
of the injected eye serve as controls for the injected eye. Results of testing of the non -treated eye will also be described.  
Continuous variables will be summarized descriptively (sample size, mean standard deviation and error, minimum and 
maximum). Discrete variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_247411], and analyzed with non -parametric 
statistics.    
Safety : The primary endpoint of this study is to obtain safety profiles for reinjection of jCell. The safety analyses of AEs 
and laboratory parameters will include descriptive statistics.  Summaries of AEs will be generated by [CONTACT_24975] (AE or SAE), 
body system and p referred term, severity, and relationship to study product.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
 Retinitis Pi [INVESTIGATOR_247383] (RP) refers to a group of inherited diseases causing retinal degeneration. 
The cell -rich retina lines the back inside wall of the eye. It is responsible for capturing 
images from the environment . People with RP experience a gradual dec line in their vision 
because photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) die. Forms of RP and related diseases include 
Usher syndrome, Leber’s congenital amaurosis, rod -cone degeneration , Bardet -Biedl 
syndrome, and Refsum disease, among others.  
In most forms of R P, rods are affected first. Because rods are concentrated in the outer 
portions of the retina and are triggered by [CONTACT_247412], their degeneration affects peripheral and 
night vision. When the more centrally located cones - responsible for color and sharp ce ntral 
vision - become involved, the loss is in color perception and central vision.  Night blindness is 
one of the earliest and most frequent symptoms of RP.  
RP is typi[INVESTIGATOR_247384].  The classic clinical sign of the 
disea se is the presence of dark deposits in the retina.  The main risk factor is a family history 
of retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802]. It is an uncommon condition affecting about 1 in 4,000 people or 
roughly 100,000 individuals in the US1. Cases of RP are associated with a wide variety of 
known gene mutations , with new mutations still being discovered. The mutations can be  
inherited from one or both parents  or occur spontaneously ; the pattern of inheritance can be 
autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X -linked  or mitoch ondrial. 
There is no effective treatment for RP; once photoreceptors are lost, they do not regenerate. 
The rate of deterioration of vision varies from person to person, with most people with RP 
legally blind by [CONTACT_654] 40.  People with RP also often develop ca taracts at an early age or 
swelling of the retina (retinal edema).  Numerous breakthroughs in the treatment of cataract 
and corneal disease have greatly decreased the incidence of blindness from these causes. In 
contrast, treatment of retinal and optic ner ve disease is more limited, with these conditions 
now representing major causes of incurable visual loss and a significant unmet medical need.  
 Stem /Progenitor Cell s 
No restorative treatments for retinal cell loss currently exist, but stem cell treatment  has 
emerged as a particularly promising strategy. In addition, the concept of delaying retinal cell 
death through the use of neuroprotective agents has considerable merit and committed 
progenitor cells are useful platforms for delivery of neuroprotective cy tokines. Also, the 
possibility of reinvigorating non -functional yet viable cones is an underappreciated yet 
attractive potential clinical target.

 Cells and tissues of many types survive injection  to the subretinal space, in part because this 
location exhibits characteristics often referred to as those of an “immune privileged ” site2. 
Both photoreceptors3 and RPE cells4,[ADDRESS_847969] circuitry and failure of donor RPE cells to 
adhere to Bruch’s membrane have thus far frustrated attempts to achieve functional repair  
using these methods . For photoreceptors, there is a fundamental problem that must be 
overcome , namely the physical barrier to neurite outgrowth posed by [CONTACT_247413] (OLM). In photoreceptor degeneration, the OLM undergoes hypertrophy and 
regenerating neurites are impeded by [CONTACT_247414]6.  Glial hypertrophy has been often been 
implicated in the failure of endogenous regenerative  mechanisms to bridge a lesion7, e.g., 
after spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]8. 
 CNS and Retinal Progenitor Cells  
It has been demonstrated that transplanted CNS progenitor cells are not impeded by [CONTACT_247415]9,10. The ability to migrate into the mature 
retina is characteristic of CNS progenitor cells, which do not simply migrate, but exhibit 
widespread integration into the local cytoarchitecture, with pronounced tropi[INVESTIGATOR_634903] o f 
disease.  
Hippocampal progenitors transplanted to the vitreous of neonatal rats integrated into the 
retina and developed morphologies appropria te to their layer of residence11.  In the 
dystrophic Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat, it has been shown that  grafted hippocampal 
progenitors developed rod photoreceptor -like morphologies and extended neurites into the 
optic nerve9; however, brain -derived progenitors did not express retina -specific markers. This 
lineage restriction has been overcome using progeni tor cells derived from the retina . Retinal 
progenitor cells can be derived from the developi[INVESTIGATOR_247386], mice, pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], cats and 
humans . 
The first simultaneous sourcing of retinal - and brain -derived neural progenitors from the 
same premature infa nt occurred in 1999 and both progenitor cell types were found to express 
MHC I antige ns, but not MHC II12.  Cultured hRPCs  expressed a range of markers consistent 
with CNS progenitor cells.  hRPCs could be distinguished from human brain progenitor cells 
by [CONTACT_247416] , particularly recoverin. More recently, age 18 
weeks gestation was found to  be a suitable age developmental stage for isolation of hRPCs.  
Although rejection is the norm for grafts between individuals of disparate genetic 
background, this tendency is markedly less problematic when placed in an “immune 
privileged ” site such as the  eye. This does not mean that allogeneic grafts to these sites 
cannot be rejected, but that they benefit from a decreased likelihood of rejection. It has also 
been shown that CNS progenitor cells themselves exhibit properties of cell -specific immune 
privil ege. Rat hippocampal progenitor cells were not recognized by [CONTACT_634913]13 and murine brain progenitor cells survived transplantation to the allogeneic kidney 
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   11 of 37 
 capsule, a non -privileged site14. The mechanisms underlying cell -specific im mune privilege 
may relate in part to the major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens.  
Studies have indicated that MHC class I expression is consistent for progenitors from 
different individuals or strains within a given species. This is the case for multiple e xamples 
of CNS progenitors from the brain and retina of mouse and human. Another trend, of 
considerable importance to clinical transplantation studies, is an absence of detectible MHC 
class II expression for all CNS progenitor cells examined from mouse, ra t, and human. The 
classical mechanism of graft rejection involves the nonspecific recognition of foreign MHC 
class II molecules by [CONTACT_398]4+ host lymphocytes. Hence, an absence of class II molecules 
would allow grafted progenitor cells to evade immune rejection  mediated by [CONTACT_247418]. CNS progenitor cells therefore differ from solid tissue grafts of either brain or 
retina, both of which contain class II -expressing cells.  
1.2 jCell  (human Retinal Progenitor Cells, hRPC)  
The investigational product (jCe ll) to be tested  is a live suspension of  human retinal 
progenitor cells (hRPC) suspended in clinical grade medium.  The hRPC are of allogeneic 
human fetal origin.  Following manufacture, the hRPC intended for therapeutic use are 
cryopreserved using 90% com plete growth medium and 10% DMSO in a controlled -rate 
freezer.  The characteristics and functional properties of the investigational product are 
summarized in the following table (Table 1).  Most functional assays are performed after the 
cryopreserved cell s are thawed and cultured for approximately [ADDRESS_847970] Results

A range of non -clinical studies has been performed to assess the functionality and 
distribution of injected hRPC.  Collectively the nonclinical data demonstrated that allogeneic 
grafts show prolonged survival in the vitreous, retina, and subretinal space in all mammalian 
species tested, despi[INVESTIGATOR_247387], with evidence of graft -
associated benefits at the behavioral level, specifically with respect to neuroprotection of host 
photoreceptors.  Prolonged survival is possible except in cases of xenotransplantation to non -
immunosuppressed animals, and differentiation with expression of relevant m arkers together 
with functional rescue has been demonstrated in animal models.  The scope, duration, and 
exposure achieved in these studies are considered to be fully supportive of the planned 
human clinical trials.

trial of jCell of 28 subjects  included  four D ata Monitoring Committee  reviews of safety data  
over the course of the study , with no important safety concerns noted at any time point.   
One SAE was reported in the Phase 1/2a study . The event, which was reported as Grade [ADDRESS_847974]

 (human retinal progenitor cells). The subject's relevant medical history was remarkable for 
nonspecific musculoskeletal abnormalities, myocardial bridge, hypercholesterolemia, 
clavicle fracture, ruptured disc, hypertension, colon polyps, esophageal reflux, fracture 
reduc tion, coronary artery disease, vitiligo, diabetes (Type II), vitamin D deficien cy, actinic 
keratosis, obstructi ve sleep apnea and anemia.  The study investigator reported the event as 
possibly related to study treatment initially but after further testing indicated that the event 
was unlikely to be related .  
Subjects who completed the phase 1/2a study were allowed to enroll in an extension study 
with an option to be followed longer term for safety and, if desired, to receive an injection of 
jCell in the fel low eye (eye that was not treated in the main study).  Twenty four of 28 
subjects from JC -01 study enrolled in the extension study, including 22 subjects who 
received a second injection (1 x 106 jCell).  All subjects have been followed for at least a 
year beyond the second injection, with the safety profile continuing to be very acceptable.  
One SAE was reported in the extension study.  “Atrial fibrillation or worsening of atrial 
fibrillation” has been reported as a Grade [ADDRESS_847975] instance in the extension study required a cardioversion procedure and the 
second an ablation procedure.  The events were not cons idered to be related to study 
treatment.  
Based on the demonstration of acceptable safety and tolerability in the phase 1/2a study at 
doses up to 3 x 106 hRPC, a phase 2b study was performed  to compare the changes in visual 
function and functional vision in  subjects who receive a single jCell injection in comparison 
to a comparable mock -treated  control group of subjects with RP , with a requirement for 
BCVA between 20/80 and 20/800 in the study eye, to provide a sufficient “margin” for 
assessment of improveme nt after treatment.   The study include d jCell doses of  3.0 x 106 and 
6 x 106 based on the results of BCVA testing in the phase 1/2a study, which were  suggestive 
of a dose response relationship, with best results at the highest dose  (3 x 106 jCell) . Subjects 
enrolled in the phase 2b study (JC -02) were randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_847976] relevant endpoint in the  poor vision

of a battery of visual assessment tools in the phase 1/2a study subjects by [CONTACT_634918],

as Grade 3 medically significant ocular hypertension of the right eye, six days fo llowing 
study treatment  with 3 x 106 hRPC.  Treatment for this event included medications and two 
“taps” to relieve intraocular pressure during the week following study treatment. At a follow 
up visit, the IOP was reported to have returned to normal levels.  Although the study 
investigator was apparently unaware of it at the time of subject enrollment, the medical 
records (received subsequent to the event) indicate the subject ha d a history of glaucoma, an 
exclusion criteri on for the study.  It is considered possible that this may have increased the 
subject’s risk for IOP following the intravitreal injection procedure.   
The second event, which was reported as Grade [ADDRESS_847978] that had been assigned to the control 
group initially and elected to “cross -over” to a test group after completing [ADDRESS_847979] dose (6 x 106 hRPC) , and especially in a subset of subjects 
who are defined by [CONTACT_634919], with visual fields of at least [ADDRESS_847980] equally functional to the non -study eye at study start (e.g. , 
not significantly worse) .  In addition, preliminary data are also suggestive that the thickness 
of the remaining EZ layer as assessed by [CONTACT_634920] a predictor of th e subjects 
most likely to benefit from jCell treatment.  The rationale for the proposed study is to answer 
a key safety question about  jCell reinjection into a previously treated eye.  
While retreatment of a patient in the fellow eye  at least [ADDRESS_847981] 12 months (primary endpoint in the phase 2b study) and perhaps 
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-[ADDRESS_847982] will eventually diminish.  Thus , it 
becomes important to establish the safety of retreatment.  
In addi tion to safety, all subjects will be followed for efficacy for 12 months using the 
following  methods : best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), mobility (maze), contrast 
sensitivity, and visual field testing.  
Subjects may be asked to undergo additional testing to assess  the characteristics  of the jCell 
aggregate inside the eye  (size and structure) and retinal sensitivity following treatment . 
Participation in these ad ditional assessments at the jCyte low vision facility is optional and is 
not required for study participation.  
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objectives:  
The primary objective of the study  is to assess the safety of repeat injection o f jCell  at a dose 
of 6 x 106 hRPC . 
2.2 Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives o f the study are  to assess the impact of repeat injection of jCell on 
measures of visual function and functional vision over a 12 month period.   
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, multi -center , single a rm, Phase 2 study of human retinal progenitor 
cells (jCell) for the treatment of retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP).  The study will include only 
subject s previously treated with jCell.  
To assess reinjection of a previously treated eye, subjects who have previously  been treated 
with jCell and desire a second treatment in the same eye  will be enrolled .  Subjects must have 
completed at least [ADDRESS_847983] one eye retreated; the eye to 
be retreated will preferably be the better seeing eye, but exceptions may be made  by [CONTACT_96908], taking into consideration BCVA, prior response to treatment, and any 
other medical conditions that may indic ate which eye is the best candidate for retreatment. 
Subjects will be followed for 12 months for safety and efficacy.  
As noted above, subjects may be asked to undergo additional testing at the jCyte low vision 
facility to assess the characteristics of the jCell aggregate inside the eye (size and structure)  
and retinal sensitivity  following treatment.   These are exploratory assessments,  and any/all 
may be discontinued if they are determine d to be difficult to conduct or the results appear to 
be of little value in understanding the course of the injected cells  and/or changes in retinal 
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-[ADDRESS_847984] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  as assessed at the 
clinical site at all visits , as well as mobility  (maze navigation) , contrast sensitivity ( CS), and 
visual fields ( VF) at baseline and at six and 12 months after treatment  as assessed at the jCyte 
low vision facility . 
 Safety Endpoints  
The main criteria that will be used to assess  safety include:  
• Incidence and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE)  
• Safety visual assessments: slit lamp and fundus exam, IOP  
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at baseline and at desig nated times post -
treatment  to assess immunogenicity of the injected cells (PRA, DRA) .

withdrawal assessments, which will be recorded in the CRF.   
The investigator will provide or arrange for ap propriate follow -up (if required) for subjects 
withdrawing from the study and will document the course of the subject’s condition.  
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
5.1 Dose and Schedule  
At the time informed consent is obtained, qualified subjects will be assigned a study number . 
All subjects will receive a single intravitreal injection of 6.0 x 106 hRPC into one previously 
treated eye.  After topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459] , a single 65 microliter suspension of cells will be 
delivered into the vitreous cavity using a 30 g needle. This treatm ent does not require 
surgical detachment or manipulation of the retina. The injection procedure itself takes 
approximately 2 minutes.  Following 60 minutes of observation with no serious clinical 
symptoms or manifestations (IOP < 30 mm Hg and vital signs c omparable to pre -treatment), 
subjects will be released to home on the day of injection. Please refer to the study procedure 
manual for details of patient preparation and monitoring.

 Ophthalmic AEs  
Procedures will be performed at scheduled intervals to specifically assess eye AEs that may 
not be detected by [CONTACT_634923] . Please refer 
to the study procedure manual for details of all ophthalmolog ic assessment procedures.  
Slit lamp and fundus exam  - The binocular slit -lamp examination provides a stereoscopic 
magnified view of the  eye structures in detail, enabling anatomical diagnoses to be made for 
a variety of eye conditions. This assessment will include detection of anterior chamber cell or 
flare; acute cataract development or progression in phakic patients, or vitreous haze.  Fundus 
exam allows for inspection of the retina, the cellular graft, and detection of retinal 
detachment.   
Optos photography  - Optos  photography includes a widefield dilated Optos photograph of 
the posterior segment with any cell cluster fro m the anterior v itreous visualized in the photo 
frame  along with the posterior segment/fundus .  
IOP - Intraocular pressure is measured with a  tonometer  as part of a comprehensive  eye 
examination .  Measured values of intraocular pressure are influenced by  [CONTACT_634924], Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   28 of 37 
 7.2 Efficacy Assessments  
 Please strictly adhere to the study procedure manual for details of all ophthalmolog ic 
assessment procedures.  
 Spectral Domain Optical Cohere nce Tomography (OCT) (performed locally and 
read centrally)  
A clinical OCT machine will be used for data collection; the same machine should be used 
for any given patient at each time point.  OCT results will be sent to a central reading lab for  
assessment .  
 Mobility Testing  (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
In general, the mobility test will consist of differing but structurally similar configurations of 
a relatively short maze (e.g. arrows on a printed floor mat) with ten obstacles, of various 
sizes. Subject testing consists of walking through several configurations each at a different 
illumination level as a test of mesopic visual function. Each test is videotaped and scored for 
speed and accuracy (number of errors) by [CONTACT_634925] a score, 
the critical illumination level  (CIL) , is derived from the illumination level at which a 
significant drop in functional performance is observed (slow walking speed and increase in 
errors).  For subjects assessed during the  baseline testin g who have an estimated monocular 
CIL of 1 lux or lower  (near normal vision) , they will be tested with that eye on both a high 
contrast (black and white) and  a low contrast version ( either 25% or 10% light grey arrows)  
at baseline and each low vision visit . A larger range of testing improvement should occur in 
the low contrast version , allowing for greater test sensitivity (i.e., preventing a ceiling effect) 
if the subject’s vision improves with treatment.  
 BCVA  (E-ETDRS)  (performed at the clinical site)  
BCVA will be tested at scheduled time points in both eyes in all subjects . Visual acuity will 
be measured with the electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (E -ETDRS)  for eyes with 
vision better than 20/800. The measurements will be taken  using a single l ine testing strategy 
with two measurements  per eye at each study visit . In the event that the two measurements  
differ by [CONTACT_634926], then a third measurement will be taken .  For an y individual 
eye that cannot be tested with the electronic visu al acuity testing algorithm (E -ETDRS), a 
score of [ADDRESS_848004]’s distance v ision.  Performed properly, the 
examiner obtains not only the refractive error, but additional potentially essential 
information, such as the level and quality of visual acuity, sensitivity to blur, effects of glare 
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   29 of 37 
 and the quality of fixation. The optical  theory involved is the same as when refracting the 
normal eye, but special adjustments in lens selection, presentation strategy, and “just 
noticeable difference”, are incorporated for low vision patients.  These adjustments usually 
include large lens incr ements and special techniques for exploring and refining cylinders.   
 Visual Field Testing  (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
Subjects enrolled in the study may have a severely restricted visual field (e.g., 4 degrees in 
diameter) with or without ecc entric islands in the mid to far -periphery in advanced RP, or 
they may have full visual fields but reduced photopic sensitivity in earlier stages of RP.  The 
Octopus 900 will be used for  kinetic visual field testing  using a specified target of V4e for 
more  severe subjects and a target of III4e and V4e for better seeing subjects. Target size will 
be selected based on baseline visit for each eye separately . Whatever target size (s) is/are 
selected, the same size will be used throughout the study on that partic ular eye.    
 Contrast Sensitivity  (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
A contrast sensitivity test measures the ability of a subject to distinguish between finer and 
finer increments of light versus dark (contrast).   Contrast provides critical information about 
edges, borders, and variations in luminance. Contrast sensitivity is correlated to performance 
on many real world tasks and  tests that generate a curve or multiple sensitivity thresholds at 
varying grating sizes  (spatial frequency ) provide an in -depth view of functional vision.  
Using the Beethoven System, m ultiple thresholds and varying spatial frequencies creating a 
curve  will be measured monocularly and the peak of the curve compared over time. Each 
spatial fr equency is tested up to four times (thresholds) so the mean threshold at the p eak 
contrast sensitivity for each eye will be compared over time.  
7.3 Exploratory Assessments  
 Ultrasound Biomicroscopy ( UBM ) (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
With  an same ultrasound instrument as  for A and B -scans, but using a different probe  for 
UBM , high frequency  high-resolution images of the cross -sectional anterior chamber can be 
acquired . UBM will be used to explore a  more thoroug h volume estimation by [CONTACT_634927] d 
imaging of the jCell aggregate over time.  
 B-Scan (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
B-scan ultrasound uses hi gh-frequency sound waves to obtain measurements and produce 
detailed images of the eye. In the area of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_634906], two probe directions 
(perpendicular to the corneal surface and inferotemporal) will be used to locate jCells.  
This test may provide information regarding the location of the injected cells and the general 
size of the cell clusters at different time points post-treatment .

CONFIDENTIAL   30 of 37 
 
 A-Scan  (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
A-scan ultrasound  also uses h igh-frequency sound waves to obtain  measurements of the 
length of the eye and the size of the jCell  aggregate . These measurements can be used to 
support calculations that may be needed  in exploratory analysis . With such corrections  from 
A-scans , more precise volume estimation of the jCells may be achieved.  
 Slit lamp biomicroscopy with gonio scopy lens & photography  (performed at 
jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
Binocular slit -lamp biomicroscopy provides a stereoscopic magnified view of  eye structures, 
enabling general anatomical exploration of the jCell aggregate over time . When combined 
with a gonioscopy contact [CONTACT_13293]  (three -mirror  lens with gel between the lens and cornea ), a 
greater viewing angle into the anterior vitreous behind the iris  to view and 
photograph /videograph  jCell s can be achieved . Photography  and/or video re cording  through 
the gonio scopy  lens will be used as a means to explore the shape and size of the jCell 
aggregate over time.  
 Hyperspectral OCT (whole eye)  (performed at jCyte Low Vision Facility)  
Standard SD -OCT imaging  is primarily used for image segmenta tion of the posterior 
segment and often specifically the macular region. However, it may be possible to capture a 
cross -section of jCell using novel variants of OCT imaging in order to  understand cell 
morphology. In order to image anterior vitreous or peri pheral retina l locations where  injected  
jCells may be  located, an OCT instrument for anterior and posterior segment imaging will be 
used.  
 Full Field Scotopic Threshold Test (FST)  (performed at jCyte Low Vision 
Facility)  
Full-field stimulus threshold testing (FST) using LED -based ganzfeld stimulator (Colordome, 
Diagnosys LLC, Littleton, MA) can provide an estima tion of which photoreceptor type (rod 
vs cone) is predominantly mediating light sensitivity. With serial FST asse ssments, changes 
in the retinal sensitivity  of rods vs. cones in response  to jCell therapy will be assessed . Blue 
and red stimuli can be  used for testing monocularly under dark-adapted condition s.  
8.[ADDRESS_848005].  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a study (investigational) product  or treatment (e.g. mock injection) , 
whether or not related to the study product  or treatment . 
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   31 of 37 
 Examples of an AE inc lude:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study ( RP) 
• A new condition  detected or diagnosed after study product administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study product 
or a concurrent medication  
• Pre- or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures  
• Antibody  development  
An AE does not include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., colonoscopy or biopsy); the medical condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Social or convenience hospi[INVESTIGATOR_247399]  
• Day-to-day fluctuations of a pre -existing disease or conditions present or detected at 
the start of the study that do not worsen  
• The disease/disorder being studied ( RP), or expected progression, signs, or symptoms 
of the disease/disorder being studied unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition  
All AEs that occur after informed consent is signed will be recorded in the source documents 
and on the appropriate CRF page. The information to be collected includes the nature, date 
and time of onset, intensity (mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, death), duration, 
causality (relationship to investigational product), and outcome of the event. Even if the 
AE/SAE is assessed by [CONTACT_247438], its 
occurrence must be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate page of the 
CRF.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be defined as AEs that occur after the study treatm ent 
(injection or mock injection) .  
8.2 Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is one which:  
 •    is fatal or life threatening,  
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   32 of 37 
 • is permanently or significantly disabling, or  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_634907]:  
• is not previously reported with the agents or procedures being undertaken, or  
• is symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to a reported toxicity but 
differs because of greater severit y or increased frequency.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical  or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the above definition.  
The Investigator must report all SAEs and all deaths to the study sponsor or designee  
immediately by [CONTACT_247439] (5) days .  A toll free number  and an 
SAE reporting form to report such events will be provided.  See also section [ADDRESS_848006] -screening data. The safety population comprises all subjects who receive any study 
treatment.  For the purposes of this study the safety population will be used for efficacy and 
safety analyses.  
9.2 Efficacy Analyses  (Secondary Endp oints)  
Efficacy endpoints are secondary analyses and include assessment of change in BCVA, 
mobility, contrast sensitivity, and visual fields.  
BCVA will be measured with the electronic visual acuity testing algorithm (E -ETDRS) and 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_634928].  
Mobility will be assessed by [CONTACT_634929] , unilaterally  
and bilaterally.    
Descriptive statistics will be used to tabulate and summarize study outcomes. The baseline 
results of clinical examinations of the injected eye serve as controls for the injected eye  for 
the purpose of reporting changes in visual parameters from baseline to [ADDRESS_848007] -
treatment . Results of testing of the non -tested eye will also be described.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized descriptively (sample size, mean standard deviation and error, 
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   33 of 37 
 minimum and maximum). Discrete variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_247411], 
and analyzed with non -parametric s tatistics.  
Subjects who cannot perform a specific visual test at baseline will be assigned the lower limit 
of detection, if applicable, for the relevant test.  Subjects with missing data (no assessment) at 
baseline will be considered non -evaluable for ana lysis of that assessment.    
9.[ADDRESS_848008]. The safety analyses of 
AEs and laboratory parameters will include descr iptive statistics  by [CONTACT_1570] .  
Summaries of AEs will be generated , type (AE or SAE), body system and preferred term, 
severity, and relationship to study product.    
9.4 Other Analyses  
Demographics :  Background and demographic data will be summarized for all subjects.   
Exploratory : Data from exploratory imaging and retinal sensitivity assessments will be 
summarized . 
10.0 ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Adverse Experiences  
All adverse experiences (AE) must be recorded and reported to the sponsor.  Any serious and 
unexpected AE will be reported to the sponsor or designee  immediately by [CONTACT_247440] (5) days .  The Investigator must also notify the 
institutional IRB/EC. A full report, including clear photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_247401], 
consultants' reports, autopsy findings where appropriate, and a summary of the outcome by 
[CONTACT_737], including his opi[INVESTIGATOR_247402], will be furnished 
to the study Sponsor or designee  as soon as practicable.  It is the sponsor’s responsibility to 
notify the FDA, other regulatory  agencies as appropriate, and all clinical sites in compliance 
with regulatory requirements.  
10.[ADDRESS_848009] be reviewed and approved by a properl y constituted Institutional Review 
Committee operating under the Code of Fede ral Regulations (21CFR Part 56) .  A signed and 
dated statement that they have approved the protocol must be submitted to the sponsor prior 
to the start of the study.  This committ ee must also approve all amendments to the protocol.  
10.[ADDRESS_848010].  
10.4 Monitoring Procedure  
At the time the study is initiated, the principal monitor and/or co -monitors will thoroughly 
review the protocol and case report forms with the Investigators and their staff.  During the 
course of the study, the princ ipal monitor, the co -monitor or their designated deputies shall 
be available to discuss by [CONTACT_30100], questions regarding adverse reactions, 
removal of subjects from trial, conduct of the study, etc.  
At the time of each monitoring visit, the  monitor will review the case report forms of each 
subject in the trial to make certain that data is reported in a timely fashion, that all items have 
been completed and that the data provided are accurate and obtained in the manner specified 
in the protoc ol.  The subject ’s clinical records will be reviewed to confirm that the case 
report form data are consistent with the physician's clinical records.  The monitor will verify 
the adherence to the procedures and schedule as defined in the protocol.  The subj ect's 
clinical records will be reviewed to determine whether recording of adverse reactions or side 
effects has been omitted on the case report forms.  If this is found to be so, then the case 
report forms will be returned to the Investigator and corrected  to include this information.  
At the time of the monitoring visit, it is the responsibility of the participating site to provide 
completed up -to-date case report forms, and to provide ready access to source documents.  
10.5 Reporting and Recording of Data  
In the US, federal regulations require that copi[INVESTIGATOR_634908] a period of no less than two (2) years following either the approval of 
Biological License Application or the withdrawal of the Investigational New Drug 
Application.  The Sponsor  will advise the Investigator when the two -year period begins.  
Attention of the Investigator is drawn to the fact that he/she may be subject to a field audit by 
[CONTACT_634930], as well as in compliance with Good Clinical Practices.  
All information required by [CONTACT_247442], or an explanation given for 
omissions.  A monitor will verify the validity and compl eteness of the forms at each 
monitoring visit.  
jCyte, Inc  Clinical Study Protocol Protocol No. JC02-2   
CONFIDENTIAL   35 of 37 
 All data and information on the case report forms are to be neatly recorded in type or legibly 
printed in black ink for ease of duplication, interpretation and analysis before submission  to 
the Sponsor designe e.  All corrections on the case report forms should be crossed out neatly 
and the new entry initialed  and dated by [CONTACT_186164]'s staff making the 
correction.  Prior to forwarding the final case report forms, they should be reviewed for 
completeness, accuracy and legibility by [CONTACT_737].

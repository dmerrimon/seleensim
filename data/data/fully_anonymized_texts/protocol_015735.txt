Amendment 2 01 December 2020
Amendment 1 03 April 2020
Original Protocol 17 December 20 19
Amendment 2(01 December 2020)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union .
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
The changes are to remove one atogepant treatment arm and change the study  design to a 2-arm 
study , reduce the sample size, a dd measures to protect participants or stud y personnel in 
pandemic situations (eg, COVID-19, such as, replacing office visits by  [CONTACT_859158], 
etc)and to enable participants to roll over into long -term extension study  3101 -
312-002. In
addition, the amendment is to simplify inclusion and exclusion criteria, clarify  study  objectives 
and endpoints, study  assessments, statistical analyses, and resolve d iscrepancies in the protocol.
Section No. and Nam e Description of Change Brief Rationale
Throughout Removed the atogepant 30 mg QD 
treatment arm from the study and 
reduced the total number of 
participants from 627 to 
300participants (initial protocol 
had 209 participants in each of 
3treatment arms, the amended 
protocol has 150 partic ipants in 
each of 2 treatment arms). The results from the Phase 3Study 3101-
301-[ADDRESS_1197246] 
efficacy while not having a clinically 
meaningful difference in safety. Ther
efore, 
the sponsor decided to elimi nate the 
atogepant 30 mg QD treatment arm in this 
study and re -estimate the sample size , 
which reduced the number of participants 
required to demonstrate a significant 
difference in atogepant 60 mg QD 
compared to placebo based on observe d 
responses in Study 3101 -301-002.

previous secondary objective and 
endpoints of evaluating the effect 
of atogepant versus placebo on 
functioning and activity 
impairm ent by [CONTACT_859159] -D dom ains of Performance 
of Daily Activities and Physical 
Impairment.To further clarify the previous s econdary 
objective and endpoint related to

Exploratory: Deletion of CFB in 
monthly headache- free days at 
Weeks 1 -4, 5-8, and 9 -12.To remove redundancy because monthly 
headache -free days will be complementary 
to monthly headache day.
Exploratory: Deletion of CFB in 
monthly headache day pain 
intensity at Weeks 1 -4, 5-8, and 
9-12.To remove redundancy because headache 
pain intensity can be interpreted using 
monthly moderate/severe days.
Exploratory: Deleted Week 16
from HIT -6and MSQ v2.1
assessment s asanendpoint for 
evaluation of efficacy .Treatment with atogepant or placebo end s
atWeek 12 (Visit 7) and it is predicted that 
many participants will enroll in the safety 
extension Study 3101 -312-002. S o an 
assessment at Week 16 will not assess the 
participant’s ability to function while on 
treatment and the number of part icipants 
who will actually have a Week 16 (Visit 8) 
will be low .

into Study 3101 -312-002 (long -term 
extension study).  
4.2 Justification for Dose Updated this section with results 
from Study 3101 -301-002 that 
verifies that the atogepant 60 mg 
QD dose has a higher efficacy than 
the atogepant 30 mg QD dose 
without adding any safety risk.Verifies the results from Study CGP -MD-
01 and justifies the deletion of the 
atogepant 30 mg QD treatment arm from 
this study.

282. Introduction
Atogepant is a potent, selective oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist 
(CGRP -RA) being developed for the prophy laxis of migraine.
2.1. Study Rationale
This study  is being performed to prospectivel y assess the safet y, tolerability ,and efficacy  of 
atogepant 60 mg QD compared with placebo in the proph ylaxisof epi[INVESTIGATOR_859138] 2 to 4 classes of oral proph ylactic treatments. This 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study  is primarily  designed to generate 
data for health technology  assessment, andis also
a trial to confirm the efficacy  of these doses in 
thispatient population. The rationale for the overall study  design is in Section 4.1.
2.2. Back ground
Migraine affects 18% of women and 6% of men in the [LOCATION_002] with peak prevalence 
occurring between the ages of [ADDRESS_1197277] ( Lipton 2007 ). In the [LOCATION_002] alone, work loss due to migraine is estimated to cost 
~ $13 billion annually  (Hu1999). Prevalence is similar in Europe, with migraine headache 
affecting on average 17.6% of women and 8% of men ( Stovner andAndree 2010). As of 2016, 
migraine is the second leading cause of disability  worldwide ( Global Burden of Disease [GBD] 
2017).
Migraine is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_160324], unilateral headache of moderate or 
severe pain intensity , associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity  to light (photophobia) 
and sound (phonophobia). I n about 25% of individuals, the migrai ne headache is preceded b y 
focal neurological d ysfunction (aura). Improving diagnosis and optimizing treatments for 
migraine have been recognized as critically  important to overcoming current barriers to reduce 
the global burden of migraine.
Because there are no biological markers for migraine, diagnosis is based on clinical history , 
exam, and the exclusion of other headache disorders. Phy sicians appl y clinical criteria to guide 
diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) can be divided into 
low frequency  
(LFEM) and high frequency  epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (HFEM) depending on the headache day s 
suffered per month (GBD 2017). 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) is a sy ndrome diagnosis applied to patients with migraine (with or 
without aura) who have 1 to 14 headach e day s per month. Chronic migraine is a specific ICHD -3 
diagnosis applied to a subset of patients with ≥15 headache day s per month ( Katsarava 2012; 
Olesen 200
6; ICHD -3 2018 ). 
This study  will include participants with epi[INVESTIGATOR_859139] 2 to 4 classes of prior
oralproph ylactic medications. The rationale for targeting this population is 2 -fold. Firstl y, 
patients on currentl y available oral proph ylactic 
medications may  experience poor tolerabilit y; 
secondly , many  of these treatments have shown insufficient efficacy (did not sufficiently  reduce 
either severity  or frequency ) of migraine for many patients ( Blumenfeld 201 3; Hepp 2017 ).
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
29Discontinuation rates for existing oral prophy lactic medications are high for both epi[INVESTIGATOR_529970] ( Blumenfeld 201 3). The patterns of prophy lactic medication use in persons 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_859140] -sectional, theInternational 
Burden of Migraine Study  
(IBMS -II)with [ADDRESS_1197278] common reasons for 
discontinuations were lack of ef ﬁcacy  and side effects: 
In persons w ith epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730], approximately  37% to 48% reported discontinuation of a 
prophy lactic medication due to lack of efficacy , whereas 35% to 49% reported 
discontinuation due to side effects.
In persons with chronic migraine, 39% to 48% reported discontinu ation due to lack of 
efficacy , and 34% to 53% reported discontinuation due to side effects.
The consequences of the limitations in current oral prophy lactic migraine treatments amount to 
both poor adherence ( Berger 2012 ; Hepp 2017) and reluctance to initiate prophy lactic treatment 
(Silberstein 2015 ). In fact, recent studies have indicated that approximately  half of migraine 
patients discontinued their initial oral migraine prophy lactic treatment within 60 day s, which 
might be explained b y poor tolerability or lack of efficacy (Blumenfeld 20 13; Hepp 2017). 
Moreover, in a US -based retrospective database study  it was concluded that approximately  
70% of patients who begin migraine proph ylaxis with antidepressants, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], or 
beta-
blockers are no longer taking these medications at 6 months (Berger 2012). Of those 
patients who continue to take a proph ylactic medication, many  still have substantial disease 
burden (Silberstein 2015).
Ther efore, the proposed population for Study  [ADDRESS_1197279] failed multiple migraine proph ylactic oralmedications, 
and these patients are currently  often rel ying on ineffective treatme nts and many  suffer from 
intolerability  to currently available medications. 
Atogepant is a potent, selective oral CGRP -RA being developed for migraine prevention. CGR P
isaneuropeptide implicated in
thepathoph ysiology  ofmigraine. CGR Plevels inthecranial
venous outflow (ie, external jugular vein) areincreased durin g amigraine attack and
exogenous lyadministered CGR Phasbeen shown to trigger migraine- likeheadache in 
migraineurs. The majorit y (80% to 90%) oftrigeminal Aδfibers thatinnervate thedura contain
CGRP ,
suggesting that these fibers may be involved insterile neurogenic inflammation and
migraine pain transmission. Furthermore, the CGRP receptor is present on human meningeal and
cerebral blood vessels. These observations suggest that activation of the trigeminovascular

30(photophobia, phonophobia, andnausea), aswell asthekey secondar y endpoint of 24-hour
sustained pain freedom (Connor 2009 ).However, serum ALT increases were observed with 
telcagepant. For this reason, the development of these oral CGRP antagonists was stopped.
Atogepant was chemically  designed to minimize the potential for reactive metabolites, thereby  
[CONTACT_859166], and MK -3027. An 
extensive Phase 1 program, including a 28 -day multiple dose study  of doses up to 170 mg QD, 
has been conducted to assess hepatic effects of atogepant. 
A Phase 2/3 clinical study (Stud y CGP -MD-01) was conducted, which compared atogepant 
10 mg QD, atogepant 30 mg QD, atogepant 30 mg BID, atogepant 60 mg QD and atogepant 
60 mg BID to placebo in prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730]. Overall, all the atogepant doses tested 
were well tolerated and the AE profile of all atogepant doses did not significantly  differ from 
placebo. For the primary  efficacy  endpoint of change from baseline in mean monthly  migraine 
days across the 12- week treatment period, all atogepant doses demonstrated a statistically  
significant reduction compared to placebo in participants with epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].
A recently  completed Phase 3 clinical study  (Study  3101 -301- 002) evaluated the efficacy , safety , 
and tolerability of atogepant [ADDRESS_1197280] of care has comple ted (Study  3101-302- 002) in the prevention of epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730]. 
Similar to the [ADDRESS_1197281] month and was sustained over the 1 -year treatment period. The LS mean change 
from baseline in the monthly  migraine day s was -3.84 day s at Weeks 1 -4 and -5.19 day s at 
Weeks 49-52.
To date, no safety  signal in hepatic lab parameters has been observed in either preclinical or 
clinical studies conducted with atogepant.

312.3. Benefit/Risk  Assessment
The C GP-MD-01 Phase 2/3study  demonstrated that atogepant is efficacious for the proph ylaxis
of migraine. All doses of atogepant demonstrated significant clinical benefit in reducing the 
number of mean monthl y migraine days and other endpoints. Atogepant was safe and well 
tolerated in the stud y. With its mode of action as a CGRP- RA, at ogepant is differentiated from 
the currently  available oral prophy lactic treatments (ie, beta -blockers, anticonvulsants, etc) by  [CONTACT_859167] y profile. With its oral route of administration, it also offers a clear 
benefit if compared to recently  approved injectable CGRP -RA monoclonal antibodies. 
This study  will compare the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of atogepant 60 mg QD to placebo 
in the prevention of migraine in participants who previously failed 2 to 4 classes of proph ylactic 
oraltreatments. Th is patient population especiall y requir esnew therapeutic alternatives. 
An independent DSMB will review unblinded safety  data throughout the trial and make
recommendations to the sponsor, including modification or early  termination of the trial, if
emerging data show unexpected and clinically  significant adverse effects of treatment. Although
this is a 12
-week placebo -controlled trial, treatment for acute migraine is allowed during the
study .
Overall, the benefit- risk assessment supports the clinical investigation of atogepant for the 
prophy laxis of migraine. 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y 
expected AEs of atogepant may  be found in the investigator’s brochure.

364. Study Design
4.1. Overall Design
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group stud y 
conducted at approximately 125sites globall y (North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific ). 
Approximately  300 participants will be randomized to one of 2treatment arms (placebo, and 
atogepant 60mgQD) in a 1:1 ratio as follows:
Placebo (n = 
150)
Atogepant 60 mg QD (n = 150)
Randomiz ation will be stratified based on region ( North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific) ,
number of migraine day s during the screen ing/baseline period (4 to < 8 and ≥ 8) and number of 
classes of failed prior prophy lactic treatments (2 and > 2)
. 
Block randomization will be applied with a block size of 4 (2 treatment arms × 2). 
A randomization cap of 20% will be instituted to ensure that the planned randomized participants 
include no more than 20% of participants with 4 to < 8 migraine day s at baseline.
Approximately  50% of randomized participants will have failed > 2 classes of prior prophy lactic 
treatments.
Participation will begin with a 4-week screening/baseline period. Participants who complete the 
4-week screening/b aseline period and meet all entry  criteria will be randomized to the double -
blind treatment period of the study  at Visit 2 (Random ization Visit). The double -blind treatment 
period will last 12 weeks, with a subsequent safety  
follow -up p eriod of 4 additional weeks. Total 
duration of study  participation for one participant isapproximately 20 weeks.
There will be 8 scheduled clinic visits: Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline Visit ), Visit 2 
(Randomization Visit ), Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8), 
Visit 7/ET (Week 12), and Visit 8 ( Week 16/EOS/ Safety  Follow -up). The Visit 8/EOS / s afety  
follow -up period must be completed for all participants who take at least one dose of stud y 
intervention , except for participants rolling over into Study  3101 -312- 002 (long -term safety  
extension study ). For these rollover participants Visit [ADDRESS_1197297] be completed .(Please refer to the SoA, Section 1.3).
This study  is conducted at US (I ND) sites and non- US (non- IND) sites. Data from IND and 
non-IND stud y sites will be pooled together for anal ysis.
4.2. Justification for Dose
This study  will test one dose
of atogepant, 60 mg QD, selected based on the results from the 
Phase 2/3 study  CGP -MD-01 and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] 3101-301-002 inparticipants with epi[INVESTIGATOR_41989]. All atogepant doses investigated in Study  CGP -MD-
01 and Study  3101 -301-002 
demonstrated good safety  and tolerability .

To be eligible for randomization in this study , participants must have failed 2 to 4 classes of prior 
oraltreatments for the prophy laxis of migraine, as described in Section 5.1Inclusion C riteria.    
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
44Participant failure of a prophy lactic medication can be on the basis of tolerability  or efficacy  and 
is based on inv estigator judgement.
For efficacy, investigators must c onsider:
Failure is defined as no meaningful reduction in frequency  of migraine day s after an adequate 
trial of at least [ADDRESS_1197305] 7 years prior to screening .
For tolerability , investigators should consider:
Failure is defined as discontinuation of a drug treatment due to adverse effects at an y 
previous time. 
In assessing failure of a migraine preventive drug on the basis of inadequate tolerability ,the 
entire medical history  can be considered. For example, a participant who tried and 
discontinued topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] [ADDRESS_1197306] 
failed this treatment. 
5.4. Lifestyle Considerations
5.4.1.
Meals and Dietary Restrictions
Participants should refrain from consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice from the time the 
consent form is signed until completion of the study . Participants should also refrain from 
making significant changes to their diet during the study .
5.4.2. Caffeine, Al cohol, and Tobacco
Participants should also refrain from making significant changes to their caffeine intake during 
the study .
Alcohol intake should be limited to no more than 1 drink per d ay throughout the study . A drink 
is defined as a 12 -ounce (approxim ately  350 mL ) can/bottle of beer, a 4 -ounce (approximately  
120 mL )glass of wine, or 1 ounce (approximately 30 mL )of liquor.
Use of recreational drugs, including cannabis, regardless of legality  is prohibited throughout the 
study .
5.4.3. Activity
No restrictions
.
5.5. Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the study  but are not 
subsequently  randomized to treatment. Rescreening of screen failures is permitted in certain 
situations (including failure to adequatel y screen due to the COVID -19 pandemic) ,with 
permission from Allergan. A participant who is rescreened will be screened again in the I WRS 
and given a new participant number. However, participants with clinically  significant la boratory

A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants to meet the CONSORT publishing requirements and to re spond to queries 
from regulatory  authorities. Minimal information includes indicating screen failure as reason for 
ending the stud y, demography , screen failure details, eligibility  criteria, and any  SAE .
5.5.1. Procedure for Duplicate Participant Identification 
–Verified Clinical
At participating sites in the [LOCATION_002], acentral vendor will be used to verify  participants’ 
current and past research study  status in order to mitigate safet y concerns associated with 
duplicate enrollment and protocol deviations associated with multiple trial enrollment. Following 
proper inform ed consent and after issuing a participant number, each participant will be checked 
in the VCT database, indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3). Par tial identifiers will 
be utilized. Participants who are identified as verification failures b y VCT should not be enrolled 
without documented approval from Allergan.

6.1.1. Study Interventions and Formulations
Tablets containing atogepant [ADDRESS_1197308] 
will also include the medication number. 
Participants who meet all of the study  entry  criteria at Visit 2 will be randomized and provided 
with study  intervention to be taken on an outpatient basis.
Sites will subsequently  dispense stud y 
intervention to participants at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6. Immediately  before dispensing the study  
intervention, the investigator (or appropriatel y trained designee) will write the participant’s 
identification number and the date on the label.
Participants will take their first dose study  intervention at the clinic at Visit 2 after laboratory  
sample collection and will be instructed to take their study  intervention at approximately  the 
same time each day . Study  intervention may  be taken with or without food. Water is allowed as 
desired. Study  intervention will be administered orally  for 12 weeks, and participants will be 
followed for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the study  intervention.

6.1.4. Intervention Allocation Ratio
Approximately  300 participants will be randomized to the following 2treatment arms in a 1:1 
ratio:
Placebo (n = 
150)
Atogepant 60 mg QD (n = 150)
Randomization will be stratified based on region (North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific) , 
number of migraine day s during the screening/baseline period (4 to < 8 and ≥
8) and number of 
classes of failed prior prophy lactic treatments (2 and > 2)
.
A randomization cap of 20% will be instituted to ensure that the planned randomized participants 
include no more than 20% of participants with 4 to< 8migraine day s at baseline.
Approximately  50% of randomized participants will have failed > 2 classes of prior prophy lactic 
treatments.
6.1.5. Other Study Supplies
The following will be provided by  [CONTACT_613135] a delegate of Allergan’s:
All supplies needed for blood and urine sampling (central laboratory anal ysis, urine, and 
urine dipstick reagent strips).
All supplies needed for on -site urine pregnancy  test.
All supplies needed for PK sample collections.
Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_160337] .
All supplies needed for ECG assessment including ECG machine.
Electronic diaries.
Electronic tablet(s)
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
1.The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study  intervention received and an y discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the stud y intervention.   
     
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
482.Only  participants enrolled in the study  may  receive study  intervention ,and only  
authorized site staf f may
 supply  or administer study  intervention .All study  intervention 
must be stored in a secure ,environmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or 
automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to 
the investigator and authorized site staff.
3.The investigator , institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for stud y intervention accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie,receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records) .
4.Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study  interventions 
are provided in the Study Reference Manual .
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Atogepant tablets and matching placebo will be provided in identical blister cards to maintain 
masking of the stud y. All participants will be instructed to take stud y intervention once a day  
(1tablet) at approximately the same time each day. Participants will there fore, receive either 
placebo, or atogepant 60 mg once a day .
Prior to initiation of study intervention , each p articipant who provides informed consent will be 
assigned a participant number that will serve as the pa rticipant identification number on all study  
documents.
At the R andomization Visit (Visit 2), eligible participants will be randoml y assigned to 
1
of 2treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio to receive atogepant 60mgQD, or placebo. 
An automated I WRS will be used to manage the randomization and intervent ionassignment 
based on a randomization scheme prepared b y Allergan Biostatistics.
Study  intervention will be labeled with stud y intervention kit numbers. The I WRS sy stem will 
provide the site with the specific medication kit number(s) for each randomized participant at the 
time of randomization. Sites will dispense study  intervention according to the I WRS instructions. 
Sites will also log onto the I
WRS at subsequent visits to obtain a kit number for dispensing study  
intervention. Sites will receive the IWR S confirmation notifications for each transaction. All 
notifications are to be maintained with the study  source documents.
The I WRS will be programmed with blind- breaking instructions. In case of an emergency , the 
investigator has the sole responsibility  for determining if unblinding of a participant’s study  
intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safet y must always be the first consideration in 
making such a determination. I f the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the 
investigator should make every  effort to contact [CONTACT_859174] a participant’s study intervention assignment unless this could delay  emergency  
treatment of the participant. I f a participant’s study  intervention assignment is unblinde d, 
Allergan Medical Monitor must be notified within [ADDRESS_1197309] be recorded in the source documentation.

If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may  request destruction of any  samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study  records.
See the SoA (Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of study  discontinuation and 
follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed.
7.3. Lost to Fol low-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y the study  site.
The following actions must be taken ifa participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:
The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_78778] m issed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishe s to and/or should continue in the 
study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every  effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls ,and if 
necessary ,a certified letter to the participant ’ s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_842331] ’s 
source data .

558. Study Assessments and Procedures
Study  procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or 
exemptions are not a llowed.
Immediate safety  concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately  upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study  
intervention.
Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and required for stud y conduct. All assessments will be conducted at the appropriate visits as 
outlined in Section 1.3, the SoA, a nd the timing of the visits should occur as close as possible 
to the day  specified. At each visit, the participant will be asked if the participant changed the 
dose/regimen of an y existing concomitant medications or initiated the use of an y new 
concomitant medications since the last visit to ensure compliance with the protocol.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility  criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
recor d details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. Rescreening of participants may  be considered with 
permission from Allergan (Section 5.5). Also, all women of childbearing potential must have 
negative results on the urine pregnancy  test at the Screening and Randomization Visits 
(Visits [ADDRESS_1197314] administration o f study  intervention).
Prior to randomization, it must be confirmed that the participant had 4 to 14 migraine day s 
and < 15 headache day s during the 28 -day baseline period (see Section 8.1.1 for definition) 
and completed the eDiary for at least 20 of the 28 day s.
There will be 8 scheduled clinic visits: Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline), Visit 2 (Randomization), 
Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 (Week 6), Visit 6 (Week 8), Visit 7/ET 
(Week 12), and Visit 8 (Follow -up). 
Additional examinations and laboratory  assessments may  be performed as necessary  to 
ensure the safet y and well -being of the participants during the stud y perio d. Unscheduled 
visit eCRFs should be completed for each unscheduled visit.

should be performed after the participant has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_1197316]. The overall interpretation of the clinical significance of the ECG 
will be determined by [CONTACT_544960] ’s eCRF. 
8.2.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Section 10.2 (Appendix 2)for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and the 
SoA for the timing and frequency . Hematology , chemistry , coagulation parameters (INR), and 
urinaly sis will be conducted at each visit. Serology  and the urine drug screen will be conducted 
at Screening (Visit 1). Investigators may  also perform unscheduled clinical laboratory  
determinations at an y time for the purpose of participant safety.Participants are not required to 
fast overnight before coming in for their appointments .
At screening, the investigator or subinvestigator will assess the clinical significance of an y 
values outside the reference ranges provided b y the laboratory , and participants with 
abnormalities judged to be clinically  significant will be excluded from the study .
The investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and record any  
clinically  relevant changes occurring during the study  in the AE 
section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory  reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically  significant abnormal 
laboratory  findings are those that are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged 
by [CONTACT_19448]’ s condition.
Positive results with the urine drug screen at Visit 1, unless explained by  [CONTACT_859178] ,will be excluded from the study .Urine drug screens positive for 
recreational (including cannabis regardless of legality ) or illicit drugs or non -disclosed 
concomitant medications are not allowed to be repeated. All other positive urine drug screens 
may only be repeated with permission from the Sponsor.
A positive pregnancy  test at Visit [ADDRESS_1197317] dose of study  intervention should be repeated until the values 
return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by  [CONTACT_093].
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a perio d of time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_1275], the etiology  should be identified and the sponsor notified.
All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defined in Section 10.2 (Appendix 2), must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory  manual and the SoA .
8.2.5.
Suicidal Risk Monitoring
Atogepant is considered to be CNS active and par ticipants being treated should be monitored 
appropriatel y and observed closel y for suicidal ideation and behavior. The C-SSRS is a clinician 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
59rated instrument that reports the severit y of both suicidal ideation and behavior. Suicidal ideation 
is classified on a 5-item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), 3 
(active suicidal ideation with any  methods [no plan] without intent to act), 4 (active suicidal 
ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suic idal ideation with 
specific plan and intent). The C- SSRS also captures information about the intensity  of ideation, 
specificall y the frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe 
types of ideation. Suicidal behavior is c lassified on a 5-item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior), 1 
(preparatory  acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual 
attempt). More than [ADDRESS_1197318] recent attempts. 
The C -SSRS will be completed at all Study  Visits. At screening, the C -SSRS will be completed 
for the participant’s history  of suicidal i deation and behavior in lifetime and in the past 6 months . 
At all other administrations, it will be completed for suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior since 
the previous visit. The C -SSRS will be administered on the eTablet by  a clinician who has been 
certified to administer the C- SSRS. A participant should not be released from the study  center 
until the results of C-SSRS are reviewed and it is confirmed that the participant is not considered 
to be at risk.
Refer to Section 10.3 (Appendix 3)for more information.
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AEor SAE can be found in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3).
AEswill be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant ’s legall y authorized representative).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AEor SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study  interventio n or study  procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the study  (see Section 7).
8.3.1.
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
All AEs and SAEs from the signing of the ICF must be collected until [ADDRESS_1197319] dose 
of study , regardless of whether or not the participant has been administered study  intervention, 
until the Follow -up Visit (Visit 8) (Section 1.3)and as observed or reported spontaneously  by 
[CONTACT_171579] .
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study  intervention ,but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded 
in the AE section of the eCRF and will be considered 
pretreatment AEs .
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3) . The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor
within 24 hours of it being available.
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
60Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEor SAE information after conclusion of the 
study  participation . However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE , including a death, at an y 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonabl y related to the s tudy intervention or study  participation, the investigator must promptly  
notify  the sponsor.
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AEsand SAE sand the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3
(Appendix 3).
8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or 
SAEs . Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences
.
8.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/conta cts. All SAEs [and AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 8.3.9)]
will be followed until resolution, stabiliz ation
, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant 
is lost to follow -up (as defined in Sectio n 7.3).
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_859179]/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as full y as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinati ons, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the 
investigator will provide the sponsor or designee with a cop y of an y postmortem findings 
including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed eCRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data tosponsor or designee within 24 hours of 
receipt of the infor mation.
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for 
SAEs
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_19990] y of participants and the safet y of 
a study  interventio nunder clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and 
other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study  intervention under clinical 
investigation. The 
sponsor will comply  with country -specific regulatory  requirements 
relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory  authority , IRBs/IECs, and investigators.
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
61An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing anSAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs ) from the sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the investigator ’s brochure and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for S[LOCATION_003]Rs according to local regulatory  
requirements and sponsor policy  and forwarded to investigators as necessary .
8.3.5. Adverse Reactions, Serious Adverse Reactions, and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions –Expedited reporti ng within the EU
For the purposes of expedited reporting within the EU, the Sponsor will follow the applicable 
definitions for ARs, SARs, and S[LOCATION_003]Rs (for example, as outlined in Article 2 [n,o,p] of 
Directive 2001/20/EC ).Also, seriousness criteria for AEs /ARs (as would apply  to SARs and
S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are currentl y included in the protocol, listed in Section 10.3, Appendix 3.
Adverse Reaction: all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal 
product related to an y dose administered.
Serious Adverse Reaction: an adverse reaction that results in death, is life -threatening, requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574], results in pers istent or significant 
disability  or incapacity , or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (see Section 10.3, Appendix 3)
for further details pertaining to seriousness criteria).
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction: a serious adverse reaction, the nature or 
severit y of which is not consiste nt with the applicable product information (eg, the investigator’s 
brochure).
8.3.6. Pregnancy
Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female p
artners of male participants 
will be collected after the start of study  intervention and until the Follow -Up Visit (V isit 8) 
or 30days after the last dose of study  intervention if the Follow -Up V isit is not done .
If a pregnancy  is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor or designee within 
24hours of learning of the pregnancy  and should follow the procedures outlined in
Section 10.7 (Appendix 7).
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes ( eg,spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomali es, ectopic pregnancy ) or genetic abnormalities (whether leading to an 
elective abortion or not) are considered SAEs.
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
628.3.7. Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs
or SAEs
Signs and s ymptoms associated with acute migraine attack, eg,aura s ymptoms, headache pain, 
nausea and vomiting, sensitivity  to light or sound, are considered to be manifestations of 
migraine and will be captured in the eDiary  as symptoms of the disease but they  will not be 
reported as AE s, unless they  change in severit y or frequency, when they  are to be considered as 
AE. If those events meet SAE criteria, they need to be reported as AEs and SAEs as appropriate.
If the investigator considers these manifestations to have a reasonable possibility  of relati onship 
to the study  intervention(s), then they  should be reported as AEs or SAEs, respectivel y.
Please also see Section 10.3 (Appendix 3) .
8.3.8. Protocol -specific AEs
Not applicable.
8.3.9. AE s of Special Interest
AEs of special interest thatwarrant ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by  [CONTACT_859180] y guidelines to be followed for this 
protocol are outlined in Section 10.3 (Appendix 3) . 
8.3.10. Medication Errors
Medication error refers to any  unintended error in the dosing and/or administration of the study  
interventi onas per instructions in the protocol. Medication errors generall y fall into 4 categories 
as follows:
Wrong study  drug
Wrong dose (including dosing regimen, strength, form, concentration, amount)
Wrong route of administration, including wrong site of administration (eg, wrong ey e)
Wrong participant (ie, not administered to the intended participant)
Medication errors include occurrences of overdose and underdose of the study  intervention .
Overdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity  of the stud y intervention given per 
administration or per day that is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
reference safet y information or protocol for the study intervention or comparator as applicable. 
This also takes into account cumulative effects due t o overdose.
An overdose is an yunintentional administration of atogepant above 60 mg per day  as per the 
protocol .
Underdose: Unintentional administration of a quantity  of the study  intervention given per 
administration or per day that is under the minimum recommended dose according to the 
reference safet y information or protocol.
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
638.4. Treatment of Overdose
For this study , any  dose of atogepant greater than 60 mg within a 24- hour time period will be 
considered an overdose.
At present, specific information regarding treatment of overdose of atogepant is not available. In 
case of an overdose, it may be considered 
that the stomach be emptied and oral gavage with 
activated charcoal be used to help reduce absorption of a togepant.
In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should:
1.Contact [CONTACT_621762] y.
2.Closely  monitor the participant for an y AE/SAE and laboratory  abnormalities until atogepant
can no longer be detected sy stemicall y (at least 2 day s).
3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis within 2days from the date of the last dose of study  
intervention if requested by  [CONTACT_859181] y physician (determined on a case -by-case 
basis).
4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the 
eCRF.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by  [CONTACT_621763] y physician based on the clinical e valuation of the participant.
8.5. Pharmacok inetics
8.5.1. Blood P KSampling Procedure
A blood sample for PK analy sis will be collected on site at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7/ET from 
participants who consent to participate in the PK substudy . Participants can withdraw consent to 
participate in the PK substudy  at an y time and should have no further PK samples collected. 
Each participant in the PK substudy  will be asked to provide a total of 6 blood samples (1 per 
visit) .At Visit 2, the sample should be collected prior to the initial dose of study  intervention 
taken at the clinic. During oneof the Visits 3 to 6, the sample should be collected prior to the 
daily dose of study  intervention (participant should wait to take the dose in the clinic after PK 
sample collection) , and the samples collected at the remaining visits should be collected [ADDRESS_1197320] the daily
dose.
The date and time of collection of each PK sample will be recorded in th e eCRF. I n addition, for 
each of the PK samples collected (except the Visit 2 sample) the date and time of taking study  
intervention prior to the PK sample should be recorded. PK samples will be collected, stored 
(frozen), and shipped according to instruct ions provided in the laboratory  manual.
The treatment codes will be provided to the bioanaly tical lab using a secure process, ensuring no 
one outside the bioanal ytical team is unblinded, to allow only  atogepant
-treated participant PK 
samples to be anal yzed. The bioanal ytical method for the deter mination of individual plasma 
concentrations of atogepant and the performance of the assay during validation and sample 
analysis will be summarized in a separate bioanaly tical report, including the results obtained 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
64from anal ysis of the PK samples. The bioa nalytical report will be appended to the integrated 
clinical trial report. 
Drug concentration information that may unblind the study  will not be reported to investigative 
sites or blinded personnel until the study  has been unblinded.
Bioanal ytical represe ntatives will be unblinded for PK sample bioanal ysis during the conduct of 
the study . The unblinding of bioanal ytical representatives is to be carried out in a secure manner 
following the sponsor’s standard operating procedures. Extreme care and diligence will be taken 
to ensure no other individuals outside the bioanaly tical team will be unblinded .
8.5.2. PK Sample Bioanalysis
Plasma concentrations of atogepant will be determined using validated liquid chromatograph y-
tandem mass spectrometry metho ds.

8.9. Health Outcome Measures and Health Resource Utilization
8.9.1. Activity Impairment in Migraine -Diary (AIM -D)
The AIM -D is an [ADDRESS_1197321] of migraine and is 
comprised of two domains that evaluate performance of dail y activities (7 items) and ph ysical
impairment (4 items). Participants a re asked to rate the level of difficulty  experienced in the past 
24 hours with performance of dail y activities (ie, difficulty with household chores, errands, 
leisure activities at home, leisure or social activities outside the home, strenuous phy sical 
activities, concentrating, and thinking clearl y) and phy sical impairment (ie, difficulty  walking, 
moving bod y, bending forward, 
moving head) using a 6 point rating scale ranging from “Not 
difficult at all,” “A little difficult,” “Somewhat difficult,” “Very  difficult,” “Extremely  difficult,” 
and “I could not do it at all.” Three items include a response of “I did not…,” for example, “I did 
not have errands planned.” The AIM -D was developed as an electronic daily  diary  with the same 
set of questions administered in headache and non-headache versions. The Headache version is 
administered on day s when a participant reports a headache and the Non -Headache version is 
administered on day s when a participant does not report having a headache. The AIM- D instructs 
partic ipants to answer each question based on the level of difficult y experienced in the past 
24hours for both versions, with “during your headache” indicated for the AIM -D Headache 
version. In addition to the two domain scores, a total score using all 11 items can also be 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
65calculated. Each raw daily domain score, as well as the raw dail y total score, are transformed to a
0-[ADDRESS_1197322] of migraine (ie, higher disease burden).
The AIM -D will be collected dail y via the eD iary.
8.9.2. Activity Level and Activity Limitation
Two items based on a [ADDRESS_1197323] 24 hours with a 5- level 
response ranging from “No activity  –Spent all day  lying down” to “Exercised –Brisk walk, 
running, jogging, biking or other activity  for 30 or more minutes. ”The second item will be used 
to evaluate activity  limitation with a 5- level response ranging from “Not at all limited –I could 
do every thing” to “Extremely  limited.”
Activity  Level and Activity  Limitation will be collected dail y via theeDiary . 
8.9.3. Patient Satisfaction with Study Medication (PSSM)
Overall satisfaction with the study  medication for prevention of migraine will be assessed using a 
single item and a 7 -point rating scale ranging from extremely  satisfied (0) to extremely  
dissatisfied (6).
The PSSM scale will be administered in the eTable t at the clinic visits as indicated in the SoA
(Section 1.3).
8.9.4.
Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)
The HIT is a [ADDRESS_1197324] on participant s’ 
ability  to function on the job, at school, at home and in social situations. I t assesses the effect that 
headaches have on normal daily  life and the participant s’ ability  to function. Responses are based 
on frequency  using a 5- point s cale ranging from “never” to “alway s.” The HIT -6 total score, 
which ranges from 36 to 78, is the sum of the responses – each of which is assigned a score 
ranging from 6 points (never) to 13 points (alway s).
HIT-6will be administered in the eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities (Section 1.3).
8.9.5.
Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)
The MIDAS is a 7- item questionnaire designed to quan tify headache -related disability  over a 
3-month period. The MIDAS score is the sum of missed work or school days, day s at work or 
school plus day s of household work where productivity  was reduced by  [CONTACT_859182], missed 
household work day s, and missed non -work activity  days due to headaches in the last 3 months.
MIDAS will be administered in the 
eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the SoA
(Section 1.3).

668.9.6. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
The PGI C is a single item used to measure the participant’s impression of overall change in 
migraine since the first dose of study  medication. The measure uses a 7 -point rating scale with 
responses ranging from “very much better” to “very  much worse.”
PGI-Cwill be administered in the eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the SoA
(Section 1.3).
8.9.7. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Migraine V2.0 
(WPAI :MIGRAINE)
The WPAI :MIGRAINE will be used to assess work productivity  specific to migraine. The 
measure uses a one -week recall and cont ains six questions related to work productivity . The 
WPAI  measures both presenteeism and absenteeism. The measure yields four scores expressed 
as impairment percentages ranging from 0 to 100%: Percent work time missed, percent 
impairment while working, per cent overall work impairment, and percent activity  impairment 
due to migraine.
WPAI -MIGRAINE will be administered in the 
eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the SoA
(Section 1.3).
8.9.8.
European Quality of Life – 5 Dimensional (EQ -5D- 5L)
EQ-5D- 5L is a generic instrument for use as a measure of health status. The EQ -5D- 5L consists 
of 2 components –the EQ -5D descriptive sy stem and the EQ VAS. The descriptive sy stem 
comprises of 5 dimensions (mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, 
anxiety /depression). The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by  [CONTACT_859183] 5 dimensions. The scoring range of the EQ -5D 
descriptive s ystem is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_859146] 0 (dead) to 1 (full health). The EQ VAS records the 
respondent’s self -
rated health on a vertical, VAS where the endpoints are labelled “Best 
imaginable health state” and “Worst imaginable health state.” The scoring range of the EQ VAS 
is from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).
EQ-5D- 5L will be captured on eDiary  during 7 day s in the screening/ baseline period and during 
specific time periods for Visit 1 to 7, except at Visit 8 (Week 16) where it will be administered 
on an eTablet. For details please refer to Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3)as indicated in the 
Schedule of Activities (Section 1.3).
8.9.9. Patient Global Impression 
–Severity (PGI -S)
The PGI -S is a single item used to measure the participant’s impression of severit y in relation to 
migraine s ymptoms overall at the time of administration of the measure. The measure uses a 
5-point rating scale with responses ranging from “none” to “very  severe”.
PGI-S will be administered in the 
eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities (Section 1.3).

678.9.10. Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, Version 2.1 (MSQ v2.1)
The MSQ v2.[ADDRESS_1197325] 4 weeks. It is divided into three domains: Role 
Function Restrictive assesses how migraines limit one’s dail y social and work -related activities; 
Role Function Preventive assesses how migraines prevent these activities; and the Emotion al 
Function domain assesses the emotions associated with migraines. Participants respond to items 
using a 6 -point scale ranging from “none of the time” to “all of the time.” Raw dimension scores 
are computed as a sum of item responses and rescaled to a 0 to100 scale, where higher scores 
indicate better quality  of life.
MSQ V2.1 will be administered in the eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the SoA (Section 
1.3).

9 symptoms of depressive disorders over the previous 2 weeks, on a 4 -point scale: 0 (not at all), 
1 (several day s), 2 (more than half the day s), and 3 (nearl y every  day). The total score ranges 
from 0 to 27 (from best to worst). A score of 15 to 19 is considered as moderatel y severe 
depression and 20 to 27 as severe depression.
PHQ -9 will be administered in the eTablet at the clinic visits as indicated in the SoA (Section 
1.3).
8.9.13. Healthcare Resource Utilization
Healthcare resource utilization questions will be completed in the source documents at the sites 
based on the investigator’s interview with the participant at each stud y visit. This data will then 
be transcribed into the eCRF thereafter. Healthcare resource utilization questions will 
include use 
of migraine-specific healthcare resources due to migraine attack ( eg, visits to any  general 
practitioner, specialist, emergency  room, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and an y diagnostic procedures prescribed 
by [CONTACT_37157]).

9.1. Statistical Hypotheses
The primary  null hy pothesis is that atogepant treatment dose (atogepant 60 mg QD) isequall y 
effective to placebo in decreasing from baseline in mean monthly  migraine day s across the 12-
week treatment period. The alternative h ypothesis is that atogepant dose has a greater effect than
placebo.
For efficacy  analy ses, data will be anal yzed according to participants’ randomization 
assignments, regardless of actual treatment received.
For safet y data anal yses, the participants will be analy zed according to actual treatment received 
(rathe r than as randomized).
9.2. Sample Size Determination
A sample size of 150randomized participants per treatment group will provide a 97% and 95%
power to detect the treatment difference of-1.7 or -1.6 between atogepant and placebo for the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint for the U nited States or the EU, respectivel y. This sample size was 
selected to provide sufficient power for each of the secondary  endpoints in Table 9- 1for the

aThe assumptions applied for the EUwere estimated using off-treatment h ypothetical estimand approach based on
Advance Study data.
The power calculations are based on the following assumptions:
1)Table 9-3 provides the results from two atogepant studies (CGP -MD-01and 
3101-301-002 [Advance Study ]) and Liberty Study (Reuter 2018 ) for the primary  
endpoint. The treatment difference for atogepant 60mg QD v ersus placebo is assumed to 
be observed treatment difference in the atogepant Advance stud y, which is a relative 
conservative assumption in term of primary  endpoint. The standard deviation 
assumptions were based on the variance in Liberty  Study  and monthly  variance observed 
in Advance Stud y for the primary endpoint . In particular, the assumed treatment 
difference from placebo in change from baseline in mean monthly  migraine day s across 
the [ADDRESS_1197330] 
deviation assumptions for secondary  endpoints are listed in Table 9-1 for the U nited 
States and in Table 
9-2for the 
EU, which are based on the results from theatogepant 
Advance stud y.

2)A fixed -sequence procedure will be used for multiple comparisons to control the family -
wise Ty pe I error rate at a 0.05 level. The testing sequence is specified in Table 9-1 and
Table 9-2. Once the primary  endpoint for atogepant dose is significant at 0.05 (2
-sided), 
the secondary  endpoints will be tested sequentially. Statistical powers for secondary  
endpoints are conditional on success of prior endpoints (assuming independence among 
the endpoints) in the sequence .
3)
The dropout rate is assumed to be 15% for endpoints other tha n AIM -D related 
endpoints. The dropout rate for AIM -D endpoints is 21%. A higher missing rate for 
AIM-D endpoints was observed in the Advance Study  because the related measure w as
collected onl y in Today’s eDiary instead of both Yesterday and Today’s eDiary ,If the 
participants may  provide less than 14 records of T oday ’s eDiary  within a 28 -day period, 
it would lead to missing data .
The assumptions of sample size calculation such as SD and dropout rate will be monitored while 
the study  is ongoing and sample size will be adjusted. This blinded anal ysis of variability  in the 
pooled treatment groups will be performed using the primary  efficacy  analy sis model for the

[IP_ADDRESS].4. Collection and Derivation of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Assessments
On a dail y basis during the 28-day baseline period and throughout the study , participants are to 
record into an eDiary information on the daily  total duration of headache, headache specific 
characteristics and s ymptoms, the worst pain severity , and use of an y acute headache pain 
medication. Participants will be able to report headache d ata, including absence of headache, for 
the day  of the eDiary  report and for the day  immediately  prior to the day  of the eDiary  report, as 
long as information reported is for a time subsequent to the participant ’s most recent report. This 
is defined as a one -day “missing -recall” window.
Following randomization on Day  1, there are 4 visits at 2 -week intervals, followed by  2 visits at 
4-week intervals; altogether encompassing a 12- week double -blind treatment phase of the study  
and a [ADDRESS_1197332] 2 -week or 
4-week durations between two consecutive visits and the visits might not align with each 28- day 
period recorded in the eDiary  (ie, Weeks 1 to 4, 5 to 8 and 9 to 12, corresponding to Day s 1 to 
28, 29 to 56, and 57 to 84). Therefore, for data analy sis purposes, the number of migraine day s 
during the last 28 day s prior to the randomization date , will serve as the “baseline”, and change 
from baseline will be calculated for consecutive [ADDRESS_1197333] dose of study  intervention .
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
77In order to be randomized, a participant should be in the screening/ baseline p eriod for at least [ADDRESS_1197334] 20 day s (including missing recall) during the 28
-day 
screening/ baseline period. If less than 28 day s of baseline data are reported, the number of 
headache day s and other such counting variables for “baseline” will be prorated to standardize 
the count to a 28 -day equivalent. Subsequent to treatment start, the number of headache day s will 
be counted in successive and non- overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 4 -week (ie, 28 -day) windows. Headaches that 
continue into a subseq uent 4 -week period will be counted (with recorded severit y and duration) 
as occurring in each period.
If any eDiary window for a participant has at least 12 but less than 28 day s of reported data, the 
prorated approach will be used. If a participant report s less than 12 day s of headache data, the 
participant ’s observed counts in that particular 28- day eDiary  window will be set to missing for 
that window. These prorating rules will be applied to all efficacy  anal yses of eDiary  data unless 
otherwise stated.
[IP_ADDRESS]. P rimary Analyses
The primary  efficacy  analy sis is the change from baseline in mean monthly  migraine day s across 
the 12- week treatment period. 
The primary  comparison between treatment groups will be done by  a MMRM of the change 
from baseline. The statistical model will include treatment group, visit, region , number of classes 
of failed prior proph ylactic treatments ,and treatment group by  [CONTACT_859185]. It will also include the baseline value and baseline -by-visit interaction as 
covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -
participant repeated measurements. Note that baseline monthly  migraine is included in the 
primary  model, therefore the stratification of number o f migraine day s during the 
screening/baseline period (4 to < 8 and ≥ 8) will be excluded in the primary model. On the other 
hand, this stratification will be included in the secondary  and exploratory  analy ses if baseline 
values other than monthly  migraine day s are included in the corresponding models. The 
Kenward -Roger approximation ( Kenward and Roger 1997 ) will be used to estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. The anal ysis will be performed based on all postbaseline values 
using onl y the observed cases without imputation of miss ing values. Pairwise contrasts in the 
MMRM model will be used to make the pairwise comparisons of each atogepant dose to 
placebo. Only data collected during the double -blind period will be included in the anal ysis. 
Participants are alway s analy zed based on the treatment group assigned b y randomization.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Sensitivity Analyses in Missing Data Handling
Multiple sensitivity  anal yses for missing data handling will be conducted and are summarized 
below. Details of the sensitivity  analy ses will be provided in the s tatistical anal ysis plan.
ANCOVA Model Based on 3 -month Average of the Monthly Migraine Days
A supportive anal ysis will be performed on the primary  endpoint using an ANCOVA model. The 
response variable for the ANCOVA model is the change from baseline in th e calculated average 
monthly  migraine day s during the 12 -week treatment period for each participant. The ANCOVA 
model includes terms for treatment, region, number of classes of failed prior prophy lactic 
treatments , and baseline score. The treatment differe nce for atogepant doses versus placebo will 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
78be estimated and reported along with the corresponding 95% CI and nominal p -value for 
superiority  testing.
Within -group Imputation Based on Observed Data
Sensitivity  analy sis will be performed based on imputation using participants from the same 
treatment group with observed data under the MAR assumption. Missing data for participants 
who prematurely  discontinued are assumed to copy  the profile of participants in the same 
treatment group with observed data.
Copy-R eference Approach
Copy -reference approach will be performed on the primary  endpoint to assess the robustness of 
the MMRM analy sis to possible violation of the MAR assumption. This sensitivity  anal ysis is 
one ty pe of pattern mixture models (PMM), under whic h data could be missing notatrandom 
(MNAR), with repeated anal yses combined via the reference based multiple imputation 
procedure . Participants who discontinued in the a togepant groups are assumed to have no 
treatment effect after the discontinuation. Participants are assumed to cop y the profile of placebo 
arm and missing values are imputed based on the distribution estimated from the placebo group 
under the MAR using copy  reference approach .
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1197335] regression to assess the robustness of the primary  MMRM analy sis to the possible 
violation of normality  assumption. This method has been described and referred as ADAP [R] in 
Mehrotra 2012. The detai l of the sensitivity  anal yses will be provided in the SAP .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Analyses
The secondary  endpoints for headache day s, acute medication use day s, MSQ v2.1 Role 
Function
-Restrictive domain score, Performance of Daily  Activities domain score of the AIM- D, 
Physical Impairment domain score of the AIM -D, and HIT- 6 total score will be analy zed in the 
same manner as that used to analy ze the primary  endpoint. 
The 50% responder, defined as a participant with at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the 
3-month average of monthly  migraine day s, will be assessed for each individual . A logistic 
regression model will be used to anal yze the proportion of 50% responders across the 12- week 
treatment period. This model assumes a binary distribution for the response and uses a logit link. 
The anal ysis model will include treatment group, region, and number of classes of failed prior 
prophy lactic treatments as categorical fixed effects; baseline value will be included as a 
covariate. The analy sis will be performed based on all postbaseline values using onl y the 
observed cases without imputation of missing values. The treatment difference in terms of odds 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
79ratio between each atogepant dose group and placebo will be estimated and tested from this 
model. 
The overall ty pe I erro r rate for the primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be controlled 
at the 0.05 level using the fixed sequence procedure following the testing order pre- specified in 
Table 9-1 for the [LOCATION_002] and Table 9-2for the EU .Once one efficacy  endpoint is not 
significant, all subsequent endpoints will not be tested.

In general, other e fficacy ana lyses are perfo rmed atthenominal significance level, without 
adjusting for multiplici ty.
Other e fficac yvariables will be ana lyzed as follows:
For selected diary variables with a continuous response range, the baseline score will be included 
as a covariate in an MMRM a nalysisofthe change f rom baseline. These a nalyses will be 
performed similarl yto the primary MMRM, with focus again on the pairwise contrasts of each 
dose group to placebo.
For variables whe re the data are essentially  bina ry, comparisons between treatment 
groups will be done with logistic regression for variables with only  one post -baseline 
assessment or using generalized linear mixed model for variables with multiple post -
baseline assessment s.
Descriptive statistics will be provided by  [CONTACT_859186]. 
Analy sis of some variables will be limited to descriptive summary  statistics. Details will be 
specified in the SAP.
9.4.2. Safety Analyses
The safet y analysis will be performed using the safety  population and will be fully  defined in the 
SAP. The safet y parameters will include AEs, clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECG parameters, 
and C -SSRS. 
For each of the clinical laboratory , vital signs, and ECG parameters, the last nonmissing safet y 
assessment before the first dose of study  intervention will be used as the baseline for all analy ses 
of that safet y parameter.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events
An AE will be considered a TEAE if the AE began or worsened (increased in severity  or became 
serious) on or after the date (and time, if known) of the first dose of stud y intervention. TE

819.4.3. PK Analyses
A graphical evaluation of the PK and PD data of atogepant will be performed for the 
identification of possible trends. The PK will be evaluated using the existing population PK 
model, updated with data from this study. Individual predictions of atogepant exposure 
(including but not limited to steady  state AUC 0 -Tauand C min) will be evaluated graphicall y for 
potential relationships with efficacy  and/or safe ty endpoints. If graphical evaluation identifies 
possible trends, exploratory  PK/PD analy ses will be performed for the evaluation and 
quantification of potential relationships via nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Efficacy  endpoints 
to be evaluated will include migraine day s and responder rates. A stand- alone pharmacometric 
analysis plan will be written, and the analy ses results will be reported separately  from the 
integrated clinical stud y report.
9.4.4. Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup anal yses will be performed to evaluate the consistency  of treatment effects on the 
primary  efficacy  endpoint for individual regions (North America, Europe, and Asia/Pacific as 
well as the following subpopulations defined b y prior oralproph ylactic treatment failure:
Participants who have failed ≥2 prior oral proph ylactic treatments with 2 different class of 
treatments
Participants who have failed ≥3 prior oral proph ylactic treatments with 2 different class of 
treatments
Participants who have failed ≥ 3 prior oral prophylactic treatments with 3 different class of 
treatments 
Participants who have failed ≥3 prior oral proph ylactic treatments, irrespective of class
Participants who have failed ≥ [ADDRESS_1197340]
Participants take assigned treatment b y randomization during the double -blind treatment period. 
In addition, permitted intervention, rescue interventions and prohibited interventions are 
described below:
Participants are allowed to take therapi[INVESTIGATOR_859148]’s welfare 
(Protocol Section 6.5.1 ) or to apply  “best supportive care” including both acute migraine 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
82medications and acute non-pharmacological interventions to keep the participants in the 
study  (Protocol Section 6.5.2 ). 
The protocol prohibits participants from starting any  new migraine preventive treatments 
during the stud y (Protocol Section 6.5.3 ).
9.6.2. Population
The target population is participant s suffering from migraine with aura or migraine without aura
satisfy ing the inclusion and exclusion criteria as specified in Section 5.
The anal ysis population is defined to be all randomized participants who received at least [ADDRESS_1197341] -baseline 4 -week period (Weeks 1 -
4, 5-8, 9- 12) of eDiary  data, regardless of 
whether on stud y intervention or off study  intervention .
9.6.3. Variable
The variable is the same as the primary  efficacy  endpoint defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1, which is
the change from baseline in the participant’s mean monthly  (4-weeks) migraine day s across the 
12-week treatment period as derived from the eDiary  data.
9.6.4. Accounting of Intercurrent Events
Intercurrent events and their handling rules are as follows:
Participants who start a new migraine proph ylaxis treatment during the double -blind or safet y 
follow -up period 
will have their data during the safet y follow- up period after starting the new 
migraine proph ylaxistreatment excluded from the data analysis.
Participants who di scontinue study  intervention due to all reasons other than starting a new 
migraine proph ylaxis treatment will have their data collected after discontinuation of study  
intervention andthose off -treatment will be included in the anal ysis.
Detailed methods a nd procedures will be documented in the SAP prior to study  completion.
9.6.5. Population -level Summary
The population -level summary  for the primary  endpoint is the difference in primary variable
means between each atogepant group and placebo.
Participants are alway s analy zed based on their treatment assignment by  [CONTACT_17628]. To 
obtain the estimate of treatment effect defined in the off -treatment hy pothetical estimand, an 
MMRM similar to the primary  anal ysis specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] will be performed on 
observed data including both on- treatment and off -treatment monthl y migraine days. 
9.6.6. Off-treatment Hypothetical 
Estimand Approach for the Secondary En dpoints
Continuous secondary  endpoints will be handled using the same estimand approach defined
above for the primary  endpoint.

Atogepant (AGN -241689)
9310.3.1. ALT or AST Elevations
A treatment -emergent ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN is considered an AE of special 
interest.
Any participant with this laboratory  result after study  intervention was taken must have repeat 
testing within [ADDRESS_1197345] be drawn:
hematology  panel
chemistry  panels
INR
serum acetaminophen level
urine drugs of abuse screen
and blood alcohol level
. 
An extra blood serology  sample must be collected and sent to the central laboratory  for further 
diagnostic testing at a later date if needed. In addition, the investigator will perform a complete 
history  and examination to evaluate the participant for possible liver disease.
All AEs of special interest must be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1197346] ≥ 3 × ULN is confirmed, close medical follow
-up is required: For these 
participants, the following laborator y tests must be performed:
anti-hepatitis A IgM
hepatitis B surface antigen
anti-hepatitis B core IgM
hepatitis C antibody
hepatitis C quantitative RNA by [CONTACT_859191]
anti-hepatitis E IgM
anti-hepatitis E IgG   
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
94Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody  
Epstein -Barr Virus IgM antibody. 
The participant must be followed clinically
 and further medical evaluation (for other causes of 
acute hepatic injury ) should be done per the judgment of the investigator and in conjunction 
with medical personnel at the sponsor site . In general, the chemistry  panel should be repeated 
1 to 2 times per week to follow the course of ALT/AST elevation.
Study intervention must be discontinued if any of the following criteria are met:
ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and the participant is s ymptomatic with the appearance of fatigue
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia 
(>5%)
ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 × ULN
ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and INR > 1.5
ALT or AST ≥ 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
ALT or AST ≥ 8 × ULN
The participant may  be rechallenged with study  intervention only  after consultation with the 
sponsor’s Medical Monitor. For participants who are not rechallenged with study  intervention, 
they should be discontinued from the stud y and complete an ET Visit (Visit 7/ET assessments) 
and [ADDRESS_1197347] the sponsor’s Medical Monitor to discuss all cases of 
confirmed ALT/AST elevation ≥ 3 × ULN. All ALT/AST elevations must be followed 
until ALT and AST return to < 1.5 × ULN and there is full clinical resolution.
10.3.2. Potential Hy’s Law Cases
Sites must report every  participant who meets the following potential Hy ’s law criteria if this 
occurs within the time the participant signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_1197348] dose of study  
intervention:
ALT or AST 
≥ 3 x UL N AND
Total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_1197349] AND
Alkaline phosphatase < [ADDRESS_1197350] known 
dose of study  intervention (if the final visit does not occur). A laboratory  alert for possible    
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
97c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216472], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294504]/or intervention
that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244] s. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489627], the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_287408] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disa bility/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal 
life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nau sea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent every day life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  lifethreatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160340]. These events should usually  be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive interventio nin 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.

Information
Definitions:
Woman of Childbearing Potential
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanentl y sterile (see below) .   
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
106Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1. Premenarchal
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant ’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3. Postmenopausal female
A postmeno
pausal state is defined as no menses for 24 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may  be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HR T. However , in 
the absence of 12months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insuf ficient. 
Females on HR T and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of 
the nonestrogen hormonal highly  effective contraception methods if they  wish to 
continue their HR T during the study . Otherwise, they  must discontinue HR T to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status 
before study  enrollment .
Contracept ionGuidance :
Male Participants
Nonvasectomize d male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to 
participate if they  agree to ONE of the following during the intervention period and for at least [ADDRESS_1197355] dose of study  intervention :
Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifesty le 
(abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent
Agree to use a male condom with or without spermicide
In addition, nonvasectomized male participants must r efrain from donating sperm
Nonvasectomized male participants with a pregnant or b reastfeeding partner must agree to 
remain abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_859152] .
Female Participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligibl e to participate if they  agree to use 
a highl y effective or acceptable method of contraception consistently and correctl y as 
described in Table10-2.   
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2
Atogepant (AGN -241689)
107Table10-2 Highly Effective and Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependenta
Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly
Com bined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
Oral 
Intravaginal 
Transdermal 
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
Oral 
Injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independenta
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated w ith inhibition of ovulation
IUD
IUS
Etonogestrel implant (ie, Nexplanon®)
Bilateral tubal occlusion (eg, Essure®, bilateral tubal ligation)
Intrauterine copper contraceptive (ie, ParaGard®)
Vasectom ized Partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective 
method of contraception should be used.
Sexual Abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. Periodic abstinence (calendar, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation meth ods) is not an acceptable method of contraception . The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the participant.
Acceptable Methods
cceptable birth control methods that result in a failure of more than 1% per year include:
Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of 
action
Male or female condom with or without spermicide
Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
Nonhormonal intrauterine device
 combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double -barrier methods) are 
also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.
aTypi[INVESTIGATOR_859153]. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.
The investigator and each participant will determine the appropriate method of contraception for 
the participant during the participation in the study.
Pregnancy Testing:
WOCBP  should only  be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative 
highl y sensitive urine pregnancy test at sc reening (V isit 1) and also a negative urine test 
on Day  1 (V isit 2).
Additional pregnancy  testing should be performed at each stud y visit during the stud y 
intervention period and at the EOS visit (V isit 8), [ADDRESS_1197356] dose of study 
intervention and as required locally.   
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol 3101-304- 002, Amendment 2

108Collection of Pregnancy Information:
Male Participants with Partners Who Become Pregnant 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  male participant’ s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study . This 
applies only  to male participants who receive study  intervention.
After obtaining the necessary  signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly , the investigator will record pregnancy  information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner ’s pregnancy . The female 
partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . Information on 
the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to
the sponsor . Generally , the 
follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  date. Any 
termination of the pregnancy  will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Female Participants Who Become Pregnant 
The investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study . Information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
participant ’s pregnancy . The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the 
neonate, and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor . Generally , follow -up will 
not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks bey ond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AEor SAE , any pregnancy complication 
will be reported as an AEor SAE . Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes (eg, spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) or genetic 
abnormalities (wheth er leading to an elective abortion or not) are alway s considered to be 
SAEs and will be reported as such. Any poststud y pregnancy -
related SAE considered 
reasonabl y related to the study  intervention b y the investigator will be reported to the 
sponsor as des cribed in Section 8.3.4 . While the investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former stud y participants, he or she may learn of an SAE thro ugh 
spontaneous reporting. 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study  will 
discontinue study  intervention and will be withdrawn from the stud y.

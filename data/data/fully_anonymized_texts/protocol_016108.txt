This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted in accordance with 
US government research regulations , and applicable international stan dards of Good Clinical Practice , 
and i nstitutional research policies and procedure s. 
1.1 Background  
Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) is a major risk factor for accelerated graft loss in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_426493].  This type of rejection is associated with the presence of donor specific antibody (DSA) 
before a transplant or an anamnestic response usually in the first month after transplantation.  If left 
untreated, the acute inflammation in AMR leads to transplant glomerulopathy (TG) characterized by 
[CONTACT_426506], tubular atrophy, and rapid graft failure. If treated promptly, however, rena l allografts 
can be salvaged.  The standard of care for treatment of AMR has been clearing donor specific antibodies 
by [CONTACT_426507] -CD20, but this process takes 
time and does nothing to minimize inflamma tion resulting from antibody that has already bound.  The 
inflammation in AMR is known to be regulated by [CONTACT_426508], and therefore complement 
inhibitors have been explored as a potential means by [CONTACT_426509] -mediated injury at 
the level of the target tissue. Studies from independent groups demonstrate that complement inhibition 
can be effective at salvaging kidneys after severe acute AMR.  Chronic AMR from either preformed DSA 
de novo antibody occurring after the first [ADDRESS_538825] a significantly reduced graft half -life.  This is a significant unmet need.  We 
hypothesized that C4d positive AMR recalcitrant to SOC treatment might benefit from the addition of a 
complement inhibitor as add -on therapy.  
 
1.2 Investigational Agent  
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
 
Mechanism of Action  
C1 esterase inhibitor is a normal constituent of human plasma and belongs to the group  of serine 
protease inhibitors (serpi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]) that includes ant ithrombin III, alpha1 -protease inhibitor, alpha2 -antiplasmin, 
and heparin cofactor II. As wi th the other inhibitors in this group, C1 esterase inhibitor has an important 
inhibiting po tential on several of the major cascade systems of the human body, includ ing the 
comple ment system, the intrinsic coagulation (contact) system, the fibrinolytic syste m, and the 
coagulation cascade. Regulation of these systems is achieved  through the  formation of complexes 
between the proteinase and the inhibitor, resulting in i nactivation of both and consumption of  
the C1 esterase inhibitor. C1 esterase inhibitor, which is usually activated d uring the inflammatory 
process, inactivates its substrate by [CONTACT_426510]. C1 esterase inhibitor  
is the only kno wn inhibitor for the subcomponen t of the complement component 1 (C1r), C1s, coagulation 
factor XIIa, and kallikrein. Additio nally, C1 esterase inhibitor is the main inhibitor for coagulation factor XIa 
of the intrinsic coagulation cascade[1]. 
 
Pharmacodyna mics and Pharmacokinetics in Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)  
Onset of symptom relief: Median: 15 minutes per attack  (for HAE).  
 
Duration of action: Time to complete resolu tion of HAE symptoms: Median: 8.4 hours .  
 
Half-life elimination:  Children and Adolescents: 22 hours (range: 20 to 24 hours) . 
 
Adults (foll owing a single dose): 22 hours (range: 17 to 24 hours)[2].

transplant. Rejection was prevented dur ing this treatment but occurred after discontinua tion of treatment. 
They  show ed that early blockade of complement activation by [CONTACT_426511] C1-inhibitor can 
prevent ac ute antibody -mediated rejection in presensitized recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840][3].  
 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Montgomery et al published a phase 2b, multicenter double -blind randomized  placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_426494] a-derived C1 esterase inhibitor (C1 INH) as  add-on therapy to 
standard of care  for AMR. Eighteen patients rec eived 20 ,000 units of C1 INH or placebo (C1 IN H n = 9, 
placebo n = 9) in divided doses every other day fo r 2 weeks. No discontinuations, graft losses, deaths, or 
study drug -related serious adverse eve nts occurred. While the study’s primary end point, a difference 
between groups in day [ADDRESS_538827] that C1 INH may be  useful 
in the treatment of AMR[4]. 
1.4 Dose Rationale  
The dosing that we propose to use in this stu dy is based on the regimen employed in the study by 
[CONTACT_426512]. In that study patients received C1 INH every other day 
for 2 weeks (total  of seven doses) as adjunct therapy to standard of care (SOC) with plasmapheresis(P P), 
IVIg, and/or anti -CD20 therapy (Rituximab ). Based on PK modeling in HAE patients and assuming that 
AMR patients have ongoing C1 INH consumption, the goal was to aim  for twice physiological C1 INH 
levels by [CONTACT_426513] o f 5000 U C1 INH (maximum of 100 U/kg) day 1 
after the diagnosis of AMR, followed by 2500 U C1 INH (maximum of 50 U/kg) or placebo on days 3, 5, 7, 
9, 11, and 13. Most patients in this study also received  PP every other day with one volume exchange 
replace d with albumin and crystalloid in mo st cases or fresh frozen plasma when indicated by [CONTACT_426514].   We propose a similar dosing regimen for this open -label 
study.

1.5.3  Potential benefits  
Untreated or inadequately treated antibody medi ated rejection can lead to failure of the kidney transplant 
and necessitate initiation or resumption of dialysis. Study subjects who receive Berinert may experience 
an improvement in their antibody mediated rejection of kidney transplant.  This could salvag e the kidney 
transplant and preclude all the risks associated with dialysis.

The primary objective will to assess the efficacy of C1 inhibitor, Berinert in inducing clinical and histologic 
resolution refractory acute of antibody mediated rejection (AMR) of kidney .  
 
The secondary objective will be to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, six month graft survival, to 
characterize incidence  of transplant glomerulopathy (TG)  and to assess the safety and tolerability of the 
proposed regimen  of C1 inhibitor.

C1 esterase inhibitor is a normal constituent of human plasma and belongs to the group of serine 
protease inhibitor s (serpi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]). As with the other inhibitors in this group, C1 esterase inhibitor has an 
important inhibiting potential on several of the major cascade systems of the human body, including the 
complement system and the fibrinolytic system. Berinert works by b locking the effects of complement 
protein, C1. C1 esterase inhibitors are approved for the treatment and prevention of attacks of hereditary 
angioedema by [CONTACT_1622]. The complement system is a group of proteins that are normally present in 
human blood. These  proteins play an important role in immunity against infectious disease. However, 
they also participate in rejection of transplanted organs. During rejection of a kidney transplant, activation 
of the complement system leads to injury and if insufficiently treated, ultimately to failure of the transplant. 
Therefore, inhibiting C1 is expected to prevent ongoing injury in kidney transplant that is being rejected 
and improve kidney function. Although the FDA has approved the use of C1 esterase inhibitors in 
hereditary angioedema, its use in individuals with antibody mediated rejection of the kidney transplant has 
not been approved by [CONTACT_1622]. A few patients with severe antibody mediated rejection have safely 
received this drug as part of research studies. Howeve r more evidence is needed before this drug can be 
approved by [CONTACT_426519]. Therefore subjects that 
are consented and enrolled to be part of this study will receive C1 esterase inhibitor for an off la bel 
indication.  
 
Each Berinert vial contains  500 IU of C1 esterase inhibitor as a lyophilized concentrate  
for reconstitution with 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP provided.

7 Safety and Adverse Events  
7.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
 
 
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic p rocedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considere d by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persisten t or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardiz e the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .

Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study peri od. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is  otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
The sponsor should also be notified if t he investigator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated 
in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be doc umented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a deg ree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426499] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any 
condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the conditio n meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426500] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266] r equired to allow efficacy measurement for the study.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426501] r.

form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one dia gnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the caus e.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatme nt or study participation should 
be recorded and reported immediately.

though  Investigators at participating sites are re sponsible for meeting the specific requirements of their 
IRB of record.  
 
Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to  submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later than  5 working 
days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
 Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent docu ment 
and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.   
– Related to the research procedures : An event is related to the research procedures  if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more  likely than not to be 
caused by [CONTACT_28821].   
– Harmful : either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 
Other Reportable events:  
The following events  also require prompt reporting  to the IRB , though  no later than  5 working days : 
 Complaint of a research subject  when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].

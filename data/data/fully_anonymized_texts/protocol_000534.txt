Title: A Study to Investigate the Effectiveness of the TENEO 317 Model 
2 (1.28 US) Excimer Laser for Laser In Situ Keratomileusis 
(LASIK) Surgery to Treat Myopia or Myopic Astigmatism  
Phase of study: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_239708]: Up to twelve (12) clinical centers in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_291050] eyes will be treated with a target of 300 
operative (study) eyes completing the study. 
Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of the TENEO 317 Model 2 (1.28 US) 
Excimer Laser in Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery for 
myopia or myopic astigmatism 
Indications for use: Myopia: -1.00 to -10.00 D 
Astigmatism: 0.0 D to   ̶ 3.0 D 
MRSE Treated: -1.0 D to   ̶ 11.50 D 
Study design: This will be a multicenter, prospective, open label, non-randomized, 
single arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the 
Technolas TENEO 317 Model 2 (version 1.28 US software) Excimer 
Laser when used in LASIK surgery to treat myopia or myopic 
astigmatism. Both eyes of a subject may be enrolled so long as both 
eyes meet all inclusion/exclusion requirements. 
The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be 
explained to the potential participant. The subject's willingness and 
ability to meet the follow-up requirements will be determined. 
When it has been established that the subject appears to be eligible 
and willing to participate, written informed consent (which includes 
consent to have photo and video recordings of the eye surgery 
made) will be obtained. Written informed consent will be obtained 
from each study subject prior to performing any study specific 
procedures which include items which are NOT part of the 
Investigator’s routine standard of care. In addition, written 
informed consent must be obtained prior to the day of surgery. A 
complete ophthalmic examination will be done at the Pre-Operative 
Visit scheduled within [ADDRESS_291051] eyes that meet eligibility criteria will be seen 
according to the following schedule:

 3. INTRODUCTION  
The Technolas Teneo 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US software [SW]) excimer laser is a 
scanning excimer laser that operates at the 193 nm ultraviolet wavelength to photoablate 
corneal tissue and employs a proprietary aspheric ablation profile rather than a 
conventional “Munnerlyn” ablation profile. By [CONTACT_60871] a small diameter beam (1 mm in 
diameter), the Teneo 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser offers the following 
advantageous features: 
 Flexible treatment patterns for the treatment of myopia  
 Wide ablation zones (up to 7 mm), and  
 A smooth ablation surface 
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_239710], with 
approximately 2.[ADDRESS_291072] 25 
years in the [LOCATION_002], wide use of refractive surgery (notable, laser in situ 
keratomileusis [LASIK] surgery).  Although anisometropia, predominantly myopia, may 
occur in young children as early as age 6, refractive surgery in the pediatric population is 
generally discouraged and LASIK surgery in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is not approved by [CONTACT_239749] [ADDRESS_291073] -1.0 D in a survey of 
29,281 persons 40 years of age and older was estimated as 25.4%, 26.0%, and 16.4% in 
2000. [ADDRESS_291074] -5.0 D of myopia (higher myopes) 
represented 4.5%, 4.6%, and 2.8% of patients. 1 A survey of the prevalence of refractive 
errors in occupants of Singapore in the Singapore Epi[INVESTIGATOR_239711] (SEED) 
Study, a multiethnic Asian population, gave rates among adults 40 years of age and older 
similar to that seen for the US, Western Europe, and Australia: 38.9% for myopia, 8.4% 
for high myopia, and 58.8% for astigmatism. 4 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291075] prevalence of myopia 
(18.5%), followed by [CONTACT_183734] (13.2%), African-Americans (6.6%) and Caucasians 
(4.4%). 8   
Refractive LASIK surgery patients in large retrospective clinical trials were relatively 
young in studies done in the [LOCATION_006] (mean age 35.6 years), 5 Israel (mean age 29.9 years), 6 
and Iran (mean age 29.4 years). [ADDRESS_291076] some degree of 
astigmatism ≥   ̶  0.25 cylinder error).  In a retrospective study in Iran, [ZIP_CODE] cases of 
compound myopic astigmatism (≥   ̶  0.25 sphere, ≥   ̶  0.25 cylinder error) were noted, 
while there were only 827 cases of simple myopia (≥   ̶  0.25 sphere, no cylinder error).7 In 
other data on myopic astigmatism, there were increases over time in rates of myopia and 
astigmatism in the SEED study, 4 with 72% of the increase in the rate of astigmatism due 
to myopic astigmatism.    
In summary, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_239712], include adult age groups, and are likely to have both sphere and 
cylinder refractive error.  Although minority populations have a higher rate of myopia in 
the US, their possible under-representation or even over-representation in this study cannot 
be predicted without a proper understanding of the demographics of patients serviced by 
[CONTACT_239750].  Nevertheless, the present study 
does not have an adequate sample size to power analyses at this level of demographic 
stratification.  
 History of LASIK: 
The first approach to myopic keratomileusis was developed by [CONTACT_239751] 1960s.10,[ADDRESS_291077] with an eight-bite anti-torque suture.11,12 This microkeratome required 
a great deal of experience to get reproducible results and freezing the lenticule caused death 
of the keratocytes and in some cases haze in the tissue.  Irregular astigmatism and the 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291078], it essentially sank into the depression created by [CONTACT_239752], 
creating a flatter corneal curvature.  This technique is referred to as Automated Lamellar 
Keratomileusis or ALK.11,14 The cornea remained clear but there were technical difficulties 
with the refractive cut.  Variability in the refractive keratectomy (second cut) thickness, 
diameter and centration led to overcorrection, undercorrection, or irregular astigmatism. 
To achieve the proper refractive keratectomy, the intraocular pressure needed to be above 
65 mmHg, otherwise a poor quality keratectomy was achieved.  Other variables included 
microkeratome blade quality, sharpness and width that also affected the predictability of 
the result. 
In 1983, Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) using an Argon Fluoride (ArF) Excimer 
Laser was first suggested by [CONTACT_239753].15-18  In 1992, Burrato used an Excimer 
Laser in conjunction with ALK by [CONTACT_239754] a cap with the automated microkeratome and 
treating the stromal surface of the cap with an Excimer Laser and replacing it without the 
use of sutures.19,20  In 1994, Brint used Burrato’s technique, treating the cap with an 
Excimer Laser, and in four eyes the ablation was performed in situ.21  They reported 
minimal corneal haze, good visual acuity and more predictable results than with a 
mechanical refractive cut.   
In 1991, Pallikaris coined the term LASIK, an acronym which stands for ‘Laser In-Situ 
Keratomileusis’, and reported using an excimer laser for LASIK of high myopes.22 In 1994, 
he compared the LASIK technique with surface photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and 
found in a small series that LASIK created less corneal haze, was more stable and had 
greater predictability than PRK.[ADDRESS_291079] the 
advantage over PRK with visual stabilization occurring earlier, with lesser tendency for 
regression.  The PRK subjects required topi[INVESTIGATOR_239713]. 
In 1992, the scanning spot excimer laser technique for the delivery of laser radiation for 
photoablation of corneal tissue began to appear in the literature.24 Results from preclinical 
tissue studies demonstrated that optical scanning delivery of excimer laser energy produces 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291080]-beam excimer laser system for laser 
assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) treatment of myopia/myopic astigmatism in 
1998,[ADDRESS_291081] scanning 
spot laser for LASIK in 2000.31 Today, virtually all excimer lasers systems used to perform 
LASIK surgery rely on computer-controlled scanning spot technology. 
 Risk/Benefit Analysis of LASIK 
The risks of performing LASIK on sighted eyes include improper correction, decrease in 
BSCVA, glare, halo, foreign body sensations, corneal scarring, corneal ulceration or 
perforation, intraocular infection, corneal decompensation, persistent corneal edema, 
hyphema, hypopyon, endophthalmitis, microbial keratitis,[ADDRESS_291082] / misplaced / misaligned flap, dry eye, or melting of the flap. 
Steps taken to mitigate the risks associated with this protocol include  
 enlisting only Investigators with prior training and experience in corneal refractive 
surgery, including experience with: (a) the use of femtosecond laser “flap makers” 
and (b) laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) ensuring that Investigators 
review and understand this investigational protocol; and  
 monitoring the study for adherence to the protocol and verifying all incidences of 
adverse effects are reported.  During the period when study procedures and/or study 
sites are interrupted by [CONTACT_25963]-19 pandemic (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), monitoring 
may occur remotely.  
The principle benefit of an aspheric LASIK procedure is the potential freedom from or 
reduced dependence on spectacles (glasses) and/or contact [CONTACT_239755]. LASIK may be safer than contact [CONTACT_239756].[ADDRESS_291083] safety and effectiveness

 5. STUDY DESIGN 
 Justification of Study Design  
The TENEO 317 Model 2 excimer laser workstation received CE Mark status in Europe in 
2017 and is currently running version 1.28 software (SW). The difference between the EU 
version 1.[ADDRESS_291084] software 
treatment capabilities other than myopic LASIK with or without astigmatism that will be 
disabled on all Technolas TENEO 317 Model 2 systems to be used in this myopia/myopic 
astigmatism study. 
A retrospective post-CE Mark chart review provides evidence of the safety and effective 
performance of the TENEO [ADDRESS_291085] and Africa.33 
Of the 518 eyes enrolled in the chart review, 72 eyes had spherical myopia and 446 eyes 
had myopic astigmatism. 
In the chart review report, 93% of subject eyes were 20/20 or better at > 1 mo, and 99% were 20/32 or better at > 1 mo.  Further, 100% of subject eyes had uncorrected distance 
visual acuity of 20/[ADDRESS_291086]-market study that demonstrated excellent results for spherical 
correction and showed a slight under-correction for cylinder. As a result, the laser’s internal 
cylinder conversion factor for the PROSCAN version 1.27.[ADDRESS_291087] guidelines. The study treatment range (indication for use) includes up to MRSE  
-11.[ADDRESS_291088] 300 study eyes evaluable at the 
final visit. Every effort will be made to enroll approximately the same number of eyes at 
each investigational site.  The additional 34 study eyes will allow for losses up to 10% due 
to early subject discontinuation. Both eyes of a subject may be enrolled. Subjects will be 
permitted to have both eyes enrolled so long as both eyes meet all inclusion/exclusion 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291089] eyes with sphere of -1.0 D up to -10.00 D, cylinder

 5.2.1 Fellow Eye Treatments  
Because unilateral enrollment would result in subjects with a significant degree of 
anisometropia, and the safety and effectiveness of the TENEO 317 Model 2 excimer laser 
(ver. 1.28 US SW) specific to the treatment of myopia or myopic astigmatism are supported 
by [CONTACT_239758], bilateral LASIK treatments will be permitted in this study. Both eyes 
may be enrolled for efficacy and safety assessments if the subject is fully informed that the 
surgical risks apply equally to each eye. If an intraoperative complication or adverse event 
occurs in the first eye, treatment must be abandoned in the second eye. Each eye treated 
according to this protocol for an enrolled subject will be reported on separately and 
included in the data analysis. 
5.2.2 Enhancement and Retreatment Procedures 
If the treated eye remains under-corrected and/or corneal haze or vision regression 
decreases to UDVA of 20/[ADDRESS_291094] Subjective Patient Questionnaire 
(PROWL)34-[ADDRESS_291095]-operative PROWL (Patient Reported Outcomes with LASIK) 
questionnaires were developed and validated to sample patient impressions of LASIK 
surgery adequacy for improved vision and activities such as night driving, sports, etc. 
dependent on good patient vision.  Select PROWL questions and domains will be analyzed 
for this study, not the PROWL-PRQ and PROWL-POQ questionnaires in their entirety.  
However, the entire PROWL questionnaires are included in this study since they were 
validated as such.36,[ADDRESS_291096] subjective 
preoperative and postoperative impressions of their LASIK surgery36,37 (including clusters 
of questions or domains for vision clarity, far vision, near vision, patient satisfaction with 
vision and with surgery, and quality of life) and patient-perceived safety assessments (i.e., 
driving, dry eye [OSDI domains 1 and 3],38,39 and the frequency, severity, and bothersomeness of visual symptoms) will be analyzed as described in Section 8.5  and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_291097] in a secluded area, free of 
directions from clinical staff.

Subjects failing to meet eligibility criteria prior to scheduling of surgery are considered 
screen failures. 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291105] is considered 
enrolled in the study at the time they sign the informed consent form (which includes 
consent to have photo and video recordings of the eye surgery made), with the study eye 
selected by [CONTACT_239761] (Pre-operative).  It is understood the 
number of subject eyes enrolled at the first study visit may be slightly more than the target 
number of [ADDRESS_291106] be discontinued prior 
to the final study visit if they voluntarily withdraw for any reason, it is the Investigator’s 
decision that it is not in the best medical interest of the subject to continue participation in 
the study, or in the event of death of the subject. 
Prior to discontinuing a subject who voluntarily withdraws, every effort should be made to 
contact [CONTACT_423], schedule a final study visit, and obtain as much follow-up data as 
possible. Regardless of the patient voluntary withdrawal, adverse events should continue 
to be followed by [CONTACT_239762] . Subject withdrawals 
will be documented clearly on the source document and applicable eCRF. 
Discontinued subjects who withdraw consent should be followed outside of the study 
protocol according to the Investigator’s normal post-operative standard of care. 
A Study Exit eCRF must be completed for all subjects who discontinue from the clinical 
investigation.  The reasons for subject withdrawal and discontinuation of any subject will 
be documented clearly on the applicable eCRF and recorded. 
Subjects who discontinue the study prior to the surgical procedure will be considered 
screen failures and will not be recorded on the eCRF. Subjects who are discontinued 
during/after study LASIK surgery will not be replaced. 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291107]’s source documents, and the applicable eCRFs will be completed. Documentation 
of the contact [CONTACT_239763], if appropriate, a copy of the certified letter will be maintained 
in the subject’s study file.  It is expected that lost to follow-up subjects will comprise < 
10% of all study eyes. 
The exit date for subjects who are lost to follow-up will be the date of the last study visit 
(scheduled or unscheduled) attended by [CONTACT_423]. 
 Investigators 
The clinical trial will be conducted at up to [ADDRESS_291108] ISO [ZIP_CODE] “Clinical Investigation of 
Medical Devices for Human Subjects - Good Clinical Practice” (ISO GCP) and 
FDA/CDRH Medical Device Regulations. 
A TPV Engineer in conjunction with the Bausch & Lomb Training Team, will conduct 
Physician and staff training at each site on the operation and use of the TENEO [ADDRESS_291109] 
discontinuation, reporting of AEs and protocol deviations.  
In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely 
discontinue this study either at a single site or at all sites at any time and for any reason. If 
such action is taken, Sponsor will discuss this with the investigator (including the reasons 
for taking such action) at that time. Sponsor will promptly inform all other investigators 
and/or institutions conducting the study if the study is suspended or terminated for safety 
reasons and will also inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or termination of 
the study and the reason(s) for the action. If required by [CONTACT_5279], the 
investigator must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason for the suspension

more than 15% of total enrollment.  Efforts will be made by [CONTACT_239764].  
 Study Duration 
Eligible subject eyes that are enrolled into the study will be seen for approximately [ADDRESS_291111] Medical Device 
Like its parent device (Technolas 217z Excimer Laser System), the TENEO 317 Model 2 
(ver. 1.28 US SW) Excimer Laser Workstation is an ophthalmologic system based on 
excimer laser technology used for refractive surgery that offers very precise pre-
programmed ablation patterns to reshape the cornea of the human eye. The TENEO 317 
Model 2 (ver. 1.27.2 SW EU) received CE Mark approval in Europe in 2017. The TENEO 
317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser employs optical scanning technology 
operating at 193 nm ultraviolet wavelength to photo-ablate corneal tissue and imparts a 
proprietary aspheric ablation profile. The TENEO 317 Model 2 system employs a small 
laser spot (1 mm diameter), a randomized laser spot targeting pattern at 500 Hz, and a beam 
fluence of 200 mJ/cm2. Three different auxiliary lasers are used in the TENEO [ADDRESS_291112] the surgeon in aiming the treatment beam correctly on the eye to be 
treated. Since the excimer laser emits in the invisible UV range at a wavelength of 193 nm, 
an aiming laser (aiming beam) consisting of a red diode laser is coupled coaxially with the 
treatment beam. Additionally, there is a fixation laser which is a red flashing laser diode 
that provides a fixation target for the subject eye during the surgery. A focusing laser which 
is generated by a green diode laser serves to align the treatment level. Other main features 
of TENEO 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser are: 
 Flying Spot technology provided by [CONTACT_239765].  
 Short treatment times by 500 Hz technology with 1 mm laser spots.  
 Precision for positioning of the laser pulse due to state of the art dynamic rotational 
eye tracking and z-axis tracking.

  Standard treatment with an asphericity algorithm taking into account the pre-
operative asphericity of the cornea and the surgically induced spherical  
aberration. 
 
Other hardware modifications have been made to the TENEO [ADDRESS_291113] been tested and verified in a series of non-clinical studies conducted to 
verify design output meets the design input requirements. 
 Instructions for Use and Administration 
The TENEO 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser will be used to perform all 
myopia and myopic astigmatism LASIK procedures during this study and use instructions 
are described in detail in Appendix  C of this investigational plan.   The graphical user 
interface (GUI) for the investigational 1.28 US SW can only present treatments for 
spherical myopia and myopic astigmatism indications. All other indications for use are 
disabled, are not visible as potential treatment options, and cannot be enabled by [CONTACT_239766]. 
The TENEO 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser system alignment verification 
for laser spot accuracy and cylinder axis alignment will be done upon installation of the 
TENEO 317 Model 2 excimer laser and again at intervals detailed in the Instructions for 
Use for the laser system found in Appendix C . 
All Investigators will be provided with detailed instructions on configuring the laser system; 
control of environmental conditions during LASIK surgery including humidity and 
temperature parameters and control; specification of auxiliary surgical devices to be used 
(see Section 6.3 and  Appendix B ); and pre-operative measurements to be taken to develop 
the customized treatment plan for each subject.  All in-clinic pre-operative procedures, 
operative procedures (including LASIK surgeries), and post-operative procedures during 
the COVID-19 pandemic will be conducted in accordance with medical guidance to reduce 
risk of COVID-19 transmission between study staff and subjects (available at 
www.aao.org/covid-19 ).  Local, state, and federal public health guidances also will be followed during the COVID-19 pandemic (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS], 7.1.4, 7.1.5, [IP_ADDRESS], and 
[IP_ADDRESS] for additional information related to trial conduct changes during the COVID-[ADDRESS_291114] safety and well-being as well as data 
integrity). 
Note: Measurements also will be taken upon the device installation to ensure that 
illumination levels that reach the retina (i.e., due to aiming beams, fixation lights, 
microscope illumination, or secondary radiation from the treatment beam) are held as low 
as possible. Illumination levels for the operation microscope shall conform to the limits set

If the subject should return at any time other than the protocol-prescribed scheduled visits, 
the visit will be documented as an unscheduled visit. All visits, scheduled or unscheduled, 
must be reported to the Sponsor on the appropriate Case Report Forms (CRF). 
7.1.1 Pre-operative Visit 1 – Day -[ADDRESS_291124], the Investigator (or designee) will explain 
the purpose of the study, study procedures, risks/benefits, and study responsibilities to the 
potential subject. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow-up requirements 
of the study will be determined. Patients that appear to be eligible will be approached for 
study participation and sign a written Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to the 
commencement of study related procedures. The written ICF includes an addendum section 
that provides subject consent to have photo and video recordings of the eye surgery made.  
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the Investigator performing study 
specific procedures that are NOT part of his/her routine standard of care.  
The subject or his/her legal representative and the person obtaining written consent will 
sign and date the IRB/IEC approved ICF. The original signed document will be retained in 
the subject records, and a copy will be provided to the subject. Subjects will be given ample 
time to review the ICF before signing it. 
In addition, the applicable privacy regulation requirements must be met (e.g. Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] authorization). Research subjects 
treated at clinical sites located in areas that have additional local requirements will be 
provided with the required additional local information (e.g. local Bill of Rights). 
After providing written informed consent, prospective subjects will be screened to 
determine whether they meet the entry criteria for the study. Ocular medications used for 
the study eyes will be documented in the subject source document and the appropriate 
eCRF, and demographic information will be collected. The pre-operative clinical 
evaluation will consist of a complete ophthalmic examination conducted at least one but 
no more than [ADDRESS_291125] of the following:

7.1.2 Operative Visit 2 – Day 0  
Subjects will return to the clinic and be reassessed to confirm eligibility (i.e., confirm that 
there have been no changes since the Pre-Operative Visit that would make the subject 
ineligible). If the subject is no longer eligible or is unable to attend Operative Visit [ADDRESS_291126] be 
discontinued (refer to Section 5.3.4  and Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). If the subject is eligible, surgery 
will be performed using the surgical procedure described in Appendix  C.  If Operative 
Visit [ADDRESS_291127] may be rescreened for eligibility so long 
as the inclusion/exclusion requirements of Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  are met. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ocular Medications  
Ocular medications used for eyes of enrolled subjects and any AEs must be documented in 
the subject source document and reported as appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Surgical Technique 
Eligible subjects will undergo a LASIK surgical procedure with the TENEO 317 Model 2 
(ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser device on one or both eyes. In no case should a concurrent 
bilateral procedure be attempted if there are problems or complications during the surgical 
procedure for the initial subject eye. The minimum diameter of the optical zone, the degree 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291128] refraction and mesopic pupil size. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_239716] 317 Model 2 (1.28 US) laser treatments of myopia or 
myopic astigmatism performed outside of the US have been approximately between 6.0 
mm and 7.0 mm; however, the 1.28 US software will permit treatments of mesopic pupil 
sizes within the range of 4.5 mm to 7.0 mm. Operator attempts to enter an OZ size outside 
this range results in a prompt, “out of range”. If the corneal flap created is smaller than 
the treatment zone size, the procedure will be cancelled.  The default treatment 
parameters (K = 43.3 D, Q = -0.20), not the measured pre-operative keratometry (K) and 
asphericity (Q) values, will be manually entered into the Teneo 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US 
SW) excimer laser system. This information is used to develop a laser ablation pattern that 
removes tissue based on an aspheric algorithm, and additional peripheral tissue removal 
necessary to achieve the desired post-operative corneal surface asphericity. 
Treatment plans for all eyes undergoing LASIK surgery are strongly recommended 
to be targeted for emmetropia 
For expected residual postoperative cylindrical refractive error of ≥ 1.0 D or spherical 
refractive error of ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_291129] should be given the opportunity to experience his/her 
best spectacle vision with anticipated correction only and be willing to proceed with the 
surgery.  
Details of the surgical technique are described in Appendix C . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Operative Report 
The following information is to be obtained intraoperatively and recorded for all enrolled 
eyes (i.e., first or both eyes): 
 Operative eye  
 Treatment type  
 Targeted refractive outcome  
 Optical zone  
 LASIK ablation (anticipated residual corneal thickness following LASIK surgery)  
 Central and maximum ablation depth  
 Type of femtosecond laser, anticipated flap thickness and diameter  
 Operative lamellar / ablation complications  
 Procedure aborted (if applicable)  
 Recording of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediately Post-Surgery 
The treated eyes are managed with medications (e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory drops, and any other medicines prescribed at the physician's discretion), 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291130] lens, and/or punctal plugs as per the treating physician ’s usual regimen. 
The subject is instructed to return in [ADDRESS_291131]-operative Visits – Days 1 to Month 9 
Subjects will be followed for six (6) post-operative visits.  Recording of ocular medications 
used for subject eyes enrolled and any AEs or complications/possible AEs in the subject 
source document and appropriate eCRF must be continued throughout the course of the 
study. Each eye that is enrolled is examined independently. 
The following measures are to be included at the follow-up in-clinic examinations for all 
treated eyes of participating subjects.  If a subject cannot receive timely safety assessments 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, protocol deviations will occur and the processes described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  are to be followed until such time as the subject can 
be seen at an in-clinic visit and planned examinations can occur within the appropriate visit

for description), a Telephone Contact [CONTACT_239769] a scheduled follow-up visit.  The option of using telemedicine 
contacts during an in-window period for a subject rather than a clinic visit will be with the 
best judgment of an Investigator in light of prioritizing subject safety as well as adherence 
to local, state, and federal guidelines related to COVID-[ADDRESS_291137] in-window (for a visit that would 
have been missed due to COVID-19 disruption) , will be notified to visit the site, albeit 
OOW, to complete their missed visit assessments if possible. When possible, the above 
assessments will be conducted out of window at a clinical site (due to the COVID-19 
pandemic disruption) as though they were in window, so long as they occur prior to the 
opening of the window of the next planned study visit. If an out of window visit due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic cannot occur before the next study visit window, the study visit will 
be considered missed (see Section 7.1.5 ).   
This OOW study visit to complete the missed assessments will now be recorded as an 
Unscheduled Visit (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further explanation about conduct and recording 
of out of window study visits during the COVID-19 pandemic). In the event an OOW

7.2.1 Early Study Termination 
If during the study the Sponsor determines that the study should be stopped prematurely, 
the study will be terminated or suspended, and appropriate notification will be given to the 
Investigator(s), IRB and FDA, as applicable. Bausch + Lomb or its representative will 
instruct the Investigators to stop the study treatment, to assure appropriate therapy and 
follow-up for the subjects, and to arrange for study closeout at each site as appropriate. 
 Concomitant Medications/Therapy 
The Investigator may use any medications or treatment that is judged necessary, 
appropriate, and beneficial to the subject.  
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291140] during this study for the treatment 
of operative eyes (with the exception of the surgeon’s standard regimen for pre-, intra- and 
post-operative medications) will be made on the appropriate sections of the eCRFs. 
 Protocol Deviations 
As required under §21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)&(4), an Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
and reviewing IRB of any deviation from the investigational plan intended to protect the 
life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. The date of and reason for protocol 
deviations will be documented in all cases. Significant or major protocol deviations 
affecting the safety, rights, and welfare of the subject or the integrity of the study must be 
reported by [CONTACT_239771]. Reporting of all other protocol 
deviations must adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB. 
Protocol assessments will continue until the end of the study, unless the protocol deviations 
put the subject at risk or the subject’s condition requires that he/she should be discontinued 
from the study. 
7.4.1 Protocol Deviations During COVID-19 National Health Emergency 
[IP_ADDRESS] Introduction 
On January 31, 2020, the [LOCATION_002] Secretary for the Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS) declared a public health emergency because of the global spread of 
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections, also known as the coronavirus infectious disease 
2019 (COVID-19).  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-
[ADDRESS_291141] of the Sponsor sent a letter to all clinical 
sites to stop enrollment for the 884 study.  The letter notified the clinical site Investigators 
that the Sponsor is suspending #884 study enrollment and asked the Investigators to cancel 
any pending treatments until further notice.   For site questions regarding currently-enrolled 
and treated subjects, the site staff was made aware the Sponsor was available to support 
them, as was the Medical Monitor.  For study subjects already treated, the Investigators 
were asked to keep detailed documentation, including annotation of the subjects’ medical 
record and case report form, when connecting with study subjects and following reporting 
requirements of any protocol deviation related to COVID-19 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

 [IP_ADDRESS] Guidance for Protocol Deviations Related to COVID-19 Pandemic 
Because all study #884 clinics paused study-related activities for 7 weeks or more 
following guidance from the US government relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
Sponsor provided:  
 guidance to the study Investigators on how to handle the halt in enrollment and 
management of in-clinic study visits and an alternative if a subject is unable to visit 
the clinic. 
 an addendum for how to complete the eCRF in response to the limited data 
collection or visits impacted by [CONTACT_25963]-19 pandemic, 
 a unique template for telephone contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic,  
 an example for completing the protocol deviation form with COVID-19 disruption 
information, and 
 subject contact [CONTACT_239772]-[ADDRESS_291142] on the study.  
The Sponsor will require that all out of window visits as described in Section 7.1.4 make 
use of the above tools and be reinterpreted to account for any delayed Visits and in office 
assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic disruption according to the following 
guidance: 
 If the patient is unable to visit the practice in the designated protocol window, a 
Telephone Contact (TC) will be made if possible to collect health changes and 
medication changes. A TC status form will be initiated, and a Protocol Deviation 
will be filled out for the TC with the reason being due to COVID-19 disruption if 
applicable.  
 Visits intended to fulfill protocol visit requirements that fall outside the 
designated scheduled visit interval due to the inability of the patient to be seen in 
the office will now be collected and all assessments that were intended to be 
completed in-window will be done and the data transcribed on the Unscheduled 
Visit eCRF.   
 The Telephone contact [CONTACT_239773] 
A Protocol Deviation will no longer be recorded for the Unscheduled Visit (with 
the reason being “due to COVID-19 disruption” if applicable). All out of window 
visit data (COVID related and otherwise) will now be recorded on the 
Unscheduled Visit eCRF. 
Any out of window study visits occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the  
clinic of an Investigator is allowed to reopen for non-essential study visits and surgery 
according to the current rules and regulations of the Investigator’s state, the FDA, and the 
DHHS will be processed as described in Sections 7.1.3-7.1.5 and associated protocol 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291143] signs the informed consent form. Refer to Table 2 for instructions on events that 
require expedited reporting to the Sponsor. 
For the purposes of this study, adverse safety events are defined broadly to include a range 
of events encompassing four hierarchical categories of risk,  Adverse Events (AE), 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE), Complications/Potential Adverse Events, 
and Symptoms, each having an associated level of required CRF/IRB/Sponsor/FDA 
reporting (See Table 2Table 2.  Safety Event Reporting, “Safety Event Reporting”). 
The first category, AEs, represents the key safety events that are surveilled during the study 
(Section 8.1 ). The second category ( Section 8.2 ), UADEs, represent rare unanticipated 
safety events directly attributable to the device.

 Tertiary safety events include anticipated Complications/Possible Adverse Events known 
to occur following laser refractive surgery ( Section 8.4 ), and subjective Symptoms 
reported by [CONTACT_1766] ( Section 8.5 ). 
A representative list of safety events that are associated with each risk category are 
summarized in Sections 8.1–8.5 below: 
 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) as defined in ISO standard [ZIP_CODE] is “ any untoward medical 
occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal 
laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device .” 
The following AEs are the key safety events surveilled during the study. Each occurrence

or safety or represent any life-threatening problem or death caused by [CONTACT_8121], if the 
event has not previously been identified in the investigational plan or in Section 8.[ADDRESS_291146] be recorded in both the AE & UADE CRFs 
within [ADDRESS_291147] 10 working days to report the occurrence 
of a UADE to the Sponsor (via UADE CRF), and thereafter the Sponsor has 10 working 
days to report the UADE to the FDA, the IRB and all study Investigators. (see Table 2Table 
2.  Safety Event Reporting , “Safety Event Reporting”) as described in 21 CFR 
812.150(b)(1). UADEs may include, but are not limited to, the following events: 
 Device related death 
 Enucleation of treated eye  
 Corneal transplant of treated eye 
 Reporting Device Deficiencies 
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
 
Investigators must evaluate, record, and report via applicable forms any 
complaints/deficiencies or malfunctions experienced with Test Device during this trial to 
the Sponsor or its representative promptly.   The Sponsor shall review all device deficiency 
reports and, upon the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any additional 
information related to the safety reporting of a particular event.

 Symptoms 
Subjects will complete subject PROWL questionnaires at the preoperative visit and each 
scheduled study visit from the 3-month postoperative visit on. The PROWL questionnaires 
should be completed by [CONTACT_239777] a secluded area, free of directions from clinical 
staff.   Subjects will be asked to complete all PROWL questions to the best of their ability, 
and only certain PROWL domains will be analyzed for the purposes of this protocol.  For 
domains dealing with symptoms and specifically evaluated with the PROWL questionnaire 
for this study, patients will grade the frequency, severity and inconvenience 
(bothersomeness) of their glare, halos, double images, and starburst visual symptoms as 
part of the PROWL symptom domain (questions 45-64 in the PROWL-PRQ34 
questionnaire and questions 42-61 in the PROWL-POQ35 questionnaire). Results from 
domain 1 (visual function) and domain 3 (environmental stimuli) of the Ocular Surface 
Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire 41 (questions 65-72 of the PROWL-PRQ34 
questionnaire and question 62-69 of the PROWL-POQ35 questionnaire) also will be

 Sample Size 
9.3.1 Assumptions 
Prior clinical experience with the TENEO 317 excimer laser in Europe showed that 94.5% 
of eyes were within 0.50 D and 99% of eyes were within 1.00 D of targeted MRSE 1 month 
after surgery. In addition, 100% of eyes achieved UDVA of 20/40 or better at 1 month.33

9.3.5 Overall Enrollment 
Approximately three hundred thirty-four eyes (334) eyes will be treated to evaluate 300 
eyes at the time of refractive stability, as recommended by [CONTACT_239778] Z80.11-2012 
(R2017)[ADDRESS_291154]. This will allow for losses of up to 10%.  Enrollment will be monitored 
to achieve the minimum marginal distribution of pre-operative refractive errors given for 
study eyes in 
Enrollment will be successive without staging of enrollment since substantial prior clinical 
experience with the TENEO 317 model 2 excimer laser was obtained after the device

B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291156] Z80.11-2012 (R2017)40.  By [CONTACT_239780], initial attainment of 
refractive stability is accepted at the latter of two postoperative refractions performed at 
least 3 months apart or at 3 months after surgery when compared with the 1-month interval, 
if all recommended criteria for refractive stability are met.40  
[IP_ADDRESS] Percentage of eyes that achieve predictability of MRSE within ± 0.[ADDRESS_291157] refraction will be assessed at all scheduled 
visits beginning with the Week 1 Visit.  
For each observation, attempted MRSE and MRSE at the time of refractive stability will 
be computed in diopters as follows.  
𝑀𝑅𝑆𝐸 = 𝑆𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 +𝐶𝑦𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟
2 
For each observation, the absolute difference (|ΔMRSE|) between the attempted MRSE 
and observed MRSE at the stability visit will be computed as follows.  
|∆𝑀𝑅𝑆𝐸| = |𝑀𝑅𝑆𝐸 𝑎𝑡 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑉𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑡−𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑀𝑅𝑆𝐸|  
 
Each observation will be classified as shown in the following example.  
Condition Classification 
|ΔMRSE| ≤ 0.50 D MRSE within ± 0.50 D 
|ΔMRSE| > 0.50 D MRSE not within ± 0.50 D 
 
Predictability of MRSE within 0.50 D will be summarized categorically (MRSE within   ± 
0.50 D, MRSE not within ± 0.50 D) for the treated eyes population at the stability visit in 
a Table. 
Prior to hypothesis testing, missing sphere and cylinder values at postoperative scheduled 
visits will be imputed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Details of the 
MCMC method to be used will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291158] the statistical hypotheses. If the percentage of observations within 
± 0.50 D of attempted at the time of refractive stability is statistically significantly greater 
than 80%, then the device will be statistically successful in this outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Percentage of eyes that achieve predictability of MRSE within ± 1.00 D 
at the time of refractive stability 
The methods described in the previous section will be employed in the evaluation of this 
endpoint.  If the percentage of observations within ± 1.00 D of attempted at the time of 
refractive stability is statistically significantly greater than 90%, then the device will be 
statistically successful in this outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Percentage of eyes targeted for emmetropia that achieve UDVA of 
20/40 or better at the time of refractive stability 
UDVA will be assessed at all scheduled postoperative visits using an ETDRS chart. The 
data entered into the case report form will be converted to logMAR UDVA.  
Each observation will be classified as follows. 
Condition Classification logMAR UDVA ≤ 0.3 UDVA 20/40 or Better 
logMAR UDVA > 0.3 UDVA Worse than 20/40 
UDVA will be summarized categorically (UDVA 20/40 or Better, UDVA Worse than 
20/40) for the treated eyes population at the stability visit in a table.  Prior to hypothesis 
testing, missing logMAR UDVA values at postoperative scheduled visits will be imputed 
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Details of the MCMC method to be 
used will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.  Binomial proportions and standard 
errors will be combined using multiple imputation analysis methods to test the statistical 
hypotheses. If the percentage of observations with UDVA 20/40 or Better at the time of 
refractive stability is statistically significantly greater than 88%, then the device will be 
statistically successful in this outcome.

 Appendix B. Description of the Investigative Device and Methods of Clinical 
Evaluation 
1.0 TENEO 317 MODEL 2 EXCIMER LASER DESCRIPTION 
The Teneo 317 Model 2 excimer laser consists of the following system components: 
1.1 Excimer Laser Head: 
The laser head provides the following output characteristics: 
 
Laser medium:   ArF 
Laser wavelength:   193 nm  
Gas mixture:    Argon / Fluorine / Neon   
Operating fill pressure:  6 bar 
Repetition rate:   500 Hz 
Power:     < 10.000 mW 
Pulse width (duration):  8 ± 3 ns 
Emergent beam size (VxH):  6 x 3 mm 
Beam divergence (VxH):  51 x 27 mrad 
Fluence on cornea:   200 mJ/cm2 
1.2 Laser Gas System 
Included in the laser system is a gas bottle of the laser gas mixture with Argon, Fluorine and Neon. 
Additionally, there is another gas bottle containing Nitrogen gas, which is used for flushing the 
beam path and gas system for installation and service and an ongoing gas exchange inside the 
sealed beam path. Components of the gas system include automatic valve, pressure reducer, 
pressure sensors (high/low pressure section), vacuum pump, fluorine filter, computer-controlled 
gas delivery. 
1.[ADDRESS_291176] eye to be treated.  
 
 I/O (Input/Output) Board and Scanner Drivers 
The I/O (Input/Output) Board receives and sends signals to the computer, as well as controlling 
components of the system, such as turning on and off the laser radiation, opening and closing the 
shutter.  Furthermore, the energy delivered to the eye is monitored.

       TENEO 317 1.28 US                           CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 77 
 1.4 Laser Beam Delivery System  
The laser beam delivery system consists of aperture, two safety shutters, focusing lens, 
galvanometers with scanning mirrors, and two 45 -deflection mirrors. The main functions of the 
beam delivery system are to shape the laser beam to the proper size and beam profile, and direct 
the laser pulses by [CONTACT_239798]. 
1.[ADDRESS_291177]-doctor interface include the patient bed 
with a joystick, operating microscope with a centration reticule, illumination light, diode-laser for 
fixation light, diode-laser for focus and aiming light, plume evacuator, footswitch for shutter / 
laser-control, computer keyboard, touchscreen, laser emission indicator, key-switch (on/off) and 
emergency stop, USB ports for user key and USB storage device. 
1.[ADDRESS_291178] the users and subjects from electric and radiation 
hazards.  Access is only possible by [CONTACT_2329] a special tool to open the covers.  The electronic 
components are connected with shielded cable. Isolation transformers and line filters are used for 
the electric power lines.   
1.7 Power Stability 
The power stability unit consists of a closed-loop energy check system that verifies pulse energy 
at different control points along the sealed beam path, adjusting pulse energy throughout the 
treatment and maintaining consistent laser energy output from the laser head. 
1.8 Electrical Safety  
The Teneo 317 Model 2 excimer laser system is designed to meet  the ISO/IEC standard [ZIP_CODE]-1 
(Edition 3.1): Medical Electrical Equipment – Part 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and 
Essential Performance. 
1.9 Radiation Disabling 
Laser radiation is prevented from exiting the laser system in certain situations, such as in the 
following cases: 
(1) The physician detects a non-optimal event, i.e., eye movement, and releases the footswitch, 
(2) The Eye tracker detects eye movements out of predefined ranges, 
(3) The plume evacuator failure is detected, 
(4) When the energy is out of the expected range, 
(5) When the surgery is completed, 
B+L Study # 884 Protocol  Ver 8.0  Bausch Health Research and Development     
       TENEO 317 1.28 US                           CONFIDENTIAL Page 62 of 77 
 (6) When the Emergency stop button is pushed, and 
(7) an optional remote interlock is activated. 
The shutter has been tested to be able to block the laser radiation in <50 msec.  In addition, there 
are two shutter position sensors, one for the “open” and another for the “closed” position. If the 
computer receives an incorrect position signal, the laser head is shut down. 
1.10 Eye Tracking  
The TENEO 317 eye tracker (ET) is essentially the same as the approved 217z ET module, as both 
systems perform real-time (dynamic) adjustments to laser pulse positioning in response to intra-
procedure eye movements. The ET for the TENEO 317 was updated to accommodate the faster 
repetition rate of the 317 laser (laser frequency TENEO 317: 500Hz vs. 217z: Hz100Hz; ET frequency TENEO 317: 1.740Hz vs. 217z: 240Hz), otherwise the following description applies to 
both ET modules.  
The lateral (X/Y) eye tracker (ET) uses a co-axial infrared camera to follow movements of the 
pupil in order to provide positioning information to the laser system. The eye tracking system scans 
the image and determines the location of the center of gravity of the pupil. The center of the pupil 
is provided as a feedback to the computer which corrects the laser beam position to match the 
detected pupil center position. Should the cornea leave the predefined interval in X/Y, the laser 
system stops the application of pulses until the cornea is repositioned inside the acceptance range. 
A second rotational/Z camera, tilted 12° to the optical axis, detects the changing angle for torsional 
tracking. The computer corrects the laser beam position via the scanning system to match the 
calculated position. Should the cornea exceed a predefined angle, the laser stops the application of 
pulses until the cornea rotation angle is within the accepted range. 
 
Lastly, the ET utilizes a passive Z-tracking feature which uses information from both camera 
systems (X/Y) and torsional tracker to determine the position of the cornea in the axial (Z-
direction) direction based on triangulation. Should the cornea leave the predefined interval in Z, 
the laser system stops the application of pulses until the cornea is repositioned within the accepted 
range.   
 1.11 Plume Evacuator 
The Teneo 317 Model 2 excimer laser integrated plume evacuator system removes debris from a 
region above the surgical field and avoids the distribution of the debris into the surgery room 
during the ablation process. It is placed close to the ablation level to evacuate plume as effectively 
as possible through an integrated nozzle. If the suction nozzle is not in the treatment position, or 
suction flow fails during treatment the laser stops the application of pulses until the fault condition 
is resolved.

       TENEO 317 1.28 US                           CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 of 77 
 1.12  Slit Lamp 
An optional slit lamp is integrated in the system. The slit can be adapted in width and position to 
be able to examine the patient’s eye after flap repositioning after the excimer laser procedure has 
been completed.  
 
2.0   CREATION OF THE CORNEAL FLAP FOR LASIK 
The creation of the required corneal flap will be performed with a femtosecond laser.  Any 
commercially approved femtosecond laser can be used to create the corneal flap prior to LASIK 
treatment. 
3.0 THE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH LASIK (PROWL) 
QUESTIONNAIRE  
All subjects will complete the PROWL-PRQ Questionnaire [ADDRESS_291179]-
operative study visits. Note the entire PROWL questionnaire will be administered, mean values 
by [CONTACT_239799], and only specific questions relating to 
specific patient-centric domains described in Section 5.2.3, Section 8.5,  and/or Section [IP_ADDRESS].1  
will be scored and analyzed.   Questionnaires will be completed independently by [CONTACT_132149] a 
private space at the beginning of each applicable visit, prior to other study assessments being 
performed. The PROWL-PRQ Questionnaire will be given once, at the pre-operative screening 
visit (Day -60 to Day -1), and the PROWL-POQ Questionnaire will be given at every study visit 
beginning with Visit 6 (3 months, Week 10-14) until the subject exits the study. 
Subjects should be instructed to complete as many of the questions as possible by [CONTACT_239800], with an estimated completion time for each Questionnaire of 
about 30 minutes. Subjects will be asked to read each question carefully and answer as appropriate 
for how they feel – there are no right or wrong answers. Subjects will be told the test coordinator 
will not be present during the completion of the Questionnaire and cannot provide any guidance 
on how to answer any questions. If a subject is not sure of an answer, they should be encouraged 
to guess at an answer that seems right to them. When done, the test should be given to the study 
coordinator. 
4.[ADDRESS_291180] will be measured at the pre-operative Visit 
1 (Screening) and not at any additional study visits unless indicated to assess anomalous results in 
the post-operative period.  The same pachymeter and keratometer should be used for all 
pachymetry and keratometry measurements, respectively, on each individual eye at a clinical site. 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291181] 
using the topographer / ultrasonic device of their choice. This pachymetry measurement should be 
done in perpendicular alignment with the central cornea.  Each eye corneal thickness will be 
recorded in the subject source documents and eCRFs, and the TENEO [ADDRESS_291182] by [CONTACT_224026]. The axis 
and degree (in diopters) of the steep and flat axis of the cornea will be recorded. 
5.[ADDRESS_291183] eyes will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening) and at Visit 5 (Month 1) 
through Visit 8 (Month 9), or through the last study visit (whichever comes first). Corneal 
topography is to be measured prior to any study procedures requiring dilation of the eye or any 
procedure that requires touching the surface of the eye.  The same topographer should be used for 
all measurements on each individual eye at a clinical site.    Investigators may use any 
commercially available corneal topographer to obtain corneal curvature, asphericity, and 
pachymetry measurements of subject eyes. The make and model of the system used will be 
recorded in the CRFs.  Each subject eye asphericity Q value provided by [CONTACT_239801], and the TENEO [ADDRESS_291184] ± 0.1 mm.  Pupil size will be 
measured under photopic conditions or in a darkened room using a handheld infrared pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187] 
(preferably a Colvard pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187], Oasis Medical, Glendora, CA or VIP-300 pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187], 
Neuroptics, Laguna Hills, CA).  If the Neuroptics VIP-300 pupi[INVESTIGATOR_239729], the settings for 
measurement should be with the Variable Mode On, not Light Off , and data collected and entered 
in the EDC system using the Low Mesopic instrument reading.  
Pupil measurement will be initiated only after the eye has had time to fully adapt to the testing 
conditions (approximately 10 minutes). The Teneo 317 Model 2 (ver. 1.28 US SW) excimer laser 
limits the mesopic pupil sizes that may be treated from a minimum of 4.5 mm to a maximum of 
7.0 mm. Operator attempts to enter an OZ outside this range will result in a pop-up message, “out-
of-range.” 
7.[ADDRESS_291185] refraction (MR) 
measurements. These measurements will be obtained by a qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist, 
or trained ophthalmic technician only. At no time during the study will auto-refraction be 
utilized as a final endpoint refraction. Auto-refractor or lensometer readings may only be 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291186] be manually refracted to his/her best correction by [CONTACT_4674], 
optometrist, or a skilled technician using the ETDRS chart at 4 meters with a phoropter or trial 
frame under photopic lighting conditions.  All refractions will be conducted in a manner consistent 
with the site’s standard techniques using 0.[ADDRESS_291187] refraction obtained using the ETDRS chart at 4 meters is adjusted for optical 
infinity by [CONTACT_18647] 0.25 D from the sphere value. The ‘Chart R’ with Sloan letters will be used 
to obtain the manifest refraction. The manifest refraction which has been adjusted for optical 
infinity will be documented on the Sponsor-supplied refraction worksheet. The manifest refraction 
which has been adjusted for optical infinity should be used as the basis for laser refractive treatment.   
The resulting manifest refraction will be placed in a trial frame and utilized to obtain BSCVA 
results. For testing at 4 meters, a +0.[ADDRESS_291188] the 
testing distance to optical infinity. If for some reason (e.g., dense cataract), MR cannot be obtained, 
the results should be documented as ND as indicated above and not entered as zeros. In the event 
of this occurrence, BSCVA will not be tested and the reason for ND will be required in the source 
document and in the eCRF. 
NOTE: Contact [CONTACT_239802] a stable refraction (within ± 0.50 D) in the 
operable eye(s), as determined by [CONTACT_239803]. Stability of the refraction 
is determined under the following conditions: 
 Lenses are not worn for at least 2 weeks (rigid or toric contact [CONTACT_13276]) or 3 days (soft contact 
[CONTACT_13276]) prior to the first refraction used to establish stability and through the day of surgery; 
 The two refractions are performed at least [ADDRESS_291189] lens wear for the duration of the study. 
8.0  VISUAL ACUITY 
8.1 Uncorrected Near and Distance Visual Acuity (UDVA) and Best Spectacle-Corrected 
Distance Visual Acuity (BSCVA) Testing 
It is essential that these standard procedures be used to obtain VA measurements. The VA 
measurements will be obtained by a qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist, or trained ophthalmic 
technician. Prior to any potential subject testing, the Sponsor or its representative will certify the 
site is suitably staffed and equipped to conduct all necessary VA testing. 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291190] Refraction is not obtainable, BSCVA will not be tested. The results should be 
documented as Not Done (ND) and not entered as zeros. The reason it was not obtainable must be 
recorded in the source document and in the eCRF.  The Investigator should also consider whether 
or not failure to obtain Manifest Refraction is appropriate for recording as an AE. 
First, the right eye is tested at 40 cm with an appropriate ETDRS chart scaled for near reading and 
then for the left eye at 40 cm with an appropriately scaled ETDRS chart.  Then, the right eye is 
tested at 4 meters with ETDRS Chart 1, and then the left eye is tested at 4 meters with ETDRS 
Chart 2. A +0.[ADDRESS_291191] for the difference between the testing distance and optical infinity; similarly, a +0.[ADDRESS_291192]'s eyes remain at the specified distance. 
The subject should be told that the chart has letters only and no numbers. If the subject forgets this 
instruction and reads a number, remind the subject that the chart contains no numbers and the 
examiner should request a letter in lieu of the number. 
The subject should be asked to read slowly (at a rate not faster than about one letter per second) in 
order to achieve the best identification of each letter and to not proceed until the subject has given 
a definite response. 
Examiners should never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart or read any of the letters 
during the test. Each letter is scored as right or wrong. Once a subject has identified a letter with a 
definite single-letter response and has read the next letter, a correction of the previous letter cannot 
be accepted. If the subject changes a response aloud (e.g., "That was a 'C,’ not an 'O’.”) before the 
next letter is read aloud, then the change should be accepted. If the subject changes a response 
after beginning to read the next letter, the change is not accepted. 
When the subject says a letter cannot be read, the subject should be encouraged to guess. If the 
subject identifies a letter as one of two or more letters, ask the subject to choose one letter and, if 
necessary, to guess even if the next letter has already been read. If the subject does turn their head, 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291193] from reading the chart with the fellow eye. 
Before testing BSCVA at 1 meter, a +0.75 D sphere should be added to the 4-meter correction 
already in the trial frame to compensate for the closer testing distance. Note that the 4-meter 
correction includes +0.[ADDRESS_291194] refraction.   
Before testing UDVA at 1 meter, a +1.[ADDRESS_291195] 
not move their head. (As indicated above, the subject should be seated comfortably with their back 
firmly placed against the back of the chair.) The avoidance of any head movement forward or 
backward is particularly important during the closer testing range.  
The subject should be asked to read only the first six lines at 1meter distance, making [ADDRESS_291196] is unable to read the chart at 4meters 
then move the chart closer. 
8.1.2 Scoring and Recording Visual Acuity Values 
The scoring and recording of visual acuity values will be done by [CONTACT_239804]. 
8.1.3 Illumination of the ETDRS Chart and Examination Room  
The optimal ETDRS illumination level is approximately 85 cd/m² and all sites must ensure they 
are consistently as close as possible to this level through all visual acuity and refraction testing.

 9.0  SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION  
The slit lamp examination will be performed using a slit lamp biomicroscope and observations 
will be graded per the classification of slit lamp observations as described below. Additional 
observations/abnormalities can be reported on the eCRF and graded as appropriate.

Pre-operative and post-operative (Month 6) corneal endothelial cell densities will be measured by 
[CONTACT_239810] (regardless whether one or both eyes are treated) of up to 
approximately [ADDRESS_291199] images.  Documentation of such training and 
qualifications will be maintained in the site files.  The ECD technicians should be delegated as a 
primary or back-up technician, with the primary ECD technician obtaining ECD images whenever 
possible and the back-up technician obtaining ECD images as necessary in lieu of the primary 
technician.

of the ECD in the central cornea will be performed preoperatively and at six months 
postoperatively (Visit 7) using a non-contact [CONTACT_239811] (approved by [CONTACT_239812]). Three images from the central part of the cornea will be obtained for each applicable 
subject visit and forwarded to the central reading center according to the center’s instructions.  
 
To determine ECD, sites will submit all preoperative and Month 6 postoperative images to the 
reading center (which will be masked) for image analysis.  The reading center will determine the 
mean ECD based on the three images.

 13.0  INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (TONOMETRY) 
The measurement of eye pressure is part of a routine eye examination in which the IOP is 
determined. Goldmann applanation tonometry is the most accurate method and as such is the 
preferred method for study subjects. However, if an alternative method (e.g., Tonopen) is required 
at any site, it will be allowed. In any event, the same testing method is to be employed for all study 
visits for each subject to facilitate reliable comparisons from visit to visit.  If cycloplegic refraction 
is measured the same day as IOP, the intraocular pressure should be measured following the 
refraction to avoid disturbing the corneal surface.

1% is added in the lacrimal sac of the eye intended to undergo LASIK surgery, repeated again 3-
[ADDRESS_291205] refraction, and collection and recording 
of the refraction data, should be conducted no sooner than 20 minutes after the second drop of 
cyclopentolate 1% has been instilled.  This procedure should be performed only after examinations 
and procedures not requiring pupil dilation have been completed at the relevant (i.e., the first and 
last) study visit.  Subjects should be cautioned following cycloplegic refraction to wear sunglasses, 
avoid excessive sun exposure, and avoid tasks that require near vision for 6-12 hours.  
15.0 DILATED FUNDUS EXAMINATION 
Using an ophthalmoscope and the Investigator’s preferred lens, light is shone into the eye, allowing 
the retina and the optic nerve to be examined. Any “abnormal” findings will be thoroughly 
documented and, as appropriate, rated in severity. The Investigator will classify findings as follows:

2.0  LASIK SURGICAL TECHNIQUE 
The surgical technique consists of ablating tissue from the stroma after having created a flap of 
corneal tissue with a femtosecond laser.  The flap is folded back exposing the central cornea where 
the excimer laser will ablate the stromal tissue. The shape of the ablated area for myopia is 
achieved by [CONTACT_239813]. The shape of the ablated area for astigmatism is achieved by [CONTACT_239814]. The surgery performed, and particularly the size of 
the optical zone, will be determined by [CONTACT_239815], the pupil size, 
the central pre-operative corneal thickness (as measured by [CONTACT_239816]), flap thickness and 
amount of residual corneal tissue (residual corneal thickness should be no less than 250 microns).  
3.[ADDRESS_291206] is given topi[INVESTIGATOR_239737] (e.g., antibiotic, analgesic, and/or sedative) 
at the physician’s discretion prior to the procedure. The subject is properly positioned on the 
excimer laser operating platform directly under the operating microscope. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_239738]-operative eye is covered with an occlusive 
patch. The surgeon prepares the operative eye for the procedure and makes the adjustments 
necessary to insure that the operative eye is properly positioned for the keratectomy. 
B+L Study # [ADDRESS_291207] is 
moved upwards to insert the patient interface into the suction clip. After complete docking, the 
femtosecond laser application will be performed based on the physician’s assessment of the eye to 
be treated. 
4.[ADDRESS_291208]’s MRSE and astigmatism such that the optical zone 
is equal to or greater than the mesopic pupil size. Corneal topography data for each eye of a subject 
will be collected at the pre-operative study visit and recorded on the TENEO model 2 excimer 
laser; these data will be source data for the LASIK surgery.  The subject is properly positioned on 
the excimer laser operating platform directly under the operating microscope. A speculum is 
placed so the laser ablation zone is constantly exposed and the subject is cautioned to not move.  
The Investigator may apply one or more medications to the eye while the subject is under the 
excimer laser. Once the surgical field is within focus, the surgeon engages the eye tracker system 
to track the lateral (X/Y) shift of the pupil center by [CONTACT_239817] (X/Y) tracker and the torsional 
misalignment by [CONTACT_239818]. The corneal flap is lifted up and folded to one side exposing 
the stromal surface. The surgeon superimposes the two intersecting laser focus beams to ensure 
that the surgical field is within focus. With the subject fixating on the fixation light, and the eye 
tracker ‘locked-on’ to the subject’s pupil, the excimer laser surgery is performed.  
If unacceptable subject movement occurs and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_239739], the TENEO 317 laser 
X/Y Eye Tracker will automatically pause the procedure. The surgeon may also halt the procedure 
at any time by [CONTACT_239819]. The procedure can be resumed 
at the exact point where the pause occurred once the eye tracker detects pupi[INVESTIGATOR_239740]. 
After the treatment, the corneal flap is repositioned in place. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_239741],

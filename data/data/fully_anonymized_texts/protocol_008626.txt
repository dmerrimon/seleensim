will receive either active OVB/placebo MDI, or placebo slurry/active MDI, in double 
blind fashion.  
Statistical 
Methodology  To test whether OVB is more effective than fluticasone MDI for improving 
eosinophil counts, the mean post -treatment maximum eosinophil count will be 
compared between the OVB and MDI groups using a two -sample t -test. To test 
whether OVB results in less symp tomatic recurrence than fluticasone MDI,  
survival analysis will be performed with the interval between treatment end (week 
8) and recurrent symptoms  or study end (week 60) as the time of interest.  
Symptoms will be measured with the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire, a 
validated instrument in EoE.

CONFIDENTIAL  1   Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good  Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference 
on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Eosinophilic esophagitis is a previously rare condition w ith a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_238555] (EoE) is an immune -mediated 
clinicopath ologic entity whereby [CONTACT_238600], progressive esophageal stenosis, and food  
impaction.1-[ADDRESS_288956] five to ten years  (Figure 1) .6-9 
Because EoE is chronic, the prevalence is also  
increasing.6, 7, 10, 11 Overall, between 5% and 16% of 
patients undergoing endoscopy for dysphagia will have 
EoE,12-15 and more than 50% of patients presenting to 
an emergency room with food impaction are now 
diagnosed with EoE.3, [ADDRESS_288957] pain.2, 20, 21 When suggestive 
symptoms are present, upper endoscopy with  biopsy 
is required to make the diagnosis.2 Endoscopic 
signs of  EoE can include esophageal rings, 
strictures, luminal  narrowing, linear f urrows, white 
plaques or exudates, and a  loss of vascularity  
(Figure 2) .1, 18, 22, 23 On esophageal biopsy,

of other conditions that may cause esophageal eosinophilia  before a diagnosis of EoE can be formally 
confirmed.

Version: March 14, [ADDRESS_288961] that EoE has become a major cause of upper gastrointestinal morbidity in both children 
and adults, the approach to treatment of EoE is rudimentary and evidence to guide practice is sorely 
needed (Table 2). Because data suggest that a Th2 -mediated response to allergic pathogens governs 
esophageal eosinophil infiltration,[ADDRESS_288962] been specifically 
formulated for EoE, patients are pre scribed asthma preparations such as fluticasone in a multi -dose 
inhaler (MDI) or aqueous budesonide. Patients are asked to swallow, rather than inhale, these 
medications to coat the esophagus and provide a topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -inflammatory effect. For fluticasone MDI, 
patients puff the medication into their mouth during a breath hold and then swallow it.26, 27 For aqueous 
budesonide, patients mix the liquid into a slurry with a sugar substitute such as sucralose and then 
swallow it; this has been termed “oral visco us budesonide,”  or OVB.28, [ADDRESS_288963] now 
shown that these treatment strategies can be effective for decreasing  levels of esophageal eosinophilia 
and improving symptoms related to EoE.26, 29, 30, 38, 39 However, the dose  ranges, length of treatments, 
method of drug delivery, assess ment of symptoms, and patient inclusion criteria  vary widely between 
these studies,25 so studies cannot be directly compared to draw conclusions about  efficacy.  
 
Table 2: Major unanswered questions regarding EoE treatment  
1) What topi[INVESTIGATOR_238557]?  
Importance : Doctors do not know what medication to use first.  
2) After an initial treatment course, what is the durability of 
response?  
Importance : Patients cannot be properly informed about 
treatment outcomes and symptom recurrence.  
3) Which patients are most likely to respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_030]?  
Importance : Patients who might not respond are subjected to 
unnecessary steroid exposure and provision of non -steroid 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_238558].  
 
The most effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_238559] a first line agent in EoE is unknown  
A major gap in the current knowledge regarding EoE treatment is that it is unknown which topi[INVESTIGATOR_238560]. Because of this, practitioners do not know what medication to use first and cannot 
provide  accurate information to patients about treatment outcomes. In a study of patterns of practice 
related to EoE  performed by [CONTACT_27156], the vast majority of gastroenterologists who prescribed a topi[INVESTIGATOR_238561].40 However, this choice is not supported by 
[CONTACT_238601], and it is unknown whether a different medication such as OVB might be 
more effective.  This question has substantial practical implications. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_238562], with 13% to  50% of subjects failing to respond depending on the study and outcome measure.26,

The dura bility of the treatment response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_238563]. The few 
data available regarding durability of response are inconclusive. In a r etrospective trial of adults treated 
with an  initial two -week course of fluticasone MDI, 29 of 32 patients reported recurrent dysphagia at a

CONFIDENTIAL  mean of 9  months.44 In a prospective trial, subjects who 
previously responded to a two -week course of nebulized the n 
swallowed budesonide were randomized to low dose 
budesonide or to placebo.45 After 50 weeks of treatment,  all 
14 patients in the placebo arm had recurrent esophageal 
eosinophilia, and the median time to symptom  relapse was 95 
days. However, in this study  the initial treatment course (2 
weeks) was shorter than the current  accepted standard of [ADDRESS_288965] likely to respond.2 Candidate biomarkers for 
prediction of treatment response can be selected based o n the pathophysiology  of EoE  (Figure 3) . The 
presence of eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa is abnormal,47,[ADDRESS_288966] a Th2 -mediated response to allergen sensitization governs esophageal eosinophil infiltration and

chemokine which is increased 50 -fold in patients with EoE compared to controls.56-60 Once activated, 
eosinophils degranulate and release factors such as major basic protein (MBP), which can disrupt

1.2 Investigational Agent s 
Oral viscous budesonide  (OVB) is a swallowed, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] , steroid slurry .  We will  formulate this to be  
equivalent  to what is used clinically: 1 mg/4 mL aqueous budesonide mixed with 10 g of sucralose.28, 29, 42  
Rather than  asking the subjects to mix the slurry on their own and risk inconsistent formulations, a 
weakness of prior  studie s, the UNC investigational drug service (IDS ) will provide pre -mixed OVB to all 
patients. For the purposes of compounding the medication to be dispensed as a one -month supply, the 
constituent elements of aqueous budesonide are combined in bulk with sucralo se to yield the necessary 
concentration and consistenc y.  The dose for OVB has been chosen because it is the most commonly 
studied dose, including our prior study, so we can accurately estimate response rates.28, 29, 39, 42  Subjects  
randomized to this arm will also be instructed to use a placebo inhaler identical to the fluticasone MDI, 
with instructions t o swallow 4 puffs twice daily.

CONFIDENTIAL  Fluticasone MDI  is also topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560] .  Subjects will swallow at a dose of 880 mcg twice daily (4 puffs of 
a 220 mcg inhaler twice daily) .  The dose for fluticasone MDI has been chosen because this is the most 
commonly used dose in adolescents and adults with EoE, so effect estimates are also a vailable.2, 25, 27, 101  
Subjects randomized to this arm will also be instructed to take 4 mL twice daily of a placebo sl urry of 
sucralose identical in consistency and taste to the OVB.  
1.3 Preclinical Data  
Preliminary data and study feasibility  
The number of EoE cases seen at UNC continues to increase, providing an expanding source population 
for the proposed study. Through th e UNC Center for Esophageal Diseases and Swallowing (CEDAS), 
one of the  largest esophageal referral centers in the country, and two UNC GI procedure units, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_16884] 
a rich patient  population to draw from for research. Over the past 7 years,  there has bee n a trend towards 
an increasing number of EoE  cases, including more than 65 new (incident) cases of EoE  annually for the 
past 3 years (Table 3). In addition, the number  of cases in patients 16 years and older, the study 
population for  this trial represents  the majority of these cases, and  is similarly increasing. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_238566]. This  latter resource now 
has complete clinical and histologic  information on more than 400 patients with Eo E.

In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_50506] a prospective study of  the prevalence of esophageal 
eosinophilia  and EoE in the UNC GI procedure units. Of 173 patients undergoing endoscopy for 
dysphagia, 65 (38%) had  esophageal eosinophilia with ≥ 15 eos/hpf, and 40 (23%) were confirmed to 
have a new diagnosis of EoE after  a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_238567] (Table 1).[ADDRESS_288971] been excellent, indicating that 
EoE patients seen by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_238568] . In the 
PI’s prospective study of eosinophil inflammation  and activation funded by [CONTACT_238602]2 
award  (KL2 RR025746), a total of 276 patients were approached for screening and 223 (81%) agreed to 
participate.  In the PI’s prospective study of risk factors and biomarkers for diagnosis of EoE funded  by [CONTACT_238603] K23 award  (K23 DK90073), a total of [ADDRESS_288972] been screened to date with only 8 (5%) 
refusals. For both of  these studies, patients undergoing outpatient upper endoscopy were approached for 
the first time prior to the  procedure, and were remarkably willing to participate. For patients newly 
diagnosed with EoE, rates are even  better. In the randomized study of OVB vs nebulized/swallowed 
budesonide that we conducted (see below), a  total of [ADDRESS_288973] approached 14 patients with EoE for 
participation; only one patient refused to be enrolled. These high  recruitment rates demonstrate the 
Budesonide vs Fluticasone Protocol – TREET Trial   Page 7 
Version: March 14, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  feasibility and high likelihood of enrolling EoE patients into the proposed trial  at UNC. To further confirm 
this, we performed a feasibility assessment for the proposed study. A total of 20  patients who met this 
study’s inclusion criteria were approached and 19 (95%) indicated that they  would be willing to be 
randomized.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_238569] f or determining esophageal eosinophil counts, the primary 
histologic outcome used in clinical trials of EoE . Because esophageal eosinophilia is required for 
diagnosis of  EoE and is central to the pathophysiology of the condition, the eosinophil count is the  most 
commonly used  outcome for EoE treatment trials. In early work, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_238570] a number of 
shortcomings in the way in which  eosinophil counts had been determined, including inconsistent 
methodology to quantify cells and variable  definitions of microscope high -power fields.[ADDRESS_288974] ([CONTACT_238633]), a protocol using digitized histology slides 
to quantify eosinophil counts was  developed and validated. This method has been documented to ha ve 
excellent intra - and inter -observer  reliability for determining cell counts (see appendix and Aim 1 methods, 
below),[ADDRESS_288975] such measure that  is available.99 This is a daily symptom diary with three 
questions that assess  the frequency and severity of dysphagia. The one and two week  composite scores 
strongly correlate with the frequency of dysphagia, distinguish patients on topi[INVESTIGATOR_238571] (by [CONTACT_238604]), and strongly correlate with a  dysphagia 
measure that has been responsive in a previous trial of EoE.30 This instrument will form the basis of  the 
symptom analysis used for the prop osed study.  
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_238572], demonstrating that OVB is 
superior to nebulized/swallowed budesonide for improving 
esophageal eosinophilia . In this study, a visc ous slurry of budesonide 
(OVB) was compared with budesonide that was nebulized and then 
swallowed (NEB).[ADDRESS_288976] -treatment esophageal 
eosinophil counts were significantly lower  in the OVB group 
compared with NEB  (Figure 4) . Second, this response was largely 
explained by [CONTACT_238605]  
(Figure 5) . Specifically, the OVB group had a significantly higher 
esophageal medication contact [CONTACT_5586] (as me asured by [CONTACT_238606]) compared with the NEB group. 
Responders in both groups had increased esophageal medication 
contact [CONTACT_238607] -responders.  
 
Figure 4 :  Histologic response in EoE 
with NEB vs OVB.  Baseline eosinophil 
counts (blue bars) are similar between 
OVB and NEB.  After treatment  (green 
bars) , there is near normalization of the 
eosinophil count in OVB, but no change 
in NEB .

Version: March 14, [ADDRESS_288977] conducted two case -
control studies of  the utility of using immunohistochem istry (IHC) to 
stain  esophageal biopsies for biomarkers to diagnose EoE. In  the 
first, tryptase was used to stain mast cells, and this  stain had an 
excellent utility for distinguishing EoE and  GERD patients 
(area under the receiver operator  characteristic curve (AUC) 
= 0.84).69 In the second, both  MBP and eotaxin -3 were 
assessed, and the combination  of these two stains had 
outstanding utility for diagnosing  EoE (AUC = 0.96).[ADDRESS_288978] technical

diagnosis of EoE.  
 
Preliminary data suggest that increased staining of  eotaxin -[ADDRESS_288979] promise for this. Using stored 
samples in the UNC EoE Registry and Biobank, we  identified 
patients who did (n = 20) and did not (n = 20) have a 
complete histologic response (defined as < 5  eos/hpf) to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_238573]. We stained the baseline (pre -steroid treatment) biopsies for MBP, eotaxin - 3, and 
mast cell tryptase. The results showed that EoE patients who responded to topi[INVESTIGATOR_238574] 5 :  Representative nuclear scintigraphic

eotaxin -3 and t ryptase than did pati ents who 
did not respond (Figure 7) .  This wa s not the 
case with MBP. While the underlying 
mechanism for this finding is not known, we  
hypothesize that patients with a more 
inflammatory milieu in the esophagus as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_238608] -[ADDRESS_288982] 
treatment response,2 it is not surpri sing that  
MBP was not associated with treatment 
response.  However, we plan to include MBP 
in our panel of  biomarkers to confirm our 
finding and to provide a  negative control stain. 
These preliminary data provide  justification for 
including Aim 3 in the pro posed study.  
1.5 Dose Rationale  and Risk/Benefits  
OVB dose of 1 mg twice daily is a slurry equivalent to what is used clinically: 1mg/4mL aqueous 
budesonide mixed with [ADDRESS_288983] 
commonly studied dose, including our prior study, so we can acc urately estimate response rates. 28,29,39,42  
 
Fluticasone MDI dose of 880 mcg twice daily (4 puffs of a 220 mcg inhaler twice daily) has been chosen 
because this is the most commonly used dose in adolescents and adults  with EoE, so effect estimates 
are al so available.2, 25, 27, [ADDRESS_288984], the MDI will be administered 15 minutes later, and 
patients will take nothing by [CONTACT_238609] 30 minutes. This schedule is based on our previously 
published esoph ageal emptying data for OVB demonstrating that the half -life for OVB in the esophagus is 
<[ADDRESS_288985] been shown to be well -tolerated in several prior studies 
of EoE when  compared to placebo , 26,29,38,39 adverse  effects are still possible. Local effects such as mouth 
irritation or  sore throat are expected in less than 5% of subjects. Oral candidiasis is also expected in less 
than 5% of  subjects. Candidal esophagitis can occur in 10 -20% of subj ects treated with swallowed 
corticosteroids,  with most cases detected on follow -up endoscopy. This is readily treated with an 
antifungal agent such as  nystatin or fluconazole.  Adrenal insufficiency is a theoretic concern with any 
corticosteroid medication . However, at the doses proposed for this study and with an [ADDRESS_288986] not been reported with initial short -term topi[INVESTIGATOR_238575].26,29,38,39,42 It is important  to note that while there are some risks associated with taking these 
medications , for patients diagnosed  with EoE it is likely that they would be treated with one of these 
agents even if they were not participating in  this study, so the medication risks related to the study are 
may not be higher than those of routine clinical  care.

eos/hpf). Eosinophil  counts will be determined by [CONTACT_238610] (baseline) 
and post -treatment exams  using our previously validated protocol.82 In brief, 4 esophageal biopsies will 
be obtained from both the distal  (3 cm above the gastroesophageal junction) and proximal (15 cm above 
the junction) esophagus to maximize  sensitivity of detecting eosinophils.102 On each  biopsy fragment, 5 
high-power fields (hpf area = 0.24mm2) will  be examined and the maximum eosinophil count determined 
at each level. The overall maximum count in the  esophagus will be the primary outcome measure 
because there is no consensus in the liter ature about what  eosinophil cut -point constitutes a “histologic 
non-responder” and different studies use different definitions.25, 103  
 
The co -primary outcome for the study will  be the dysphagia score, as measured by [CONTACT_64676].99 This is a 
composite score  generated by a symptom diary completed daily over the two weeks immediately prior to 
randomization (weeks  -2 to 0) such that baseline symptoms take into account any dilation performed at 
the screening endoscopy.  The diary will be repeated over the two weeks  immediately prior to the follow 
endoscopy (weeks 6 -8). Subjects  will be automatically emailed a daily secure link to the three question 
survey to complete each night. The DSQ score (range: 0 -6; higher is more severe) is calculated by 
[CONTACT_238611] t he daily  scores by [CONTACT_238612]. The two -week 
observation period will minimize  the effect of symptom variation.  Subjects will also be given the option of 
completing the diary and questionnaires on paper ; capturing th e date and time of each response.

CONFIDENTIAL  Pre-specified secondary outcomes  include: 1) Endoscopic findings of EoE, including esophageal rings, 
white plaques/exudates, linear furrows, edema/decreased vascularity, and strictures, will be measured 
using the recently  validated EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS);104 2) Levels of histologic 
response (ie <15 eos/hpf ; 3) Medication compliance as measured by [CONTACT_238613] ; and 4) symptoms of dysphagia as measured by [CONTACT_238614] (EEsAI).  
3.3 Aim 2  Study Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes to be assessed under Aim 2 are:  
- Symptomatic recurrence  will be defined as at least a [ADDRESS_288988] meets the criteria for recurrent symptoms.  
 
- Histologic recurrence  will be defined as recurrent esophageal eosinophilia ≥1 5 eos/hpf. This will be 
detected  on the follow -up endoscopy, using the identical biopsy protocol and pathology interpretation 
protocol as  described in Aim 1.  
 
- Other secondary outcomes  will include: 1) Endoscopic findings of EoE measured by [CONTACT_238615]; and  2) 
Levels  of recurrent esophageal eosinophilia as measured by [CONTACT_238616] (eos/hpf).  
 
3.4 Aim 3 Study Outcomes  
For the IHC sub -analysis to be performed after study completion, the exploratory outcome of h istologic 
response  will be defined as a maximum eosinophil count < 15 eos/hpf on post -treatment biopsies (the 
same definition asin Aim 1).  
For the methods, q uantification  of IHC staining  will be performed with a protocol that mirrors the one used 
for the eosinophil  counts and that has been successfully used in our previous studies.62, 69, 82 The IHC 
glass slides will be scanned, converted to digital slides, and viewed with Aperio ImageScope (Aperio 
Technologies, Vista, CA).[ADDRESS_288989] in the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_238576]  (cells/mm2) in five microscopy fields using the

CONFIDENTIAL  7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
The overall study is powered for the co -primary histologic and symptom outcomes .  Based on estimates 
of histologic improvements from our study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_238585] (Table 4),26, 27, 29, 39, 41, 42, 101, 105 we estimate that 
average baseline maximum eosinophil counts will be 80 eos/hpf a nd that average post -treatment 
maximum eosinophil counts will be 10 ± 10 eos/hpf in the OVB arm and 20 ± 20 eos/hpf in the fluticasone 
MDI arm.  To detect this different with a power of 0.9, 53 subjects per arm are needed (Table 5).  
Assuming a drop -out ra te of 15%, which is what we observed in our budesonide trial,[ADDRESS_289006] two years (Table 
3) and is a realistic goal.   
 
For Aim 2, b ased on estimates in the literature, we would expect  at least 80% of subjects in the OVB 
arm,29, 30, 39, [ADDRESS_289007] 50% of subjects in the fluticasone MDI arm,26, 27, 41, 101, [ADDRESS_289008] a 
symptomatic and histologic response (<15 eos/hpf) after the initial treatment period.  Therefore, 
approximately 42 subjects in the OVB arm and 27 subjects in the MDI arm will enter the follow -up period.  
There are no prospective comparative data on symptomatic or histologic recurrence rates for these two 
medications.  However, based on these sample sizes and estimating a recurrence rate of 80% in the MDI 
group, we would be able to detect a hazard ratio for symptomatic recurrence of 0.[ADDRESS_289009] 
a difference as low as 36% with a power of 0.[ADDRESS_289010] 60% of subjects 
in the OVB arm,29, 39, 42 and 40% of subjects in the MDI arm,26, 27, 41, 101, [ADDRESS_289011] a complete histologic 
response of <5 eos/hpf.  Therefore, we expect a total of [ADDRESS_289012] a differen ce between the responders and non -responders 
as low as 100 cells/mm2 for tryptase staining and 1250 cells/mm2 for eotaxin -[ADDRESS_289013] to see a difference in MBP staining, with this sample size we would be 
powered to find a difference of 750 cells/mm2 or greater if such a difference exists

CONFIDENTIAL  tests will be two -sided with a significance level set at p < 0.05.  To account for the possibility that baseline 
subject characteristics are unevenly dis tributed between study groups, we will perform an additional 
analysis with multiple linear regression to control for possible confounders including co -existing atopic 
disease (asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, food allergies), symptom  duration prior to 
diagnosis, esophageal stricture on baseline endoscopy, and esophageal dilation on baseline endoscopy.  
 
For Aim 2, to test whether OVB results in less symptomatic recurrence than fluticasone MDI, survival 
analysis will be performed with t he interval between treatment end (week 8) and recurrent symptoms or 
study end (week 60) as the time of interest.  A Kaplan -Meier curve will be constructed comparing the time 
until symptom recurrence in both study groups using the log -rank test.  Hazard ra tios will be calculated 
using Cox proportional hazards models, and we will adjust for potential confounders including age, 
gender, atopic status, symptom duration prior to EoE diagnosis, and presence of esophageal strictures on 
endoscopy.  To test whether OVB results in less histologic recurrence than fluticasone MDI, the 
proportion of subjects with ≥15 eos/hpf at follow -up endoscopy in each group will be compared using chi -
square.  This analysis cannot be time -dependent because the eosinophil count is not known for all 
subjects until the follow -up exam is complete.  
 
For Aim 3, t o test the hypothesis that elevated levels of eotaxin -[ADDRESS_289015] response.  
For this, logistic regression modeling will be performed controlling for factors such as age, gender, atopic 
status, symptom duration prior to EoE diagnosis, and presence o f esophageal strictures on endoscopy.  
For the secondary analyses, we will assess staining using other levels of histologic response (partial 
response with 5 -14 eos/hpf and non -response with ≥15 eos/hpf) and by [CONTACT_238627][INVESTIGATOR_27560] 
(OVB vs flutic asone MDI).  We will also determine if baseline staining was associated with decreased 
post-treatment symptoms of dysphagia measured by [CONTACT_64676], and whether the biomarkers correlate with 
each other.  For all analyses, if data distributions are not normal, non-parametric testing will be used. All 
tests will be two -sided with a significance level set at p < 0.05.  
7.[ADDRESS_289016] Population(s) for Analysis  
The subject population for analysis will be by [CONTACT_7586] -to-treat, and will include all patients who are 
randomiz ed and who complete the protocol to have follow -up data available.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865])  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly rel ated means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156],  
 Suggests that the research places  subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psych ological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including 
any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, experience, or 
disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the re search, whether or not considered 
related to the subject’ s participation in the research.  Adverse events encompass both physical and 
Budesonide vs Fluticasone Protocol – TREET Trial   Page 9 
Version: March 14, [ADDRESS_289017] ic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is consi dered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persi stent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria  for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
Serious vs. Severe  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not sev erity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
Any adverse event caused by a drug.  An ADR can be considered a “suspected” adverse drug reaction  if 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug cause d the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse drug reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent wit h the applicable product 
information (e.g. package insert or investigator’s brochure).  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedur es to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_289018] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start o f the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
  
Budesonide vs Fluticasone Protocol – TREET Trial   Page 10 
Version: March 14, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant a bnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Ad verse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct ea ch subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator 
should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurri ng at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor 
should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital ano maly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the  drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28688] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for 
and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be re ported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205271] d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_238586], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
8.[ADDRESS_289019] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case re port 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period  
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be 
recorded and reported immediately.

be reported are those that are:  
 related to study participation,  
 unexpected, and  
 serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section  8.1).   
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the 
initial report includes:  
 Study identifier  
 Study Center  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset   Current status  
 Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
 
8.3.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Any study -related unanticipated proble m posing risk of harm to subjects or others, and any type of study -
related serious adverse event, must be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the 
event.  To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form must be completed by [CONTACT_238628] [ADDRESS_289021] issued guidance that clarifies that investigators need only report 
“unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” (or UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]). The UNC -Chapel Hill  policy is 
based on this guidance. “Adverse events” that are not UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29725].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Differentiating between an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_238587], an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29727], whereas an “adverse event” may be anticipated or unanticipated. 
Additionally, an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_238588] —whether or not any actual harm occurred. 
In order to decide which events or circumstances constitute an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961], it is important to bear in mind the 
following:  
• Not all Adverse Events are UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]. Only a small subset of “adverse events” occurring in FDA -
regulated clinical trials and other types  of studies constitute UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865].  Many events that are 
required to be reported to the sponsor or federal agency are not UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865].  
• An UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29729]. It is possible for an event that does not involve actual 
physical, psychological, social, or economic harm to a research subject or another person 
nevertheless to constitute an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29730] . This is the case if the event 
places subjects or others at increased or different risk of harm, regardless of whether actual harm 
has occurred.  
 
Budesonide vs Fluticasone Protocol – TREET Trial   Page 12 
Version: March 14, [ADDRESS_289022] subjects or others at  risk of ha rm, but no harm occurs. For example, an 
investigator conducting behavioral research collects individually identifiable sensitive information about illicit 
drug use and other illegal behaviors by [CONTACT_29759]. The data are stored on a laptop 
computer without encryption, and the laptop computer is stolen from the investigator’s car. This is an 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29734] (a) unexpected (i.e., the investigators did not 
anticipate the theft); (b) related to participation i n the research; and (c) placed the subjects at a greater risk 
of psychological and social harm from the breach in confidentiality of the study data than was previously 
known or recognized.  
Other examples of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29735], even though they are not adverse events, 
include:  
• Publication in the literature, safety monitoring report (e.g., DSMB report), interim result, or other 
finding that indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio of the research;  
• Breach in confidential ity resulting from a disclosure of confidential information or from lost or stolen 
confidential information;  
• Unresolved complaint of a participant, family member or other individual;  
• Laboratory or medication errors that may involve potential risk to that i ndividual or others;  
• Change in FDA labeling because of adverse consequences or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, 
device, or biologic used in a research protocol;  
• Disqualification or suspension of investigators;  
• Accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that involves risks or has the 
potential to recur;  
• Deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard 
to a research participant  
• Any deviation from the IRB -approved protocol that increases  the risk or affects the participant’s 
rights, safety, or welfare.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  UNC IRB Reporting Timelines  
Reporting is required of all UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865], including those which may occur after the participant has completed 
or is withdrawn from the study, or following study clos ure. Reporting is completed via IRBIS, UNC’s online 
IRB information system.  
 
Events that meet the criteria for an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29736] (1) week  of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any other events that meet the criteria for a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29737] (2) weeks  
of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
 
If the report cannot be completed in its entirety within the required time period, a preliminary re port should 
be submitted. The report should be amended once the event is resolved and/or more information becomes 
available.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_289023]. Evan Dellon  is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the 
FDA.  These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The following 
describes the safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_238629] 
21CFR312.32:  
 
 Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
Budesonide vs Fluticasone Protocol – TREET Trial   Page 13 
Version: March 14, 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL  – unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
 Within 15 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the  study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life -threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit the 
criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deeme d 
reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, 
or carcinogenicity.  
 
Additional reporting requirements  
Sponsors are also required to identif y in IND safety reports all previous reports concerning similar adverse 
events and to analyze the significance of the current event in light of the previous reports.  
 
Reporting Process  
Adverse events requiring reporting to FDA per the above may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a 
narrative format. If supplied as a narrative format, the minimum information to be supplied is noted above 
at the beginning of section 8.3.

8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section  
10).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of adverse events.

The DSMB will meet via conference call at the beginning of the study, and then at 6 -month intervals until 
the study is complete.  The PI ([CONTACT_29778]) as well as the study biostatistician ([CONTACT_238634]) will participate 
in the open portion of the meetings.  If needed, the DSMB’s voting members may then choose to discuss 
Budesonide vs Fluticasone Protocol – TREET Trial   Page 14 
Version: March 14, [ADDRESS_289026] the desirability of continued treatment. At the conclusion of each meeting, the DSMB will 
recommend whether the trial be continued.  The specific information it will review in clude: current status of 
study enrollment; level of medication compliance; medication -related adverse events; endoscopy -related 
adverse event; and subject -reported events.  Unexpected serious adverse events will be reported to the 
DSMB between meetings as needed, as well as to the UNC IRB as noted above.  
 
[ADDRESS_289027] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to  use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect 
at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is al ive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  So urce data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records , recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_110799], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study will utilize electronic case report forms (eCRFs).  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  
All missing data must be explained  in the comments section of the eCRF.  The electronic data capture 
system (EDC) will maintain an audit trail.  
9.4 Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_289028].  These documents should be retained for a longer period 
if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the resp onsibility of the sponsor to 
inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

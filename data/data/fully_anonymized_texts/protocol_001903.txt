 Safety 
Objectives  To assess the safety and tolerability of opaganib administered orally at [ADDRESS_653540] 
during screening and at baseline (Day 1).  
Study Design 
and Description  This is a phase 2a, proof of concept , multi -center randomized double -blind , 
parallel arm,  placebo -controlled study . The study is planned be performed in US  
and in other countries , in approximately [ADDRESS_653541] of care, in a randomization ratio of 1:1.  Treatment 
assignments will remain blinded to the patient, investigator and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], as 
well as  the sponsor. As there is currently no consensus for a definitive treatment 
specifically targeti ng the SARS -CoV -2 virus causing COVID -19 (Wilson, 2020 ), 
standard of care will refer to regional, institutional or physician directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
that may be implemented during the COVID -19 pandemic.   
Study participants will receive either opaganib 2 x 250  mg capsules (500 mg) 
every [ADDRESS_653542] of care 
(pharmacological and/or supportive). Study drug will be administered every day 
for 14 days (Day 1 to Day 14) , unless the patient has been discharged from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l without requiring supplemental oxygen , in which case study drug will 
only be administered to Day 10.  
All participants will be followed up for [ADDRESS_653543] dose of study drug, 
which may occur at the end of the 2 -week double -blind treatment pha se or after 
premature study drug discontinuation, based upon patient or physician 
determination.  
Stratification  Patients will be stratified based on a  minimization  algorithm taking the following 
three parameters into account: age at screening, ≥70 years of age, (yes or no ); 
HbA1c at screening,  ≥6.5, (yes or no ); oxygen requirement at baseline, requiring 
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (e.g. via BIPAP, CPAP), (yes or no )

Sample Size 
Estimation  The sample size for this Proof of Concept study was not chosen for statistical 
consideration, as there are no formal statistical inferences planned . The  size of the 
study is judged adequate for the preliminary evaluation objectives.  
Statistical 
Methods  The primary efficacy objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of Opaganib 
on total supplemental oxygen requirement (area under the curve) using daily 
oxygen flow (L/min) measurements for 14 days (Day 1 to Day 14). The primary 
efficacy endpoint will calculate for each patient the area under the curve of the 
supplemental oxygen requirement through day 14, using the trapezoidal rule after 
subtracting the ba seline oxygen requirement at each day. Days where no 
supplementary oxygen was needed, will be recorded as 0. If several values of 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd  Protocol ABC -[ADDRESS_653559]  2020  
12 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPR IETARY INFORMATION  
 oxygen requirement (L/min) are recorded in a certain day, for the primary 
analysis the highest of these values will be taken. In the primary analysis, for 
patients who die before Day 14, or require intubation and mechanical ventilation, 
missing daily values will be assigned the maximal supplemental oxygen flow 
requirement of 8L/min. For patients discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_506566] 14, if no values are collected by [CONTACT_506573], the 
oxygen requirement (L/min) on the day of discharge will be assigned thereafter 
for each day to Day 14.  The primary analysis will be based on the modified 
Intent to treat population (mITT), which consist of all patients that were 
randomized and treated with at least one dose of study drug,  Descriptive statistics 
of the baseline -adjusted AUC will be presented by [CONTACT_506574] 95%

asymptomatic infection to pneumonia and Adult Respi[INVESTIGATOR_506567] (ARDS) with 
multiorgan failure, that may lead to death ( Zhou, 2020 ). In the Zhou study, the median duration of 
viral shedding was 20 days, with an interquartile range of 17 -24 days and a maximum of 37 days. 
Common symptoms reported in the Zh ou study for 191 patients were fever (94%), cough (79%), 
sputum production and fatigue (each 23%) and myalgia (15%).  Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were 
noted in 75% of patients on chest X -ray. Patients over [ADDRESS_653572] availability, utilizing Polymerase Chan Reaction ( PCR ) performed on nasopharyngeal 
swabs or other body fluids, has been limited.   
For most individuals testing positive, COVID -[ADDRESS_653573] ( van 
Doremalen, 2020 ) and potential fecal spread ( Chen , 2020 ).  As this is a newly identified disease, first 
noted in December 2019, and as testing and interpretation of data are in a very early stage, no specific

Opaganib [3 -(4-chlorophenyl) -adamantane -1-carboxylic acid (pyridin -4-ylmethyl)amide, 
hydrochloride salt] is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) (French, 
2010 ).  SK2 is an innovative molecular target due to its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, which 
is known to regulate many cellular functions, including the replication -transcription complex (RTC) of 
+single -strand RNA viruses (Reid, 2015).

properties. Using SK2−/− mice and differential gene expression analysis, it was demonstrated that 
SK2/ sphingosie -1-phosphate ( S1P) signaling could play a key r ole in promoting pneumonia via 
promoting inflammation and suppressing other factors that inhibit inflammation and host defense 
(Ebenezer, 2019).The results suggested that inhibition of SK2 may both inhibit viral replication and 
decrease pulmonary inflammat ion, ameliorating lung  injury. Additional evidence for the anti -

 inflammatory properties of opaganib is derived from murine  inflammatory bowl disease  (IBD) models 
of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and rodent models of inflammatory arthritis and liver ischemia 
reperfusion . Opaganib has been  shown to suppress anti -inflammatory responses in -vitro and in -vivo, 
including :  
1) decreased IL -6 levels, TLR4 express ion, NF -κB activation and TNF α-induced activation of 
NFκB pro -inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine (TNF α, IL-1β and CXCL -10) production 
(Liu, 2010, Maines , 2008, Maines , 2010)  
2) decreased infiltration of monocytes/ macrophages and neutrophils ( Liu , 2012)  
3) blocke d CD4+ T cell infiltration and IFN γ production (Liu, 2012)  
4) abrogation of TNF α-induced expression of adhesion proteins and blockade of TNF α-
induced PGE2 as a measure of COX -2 activity (Maines, 2008).  
Several other studies have reported that SK2 regulates cellular gene expression during Chikungunya 
virus (CHIKV) infection ( Reid, 2015 ) and can maintain viral latency for Kaposi’s sarcoma -associa ted 
herpesvirus (Dai, 2014). SK2 recruitment into the RTC has been demonstrated in CHIKV in the 
Togaviridae family of viruses which contains a non -segmented +single stranded RNA genome 
(COVID -19 is a +single stranded RNA genome). Treatment of infected HepG 2 cells with opaganib 
significantly reduced CHIKV infection ( Reid, 2015 ).  Targeted knockdown of SK2 also inhibited 
hepatitis c virus ( HCV ) replication (Yamane, 2014).  
Inhibition of SK2 with opaganib has also demonstrated a decrease in viral titers of inf luenza virus in 
an in vitro model system (with an EC50 well within the achievable concentrations of opaganib in 
humans, based on the phase 1 human trial) a s well as  improve d survival in a preclinical study of 
influenza infected mice receiving  opaganib dail y for two days (Xia , 2018).  
Opaganib has also demonstrated a remarkable inhibitory effect in a dose dependent manner in a 
preliminary Ebola cell -based inhibition assay  (RedHill  Biopharma,  unpublished data ). The dose s that 
displayed near complete inhibition of Ebola cellular infection are also achievable in humans .

one percent were male, 67% white . All patients had received prior chemotherapy and approximately 
half had prior surg ery and/or radiotherapy. Patients had a variety of concomitant medical conditions 
and were receiving a variety of medications in addition to their antitumor therapy.   
The administered oral dose of 500 mg Q12 hours was the maximum tolerated dose.  There were  no 
deaths reported during the administration of opaganib. There were no discontinuations due to adverse 
events (AEs), in 250 mg QD and 250 mg bid cohorts.  Common adverse events were nausea (12 
patients, 57%), fatigue (12 patients, 57%) , vomiting (8 patien ts, 38%)  and neuropsychiatric effects  (14 
patients, 67%) including anxiety, insomnia, agitation and dysarthria.  Of these, only fatigue appeared 
to be dose -related.   Nausea and vomiting were common but not dose -limiting and rarely required 
discontinuation of treatment. Neuropsychiatric effects were seen at all dose levels, though were more 
common and bothersome at the highest dose level, [ADDRESS_653579] increases or grade shifts in liver function tests, hematologic 
parameters, or other biochemical parameters except for creatinine and lymphocytes. No patient 
developed clinically significant ECG abnormalities on study. There were no treatment group 
differences noted for the c hanges from baseline of QTcF . For more detailed data refer to Investigator 
Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 1b Study in patients with advanced multiple myeloma  (Study No. ABC -

Thirteen  patients received  study  drug:  3 at 250 mg Q12 hours , 4 at 500 mg Q12 hours  and 6 at  750 mg 
Q12 hours .  Median age of patients was 69 years (range 57 -89), 7 were males, 7 were white and 6 
black.  All patients had received multiple courses of therapy with a median of 7 prior lines of treatment 
(range 3 -13) excluding stem cell transplantati on.  Eight patients had autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 1a Study  of food and administration route effect study in healthy 
volunteers (Study No, ABC -109) 
A total of 23 subjects participated in the study, 19 each received the drug orally in the fed and fasted 
states, and 21 via nasogastric ( NG) tube. Mean and median ages of the subjects were 48.2 and 50.0 
years, respectively (range 22 -72 years). Of the subjects, 56.5% were males, 78.3% were white, and 
47.8% were Hispanic. Median weight was 75.2 kg (range 52.0 -123.3).   
Subjects received  a single 500 mg  dose of opaganib (two 250 mg capsules) after a large standard meal , 
while fasting, and via nasogastric tube. Overall, 13 subjects (56.5%) experienced at least one 
treatment -emergent event (TEAE). Of these, 9/13 and 4/[ADDRESS_653581] common TEAEs were nausea (3 subjects, 13%), diarrhea (3 subjects, 13%), 
dizziness (5 subjects, 21.7%) and headache (5 subjects, 21.7%). The drug was better tolerated after 
food as compared to the fasting state , with d ouble the  proportion of subjects experienc ing TEAEs  after 
fasted administration of opaganib  compared to the  fed state.  
Administration with a large standard meal (fed state) resulted in prolongation of absorption, with an 
increase in time to maximum concen tration by [CONTACT_385642] a 43% decrease in peak plasma 
concentration. Overall bioavailability (AUC0 -inf) was reduced by 17%  compared to fasted state . The 
change in bioavailability did not appear to affect pharmacologic activity, as S1P suppression, a 
pharma cologic consequence of SK2 inhibition, was somewhat higher after administration of opaganib 
in the fed state.  
Administration of an opaganib suspension by [CONTACT_385643]. Hence, s ubjects/patients who are unable to swallow capsules may take 
the drug in suspension form and via NG tube.  For more detailed data refer to Investigator Brochure.

9.3 Women of Childbearing Potential  Definition  
For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP),  
i.e. fertile, following menarche, and until becoming post -menopausal, unless permanently  
sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], tubal ligation 
and bilateral oophorectomy.  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd  Protocol ABC -[ADDRESS_653592]  2020  
25 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPR IETARY INFORMATION  
 A postmenopausal state is defined as no m enses for 12 months without an alternative medical  
cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be  
used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or  
hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, multiple FSH 
measurement are required to confirm postmenopausal state.  
Highly effective contraceptive measures, with a failure rate of less than 1% per year, for WOCBP 
include:  
a. intrauterine device  
b. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained medical assessment of 
surgical success for the procedure)  
c. and/or sexual abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
d. If combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, 
transdermal) or progestogen -only hormon al contraception (oral, injectable, implantable), intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system associated with inhibition of ovulation is utilized then a secondary method 
of highly effective birth control is required, for example condom plus spermicide, or cervic al cap plus 
spermicide . 
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods.

 15 ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS  
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_506580] d States Code of Federal Regulations (21 
CFR 312.32(a)) and are included here.  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (may also be refe rred to as an adverse 
experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational or marketed) product, whe ther or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational or marketed) product and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, 
including an overdose.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resu lts in any of 
the following outcomes :   
• death;  
• is a life -threatening adverse event (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it wer e more severe);  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312];  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• is an important medical event.  This is defined as a medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may re quire medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.  
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blo od dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
If either the sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and be evaluated by [CONTACT_80220].  
A suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed  at the specificity or severity that has been observed.    
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any (suspected) adverse reaction (any 
adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event) that is 
both serious and unexpected.

this study to determine “suspected adverse reactions” that require expedited reported to re gulatory 
agencies if they are unexpected.  In addition to the assessment below, the aggregate number of 
occurrences will be considered to decide whether the event is a reportable event and requires an IND 
safety report.

 15.2 Adverse Event  Grading  
Adverse events will be graded according to the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(NCI -CTCAE version 5.0).   
If an AE is not listed in the NCI -CTCAE v.5.0, then the Physician will use the terms: mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threaten ing, or death to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these 
intensity grades are defined  as follows:  
Table 3.: Adverse Event Grade Definitions  
GRADE    
1 Mild  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL  
3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL  
4 
 Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
[ADDRESS_653618] be 
provided to the sponsor within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s initial notification/awareness of 
the event.  All telephone communication regarding SAE must be followed by a written report.  Duly 
authorized  study site p ersonnel may sign completed SAE report  forms; however, it is recommended 
that the investigator sign each final SAE report.  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Thus, follow -up 
information that becomes ava ilable as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], additional lab and test results, autopsy reports, etc.), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial report, and immediatel y sent to the CRO using 
the same procedure as the initial SAE report. Information on the SAE must be in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of causality.  
For ease of analysis, worldwide sta ndardization, and regulatory reporting, the sponsor will code each 
reported adverse event or symptom to its corresponding preferred term and body system/organ class in

As required, all investigators will be notified of all AE reports that are determined to be serious, 
unexpected, and related (by [CONTACT_344937] ) to the investigational product.  The 
notification will be in the form of a Safety Update (Dear [CONTACT_344952]).  
The notification is considered an addendum to the current Investigator’s Brochure; therefore, upon 
receiving such notices, the investigator must review and immediately submit a co py to the IRB  
according to local regulations.  The notification must be retained within the Investigator’s Brochur e.  
The investigator and IRB  will determine if the informed consent requires revision.  
15.4 Laboratory Abnormalities  
All new abnormal laboratory findin gs and those abnormal at baseline which change significantly (i.e., 
by [CONTACT_506582] [NCI CTCAE] v5.0 ) are considered AEs.  Laboratory AEs for which th ere 
is no clinical intervention will be recorded only on the laboratory data pages of the eCRF.  Laboratory 
AEs not listed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0  will be considered as grade 1 (mild) if there is no clinical 
effect or intervention.  Laboratory values outside the normal range for certain parameters will not be 
considered AEs if they are generally not considered as indicating an abnormality; this incl udes such 
parameters as liver enzymes which are below the normal range.  If there is a clinical sequela or 
intervention, the laboratory abnormality is to be graded according to the criteria used for clinical AEs, 
described above.

Ad hoc DSMB meetings will convene when clinically significant events  (adverse events of special 
interest Section 1 5.5.2), per physician discretion,  may indicate a potential increase in systemically 
important inflammation in any one patient in the study, based on an increase d and clinically significant 
oxygen requirement , or a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_385617].  
At each review/meeting the  DSMB will determine whether the s tudy should proceed as planned or 
should be terminated.   
No formal efficacy analysis will be performed at any DSMB review , as the sample size is not 
sufficient to determine  futility conclusions .

care (n=20). The sample size for this Proof of Concept s tudy was not chosen for statistical 
consideration, as there are no formal statistical inferences planned. The size of the study is judged 
adequate for the preliminary evaluation objectives.  
17.2 Stratification  
Patients will be stratified based on a minimization  algorithm taking the following three parameters into 
account: age at screening, ≥70 years of age, (yes or no); HbA1c at screening,  ≥6.5, (yes or no); 
oxygen requirement at baseline, requiring non -invasive positive pressure ventilation (e.g. via BIPAP, 
CPAP), (yes or no)  
17.[ADDRESS_653642] of Opaganib on total supplemental 
oxygen requirement (area under the curve) using daily oxygen flow (L/min) measurements for 14  days 
(Day 1 to Day 14). The primary efficacy endpoint will calculate for each patient the area under the 
curve of the supplemental oxygen requirement through day 14, using the trapezoidal rule after 
subtracting the baseline oxygen requirement at each day.  Days where no supplementary oxygen was 
needed, will be recorded as 0. If several values of oxygen requirement (L/min) are recorded in a 
certain day, for the primary analysis the highest of these values will be taken. In the primary analysis, 
for patients who die before Day 14, or require intubation and mechanical ventilation, missing values 
will be assigned the maximal supplemental oxygen flow requirement of 8L/min. For patients 
discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_506570] 14, if no values are collected by [CONTACT_506585], the oxygen requirement (L/min) on the day of discharge will be assigned thereafter for 
each day to Day 14.   
The primary analysis will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT), which consist of 
all patients that were randomized and treated with at least one dose of study drug,  
Descriptive statistics of the baseline -adjusted AUC will be presented by [CONTACT_506574] 95%

 analysis will assume that in case that all supplemental oxygen values are missing after treatment 
discontinuation, the individual AUC will be calculated  where the last value is carried forward - until 
Day 14, or death, if  occurred before. A sensitivity analysis to the above missing data handling

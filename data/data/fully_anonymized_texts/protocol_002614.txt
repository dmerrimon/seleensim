1.0       PURPOSE  
1.1 Name [CONTACT_538368].  
 
The intended use of the Elite iQ device used in this study is for the treatment of hair removal, 
pseudo folliculitis barbae, and benign  vascular and pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436]. 
 
1.2 Objectives   
1. Primary Objectives:  
 To assess the safety of the study devices through the collection of side effects 
throughout the study.  
 To assess efficacy by [CONTACT_538364]. 
2. Secondary Objectives: 
 To assess of efficacy of the study device through Investigator and subject 
questionnaires.  
 To assess the ease of use of the new device.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_701589]’s participation in this study may last up to [ADDRESS_701590] approximately  21 months.  
 
2.0 PROTOCOL 
2.1 Protocol Methodology and Analysis  
Methodology: 
Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are a healthy male or female 18 years of age 
or older. Up to 20  subjects will be enrolled at up to 1 study center. Subjects will attend a 
screening/pretreatment visit which may be performed on the same day as the treatment visit. 
Subjects may receive up to [ADDRESS_701591] or as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_538365]. 
  
Analysis: 
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in non-ablative aesthetic treatments and will 
drive demand for innovated products, procedures, and practice design.1 Due to this shift in patient 
base, practices need to evolve to adapt to the newer generational ideologies. This device uses the 
Alexandrite wavelength (755 nm) and the Nd:YAG wavelength (1064 nm) target hair follicles, 
unwanted veins, pi[INVESTIGATOR_538355]-damaged skin. Although this laser technology is 
one of the most used, there is a need for a new advanced treatment guidance system that is built 
into the laser.

Version 1.0: October 30, 2020  CONFIDENTIAL Page 8 of 30 
 
Relevance: 
According to the [ADDRESS_701592] 8 years.2 There is 
an increasing demand for new methods and novel laser technology for improved treatment 
outcomes. Other devices currently on the market cleared for use include, but are not limited to, the 
Excel and Candela devices. 
 
Testability: 
The Elite+ device, the most current approved Elite platform, had been previously cleared for use 
for hair reduction and the treatment of vascular lesions, benign pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436], pseudo 
folliculitis barbae, and wrinkles (FDA K141425). This study will utilize similar evaluation 
methods to assess prototype software and accessories.  
 
Compatibility: 
Although laser technology is a well-known and widely use technique for non-ablative aesthetic 
treatments, there is still a need to improve technology to reduce the number of treatments and 
provide a more effective treatment plan. 
 
Predictive power: 
Assuming there is significant improvement, it would be appropriate to expect results in different 
areas where other products and devices have significant results alongside more effective treatments 
for hair removal, pseudo folliculitis barbae, and benign vascular and pi[INVESTIGATOR_80436].

pus). 
o An antibiotic cream should be used if there is any blistering or break in the skin. 
o Do not use tanning beds. 
o Avoid hot baths/whirlpools for 1 week following treatment (vein treatment). 
o Normal skin care regimens, i.e., makeup, moisturizers, deodorant, and shaving may be 
resumed the day after treatment if there is no redness, blistering, or crusting present. If 
makeup is allowed, apply and remove it delicately. Excess rubbing can open the area 
and increase the chance of scarring. If the area blisters, extreme caution should be used 
when applying or removing makeup. The treated area is very delicate and should be 
treated with care. 
o For vein treatment, discomfort, such as swelling or redness (lasting from a few hours to 
a couple of days), can be relieved with acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ice packs. 
o Apply lotion to the area to prevent drying and crusting. Lotion applied following the 
laser treatment can have a soothing effect. If a crust develops, allow it to fall off 
naturally. Do not scratch or pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] (vein treatment).

Adverse Events Pertaining to the Elite iQ Device: 
 Subjects may experience some temporary erythema, edema, bruising, or irritation of the 
skin around the treatment site. 
 Scarring, though rare, can occur following any laser procedure. 
 Blistering during treatment may be an indication of sun exposure or an excessive fluence 
setting for the skin type. Blistering can occur during the first three days following the laser 
procedure.  
 Other acute changes may include scaling or scabbing. These changes are often associated 
with higher energies and their incidence decrease when treatment energies are reduced. 
 Histamine/Hives: some subjects may develop raised papules similar to hives. This irritation 
usually subsides in a few hours. 
 Pustules, pi[INVESTIGATOR_59423], or folliculitis may develop in the first few days following treatment.  
 Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_538359]. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_538360]. 
 Hemosiderin Staining- The treated vessel may leak tiny amounts blood into the tissue. 
When the red blood cells die, iron released from the hemoglobin is converted into 
hemosiderin and stored in the tissue beneath the skin. This shows up as a brown/purple 
stain on the skin. It usually will fade over time, but some may require further treatment to 
resolve. 
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Gel: 
The gel is a water-based gel that may be placed on the skin during the Elite iQ treatment. No known 
adverse events are documented. However, an allergic reaction is always possible when placing a 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_81864]. Allergic reaction may include a mild reaction such as skin redness, irritation 
or hives. 
  
 Adverse Events Pertaining to Anesthesia: 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459], such as but not limited to; EMLA, LMX and Lidocaine/Tetracaine, will be used. 
The most common side effects for most anesthetics include redness, blanching, swelling and 
application site reaction.   
 
Less common side effects include large swellings that look like hives on the skin or in the mouth or 
throat, pain, burning, paleness and altered temperature sensation. Subjects may be allergic to the 
contents of any anesthetic which may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms 
and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_538361].  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Marker: 
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness or a 
rash. 
 
Other Cautions: 
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment.

summary which will include the number and percent of patients for each outcome.  The statistical 
significance of the mean change from baseline for each treatment group will be determined using a 
student’s paired t-test.   
 
2.15.6 Analysis of Safety Variables 
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfort related to the procedure (universal 
pain scale) and the collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of the study.  For each 
treatment group these variables will be summarized.  The summaries will include the number and 
percent of patients for each outcome.  No statistical comparisons will be performed for any of 
these variables.

health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 
 
3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experience with the use of the system and/or similar systems and industry experience.  Experience 
with treatments is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial. 
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods may be used in 
conjunction with subjective evaluation methods when feasible.  The value of the compensation to 
the clinical investigator for conducting the study is not influenced by [CONTACT_81906].  If 
photographic results are listed as the primary objective, they are to be evaluated by [CONTACT_81907].  If information concerning investigator assessment of 
improvement or investigator satisfaction is collected, then it is not listed as an objective for the study.

Version 1.0: October 30, [ADDRESS_701614] an adverse 
reaction to the Elite iQ device use. There may be some side effects that we don’t know about yet. 
 
3.3 Risk Analysis 
 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
The Alexandrite wavelength (755 nm) and the Nd:YAG wavelength (1064 nm) target hair follicles, 
unwanted veins, pi[INVESTIGATOR_538355]-damaged skin.  The Elite iQ laser system delivers the 
correct combination of wavelengths (755 and 1064 nm), high fluences (up to 600 J/cm2) and long 
pulses (up to 300 ms) for its clinical applications. Further investigation of parameter optimization is 
necessary to achieve safe and efficacious results.    
 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
There is one risk identified with the Elite iQ device used in this study. The risk identified is the 
lack of clinical data using this software for evidence of effectiveness. Parameters need to be further 
investigated to be optimized for efficacious results.    
 
The risk identified with the overall clinical investigation is the integrity of the data collected. 
 
There are multiple clinical mitigation strategies for the risks identified. Proper training on the 
device and protocol will be performed. Data from prior investigations will be utilized to minimize 
side effects and optimize treatment outcomes. Monitoring of the study will be implemented to 
minimize subject and data risks.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:    
The subject may or may not have improvement for the indication treated. 
 
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION:  
Many physicians support the use of laser devices for non-invasive cosmetic treatments due to 
current patient satisfaction of cosmetic results with the currently available devices. However, there 
is still a level of interest in novel technologies that could reduce the need for future treatments with 
better treatment outcomes.  
 
ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY: 
There is uncertainty of the efficacy of the treatment with the use of the Elite iQ system.  
 
CONCLUSION: 
The Elite iQ device is determined to be a non-significant risk study and has been FDA cleared for use. 
This device poses similar risks to its predicate device, the Elite+, which is also currently FDA 
cleared for use.  The risks posed to the subjects and integrity of data are acceptable.

they may contact [CONTACT_305458]. 
The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review each event and assess its relationship to 
the study device (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the Elite iQ treatments:  
 Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product. 
 Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
 Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.

 Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11260]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81888], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a 
positive reaction at the application site. 
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3-point severity. Using the following 
definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday 
activities. 
 Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities. 
 Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life-threatening adverse device experience, in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81889], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse device experience 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by [CONTACT_58317] 
(CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported 
within [ADDRESS_701626] to follow-up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow-up.  Following the resolution of any study-

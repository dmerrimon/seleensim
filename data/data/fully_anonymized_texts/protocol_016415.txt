APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021Page 2 of 27An estimated 36% of youth are bullied (1). Youth with obesity are more likely to be bullied than healthy-
weight peers (2-4). Bullying is when a perpetrator with more power intentionally and repeatedly causes harm 
to a victim (1, 5). Bullying can be physical, verbal or relational (6) and is highly distressing (7, 8). Bullying is a 
significant pediatric public health problem: victims are more likely than non-bullied peers to have social and 
academic impairment (7, 9, 10), anxiety and depression (11, 12), eating disorders (13), weight gain (4), and 
poorer overall health (11, 14-16). Bullying is also associated with self-harm and suicide (11, 17, 18). Childhood 
bullying has long-term associations with adult health problems: anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide, 
poorer overall health, and poorer social functioning (11, 12, 16, 19).
Approximately 41% of girls and 28% of boys who experience bullying develop post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) (20). The nature of bullying (that it occurs as events, leaves children feeling unsafe , and engenders 
emotional distress) fits trauma treatment criteria (21). Some experts recommend trauma treatment for 
bullying (22-24), although this application is untested. 
Weight is the most common reason children are bullied (25). Weight-related bullying has consequences (7): 
binge eating 
(26), unhealthy weight-control behaviors (e.g., vomiting) (26), body image concerns (27), and 
obesity (16, 27). Bullied youth say they use binge eating and unhealthy weight-control behaviors to cope with 
distress (7) and avoid future victimization (28). 
Taken together, obesity and bullying appear to be 
bi-directionally associated: children with obesity are 
more likely to be bullied, and bullying has serious 
consequences including obesogenic eating-disorder 
behaviors and weight gain (4). Girls appear 
particularly vulnerable. Girls are more likely than 
boys to be bullied because of weight (26), more girls 
have clinical levels of trauma symptoms after 
bullying (20), and more girls than boys have long-term weight gain, weight/shape concerns, binge eating, and 
unhealthy weight-control behaviors (27) after weight-bullying. As obesity and eating disorder prevalence are 
both higher among girls (29, 30), and there are immediate and long-term associations of obesity with health 
problems (31-36), girls who are bullied because of weight are particularly vulnerable—because of their weight 
and bullying experiences—to health problems and impaired wellbeing. 
Treating bullying during childhood could reduce immediate and long-term health consequences. There are 
school-level prevention programs to reduce the occurrence of bullying and policy initiatives aimed at 
preventing bullying (37, 38), but there are no established individual-level treatments for weight-related 
bullying despi[INVESTIGATOR_742043]’s health (20, 39) and individuals’ beliefs 
that healthcare providers are important sources of help for youth who have been bullied (25). 
Youth who are bullied because of their weight need treatment for traumatic stress and potentially co-
occurring or developi[INVESTIGATOR_742044]-control behaviors, disordered eating, and obesity. 
To address this gap in child health research, the current study will develop cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for weight-related bullying. Trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) will be combined with CBT for eating disorders 
(CBT-ED). TF-CBT helps children regulate emotions surrounding a highly-distressing stressor and enhance 
safety to prevent further victimization (21, 40, 41).

Youth who are bullied because of their weight need treatment for traumatic stress and potentially co-
occurring or developi[INVESTIGATOR_742044]-control behaviors, disordered eating, and obesity. 
To address this gap in child health research, the current study will develop cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for weight-related bullying. 
Initial Efficacy Testing. This  study will combine existing evidence-based treatments for trauma (trauma-
focused cognitive-behavioral therapy;  TF-CBT) and eating disorders (cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating 
disorders; CBT-ED) into a new treatment for weight-related bullying using the Stage Model of Behavioral 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_46747] (42-44). The therapy manual, clinician training materials, and adherence/competence 
measures will be refined using feedback solicited from patients and clinicians at each treatment session (how 
helpful and relevant they found it, how much they liked it). Open-ended questions will explore preferences, 
feedback about material to add or remove, and perceived benefits and costs to treatment parameters.
Treatment will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] N=30 teens.  Research clinicians with doctoral training in psychology will 
administer CBT under the supervision of the PI.
Format and Content of Treatment. Treatment will be 12 sessions (3 months, weekly telehealth sessions). 
Participants will be video and/or audio-recorded if they consent to this procedure. Recordings will be for the 
purpose of evaluating treatment fidelity, as well as part of monitoring research-clinicians in the delivery of the 
treatment as specified in the protocol.  Drawing from TF-CBT with additional material from CBT-ED, CBT for 
weight-related bullying will have five stages: 1) Orienting to treatment and establishing a therapeutic 
foundation; 2) Copi[INVESTIGATOR_403733]; 3) Specific behavioral strategies and their 
implementation; 4) Developi[INVESTIGATOR_742045]; and 5) Relapse prevention planning to 
maintain health behaviors. 
Parents will attend sessions monthly, during which they will learn about bullying and healthy eating 
behaviors, identify 
parent and family factors that could inhibit change, and help the youth establish copi[INVESTIGATOR_742046]. Children will teach parents what they have learned to 
increase self-efficacy and positive communication. Other developmentally-tailored content includes using 
tangible therapeutic tools, setting communication strategies with parents, eliciting peer support and parent 
health-behavior support, and focusing on short- and long-term health goals.

Assessments. Parents and adolescents will be assessed. At the beginning of treatment, adolescents will 
undergo a clinical assessment to confirm eligibility and to inform the course of treatment. Batteries are 
guided by [CONTACT_742073] (45-49). As well as established measures, acceptability 
(sessions attended; retention; patient/clinician ratings of content), and adherence (e.g., homework 
completion, clinician recordings coded for reliability and adherence), will be assessed.  We will also gather 
clinical data on the patient’s medical history prior to enrollment in the treatment. 
Assessment Training: Independent outcomes assessors will receive training in diagnostic interviews from 
investigators following well-established protocols used in previous projects. Once interviewers are certified in 
the measures (MINI and EDE), they will receive ongoing supervision to ensure consistent use and prevent 
drift.

Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview (50) for adolescents (51), the questionnaire version (EDE-Q) (52), 
and Questionnaire for Eating and Weight Patterns (QEWP-5) (53, 54) will assess disordered eating thoughts 
and behaviors (including binge/LOC eating). The EDE/EDE-Q and QEWP show good concordance (55-57), 
reliability (intra-class correlation .95-.99) and validity (58, 59). 
MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Version 7.0 (MINI) (60) is a brief structured interview for Axis I 
psychiatric disorders, including PTSD and eating disorders. Validation and reliability studies have supported 
the MINI, including good convergence with SCID (60). The MINI requires much less time than the SCID and 
reduces participant burden while providing adequate psychiatric data to characterize patients and determine 
exclusion criteria. 
Children’s Impact of  Event Scale-13 (CRIES ) (61) assesses trauma symptoms with good reliability and validity 
(62, 63) and has been used in clinical trials (64).
Kirby [CONTACT_742074] (65) will measure reward-based decision making by [CONTACT_742075]; this is related to adult weight loss (46, 66) and youth binge eating (67). The 
Kirby [CONTACT_403780] 5-weeks (r=.71) and 1-year (r=.63) (65). 
EARLY is a 2-item questionnaire about self-weighing frequency and scale access (47, 68, 69).
Amsterdam Executive Function Inventory  (AEFI) is a brief questionnaire assessing executive functioning ability, 
such as attention, self-control, and self-monitoring. The construct validity and reliability are considered 
adequate (70).
Sensitivity to Punishment/Sensitivity  to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ) (71) assesses reinforcement sensitivity, 
has been validated with people with eating disorders, and has a reliability of .75-.83.
Self-Compassion Scale
 (SCS) (72)is a widely used measure of self-compassion and is reliable (α=.77-.78)
Perceptions of Teasing Scale (POTS) (73) is an assessment of whether an individual has been teased and how 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021Page 6 of 27teasing affected them. Reliability for the subscales ranges .66-.90.
Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) (74) is a 6-item measure of resilience with good reliability (α=.80-.91). 
Weight Bias Internalization Scale-Modified (WBIS) (75) is an 11-item measure of weight-based self-stigma for 
children and adults across the weight spectrum. It is reliable (α=.90), has strong construct validity, and relates 
to eating pathology, body image, and self-esteem.
Weight-related Victimization is an unpublished measure developed by [CONTACT_403781] (which 
specializes in weight-related discrimination and stigma). These items examine different negative experiences 
related to weight for school-aged youth. It also examines how the weight-related victimization affects the 
child.
Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C) (76) is a 21 item measure of children’s self-efficacy in social, 
academic, and emotional areas; only the social and emotional subscales will be included, which have good 
reliability (α= .85 to .88).
CHAOS Scale (77) measures environmental processes within familial households, including perceive chaos, 
hubbub, and order. CHAOS has a reliable total score (α=.79) and a 12-month test-retest stability (r=.74).
General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) (78) is a 10-item measure of self-efficacy beliefs, such as copi[INVESTIGATOR_742047], for adults. The measure has adequate reliability (α=.76 to .90)
Fat Talk Questionnaire (FTQ) (79) is a measure of negative discussions about weight that the parent engages 
in; there are three subscales including fat talk about themselves (self), their child (child) or people with 
obesity (obesity). 
The measure has excellent reliability (α=.93).
Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form  (SF12) (80) is a widely-used measure of general health with well-
established reliability and  validity for physical- and mental-health quality of life (81, 82).
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is  a widely-used, brief measure of depression (83) developed with 
6000 adults, validated with 2291 adolescents, showing good sensitivity and specificity (84). 
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is used extensively and is a reliable (α=.88) measure of global self-esteem 
(85, 86) and has been used in work with adolescents and research on childhood obesity (87). 
Child Feeding
 Questionnaire (CFQ)  (88) will assess parent feeding practices (Restriction, Pressure to Eat, 
Monitoring) and attitudes (Perceived Responsibility, Concerns about Child Weight). The CFQ is reliable (α=.65-
.91) and valid for work with diverse parents (89) seeking weight loss treatment for their children (90). 
Perceived Stress Scale  (PSS) (91) is a widely used measure that examines how individuals perceive their lives 
as unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded. The PSS has a reliable total score (α=.83), 6-week temporal 
stability (r=.81) and validity associated with health behaviors including eating (92). It has also been validated 
in an adolescent sample (93, 94), with adequate convergent validity for stressful life events and internal 
consistency (α=.79).
Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA ) (95,  96) is used to assess clinical psychosocial impairment related to 
eating disorder pathology.  It has good construct and criterion validity, and strong internal consistency (α=.93), 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021

Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Columbia) (101) is a semi-structured assessment intended for 
administration by [CONTACT_722941]. It explores suicidal ideation and 
intensity, as well as behaviors and lethality. This measure will alert clinicians to safety concerns. See section 
on minimizing risks for the plan to manage any suicidality.
Anthropometric measures: Height will be reported to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_1014426] 0.1 pound using a digital scale. Height/weight data will calculate BMI (49). 
Adolescent BMI 
data will use CDC growth charts (age/sex-normed) to calculate BMI percentile, BMI z-score, 
and expected change in BMI (102). 
Ratings of Session Content. Patients and parents will be asked open-ended questions about the treatment 
(examples listed below).  Patients and parents will also rate session content on likert scales.

will eligibility be determined, and by [CONTACT_20898]? Write here
Participants will be interviewed during an initial intake by a study clinician. The structured Mini International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used to assess psychiatric disorders and psychopathology. The MINI 
along with the Eating Disorder Examination will also determine whether participants have any co-existing 
psychiatric conditions that require referrals, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136293]/different treatment. Data from 
the CRIES will be used to determine whether the adolescent is experiencing distress related to bullying 
(responding “sometimes” or “often” to items about the trauma), in conjunction with clinical assessment. 
Final determination of eligibility will be from the PI. Monitoring will occur at treatment visits and referrals will 
be provided if warranted. If a study participant experiences any psychiatric symptoms or distress (e.g., 
depressive symptoms or suicidality) at any stage of study participation he/she will receive short-term 
treatment and support from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403742] (which includes psychologists) and will be 
connected with a local emergency department (e.g., the Crisis Intervention Unit at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
and their pediatrician or a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136313].

experiences of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_742051]. Careful 
efforts aimed at maintaining confidentiality will be made (as described below). 
There is a chance that participants’ mood or eating concerns may fail to improve or may worsen during the 
study. Participants 
will be provided with short-term treatment and support from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9112] 
(which includes psychologists) and/or the participant will be withdrawn from the study if their clinical 
condition deteriorates to a significant degree. Any participant who is withdrawn will be provided with 
appropriate referrals.
11.Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
The study clinicians will be carefully trained and supervised by [CONTACT_978]. All study clinicians and study staff will 
have IRB 
and ethics training; because of their educational experience and training (e.g., in psychology), they 
can reasonably be expected to identify potential problems and to take appropriate action as medically 
indicated. 
Changes in suicidal thoughts will be assessed at each assessment visit using a structured interview (the 
Columbia) and 
as-needed according to clinicians’ judgment. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_742052]. 
The detailed assessments repeated during the course of treatment will allow for additional and ample 
opportunity to identify difficulties. In the event that a participant experiences undue distress, the team will 
provide referrals. 
Because treatment will be delivered via telehealth and may include participants who are not local, we will talk 
with the parent and child at the first appointment about what we will do if the teen reports thoughts of 
suicide. This will include telling the parent (either the parent in the study or another trusted adult caregiver) 
or recommending that the teen go to the emergency department, or telling the police that there is an 
emergency if the parent cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. We will also identify the local emergency department and 
contact [CONTACT_742076]’s pediatrician and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (if applicable) so that all the information is in one 
place. We will also work with the teen to come up with a more detailed plan if passive or active suicidality is 
reported (e.g., pleasurable distracting activities, trusted friends and family, reasons for living, active copi[INVESTIGATOR_25146]).

Subject accrual reviews will help to assure that subjects are being enrolled (accrued) at a rate necessary to 
meet the recruitment goals in general and with regard to racial/ethnic diversity. Subject accrual rates will be 
discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_742057]. 
Treatment Completion Rates 
Retention, attrition and completion rates will be carefully tracked and reviewed. This will be done quarterly to 
highlight any possible concerns and will be reviewed formally with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_742058]. 
Differential dropout across treatments and/or higher than expected dropout will be reviewed to determine 
whether any problems are present and what, if any, corrective action needs to be taken. “Trigger points” for 
corrective action, as described below, include: 35% (“low alert”), 40% (“mid alert”), 45% (“high alert”), and 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021Page 12 of 2750% (“extreme alert”). With early alerts to problems, action would be taken to avoid higher level alerts; if a 
higher-level alert should arise, more drastic actions would be taken.
It is possible that baseline differences between the treatment conditions, excessive attrition, and/or missing 
data will 
limit the value of the data analysis, and hence knowledge to be gained from this study. For these 
reasons, interim analyses will be conducted twice yearly. Baseline differences, if present, will be considered in 
relation to potential effects on the power to detect differences in the primary outcomes. If these effects were 
to develop and be sizeable, alterations to the randomization schedule would be considered. Such effects 
would be evaluated and discussed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_742059], and plans would be communicated to the Yale IRB. 
To address excessive attrition and missing data, the following actions would be taken at the “trigger point” for 
each level of alert: 
1) Low-level alert (35%): Review of potential problems by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_742060]. 
2) Mid-level alert (40%): Meeting between PI [INVESTIGATOR_742061]. 
3)
High-level alert (45%): Meeting between PI, safety monitor, and senior study team members to 
determine further alterations to study protocol to complete the study with no further losses. 
4) Extreme-level alert  (50%): In the unlikely event that a 50% dropout rate occurs prior to the mid-study 
time point, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_742062]. 
It is possible that other situations could occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. Any concerns would be 
discussed with
 appropriate parties (PI, Mentors, Safety Monitor, Yale IRB).
Measurement and Reporting of Adverse Events
Data on adverse events will be collected on an ongoing basis. Adverse events data will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_742063] (see Table above). 
This protocol presents minimal risks to the subjects and Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or 
Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]), including adverse events, are not anticipated. In the unlikely event that such problems 
occur, Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening and unanticipated (or 
anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and possibly, probably, or definitely 
related) or UPI[INVESTIGATOR_324039] a temporary or permanent interruption of study activities will be 
reported immediately (if possible), followed by a written report within [ADDRESS_1014432] through regular study meetings, and via email as they are 
reviewed by [CONTACT_978].
Attribution of Adverse Events: 
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_85048]:
a) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
b) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
c) Possible: Adverse event may be related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
d) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
e) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to the study treatment or assessment procedure.
Plan for Grading Adverse Events: 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021Page 13 of 27The following scale will be used to grade the severity of adverse events (should they occur) during the study:
a) Mild adverse event
b) Moderate adverse  event
c) Severe adverse event
Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
In addition to grading adverse events, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_170560] 
a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event will be considered serious if it results in any of the following 
outcomes:
a) Death;
b) A life-threatening experience that results in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
c) A 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
d) A 
congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
e) Any 
other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
Plan for reporting events to the Yale IRB that are unexpected AND related AND involve risk of harm to 
subjects or others:
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_403758], experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1) Is 
unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol and 
informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and
2) Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the  incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and
3) Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-medical in 
nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse events.
All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting requirements described above will be 
reported to
 the IRB in summary form at the time of continuing review. If appropriate, such summary may be a 
simple brief statement that events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as 
previously documented. 
Plan for reporting adverse events to the PI, Safety Monitor, and study team: 
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified:
PI
All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol; and
Yale IRB
The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_403759]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_742064].
Procedures for providing  follow up care:
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021Page 14 of 27Study participant safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_403786] [INVESTIGATOR_742065]/or requested. If a study participant 
experiences any psychiatric symptoms or distress (e.g., depressive symptoms or suicidality) at any stage of 
study participation he/she will receive short-term treatment and support from the study treatment team 
(which includes psychologists) and will be connected to a local emergency department (e.g., the Crisis 
Intervention Unit at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and her pediatrician or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136313].
Other Potential Issues Relating to Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_742066]: 
1) New Information: It is unlikely that any new information would become available during this trial that 
would necessitate stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. If new data become available, these will be evaluated. 
2) Limits of Assumptions: It is possible that baseline differences between the treatment conditions, 
excessive attrition, and/or  missing data could limit the value of data analysis. Baseline differences 
across treatment groups, if present, will be evaluated twice yearly and considered in relation to 
potential effects on the power to detect differences in the primary outcomes. If these effects were to 
develop and be sizeable, alterations to the randomization schedule would be considered. 
Limits of Rules: There are other situations that could occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136318]/or 
including a section on the safety report entitled “Other situations that have occurred since the last safety report 
that warrant
 discussion” to allow for communication of concerns.
13.Statistical Considerations:  Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design. 
Continuous variables will be examined for normality using probability plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. If 
normality is not satisfied and transformations do not achieve acceptable normality, nonparametric strategies 
will be considered. Analyses will be intent-to-treat. Outcomes will be tested at the α=0.[ADDRESS_1014433] sizes that will 
allow outcome 
variables to be selected and sample size to be calculated for a fully-powered randomized 
controlled trial that includes a control group. Descriptive statistics will characterize putative outcome 
variables (Aim 1: general health, trauma symptoms, weight/shape concerns) and variability, including 
confidence intervals. Exploratory analyses will identify potential outcome, predictor, and moderator variables 
to be tested in an adequately-powered RCT comparing CBT for weight-related bullying with a control group in 
preventing disordered eating and weight gain.
Variables and Analyses  for Primary Aims . (1) Establish feasibility: descriptive statistics will quantify total/last 
sessions attended, and clinician adherence (ratings of recorded sessions). (2) Acceptability: descriptive 
statistics will quantify treatment ratings (clinician/patient). (3) Test initial efficacy at post relative to baseline 
on clinical outcomes: descriptive statistics (means and variability, including confidence intervals) will 
characterize change and paired t-tests will test changes from baseline to post in (a) improvements in general 
health (SF12), (b) reductions in traumatic symptoms (CRIES) and (c) reductions in weight/shape concerns 
(EDEQ).  Repeated-measures growth mixture models (103) will explore response over time for these three 
variables (SF12, CRIES, EDEQ). This approach allows for different numbers of observations per participant, 
uses all available data on each participant, accounts for clustered data observations (e.g., parent-child), and is 
unaffected by [CONTACT_403787]. Because we cannot a priori  predict the shape of the response over 
time, we will first treat time as categorical and then test for polynomial trends. Attendance will be examined 
for informative dropout patterns.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/25/2021Page 15 of 27Variables and Analyses  for Secondary Aims: Explore whether clinical features improve with treatment: 
descriptive statistics (means and variability, including confidence intervals) will characterize change and 
paired t-tests will test changes from baseline to post in (1) eating disorder behaviors (epi[INVESTIGATOR_17771]), (2) 
depression (PHQ), (3) weight (BMI-z). As with primary aims, repeated-measures growth mixture models will 
explore response over time for these variables. 
 
Power Analysis and Justification of Sample Size for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]. Power estimates for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_742067]-ED for adolescents (104). Assuming a two-sided test at α=0.[ADDRESS_1014434] 80% power to detect clinically-meaningful within-subject effects (d=0.64) with a sample 
size of 23. With a sample size of 30, we have 80% power to detect clinically-meaningful effects if there is 20% 
dropout. Thus, we have a reasonable chance of finding statistically significant change, even in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

4. What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of  the identifiable 
study data 
and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
To ensure confidentiality, all research records will be kept on Yale secure servers and in locked files in the 
Department of 
Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. All research personnel will be trained and supervised 
around confidentiality issues. The training will include formal NIH or Yale IRB modules with testing 
certification as well as HIPAA guidelines to follow around confidentiality. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_742069]. All essential personnel will be included as research staff on the HIC 
protocol submitted for approval.
All participants will be assigned a study number. Subsequently, participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_742081] (e.g., John Smith [adolescent] = JSMI-A). A list of numbers and 
the corresponding names will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_742070] a Yale secure serve and/or in a locked 
research file. Any information published as a result of the study will be such that it will not permit 
identification of any participant. 
Individually identifiable health information will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. All information collected will remain confidential except when we 
are legally required to disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a 
child or elderly person, threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property. Research records 
may be audited by a regulatory agency within the federal government. Organizations that have a 
responsibility for protecting human subjects, including the Yale IRB (Human Investigation Committee), may 
have access to the research records.
All portable devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a 
device cannot
 be encrypted please submit an exception request to the Information Security, Policy and Compliance 
Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]
5. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If 
yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured. 
Data will be stored in locked cabinets for 7 years after the final data are collected. At the end of the study, 
participants will 
only be identified by [CONTACT_742082]. 
6. If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained?

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify  any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
The study may have no direct benefit to the participant.  The treatment is known to be helpful to youth with 
distress associated 
with other forms of trauma, but we do not know if it will be help adolescents who have 
experienced weight-related bullying. We anticipate that some of the knowledge from this study will be used 
to improve treatments for adolescents and to increase our understanding of treatments for weight-related 
bullying.
         SECTION  VI: R ESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
Alternatives include community referrals for weight loss counseling, cognitive behavioral therapy and 
interpersonal psychotherapy for eating disorders. These treatments do not generally address bullying. 
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
Parents and children will be paid for completing assessments (Mo.1=$20/each; Mo.2=$20/each; 
Post=$40/child, $20/parent). 
3.Costs
 for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects. 
The treatment will be provided at no cost to the participants. 
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research 
that presents the potential for physical harm (e.g., research involving blood draws).
This treatment is considered to be minimal risk and does not involve the potential for physical harm. Referrals 
will be provided if indicated.

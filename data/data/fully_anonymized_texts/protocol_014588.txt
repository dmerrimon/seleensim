1 Background Information 
N
ucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have become the gold standard for diagnosing 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia t rachomatis  (CT) infections in the uro genital 
tract but are not currently approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for use in 
extragenital sites, including the pharynx and the rectum.  
T
he goal of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the following [ADDRESS_1170924] from the pharynx and the rectum:   
•Company 1 Assay [C ompany 1 ] 1
•Company 2 Assay [Company 2 ] 2
•Company 3 Assay [Company 3] [ADDRESS_1170925] qualitative detection of Chlamydia 
trachomatis and/or  Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal or pharyngeal clinician -collected 
swabs from symptomatic or asymptomatic male or female patients . 
1.
[ADDRESS_1170926]  are a major public health threat. The World Health 
Organization (WHO)  estimated more than [ADDRESS_1170927] and NG  infections are asymptomatic, but infection can lead 
to serious sequelae, including infertility, chronic pelvic pain,  adverse obstetrical 
outcomes,  increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) acquisition, and 
disseminated infection .6-9 In addition to threats to individual health, there has been 
growing concern over antibiotic  resistance, and in 2013, the US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) classified drug- resistant NG as one of the three urgent -
level resistant bacteria.  Improved detection of extragenital NG is thought to be a crucial 
component of adequate treatment and thus prevention of further resistance.[ADDRESS_1170928]  infection is estimated to be between 90 -100% .[ADDRESS_1170929] characteristics of NAAT tests in comparison to culture and to additional NAAT platforms  (see Table  1). For diagnosis of CT, reported sensitivities are 80- 100% 
(pharyngeal) and 46- 100% (rectal), with s ignificant variation by [CONTACT_842532].
13-19 
Reported specificities are >99% for pharyngeal site and 89- 100% for the rectum. For 
diagnosis of NG, reported sensitivities are 72- 100% (phary ngeal) and 75- 100% (rectal), 
again with variation by [CONTACT_52804] .13,14,16-18 ,20,21 Reported specif icities are 72 -100% 
(pharyngeal) and 95- 100% (rectal).

*Sensitivity and specificity as reported by [CONTACT_120667] , each using unique definitions for the reference standard. As
discussed below, we will be using positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for
these calculations.
Despi
[INVESTIGATOR_842525], at this time,  there are no FDA -cleared commercial 
NAAT tests  for the detection of pharyngeal and rectal NG or CT infection.  The FDA -
clearance of such assays would increase the availability  and uptake and subsequently  
lead to improved screening and enhanced control of  NG and CT  extragenital  infections.   
The current proposed study will help provide the data required for FDA consideration to 
clear such assays for marketing.  
Becaus
e of the multi -site nature of the ARLG, its strong laboratory network and inclusion 
of investigators with expertise in NG and CT  detection and treatment, the ARLG is well-
positioned to conduct such a study.  C urrent commercial assays are “dual” assays and 
include targets for both NG and CT, so the goal of this study will be to evaluate the 
diagnostic accuracy for detection of both organisms at extragenital sites.    
The m
olecular targets of the three NAAT platforms that will be tested differ, which will 
allow for comparative evaluation.25

 results (see Section 3.5). This test utilizes [redacted] to identify the presence 
of
 the organism of interest in the clinical sample. [redacted]. Though the diagnostic 
ac
curacy of these assays for extragenital infections  has not previously been evaluated, 
studies evaluating the performance of these assays for confirmation of other NAATs 
suggest excellent concordance.28-31 
2.0 Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
For eac
h NAAT , estimate the PPAs  and NPAs  for detecting:  
•Neis
seria gonorrhoeae in rectal swabs
•Neisseria gonorrhoeae in pharyngeal swabs
•Chlamydia trachomatis  in rectal swabs
•Chlamydia trachomatis  in pharyngeal swabs
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
2.2.1  G
lobal analyses: 
For eac
h NAAT, positive predictive values  (PPVs) , negative predictive values  (NPVs), 
positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios, and sensitivity analyses will be 
calculated for detecting:  
•Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal swabs
•Neisseria gonorrhoeae in pharyngeal swabs
•Chlamydia trachomatis  in rectal sw abs
•Chlamydia trachomatis  in pharyngeal swabs

2.3 Outcome Measures  
The anatom
ic site infected status (ASIS) will be determined for each anatomic site 
(pharyngeal and rectal) and each organism (NG and CT), as shown below  in Table 2. 
pNAAT           Version 4.0  
     December 4th, 2017  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
12 P
ossible ASIS outcomes are: 
•Infected
•Not infected
•Indeterminate
•Invalid, exclude from analysis
The anatomic s ite is c onsidered to be infected i f both of t he reference test r esults are 
positive. T he anatomic s ite is c onsidered to be not i nfect ed when both reference test 
results ar e negative. I f there is d iscordanc e between t he reference tests, an add itional 
NAAT w ill be don e as a tie breaker. I n this c ase, agr eement of 2/ [ADDRESS_1170932] w ill be run b y the lab if an y NAAT 
is not concordant with the others and interpreted only in the case of discordant results 
between the two planned reference tests for each assay.  [redacted]. 
To determine the ASIS, the test result for each respective site (pharyngeal or rectal) and 
each organism (NG or CT) for each NAAT platform will be us ed.  Possible outcomes for 
each ass ay are:  
•Company 1 Assay (Company 1)1: Not detected, detec ted, invalid (sample  
processing control or sample adequacy control failed), error (probe check control  
failed), or no result (insufficient data was collected, e.g. test aborted). Initial invalid,  
error, or no result tests will be repeated. If the repeat tes t returns invalid, error, or no  
result, the final result will be considered an inv alid and will be categorized as  no result 
(NR) for the ASIS determination and statistical analyses  below. If the repeat test 
returns  not detected (negative) or detected (positive),  this will be the result used for 
the ASIS determination and statistical analyses.
•Company 2 Assay (Company 2)2: Negative, positive, equivocal (result between 
positive and negative), invalid (run status  is FAIL or other technical failure),  or error 
(sample was not tested due to an error detec ted by [CONTACT_113468]). Initial equivocal, 
invalid, and error test results will be repeated. If the repeat test result returns 
equivocal, the final test result will be considered an equivoc al test result for the ASIS 
determination and statistical analyses below. If the repeat test result returns invalid or 
error, the final test result will be c ategorized as equivocal if the initial test was 
equivocal and as no result (NR) if the initial test was invalid or error for the ASIS 
determination and statistical analyses below. If the repeat test returns negative or 
positive, this will be the result considered for the ASIS determination and statistical 
analyses.
•Company 3 Assay (Company 3 )3: For NG, possible results are positive
(detected, with cycle number less than or equal to the assay cut-o ff), negative ( no 
evidence of amplification or cycle number greater than the assay cut-o ff), and error.  
An equivocal interpretation does not apply. For CT, possible res ults are positive
(detected, with cycle number less than or equal to the assay cut-o ff), negative (no  
evidence of amplification), equivocal (c ycle number beyond the assay cut-o ff), and  
error. A sample with initial interpretation of error (both CT and NG) or eq uivocal (C T 
only) will be retested. If the repeat tes t returns negative or positive, this will be the  
result considered for the ASIS determination and statistical analyses. If the repeat
pNAAT           Version 4.[ADDRESS_1170933] result is equivocal  (CT only), the final test result will be considered equivocal for 
the ASIS determination and statistical analyses  below.  If the repeat test result is 
error, the final test result will be categorized as no result  (NR) for the ASIS 
determination and statistical analyses below  if the initial test result was error and as 
equivocal  if the initial test result was equivocal (CT only) .  
•Tiebreaker assay: Tiebreaker Assay (Company 4):  Negative, positive, equiv ocal 
(result between negative and positive ranges), invalid (run status is FAIL or other 
technical failure),  or error (s ample was not tested due to an error detected by [CONTACT_466582]). Initial equivocal, invalid and error test res ults will be repeated. If the  
repeated test result is equivocal, it will be considered an equiv ocal test result for the  
ASIS determination and statistical analyses below. If the repeat test result returns  
invalid or error, the final test result will be categorized as equivocal if the initial test  
was equivocal and as no result (NR) if the initial test was invalid or error for the ASIS  
determination and statistic al analyses below. If the repeat test returns negative or  
positive, this will be the res ult considered for the ASIS determination and statis tical 
analy ses.

at risk for such infections.  Each person will undergo screening for eligibility and, if 
eligible, will be approached for oral informed consent .   
4.3 Enrollment 
Once enrolled,  eight swabs will be taken:  four swabs will be taken from the pharyn x and 
four swabs will be taken from the rect um in addition to any swabs taken as part of routine 
clinical care. The swabs collected for routine clinical care will be taken first. The order of 
the research swabs will be randomized per subject to account for the possibility that  the 
yield of the swab is affected by [CONTACT_842535]. The swabs will 
be stored and transported per manufacturer guidelines. Results of th ose NAATs will not  
be reported back to the treating clinician for clinical purposes.   
Dat
a collection will include , but is not limited to,  assessment of signs and symptoms of 
rectal and/or pharyngeal  infection, as well as socio- demographic information such as age 
(not date of birth) , race, ethnicity and gender , and swab collection completeness .   
4.[ADDRESS_1170940] to agree to both pharyngeal 
and rectal swabs, if only one anatomic site is swabbed after enrollment for whatever 
reason, and all four swabs are completed for that anatomic site, those swabs fo r that 
anatomic site will be included in the analysis. If fewer than four swabs at a site are 
completed, that anatomic site (and swab results)  will be excluded from the analysis.

and running of the NAAT s for th e study. Each clinical study site will be assigned 
to send swabs to one of the two laboratories. Swabs will be processed and run at 
the reference testing laborator ies according to each manufacturer’s Instructions 
for Use (IFU). Initial equivocal , invalid, or otherwise undetermined results will be 
repeated per manufacturer’s guidelines before determining whether the result will 
be classified as positive, negative, equivocal, or no result . One of the reference 
testing laboratories will be responsible for running all of the tiebreaker assays, regardless of  the location of original study site.

collected and tested as a tiebreaker, if needed. [redacted] Diagnos tic accuracy will be 
calculated with respect to an anatomic site infected status  (ASIS) referenc e standard 
described in Section 3.5. As the reference standard is imperfect, we will report positive 
percent agreement and negative percent agreement in place of s ensitivity and specificity. 
One potential limitation of this study is that all three of the tests in the referenc e standard 
are N AATs. However, all three tests [redacted]. So while, theoretic ally, there may be 
correlation in the errors  produced by [CONTACT_842536], the v aried molecular targets and the 
different methods of capture, amplification and detection should mitigate this conc ern.

which will not be reviewed while the study is ongoing,  but may  be adjusted based only on 
the infection rates to ensure enough infected participants to estimate PPAs with desired 
precision. If infection is more prevalent than expected, a smaller sample size may be 
accepted. If however  infection is rare r than anticipated, then increases to sample size will 
be considered. The infection rate will be evaluated approximately every [ADDRESS_1170951], PPA  and NPA will be estimated using 95%

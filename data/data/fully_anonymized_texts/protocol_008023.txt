Title of Study: 
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
IDP-124 Lotion for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis in Pediatric and Adult Subjects 
Number of Clinical Centers: 
Approximately 20 investigational centers in North America and Latin America 
Objectives:  
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IDP-124 Lotion for the 
treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in pediatric and adult subjects, 2 years of age and 
older.  
Methodology: 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate treatment 
success using a 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale from clear to severe; the improvement of  
Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI); improvement in total affected body surface area (TBSA); assessment of 
pruritus (itching) and sleep disturbance; Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) from subjects and 
parents/legal guardians of pediatric subjects; and investigator’s assessment of signs and symptoms of AD. 
The study consists of a 6-week double-blind treatment period and 4-week post-treatment follow-up. Study 
visits include Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 (subjects will return to the clinic at Week [ADDRESS_236464]-treatment follow-up visit). At the Screening Visit, subjects or their parents/legal guardians (when 
applicable) will sign an informed consent/assent form, provide their medical histories, report their previous 
and concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and be evaluated against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. For all pre-
menses females (9 and older) and females of childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed at specified visits. An abbreviated physical exam will be performed, vital signs measured (sitting 
blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and temperature), and blood and urine specimens will be collected for serum 
chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis evaluations (and serum pregnancy for all pre-menses females [9 and 
older] and females of childbearing potential). During this visit, the investigator will perform the IGA, evaluate 
the subject for TBSA affected by [CONTACT_22802], and assess the subject for other signs and symptoms of AD. 
At the Baseline Visit, prior to being evaluated by [CONTACT_110219], subjects or parents/legal 
guardians (if applicable) are to complete the POEM. At this visit, medical histories and concomitant 
medication /therapy use will be updated, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be confirmed. Adverse 
events since the Screening Visit will be assessed, and all pre-menses females (9 and older) and FOCBP will 
have urine pregnancy tests performed. During the Baseline Visit, the IGA, EASI, Pruritus and Sleep 
Disturbances assessment, and Subject Assessment scale will be completed, and the investigator will evaluate 
the subject for other signs and symptoms of AD.

 After confirming eligibility at the Baseline Visit, subjects will be randomized using the interactive response 
technology (IRT) in a 2:1 ratio to receive either IDP-124 Lotion or IDP-124 Vehicle Lotion. Randomized 
Subjects or parents/legal guardians of pediatric subjects will apply the first administration of the assigned 
study drug to the affected areas of the skin (as identified in a body diagram in the source documentation) at the 
investigational center under the supervision of designated study personnel. Subjects will receive the study drug 
and given verbal and written instructions for treatment application. Specifically, the subjects will be instructed 
to apply the lotion to the affected areas twice daily, at approximately the same time each day, [ADDRESS_236465] of all applications and to note any 
missed applications of the study drug. In addition, at selected sites, standardized photography will be 
performed at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 10.  
Throughout the study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_119083] (AEs), assessing 
vital sign measurements and abbreviated physical examination findings, and noting any additions or changes 
in concomitant medication uses. Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening and Week 6 visits for 
routine safety laboratory evaluations (and serum pregnancy for pre-menses females [9 and older] and 
FOCBP); and urine pregnancy tests will be obtained for all pre-menses females (9 and older) and FOCBP at 
each study visit (with the exception of Week 1). Efficacy assessments of the IGA, EASI, Pruritus and Sleep 
Disturbances, TBSA affected by [CONTACT_22802], Subject Assessment, and evaluation for signs and symptoms of atopic 
dermatitis will be performed throughout the study. In addition, the POEM will be completed by [CONTACT_12912]/parents/legal guardians at Week 6 and Week 10.   Number of Subjects Planned:  
Approximately 348 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to the following treatment groups: 
 232 subjects to IDP-124 Lotion, twice daily application  
 116 subjects to IDP-124 Vehicle Lotion, twice daily application

 Safety: 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study:   
- Monitoring of AEs will be conducted at each study visit.  
- Routine clinical laboratory results (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and serum pregnancy 
testing for pre-menses females [9 and older] and FOCBP), vital sign measurements (sitting blood 
pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and temperature), and abbreviated physical examination findings, will be 
conducted at Screening and Week 6 study visits.  
- Urine pregnancy tests (FOCBP, females 9 and older) will be conducted throughout the study (with 
the exception of Week 1). If a subject becomes pregnant during the treatment period, the study drug 
will be discontinued immediately, the subject will be discontinued from the study, and the 
investigator will notify the sponsor. The pregnancy will be followed to term with the outcome 
reported to the sponsor.  
Subjects will be followed for 4 weeks after either completion or early discontinuation from the study to assess 
those AEs ongoing at the time of study completion or leading to discontinuation. Description of AEs will 
include the dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding 
the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and the investigator’s assessment of causality. Any out-of-range 
laboratory result that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_119084]. Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities at any visit will be followed to resolution (return to normal or to the baseline state) or until 
clinically stable as determined by [CONTACT_093].

 Statistical Methods:  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim analyses are 
planned. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of 
significance. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. For categorical 
parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented. For continuous 
parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary, secondary, and 
tertiary efficacy variables. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method will be used (ie, the 
last available on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). 
Additionally, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_119032]. No imputations will be made 
for missing safety data. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. 
The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
Primary efficacy analysis : The primary efficacy endpoint will be used to compare twice daily application of 
IDP-124 Lotion and Vehicle Lotion. The percentage of subjects with treatment success at Week 6 will be 
analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_85229].   
Secondary efficacy analysis : Comparisons of secondary endpoints, will be performed using CMH tests 
stratified by [CONTACT_85229]. Evaluation of the secondary efficacy variables will use a gated sequential 
procedure starting with the comparisons in the predefined order as listed above.  The process will terminate if 
a nonstatistically significant value is observed.  
Tertiary efficacy analysis : For tertiary efficacy endpoints, all but the mean percent change from Baseline in the 
affected TBSA will be analyzed with the CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_85229]. The analysis of TBSA will 
use an Analysis of Covariance with factors of treatment and analysis center and a covariate of the Baseline 
TBSA score. Analyses of tertiary endpoints will be performed without adjusting for multiplicity. 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, the Week 6 per protocol (PP) 
population, and the Week [ADDRESS_236479] 1 confirmed dose of study drug will be included in the 
safety population.

 All subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week 6 visit without any major protocol violations will 
be included in the Week 6 PP population. The Week 6 PP population will include subjects in the ITT 
population who do not meet any of the following criteria: 
 Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
 Used an interfering concomitant medication prior to Week 6; 
 Did not attend the Week 6 visit; 
 Missed more than [ADDRESS_236480] baseline study visit prior to Week 6; 
 Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects must apply 80% - 120% of the 
expected applications of study medication during participation in the study); 
 Out of visit window at the Week 6 visit by [CONTACT_726] ± [ADDRESS_236481] (and/or worsening of condition) will be included in the Week 6 PP population.  
 
All subjects in the Week 6 PP population who complete the Week 10 visit without any major protocol 
violations will be included in the Week 10 PP population. Specifically, the Week 10 PP population will 
include subjects in the Week 6 PP population who did not meet any of the following criteria:  
 Used an interfering concomitant medication between Week 6 and Week 10  
 Did not attend the Week 10 visit  
 Out of visit window at the Week 10 visit by [CONTACT_726] ± [ADDRESS_236482] of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Sample Size Calculations: 
Power calculations were computed using the IGA efficacy results from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119033], 1% (Elidel) 
New Drug Application 21-302. Considerations were given the change in expected entry level severity of the 
current study. Specifically, moderate to severe subjects enrolled in pi[INVESTIGATOR_119034]. Nquery Advisor Version 7.0 with the Fisher’s exact test option was used to calculate the power using 
a two-sided test with an alpha of 0.05. Overall, [ADDRESS_236483] greater than 95% power to detect a statistically significant outcome for a two-sided 
test with an alpha level of 0.05.

 Introduction 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common chronic dermatosis with a prevalence of 10% to 
20% in children and 1% to 3% in adults [ 1]; AD poses difficult therapeutic challenges and 
may have a profound effect on a patient’s quality of life. The disease gives rise to itching and 
severely dry skin, and is characterized by [CONTACT_119085], pruritus, erythema, 
oozing, crusting, excoriations, lichenification, sensitivity to allergens/irritants, and a 
susceptibility to secondary infections [ 2, 3]. 
Reactive treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_119036], but while 
these compounds are effective, they are restricted in long-term use by [CONTACT_119086]. Specifically, the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_119037], telangiectasia, dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], suppression of 
the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis and the rebound effect. Aside from corticosteroids, 
there is only a limited armament of topi[INVESTIGATOR_119038], most of which have 
certain side effects that limit their use.  
Ascomycin derivatives, such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_031], represent a class of anti-inflammatory 
macrolactams that inhibit the phosphatase calcineurin [ 4-6]. Studies on the effect of 
ascomycin derivatives and other immunophilin ligands in animal models of skin 
inflammation provided evidence that they are effective in the treatment of skin diseases in 
humans such as chronic plaque psoriasis, without the well-known side effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_030] [ 7, 8]. Intensive studies on structure-activity relationships and comparative 
pharmacological evaluations resulted in the discovery and development of pi[INVESTIGATOR_031] [ 9, 
10]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119039], targeting T cells 
and mast cells, and inhibiting the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. 
ELIDEL® (pi[INVESTIGATOR_031]) Cream, 1% was approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) in [ADDRESS_236491] using, other topi[INVESTIGATOR_119040]. ELIDEL Cream is an innovative therapeutic agent with a mode of 
action different from topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]; the product is generally safe and has been 
shown to be effective in the treatment of AD. 
In order to improve patient satisfaction with use, the sponsor is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new formulation 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_031]. This formulation will include the same concentration of the active 
ingredient as ELIDEL Cream (pi[INVESTIGATOR_031] 1%), but in a lotion form. It is expected that the 
safety profile of this new formulation, IDP-124 Lotion, will be similar to that of ELIDEL 
Cream. Additionally, the sponsor proposes to evaluate IDP-124 Lotion in patients with 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
[ADDRESS_236492], IDP-124 Lotion will enhance 
and extend the available therapeutic options for patients with AD. 
The current clinical study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
IDP-124 Lotion for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in pediatric and adult subjects.  
 Study Objectives and Purpose 
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IDP-124 
Lotion for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in pediatric and adult subjects.  
 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Investigators and Study Administrative Structure 
Approximately 20 investigational centers are planned to participate in this study. Each 
clinical investigator will be required to provide a copy of his/her curriculum vitae and 
medical license, complete a financial disclosure statement, and generate a list of study 
personnel who will be involved in the study, with a summary of their roles and qualifications. 
7.2 Summary of Study Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, vehicle-controlled study to 
evaluate treatment success using a 5-point Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale from 
clear to severe; the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI); improvement in total affected body 
surface area (TBSA); assessment of pruritus (itching) and sleep disturbance; Patient-Oriented 
Eczema Measure (POEM)  from subjects and parents/legal guardians of pediatric subjects, 
and investigator’s assessment for presence or absence of signs and symptoms of AD. 
Approximately 348 subjects, ages 2 and older, are planned for randomization (232 subjects to 
IDP-124 Lotion and 116 subjects to IDP-124 Vehicle Lotion). The study consists of a 6-week 
double-blind treatment period and 4-week, post-treatment follow-up. Study visits include 
Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 (subjects will return to the clinic at 
Week [ADDRESS_236493]-treatment follow-up visit).  
At the Screening Visit, subjects or their parents/legal guardians (when applicable) will sign 
an informed consent/assent form, provide their medical histories, report their previous and 
concomitant medications, and be evaluated against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pre-
menses females (ages 9 and older) and all females of childbearing potential will have urine 
pregnancy tests performed. An abbreviated physical examination will be performed, vital 
signs measured (sitting blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and temperature), and blood and 
urine specimens will be collected for serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis evaluations 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
21 
 and serum pregnancy for pre-menses females (9 and older) and FOCBP. During this visit, the 
investigator will perform the IGA, evaluate the subject for TBSA affected by [CONTACT_22802], and for the 
other signs and symptoms of AD.  
At the Baseline Visit, prior to being evaluated by [CONTACT_110219], subjects or 
parents/legal guardians (if applicable) are to complete the POEM. At this visit, medical 
histories and concomitant medication use will be updated, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be confirmed. Adverse events since the Screening Visit will be assessed, and all pre-
menses females (9 and older) and FOCBP will have urine pregnancy tests performed. During 
the Baseline Visit, the IGA, EASI, pruritus and sleep disturbance, and subject's assessment of 
AD will be completed, and the investigator will assess TBSA affected by [CONTACT_119087]. 
After confirming eligibility at the Baseline Visit, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive either IDP-124 Lotion or IDP-124 Vehicle Lotion. Subjects or parents/legal 
guardians of pediatric subjects will apply the first dose of the assigned study drug to the 
affected areas of the skin at the investigational center under the supervision of designated 
study personnel. Subjects will receive the study drug and given verbal and written 
instructions for treatment application. Specifically, the subjects will be instructed to apply the 
lotion to the affected areas twice daily, at approximately the same time each day, about 
[ADDRESS_236494] 
of all applications (of study drug and bland emollient use) and to note any missed 
applications of the study drug. 
Throughout the study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_119083] 
(AEs), assessing vital sign measurements and abbreviated physical examination findings 
(conducted at Baseline and Week 6), and noting any additions or changes in concomitant 
medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_119041]. Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening and Week 
6 visits for routine safety laboratory evaluations and serum pregnancy testing, as applicable, 
and urine pregnancy tests will be obtained for all pre-menses females (9 and older) and 
FOCBP at each study visit (except Week 1). Efficacy assessments of the IGA, EASI, Pruritus 
and Sleep Disturbances, TBSA affected by [CONTACT_22802], evaluation for signs and symptoms of AD, 
and Subject Assessment, will be performed throughout the study. In addition, the POEM 
(Appendix 17.3) will be completed by [CONTACT_748]/parents/legal guardians at Baseline, Week 
6 and Week 10.  
Additionally, at selected sites, standardized photography will be performed on subjects who 
provide photographic consent, at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10.  
The study design and schedule of assessments is presented in Table 1 .

Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
[ADDRESS_236505] or whenever clinically necessary, as determined by [CONTACT_099]. The 
End of Study source documents and all relevant data should be entered into the electronic 
case report form (eCRF) system at the time the subject discontinues from the study.  
Reasons for subject withdrawal may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Progression of AD, as determined by [CONTACT_093], which requires treatment 
with a prohibited therapy 
 At the investigator's discretion for safety reasons (e.g., severe adverse reactions or 
unauthorized concomitant therapy) 
 Subject withdrawal 
 When the requirements of the protocol are not followed 
 When a concomitant therapy likely to interfere with the results of the study is 
reported or required by [CONTACT_423] (the investigator will report all such 
information on the source documents/eCRFs and decide, in accordance with the 
sponsor, whether the subject is to be withdrawn) 
 When a subject is lost to follow-up; the investigator (or designee) will try twice to 
reach the subject by [CONTACT_756], email and/or text message, and will send a follow-
up letter by [CONTACT_119089]-up. 
These actions will be documented on the End of Study source documents, and a 
copy of the follow-up letter maintained in the investigator's file 
 If a subject becomes pregnant during the treatment period, the study drug will be 
discontinued immediately, the subject will be discontinued from the study, and 
the investigator will notify the sponsor. The pregnancy will be followed to term 
with the outcome reported to the sponsor. 
 Treatment Plan 
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive one of the two study products in a ratio of 2:1 
(IDP-124 Lotion : Vehicle Lotion). The study center will assign each screened subject a 
unique 6-digit study number. The number will consist of the 3-digit study center number 
(pre-assigned by [CONTACT_2728]/designee) and the 3-digit chronological screening number, starting 
with 001 (e.g., 101001, 101002). The IRT system will assign the study drug kit to subjects 
based on a randomization code at Baseline. One kit will be dispensed to the subjects at 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
[ADDRESS_236506] is to be applied twice daily beginning on Day 1 
for 6 weeks.  
9.2 Randomization and Blinding 
All eligible subjects will be assigned to treatment groups in accordance with a 
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared by [CONTACT_456]’s statistical 
programming group. Approximately 348 subjects are planned for enrollment in a 2:1 ratio in 
the 2 treatment groups (IDP-124 Lotion or Vehicle Lotion).  
This is a double-blinded study in which IDP-[ADDRESS_236507] the investigational products as appropriate to minimize inadvertent unblinding. 
The treatment assignments for all randomized subjects will be unblinded only after the 
conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after: all data are verified, 
entered into the database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and 
entered into the database; and the database is locked. 
In case of a medical emergency, the investigator can contact [CONTACT_119090] 
(or sponsor designee) to obtain the treatment assignment for an individual subject. The 
sponsor is to be informed if the randomization code is broken, along with the reasons for 
unblinding. 
9.3 Treatment Compliance 
Subjects and/or their parents/legal guardians will be dispensed one kit (containing 2 tubes) of 
study drug at the Day 1 (Baseline), Week 2, and Week 4 study visits (see Section 9.1 for IRT 
dispensing at these visits). Using a calibrated scale, designated study personnel will weigh 
and record each tube of study drug within the kit, separately (with cap on) to the nearest tenth 
of a gram, before dispensing both tubes to the subject and/or their parent/legal guardian. 
Subjects will be instructed to return their dispensed study drug tubes at the subsequent visits, 
and weights will be collected. Used, partially used, and unused study drug tubes will be

9.5 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_119092] 
(IRB)/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_093]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual 
patients or a small group of patients and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary 
endpoint criteria.  
A protocol violation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the subject, when the subject or investigator has failed to adhere 
to significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subject was 
enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or when there is nonadherence to [LOCATION_002] FDA 
regulations and/or International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) guideline. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the patients’ source 
documentation any deviations from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a 
deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
subjects without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America

 amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor 
for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required. 
 Study Drug Materials and Management 
The study drug will be provided to the investigational centers by [CONTACT_456] (or sponsor 
designee) and will be dispensed to the subject and their parent/legal guardian (as required) by

 10.1.3  Treatment Administration 
Subjects and their parents/legal guardians will receive both verbal and written instructions 
(Appendix 17.1) on the application of the study drug. Study drug will be applied as a thin 
layer to the affected areas of the skin, twice daily at approximately the same time each day 
and about [ADDRESS_236513] and/or their parent/legal guardian will apply the first 
dose of study drug at the investigational center during the Baseline Visit under the 
supervision of designated study personnel. On subsequent study visit days, subjects will 
apply one dose of study drug at the investigational center, depending on time of study visit 
(subjects should not apply study drug prior to coming in to the center for their study visit if 
the scheduled visit is in the morning). All of the remaining study drug doses will be applied 
at home. Study drug will continue to be applied for the duration of the 6-week treatment 
period, even if complete clearing of the affected areas has been observed; i.e., all originally 
identified lesions will continue to be treated even if cleared (refer to Appendix 17.1).  
New areas of the skin that become affected during the study may be treated with study drug. 
The subject or parent/legal guardian may begin study drug application to new lesion/s 
without the investigator’s confirmation. They must record new lesions on the same body 
diagram provided and in the study diary, and inform the investigator of new lesion treatment 
at the next study visit. 
Non-medicated bland emollients, such as CeraVe®, Eucerin®, or Aquaphor®, may be applied 
during the study at the discretion of the subject and/or parent/legal guardian, and investigator.

2. Record any AEs (query subjects and their parents/legal guardians, “Are there any 
changes in your health since the last visit?”). 
3. Review concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
4. Conduct a urine pregnancy test on all female subjects who are pre-menses (9 and 
older) and females of childbearing potential. 
5. Perform an evaluation of the subject’s TBSA affected by [CONTACT_22802]. 
6. Perform an IGA. 
7. Perform EASI evaluations. 
8. Perform an evaluation of the other signs and symptoms of AD 
(hyper/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], dry skin). 
9. Assess pruritus and sleep disturbance. 
10. Instruct the subject or their parent/legal guardian to assess the degree to which the 
subject’s AD was controlled in the 7 days immediately prior to the visit (i.e., the 
subject’s assessment of AD). 
11. Collect and review subject diary (dispensed from Visit 6 (Week 6)).  
12. At select sites only  – obtain standardized representative photos (refer to the study-
specific photography manual for further details). Photos taken will include a target 
lesion and full front/back images (please refer to photography manual for details). 
13. Exit the subject from the study and complete the end of study eCRFs. 
11.1.5  Unscheduled Visits 
Additional visits may be scheduled, as necessary, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of 
subjects. All additional examinations should be fully documented in the source documents 
and on Unscheduled Visit eCRFs, as appropriate. Visits intended to fulfill scheduled visit 
requirements that fall outside the designated scheduled visit range, are not unscheduled visits. 
In these cases, the visit data will be collected and transcribed to the appropriate scheduled 
visit eCRF.  
11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
11.2.1  Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) 
The investigator will assess the percent of TBSA (≥5% required to qualify at Screening and 
Baseline) affected by [CONTACT_119098]/Baseline and at all study visits.  The percent of TBSA will be assessed by [CONTACT_119099] (palm including all the digits) method.

Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
42 
 When utilizing the handprint (palm including all the digits) method to asses a subject’s 
TBSA estimation, the outstretched hand (including all five digits adducted together) equals 
approximately 1% of the subject’s TBSA.  NOTE:  The subject’s hand is the hand of 
reference and not the assessor’s hand. 
11.2.2  Investigators Global Assessment  
At Screening, Day 1 (Baseline), Week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 study visits (all visits), AD severity 
will be determined by [CONTACT_093]/evaluator based on a global assessment of the 
inflammatory signs of AD. Evaluations will be graded on a static scale ranging from 0 (clear) 
to 4 (severe) as shown in the following table: 
Score Grade Description 0 Clear No inflammatory signs of AD (no erythema, no induration/papulation, no 
lichenification, no oozing/crusting). Post-inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_119065]/or hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_22765]. 
[ADDRESS_236525] clear Barely perceptible erythema, barely perceptible induration/papulation, and/or 
minimal lichenification. No oozing or crusting.  
2 Mild Slight but definite erythema (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]), slight but definite induration/papulation, 
and/or slight but definite lichenification. No oozing or crusting. 
3 Moderate Clearly perceptible erythema (dull red), clearly perceptible 
induration/papulation, and/or clearly perceptible lichenification. Oozing and 
crusting may be present. 
4 Severe Marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked induration/papulation, and/or 
marked lichenification. Disease is wide-spread in extent. Oozing or crusting 
may be present.  
 
The primary efficacy variable is the IGA score at Week 6. Treatment success is defined as 
achieving clear to almost clear (i.e., a score of 0 or 1) and at least a 2-grade improvement in 
the IGA score at the end of treatment compared with Baseline.  
11.2.3  Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) 
At Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10,  the EASI will be calculated. The EASI is 
defined as a composite score based on the evaluated severity of 4 key signs of AD 
(i.e., erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification), and the extent of 
disease in each of the 4 body regions (i.e., head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). 
The area of involvement (affected by [CONTACT_2898], not including dry skin) of each of the 
4 body regions will be determined and represented by a numeric coded value based on a scale 
from 0 to 6 as described below (the investigator is required to record the affected TBSA on 
the eCRF).

6 90%-100% 
 
The 4 body regions are assessed separately for each sign/symptom, and the average degree of 
severity of each sign in each of the 4 body parts is assigned a score of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) 
on a scale that allows half-unit increments.

 The EASI score (range from 0 to 72) will then be calculated using the following formula:  
Body Region EASI Score 
Head/neck (E+I+EX+L) x Area x P* 
Upper limbs (E+I+EX+L) x Area x P* 
Trunk (E+I+EX+L) x Area x P* 
Lower limbs (E+I+EX+L) x Area x P* 
Total body score =  Sum of each region score  
E = erythema; I = infiltration/papulation; EX = excoriation; L = lichenification 
Area is defined on a 7-point scale, where 0 = no eruption, 1 = < 10%, 2 = 10%-29%, 3 = 30%-49%, 4 = 50%-69%, 
5 = 70%-89%, 6 = ≥ 90%

11.2.4  Pruritus and Sleep Disturbance 
At Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10, the subject or parent/legal guardian of 
pediatric subjects will assess pruritus and sleep disturbance on 4-point scales as described 
below. Subjects will be instructed to recall the severity based on a 24-hour period prior to the 
study visit.  
Score Grade Description Pruritus 
0 None None

At Day 1 (Baseline), Week 6 (end of treatment) and Week 10 (end of study), adult subjects 
and parents/legal guardians of pediatric subjects will complete the POEM questionnaire (see 
Appendix 17.3). The POEM questionnaire is a self-assessment of atopic eczema symptoms 
for adult subjects and for parents/legal guardians of children ( 11, 12 ). The POEM for Self-
Assessment questionnaire should be completed by [CONTACT_1766] ≥8 years of age, and the POEM 
for Proxy Completion should be completed by [CONTACT_3654]/legal guardians of pediatric subjects 
less than [ADDRESS_236530] sites, photographs will be taken at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 10. Only 
subjects who provide written photographic consent for photographs will be included in 
photography. Reference shall be made to the photographic manual for this study. 
11.3 Evaluation of Safety 
11.3.1  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for routine safety laboratory tests (hematology, 
serum chemistry, and urinalysis) at Screening and Week 6 (or ET). Any subject with a 
screening laboratory abnormality that is determined by [CONTACT_119103]. All results 
will be reported, including abnormal results. Clinically significant changes in lab results from 
Screening, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], should be reported as AEs. Clinically significant 
changes present at Week 6 (or ET) are to be followed to resolution or until clinically stable as 
determined by [CONTACT_093]. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the 
test must be obtained by [CONTACT_119104]’s documentation. 
Materials for sample collection will be provided to the investigational centers by [CONTACT_119105]. Instructions for processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_119067]-specific laboratory manual.

47 
 For all female subjects who are pre-menses (9 and older) and females of childbearing 
potential, a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at Screening and Week 6 (or ET). 
Additionally, urine pregnancy testing will be performed at all study visits (except Week 1). 
The results at the Screening and Baseline visits must be negative for a subject to enter the 
study. Materials for pregnancy testing will be provided to the investigational centers by [CONTACT_103], CRO or central laboratory. 
11.3.2  Vital Sign Measurements 
Measurement of vital signs will be performed at Screening and Week 6 (or ET). After the 
subjects have been sitting for at least 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse 
rates, respi[INVESTIGATOR_119068], and oral temperatures will be recorded (for younger pediatric subjects, 
aural or temporal temperatures will be allowed provided the same method is used across all 
study visits). 
11.3.3  Physical Examinations 
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Screening and Week 6 (or ET). 
Height and weight will be measured at both visits.

clinical study, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. The 
collection of non-serious AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) should begin following the subject’s 
completion of the consent/assent process to participate in the study. 
Descriptions of AEs will include the dates of onset and resolution, maximum severity, 
seriousness, action taken regarding study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and 
investigator’s assessment of causality. Worsening of disease will not be considered an AE 
unless it results in discontinuation of the subject from the study or requires medical 
intervention prohibited by [CONTACT_760]. All AEs will be followed to resolution or until stable 
as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or non-serious. An SAE or serious adverse reaction 
is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
48 
  Is immediately life-threatening, (the term “life-threatening” in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an 
AE) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes 
Important medical events that may not have resulted in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for assessment of seriousness. To qualify as serious under the 
criteria of “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],” a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119069] a 24-hour period is required. If a 
subject is retained the emergency room greater than 24 hours, but not admitted for medical 
care, these cases should be evaluated individually, as criteria such as “medically significant” 
may also apply.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18516] a medical AE should not be considered either serious or an AE. 
Examples include the following: 
 Admission for treatment of a pre-existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with worsening of the pre-existing condition (e.g., 
for work-up of persistent pretreatment lab abnormality) 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a purpose unrelated to the study (e.g.,, “planned” or elective 
surgery scheduled prior to study participation) would not ordinarily need to be 
reported, unless a complication occurred which otherwise caused prolongation of 
this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119070] V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America

  Protocol-specified admission or procedure (e.g., cataract surgery required by a 
study protocol; or overnight stay for monitoring due to protocol required surgery, 
with no associated SAE or complication necessitating prolonged stay) 
 Social admission (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) 
Note: A spontaneous abortion and elective abortion will be considered as SAEs, and must be 
reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of your awareness of the event. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity and Causality of Adverse Events 
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. 
The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs: 
 Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom but is easily tolerated, requires no 
treatment and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate:  Low level of concern to the subject and may interfere with daily 
activities, but can be relieved by [CONTACT_119106].  
 Severe:  Interrupts the subject’s daily activity and requires systemic therapy or 
other treatment.  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related.”  
 Related:  There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study drug. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
 Not Related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is 
related to the study drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no 
temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely or certain alternative 
etiology exists. 
The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE causality: 
 Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was 
withdrawn and the SAE resolved or the event recurred after re introduction 
 If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or 
concomitant illness 
 Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
50 
  No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists 
 If the AE is directly related to study procedures or there is a lack of efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Throughout the course of the study, efforts will be made by [CONTACT_119107]. The period of observation for 
collection of AEs extends from the time the subject and parent/legal guardian gives informed 
consent/assent until the last study visit or discontinuation from the study. The first concern 
will be the safety of the subject, and appropriate medical intervention will be made.  
The investigator or designee will elicit reports (i.e., via direct questioning, observation, 
clinical evaluation) of AEs from the subject at each study visit and record all AEs. The 
investigator will document the dates of onset, progress, outcome, and resolution of such AEs. 
The investigator will also provide an assessment of all AEs as to the severity, causal 
relationship to study drug, and causal relationship to study protocol.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to document all AEs that occur during the study. The 
AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE 
should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_119108]/or their parent/legal guardian at each study visit.  
All AEs occurring after the subject and their parent/legal guardian signs the assent/informed 
consent through the last study visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs 
are considered drug-related. All AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_119109], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_3184]/or their parent/legal guardian, 
will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring 
a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE. The 
following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate eCRF: 
 Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
 Onset date and end date 
 Maximum intensity (severity) 
 Seriousness 
 Action taken regarding study drug 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
51 
  Corrective treatment, if given 
 Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded. 
Any SAE must be reported to the sponsor, independent of the circumstance or suspected 
cause, within [ADDRESS_236532] deemed medically significant, only SAEs 
considered related to the study drug should be reported promptly to the sponsor. 
Within 24 hours of notification the investigator will fax or email a completed Serious 
Adverse Event Report to the following:  
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to document the event before 
notifying the sponsor of an SAE. If only limited information is initially available, follow-up 
reports are required. If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding a 
SAE (ie, resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE Form must be 
completed and faxed/emailed to the sponsor within 24 hours. The original SAE Form is not 
to be altered. The report should be marked as a “follow-up report” and describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues and how the event was treated. Additional relevant 
information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119071].  
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to 
investigational product) that occurs within [ADDRESS_236533] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 

Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
52 
 The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_456]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Submitting an Expedited Safety Report to the Institutional Review Board  
Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction warrants expedited reporting. In addition, 
any unexpected SAE related to a subject’s participation in the study (or conduct of study), 
regardless if the study drug was administered, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_119110]. For example, an unexpected, 
serious and severe reaction which could be associated to the study procedures, and which 
could modify the study conduct requires expedited reporting. 
Each expedited safety report will routinely include a brief cover memorandum, the 
completed MedWatch Form FDA 3500A or Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences I Form, a clinical analysis of the event with any similar events that have 
occurred with the product, and any additional pertinent information recommended by [CONTACT_119111]. Once the report is compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], the clinical center investigator must 
submit the expedited safety report to the local IRB/IEC within the required reporting 
timeframe. Follow-up reports should be submitted when requested or when pertinent 
information becomes available. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_119072] a complete copy of 
each expedited safety report as it was submitted to the IRB/IEC. It is important that the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_119073], as they contain safety information that 
may be relevant to each of the participating subjects. 
11.3.5  Pregnancy 
All pre-menses females (9 and older) and female subjects of childbearing potential must use 
an effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk 
of contraceptive failure is minimized. Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method. 
Before enrolling a female subject of childbearing potential in this clinical study, the 
investigator must review the following information about study participation: 
 Informed consent/assent requirements. 
 Contraceptives in current use. 
Following review of this information and appropriate counseling for the subject and their 
parent/legal guardian, the investigator or designee and the subject and parent/legal guardian 
must sign the assent/informed consent before study enrollment. 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
53 
 During the study, all pre-menses females (9 and older) and female subjects of childbearing 
potential should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_119112] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing 
are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must 
not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study 
treatment, the study drug must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing 
is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the 
subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be 
submitted to the sponsor, initially within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness and at the 
end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications 
occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery. If a pregnancy is associated with an SAE, 
and SAE report form and the pregnancy report form should be submitted to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of the investigators awareness. 
 Statistics 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be 
performed at the 0.05 level of significance. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be 
presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of 
subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Appropriate 
inferential statistics will be used for the primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy variables. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation 
carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation 
for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). Additionally, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_119074]. No imputations will be made for 
missing safety data. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments.

Covariance with factors of treatment and analysis center and a covariate of the baseline 
TBSA score. Analyses of tertiary endpoints will be performed without adjusting for 
multiplicity. 
12.5.4  Pooling Analysis 
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site 
with the intention of pooling the data for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote 
consistency in study execution at each study site. The study is intended to be conducted in a 
manner such that a minimum of 15 subjects will be randomized and included in the ITT 
population (i.e., approximately at least [ADDRESS_236547] 
5 subjects in the Vehicle Lotion arm) for any investigational site. In the event that there are 
too few subjects in a treatment arm for an investigator, then the investigator’s data will be 
combined to achieve the desired sample size minimum per treatment arm. The combining of 
investigator data will be accomplished, within geographic region, by [CONTACT_119115], restricted 
to investigational sites that did not meet minimum enrollment. If there is a further need to 
combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be 
combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment, and so on. 
This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of [ADDRESS_236548] insufficient subjects per 
treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of

57 
 statistical analyses. These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the 
statistical analyses. 
The consistency of treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers 
subsequent to combining the data as described above. Statistical tests will be conducted to 
identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common 
statistical and clinical conclusions. For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment 
response, the primary efficacy variable will be considered. The percent of subjects with 
treatment success at Week [ADDRESS_236549] been identified, then the treatment p-values 
of the remaining analysis centers will be computed. Inferences will be drawn from the 
treatment p-value, as well as any pertinent observations regarding the extreme analysis center 
Protocol V01-124A-302  Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America 
 
Version 5.0 (Amendment #4), 25NOV2019  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
[ADDRESS_236550] will be investigated to determine if the main site-to-site variability is such 
that it could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, the percent of subjects 
with treatment success at Week 6 will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of 
treatment group, site, and the interaction term of treatment group by [CONTACT_3725]. If the analysis is not 
computationally feasible due to some sites having very few subjects enrolled, the low 
enrolling sites will be excluded from the analysis. 
12.5.5  Sensitivity Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analyses Using Last Observation Carried Forward 
In the first set of sensitivity analyses, missing IGA values will be imputed using LOCF. 
Treatment success at Week 6 will be analyzed as it was in the primary analyses. Comparisons 
will be performed on imputed data using CMH tests stratified by [CONTACT_85229]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repeated Measures Analysis on Observed Data 
As a second sensitivity analysis, treatment success at Week 6 will be analyzed with a 
repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with 
treatment success as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center and visit 
(Weeks 1, 2, , 4 and 6) as independent factors.

12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations 
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or higher unless 
otherwise stated. A SAP, describing all statistical analyses, will be provided as a separate 
document prior to database lock. 
12.8.1  Analysis Populations 
Approximately 348 subjects with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis (defined as an IGA 
score of 3 or 4) will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 2:1 randomization ratio, 
it is anticipated that: 
• Approximately 232 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-124 Lotion 
• Approximately 116 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-124 Vehicle Lotion 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population, the Week 6 PP population, 
and the Week 10 PP population. The ITT analysis set will be considered primary for the 
evaluation of efficacy. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population during 
the treatment period (Baseline to Week 6), and during the post treatment period (Week 6 to 
Week 10). 
All subjects who are randomized and dispensed study drug will be included in the ITT 
population. 
All subjects who are randomized and receive at least 1 confirmed dose of study drug will be 
included in the safety population. 
All subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week 6 visit without any major protocol 
violations will be included in the Week 6 PP population. The Week 6 PP population will 
include subjects in the ITT population who did not meet any of the following criteria: 
 Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Used an interfering concomitant medication prior to Week 6 
 Did not attend the Week 6 visit 
 Missed more than [ADDRESS_236552]-baseline study visit prior to Week 6

  Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects must apply 80% 
120% of the expected applications of study medication during participation in the 
study) 
 Out of visit window at the Week 6 visit by [CONTACT_726] ± [ADDRESS_236553] (and/or worsening of condition) will be included in the 
Week 6 PP population.  
All subjects in the Week 6 PP population who complete the Week 10 visit without any major 
protocol violations will be included in the Week 10 PP population. Specifically, the Week 10 
PP population will include subjects in the Week 6 PP population who did not meet any of the 
following criteria:  
 
 Used an interfering concomitant medication between Week 6 and Week 10  
 Did not attend the Week 10 visit 
 Out of visit window at the Week 10 visit by [CONTACT_726] ± [ADDRESS_236554] of the trial that result in noteworthy 
study protocol violations. 
The number of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Reasons for study 
withdrawal during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages 
by [CONTACT_1570]. 
12.8.2  Sample Size Determination 
The following power calculations were computed using the IGA efficacy results from the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_119035], 1% (Elidel) NDA 21-302. Considerations were given the change in 
expected entry level severity of the current study. Nquery Advisor Version 7.0 with the 
Fisher’s exact test option was used to calculate the power using a 2-sided test with an alpha 
of 0.05. The following table presents the efficacy estimates used in this power calculation.

 * Success was defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline in the IGA score and an IGA score 
equating to “Clear” or “Almost Clear”. 
 
Overall, [ADDRESS_236555] greater than 95% power to detect a statistically significant outcome for a 2-sided test 
with an alpha level of 0.05.  
It was noted that the estimates extracted from the above studies are based on the LOCF 
method of handling missing values while the proposed Phase 3 analysis will account for 
missing values using multiple imputations. The power stated above sufficiently exceeds 95% 
which will compensate for the difference in handling of missing data. 
12.8.3  Handling of Missing Data 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. 
This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, 
imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of 
missing observations in 1 treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in 
another. 
For each efficacy variable (IGA, EASI, pruritus severity), the following steps will be 
performed to impute missing data: 
1. For each treatment group, create a data set containing subjects with observed 
values and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing efficacy data in each 
data set will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets. 
The resulting data set for each treatment group will be combined into 1 complete 
data set for each imputation.  
2. Syntax: 
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5 <options>; 
where trtpn=(1 or 2); 
mcmc chain=multiple; 
var baseline week1 week2 week4 week6 week10; 
run; 
3. Imputed data will be used to determine dichotomized success/failure values, as 
appropriate. 
4. Each complete data set will be analyzed with the appropriate test (CMH, Analysis 
of Covariance). 
5. CMH statistics will be normalized using the Wilson-Hilferty transformation. 
6. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.

Only subjects are to record information in subject diaries and questionnaires. In no instance, 
should an investigator or clinical center personnel record any data or make changes to 
subject-completed forms. The investigator or designee should review subject-completed 
forms during study visits. If an entry is found to be illegible or a mistake is found (e.g., an 
incorrect year was recorded), the subject should be instructed to edit the entry by [CONTACT_740] a 
single line through the original entry, entering the new information, dating, and writing 
subject’s year of birth to acknowledge. 
Upon study completion or at any other time specified by [CONTACT_36613], the 
appropriate study documents must be submitted to the sponsor.  
Telephone conversations and electronic mail with the subject, the sponsor, or the sponsor’s 
designee concerning the study must be recorded or kept on file.  
The investigator will allow representatives of the sponsor’s monitoring team, the governing 
IRB/IEC, the FDA, and other applicable regulatory agencies to inspect all study records, 
eCRFs, and corresponding portions of the subject’s clinic and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119080]. These inspections are for the purpose of verifying 
adherence to the protocol, completeness and accuracy of the data being entered onto the

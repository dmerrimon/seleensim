Study design  
This is a single -center, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo- controlled, dose response , 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic study evaluating the effects of A3309 on gastric, intestinal 
and colonic transit in patients with functional constipation. D oses of 15 or 20 m g A3309 or matching 
placebo will be administered orally  once daily  for fourteen (1 4) consecutive days.  
 
Aim  
To assess the dose related effects of A3309 on small bowel and overall colonic transit  and bowel 
function in patients with functional constipation.    
Primary endpoint : 
Colonic geometric center at 24 h as measured by [CONTACT_298754], as compared to placebo. 
 
Secondary endpoints:   
1. Colonic filling at 6 h measured by [CONTACT_298754], as compared to placebo.  
2. T 1/2 
3. Colonic geometric center at 48 h measured by [CONTACT_298754], as compared to placebo. of ascending colon emptying measured by [CONTACT_298754], as compared to placebo.  
4. T 1/[ADDRESS_959549] -treatment period. 
6. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic characteristics for each dose of A3309. 
7. Assess the safety and tolerability of A3309 a dministered as an oral tablet.  
 
Number of patients  planned  
Twelve female patient s with functional constipation in each treatment group  for a total  
of 36 patients . 
Diagnosis and main eligibility cri teria  
Patients with diagnosed functional constipation will be recruited from the local community by [CONTACT_706231] a targeted mailing of an informational letter.

 Methodology  
Female p atients with functional constipation will be screened for eligibility and informed about the 
study during pre- screening dialogue and also at the initial Visit 1 screen.  
Within seven (7) to fourteen (14) days of Visit 1, eligible patients will return for an abbreviated 
scintigraphy  test with images obtained only at [ADDRESS_959550] be less than 2.3 0, the median of normal colonic transit in normal 
healthy volunteers (as determined by [CONTACT_227976] a compi[INVESTIGATOR_706190]),  to qualify 
for randomization to study medication, either 15 or 20 mg A3309 or placebo administered orally once 
daily for fourteen (1 4) consecutive days.  The allocation to treatment group will be concealed.  
Study medication will be administered at the Charlton 7 Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at Visit 4, 5, 
and 6, the days of scintigraphic assessment of gastric, small bowel and colonic transit of solids 
performed over a 48 hour period.  
Within seven (7) to ten (10) days of Visit 6, patients will return to the Charlton [ADDRESS_959551], dosage and mode of administration  
 
Patients will take 15 or 20 m g of A3309 or placebo administered orally for eleven  (11) consecutive 
days and report for post- study medication transit scintigraphy  on day twelve  (12) of do sing. Study 
medication will be administered once with the In111
  capsule on Visit 4 and once immediately before 
the camera images obtained on Visits 5 and 6.  Study medication will be administered at Charlton 7 
CRU by [CONTACT_706232].  
Duration of treatment  
A3309 or matching placebo will be administered orally  once daily for fourteen (1 4) consecutive days.  
 
Duration of patient s involvement in the study  
 Each patient will attend s even (7)  visits at the clinic during a period of about thirty -one (31) to forty -
one (41) d ays.  
 
Efficacy assessments  
 
• Scintigraphic small bowel and colonic transit 
• Assessment of stool frequency and consistency using the Bowel Pattern Diary 
• Symptoms of constipation 
• Overall treatment effects  
 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis  
Blood samples for analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be collected at Visit 4, before 
dosing and at  30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, [ADDRESS_959552] dosing. Pharmacodynamic parameters 
(C4, total cholesterol , HDL,  LDL  and triglycerides ) will be coll ected at Visit 1, Visit  4 and Visit 7 . 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  4(89) 07 June 2010  
  
PK parameters will be analyzed using conventional analyses by [CONTACT_55412], [LOCATION_006] 
 
Safety assessments  
 
The following safety assessments will be performed:  
 
• Laboratory safety tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic 
panel (CMP), coagulation studies and a urinalysis  (UA)  performed at Visit 1 study entry, 
Visit 4 transit scintigraphy and Visit 7 study completion.  A urine screen for drugs of abuse 
will be performed once at Visit 1 study entry. 
• A 12- lead ECG performed at Visit 1 study entry , Visit 4 and Visit 7 study completion.  
• A physical examination by a study physician at Visit 1 study entry , Visit 6  and Visit 7 study 
completion  and as necessary throughout the study.  
• Weight and vital signs (inc luding temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) at 
every visit   
• Urine pregnancy tests performed at Visit [ADDRESS_959553]-study medication transit 
scintigraphy at Visit 2 and Visit 4, respectively    
• Interview for concomitant medications and adverse events at every visit  
 
Statistical methods  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare transit parameters and patient bowel 
patter n diary summaries (ie, stool frequency, mean stool consistency  and mean ease of passage 
scores)  among the treatment groups. The covariates considered for inclusion in the analyses are age, 
body mass index (BMI) and the corresponding baseline (pre- treatment ) bowel pattern diary 
summaries.  If necessary  a suitable transformation for potential skewness in the distributions of 
measured responses or heterogenous variation among treatment groups may be used (e.g., ANCOVA 
on ranks or square root, transformed stool frequency.) 
If the ANCOVA test for overall treatment effects for a given response has  a p value less than or 
equal to 0.10, then both the 15 mg and 20 mg doses will be compared to placebo using Dunnett’s test . 
Since each of the primary endpoints assesses a separate hypothesis regarding the effects of A3309, no 
adjustment in the alpha level for testing multiple types of endpoints is anticipated, and a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05 will be used in each ANCOVA model.  
Statistical Power  
 
Based on data acquired using the same methods in the laboratory, the sample size of 12 patient s per 
group provides 80% power to detect differences of approximately 27% to 37%  in colon ic transit, the 
primary endpoints.  This magnitude of change is considered clinically s ignificant. 
 
Pharmacokinetic  and P harmacodynamic  analyses  
Plasma concentration of A3309 vs time curves will be plotted for each subject, on both linear/linear 
and log 10/linear scales. Mean plasma concentration vs time curves will also be presented by [CONTACT_2715], PK  
and PD parameters. . Exploratory analyses of the PD variables will be conducted and described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

 Efficacy  analyses  
Exploratory analyses of the efficacy variables will be conducted and described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).   
 Analysis data sets  
The primary analyses will follow the intent to treat (ITT) paradigm with all patients randomized 
included in the analyses. Those patients with missing response values will have their missing values 
imputed via the overall ( patient s with non- missing data) mean and a corresponding adjustment in the 
ANCOVA residual error variance degrees of freedom (subtracting one for each missing value 
imputed). 
Safety data will be presented for all patients receiving investigational  product.

5.1  Ethical review  
Necessary approvals of the study protocol  and the informed consent form (ICF) must be obtained before 
enrol lment of any patient into the study. I t is the responsibility of the  Principal  Investigator (PI) to keep 
the Insti tutional Review Board (IRB)  informed of any S erious  Adverse Events (SAEs) and any substantial 
amendments to the protocol during the study period.  
The written approval from the IRB , including study identification and the date of review will be filed at 
the study site together with a list of the IRB members, their titles or occupation, and their institutional 
affiliations. All correspondence with the IRB should be filed both at the Sponsor and at the study site. 
5.[ADDRESS_959559] of the study  
The study will be performed in accordance with the recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical 
research involving human subjects that were adopted in 1964 by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical Assembly, in Helsinki, Finland, with later revisions.  
5.3 Patient  information and consent  
Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_706234] a review of the 
written ICF and a conversation outlining the risks, benefits, and goals of the investigation.  The patient 
will be informed about the right to withdraw  from the study at any time and should be allowed sufficient 
time for consideration of the proposal. Documentation will be recorded with signatures of the study participant and the individual obtaining consent (on the standard informed consent document) before any 
study- specific procedures are performed, including screening procedures.

Albireo  10(89) [ADDRESS_959560] which includes sufficient information to link 
records, i.e. the Case Report Form ( CRF ) and the electronic med ical record (EMR) . This list will be 
preserved for possible future inspections/audits but should not be made available to the Sponsor except 
for monitoring or auditing purposes. 
All data retrieved during the study will be used specifically for research pur poses .  Results will be 
maintained in Excel spreadsheets and SAS datasets stored electronically and will be password protected.  
Mayo Clinic IRB guidelines for anonymizing data will be strictly adhered to.  Only de- identified data will 
be permitted to be sent outside of Mayo Clinic.  The ICF specifies that authorized  representatives from 
the Sponsor , the IRB, FDA and other r egulatory authorities  will be granted access to the patient’s medical 
record in a limited capacity for the purpose of  verification of c linical study procedures. 
5.[ADDRESS_959561] that the study medication is well tolerated. In 26 normal healthy 
volunteers, the adverse events observed were: flatulence (27 percent), abdominal distension (19 percent), 
abdominal pain and nasopharyngitis (12 percent each), and diarrhea, nausea and headache, (2 percent 
each). In 25 constipation patients, the adverse events observed were: abdominal distension , nausea and 
headache (8 percent each) . There was no relation of AEs to the dose levels tested. Further information is 
available in the Investigator´s Brochure Section 6.1  
A Dat a Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this study has been established in accordance with 
recommendation by [CONTACT_706235] .  We justify the proposal on the following rationale , that  the 
study involves the use of radiation that is within limits permissible for patients with functional 
constipation. The study drug safety to date in healthy volunteers and patients with constipation has been 
excellent.  
Radiation exposure in this study comes from the 99mTc and 111
 In used to measure gut transit . These 
exposures conform to previously approved levels of radiation exposure approved by [CONTACT_706236]. The radiation dosimetry and organ exposures (in mrad) are listed below:

In summary, A3309 has a good safety profile, and the most commonly reported a dverse events ( AEs) in 
previous studies have been  of gastrointestinal origin  presumably reflecting the Mechanism of Action of 
A3309 and the subject cohort studied.  The risks to the participants are reasonable since most procedures 
are noninvasive and there is no obvious risk of any significant morbidity or mortality.

 7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1    Background 
Constipation and C-IBS are very common clinical problems. A questionnaire study in Olmsted County, 
Minnesot a demonstrated that up to 20% of patients report constipation ( 1) and up to 16% have some form 
of irritable bowel syndrome. Clinical practice suggests that patients transition between these two diagnoses, and it is also evi dent that the symptoms of these disorders overlap those of evacuation 
disorders such as pelvic floor dyssynergia. Thus, approximately 40% of patients with functional constipation have historical evidence of needing to strain excessively to pass bowel movements.  These features might suggest that they also have a component of an evacuation disorder, although the 
questionnaire-based data did not allow a sufficient distinction between an evacuation problem and slow 
transit constipation.  In a tertiary center s tudy, 50% of [ADDRESS_959565] over a 3 -year period had impaired evacuation, and the remainder of 
patients had either normal or slow transit constipation (
2). Moreover, the cardinal "Manning" criterion of 
sense of incomplete rectal evacuation is conceivably a manifestation of a disturbance of rectal evacuation.  
In clinical practice, it is essential to identify the presence of an evacuation disorder, particularly since the 
management of constipation should be modified by [CONTACT_706237] ( 3).  Biofeedback- based physical therapy 
is more effective than any other form of therapy when spastic pelvic floor disorders are identified.   
Therefore, patients with an evacuation  disorder will be excluded from participating in this study. 
A subgroup of patients ( 3,4) has functional or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), in which there is no 
evacuation diso rder and colonic transit is slow or normal, but is not accelerated at baseline.  This group of 
patients has a variable component of pain in association with constipation, and hence overlaps in time 
with C -IBS. 
The cause of abnormal colonic transit in funct ional constipation, CIC and C- IBS is still incompletely 
understood; over the last three decades, histological studies have suggested that there may be quantitative differences in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), substance P (excitatory nerves reduced) and 
VIP or nitrergic (inhibitory nerves increased) neurons in the myenteric plexus of resected specimens of 
colons from patients with severe constipation.  However, these results have not been consistently 
reported.   
 
7.2 Current Approaches to Treatment of Constipation and C- IBS 
Patients with constipation tend to benefit from fiber, osmotic laxatives (magnesium salts, PEG 3350 solutions), and stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl), although the efficacy of these in treatment of CIC, C-
IBS and functional constipation is limited, even with recently approved medications such as lubiprostone. 
Prokinetics such as tegaserod have been withdrawn from the market.  There is a spectrum of potential medications such as [ADDRESS_959566] a variety of physiologic functions and are actively reabsorbed (up to 95%) in the terminal 
ileum (5). Disruption of the enterohepati c circulation of bile acids due to ileal disease (e.g., Crohn’s or

 radiation ileitis) or idiopathic bile acid malabsorption (BAM) causes chronic diarrhea [see systematic 
summary (6)]. Conjugated and non- conjugated bile acid s induce secretion in the human colon (7,8) by 
[CONTACT_706238] [e.g. adenylate cyclase (9)] or by [CONTACT_706239] ( 10), increased mucosal permeability (11) and inhibition of api[INVESTIGATOR_706192]- /OH- exchange 
(12). In addition, bile acids may induce propulsive contractions in canine [>20mM ( 13)] and human colon 
[1mM ( 14) or 5mM ( 15)]. In humans, there is a relationship between the fecal bile acid excretion and 
colonic motility; however, this relationship is complicated by [CONTACT_706240] (15) since the 
delivery of fatty acids to the colon may also accelerate colonic transit ( 16). Bile acid concentration in 
stool of patients with ileal resection may reach 21mM chenodeoxycholate [CDC ( 17)].  However, fecal 
concentrations of bile acids in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) or functional diarrhea are unknown, and up-regulation of the ileal active transporter (
18) as a result of chronic loss of 
bile acids may reduce the bile acids reaching the colon. In studies of gallstone dissolution with 750-
1000mg CDC per day ( 19), diarrhea  occurred in 40% of patients ( 20). Therefore, an approach that results 
in the passage of higher concentrations of endogenous bile acids into the colon has the potential to provide a useful treatment for constipation and related conditions. Structure activity studies show that 
several primary and secondary bile acids are secretagogues in the mammalian colon (
11).  
 
7.4 Safety of Delivering Higher Concentration s of Bile Acids to the Colon in  
Humans  
The literature on gallstone dissolution shows that 37% of patients treated with typi[INVESTIGATOR_706193] 14-
15 mg per kg per day had effectively dissolved gallstones (21) and had hypertransaminasemia (within 3 
times upper limit of normal) in the first 6 months of treatment ( 22). On the other hand, doses of 7-20 mg 
CDC kg -1 day-1 were not hepatotoxic in humans  (23). Among patients with gallstones  treated wi th CDC 
(over 1000mg day-1 for several months), and patients who underwent partial ileal by[CONTACT_706241][INVESTIGATOR_035], there are no reports of colon cancer ( 24). 
 
7.[ADDRESS_959567] to relieve constipation, especially with 
a locally acting agent that inhibits reuptake of bile acids by [CONTACT_599483][INVESTIGATOR_706194].  
Such an agent is A 3309.  From an academic perspective, this study also provides the opportunity to prove 
the principle that endogenous bile acids are effective laxatives to normalize bowel function , and also they 
provide proof of concept that bile acid malabsorption may be very relevant (and therefore targets for 
therapy) for patients with chronic diarrhea.
       
8 DESCRIPTION OF A3309 
8.1 Chemistry  
A3309 is a stereochemically pure enantiomer with a molecular weight of 695.9 g/mol.  It is an acid with 
an acid dissociation constant (pKa) of approximately 4, the pH at which half of the molecules are ionized.  As aqueous solubility is pH dependent, higher pH results in increased solubility.

 The expected shor t half -life (t ½

36H45N3O7S2
The chemical structure of A3309 is:  . 
 
  
  
Bile acids are mainly absorbed by a specific ileal bile acid transporter in the ileum (IBAT) and are 
returned to the liver, completing enterohepatic circulation ( 25).  A3309 is a small molecule known to be 
an inhibitor of the IBAT that interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by [CONTACT_706242], which results in an increased bile acid load to the colon.  This stimulates increased 
fluid secretion in the colon and colonic motility; both effects are expected to benefit patients with 
constipation ( 7).  Additionally, given the mode of action of A3309, beneficial effects on bile acid 
synthesis and cholesterol levels are anticipated  (25). Bile acid reabsorption from the intestine is a very 
efficient process whereby 95% of the secreted bile acids are reabsorbed and IBAT, an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that co-transports sodium and bile acid, appears to be a major regulator of 
the bile acid pool in animals and man. IBAT inhibitors prevent the reabsorption of bile acids from the 
ileum and their return to the liver.  The liver compensates for this decrease in bile acid level by 
[CONTACT_706243] 7 α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis(
26, 2 7).
8.2 Pharmacology   
 
A3309 is a small molecule known to be an inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT), [synonym: 
Api[INVESTIGATOR_706195] (ASBT)]. It has previously been evaluated for the 
treatment in dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_706196]. The expected 
short half- life (t ½

A3309 is a potent inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter in human, mouse and canine IBAT- transfected 
cells as demonstrated by [CONTACT_706244] (IC 50
 =0.53, 0.13 and 5.8 nM 
respectively).  
Orally administered A3309 showed a dose- dependent inhi bitory effect on the intestinal bile acid 
absorption in mouse with an ED 50
  value of 0.3 mg/kg. Moreover, A3309 showed a dose-dependent 
reduction (maximal effect 38%) of plasma cholesterol in the  ApoE/LDLr KO mouse (transgenic mouse 
model showing a human- like lipoprotein profile). The cholesterol reduction was seen within the 
chylomicron/VLDL and LDL- fractions, whereas HDL -cholesterol fraction was increased.  
The pharmacodynamic effect of A3309 was investigated in the one- month toxicity studies in rat and in 
dog by [CONTACT_706245] 7α -hydroxy-4- cholesten -3-one (C4), a biomarker for bile 
acid synthesis. An increase of C4 in plasma was observed already after single doses in the dog. A dose 
dependent increase of C4 was observed in dog (3 to 7 times) and in rat (5 to 8 times) after the one month 
treatment period. 
 
The effects of A3309 on GI motility and feces output  were investigated in constipated beagle dogs. An 
increase in feces output was identified already at the lowest dose (1 mg/kg) tested and the magnitude of increase was similar to administration of tegaserod (0.3 mg/kg); a reference substance with known effects 
on GI motility in man. It was concluded that A3309 ameliorate meat-induced constipation in dogs.

Albireo  19(89) [ADDRESS_959569] observed was on 
renal function (decrease in urinary excretion of sodium and increase in urinary concentration of urea) and 
on gastrointestinal motility (decreased) after the highest d ose (350 mg/kg) given, which is more than 1000 
times higher than predicted dose in man. 
 
A3309 intravenously infused in the anesthetised dog at the doses of 0.0035, 0.035, 0.35, 3.5 mg/kg did not cause any pharmacologically relevant action on cardiovascula r parameters. The only 
statistically significant change was a slight decrease in mean coronary blood flow and increase in coronary resistance. However, in the absence of any other hemodynamic effects, even at plasma 
concentration of 10,000 nmol/L, the effe ct on coronary flow is considered to be of no biological 
significance.  
 In addition, no cardiovascular effects were observed in the three-month toxicity study in dog 
at doses up to 140 mg/kg (520 times a human dose of 20 mg). A3309 had low effect in vitro in a variety 
of tissue models, enzyme/binding assay and on the hERG potassium channel; IC50 > [ADDRESS_959570] on the intestinal bile acid absorption in mouse with an ED50 value of 0.3 mg/kg and a dose-dependent reduction (maximal effect 
38%) of plasma cholesterol in a transgenic mouse model showing a human- like lipoprotein profile.  
 
After oral administration of A3309,  a dose dependent increase in plasma of 7α -hydroxy-4- cholesten -3-
one (C4), a biomarker for bile acid synthesis, was observed in dog (3 to 7 times) and in rat (5 to 8 times).  
 
In a study of the effects of A3309 on feces output in a dog model of meat-induced constipation, animals 
were dosed orally once daily for 3 days at 1.5, 5, 15, or 50 μ mol/kg or   with tegaserod (a compound 
previously used to treat constipation in humans) at dose levels of  0.3, 1.0, 66 μ mol/kg.  A3309 
ameliorates meat-induced constipation in dogs already at the dose of 1.5 μ mol/kg, with  a statistically 
significant effect at a dose of 15 μmol/kg. Tegaserod also reversed con stipation in this dog model 
validating the method.The predicted therapeutic oral dose in man for A3309 is in the range of 5 mg to 20 
mg with a predicte d therapeutic target dose of approximately 10 -15 mg/day, calculated from in vitro 
potency in human IBAT transfected cells and the in vitro and in vivo potency in mouse,  dog, 
gastrointestinal effects on motility in healthy volunteers and in patients with chronic idiopathic 
constipation.

was detected in the blood in an autoradiography study in rats. The oral bi oavailability in the dog was only

 2%. Cmax is generally reached within 2 hours after oral administration to rat and dog and is eliminated 
from plasma with a half-life < 2 hours.  
 
A3309 is highly bound to plasma proteins, >99.5%. The tissue distribution of A3309- 14C    was limited 
after an oral dose, and the radioactivity was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_51678]; [ADDRESS_959572] doses in the toxicity studies, where the exposure increased more than dose proportional in the rat (AUC) while less than dose 
proportional in the dog.   
A3309 does not inhibit heterologously expressed human CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 up to 20 µM. 
It inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 exhibiting IC50 values of 10.3 and 6.0 µ M respectively. That the 
absorption of A3309 is low indicates a low risk of drug-drug interactions with these enzymes after oral dosing.  
 
8.6 Toxicology and Safety Pharmacology 
 
At the doses of A3309 in the safety studies (3.5-350 mg/kg) in the rat, no evidence was found for any 
biologically relevant effect on central nervous system and respi[INVESTIGATOR_706199], heart rate or body temperature. The only significant effect observed was on 
renal function (decrease in urinary excretion of sodium and increase in urinary concentration of urea) and 
on gastrointestinal motility (decreased) after the highest dose (350 mg/kg) given, which is more than 1000 times higher than a clinical dose of 20 mg. A3309 intravenously infused in the anesthetised dog at the 
doses of 0.0035, 0.035, 0.35 and 3.5 mg/kg did not cause any pharmacologically relevant action on 
cardiovascular parameters. The only statistically significant change was a slight decrease in mean 
coronary blood flow and increase in coronary resistance.  However, in the absence of any other 
hemodynamic effects, even at plasma concentration of 10,000 nmol/L, the effect on coronary flow is considered to be of no biological significance. 
 
The acute toxicity of A3309 is considered to be low after oral administration. The minimum lethal dose 
after oral adminis tration in rats and mice is >2000 mg/kg.  Dogs were given single oral ascending doses 
of A3309 at 8.4, 17, 35, 70 and 140 mg/kg. The animals were necropsied 14 days after completion of 
dosing.  Clinical signs observed after treatment were loose stool, diarrhea and emesis. The frequency and 
severity increased with dose starting at 17 mg/kg. There were no histopathology changes that could be 
attributed to A3309. 
 
In a preliminary rat study, enteritis of the caecum was observed in most animals dosed at 200 or 1000 
mg/kg for 7 days. However, the toxicological significance of this finding is unclear since rats dosed with 
up to 350 mg/kg/day of A3309 for one or three months showed no effects in the gastrointestinal tract.  
In both the one- and the three-month toxi city study in rats, groups of 10 males and 10 females were given 
A3309 orally once a day at 0, 3.5, 35 and 350 mg/kg for 28 days and 13 weeks respectively. None of the changes seen in A3309- treated rats were considered to be of toxicological significance. NOAEL (no 
observable adverse effect level) in rats was at least 350 mg/kg/day in both studies.  
 In a one-month toxicity study in dogs, groups of 3 males and 3 females were given A3309 orally once 
daily for 28 days at 0, 3.5, 17 and 140 mg/kg/day. The only blood chemistry change considered 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  21(89) 07 June 2010  
 noteworthy at these dose levels was a slightly reduced level of plasma triglycerides. For all other 
parameters, including histopathology, there were no toxicologically significant, treatment- related 
changes.  Based on the findings of emesis and soft/fluid feces at 17 and 140 mg/kg the NOAEL in dogs was considered to be 3.5 mg/kg/day. However, excluding these signs of mild gastrointestinal intolerance 
there were no effects of toxicological significance at doses up to and in cluding 140 mg/kg. 
In a three-month toxicity study in dogs, groups of 4 males and 4 females were given A3309 orally once 
daily for 13 weeks at 0, 3.5, 17.5 and 140 mg/kg/day. Dose related liquid feces were seen in all groups 
treated with A3309. An increase in liver weight and minor changes in red blood cell parameters at high 
dose was not considered toxicologically significant. NOAEL for males was 140 mg/kg/day but in females 
17.5 mg/kg/day based upon emesis occurring at the higher dose.  
Thus, the main target organ for A3309 in the toxicology studies appears to be the gastrointestinal tract. It 
is most likely that the effects seen in the gastrointestinal tract are related to the pharmacological activity 
of A3309, e.g. increased colon motility. Based on the available toxicological documentation, it is 
concluded that A3309 can be given orally to man up to three months of duration in the proposed clinical trials with sufficient safety.  
8.7 Reproductive Toxicology 
No adverse effects on fertility or embryo -fetal development were seen in the repro -toxicity studies in rat 
and rabbit. The doses of A3309 used exceeded a clinical dose of 20 mg by [CONTACT_2902] 600- 4000 fold. In a fertility and embryo-fetal study in rats, groups of 22 males and 22 female rats were given A3309 at 0, 
175, 350 or 1000 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks prior pairing and continued until day 17 (females) and day 20 
(males) of gestation. The NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day. In an embryo-fetal study in rabbits, groups of 24 
mated females were given daily oral doses of A3309 at 0, 20, 55 and 150 mg/kg/day from day 7 to day 19 
of gestation. The NOEL was 150 mg/kg/day.  
8.[ADDRESS_959573] been two  main studies to date in humans: a single and repeated -dose, single-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase I study to assess the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of 
A3309 after single escalating oral doses and repeated doses in healthy male subjects (D1240C00001)  
1. The single doses were 0.1, 0.5, 2.5 and 5 mg. The repeated dose was 0.25 mg daily for seven days. In 
total, 38 subjects were randomized; thirty subjects to single doses of A3309 or placebo and eight subjects 
to repeated doses or placebo. Tolerability was monitored by [CONTACT_706246], 12- lead ECGs, 
safety laboratory assessments and recordin g of adverse events. In addition, specific evaluation of 
gastrointestinal symptoms (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale – GSRS), bowel movement frequency 
and stool consistency were evaluated.  Pharmacodynamic markers of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_706200]/sitosterol, lanosterol and 7α -hydroxy-4- cholesten -3-one (C4). No effect on 
lipid profiles was noted. However, this is not expected after a single dose. There was an effect on C4 in 
the 2.5 and 5 mg single dose cohorts. Pharmaco kineti c samples were scheduled throughout the 24 hour 
observation period in the single dose groups. No measurable plasma or urine concentrations of A3309 were detected; neither in the single ascending dose part (up to and including 5 mg) or in the multiple dose 
group (0.25 mg daily for seven days). In 26 normal healthy volunteers, the adverse events observed were: 
flatulence (27 percent), abdominal distension (19 percent), abdominal pain (12 percent), and diarrhea, nausea and headache, (2 percent each). Adve rse events, other than gastrointestinal problems, were few and 
in most cases mild in intensity and did not cause any reason for concern. One 25 year old male developed bloating, passage of mucus and had proctitis on colonoscopy 6 weeks later. There were no  clinically 
relevant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, vital signs, weight, ECG, physical observations, GSRS, or stool appearance during the study.

 2. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase Ib, dose- escalating study to assess the safety, 
tolerability and systemic exposure of A3309 capsules after repeated once daily administration to patients 
with chronic idiopathic constipation (Study A3309-001). Eligible patients should have had at least a 12 
month history of constipation (defined as < 3 BMs per week) with symptoms and no more than 5 
spontaneous complete bowel movements ( SCBMs ) during the 14 days preceding randomization. The 
initial screening evaluation included flexible sigmoidoscopy, colon transit measurement and a 14 day 
period to evaluate frequency of BMs and to calculate baseline data for GI symptoms. The primary 
objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of A3309 after repeated oral doses to 
patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Secondary objectives of the study were to assess: 1/ 
changes in (SCBM) and Bristol Stool Form score after repeated oral doses of A3309, 2/ to investigate 
colon transit and systemic availability of A3309 during escalating oral repeated doses and 3/ to eval uate 
the effect of A3309 by [CONTACT_706247]1c, triglycerides (TG), plasma lipid parameters, 
FGF19, FGF21 and C4. Patients were randomized in a 5:1 ratio to receive one of five sequential dose 
levels (0.1 mg, 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg or 10 mg) of A3309 or placebo, orally administered. A blinded 
safety assessment was performed between each dose level.  The safety evaluation do not indicate any 
apparent effects on physical examination findings, vital signs, safety laboratory or 12- lead ECGs and no 
serious adverse events were reported.  In 25 constipation patients, the adverse events observed were: 
abdominal distension, nausea and headache (8 percent each) . The small number of subjects and events do 
not permit conclusions about any difference between groups in the nature, severity or incidence of adverse events. No deaths were reported and no adverse events led to treatment or study discontinuation. 
Pharmacokinetics: A3309 was detected in plasma in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_706201] 1-10 mg. The highes t 
individual levels at 10 mg were 0.33-0.76 nmol/L, seen 2 hours after 14 days of treatment. Cmax occurs 
within 4 h after dose. There is no obvious accumulation of neither A3309 or any metabolite since there 
were no detectable levels 24 hours after dose.  The pharmacodynamic analyses provided evidence of 
biological activity consistent with the mechanism of action of A3309: 
• C4, a biomarker of bile acid synthesis, showed a dose- dependent increase from baseline to end of 
treatment (p=0.0042). Values returned to baseline at the follow -up 30 days after end of treatment. 
• Total cholesterol showed a dose-dependent decrease from baseline to end of treatment (p=0.0305) 
and a similar trend was observed for LDL cholesterol (p=0.0536). 
• This study was not powered to show an effect on clinical endpoints, or a comparison to placebo.  
 
However, pre-planned as exploratory analyses, the following parameters indicate therapeutic effect with 
A3309: 
• Colon transit in Days comparing baseline with an evaluation on last day of treatmen t; p=0.0129 
(test for trend over increasing dose)  
• Change from Baseline to Week 1 for number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs); p= 
0.0285 (test for trend over increasing dose)  
• Most of the observed signals of clinical effect were identified in the 10 mg group.  
 
The overall conclusions from the dose levels tested:  
• Very low systemic exposure (pi[INVESTIGATOR_706202]) was observed.  
• Administration of A3309 was found to be safe and tolerable across the dose levels tested with no 
serious adverse events or discontinuations. 
• Clear biological effect  on C4, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and colon transit.  
• Preliminary descriptive evidence of clinical efficacy: bowel movement frequency.

10 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METH ODS    
 This is a randomized, single- center, parallel-group, dose-response, multiple-administration, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of A3309 on gastrointestinal and colonic transit in patients 
with functional constipation. Fol lowing an initial screening (visit 1 ), patients will have baseline transit 
measurement over 24 hours to ensure they fulfill entry criteria for transit.  Subsequently, they will  be 
randomized to one dose of A3309 or placebo per day for 14 days, and will undergo scintigraphic 
assessment of gastric, small bowel and colonic transit of solids starting on day 12.  These studies will be 
undertaken on over a 48 hour period, days 12 to 14, (visit s 4-6). Participants will undergo a safety follow-
up visit (visit 7) 7-[ADDRESS_959575] day of study medication. Three treatment arms will be included in 
the study.  As stated above, participants will be randomly assigned and allocation will be concealed.

2. The clinical population potentially receiving A3309 as  a treatment f or functional constipation is  
mostly female.  
3. This is a non -therapeutic study; therefore, we are not depriving males of a potential therapy for 
functional constipation.  
 
It is anticipated that the racial/ethnic characteristics of the group will reflect the communities in Olmsted County, Minnesota and are anticipated  to be 90% Caucasian, 5% Asian and 5% other minorities.  The 
prevalence of IBS among whites, blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. is very similar.  
There are no known ethnic or gender differences in bioavailability of A3309.  Hence, we anticipate the 
results o f our study will be generalizable.

19.[ADDRESS_959594] on the bio marker C4, data on colon transit, and results of patient-reported outcomes 
in study A3309-001, the protocol design includes two dose levels: 15 and 20 mg.  
 
These dose estimations are based on the following findings from preclinical studies:  
• PD effects of A3309 tested in several species in both in vitro  and in vivo experiments.  The in 
vitro  potency in human IBAT- transfected cells, as well as the in vitro  and in vivo  potency in the 
mouse and the dog were used to approximate an effective dose in humans from 0.25 to 0.5 
µmol/kg. 
• A dose of A3309 0.16 µ mol/kg resulted in twice the fecal excretion of 75
• Evaluation of the results of the A3309-001 study showed: SeHCAT in the mouse 
than in humans over a 24-hour period; mouse IBAT showed a 3-fold greater potency than human 
IBAT.  In the dog, a clear increase of C4 and in di arrhea was observed and a reversal of meat-
induced constipation was detected at 5  µmol/kg (the canine IBAT has a 10-fold less potency than 
human IBAT).  As diarrhea was observed in the dog at 5 µmol/kg in the 3 month toxicology 
study, this dose is probably too high for use in patients with constipation. 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  32(89) 07 June 2010  
 o A minor signal on C4 and on lipid parameters observed at the 3 mg and the 10 mg dose levels 
produced a stronger signal; 
o Efficacy signals (colon transit, stool form scale ( 28), and frequency of BMs) evident in the 10 
mg dose group.  However, no diarrhea or incapacitating “very loose stools” were observed in the 10 mg dose group. 
Given the paucity of data, the therapeutic oral dose range in man is difficult to estimate but  may be in the 
range of 5 to 20 mg, as calculated from in vitro  potency in human IBAT- transfected cells and from in 
vitro  and in vivo  potency in the mouse, dog, and man.  
 
Previous experience with A3309 does not include dose levels greater than 10 mg.  Evaluating  15 mg and 
a 20 mg dose level is adequate given:  
• The large safety window in the preclinical toxicology package.  The only dose- limiting effect 
identified was emesis in female dogs given high dose.  The preliminary NOAEL in
 the rat was 
350 mg/kg, 140 mg/kg in the male dog, and 17.5 mg/kg in the female dog, giving an  approximate 
safety margins of approximately 520 to 1300-fold differences for a 20 mg dose (see Section 
1.2.6). 
• The extremely low systemi c exposure (pi[INVESTIGATOR_706208]) of both A3309 and its metabolites   
• The high protein binding (approximately 99.5 %), and  
• The benign safety profile in the Phase Ib study  
The available toxicological documentation indicates that A3309 can be given orally to humans for up to 3 
months duration at doses of 15 mg and potentially within the range of 1 to 20 mg for up to 90 days.  In 
parallel with this study a Phase IIb study (A3309-002) is ongoing in the US including three dose levels (5, 
10 and 15 mg) and with a treatment duration of [ADDRESS_959595] of IP administered to the patients.

drawn from an IV line into a lavender EDTA collection tube, centrifuged at  3000 rpm for 15 minutes and 
the plasma transferred to a n anonymized polypropylene tube labeled only with a study number and patient 
initials as identifiers.  The samples will be frozen at - 70 degrees Celsius until they are batch shipped to 
Covance [LOCATION_006]  for analysis after the end of the study. One 5 -mL pharmacodynamic sample to determine 
levels of C4 is  taken at Visit 1, 4 and 7 and stored in the refrigerator for 30- 60 min and thereafter serum is 
separated by [CONTACT_7891].  The serum obtained is aliquoted into a cryo tube equipped with a screw- cap 
lid with a rubber o-ring.  Samples are thereafter frozen at -70 degrees Celsius until they are batch shipped 
to Karolinska Institue, Sweden for analysis after end of the study . The total amount of blood drawn for 
these pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic samples is about 75 mL .

respectively. The laboratory analysis will be performed at Mayo Clinic. 
21.4 Clinical safety assessments 
A physical exa mination will be performed at the Visit 1  study entry and Visit 7 study completion and if 
necessary throughout the study. 
Vital signs (including temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be recorded at all  visit s.  
Patients will be inte rviewed about adverse events and concomitant medications at every visit.   
 
[ADDRESS_959602] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including e.g. an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the product.  Adverse Events (AE)  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8686] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is regarded as medically important  without meeting the above mentioned criteria.  
 
The term life -threatening in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk 
of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it was more severe.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706209]. Note however that the subject mus t be formally 
admitted. Waiting in outpatient clinic or emergency room would not count. A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706210], nor does staying in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119817] (e.g. respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], the fact that there is no -
one at home to care for the patient).  
 
Any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current 
Investigator Brochure (IB); or, if an IB is not required or available, the specificity or severity of which is 
not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application, as amended.  Unexpected Adverse Drug experience  
 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  36(89) 07 June 2010  
 Mild means awareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable)  Intensity  
Moderate means discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity (disturbing)  
Severe  means incapacity to work or to do usual activity (unacceptable)  
 
Certain - A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time 
relationship to drug administration, and which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19010]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The 
event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.  Causality  
Probable - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a reasonable time sequence to 
use of the product, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not 
required.  
Possible - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a reasonable time sequence to  
use of the product, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Unlikely - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a temporal relationship with use 
of the product which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
 Not related - Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre -existing 
condition, unde rlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).  
An adverse event will be considered associated with the use of a study drug if the attribution is certain, 
probable or possible.  
22.2 Evaluations  
All AEs, serious and non-serious, should be recorded in the CRF. If no AE has occurred during the study period, this should also be recorded in the CRF.  
The following evaluations are to be done by [CONTACT_706258]: 
• type of event 
• seriousness  
• degree of severity  
• duration (start - end) 
• action taken  
• causality with study product 
• outcome of the adverse event  
For AE reporting purposes no distinction should be made between the IP  and any reference/comparator 
product. 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  37(89) [ADDRESS_959603] learns of it. The Initial Repor t 
should contain as a minimum the following information: 
• subject identification  
• treatment specification  
• adverse event diagnosis  
• time specification for the medical event  
• name [CONTACT_706305]  
 
A Serious Adverse Event Report Form must also be completed, signed by [CONTACT_706259]. Apart from the 
information above, this Follow-up Report should also contain the following information: 
• assessment of severity  
• assessment of causality  
No distinction should be made between the IP  and the reference product regarding reporting of SAEs as 
long as the code is not broken.  
SAEs should be reported to the CRO Icon  even after the clinical study has been finished, if, in the 
judgment of the Investigator, there might be an association between the event and the previous use of the 
study product(s) or as a result of the study procedures. This post -study observation period will be up to [ADDRESS_959604].  
An SAE may qualify for reporting to the FDA by [CONTACT_13679]’s representative if the AE is both serious and unexpected based upon the current Investigator’s Brochure.  In this case, all 
Investigators will receive a formal notification describing the SAE in the form of an IND safety report.

contraceptive medication. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive 
termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even after the 
patient  was discontinued from the study. 
All events of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be repor ted and handled as AEs. All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to the CRO Icon  on the 
pregnancy outcomes report form.

23 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
23.1 Monitoring and auditing procedures  
The study site will be visited by [CONTACT_349219]/or the Project Manager  periodically at times agreed on 
by [CONTACT_706260]. It is the function of the Monitor to ascertain that all aspects of the 
Study Protocol are complied with and that the conduct of the study conforms to applicable regulatory 
requirements  and established  rules for Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ).  
At the time of each monitoring visit, the Monitor will review the completed CRFs to ascertain that all 
items have been completed and that the data provided are accurate and obtained in the manner specified 
in the p rotocol.  
The Monitor will also check that the data in the CRF are consistent with the clinical records (Source Data 
Verification) and that study results are recorded completely and correctly . The Monitor will check on the 
reporting of SAEs  and the procedures for IP accountability and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. For this purpose the 
Monitor must  be given direct access to clinical records, original laboratory data, etc., as far as these relate 
to the study and without jeopardizing subject integrity. CRFs for all include d subjects must be made 
available to the Monitor for review.  
The study site may also be subject to quality assurance audit by [CONTACT_706261]. A Regulatory Authority may request to make an inspection of the st udy site. The 
procedures of such a visit would be similar to those of a monitoring visit, and data already checked by [CONTACT_706262]. The Investigator is required to inform the Sponsor immediately of an 
inspection requested by a Regulatory Authority.

All Investigators and staff carrying out observations of primary or other major efficacy variables involved 
in the study should provide a Curriculum V itae (CV). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a list of all personnel involved in 
the study together with their f unction and study related duties delegated. He/she will ensure that 
appropriate study related training is given to all of these staff, and that any new information of relevance 
to the performance of this study is forwarded to the staff involved. 
Before inclusion of subjects the Monitor  and/or Project Manager  will perform a study initiation visit to 
inform and train relevant study staff.  
24 STATISTICAL METHODS  
24.1 Statistical c onsiderations 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare transit parameters  and patient bowel 
pattern diary summaries ( i.e., stool frequency, mean stool consistency and mean ease of passage scores ) 
among the treatment groups. The covariates considered for inclusion in the analyses are age, body mass index (BMI) and the corresponding baseline (pre -treatment) bowel pattern diary summaries. If necessary  
a suitable transformation for potential skewness in the distributions of measured responses or 
heterogenous variation amongst the treatment groups may be used ( i.e., ANCOVA on ranks  or square root 
transformed stool frequency . 
 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  40(89) [ADDRESS_959610] for overall treatment effec ts for a given response has a p value less than or equal to 
0.10, then both the 15 mg and 20 mg doses will be compared to placebo using  Dunnett’s Test .  
 Since each  of the primary endpoints assesses a separate hypothesis regarding the effects of  A3309, no 
adjustment in the alpha level for testing multiple types of endpoints is anticipated, and a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05 will be used in each ANCOVA model.  
24.2 Analysis data sets  
The primary analyses will follow the intent to treat (ITT) paradigm with all patients randomized included 
in the analyses. Those patients with missing response values will have their missing values imputed via 
the overall (patients  with non-missing data) mean and a corresponding adjustment in the ANCOVA 
residual error variance degrees of freedom (subtracting one for each missing value imputed).  A per 
protocol analysis of transit data will also be performed. The per protocol population c onsists of all 
patients having at least 80 % compliance with study drug and having participated in the transit evaluation. 
Safety data will be presented for all patients receiving investigational product.  
24.3 Demographics  
The following baseline values and pat ient characteristics will be summarized descriptively in order to 
describe the study population: age, gender and ethnic origin .  
24.4 Analysis of efficacy

Albireo  41(89) 07 June 2010  
 the colon at 6 hours will also be estimated as a measure of orocecal (and a surrogate for 
small bowel) transit.  
2. Geometric center of colonic counts for solids at 4, 24 and 48 hours will be estimated using 
geometric mean of counts in ascending, transverse, descending and rectosigmoid colon and 
stool (weighted by [CONTACT_470438] 1 to 5 respectively). The primary variable of interest in overall 
colonic transit is the geometric center at 24 hours.   
3. Ascending colon emptying t1/[ADDRESS_959614] day of transit measurement and the 24 h data.  
The primary summaries obtained for comparison of transit profiles will be the  colonic geometric center at 24 hours and the ascending colon emptying t½.  The geometric cen ter is the weighted 
average of counts in the different colonic regions: ascending (AC), transverse (TC), descending (DC), rectosigmoid (RS), and stool.  At any time, the portion of colonic counts in each colonic region is 
multiplied by [CONTACT_706264] s as follows: (%AC x 1 + %TC x 2 + %DC x 3 + %RS x 4 + %stool 
x 5)/100 = geometric center. Thus, a high geometric center implies faster colonic transit.  A geometric 
center of 1 implies that all isotope is in the ascending colon and a geometric center of 5 implies that 
all isotope is in the stool. The t½ of ascending colon emptying is also estimated by [CONTACT_706265] -time curve for percent residing in the ascending colon; linear interpolation is used to connect 
points. 
24.6 Stool frequency and stool consi stency  
Patients  are asked to keep a daily  bowel pattern diary  documenting the number of stools and the 
consistency (Bristol Stool Scale  (28)) of each stool. These are averaged  as number of bowel movements 
or consistency of bowel movements per day per patient . Number of bowel movements and consistency 
are subsequently averaged over the study periods (i.e. run-in and treatment) per patient . The ANCOVA 
will be used to assess treatment effects on each of these two measures sepa rately, using the corresponding 
run-in values as covariates.  In addition, treatment effects on specific constipation symptoms , considered 
as discrete categorical responses, will be evaluated by a contingency table analysis of the post -treatment 
responses based on the final post -treatment bowel pattern diaries and questionnaires concerning 
constipation symptoms and treatment efficacy.

 24.9 Assessment  of sample size  
Table 1 below summarizes data for the primary response measures and uses the (relative) variation, 
(CV%) to estimate the effect size detectable with 80% power based on a two sample t -test  at a two -sided 
alpha level of 0.05. The effect size is the difference in group means as a percentage of the overall mean for each response and assumes 12 subjects per group. The ANCOVA should provide 80% power to detect 
similar (pairwise) differences using a pooled estimate of variation across all three  groups and potentially 
even smaller effect sizes b y adjusting
 for important covariates. The data from the scintigraphic transit  
studies are based on the same methods proposed for this study . There is no  planned adjustment for 
dropouts. In these types of studies, we expect less than five percent dropouts.   Missing data will be 
handled by [CONTACT_706267] (e.g. use of mean data for all participants for that specific 
missing data), with appropriate adjustment of the degrees of freedom for each data imputed.

2. What Will Happen To You While You Are In 
This Research Study? 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  53(89) [ADDRESS_959630] up to about forty-one (41) days from the date of the first visit, but the actual testing 
will be done ov er five (5) days on two (2) separate occasions in the Charlton 7 Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU).   
 
If you agree to be in the study, you will be asked to participate in the following activities:  
 
Visit 1 – You will be asked to report to the Charlton 7 CRU f asting for the previous eight (8) hours, no 
food or drink allowed. You will be asked to review and sign an informed consent form. You will have an interview with and a brief physical examination performed by a study physician. If you have not had a 
normal rectal exam to rule out a possible evacuation disorder documented within the past two (2) years, 
this exam will be performed at this time. You will have your height, weight and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_149939]) measured.  You will be asked to have an electrocardiogram 
(ECG), a recording of the heart rhythm, performed. Blood and urine samples will be obtained to perform 
standard laboratory safety tests including hematology, chemistry , coagulation studies, urinalysis, urine 
screen for drugs of abuse and a urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential.  You will be 
told the results of the pregnancy test. If it is positive, you will not be able to take part in the study  Note 
that females who are status post bilatera l tubal ligation, hysterectomy or postmenopausal  do not need this 
test. Blood samples will also be obtained for pharmacodynamics (C4, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and 
triglycerides) and one solitary pharmacokinetic sample. The total volume of blood obtained for the 
standard laboratory tests is about two tablespoons.
 You will be asked to complete one (1) questionnaire, 
the long Bowel Disease questionnaire (BDQ) to confirm the diagnosis of constipation. This questionnaire requires about ten (10) to twenty (20) minutes total to complete. You will be given a bowel pattern diary and instructed in its completion. You will record numbers in this bowel pattern diary beginning today 
through Visit 7, the final day of the study for a maximum of 41 days. This visit will require approximately 
45 to 75 minutes total. 
 
During the study, you will be asked to refrain from donating blood; participating in other research studies or taking any additional over-the-counter or prescription medications or herbal supplements that hav e not 
been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_706276]. 
 
Prior to Visit [ADDRESS_959631] a urine sample at Desk Charlton 7 CRU the day prior to Visit 2 or bring in a sample 
with you should Visit 2 fall on a Monday. 
 
 
Visit 2  – Within 7 -14 days of Visit 1, you will be asked to return to Charlton 7 CRU fasting for the 
previous eight (8) hours, no food or drink allowed, to have your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_149939]) measured . You will be given a capsule containing a small amount of 
radioactivity. This allows the movement of food particles through the colon to be measured using an 
external camera.  You will be asked not to eat anything for the next two (2) hours and to return four (4) 
hours later for one five (5) minute camera pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].  You will be asked to return the following morning at 
the same time you took the capsule for another five (5) minute camera image.  If the camera  indicates a 
state of constipation, you will continue in the study  and receive the study medication.  If the camera does 
not indicate a state of c onstipation, the study will be ended at this time.  
 
Visit 3  – You will be asked to return to Charlton 7 CRU fasting for the previous eight (8) hours, no food 
or drink allowed, to have your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_706217]) 
Version 1.3  Clinical Study Protocol A3309-003 
 
 
Albireo  54(89) 07 June 2010  
 measured. You will be complete a six (6) question survey of constipation symptoms and treatment 
effectiveness before you receive the study medication.  This survey will require less than five (5) minutes. 
You will be assigned to the study medication wh ich is either a placebo (an inactive substance) or a 15 mg 
or 20 mg dose of A3309 study medication taken orally once daily for a total of fourteen (14) consecutive days, eleven (11) doses at home and three (3) at the Charlton CRU during the final transit s cintigraphy 
test, Visit 4 to Visit 6.  You will be put into one of these three (3) groups by [CONTACT_3364] (as in the flip of a 
coin). There is a two in three (2/3) chance that you would receive the A3309 study medication and a one 
in three (1/3) chance you would receive placebo. Neither you nor the research team will know what study 
medication you receive. However, in case of emergency, the physician would be able to find out.  This 
study will require about fifteen minutes total.  
 
Prior to Visit [ADDRESS_959632] a urine sample at Desk Charlton 7 CRU the day prior to Visit 2 or bring in a sample with you should Visit 2 fall on a Monday. 
 
Visit 4  - You will be asked to return to Charlton 7 CRU fasting for the previous eight (8) hours, no food 
or drink allowed, to have your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_149939]) measured. A [ADDRESS_959633] meal; the eggs also contain a small amount of radioactivity. Images will be obtained 
immediately after the eg g breakfast; this image is considered the start of the imaging procedure or the 
‘zero hour’ image. Images will be obtained at 30, 60 and 90 minutes later and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after the ‘zero hour’ image. An intravenous line (a small sterile plastic catheter) will be placed in your forearm or hand to obtain small volume blood samples for pharmacokinetic (pk) analysis (the 
amount of study medication present in the blood sample). Small volume blood samples will be drawn 
immediately before the administration of the study medication and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, [ADDRESS_959634] laboratory safety tests including hematology, c hemistry , coagulation studies, 
and a urinalysis.  Blood samples will also be obtained for pharmacodynamics (C4, total cholesterol, LDL, 
HDL, and triglycerides) at this time. The total amount of blood taken will be about five  (5) tablespoons.  
About f our (4)  hours after the breakfast, you will eat a standard chicken breast  lunch meal . You will have 
camera images taken at five (5),  six (6) and seven (7) hours. You will eat a standard roast beef sandwich  
snack , about eight (8) hours after the
 breakfast followe d by a final camera image. These standard meals 
are not radioactive, they are supplied only so all participants in this study eat the same type and same amount of food this day. You will be asked not to eat or drink anything while you are having the transi t 
test performed today other than what you are given. After the eight (8) hour image is completed, you will 
be instructed to return to the Charlton 7 CRU at specific times on the following two (2) mornings for 
administration of study medication and to obta in one five (5) minute camera image. This visit will require 
about nine to ten (9 to 10) hours total.  
 
 
Visit 5  – The following morning , you will be asked to return to the Charlton 7 CRU fasting for the 
previous eight (8) hours, no food or drink allowed. You will receive the study medication and one five (5) 
minute camera image will be obtained. This visit will require fifteen (15) to twenty -five (25) minutes 
total.

 Pregnancy and Birth Control:  
1) Will women of child- bearing -potential be allowed to participate in this study ? 
Yes:  Women of child-bearing-potential will be able to participate in this study if they have a 
negative pregnancy test and agree to use acceptable birth control (see # 4) since the risks to an 
unborn child are either unknown or potentially serious. 
 
2)   Will pregnant and/or nursing women be allowed to participate in this study?   
      No :  There is not enough medical information to know what the risks might be to    an unborn 
child carried by a woman who takes part in this study. 
 3)   Do you need to ha ve a pregnancy test done to be part of the study?   
      Yes : As part of this study a pregnancy test is required for all women who are able   to become 
pregnant. A urine pregnancy test will be done. You will be told the results of the pregnancy test.  If the pregnancy test is positive, you will not be able to take part in the study. 
 
4)  What types of birth control are acceptable?  
Surgical sterilization  
Approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], Depo- Provera)  
Barrier methods (such as a  condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide 
An intrauterine device (IUD) Abstinence 
 
Risk summary  
Many side effects go away shortly after the A3309 study medication is stopped, but in some cases side 
effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.  Some side effects may not be known.  Side 
effects may range from mild to life- threatening. Other drugs may be given to make side effects less 
serious and less uncomfortable.  Talk to the researcher and/or your healthcare provider about side effects and ask any other questions.

will be done in a way that does not directly identify you.  
 
This information may be given to other researchers in this study, representatives of the company 
sponsoring the study, Albireo, including representatives in the [LOCATION_003] or other countries, or private, state or 
federal government parties or regulatory authorities in the [LOCATION_003] and other countries responsible for overseeing this research.  These may include the Food and Drug Administration, the Office for Human 
Research Pr otections, or other offices within the Department of Health and Human Services, and the 
Mayo Clinic Office for Human Research Protections or other Mayo groups involved in protecting 
research subjects.  
 
Information Disclosed to Study Sponsor 
The study data sent by [CONTACT_706279], address, social 
security number, or other information that directly identifies you.  Instead, the study doctor assigns a code

Albireo  59(89) 07 June 2010  
 number to the study data and may use your initials.  Some study data sent to the sponsor may contain 
information that could be used (perhaps in combination with other information) to identify you (eg, date 
of birth). If you have questions about the specific health information that will be sent to the sponsor, you 
should ask the study doctor. 
 
If this information is given out to anyone outside of Mayo, the information may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_706280].  However, Mayo will  take steps to help other parties understand the need to keep this information 
confidential.  
This authorization lasts until the end of the study. The study does not end until all data has been collected, 
checked (or audited) and analyzed.  Sometimes this can be years after your study visits have ended.  For example, this could happen if the results of the study are filed with a regulatory agency like the Food and 
Drug Administration

Privacy  
What Other Things Might the Sponsor do with Study Data?  
In addition to the uses listed above, companies that sponsor studies often use study data for other 
purposes that are not part of the study.  For example, the company might use the study data for research 
purposes to support the scientific objectives of the study described in this consent document, to learn 
more about the effects (good and bad) of any drug, device or treatment included in the study, to better understand the disease(s) included in the study, or to improve the design of future studies.  Also, the 
company might share the study data with other companies it does business with.  The company might do 
these  things during the study, or after the study has ended, and would not have to ask for your permission 
to do so.  The sponsor might still use study data, even after you stop your authorization, or the authorization expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], as long as the study data was collected before your authorization stopped or expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697].  The ways in which the study data could be used in the future may not be known now, so we 
can’t give you the details.  
 
13. What Will Happen to Your Samples? 
 
Your samples obtained for pharmacokinetic measurements and for evaluation of biological effects of the drug will be sent to the sponsor or the sponsor’s designee.  The sponsor can use your samples solely for 
research purposes as described in the research study.  Your sample will be returned to Mayo o r destroyed

Albireo  60(89) [ADDRESS_959639] safety assessments (chemistry, hematology, coagulation studies, 
urinalysis and urine screen for drugs of abuse) will be used as described for this study.  When the study is 
done, they will be destroyed.

[INVESTIGATOR_706222]/or funding source for specific grading scales. Suggested guidelines for the grading of AEs are available below: 
         
Identify the scale used to grade the severity of adve rse events in this study:  
 
 AEs will be graded according to CTEP Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC II)  
 AEs will be graded according to CTEP Common Terminology Criteria (CTC III)  
 AEs will be graded accordin g to the 0 -5 scale shown above  
X AEs will be graded using another system (specify):  
 
AEs will be graded as per protocol (page 33) : Mild means awareness of symptoms or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable)  
Moderate means discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity (disturbing)  Example 1:   Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC II) 
available for viewing at http://ctep.info.nih.govi  (see “Reporting Guidelines, Common 
Toxicity Criteria”)

 Severe  means incapacity to work or to do usual activity (unacceptable)  
 
Identify the attribution scale to be used in this study: 
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_706223]/devic e/agent as 
definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unrelated, or unknown. 
X  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_706224] (specify):  
 
AEs will be attributed as per protocol (page 33): 
Certain - A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality,  occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to drug administration, and which cannot be explained 
by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The eve nt must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
Probable - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a 
reasonable time sequence to use of the product, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is  not 
required.  
Possible - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a 
reasonable time sequence to  use of the product, but which could also be explained 
by [CONTACT_9153]. Information on drug 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a 
temporal relationship with use of the product which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not related - A clinical event - including laboratory test abnormality - with a 
temporal relationship with use of the product which makes a causal relationship impossible, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide a 
more probable explanations.  
 
Step 3: Implementing the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
 
A. Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
B. Refer to the Mayo Institutional Review Board (IRB) web site for guidelines on reporting adverse events at ( http://researchweb.mayo.edu/irb/index.html  ).  Please

 X   Sponsor (specify): Albireo  
 
 
C. Subject withdrawals/dropouts 
 
Describe how subject withdrawals/dropouts prior to study completion will be accommodated and reported. Include examples of reasons that may prompt subject withdrawal/dropout. 
Description: Patient withdrawals or discontinuatio ns prior to study completion will be described in an 
annual report to Mayo’s IRB and copi[INVESTIGATOR_706225], FDA and sponsor. Reasons for withdrawal include 
abnormal laboratory test result, concomitant illness or withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_4676].  
 
D. Decision mak ing criteria – Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706226] -making regarding continuation, modification, or 
termination of the clinical study (e.g. Review summarized data to determine response to procedure after 10% of subjects have been seen). 
Descripti on: A patient will be withdrawn from the study if she develops diarrhea severe enough to 
require IV rehydration. The study will be discontinued if greater than 40 percent of patients develop 
diarrhea severe enough to require IV rehydration. 
 
E. Study meeting s/discussions 
 
Identify method for documenting study discussions and meeting minutes, as well as 
follow-up communications.  
Method: Decisions that alter the study procedures or the human studies aspects will be communicated to 
the IRB, CRU and sponsor and the review minutes will be documented in the regulatory binder.  
 
Please note:  
All DSMP’s are subject to ongoing review and modification as new information concerning data integrity and safety issues become available. Proposals for revision of DSMP’s may c ome from any source, including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966], the study coordinator, 
CRU nursing staff, or the CTSA – Research Resources Program Director. Revisions of the DSMP may be expedited per the decision of the Program Director or the Research Resources Revie w Panel (RRRP) Chair but requires approval by [CONTACT_706291].

induce propulsive contractions in canine [>20mM ( 13)] and human colon [1mM or 5mM ( 15)]. In 
humans, there is a relationship between the fecal bile acid excretion and colonic motility; however, this relationship is complicat ed by [CONTACT_706294] ( 16). Bile acid concentration in stool of 
patients with ileal resection may reach 21mM chenodeoxycholate [CDC ( 17)].  However, fecal 
concentrations of bile acids in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS- D) or 
functional diarrhea are unknown, and up -regulation of the ileal active transporter ( 18) as a result

induce propulsive contractions in canine [>20mM ( 13)] and human colon [1mM ( 14) or 5mM 
(15)]. In humans, there is a relationship between the fecal bile acid excretion and colonic motility; 
however, this relationship is complicated by [CONTACT_706240] (15) since the delivery of fatty 
acids to the colon may also accelerate colonic transit ( 16). Bile acid concentration in stool of 
patients with ileal r esection may reach 21mM chenodeoxycholate [CDC ( 17)].  However, fecal 
concentrations of bile acids in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS- D) or

Bile acids are mainly absorbed by a specific ileal bile acid transporter in the ileum (IBAT) and 
are returned to the liver, completing enterohepatic circulation (1).  A3 309 is a small molecule 
known to be an inhibitor of the IBAT that interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by 
[CONTACT_706296], which results in an increased bile acid load to the 
colon.  This stimulates increased fluid secretion in the colon and colonic motility; both effects are 
expected to benefit patients with constipation (2).  Additionally, given the mode of action of A3309, beneficial effects on bile acid synthesis and cholesterol levels are anticipated  (2,3) . Bile 
acid reabsorption from the intestine is a very efficient process whereby 95% of the secreted bile 
acids are reabsorbed and IBAT, an integral brush border membrane glycoprotein that 
co-transports sodium and bile acid, appears to be a major regulator of the bile acid pool in 
animals and man. IBAT inhibitors prevent the reabsorption of bile acids from the ileum and their return to the liver.  The liver compensates for this decrease in bile acid level by [CONTACT_706297] 7 α-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis( 4,5).

Visit 4  - You will be asked to return to Charlton 7 CRU fasting for the previous eight (8) hours, 
no food or drink allowed, to have your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_427671]) measured. A [ADDRESS_959682] meal; the eggs also contain a small 
amount of radioactivity. Images will be obtained immediately after the egg breakfast; this image is considered the start of the imaging procedure or the ‘zero hour’ image. Images will be obtained

 at 30, 60 and 90 minutes later and at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after the ‘zero hour’ image. An 
intravenous line (a small sterile plastic catheter) will be placed in your forearm or hand to obtain 
small volume blood samples for pharmacokinetic (pk) analysis ( the amount of study medication 
present in the blood sample). Small volume blood samples will be drawn immediately before the 
administration of the study medication and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, [ADDRESS_959683] laboratory safety tests including hematology, chemistry , coagulation studies, 
and a urinalysis.  Blood samples will also be obtained for pharmacodynamics (C4, total 
cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides)  at this time. The total amount of blood taken will be 
about five (5) tablespoons.   Four (4) hours after the breakfast, you will eat a standard lunch meal 
consisting of chicken breast , baked potato, and vanilla pudding. You will  have camera images 
taken at five (5),  six (6) and seven (7) hours and eat a standard dinner of a roast beef sandwich , 
sugar cookie and milk eight (8) hours after the
 breakfast followed by a final camera image. These 
standard meals are not radioactive, they are supplied only so all participants in this study eat the same type and same amount of food this day. You will be asked not to eat or drink anything while 
you are having the transit test performed today other than what you are given. After the eight ( 8) 
hour image is completed, you will be instructed to return to the Charlton 7 CRU at specific times 
on the following two (2) mornings for administration of study medication and to obtain one five 
(5) minute camera image. This visit will require about nine to ten (9 to 10) hours total.

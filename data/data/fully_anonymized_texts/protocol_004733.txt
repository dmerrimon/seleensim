 APPENDIX A: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND PROCEDURES .........................[ADDRESS_521154] month opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724].  1 Age adjusted rates for overdose among women in the 
US increased more than six -fold from 1.4 in 1999 to 8.5 in 2016.2 Examining Pennsylvania (PA) 
and Utah (UT; the states where recruitment will happen in this study), these states have some of the highest rates of overdose among women compared to other US states.
2 Specifically, PA’s 
overdose rate among women surpassed the national average in 2016, and rates of overdose death in UT among women have ranged 2- [ADDRESS_521155] in the nation (41.6%).3 Prenatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) 
in the US has brought serious health consequences for mother and infant —including preterm 
delivery, low birth weight, NAS , and poor breastfeeding, and includes substantial expenditures of 
health care resourcs.4-9 Chances for  HIV (OR=20.3, 95% CI = 13.8 –29.7) and HCV  (OR=150.2. 
95% CI = 120.9–186.6) infection among women  with OUD  are markedly  higher than for those 
without OUD.[ADDRESS_521156] high rates of psychiatric illnesses,11,12 such as 
depression and anxiety,12-16 and other substance use disorders  (SUDs) ,14,16,17 with particularly 
high rates of smoking (>80%).10,14,17 Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), an opi[INVESTIGATOR_413478], has also increased substantially from 3.4/1000 births in 2009 to 
5.8/[ADDRESS_521157] financial and housing instability,16 challenges related to employment, and 
involvement with the legal system.29,30 These data call for rapid and targeted primary prevention 
activities aimed at assisting pregnant women with OUD to become linked to and retained in treatment in order to reduce harms to them (including overdose) and their offspring.  This project 
will expand our preliminary research of a novel patient navigation (PN) intervention designed to 
link and retain pregnant women with OUD in treatment (including MAT) and improve the health and wellbeing of mother and infant.  
31  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_413479] a Treatable Chronic Condition  
The National Institute on Drug Abuse defines  addiction as a chronic disease that can be managed 
and treated successfully with appropriate care.32 OUD among pregnant women is no exception 
and is a serious chronic health condition characterized by [CONTACT_413551]- term treatment and 
retention efforts. Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related OUD treatment admissions among pregnant women 
increased in the US from 2% in 1992 to 28% in 2012.33 In the US, the majority of illicit and 
medication- related OUD treatment admissions among women in 2012 were for pregnant 
compared to non- pregnant women.1 It is unfortunate that approximately 34% of pregnant women 
who enroll do not complete OUD treatment, with the majority leaving against medical advice 
(58%), being terminated early by [CONTACT_68811] (20%), being incarcerated (5%), or dying (1%).33 
2 
 Rates of relapse for mothers with OUD (in and outside of treatment) in the postpartum period who 
have achieved abstinence during pregnancy period have been noted to be as high as 80%.34,35 
Such relapse events following periods of abstinence are potentially fatal if individuals with 
decreased tolerance to opi[INVESTIGATOR_413480]- engage in opi[INVESTIGATOR_413481]- abstinence quantities.36-
38  
Altogether, OUD is a serious chronic health condition, and pregnant women with OUD are at high 
risk for a number of comorbid medical, behavioral, and psychosocial problems that require 
concerted efforts —including linking and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_413482]. Fortunately, pregnancy has been observed to be 
an optimal time for behavior change among women.39-[ADDRESS_521158] largely been developed and 
implemented in a fragmented fashion, resulting in limited outcomes. These components of care 
fall into two general areas: pharmacological  and integrated/comprehensive care.   
Pharmacological treatment is successful but addresses only one aspect of the chronic 
condition. The dominant method of care for pregnant women with OUD is medication assisted 
treatment (MAT), specifically methadone and buprenorphine treatment.52 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_413483].53 Managing opi[INVESTIGATOR_413484]. Preventing relapse is summarily important due to the serious health risks associated with illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], such as infectious diseases 
transmission (HIV/HCV) and overdose.
5,[ADDRESS_521159] strengths and limitations.
52,58 The focus of this study will be to help patients 
engage in either form of MAT, following the woman’s preference,  given benefits for mother and 
infant.  
Integrated and comprehensive care models are valuable but have limitations. To address t
he multiple and complex issues confronting pregnant women with OUD, integrated and 
comprehensive care models have been developed, tested, and have moved the field closer 
towards chronic condition management. Integrated care models  for pregnant women with OUD 
are predominantly comprised of multidisciplinary teams providing care16,59 or outpatient SUD 
services delivered within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]/clinics where pregnant women receive healthcare services60-
62 (i.e., co -located behavioral health models). Results of these models have yielded health 
improvements for infants  born to pregnant women with OUD.60-62 However, these models exclude 
important needs of pregnant women with OUD; such as mental health services, housing, food 
security, and poly -substance use. These models also lack methods for providers to promote self -
management and use of resources critical  to mothers’ health and infant psychosocial 
development.  
[ADDRESS_521160] been utilized among drug dependent 
women to provide a more complete spectrum of services in one location; including supported 
housing, counseling, pharmacotherapy, case management, physical/mental healthcare, and child 
and pediatric care.58,[ADDRESS_521161] comprehensive care models delivered to pregnant women with OUD report few 
outcomes for services such as mental health, housing, and food security issues. A larger and 
more problematic limitation is these models require large amounts of space for in/outpatient services and high volumes of patients/revenue to support staffing expenditures. 
71,72 Altogether, 
currently available integrated care models are limited for effective management of care for chronic disorders, such as addiction, which has serious and harmful consequences. C urrent 
comprehensive care models are arguably not easily implemented, scalable, or sustainable. We 
propose to build on these models to show our patient navigation (PN)  intervention has the 
potential to substantially amplify outcomes for both mother and infant, including the breadth of 
outcomes for both populations in a likely scalable and sustainable model.  
Patient navigation for chronic health conditions.  A highly promising option for chronic care 
management for linking and retaining pregnant women with OUD in treatment is the PN model. 
PN was first developed and implemented in [ADDRESS_521162], Freeman observed an unsettling 5- year survival rate of only 39% among low income 
and uninsured women presenting to the Harlem Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413485].
75,[ADDRESS_521163] services produced substantial improvements for early 
diagnosis and increased 5- year survival to 70%.[ADDRESS_521164] cancer.77 PN has evolved to address other 
conditions; such as HIV, palliative care, spi[INVESTIGATOR_195048], behavioral/mental health disorders, and 
chronic diseases.75,78,[ADDRESS_521165] from other models such as care coordination or basic case management . The 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality distinguishes these models according to the core 
aims of each intervention.78 For example, care coordination is defined by [CONTACT_413552] a patient.78 Each provider is dependent on the others to carry out their 
role.78 Case management is defined by [CONTACT_413553]’s as, “... a 
collaborative process of assessment, planning, facilitation and advocacy for options and services 
to meet an individuals’ health needs through communication and available resources to promote 
quality cost -effective outcomes .” 78,80 PN is unique insofar as its focus is on reducing barriers and 
guiding patients through complex fragmented healthcare and social service systems.75,78 PN does 
not require a floor within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413486]/outpatient services or require a substance abuse treatment program to be embedded within a healthcare setting. Importantly, PN is a model 
of care having a patient -centered philosophy tha t can be provided by [CONTACT_105]-professional (bachelors -
level)  staff.  
Two themes unite and permeate PN models. First ,
  PN breaks down barriers that prevent patients, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_413487], from accessing health, psychiatric, social, and family services.
75,76,78,79,81,82 Barriers often include psychosocial issues such as fear/anxiety, 
communication, transportation, finances, the medical system, and lack of information.75,76,[ADDRESS_521166] of a PN  intervention for pregnant 
women with OUD receiving MAT in a prenatal care clinic  (N=21).  31 Our findings included 
demonstrating clear intervention feasibility and promising initial results for women in a number of 
behavioral and physical health domains, including improvements for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/ substance use, 
mental health, and prenatal care outcomes. 31

 OBJECTIVES  
 Primary Objective s 
Strong evidence supports PN as an evidence- based practice to address various health conditions 
among different populations and settings.79,81,85,88,89 Navigation’s strengths for populations with 
OUD encompass individual- level support, case coordination, and strength- based case 
management that include activities such as: (1) linking patients to OUD treatment, health care, 
and social services, (2) monitoring and encouraging adherence to treatment, (3) shepherding 
follow- through with commitments, and (4) ensuring treatment retention and outreach for women 
who disengage in care. Therefore, given poor neonatal outcomes;  4-7 complex physical, mental, 
and behavioral health comorbidities,  10-17 and social/legal problems for  pregnant women with 
OUD,16,29,30 PN is a likely potent model of care that has excellent prospects for improving health 
and psychosocial outcomes. Accordingly, our Optimizing Pregnancy and Treatment Interventions 
for Moms 2.0 (OPTI -Mom 2.0)  project will expand our proof- of-concept project and conduct a 
small- scale multisite randomized clinical trial. Specifically, this project will achieve three Specific 
Aims (Table 1). Accomplishing the following Aims establishes critical foundational data f or a 
subsequent  fully-powered multisite randomiz ed trial.  
Table 1. OPTI -Mom 2.0 Specific Aims:  
 To enhance the PN intervention to prevent postnatal relapse  
 To expand protocols/procedures for multisite, randomized, health system -wide testing  
 To demonstrate the preliminary benefit of PN for facilitating : linkage to 
treatment/retention in behavioral/physical health care and psychosocial services

• Has been on buprenorphine or methadone for > [ADDRESS_521172] participants. The following methods will be used to recruit women into this study.  
 
• Behavioral health staff  at both performance  sites will be trained in referring possible 
patients to our study.  Behavioral health staff will be trained in the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for this study. OPTI -Mom research staff will reach out to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413491]. When they 
encounter patients who they believe will be eligible for this study, they will relay to patient s 
that they might be eligible for study participatio n (see Study Information Form ). If the 
participant expresses interest in learning more about the study opportunity , the behavioral 
health staff member  will facilitate contact [CONTACT_413556]. I f time does not allow for directly connecting 
the patient to the study staff, the patient will be provided with a study advertisement  
9 
 handout  and/or the behavioral health staff person  will relay patient contact [CONTACT_413557].   
• Patients will be contact[CONTACT_413558][INVESTIGATOR_187582]+Me research registry. 
Patients with ICD9/10 codes for pregnancy  and OUD or opi[INVESTIGATOR_413492]. Potential participants in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me system have already acknowledged 
interest possibly participating in research. All participants are UPMC patients. Once 
contact[CONTACT_413559][INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me, these patients contact [CONTACT_413560].  
• Study staff  at both performance sites will also be trained to identify potentially eligible 
patients using patient medical records systems to locate  women with OUD and who are 
pregnant  (See Magee EMR review 1- 2 and Utah EMR review) . Once identified in the 
medical record systems, patients will be mailed a letter informing them they are eligible 
for a research study . Letters will be mailed to participants as much as  weekly. Letters will 
not disclos e how patients are possibly  eligible in order to protect privacy. Patients will be 
invited to contact [CONTACT_413561]. Patients will also be informed 
in the letter that research staff will contact [CONTACT_214521] a week  of not hearing back from 
them. After a week, research staff will reach out to potential patients.  
• Study flyers will also be posted within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413493] , waiting 
rooms of the performance sites and local outreach sites and facilities (see Advertisement ). 
These flyers will contain general study information and study staff contact [CONTACT_3031].  
 
Study staff who contact [CONTACT_413562] S UPeRAD clinic, staff 
research office space in Research park, staff office space from Magee Womens Research 
Institute  or an appropriate and private location. Calls will be made from study use only cell phones 
or from office phones. Voicemail and other messaging is all password protected. If patients provide an email address, study staff may also contact [CONTACT_413563]. All computers and 
university relat ed email accounts used to contact [CONTACT_413564].  
 
Both sites will capture the number of eligible  patients approached, number of patients 
approached, number of patients who chose to screen and those who did not. Reason for not 
screening will be captured. We will also capture the reason for why patients who were screened 
as ineligible were not eligible. Finally, we also capture the number of patients who chose to 
provide informed consent and those that did not. We will likewise capture the reasons patients 
may given for not providing informed consent and enr olling in the project. All these records will be 
captured using REDCap .  
 
In order to ensure adequate follow up with participants; contact [CONTACT_413565], including phone, text, email, social media, 
and mail. See SOP for C ontinued Engagement.  
[ADDRESS_521173] 
approximately 9 to 12  active (pre and postnatal ) participants at one time .  
[ADDRESS_521174] in learning more about this 
possible study opportunity, staff will receive permission to screen these patients using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Permission for screening will be obtai ned using an oral screening 
consent form (see SOP for Screening, Consent, Locator, Initiation, Assessment and Blinding). 
Those who screen positive will then be provided with the full consent documents for study 
enrollment.  
 Informed Consent Procedures for Participants   
Study procedures and the potential risks and benefits of participating in the trial will be explained  
to participants (see SOP for Screening, Consent, Locator, Initiation, Assessment and Blinding) . 
We also will obtain permission to audio record intervention sessions for intervention fidelity 
monitoring purposes. Given the multi -site nature of the trial, it is possible that ancillary studies will 
be proposed before or after the study begins recruitm ent. For this  reason, during the informed 
consent process, w e also will seek permission to contact [CONTACT_413566]. Staff will be available to answer questions about the consent form while participants are reviewing it.  Prior to signing the consent form, the participant must pass a brief 
consent comprehension tool  to illustrate comprehension of the study activities. After successful 
completion of the tool and signing the consent form, participants will be given a copy to keep for 
their records. The informed consent process will take approximately [ADDRESS_521175] completed all required CITI 
training modules. Drs. Cochran and Krans  will also train the study staff  in survey administration 
methods, specifically with how to appropriately ask sensitive questions and to respond to 
responses from patients regarding sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (including reporting information to study PIs  
12 
 by [CONTACT_413567]). Training will include Drs. Cochran  
and Krans  going over the survey with the research assistant, modeling appropriate 
administration, practicing administration, and supervised administration for the first 3 subjects 
enrolled in the study. The study baseline assessment will happen at the S UPeRAD clinic, 
research offices, Magee Womens Research Institute, or other appropriate and private locations . 
Assessments will be completed using REDCap  surveying technology. Survey responses will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_413568]. Completed surveys will be immediately saved online. The baseline assessment will take approximately 30 -45 minutes.  
 Randomization  
Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized on a 1:[ADDRESS_521176] care (i.e., short -term case management + referral). The study  statistician will create a 
randomization list to assign patients to treatment or control conditions. The statistician will also 
review the randomization data on a regular basis to ensure that the scheme is being implemented 
according to plan. If a participant drops out of the study at any point after randomization, the 
randomization slot will not be re- allocated to a new patient due to the intent -to-treat nature of the 
study.  
 Treatment/Intervention   
Standard care. The standard care condition at Magee and the University of Utah hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413494]. The brief case management involves the participant speaking to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413495] a patient needs assessment in the areas of 
behavioral health and social services. All patients will be referred to MAT and any identified 
behavioral health or social service needs. For MAT, Magee- Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413496] (mono- product) , with continued methadone 
maintenance only provided by [CONTACT_413569].  University of Utah patients are offered 
buprenorphine induction and maintenance ( buprenorphine- naloxone product ) at a local University 
of Utah outpatient clinic  or from community partners. Methadone services for University of Utah 
patients are only provided by [CONTACT_62329]. Staff social workers at Magee and the 
University of Utah will be provided with information on the study each quarter during the study recruitment phase and be instructed to closely follow and not deviate from their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413497]. These quarterly meetings/trainings will be delivered in order to prevent threats to internal validity and biasing study outcomes.  
Patient navigation (PN). Details of the navigation can be found in the PN Intervention Manual . 
The PN intervention will be delivered by [CONTACT_413570]. Table 4 contains details of the PN intervention. The PN intervention will initiate following participant recruitment. It is important to 
note that in Table 2, PN sessions do not strictly coincide with specific weeks of pregnancy since 
the women can be recruited up to ≤ 32 weeks of gestation. The prenatal portion of the intervention 
includes up to 10 sessions delivered prior to delivery . The postnatal portion of the intervention will 
be delivered as 4 sessions over 8 weeks. Women who complete the intervention before delivery will receive regular calls/texts until delivery wherein the navigator will encourage and reinforce 
abstinence and treatment retention (see SOP for continued engagement) . All contact [CONTACT_413571] a participant  contact [CONTACT_413572].  
Our PN model is based on the work of Parker37 and the recently completed Project HOPE study 
(Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413498] -Infected Drug Users).38,[ADDRESS_521177] investigator s.  
The primary goal of the current PN intervention is linking patients before and after delivery to 
treatment/psychosocial care and clinical support for participants’ retention in those services. All 
PN patients will be referred to MAT by [CONTACT_413570]  (see standard care description above 
for site differences for MAT resources ). It is through the navigator linking and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_413499], other SUD, medical, mental health, social, and family services that will 
stimulate positive short - and long- term outcomes for mother and infant. While Magee and the 
University of Utah hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413500], a major challenge for women is link ing to 
services for ongoing MAT and subsequently being  retained in care. Patients will be encouraged 
to work with their providers to choose the form of medication, buprenorphine or methadone, which 
will best meet their needs. The navigator will support and encourage the patient to follow through 
with this tre atment. The PN intervention will also target better compliance with pre/postnatal 
maternal healthcare, more effective transition of newborns into pediatric care, and relapse 
prevention (i.e., Aim 2). The PN intervention specifically encompasses two complementary and 
necessary services: strengths -based case management (SBCM) and 1- to-1 clinical support (see 
Table 2). PN sessions will last 1- 1.5 hours. Furthermore, given the challenges keepi[INVESTIGATOR_413501], the intervention emphasizes community outreach.  For example, the 
navigator can visit the neighborhoods to meet participants’ social and family networks to 
empathically encourage and support engagement with health, social services systems, and recovery support (i.e., narcotics anonymous , alcoholics anonymous) if patients become 
disengaged in care or follow up.  
SBCM  i
s an evidenced- based component of the PN model that has been demonstrated to help 
individuals with substance use disorders and chronic health conditions engage in needed care. 
34,[ADDRESS_521178] a 
variety of positive effects, particularly treatment retention111,112 and linkage with community 
services.113 SBCM utilizes patients’ strengths for goal setting and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a working alliance35 
between providers and patients. The specific elements the navigator will focus on include: helpi[INVESTIGATOR_413502]; accessing and engaging in drug/mental health 
counseling/treatment/mutual support, social services uptake, MAT linkage/retention, and engagement in pre/post -natal care and pediatric/developmental care for newborns. It is important 
to note that participants and the navigator will collaborate to identify already existing health and 
community services that participants will subsequently engage in with the navigator’s assistance.  
One- to-one clinical support  is a paramount PN component for identifying, establishing, and 
retaining health behavior improvement goals. One- to-one clinical support is designed to 
motivate and assist patients recognize and overcome internal/external barriers to care, including: emotional support, decision support, lifestyle change support, monitoring outcomes of 
screening/diagnostics, health behavior, and HIV/HCV prevention education.
37 HIV/HCV 
prevention messaging will address needle sharing and unsafe sex.  Patients will receive support 
and verbal reinforcement for completion of paperwork, engaging in drug/mental health treatment, social services uptake, agonist adherence, and engaging in pediatric/developmental 
care for their infants . One -to-one clinical support will be delivered using motivational 
interviewing  skills .[ADDRESS_521179] women to prepare for, discuss, and successfully 
complete specific maternal milestones . 
 Premature Withdrawal of Participants  
All participants will be followed for the duration of the study unless they withdraw consent, are no longer pregnant due to spontaneous abortion ( miscarriage) or termination that was unplanned at 
the time of enrollment, die, or the investigator or sponsor decides to discontinue their enrollment 
for any reason. Reasons for the investigator or sponsor terminating a participant from the study may include, but are not limited to, the participant becoming a threat to self or others, lack of 
funding, DSMB early termination of the study for safety or effectiveness determination.  
 Study Halting Rules  
The study will be halted based on lack of funding.  
 Follow -Up  
Participants will be assessed at baseline, following the completion of the prenatal portion of the 
intervention, following the postnatal portion of the intervention at approximately [ADDRESS_521180] information verification, patients complete a 
survey assessment similar that completed at the baseline assessment. The study follow up  
assessment s will happen at the S UPeRAD clinic, research offices, Magee Womens Research 
Institute, or other appropriate and private locations using REDCap  surveying technology. Survey 
responses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_413568]. Completed surveys will be 
immediately saved online. The follow up assessments  assessment will take approximatel y 30-
45 minutes  at each visit —see urine drug screen SOP.  
 Blinding  
 Type of Blinding  
This study is a single blinded randomized clinical trial.  
 Maintenance of the Blind  
The individuals blinded to the study condition will be those conducting the study assessments. 
The baseline assessment will be blinded given that the randomization will not be revealed until 
after the assessment is completed. The follow up assessments will be conducted by a blinded 
research assistant.  
 Breaking the Blind   
As the research assistant is the only blinded party, there is no scenario in which the blind will 
need to be broken.  Investigators providing clinical management and decision- making are 
informed of each participants randomization result.

 General Measures  
 Inclusion/Exclusion  
This form lists each inclusion and exclusion criterion to document eligibility. Eligibility is assessed 
continually as appropriate. Only participants who continue to meet study eligibility criteria are 
allowed to continue with the screening process, consent and randomization.  
 Locator Form  
A locator form is used to obtain information to assist in finding participants during treatment and 
at follow -up. This form collects the participant’s current address, email address, and phone 
numbers. In order to facilitate locating participants if direct  contact [CONTACT_200843], 
addresses and phone numbers of family/friends who may know how to reach the participant are 
collected, as well as additional participant information such as social security number  and other 
information to aid in searches of public records. This information will be collected at screening 
and will be updated at each visit. No information from this form is used in data analyses.  
 Demographics Form  
The Demographics f orm collects information about demographic characteristics of the participant, 
including date of birth, ethnicity, race, education, employment status, and marital status. This form 
is completed at screening.  
 Study Completion Form  
This form tracks the participant’s status in the study. It is completed at the final postnatal  visit or 
once the 6-month  follow- up visit window lapses for participants who do not complete this final 
follow- up. This form is used in data analyses to address variables such as treatment retention 
and completion.  This form also provides a location for the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_413503].  
 
 
18 
 
 Clinical and Safety Assessments  
 Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
At each visit the study navigator  assesses for AEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_413574], 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit?” AEs and SAEs may also be spontaneously 
reported to study staff at any visit following consent. AEs and SAEs suggesting medical or 
psychiatric det erioration will be brought to the attention of a study clinician for further evaluation 
and management.  Visits will emphasize  overdose risk and risk -management . Any reported 
overdose is recorded as an AE or SAE , or in a separate form . AE and SAE reporting is according 
to the reporting definitions and procedures outlined in the protocol and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements.   
For the purpose of this study, the following AEs do not require reporting in the data system but is captured in the source documentation as medically indicated:  
Grade 1 (mild) unrelated adverse events . This would typi[INVESTIGATOR_413504], cold, etc., that were considered not reasonably associated with the  study  
intervention . 
 
 Suicidal Behavior Evaluation  
Within the Patient Health Questionnaire is embedded a validated single item suicide screening 
tool. This item is assessed at each visit . If the participant screens positive for depression, the 
navigator will ensure the participant contacts the Resolve Crisis Center to arrange for follow up 
([PHONE_8585])  within the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_413505] (1 -[PHONE_8586] ). If the participant screens 
positive for suicidality,  the navigator will immediately follow the study Suicide Management Plan 
(see REDCap  form). Similarly, if the participant appears to be intoxicated or reports experiencing 
symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], the navigator will immediately notify the site study physician who 
can further assess and direct steps for possible additional care depending on participant need.

 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS   
 Overall  
A Training Plan will be developed to incorporate general training, study -specific training , 
mechanisms for competency assessment as well as a detailed description of training, supervision, 
and fidelity monitoring procedures.  The Investigative Team is responsible for the development of  
a comprehensive Training Plan, instructional material,  and delivery of the training.  
 
Training will include Human Subjects Protection (HSP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as well 
as protocol -specific training on assessments, medication management for pharmacological 
studies, study interventions, safety  and safety event reporting, study visits and procedures, data 
management , quality assurance, laboratory procedures , etc.  The University of Utah site is 
primarily responsible for development and delivery of study -specific training related to the study 
intervention(s) and procedures. The University of Utah site also  is responsible for trai ning related 
to data management , the electronic data capture system, and good data management  practices.  
 
Study staff is r equired to complete institutionally required training per their research site, 
Institutional Review Board(s), and authorities with regulatory oversight . Tracking of training 
completion for individual staff as prescribed for assigned study role(s)  will be documented, 
endorsed  by [CONTACT_1377] [INVESTIGATOR_413506] . As changes occur in the 
prescribed training, the Training Plan and training documentation tracking forms will be amended to reflect these adjustments.

care groups.  
 Study Hypothes es  
H1: PN recipi[INVESTIGATOR_413507]: (a) OUD and other SUD treatment, 
(b) psychosocial services, and (c) pre/postnatal care compared to standard care.  
 
H2: A larger portion of PN patients will be (a) MAT adherent and (b) drug abstinent compared to 
standard care.  
 H3: Higher levels of engagement/retention in care will positively moderate improvements in: (a) 
abstinence, (b) HIV/HCV risk behaviors, (c) depression/anxiety, and (d) child/mother outcomes 
(e.g., health care, NAS, stress).  
 Rationale for Sample Size and Statistical Power   
 Projected Number of Sites   
Two hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413508], recruiting, and engaging with potential 
project participants. Both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413509]’s health 
within their respective health care systems. B oth study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413510], care, and for eventual delivery. Specifically, Magee -
Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413511] a hub for women’s health care in Alleghe ny County as well as 
western PA. This hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341247] a number of health care services to pregnant women, including 
emergency department, obstetrics/gynecology, midwifery, and fertility services. The University of 
Utah is likewise a hub for care in Salt Lake City and the state of UT. This hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413512]-1 trauma center with a number of services available for pregnant women, which include 
obstetrics/gynecology, midwifery, and fertility services.  
 Projected Number of Participants per Site  
Given this study is  designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_413513]/procedures, sample size is not based on a power estimate. Rather, our sample size is 
based on our estimates of how many patients can be screened and consented within the study 
timeframe, an appropriate method for pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602].90 Based on the above detailed counts of MAT 
inductions among pregnant women from Magee -Women s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175351] 2013 and 2017, we 
anticipate an average of 141 potential women recruits each year. Further, based on the above described numbers of total pregnant  women  with OUD/overdose (i.e., poisoning)  from the 
University of Utah from 2015- 2017, we anticipate an average of 58  potential recruits each year. 
Therefore, if we screen and recruit patients across 15 months, and if 70% are eligible and 
interested, and of those, 70% provide informed consent; we will recruit a total of 122 patients in 
this study who will be randomized to the PN (n=61) or standard care conditions (n=61). Importantly , working to recruit, randomize, provide PN/standard care, and retain 122 pregnant 
women with OUD during the study timeframe will allow us sufficient time to learn to implement 
and manage this study across 2 sites in preparation for a subsequent fully -powered trial.  
21 
 While definitive estimation and hypothesis testing are not the aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the target 
sample sizes will allow estimation of odds ratios via 95% confidence intervals comparing outcome 
rates in the treatment and control arms, while accounting fo r within site clustering, with lower 
bounds differing from the odds ratio estimate by a factor of 1/3 to 1/[ADDRESS_521186] approximately 9 to 
12 active (pre and postnatal) participants at one time.  
 
DSMB recommendation on November 1, 2019 was to evenly distribute recruitment goals for both 
sites. This is due to more outside agencies in Pennsylvania that are offering prenatal care and 
services for women with substance use disorders.  
 Statistical Methods for Primary and Secondary Outcomes  
We will employ descriptive statistics to calculate measures of central tendency, frequencies, and 
proportions for patient demographics and substance use, health, social, and mother/child 
indicators. T-tests and χ2 tests will be used to assess mean and proportion differences between 
outcome variables by [CONTACT_413575] . Specifically, we will examine unadjusted 
differences between PN and standard care patients for linkage/retention in: (a) OUD and other 
SUD counseling, (b) psychosocial services , and (c) pre/postnatal care compared to standard care. 
We will also examine unadjusted differences between groups for  MAT adherence, opi[INVESTIGATOR_285774]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_413514], HIV/HCV risk behaviors, depression/anxiety, and child/mother 
outcomes (e.g., NAS, parental stress, attachment, and maternal social support).  
We will also develop a series of multilevel models to examine treatment, time, and covariate 
effects associated with our primary and secondary study outcomes  (Equation 191,92). The 
multilevel framework allows for a flexible treatment of time where change as a putative outcome 
may be nonlinear, accelerates, or decelerates at different rates across time. The framework is 
also forgiving of unequal numbers of observations and unequal spacing of observations across 
participants (i.e., missing data patterns). Models will be constructed using a model -building 
sequence proposed by [CONTACT_413576],93 in which: (a) empi[INVESTIGATOR_413515], (b) an unconditional model will be fit, (c) an unconditional linear growth model will be fit, (d) unconditional non -linear models (e.g., a pi[INVESTIGATOR_413516]) will be fit, (e) the models’ fit in  the 
prior steps will be compared using the Akaike Information Criterion to determine the best growth 
model, and (f) time -invariant (e.g., baseline mental health diagnoses ) and time- varying (e.g., drug 
use) predictors will be added to the models. We will e xamine the association of these predictors 
with the study outcomes  across time. We will also test higher levels of service linkage/retention 
as moderators for improvements in (a) abstinence, (b) HIV/HCV risk behaviors, (c) 
depression/anxiety, and (d) child/mother outcomes . 
Included below is the equation for a random -coefficient multilevel growth model. The 𝑌𝑌 in the 
equation represents a binary opi[INVESTIGATOR_413517] , for example,  for the 𝑖𝑖 th participants  at 
time t. The symbol “~” indicates that the binary response with  linear predictor given by [CONTACT_413577] a logistic mixed effects model, with random effects for site, and 
potentially time within site.  The primary variable types are represented in the equation: (a) time is 
22 
 a variable representing time that may require multiple time variables in the event of nonlinear 
change (e.g. quadratic), (b) time-varying  is any variable measured at each time point, and (c) 
invariant  is a variable measured at the person- level. The model below can easily be extended to 
a third level if it is determined that there is variability in coefficients across centers.

 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE , REPORTING and MONITORING  
 Regulatory Compliance   
This study will be conducted in accordance with the current version of the protocol, in full 
conformity  with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, the Regulations for 
the Protection of Human Subjects codified in the International Council for  Harmonization Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and all other applicable regulatory requirements. An 
Operations Manual will be provided as a reference guide and study quality assurance tool.  
 Statement of Compliance   
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the appropriate protocol, current Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all other applicable regulatory 
requirements. Participating sites must obtain written approval of the study protocol, consent form, 
other supporting documents, and any advertising for participant recruitment from the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)  of record in order to participate in the study. Prior to study initiation, the 
protocol and the inf ormed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_413578]. Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must be approved before they are implemented. Unanticipated problems involving risk to study participants will be promptly reported 
to and reviewed by  [CONTACT_60683] , according to its usual procedures.  
 Institutional Review Board Approval   
Prior to initiating the study, site investigators will obtain written IRB approval to conduct the study at their respective site. If changes to the study protocol become necessary, protocol amendments 
will be submitted in writing by [CONTACT_354355]. In addition, IRBs will approve all consent forms, recruitment materials, and any materials given  to 
the participant , and any changes made to these documents throughout study implementation . For 
changes to the consent form, a decision will be made regarding whether previously consented participants need to be re- consented.  IRB continuing review will be performed annually , or at a 
greater frequency contingent upon the complexity and risk of the study . Each  site principal  
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_413518], IRB -
approved consent documents, and  approval for all protocol modifications. These materials must 
be received by [CONTACT_413579], and must be 
available at any time for audit.  
 
The University of Utah  will be the IRB of record for the protocol, and will provide study oversight 
in accordance with [ADDRESS_521187] entered into reliance/authorization agreements for the study protocol.  
 Informed Consent   
The informed consent process is a means of providing study information to each prospective participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study.  Informed consent 
continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  The informed consent form will include 
all of the required elements of informed consent , and may contain additional relevant consent 
elements . Each study site must have the study informed consent approved by [CONTACT_11577](s). To 
confirm that each consent form contains the required elements of informed consent as delineated in 21 CFR 50.25(a) and CFR 46.116(a), as well as pertinent additional elements detailed in 21 
CFR 50.25(b) and 45 CFR 46.116(b), a copy  of the IRB -approved consent, along with the IRB 
study approval, must be sent to the University of Utah  prior to site initiation and with each 
subsequent consent revision. Every study participant is required to sign a valid, IRB -approved 
current version of the study informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study related 
[ADDRESS_521188] the opportunity to 
discuss the study with their family and close friends or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. If the participant is interested in participating in the study, a staff member will review each section 
of the IRB-approved informed consent form in detail and answer any questions the participant 
may pose. The participant  will consent by [CONTACT_200874]. The person 
obtaining consent and a witness, if required by [CONTACT_1036](s), will also sign and date the consent 
document .  
 
The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever important new safety 
information is available, or whenever the protocol is amended in a way that may affect participants’ 
participation in the trial. A copy of the informed consent will be given to a prospective participant 
to review during the consent process and to keep for reference.  The rights and welfare of the 
participants will be protected by [CONTACT_34693].  The participant will be informed 
that their participation is voluntary and they may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason without penalty. Individuals who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will 
be treated without prejudice. Study sites will be responsible for maintaining signed consent forms 
as source documents for quality assurance review and regulatory compliance.  
 
The study does not preempt any applicable federal, state, or local laws which require additional 
information to be disclosed in order for informed consent to be legally effective. It is in 
conformance with [ADDRESS_521189] to the 
disclosure of substance use disorder patient identifying information in the absence of the informed 
consent process and HIPAA authorization.  
On 4/2 /[ADDRESS_521190] a sponsor assigned monitor, the investigator has 
25 
 delegated this responsibility to the lead site who will oversee aspects of site conformity to make 
certain the site staff is  operating within the confines of the protocol, and in accordance with GCP. 
This includes but is not limited to protocol compliance, documentation review , and ensuring the 
informed consent process is being correctly followed and documented. Non- conformity with 
protocol and federal regulations can be reported as a protocol deviation and submitted to the IRB 
for further review.  
 Participant and Data Confidentiality   
Confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with all applicable federal regulations and/or 
state/Commonwealth law and regulations. By [CONTACT_200877],  the investigator 
affirms that information furnished to the investigator will be maintained in confidence and such 
information will be divulged to the IRB /Privacy Board, Ethical Review Committee, or similar expert 
committee; affiliated institution; and employees only under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such board or committee, affiliated institution and employees.  
 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, t he lead investigator will obtain a federal 
Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC)  from NIH , which protects identifiable research information from 
forced disclosure, and will distribute it to all sites when received. This protect s participants against 
disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., drug use) . The CoC allows the investigator and others 
who have access to research records to permanently refuse to disclose identifying information on 
research participation in any civil, criminal, adminis trative, legislative, or other proceeding, 
whether at the federal, state, or local level , excepting certain circumstances . 
 
By [CONTACT_413580], the Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research 
objectives and promote participation in studies by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_413519].  The NIH office that issues the CoC will be advised of changes in the CoC application 
information. Participating sites will be notified if CoC revision is necessary. Participant records will 
be held confidential by [CONTACT_360319], secure storage 
of any documents that have participant identifiers, and secure computing procedures for entering 
and transferring electronic data.  
 
Per Section [ADDRESS_521191] (HIPAA)   
Study sites will be  required to obtain authorization from participants for use of protected health 
information. Sites will be responsible for communicating with the IRBs or Privacy Boards  of record  
and obtaining the appropriate approvals or waivers to be in regulatory compliance. Releases of 
participant identifying information that are permitted by [CONTACT_9911], but which are 
prohibited by [CONTACT_9912]/or state/C ommonwealth law and regulation, 
are prohibited.  
 Investigator Assurances  
 Financial Disclosure /Conflict of Interest  
All investigators will comply with the requirements of [ADDRESS_521192] periodic  review  to examine whether study procedures are conducted 
appropriately and that study data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with 
the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations. Reviews will occur at mutually agreed upon times, 
regulatory documents, case report forms (CRFs), informed consent forms and corresponding 
source documents for each participant. Reviews will verify that study procedures are properly 
followed , site personnel are trained and able t o conduct the protocol appropriately , whether 
submitted data are accurate and in agreement with source documentation and review regulatory/essential documents such as correspondence with the IRB. Reports will be prepared 
following the visit and forwarded to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_413520] s. 
Reviewers will have the opportunity and ability to view any study -associated document or file.  If 
the review of study documentation indicates that additional training of site study personnel is needed, the reviewer will undertake or arrange for that training.  
 Prisoner Certification  
As per [ADDRESS_521193] promptly notify the IRB of this occurrence.  
 Regulatory Files   
The regulatory files should contain all required regulatory documents, study -specific documents, 
and all important communications. Regulatory files will be checked at each participating site for 
regulatory document compliance prior to study initiation, thr oughout the study, as well as at study 
closure.  
 Records Retention and Requirements   
Research records for all study participants (e.g., case report forms, source documents, signed consent forms,  audio and video recordings,  and regulatory files) are to be maintained by [CONTACT_1275] s in a secure location for a minimum of [ADDRESS_521194] be received by  [CONTACT_413581].  
 
27 
 
 Study Documentation  
Each participating site will maintain appropriate study documentation (including medical and 
research records) for this trial, in compliance with regulatory and institutional requirements for the 
protection of confidentiality of participants. Study documentation includes all case report forms, 
workbooks, source documents, monitoring logs and appointment schedules, sponsor -investigator 
correspondence, and signed protocol and amendments, Ethics Review Committee or Institutional Review Board correspondence and approved consent form and signed participant consent forms.  
As part of participating in a CDC study, each site will permit authorized representatives from CDC  
and regulatory agencies to examine (and when permitted by [CONTACT_2371], to copy) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress, and 
data validity.  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study. 
Whenever possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the source 
document; however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and exact 
duplication of the original document.  
 Protocol Deviations   
Any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol will be classified as 
either a major or minor protocol deviation. The difference between a major and minor protocol 
deviation has to do with the seriousness of the event and the corrective action required. A minor 
protocol deviation is considered an action (or inaction) that by [CONTACT_200884], rights, or welfare of a study 
participant. Major pro tocol deviations are departures that may compromise the participant safety, 
participant rights, inclusion/exclusion criteria or the integrity of study data and could be cause for 
corrective actions if not rectified or prevented from re- occurrence. Sites wi ll be responsible for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_9818]. C orrective 
action plans will be reviewed/approved by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_413521] . All 
protocol deviations will be monitored at each site for (1) significance, (2) frequency, and (3) impact 
on the study objectives, to ensure that site performance does not compromise the integrity of the 
trial. All proto col deviations will be recorded, reviewed by [CONTACT_978], and saved in the study electronic 
files. Additionally, each site is responsible for reviewing the IRB  of record’s definition of a protocol 
deviation or violation and understanding which events need to be reported. Sites must recognize 
that the IRB definition of a reportable event may differ and act accordingly in following all reporting 
requirements for both entities.  
 Adverse Events (AEs)   
Specific adverse events that will be collected in this study are described in further detail in 
Appendix A. 
Two study clinicians are have been appointed in this project , who will review or provide 
consultation for each Serious Adverse Event (SAE) as needed at each site . These reviews will 
include an assessment of the possible relatedness of the event to the study intervention or other study procedures. Study clinician s will also provide advice for decisions to exclude, refer, or 
withdraw participants as required.  
Each of the sites has established practices for managing medical and psychiatric emergencies, 
and the study staff will continue to utilize these procedures. Treatment providers at each site will 
28 
 be responsible for monitoring participants for possible clinical deterioration or other problems, and 
for implementing appropriate courses of action.  
29 
 
 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
1.0 OVERSIGHT OF CLINICAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
A. Site Principal Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_9842]’s Principal Investigator ( PI) is responsible for study oversight, including 
ensuring human research subject protection by [CONTACT_9939], trained 
research staff and medical clinicians to assess, report, and monitor adverse events. A ll adverse 
events (AEs) occurring during the course of the clinical trial will be collected, documented, and 
reported by [CONTACT_9940]- investigators according to the Protocol , see Appendix. The 
occurrence of AEs and s erious adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed at each clinic visit during 
the study. Serious adverse events will be followed until resolved or considered stable. Reportable AEs are required to be entered into the data system within 7 days of the site  staff becoming aware 
of the event. Reportable SAEs (including death and life- threatening events)  are required to be 
entered into data system within 24 hours of site's knowledge of the event).  
B. Medical Monitor  
The site study clinician  is responsible for reviewing all adverse events and serious adverse events 
reported. All SAEs will be reviewed at the time they are reported data capture program. The site 
clinician will also indicate concurrence or not with the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_7880]. 
Where further information is needed , the study clinician will discuss the event with the site  staff.  
All AEs are reviewed on a regular  basis to observe trends or unusual events.  
C. Data and Safety Monitoring  
The study Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will involve monthly meetings held to discuss subject 
health and general research issues. Any serious and unexpected adverse changes in a subject's 
clinical status that are associated with the research intervention will be immediately brought to 
the attention of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_413522]. A description of any such events will 
be conveyed to the IRB. Meetings will include, but not be limited to, reviewing the following data for patients:  
• Level of depression  
• Attendance prenatal care 
• Adherance to MAT  
• Food/housing insecurity  
• Issues with interpersonal violence 
• Illicit drug use  
The DSMP will also involve the PI, site PI, and coinvestigators evaluating the progress of the 
research study, including assessments of data quality and timeliness and participant recruitment, 
accrual, and retention. Clinical outcomes and adverse event data will be used to determine 
whether there is any change in the anticipated benefit -to-risk ratio for study participants and 
whether the study should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be 
terminated. The PI, site PI, and coinvestigators will also assess external factors or relevant 
information (e.g., pertinent scientific literature) that may have an impact on the safety of study 
participants or the ethics of the research study and review study procedures designed to protect 
the privacy of the research subjects and confidentiality of their research data.  
We will also recruit two Data Safety Monitoring Board members, one from the University of Utah 
and one from University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], who will review information generated by [CONTACT_58868] 
[ADDRESS_521195] annually. Furthermore, the DSMB will be informed of 
expedited reports of SAEs . The DSMB will make recommendations as to whether there is 
sufficient support for continuation of the trial, evidence that study procedures should be changed, 
or evidence that the trial (or a specific site) should be halted for reasons relating to safety of the 
study participants or inadequate trial performance (e.g., poor recruitment).  Following each DSMB 
meeting, outcomes will communicated , based on DSMB recommendations, in writing to the study 
PI. This communication summarizing  study safety information will be submitted to participat ing 
IRBs.  
D. Quality Assurance (QA) Monitoring  
The monitoring of the study site (s) will be conducted on a semi -annual  basis. The purpose of 
these visits is to assess compliance with  the protocol,  GCP requirements , and other applicable 
regulatory requirements, as well as  to document the integrity of the trial progress. The 
investigative site will provide direct access to all trial related sites (e.g., pharmacy, research 
office), source data/documentation, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing, as 
well as inspection by [CONTACT_242524] y authorities. Areas of particular concern will be the review 
of inclusion/ exclusion criteria, participant Informed Consent Forms, protocol adherence, safety 
monitoring, IRB reviews and approvals, regulatory documents, participant records, and PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_9815]. The reviewer  will interact with the site  staff  to identify 
issues and re- train the site as needed to enhance research quality.  
QA Site Visit Reports will be prepared by [CONTACT_413582].  These reports will 
be sent to the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_413523] .  
E. Database Protection  
The database will be secured with password protection. The manager will receive only coded 
information that is entered into the database under those identification numbers. Electronic 
communication with outside collaborators will involve only unidentifiable information.  
F. Management of Risks to Participants  
Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of participant records will be secured by [CONTACT_360319], and secure storage of any documents that have participant identifiers  on 
site, as well as  secure computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data. The 
documents or logs linking the study codes with the study participant on site will be kept locked separately from the study files and the medical records.  No identifying information will be 
disclosed in reports, publications or presentations.  
Information That Meet s Reporting Requirements 
The consent form will specifically state the types of information that are required for report ing and 
that the information will be reported as required. These include suspected or known sexual or 
physical abuse of a child or elders, or threatened violence to self and/or others.  
 
[ADDRESS_521196] be will stored on University of Utah cloud computing servers and/or archives 
for long term -storage. Electronic access to these data are password protected, encrypted, and 
HIPAA compliant. Physical access will be protected by [CONTACT_413583] i n locked cabinets inside locked 
facilities. Data will be de -identified before sharing with other investigators on a need to know basis, 
and on the agreement that once the data analysis is complete, the data will be returned or destroyed. Data will only be shared with investigators with appropriate data sharing agreements 
and/or Institutional Review Board for Human subjects approvals, as required.

 DATA MANAGEMENT   
 Design and Development   
The University of Utah site will be responsible for development of electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs), development and validation of the clinical study database, ensuring data integrity, and 
training site and participating staff at both sites on applicable data management procedures. This 
will also include the Univer sity of Utah site working to:  1) develop a data management plan and 
will conduct data management activities in accordance with that plan, 2) provide final guided 
source documents and eCRFs for the collection of all data required by [CONTACT_1758], 3) develop data 
dictionaries for each eCRF that will comprehensively define each data element, 4) conduct 
ongoing data monitoring activities on study data from all participating sites, 5) monitor any 
preliminary analysis data cleani ng activities as needed, and 6) rigorously monitor final study data 
cleaning.  The remainder of this section provides an overview of the data management plan 
associated with this protocol.  
 Site Responsibilities   
The University of Utah will provide study leadership for data management, analysis, and reporting. The University of Utah will train staff at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_413524], 
procedures, and security. Both sites will ensure before participant  and other study data is 
uploaded to the data capture program , patient reported responses to interview questions are 
complete and accurate. Site audits will involve the University of Utah project coordinator reviewing 
uploaded study data to ensure completeness and accuracy of data. A trained University of Utah 
research staff member  in day to day study operations  will perform data reviews to ensure 
uploaded data from sites  are complete and accurate.  
 Data Collection   
The data collection process consists of direct data entry at the study sites into the data capture 
program . In the event that the data capture program  is not available, the University of Utah site 
will make available  a final set of guided source documents and completion instructions. Data entry 
into the data capture program  should be completed according to the instructions provided and 
project specific training. The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, complete and 
up-to-date records, and f or ensuring the completion of the eCRFs for each research participant.  
 Data Editing   
Completed data will be entered into the data capture program . If incomplete or inaccurate data 
are found, a query will be generated to the sites for a response. Sites will resolve data 
inconsistencies and errors and enter all corrections and changes into the data capture program.  
 Data Transfer/Lock  
The University of Utah study statistician and statistical program  will conduct final data quality 
assurance checks and “lock” the study database from further modification.  
 Data Quality Assurance  
To address the issue of data entry quality, the University of Utah  will follow a standard data 
monitoring plan. An acceptable quality level prior to study lock or closeout will be established as 
a part of the data management plan. The management plan will entail the project coordinator 
generating regular  data quality summaries during the course of the protocol.  This will specifically 
involve building composite indicators and running descriptive statistics each month during 
participant recruitment and follow  up.

 APPENDIX A: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND 
PROCEDURES   
Each participating site’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9835], including 
ensuring human research subject protection by [CONTACT_9935], report, and monitor adverse events.  See AE form in the electronic 
data capture program.  
 
Definition of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any unexpected medical occurrence in humans, whether or not 
considered study intervention related which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. C hanges  
from baseline in clinical status ; i.e., death, miscarriage, pre -term birth, overdose, relapse, child 
protective services  involvement including child removal ; that are considered clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_413584].  
 
Suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study intervention caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that the study intervention caused the event.  
 
Adverse reaction  is any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_34144].  
 
An adverse event, suspected adverse reaction, or  adverse reaction  is considered “ serious” 
(i.e., a serious adverse event, serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction) if, in the view of either the study medical clinician or sponsor, it:  
 
1) Results in death: A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the study staff during the protocol -defined follow -up period, whether or not considered 
caused by [CONTACT_34144], must be reported.  
2) Is life -threatening: Life -threatening means that the study participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_9836], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred and required immediate intervention.  
3) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
4) Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
5) Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
6) Is an i mportant medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event.   
Definition of Expectedness 
Any adverse event is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the protocol, consent, or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_521197] in the 
assessment of worsening in intensity or severity of these conditions that would indicate an AE. 
Stable chronic conditions, such as arthritis, which are pr esent prior to clinical trial entry and do 
not worsen are not considered AEs.  
 Site’s Role in Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events  
Appropriately qualified and trained personnel will elicit participant reporting of AEs and SAEs at each study visit designated to collect AEs. Adverse events (medical and/or psychiatric) 
assessment will initiate with participant consent and follow -up will continue through the final 
assessment. Study personnel will obtain as much information as possible about the reported 
AE/SAE to complete the AE/SAE forms and will consult as warranted.  
 
Standard reporting, within 7 days of the site becoming aware of the event, is required for 
reportable AEs. Expedited reporting (within 24 hours of their occurrence and/or site's knowledge 
of the event) is required for reportable SAEs (including death and l ife-threatening events). Local 
sites are responsible for reporting SAEs to the IRB  of record, per the IRB  or record’s guidelines.  
 
Sites are required to enter reportable AEs and SAEs in data capture program . The AE form is 
used to capture reportable AEs and SAEs (as defined in the protocol)  and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_83058] [INVESTIGATOR_413526]. Additional information may need to be gathered to evaluate SAEs and to complete the appropriate CRFs and the summary. This process may include obtaining hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413527], medical records, autopsy records or any other type records or information  
necessary to provide a complete and clear pi[INVESTIGATOR_413528]. If the SAE is not resolved or stable at the time of the initial report or if new 
information becomes available after the initial report, follow -up information must be submitted as 
soon as possible.  
 
Reportable adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization or study end. Any serious 
adverse reactions will be followed until resolution or stabilization even beyond the end of the 
study.  
 
Site’s Role in Assessing Severity and Causality of Adverse Events  
Appropriately qualified and trained study personnel will conduct an initial assessment of 
seriousness, severity, and causality when eliciting participant reporting of adverse events. A study 
medical clinician will review reportable AEs for seriousness, sev erity, and causality on at least a 
weekly basis.  
 
  
36 
 Guidelines for Assessing Severity  
The severity of an adverse event refer s to the intensity of the event:  
 
Grade 1  Mild Transient or mild discomfort (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 48 hours), no or 
minimal medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_266772] (non- prescription or single- use 
prescription therapy may be employed to relieve symptoms, 
e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_266773], acetaminophen for post -
surgical pain)  
Grade 2  Moderate  Mild to moderate limitation in activity some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
Grade 3  Severe  Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually 
required; medical intervention/ therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].  
 
Guidelines for Determining Causality  
The study medical clinician will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse event to study medication/intervention where an affirmative answer designates the event as a 
suspected adverse reaction:  
 Is there a reasonable possibility that the study i ntervention caused the event?  
 Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
The DSMB will receive listing of AEs and summary reports of all SAEs at a frequency requested 
by [CONTACT_4318], but at least annually. Furthermore, the DSMB will be informed of expedited reports 
of SAEs.  
 
Participant Withdrawal  
The study medical clinician must apply his/her clinical judgment to determine whether or not an adverse event is of sufficient severity to require that the participant be withdrawn from further 
study intervention. The study medical clinician should consult  with the lead investigator as 
needed. If necessary, a study medical clinician may suspend any trial interventions and institute 
the necessary medical therapy to protect a participant from any immediate danger. A participant may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he/she perceives as an intolerable 
adverse event or for any other reason. If voluntary withdrawal is requested, the participant will be 
asked to complete an end- of-study visit to assure safety and will be given recommendations for 
medical care and/or referrals to treatment, as necessary.

7Study Population: The study population will consist of patients 13 years of age or older with a 
diagnosis of asthma, currently on an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a long-acting beta 2agonist 
(LABA), using an albuterol rescue inhaler as part of their existing asthma treatment regimen. 
Additionally, patients will have uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma quantified as an Asthma Control Test (ACT) score of less than 19 at the screening or baseline visit.
Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints: The primary and secondary study 
objectives and endpoints are presented in Table 1.
Table 1: Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints
Objectives Endpoints
The primary objective of 
this study is to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the DS compared to a concurrent control (CC) group. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients for the DS 
and CC groups achieving meaningful improvement, which is 
defined as an ACT score greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_285265] score from baseline at the end of the 12-week 
treatment period.
The secondary objective 
(#1) is to describe the 
asthma management actions 
by [CONTACT_235628] (iHCPs) for all patients in both groups. This secondary endpoint is the frequency and types of 
interventions done to improve asthma control including:
!number of discussions between patient and iHCP regarding inhaler technique or adherence
!number of adjustments of therapy including:
oincreased or decreased doses of inhaled medication
ochange to different inhaled medication
oadditional inhaled medication
oaddition of a systemic corticosteroid medication for asthma or another controller, including a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or 
biologics
!frequency of intervention to manage comorbid 
conditions associated with poor asthma control 
(gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], sinusitis, 
etc.)
The secondary objective 
(#2) is to evaluate short-
acting beta 2agonist (SABA) 
usage and the number of 
SABA-free days in the DS group.This secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the 
mean weekly SABA usage and the change from baseline in the 
number of SABA-free days over the 12-week treatment period for the DS group.

8Objectives Endpoints
The secondary objective 
(#3) is to assess the usability 
and acceptability of the DS 
by [CONTACT_235629].This secondary endpoint is the assessment of the DS (eMDPI, 
App and dashboard) acceptability and usability, utilizing the 
System Usability Scale (SUS), completed by [CONTACT_16938], 18 years of age or older, and the investigational 
center personnel at the end of the study.
The secondary objective 
(#4) is to assess behavioral 
correlates of responsiveness 
to digital health technology among patients for all patients in both groups.This secondary endpoint is the assessment of patients’ beliefs 
and perceptions about their disease and treatment, utilizing the 
Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) to both the DS and 
CC groups, patients 18 years of age or older, describing their 
behavioral profile at baseline and at the end of the study.
The secondary objective 
(#5) is to evaluate the safety 
of Albuterol eMDPI.This secondary endpoint is the reporting of adverse events related to Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235563].
The safety endpoints for this study include the following for all 
patients in both groups:
!adverse event data
!adverse device effect data
Notes: The Digital System (DS) group will include eligible study population patients who will use the DS (eMDPI, 
App, DHP [Cloud solution], and dashboard) during the treatment period. The concurrent control (CC) group will 
include eligible patients who will be treated with their standard of care albuterol-administering rescue inhalers and 
will not use the DS during the treatment period.

9General Study Design: This is a 12-week treatment, multicenter, open-label, randomized, 
parallel group comparison feasibility study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Albuterol eMDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_16852], including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard, to optimize outcomes in 
patients at least [ADDRESS_285266] of a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), a 12-week open-label treatment 
period with Visit 2, and a follow-up telephone call (2 weeks following treatment completion).
Patients with suboptimal asthma control will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to 1 of 2 parallel groups stratified by [CONTACT_16940]: DS group patients utilizing the 
Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852], including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard, and CC 
group patients who will include eligible patients who will be treated with their standard of care albuterol-administering rescue inhalers and will not use the DS during the treatment period. 
Similar data will be collected regarding outcomes for the CC group: ACT after [ADDRESS_285267] a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), at which they will be asked if they use 
a smart device and use different applications on their smartphones. A baseline ACT score for all 
patients, and BMQ and BIPQ responses for patients 18 years of age or older, will be collected. Once randomized, patients in the DS group will be trained on the use of the Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852] 
(including instructions on how to use both the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235564]) and, upon demonstrating 
competency, will receive [ADDRESS_285268] their rescue treatment during the study. Additional Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235565], based on patients’ needs. Patients in the CC group will be 
reimbursed or given a voucher to use to purchase their existing rescue medications. 
Investigational centers will receive similar instruction regarding features of the App, as well as 
features of the associated dashboard, which mirrors the digital information obtained from the 
eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235566], including frequency and times of SABA rescue use and associated inspi[INVESTIGATOR_235567].
The CC group will be followed according to the clinical judgment of the investigator; the asthma 
of patients in the CC group will be managed in a manner consistent with the clinical judgement of the investigator and based on asthma management guidelines (eg, GINA). Similar to the 
management of the CC group, the DS group patients will be followed by [CONTACT_235630] [INVESTIGATOR_235568], respectively. The 
iHCPs will check the dashboard at least once a week and use this information, as per their 
clinical judgment, to modify patients’ asthma management. Clinically Driven Assessments for both groups, if necessary, should be arranged per the clinical judgement of the iHCP managing 
the patient and can be via a telephone call or an on-site visit.
For all patients, at Visit [ADDRESS_285269] 
answers to Asthma Management questions, including discussions regarding adherence, or inhaler 
technique, treatment adjustments, or additions of new treatments, including biologic medication 
usage. Additionally, in the case of a Clinically Driven Assessment, (for patients in the DS group), the iHCP will be asked whether or not the contact [CONTACT_235631].

10At the end of the treatment period (12 weeks), final assessments of the DS and CC group patients 
will be made, as specified in Table 3. A follow-up telephone call will be made by [CONTACT_235632], [ADDRESS_285270] returned to previous asthma treatments.
It should also be noted that no specific clinical decisions are being mandated. One secondary 
objective of this study is to describe how clinicians actually use the information provided by [CONTACT_16943].
Study procedures and assessments with their time points are shown in Table 3 . The study 
schematic diagram is shown in Figure 2 .
Method of Randomization and Blinding:
Patients will be randomly assigned to the DS group or CC group in a 1:1 ratio stratified by 
[CONTACT_16940], respectively, using a Randomization and Trial Supply Management 
(RTSM) system. 
This is an open-label study, and therefore, blinding is not applicable.

Statistical Considerations
This section describes the statistical analysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study. 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analyses will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. After finalization of the Statistical Analysis Plan, any additional analyses or changes to analyses that may be required will be fully disclosed in the clinical study report 
(CSR).
Sample Size Rationale:
Sample size estimates are based upon the assumption that the absolute differences between the 
DS and CC groups and the associated operational characteristics will be similar to the absolute 
differences and operational characteristics of the DS and CC groups noted in the sample size rationale for the study design.
9HUVLRQ   
&/1  $SSURYHG 3DJHRI
Parallel-group, Controlled Study - Asthma
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study ABS-AS-[ZIP_CODE]
13The recommended sample size for the study is 150 evaluable patients per group 
([ADDRESS_285274] 10 patients), 
300 patients in total. Accounting for a dropout rate of 10%, this leads to a recommended total 
number of 330 enrolled patients. 
With this sample size and assuming a true absolute difference in proportions (treatment effect as 
the estimated response rate for the CC group is 60% and for the DS group is 73%) between the 
groups of at least 13%, the probability that the posterior probability will be at least 95% is 0.77 (power) (analogous to 1-sided p-value < 0.05). Assuming no treatment effect (difference in 
proportions between the groups is 0%, ie, Type 1 error), then the probability that posterior 
probability will be at least 95% is 0.05.
It should be noted that both power and Type 1 error are dependent on the absolute difference 
between the DS and the CC groups as illustrated in Figure 1 below by [CONTACT_235633]:
Figure 1: Operational Characteristics Calculated for the Study Design
Analysis Sets
Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set (ITT)
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized patients. In the ITT analysis set, 
treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received. This analysis population will be used for 
summarization of patient disposition and demographic and baseline characteristics, as 
appropriate.
Modified Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set (mITT)
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set including only 
patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP (IMP is albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235570]-of-care albuterol-administering rescue medication for the CC group) and at least 
1 postbaseline assessment on any of the study endpoints (primary, secondary, or exploratory).

Parallel-group, Controlled Study - Asthma
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_285275] 1 dose of IMP and 
all patients in the CC group. In the safety analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the 
treatment patients actually received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized, unless otherwise specified. This analysis set will be used for all safety analyses.
Additional analysis sets may be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan, if appropriate.
Analysis
Primary Analysis:
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients reaching well-controlled asthma as defined by 
[CONTACT_16979] [ADDRESS_285276] score from baseline at the end of 
the 12-week treatment period (responder analysis of DS versus CC group with responders 
defined by [CONTACT_16979] [ADDRESS_285277] score).
Estimand framework:
1. Analysis will be performed on the mITT set. 
2. A binary distribution is assumed for the primary endpoint. Patients who discontinue early 
due to technology failure, disliking the digital platform, disease worsening, adverse 
experience or disliking the IMP will be counted as treatment failures. For those who discontinue early not due to these reasons, the ACT value assessed at the Early 
Termination (ET) visit will be used. 
3. Summary measure: A successful differentiation between the 2 groups will be determined 
by a Bayesian posterior probability for  
 >0 greater than 0.95 (1-sided). The following 
statistical methods will be utilized:
Logistic regression model allowing for different response rates at enrolling investigational 
centers will be used for testing the hypothesis   :  =0,   :  >0in the following model:
     
1−   =  +                   +     
where i = treatment group, j = investigational center, x ij= treatment group i for investigational 
center j, pij= response proportion of treatment group i in investigational center j. 
Non-informative priors will be assumed for all coefficients.
Estimates of odds ratio and individual proportions with corresponding credible intervals will be 
presented.
Sensitivity Analysis: If appropriate, sensitivity analyses will be specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.

All secondary endpoints will be based on the mITT analysis set and analyzed descriptively. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number [n], mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum) will be provided for observed values and changes from baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.
Other Analysis: NA
Analysis of Exploratory/Other Endpoints:
 
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity: 
Since there is only 1 primary endpoint-based statistical analysis and the multiple secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis techniques, no adjustments for multiple comparisons/multiplicity will be made for the preplanned multiple 
comparisons/endpoints.
Safety Analyses: Safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set.
Safety assessments and time points are provided in Table 3 .
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term (PT) or system organ class (SOC) category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse 
events (overall and by [CONTACT_926]), adverse events determined by [CONTACT_235634] (ie, reasonable possibility) (defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by [CONTACT_926]), serious adverse events, adverse events causing withdrawal from the study, and 
adverse device effects. Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_11364]. 
Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.
Changes in vital signs measurements data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be 
compared with predefined criteria to identify potentially clinically significant values or changes, and such values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_16946].
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum) will be provided for observed values and changes from baseline to each time 
point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, adverse device 
effects, and potentially clinically significant abnormal values (vital signs) based on predefined 
criteria will be provided as well.
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the CSR.
Planned Interim Analysis: There will be no formal interim analysis.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_285288] structure and function, increasing the morbidity 
and mortality of those affected ( Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 2018 ). 
As the recommended drug for relief of acute asthmatic symptoms and as the prophylaxis for 
exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, short-acting beta
2agonists (SABAs), such as albuterol, are 
a mainstay of asthma management. Albuterol sulfate is a beta 2-adrenergic agonist with the 
chemical name α1 [(tert butylamino) meth yl]-4-hydroxy-m-xylene- α,αʹ-diol sulfate (2:1) [salt]. 
The use of inhaled aerosol medications for asthma is ideal because inhalation delivers relatively 
low doses of the drug rapi[INVESTIGATOR_235572]. This preferred administration mode achieves high drug concentrations in the airways while minimizing systemic side effects ( Dolovich et al 
2005). Inhaled albuterol aerosols are the most commonly prescribed treatments for the relief of bronchoconstriction. 
Although albuterol has traditionally been administered via conventional “press-and-breathe” 
metered dose inhalers (MDIs), inefficient inhaler technique (ie, inability to properly coordinate 
actuation with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) is a common problem with these devices; as a consequence, delivery of the active drug to the airways can be compromised, potentially resulting in suboptimal clinical 
benefits ( Allen et al [ADDRESS_285289] et al 2003 ). To 
eliminate the necessity for coordinating actuation with inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], Teva developed the breath-
actuated inhaler PROAIR
®RESPI[INVESTIGATOR_16872]®(albuterol sulfate inhalation powder), which utilizes a 
formulation blend of albuterol sulfate with lactose as an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Breath actuation has been found to reduce administration errors in comparison with conventional MDIs ( Lenney et al 2000, 
Price et al 1999 ). 
PROAIR RESPI[INVESTIGATOR_235573] (US) since March 2015. It is indicated for treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients [ADDRESS_285290] disease and prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in 
patients 4 years of age and older. 
On 21 December 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Albuterol 
multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) with an integrated electronic module (eMDPI) as 
PROAIR
®DIGIHALER™ (albuterol sulfate inhalation powder), 90 mcg of albuterol base per 
actuation, for the same indication as PROAIR RESPI[INVESTIGATOR_16872]. PROAIR DIGIHALER contains a 
built-in electronic module (eModule; ie, the Digihaler) that detects, records, and stores data on 
inhaler events for transmission to a mobile application (App). More detailed prescribing 
information for this product may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
In this study, 90 mcg of albuterol sulfate is delivered via PROAIR DIGIHALER. Teva has 
developed the eModule (ie, the Digihaler) as part of a Digital System (DS) to assist a patient with

25asthma to appropriately use the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16876]. The system is described in more practical terms 
as an inhaler with integrated data logger capable of storing and transmitting timestamped data.
The information from the eModule will be transmitted wirelessly (Bluetooth Low Energy) to the 
smart device App. From the App, data may be transmitted to the Digital Health Platform (DHP), which consists of a Cloud solution, and then to a provider-facing dashboard. The DHP is used to 
provide patient-specific data to the iHCP via the dashboard, a secure web interface. The 
following devices will be evaluated in this study:
Device 1: The Albuterol eMDPI, which is the test investigational medicinal product 
(IMP)
Device 2: Patient-facing AppDevice 3: DHP (Cloud solution) 
Device 4: Provider-facing dashboard
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether outcomes for patients using the Albuterol eMDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_235574] a concurrent control (CC) group who will be treated with their 
standard of care albuterol-administering rescue inhalers and will not use the DS during the 
treatment period. The study will also assess mean weekly SABA usage and the number of SABA-free days, the asthma management actions of investigational heath care providers (iHCPs) 
using the dashboard as part of the DS, and will collect information using patient questionnaires 
that focus on patients’ beliefs and perceptions about their disease and inhaler satisfaction, as well as patient and investigational center personnel questionnaires on system usability.
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
Brief summaries of the clinical studies are provided in this section. 
Bronchospasm Associated with Asthma: In two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies of identical design (Study 1 and Study 2), albuterol sulfate MDPI 
(153 patients) was compared to a matched placebo dry powder inhaler (163 patients) in asthmatic 
patients 12 to 76 years of age at a dose of 180 mcg albuterol 4 times daily. Patients were maintained on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment. Serial measurements of forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_184849] 1 second (FEV

272. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
2.1. Primary and Secondary Study Objectives and Endpoints
The primary and secondary study objectives and endpoints are:
Objectives Endpoints
The primary objective of 
this study is to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the DS compared to a CC group. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients for the DS 
and CC groups achieving meaningful improvement, which is defined as an Asthma Control Test (ACT) score greater than or 
equal to [ADDRESS_285292] score from baseline at the end of the 12-week treatment period. 
The secondary objective 
(#1) is to describe the 
asthma management actions 
by [CONTACT_235636].This secondary endpoint is the frequency and types of 
interventions done to improve asthma control including:
!number of discussions between patient and iHCP regarding inhaler technique or adherence
!number of adjustments of therapy including:
oincreased or decreased doses of inhaled 
medication
ochange to different inhaled medication
oadditional inhaled medication
oaddition of a systemic corticosteroid medication 
for asthma or another controller, including a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or biologics
!frequency of intervention to manage comorbid conditions associated with poor asthma control 
(gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], sinusitis, 
etc.)
The secondary objective 
(#2) is to evaluate SABA 
usage and the number of 
SABA-free days in the DS group.This secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the 
mean weekly SABA usage and the change from baseline in the 
number of SABA-free days over the 12-week treatment period 
for the DS group.

28Objectives Endpoints
The secondary objective 
(#3) is to assess the usability 
and acceptability of the DS 
by [CONTACT_235629].This secondary endpoint is the assessment of the DS (eMDPI, 
App and dashboard) acceptability and usability, utilizing the SUS, completed by [CONTACT_16938], 18 years of 
age or older, and the investigational center personnel at the end 
of the study.
The secondary objective 
(#4) is to assess behavioral 
correlates of responsiveness 
to digital health technology among patients for all patients in both groups.This secondary endpoint is the assessment of patients’ beliefs and perceptions about their disease and treatment, utilizing the BMQ and the BIPQ to both the DS and CC groups, patients 18 years of age or older, describing their behavioral profile at baseline and at the end of the study.
The secondary objective 
(#5) is to evaluate the safety 
of Albuterol eMDPI.This secondary endpoint is the reporting of adverse events related to Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235583].
The safety endpoints for this study include the following for all 
patients in both groups:
!adverse event data
!adverse device effect data
Notes: The Digital System (DS) group will include eligible study population patients who will use the DS (eMDPI, 
App, DHP [Cloud solution], and dashboard) during the treatment period. The concurrent control (CC) group will 
include eligible patients who will be treated with their standard of care albuterol-administering rescue inhalers and will not use the DS during the treatment period. 
2.1.1. Justification of Primary Endpoint
Current asthma guidelines emphasize that asthma symptom control is a key therapeutic goal and 
recommend assessments of asthma control as a guide to step therapy. The ACT has been 
recommended by [CONTACT_52993] (NIH) as useful objective scoring system to measure asthma symptom control as a measure of core outcomes for both clinical trials and 
observational studies ( Cloutier et al 2012 ). ACT scores indicating poorer symptom control have 
been associated with higher risk of asthma exacerbations as well as asthma related health care 
resource utilization ( Ko et al 2012 ). In general, an ACT score of greater than 20 indicates well-
controlled asthma ( Nathan et al 2004 ) and the minimally important difference (MID) that 
represents a clinically significant change in ACT has been demonstrated to be 3 units ( Schatz et 
al 2009).

303. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram
This is a 12-week treatment, multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group comparison 
feasibility study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852], including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard, to optimize outcomes in patients at least [ADDRESS_285293] of a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), a 12-week open-label treatment 
period with Visit 2, and a follow-up telephone call (2 weeks following treatment completion).
Patients with suboptimal asthma control will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to 1 of 2 parallel groups stratified by [CONTACT_16940]: DS group patients utilizing the Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852], including inhaler, App, DHP (Cloud solution), and dashboard, and CC 
group patients who will be treated with their standard of care albuterol-administering rescue 
inhalers and will not use the DS during the treatment period. Similar data will be collected regarding outcomes for the CC group: ACT after [ADDRESS_285294] a screening/baseline visit (Visit 1), at which they will be asked if they use 
a smart device and use different applications on their smart devices. A baseline ACT score for all 
patients, and BMQ and BIPQ responses for patients 18 years of age or older, will be collected. 
Once randomized, patients in the DS group will be trained on the use of the Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852] (including instructions on how to use both the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235564]) and, upon demonstrating 
competency, will receive [ADDRESS_285295] 
their rescue treatment during the study. Additional Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235584], based on patients’ needs. Patients in the CC group will be 
reimbursed or given a voucher to use to purchase their existing rescue medications. 
Investigational centers will also receive similar instruction regarding features of the App, as well 
as features of the associated dashboard, which mirrors the digital information obtained from the 
eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235566], including frequency and times of SABA rescue use and associated inspi[INVESTIGATOR_235585].
The CC group will be followed according to the clinical judgment of the investigator; the asthma 
of patients in the CC group will be managed in a manner consistent with the clinical judgement 
of the investigator and based on asthma management guidelines (eg, GINA). Similar to the management of the CC group, the DS group patients will be followed by [CONTACT_235630] [INVESTIGATOR_235586], respectively. The iHCPs will check the dashboard at least once a week and use this information, as per their 
clinical judgment, to modify patients’ asthma management. Clinically Driven Assessments for 
both groups, if necessary, should be arranged per the clinical judgement of the iHCP managing the patient and can be via a telephone call or an on-site visit.
For all patients, at Visit [ADDRESS_285296] answers to Asthma Management questions, including discussions regarding adherence, or inhaler technique, treatment adjustments, or additions of new treatments, including biologic 
medication usage. Additionally, in the case of a Clinically Driven Assessment (for patients in the

31DS group), the iHCP will be asked whether or not the contact [CONTACT_235637]. 
At the end of the treatment period (12 weeks), final assessments of the DS and CC group patients 
will be made, as specified in Table [ADDRESS_285297] 
returned to previous asthma treatments.
It should also be noted that no specific clinical decisions are being mandated. One secondary 
objective of this study is to describe how clinicians actually use the information provided by [CONTACT_16943].

The study may be terminated by [CONTACT_23496]. For example, the 
sponsor should terminate the study in the event of the following:
!new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safety issues invalidate the earlier positive benefit-risk assessment
!discontinuation of the development of the IMP or device
If the whole study is stopped, patients who are terminated early will be followed according to 
Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient (Section 4.3).

36f. The patient is currently being treated with systemic corticosteroids (oral, 
intramuscular, or intravenous) or has been treated within the last 30 days. 
g. [Revision 1] The patient has any treatment with biologics for asthma (eg, 
omalizumab, anti-interleukin (IL) 5, anti-IL5R, anti-IL4R), or has had such treatment 
within the last 90 days. (However, during the study, patients can be escalated to 
therapy with such agents if clinically indicated in the judgment of the investigator as 
part of their asthma management and remain in the study.)
h. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to any components of the IMPs stated in this 
protocol. 
i. [New criterion] The patient has previously participated in a Digihaler study or is 
currently being treated prior to enrollment with a digital inhaler system, including the 
Digihaler system or an external “bolt on” digital system designed to monitor inhaler 
usage, such as the Propeller Health or Adherium systems.
4.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient
Each patient is free to withdraw from the study or discontinue from IMP or using the devices at 
any time, without prejudice to their continued care. Patient must be withdrawn from the study if 
any of the following events occur:
1. Patient withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the IMP or withdrawal from 
the study for any reason.
2. Patient develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued participation.
3. Patient is noncompliant with the study procedures and assessments or administration of 
Albuterol eMDPI, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
4. Patient takes prohibited concomitant medications as defined in this protocol (ie, other 
SABA products). 
5. The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient.6. Patient experiences an adverse event or other medical condition which indicates to the 
investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient.
Patients should be treated with standard of care after withdrawal from or termination of the study 
as appropriate.
Investigators should attempt to obtain information on patients in the case of withdrawal from the 
study or discontinuation from IMP. Results of any evaluations and observations, together with a 
narrative describing the reason(s) for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP, must be recorded in the source documents. The case report form (CRF) must document the 
primary reason for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP.
See Appendix E for information regarding how the study will define and address patients who 
are lost to follow-up to help limit the amount and impact of missing data.
If the reason for withdrawal from the study or discontinuation from IMP is an adverse event 
and/or adverse device effect, monitoring will be continued as applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a healthcare professional, or until 
9HUVLRQ   

37a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The specific event 
or test result (including repeated test results, as applicable) must be recorded both on the source 
documentation and in the CRF; the adverse events page and/or adverse device effect page and 
the termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The investigator must inform the contract research organization (CRO) as soon as possible of each patient who is being considered 
for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or discontinues IMP for multiple reasons that include 
adverse events, the relevant page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to 
an adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_235587] a prohibited medication, thereby [CONTACT_16957]. In 
such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be “need to take a prohibited medication,” not 
the adverse event.
In the case of patients lost to follow-up, attempts to contact [CONTACT_11333]’s medical records and transcribed to the CRF.
All assessments should be performed according to the protocol for the end of treatment visit or 
upon early termination if possible. Patients are required to return the Albuterol eMDPI (used and 
unused) upon withdrawal from the study.
4.4. Replacement of Patients
A patient who is enrolled but does not complete the treatment period will not be replaced.
4.5. Rescreening
A patient who is screened but not enrolled within 7 days of screening, because he/she did not 
satisfy inclusion/exclusion criteria or enrollment did not occur within the specified time, may be 
considered for rescreening once if, for example, there is a change in the patient’s medical 
background or a modification of study inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Patients may have individual parameters retested at the discretion of both the investigator and the 
sponsor.
If the patient is rescreened, the informed consent form (ICF) will need to be re-signed.
4.6. Screening Failure
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently enrolled in the study. Minimal information includes, but is not limited to, 
demography, screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse events.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_285305] IMP. The 3 investigational medical devices are the following:
Device 2: Patient-facing App
Device 3: DHP (Cloud solution) 
Device 4: Provider-facing dashboard
At Visit 1, patients in the DS group will be trained on the use of the Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16852] 
(including instructions on how to use both the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235564]) and, upon demonstrating 
competency, will receive [ADDRESS_285306] their rescue treatment during the study. Additional Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235565], based on patients’ needs. Patients will be instructed to return all 
inhalers to the investigational center at the end of treatment visit or at early termination. 
5.1.1. Test Investigational Medicinal Product
Albuterol eMDPI (marketed in the US as PROAIR DIGIHALER) is an inhalation-driven eMDPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_16907] a blend of albuterol sulfate and alpha-lactose monohydrate. The inhaler contains 
200 actuations, each delivering 90 mcg of albuterol base ex-mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]; the inhaler is equipped with a dose counter that shows only even numbers and counts down to “0.”
The plastic inhaler comprises a reservoir containing inhalation powder, a metering system, a 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_16908], and an eModule sitting on top of the drug-delivery compartment. Teva has developed the eModule as part of a system to assist a patient with asthma to 
appropriately use the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16876]. The system is described in more practical terms as an 
inhaler with an integrated data logger capable of storing and transmitting timestamped data to support the data logging functionality.
The on-board electronics and power source are fully integrated into the eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235588], ie, the battery does not require replacement or recharging. 
The addition of the required electronics has no impact on the pharmaceutical performance of the 
inhaler or on the required user steps to take a dose. A schematic of the inhaler with the additional eModule is shown in Figure 3 .

39Figure 3: Current Inhaler (Left) Versus Inhaler with Additional Electronics Module 
(Right)
Additional details may be found in Table 4 and in the IB.
The information from the eModule may be transmitted wirelessly (Bluetooth Low Energy) to an 
App. From the App, data may be transmitted to the DHP, which consists of a Cloud solution, and 
then to a dashboard. This allows the patient and/or the caregiver to track when and how well the inhaler was used.
By [CONTACT_16958], the patient must also download the smart device App (with 
the assistance of investigational center personnel), accept the smart device App’s Privacy Notice and Terms of Use, and also agree to share his/her data to a provider-facing dashboard utilized by 
[CONTACT_235640]. An ICF will be provided to the patients which 
will elaborate, among other ways, Teva’s ways of use and storing of patient data collected through the smart device App. The patient will be entering into a direct contractual relationship 
with Teva which will govern, among other things, Teva’s rights to use and store patient data 
collected through the smart device App. If the patient does not accept the smart device App’s Privacy Notice and Terms of Use and does not also agree to share their data to the provider-
facing dashboard utilized by [CONTACT_235640], then the patient 
cannot enroll in the study. At the end of treatment/ET visit (Visit 2), investigational center personnel will remove the App from the patient’s smart device.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Starting Dose and Dose Levels
The prescribed dose will be 90 mcg, 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 to 6 hours, as needed. No dose 
escalations are planned.

405.1.2. Medical Devices
Instructions for medical device use are provided in the Study Pharmacy Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Application
The software App is a customer facing software/focused smart device application for patients 
using the Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235589]. The intention of the smart 
device App is to engage patients with asthma and/or COPD (and their caregivers) by [CONTACT_235641], raising awareness of medication use patterns, allowing users to self-assess 
their respi[INVESTIGATOR_118789] a daily basis, sharing information on local environmental 
conditions, and producing user reports to review their data over time.
The software consists of a smart device application compatible for iPhone operating systems 
(iOS) and Android operating systems that will store data locally on the patient’s smart device. 
The App will receive a patient’s inhaler use/event data automatically from the inhaler devices via Bluetooth on a smart device. The smart device camera will be used for scanning and pairing. 
This data will allow the patient to track their usage of medication, inhalation results, and self-
assessments related to their asthma and/or COPD. The App gets environment information for the specific location of the patient.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Teva Digital Health Platform (Cloud Solution)
The Teva DHP is a system that stores and transfers inhaler use/event data collected from the 
App. The Cloud solution automatically synchronizes with the App after events and/or at predetermined time periods/intervals. An internet connection to the smart device (eg, wireless or 
cellular phone network) is required in order for communication to be established between the 
App and the Cloud solution. The Cloud solution will not send any notifications to the App. The Cloud solution does not create, modify, or delete patient information.
Patient privacy will be maintained according to the laws and regulations, and patient identifiers 
will be substituted to maintain a patient’s privacy to reviewers of the data.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dashboard
The DHP may be used to provide patient-specific data to the iHCP via the dashboard, a secure 
web interface. The data available on the dashboard are the inhaler use data and patient 
self-assessments from the App. The patient has no interaction with the dashboard. Teva personnel will have no access to the dashboard.

5.2. Preparation, Handling, Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for 
IMPs
5.2.1. Storage and Security
The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMP received, and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of 
the IMP.
The IMP must be stored at room temperature (15°C to 25°C [59°F to 77°F]) and not exposed to 
extreme heat, cold, or humidity. The investigational center personnel are responsible for 
acknowledging receipt of the IMP using a Randomization and Trial Supply Management(RTSM) system.
5.2.2. Labeling
Supplies of IMP will be labeled according to the current International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice and will include any locally required statements.
5.2.3. Accountability
Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment and any 
applicable forms.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMP for initial distribution to 
patients and other study materials from the sponsor are correctly received, recorded, handled, and 
safely and properly stored in accordance with national and local regulations, and used in accordance with this protocol.

environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the 
labeled storage conditions or appropriate instructions with access limited to the investigator and authorized personnel at the investigational center. The investigator (or designee) will instruct the 
patient to store the IMP according to the instructions on the label, if applicable; or will give 
instructions in an appropriate form. Patients will be instructed to return all IMP (empty, partially used, and unused inhalers) to the investigational center at end of treatment (Visit 2) or at the ET 
visit.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records). Patients will return all inhalers at the end of the 
study to the investigational center for reconciliation.
A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP and other study materials received, used, retained, and 
returned) must be prepared and signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], with an account 
given for any discrepancies. All empty, partially used, and unused inhalers will be collected at the end of the study and will be returned to the sponsor or designee per sponsor instructions.
Further guidance and information are provided in the Study Pharmacy Manual.
5.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Product
5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product
The prescribed dose of Albuterol eMDPI (now US FDA approved as PROAIR DIGIHALER) 
used in this study (ie, 90 mcg, 1 to 2 inhalations every 4 to 6 hours, as needed) was selected 
based on the prescribing information for PROAIR DIGIHALER.
PROAIR DIGIHALER is indicated for the management of asthma and relief of acute symptoms 
of asthma in adults and children 4 years and older, and for the prevention of EIB. For the relief 
of acute asthma symptoms, PROAIR DIGIHALER is recommended at a dosage of 2 inhalations 
(ie, 180 mcg of albuterol base ex-mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]) repeated every [ADDRESS_285309] disease.
5.4. Treatment After the End of the Study
No treatment is planned by [CONTACT_16962]. Patients are advised to consult with their primary physician for treatment.
5.5. Restrictions
There are no additional restrictions beyond the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study and the prohibited medication noted in Section 5.6.

435.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy
Any concomitant medication a patient is taking at screening and up to the final visit will be 
recorded on the CRF. Trade name [CONTACT_118836] (if available), 
indication, dose, and start and end dates of the administered medication will be recorded. The 
sponsor will encode all medication according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary (WHO Drug).
The use of other SABA products, by [CONTACT_16963], is prohibited during this study except for the 
use of nebulized albuterol, as needed, in the ED for an acute exacerbation of asthma. 
At the end of treatment visit (Visit 2), patients will be asked whether they have taken any 
medications (other than IMP), including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal or 
nutritional supplements, since the previous visit.
Concomitant medication and treatment will be recorded through the final visit.
5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance
Since the IMP is a rescue medication, it will be used on an “as needed” basis. The investigator 
will be responsible for dispensing IMP, training patients on the correct use of IMP, return of 
IMP, and IMP accountability records will be completed.
If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study 
protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be 
withdrawn from the study.
Exposure to IMP will be assessed as required.
5.8. Randomization and Blinding
This is an open-label study and patients will be randomly assigned to the DS group or CC group 
in a 1:1 ratio stratified by [CONTACT_16940], using a RTSM system. Since this an open-label study, blinding is not applicable.
5.9. Data Monitoring Committee
There will be no Data Monitoring Committee for this study.

Parallel-group, Controlled Study - Asthma
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_285310] is scored on a 5-point scale, with summation of all items providing scores ranging from 5 to 25. The scores 
span the continuum of poor control of asthma (score of 5) to complete control of asthma (score 
of 25), with a cutoff score of 19 and below indicating patients with poorly controlled asthma (Schatz et al 2006 ). 
The ACT should be the first questionnaire completed by [CONTACT_16964] a study visit (the second should be the BMQ, and the third the BIPQ (both by [CONTACT_1962] 18 years of age or older), and should precede any discussion between the patient and investigational center personnel. The 
self-administered version of the ACT will be answered by [CONTACT_235642] 1, Visit 2, or at the Early Termination (ET) visit. The investigators and personnel will be provided with detailed instructions for administering the ACT in order to achieve 
maximum compliance in a clinical study environment and maximum data quality. Caregivers or 
investigational center personnel will not be allowed to interfere or communicate with the patient completing the questionnaire beyond restating the question(s) on the questionnaire exactly as 
they have been written. After completion of the ACT, investigational center personnel will check 
the questionnaires for completeness and legibility. Detailed instructions for administering, scoring, and analyzing the ACT are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
6.1.2. Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire
The BMQ is used to assess cognitive representations of medicine ( Horne, Weinman, and 
Hankins 1999 ). The BMQ-Specific (BMQ-S11) is an 11-item questionnaire that assesses 
representation of medication prescribed for personal use and the BMQ-General assesses beliefs 
about medicines in general. For the purposes of this study, the BMQ-S11 will be completed by 
[CONTACT_1962], [ADDRESS_285311].
6.1.3. Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire
The BIPQ is a 9-item questionnaire designed to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_235590] ( Broadbent et al 2006 ). The BIPQ uses a single-item scale approach to 
assess perception on a 0-[ADDRESS_285312] summarizes the items contained in each subscale of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised which has over 80 items. The BIPQ comprises 5 items on cognitive representation of illness

treatment control item can be replaced by a particular treatment such as 'surgery' or 'physiotherapy' ( Broadbent et al 2006 ). The discriminant validity of the questionnaire is 
supported by [CONTACT_235643], namely asthma, diabetes, colds, myocardial infarct prior to discharge, and pre-diagnosis chest pain patients waiting stress exercise testing. The BIPQ will be answered by [CONTACT_13935], [ADDRESS_285314] 
questionnaire completed during a study visit following the BMQ.
6.1.4. System Usability Questionnaire
The SUS will be used to explore device acceptability and usability for patients in the DS group. 
It is a 10-question tool that provides a composite measure of the overall usability of the system 
being studied. It has been used extensively across many industries, patient types, and technologies, and has been used in studies of patients with asthma and COPD ( Brooke 1996). 
The SUS will be answered by [CONTACT_16966], [ADDRESS_285315] will be completed by [CONTACT_235644].

7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in patients or clinical investigation 
subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related (causal relationship) to 
the pharmaceutical product (treatment), investigational medical device, or comparator. This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this 
definition is restricted to events related to investigational medical devices. 
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or 
laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study or of any concurrent disease. A new condition 
or the worsening of a pre-existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study entry and do not worsen during this
study will not be considered adverse events.
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following:
!intercurrent illnesses
!physical injuries
!events possibly related to concomitant medication
!significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre-existing conditions
!drug/drug, drug/device, or device/device interactions
!events occurring during diagnostic procedures of this study
Worsening of asthma that occurs during the study that is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_16914]’s daily 
symptoms or leads to the patient’s discontinuation will be considered an adverse event. 
A CAE will be defined by 1 of the following: 1) in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16915], 
2) emergency treatment because of asthma, 3) a worsening of asthma symptoms leading to the 
use of prednisone or systemic corticosteroids for 3 days or more, or 4) a reduction in FEV
1of 
20% or greater. Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_235645] a CAE.

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study ABS-AS-[ZIP_CODE]
47All CAE events require documentation by [CONTACT_16970], as well 
as in the adverse event CRF. All evaluations entered into the CAE Page require the 
investigational center to obtain source documentation of all CAEs that occur during the treatment 
period to confirm the accuracy of the information obtained from the patient. Any CAE that meets serious adverse event criteria will be reported as a serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
For recording of an adverse event, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period 
from signature [CONTACT_17007]-up period (end of study [follow-up telephone call]). The period for reporting treatment-emergent adverse events is defined as the period after 
the first dose of IMP is administered and until the end of the follow-up period. 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded both on the 
source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or judged relationship 
to the IMP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed, and 
the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). The investigator 
does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events after the defined period.
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events by [CONTACT_23501]-ended question such as “Have you had any unusual symptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the 
serious adverse event form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a 
healthcare professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made.
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF.
The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study procedures, and the severity and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by [CONTACT_093], must be recorded as described below.
Further details are given in the Safety Monitoring Plan.

Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product
The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as follows ( Table 5 ):
Table 5: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal 
Product
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility(not related)This category applies to adverse events that, after careful consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:
!It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the IMP.
!It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
!It does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP.
!It does not reappear or worsen when the IMP is re-administered.
Reasonable possibility(related)This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection 
with the administration of IMP 
cannot be ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply:
!It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP.
!It cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11347]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
!It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after discontinuation of the 
IMP, yet an IMP relationship clearly exists.
!It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.
IMP=investigational medicinal product.
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
For recording of a serious adverse event, the study period is defined for each patient as that time 
period from signature [CONTACT_17007]-up period. Serious adverse events 
occurring in a patient after the end of the follow-up period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions:
!results in death
!is a life-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe
!requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28366], or that they occurred as a consequence of the event
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11295], unless there was worsening of the pre-existing condition during the patient’s participation in this study.
!results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
!is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
!an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any 
suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event.
All occurrences of possible drug-induced liver injury that meet Hy’s law criteria, defined as all
of the below, must be reported by [CONTACT_16971] a serious adverse event:
!alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increase of >3x the upper limit 
of normal (ULN)
!total bilirubin increase of >2x ULN
!absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline phosphatase)
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safety information (RSI) by [CONTACT_16972], severity, outcome, or frequency is 
considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study is the IB.

50The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) will determine the 
expectedness for all serious adverse events.
For the purpose of suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) reporting, the 
version of the IB at the time of occurrence of the S[LOCATION_003]R applies.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy regulatory requirements, all serious adverse events that occur during the study, 
regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported to the sponsor 
by [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported within [ADDRESS_285317] administration of IMP of that patient 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them .
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer (LSO) or designee (a 
CRO in a country without a sponsor LSO) (contact [CONTACT_235646]); the LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s GPSP.
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely:
!study number
!investigator and investigational center identification

∀autopsy findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_142917], study 
procedures, and to underlying disease.
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of when it becomes known to 
the same address as the initial report.
For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations 
of Medical Sciences form/MedWatch form/Extensible Markup Language file to the LSO/CRO 
for submission to the competent authorities, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review 
Board (IEC/IRB), and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, 
the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored 
clinical studies of Albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_16916] (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate).
In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other action may be required, including the following:
!altering existing research by [CONTACT_23504]
!discontinuing or suspending the study
!modifying the existing consent form and informing all study participants of new 
findings
!modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as related to Albuterol eMDPI
7.1.6. Protocol-Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest
No protocol-defined adverse events of special interest were identified for this study. 
7.1.7. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case-by-case basis. To ensure patient safety, after the event has stabilized or 
treatment has been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must contact [CONTACT_235647]

Parallel-group, Controlled Study - Asthma
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_285318] Reporting
Adverse device effects ( Figure 4) must be recorded on both the source documentation and the 
CRF. 
All adverse device effects shall be reviewed by [CONTACT_093], the medical monitor, and the 
sponsor. The investigator and sponsor will record all relevant information regarding every 
adverse device effect/serious adverse device effect and device deficiency and will categorize 
each as guided in Section 7.2.
The investigator should make an initial determination whether the adverse event may be related 
to a device deficiency. 
Adverse device effects and device deficiencies will be listed in the clinical study report (CSR).
7.2.2. Serious Adverse Device Effects
A serious adverse device effect is an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect is a serious adverse device effect that, by [CONTACT_47720], incidence, severity, or outcome, has not been listed in Appendix F (Appendix Table 1 and 
Appendix Table 2 ).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Device Effect Reporting
The investigator will report to the sponsor, without unjustified delay, all serious adverse device 
effects (within 24 hours); this information shall be promptly followed by [CONTACT_235648].
The process and contact [CONTACT_16975] [IP_ADDRESS].
Events shall be reported to the IEC/IRB by [CONTACT_235649].
The investigator should use Appendix F (Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Table 2) to make an 
initial determination whether the serious adverse event may be related to a device deficiency.

7.3. Pregnancy
All pregnancies of women participating in the study, that occur during the study, or within at 
least [ADDRESS_285319] provide the sponsor (LSO/CRO) with the completed pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for 
reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between 
screening and baseline, provided no protocol-related procedures were applied.
All female patients participating in the study who become pregnant will be monitored for the 
outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or voluntary abortion). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including 
details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal 
and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after 
withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as 
appropriate.
Since there is no evidence of teratogenicity, genotoxicity, fetotoxicity, or spermatotoxicity for 
this IMP, female partners will not be required to sign an ICF to monitor the outcome of the 
pregnancy.
If the pregnancy in the woman participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the 
following actions will be taken:

!For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
!For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an adverse event.
7.4. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Product
Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported 
in the patient’s source documents ( Appendix C ), regardless of whether or not an adverse event 
occurs as a result.
The following are types of medication errors and special situations:
1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, 
patient, or consumer.
2. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration 
or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of IMP (whether the test IMP or reference IMP), whether taken intentionally or 
unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed, must be immediately reported to the 
sponsor.
3. Misuse: Situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in 
accordance with the authorized product information.
4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which is accompanied by 
[CONTACT_3584].
5. Occupational exposure: Exposure to an IMP as a result of one’s professional or 
nonprofessional occupation.
7.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests
No clinical laboratory tests are scheduled to be performed during this study.
7.6. Physical Examinations
No physical examinations are scheduled to be performed during this study.
7.7. Vital Signs
Vital signs (blood pressure [systolic/diastolic], pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be measured 
at the time points detailed in Table 3 . All vital signs results outside of the reference ranges will 
be judged by [CONTACT_28454] 1 of the following categories:
!abnormal and not clinically significant

Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 04 Study ABS-AS-[ZIP_CODE]
55!abnormal and clinically significant
Before blood pressure and pulse are measured, the patient must rest in a seated position for at 
least 5 minutes. The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. For any abnormal vital sign value, the measurement should be repeated as soon 
as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by [CONTACT_235650], and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2.
In addition, potentially clinically significant values will be predefined by [CONTACT_235651].
7.8. Electrocardiography
No electrocardiogram measurements are scheduled to be performed during this study.

579. STATISTICS
This section describes the statistical analysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study. 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analyses will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. After finalization of the Statistical Analysis Plan, any additional analyses or 
changes to analyses that may be required will be fully disclosed in the CSR.
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations
Sample size estimates are based upon the assumption that the absolute differences between the DS and CC groups and the associated operational characteristics will be similar to the absolute 
differences and operational characteristics of the DS and CC groups noted in the sample size 
rationale for the study design.
The recommended sample size for the study is 150 evaluable patients per group 
([ADDRESS_285320] 10 patients), 
300 patients in total. Accounting for a dropout rate of 10%, this leads to a recommended total number of 330 enrolled patients.
With this sample size and assuming a true absolute difference in proportions (treatment effect as 
the estimated response rate for the CC group is 60% and for the DS group is 73%) between the groups of at least 13%, the probability that the posterior probability will be at least 95% is 0.77 
(power) (analogous to 1-sided p-value < 0.05) ( Merchant et al 2016 ). Assuming no treatment 
effect (difference in proportions between the groups is 0%, ie, Type 1 error) then the probability 
is 0.[ADDRESS_285321] 95% is 0.05.
It should be noted that both power and Type 1 error are dependent on the absolute difference
between the DS and the CC groups as illustrated in Figure 5 below by [CONTACT_235633]:

589.2. Analysis Sets
9.2.1. Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomized patients. In the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were 
randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received. This analysis population will 
be used for summarization of patient disposition and demographic and baseline characteristics, as appropriate.
9.2.2. Modified Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set is a subset of the ITT analysis set including only 
patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP (IMP is albuterol eMDPI [INVESTIGATOR_235570]-of-care albuterol-administering rescue medication for the CC group) and at least 
1 postbaseline assessment on any of the study endpoints (primary, secondary, or exploratory). 
In the mITT analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients 
were randomized, regardless of which treatment they actually received. This analysis will be 
used for all primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoint analyses. 
9.2.3. Safety Analysis Set
This analysis set will include all patients in the DS group who receive at least 1 dose of IMP and 
all patients in the CC group. In the safety analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the 
treatment patients actually received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized, 
unless otherwise specified. This analysis set will be used for all safety analyses.
Additional analyses sets may be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan, if appropriate.
9.3. Data Handling Conventions
For all variables, only the observed data from the patients will be used in the statistical analyses, 
ie, there is no plan to estimate (impute) missing data, unless otherwise specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
9.3.1. Handling Withdrawals and Missing Data
For the primary endpoint, missing data will not be imputed, unless otherwise specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.
9.4. Study Population
The ITT Analysis Set (Section 9.2.1) will be used for all study population summaries noted 
below, unless otherwise specified. Summaries will be presented for all patients.
9.4.1. Patient Disposition
Data from patients screened; patients screened but not randomized and reason for not being 
randomized; patients in the ITT analysis set; patients in the ITT analysis set who did not attempt to download the App; patients in the ITT analysis set who did not use the inhaler; patients in the 
mITT and safety analysis sets; patients who completed the study; and patients who withdrew

59from the study and the reason for withdrawal will be summarized using descriptive summary 
statistics (number, %).
9.4.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical history, current medication 
at screening/baseline, and treatment history related to asthma, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient 
counts and percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary. This will be based on the ITT analysis population.
9.5. Analyses
9.5.1. Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients reaching well-controlled asthma as defined by 
[CONTACT_16979] [ADDRESS_285322] score from baseline at the end of 
the 12-week treatment period (responder analysis of DS versus CC group with responders 
defined by [CONTACT_16979] [ADDRESS_285323] score).
9.5.2. Secondary Endpoints
Secondary endpoint #1 is the frequency and types of interventions done to improve asthma 
control including:
!number of discussions between patient and iHCP regarding inhaler technique or 
adherence
!number of adjustments of therapy including:
oincreased or decreased doses of inhaled medication
ochange to different inhaled medication
oadditional inhaled medication
oaddition of a systemic corticosteroid medication for asthma or another controller, including a LAMA or biologics
!frequency of intervention to manage comorbid conditions associated with poor asthma control GERD, sinusitis, etc.)
Secondary endpoint #2 is the change from baseline in the mean weekly SABA usage and the 
change from baseline in the number of SABA-free days over the 12-week treatment period for 
the DS group.
Secondary endpoint #3 is the assessment of the DS (eMDPI, App and dashboard) acceptability 
and usability, utilizing the SUS, completed by [CONTACT_16938], 18 years of age or 
older, and investigational center personnel at the end of the study.

9.5.4. Planned Method of Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Analysis
To analyze the primary variable, the following estimand framework will be used:
1. 1. Analysis will be performed on the mITT set. 
2. A binary distribution is assumed for the primary endpoint. Patients who discontinue early 
due to technology failure, disliking the digital platform, disease worsening, adverse 
experience or disliking the IMP will be counted as treatment failures For those who discontinue early not due to these reasons, the ACT value assessed at the ET visit will be 
used.
3. Summary measure: A successful differentiation between the 2 groups will be determined 
by a Bayesian posterior probability for  
 >0 greater than 0.95 (1-sided). The following 
statistical methods will be utilized:
Logistic regression model allowing for different response rates at enrolling investigational 
centers will be used for testing the hypothesis   :  =0,   :  >0in the following model:
     
1−   =  +                   +     
where i = treatment group, j = investigational center, x ij= treatment group i for investigational 
center j, pij= response proportion of treatment group i in investigational center j. 
Non-informative priors will be assumed for all coefficients.
Estimates of odds ratio and individual proportions with corresponding credible intervals will be 
presented.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity Analysis
If appropriate, sensitivity analyses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

6716. SUMMARY OF CHANGES TO PROTOCOL
16.1. Amendment 04 Dated 12 March 2021
The primary reason for this amendment is to add an exclusion criterion to preclude patients with 
previous exposure to the Digihaler device from participating in the study. This amendment is considered to be substantial (ie, requires approval by [CONTACT_28474], IEC, and/or IRB) by [CONTACT_456]’s 
Authorized Representative. Other nonsubstantial changes have been made to the protocol (and 
protocol synopsis, as appropriate). These changes are unlikely to affect the safety or rights (physical or mental integrity) of the patients in this clinical study or the scientific value of the 
clinical study.
Minor editorial changes (typos, punctuation, replacing text with abbreviations, etc) have been 
made to the protocol and protocol synopsis, as appropriate.

Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations
Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_11390]/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) and national and local competent authorities, 
as applicable, except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the patients or 
when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16932], the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the 
sponsor will sign the protocol amendment.
Protocol Deviations
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or 
mental integrity of the patients in the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Protocol deviations may include nonadherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines; noncompliance 
to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration; or use of prohibited medications. Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded by [CONTACT_235692]. All protocol deviations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required.
When a protocol deviation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to withdraw the 
patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval 
from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and 
preserving the integrity of the study.
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectively granted by 
[CONTACT_456]. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol deviation. If such patient has already completed the study or has 
withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded.
Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all personnel members 
involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and 
during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must ensure that all study personnel are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to perform 
their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary.
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol.

conducted according to applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines.
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the study to ensure that there is adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely 
recorded and reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before 
they participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with IEC/IRB approvals.
The study monitor(s) will contact [CONTACT_28505]. The study monitor will be permitted to review and verify the various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source 
documents relating to the study) to verify adherence to the protocol and to ensure the 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded.
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, 
accompany the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow-up written communication.
In case of an emergency situation (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic), where study monitors may not 
be able to access the investigational centers for on-site visits, investigational centers will be 
monitored remotely, where allowed, and in accordance with local regulations.
Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global 
Clinical Quality Assurance, independent of Global Specialty Development, is responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit.
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct 
inspections and audits to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.
In case of an emergency situation (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic), where auditors may not be able 
to access the investigational centers for on-site visits, investigational centers will be monitored 
remotely, where allowed, and in accordance with local regulations.

Parallel-group, Controlled Study - Asthma
Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_285392] Complaints/Device Deficiency 
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical 
quality or characteristics of clinical IMP supplies or clinical device supplies used in a clinical 
research study sponsored by [CONTACT_16956]. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limited to:
!suspected contamination
!questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc)
!defective components
!missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center 
with more or less than the designated number of units inside)
!incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
!unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both
!device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by [CONTACT_235694] [EMAIL_204] within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device/combination product or other retrievable item, it is required 
that the device/combination product (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of 
the patient’s IMP supply) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever 
possible.
Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide 
the following information, as available:
!investigational center number and principal investigator [CONTACT_2300]
!name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint
!clinical protocol number
!patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable
!product name [CONTACT_17009]-label studies

118!description or nature of complaint
!associated serious adverse event: Yes/No
!clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies): Yes/No
!date and name [CONTACT_11415]: Reporting a product complaint must not be delayed even if not all the required information 
can be obtained immediately. Known information must be reported immediately. The sponsor 
will collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information.
Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) and Devices at the Investigational 
Center(s)
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP.
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all IMP or devices, the sponsor will 
provide the information needed to handle the return.
A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality problem existing beyond the scope 
of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient, if 
applicable.
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol 
should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2 and Section [IP_ADDRESS], respectively).
Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, 
the initial determination whether the deficiency could have led to a serious adverse event 
(Section II), and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the 
patient. Once the complaint has been investigated by [CONTACT_16998], if 
necessary, an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint 
originated or to all investigational centers using the product.
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported by [CONTACT_23528].
II. Assessment of Device Performance
Device performance will be assessed by [CONTACT_235674].
A device deficiency is defined as any inadequacy of an investigational medical device with 
respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance ( Appendix Figure 1). 
This definition includes malfunctions, use errors, inadequate labeling (eg, unintelligible label, 
incorrect expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695]), and product complaints that are related to the eMDPI.
The investigator should use Appendix Table [ADDRESS_285393] led to a serious adverse event and notify

equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF 
and considered as source data, unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly to the CRF.
If data are processed from other institutions or by [CONTACT_11174] (eg, clinical laboratory, central 
image center, or electronic diary data), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. 
These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data 
management).
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, IEC/IRB, and inspectors from competent 
authorities (or their agents) will be given direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical 
charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with national and local requirements.
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s data 
at all times. The investigator must maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the unambiguous identification of each patient.
Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11 (US) and documents of other concerned 
competent authorities. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully validated and all users will receive training on the system and study-specific training. After they are trained, users will be 
provided with individual system access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by [CONTACT_23529], and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF.
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central 
image center, electronic diary data, electronic patient-reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these 
data will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to 
the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). All patient data must have supportive 
original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed 
to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data, unless the sponsor provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded 
directly to the CRF.
For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screening 
failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered in the CRF.

Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency of the data from this study. Oversight will be carried out as described in the 
sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies. Day to day data management tasks for this study are delegated to a contract organization, and these functions may be carried out as described in the 
SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_17000].
Data will be verified by [CONTACT_66020], and reviewed by [CONTACT_28509]. Data identified as 
erroneous, or data that are missing, will be referred to the investigational center for resolution through data queries. Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data 
review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be 
compared with the information available in the CDMS and any discrepancies will be queried.
Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study.
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data have been captured and confirmed as accurate. All data collected will be approved by [CONTACT_17002]. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review 
and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.

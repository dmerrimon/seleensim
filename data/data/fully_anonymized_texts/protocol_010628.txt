1.1 SYNOPSIS   
 
Title:  Project STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine  Access for Medication -
assisted Intervention Through NAvigation): Development and Testing of 
a Health Navigation Approach for Linking Syringe Service Program 
Clients to Medication Assisted Treatment  
 
Grant Number:   
Not applicable (the funder does not use grant numbers)  
 
Study Description:  
This clinical trial  utilizes two study arms: (1) a treatment arm consisting 
of immediate telemedicine linkage and (2) a control arm consisting of standard referral to treatment. Half of the study participants are  
randomly enrolled in  each arm. The study utilizes  questionnaire data, 
drug test results, and administrative treatment data at multiple time points to determine what effect telemedicine linkage has on clients in 
relation to the comparison group. The primary  hypothesis is that (1) 
STAMINA will be more effective  at impro ving MOUD linkage than 
standard referral.  Secondary hypotheses are: (2) the STAMINA 
participants  will have greater MOUD engagement than participants  
who receive standard referral; (3) STAMINA participants  
will have greater MOUD retention than participants who  
receive standard referral; (4) STAMINA participants will have used less illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_552415] -up than participants  
who received standard referral.  
 
Objectives*: 
  
The primary goal of this project is to establish effectiveness of a 
telemedicine approach for linking syringe exchange clients to

Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental Manipulation:  Participants in the telemedicine linkage intervention are immediately 
linked to telemedicine care with a physician waivered to prescribe medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD). The physician completes  a 
virtual appointment, provide s personalized care, and has the ability to 
prescribe MOUD  that fits the patient’s preferences and needs . 
Depending on the outcome of the telemedicine appointment, the participants is offered immediate transportation via ride share 
assistance to complete the initial steps related to their MOUD  (i.e., pi[INVESTIGATOR_552419] a pharmacy , attend a  
methadone intake appointment , or receive an initial vivitrol injection ).

*Data are pulled at a single  time point and reflect  the [ADDRESS_726089] STAMINA (Syringe Service Telemedicine Access for Medication -Assisted Intervention through 
Navigation) is a research study aiming to test the effectiveness of a linkage intervention that connects 
people with an OUD to MOUD using telehealth in a syringe service program (SSP) setting. STAMINA wa s 
conceptualized as a way to utilize a setting that is familiar to patients with an OUD to offer rapid access 
to care while removing barriers related to comfort.  
 The primary hypothesis is that (1) STAMINA will be more effective at improving MOUD linkage than standard referral. Secondary hypotheses are: (2) the STAMINA participants will have  greater MOUD 
engagement than participants  who receive standard referral; (3) STAMINA participants  will have greater 
MOUD retention than participants who  receive standard referral; (4) STAMINA  participants will  have 
used less illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_552415] -up than participants  who received standard referral.

  02/17/[ADDRESS_726090] 16 years, leading to an 
unprecedented rise in mortality rates [1, 2, 3]. Efforts to reverse these trends and reduce overdoses and 
associated fatalities have included expansion of m edication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]. This includes 
Methadone, Suboxone®, and Vivitrol®, which have all been shown to improve recovery [4]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_552421], people who use opi[INVESTIGATOR_552422] g wait lists or lack of insurance that prevent immediate intake at a time when the patient 
is ready [5]. Syringe service programs (SSPs)  are an excellent setting for linking those with an OUD to 
care , as they are judgement -free areas where people who use opi[INVESTIGATOR_552423] [6]. SSPs have also already been demonstrated to lead 
to significant improvements in a number of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -use related outcomes such as reduced 
transmission of com municable diseases (e.g., HIV ), costs associated with treating them, and linkage to 
recovery -oriented services.  Further,  telemedicine will provide a way to immediately connect patients to 
a provider, thus eliminating the window between referral and appointment time where many patients 
are lost to treatment [6].  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 The primary risks to participants of this study are (a) breaches of privacy  (i.e., others would learn that 
participants are receiving treatment for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]) and (b) breaches of  confidentiality ( i.e., 
others would know the information obtained during data collection ), which  could result  in stigma or 
criminal prosecution if it were discovered that the participant is an illegal opi[INVESTIGATOR_113037]. Additional risks to 
participants include (c) the possibility that they feel uncomfortable sharing information about 
themselves related to their current drug use or history with drug use and treatment, criminal justice 
involvement, or child welfare involvement  or that (d) the questions may cause participants distress, 
particularly as these instruments include multiple items regarding sensitive issues.  
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 The possible benefits that participants might gain are (a) the opportunity to discuss and reflect on their recent experiences and (b) the opportunity to inform research that may lead to the future development of improved linkage to treatment for individuals with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].  
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 The collection of sensitive data (e.g., data  pertaining to illicit drug use) and identifiable data is necessary 
to assess the proposed outcomes and examine the effect of the telemedicine  linkage intervention. Study 
procedures aim to minimize risks associated with the collection of these data through the following 
ways: (a) all data collected during participant interactions (i.e., structured interviews and drug screens) 
will be entered directly into Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to ensure secure data storage that is HIPPA compliant and that  that only relevant research team members have access to this 
Project STAMINA  
Protocol 138- 0420   Version 11  
  02/17/2022  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 8 information; (b) all administrative MOUD treatment data and vital records data collected on participants 
will be stored in a HIPPA compliant Box  Health folder that only relevant research team members can 
access  or entered and stored in REDCap or ; (c) all paper forms used in the consent process will be 
temporarily  stored in a locked cabinet at the enrollment sites and then  transferred by [CONTACT_1758]’s 
Project Manager for long -term  (i.e., three years)  storage in a locked cabinet within the Principal 
Investigator’s office; (d) research staff will assure all participants throughout the structured interviews that they may choose to skip any questions they do not want to answer and will end the interview o r 
skip a question if a participant seems distressed about sharing the information requested.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Our primary long -term goal is to establish an effective telemedicine method for linking individuals with 
OUD to MOUD from the SSP. The primary hypothesis is that (1) STAMINA will be more effective at 
Project STAMINA  
Protocol 138- 0420   Version 11  
  02/17/[ADDRESS_726091] screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_552449]. If eligibility criteria are met,  the research assistant completes the informed 
consent process  and obtains a signature [CONTACT_21525] . Participants are subsequently assigned to one of 
two study arms using randomization with stratification by [CONTACT_552450] a strong preference for methadone treatment, which is determined during the eligibility screening.  Study 
arms include: (1)  the intervention arm, in which participants are immediately linked to telemedicine care 
with a physician waivered to prescribe medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_552425] (2) the control 
arm, in which participants receive a standard referral to an in -person appointment -as would normally 
happen in the SSP sites .  
 To randomize participants , an offsite research assistant is immediately alerted of the new enrollment 
and informed of their  medication preference, checks the pre- established randomization lists, and 
requests a telemedicine appointment when applicable . Meanwhi le, the onsite research assistant  
responsible for enrolling the participant  conducts all baseline data collection, including a structured 
interview and urine drug screen. At the completion of baseline data collection, the onsite research assistant and participant are informed of the study arm assignment and move forward with completing 
or sch eduling the appropriate appointment type.  
 
For participants of the intervention arm, the research assistant prepares the participant for their telemedicine  appointment, assists in completion  of the appointment , and offers a ride share for the 
participant to pi[INVESTIGATOR_552426]. For participants of the control arm, the research assistant schedules an in -person appointment  and offers bus passes for their first appointment.  
 Participants are asked to return to the study site to complete follow -up data collection, including 
another structured interview and urine drug screen, at 3 months.  
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
The control condition was defined in consultation with our SSP partner based on usual services they provide to clients they serve. Therefore, the control reflects real -world service options that would be 
available to participants outside of the study’s con ditions.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_552427] a control arm that is representative of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_450907] , it is difficult to 
identify to where SSP staff refer clients , as it is not ethical to require them to send patients to providers 
the research team has relationships with if they are not the best fit for the patient’s needs . Additionally, 
with the onset of the pandemic, and loosening of treatment regulations, many patients have  
telemedicine MOUD linkage options available to them that are  similar to the treatment condi tion (the 
study was conceived of and funded prior to the start of the COVID -19 pandemic, but data collection did 
not start until after) .

 10 4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
 
The telemedicine linkage intervention being tested in this study aims to provide a solution to access -
related barriers experienced by [CONTACT_552451][INVESTIGATOR_552428]. The rational for implementing telemedicine linkage within a syringe service program (SSP) is because these 
sites  are considered trusted setting s in which high -risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_552429]. It is important to note, the intervention was developed in collaboration w ith medical and SSP partners as a 
potential solution to access barriers existing prior to the loosening of telemedicine treatment 
regulations that occurred with the onset of the COVID -[ADDRESS_726092] permission to 
access the participant’s administrative health data, as  shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), Section 
1.3.

 11 5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Not applicable.  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not entered  
into the study because they do not meet the inclusion or exclusion criteria (i.e., failure of screening). If research staff learn that the information  provided by [CONTACT_552453] (for example, if a research staff member learns from a participant  during their baseline or 
follow -up assessment that they do not use opi[INVESTIGATOR_552430] a medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428]) then data collection will be discontinued, and the participant will be  excluded from the study. 
The patient will still be provided with the related study compensation for their  time.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 Strategies for Recruitment   Potential participants  will be recruited  one of the following ways: (1) individuals will see the STAMINA 
poster within the SSP service site and be able to ask SSP  staff where to get more information, (2) current 
syringe service clients will be able to inform staff that they are interested in treatment for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], and staff will inform them of the study opportunity , (3) individuals will see a STAMINA flyer at 
another social service program in the city or on social media platforms and be able to call study 
personnel for more information on the study, or ( 4) individuals will be introduced to the study by 
[CONTACT_552454].  Details on each method  of recruitment are provided below.  
 
(1 or 2) For individuals already on  site, any interested SSP client will be informed by [CONTACT_552455] a 
study possibility exists for individuals interested in medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_552431], the staff can introduce the client to the research personnel. They will utilize the SSP recruitment script to explain the study. With their verbal permission, 
they will be introduced to the research staff who can complete the full recruitment script, eligibility 
assessment, and enrollment process with a research assistant.  
 (3) For individuals offsite that see a flyer from another social service provider or through a social media 
platform , they will first briefly speak with a research assistant by [CONTACT_552456] -person time at SSP  to complete the full recruitment script, eligibility 
assessment, and enrollment process with a research assistant.  
 (4) Chestnut Health Systems’ Lighthouse Institute staff will utilize their street outreach procedures, 
during which they enter communities and engage community member s to inform people of the study 
opportunity. For STAMINA, the street outreach workers will stay within Chicago’s Austin and Humboldt Park neighborhoods since that is where our two SSP  study sites are located. The street outreach will (a) 
approach people in public areas, such as street corners, bus stops, and parks. They will then (b) implement the study recruitment script, which is written broadly enough that it does not assume the 
person they are approaching is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_552432], allows them to openly introduce the study 
Project STAMINA  
Protocol 138- 0420   Version 11  
  02/17/[ADDRESS_726095] outreach worker will then 
(c) assess for initial eligibility and (d) offer imme diate transportation back to the SSP  site. Once they 
arrive at SSP , they will meet with a study research assistant to complete the full recruitment script, 
eligibility assessment, and enrollment process.  
 
If an individual is at an SSP and is interested in participating in the study but does not have the available 
time that day or  does not feel ready to begin treatment that day, we will offer for them to sign a 
“Consent to Contact” form. The form will give us permission to contact [CONTACT_552457] -
weeks to see if they are interested in participating. If so, we will be able to schedule a time for them to 
come  in and complete the enrollment process. This will ensure that there is availability, and that the 
client has time in t heir schedule. This form will be offered but not required; they will only sign if 
interested.  
 Strategies for Retention   Regarding participant retention related to the follow -up data collection, research staff will make every 
effort to contact [CONTACT_552458] [ADDRESS_726096] information (details can be found under Section 8.1 
Endpoint and Non -Safety Assessments), as well as continuous attempts throughout the allowable 
follow -up window (i.e., 1 month prior the 3 -month due date -  2 months following the 3 -month due 
date).  
 Participant retention related to the intervention is not applicable , as it is left to the discretion of the 
participant whether they complete steps related to their MOUD care.  
 Participant Incentive  
 Participants will be compensated for both baseline data and follow -up data collection at the conclusion 
of each visit.  At baseline, participants will receive $50 for completing all study activities . At the 3 -month 
time point , participants will receive $25 for completing the questionnaire and an additional $[ADDRESS_726097] will be mailed to them at an address they provide.

 13 Intervention Arm (1):  Participants enrolled into the telemedicine linkage intervention will be 
immediately linked to telemedicine care with a physician waivered to prescribe MOUD  treatment. All 
enrollment and telemedicine care will occur at the University of Illinois  Chicago (UIC)'s School of Public 
Health's Community Outreach Intervention Project (COIP) SSP sites. On -site, the participant will have 
their vitals checked ( i.e., temperature, blood pressure) by a research team member and be connected 
with a Un iversity of Illinois (UI) Health Mile Square Health Center physician (Chicago, Illinois) via 
telemedicine linkage on a tablet computer . The research assistant will share the participant’s vitals with 
the physician, and the physician will complete a virtual appointment and assessment during which they 
will provide personalized care. Related to the appointment, the physician will make note s in the 
patient's electronic medical records of their treatment plan. The physician will have the ability to 
prescribe buprenorphine . Should the participant receive an induction  prescription for buprenorphine or 
naltrexone , it will be sent to  the Mile  Square Health Center (MSHC) pharmacy or a pharmacy of the 
participant’s choice . If the participant does not have medical insurance, the MSHC pharmacy will be able 
to assist with prescription costs. Additionally, the participant will be provided with instructions for how 
to locate the pharmacy on -site at the FQHC and how to complete induction steps.  
 
Depending on the MOUD preference and whether any medications are prescribed on the telemedicine visit, the research assistant will offer the participant transportation via ride share to complete their initial steps in the process  of beginning MOUD . If the participant is prescribed buprenorphine on the 
telemedicine visit, they will be provided with a rideshare to the pharmacy to pi[INVESTIGATOR_552433]. If 
the participant is referred to methadone, they will be provided with a ride share for their first in -person 
appointment for the methadone intake. If the participant is scheduled for a vivitrol injection, they will be provided with a rideshare to the pharmacy to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up any medication prescribed for injection 
preparation  or to their initial injection .  
 
All follow -up OUD care and prescribing will be conducted based on the provider’s standards and may 
include in -person or telemedicine appointments. Should the provider deem an in -person intake 
appointment clinically necessary for any participant assigned to  the treatment arm, the research 
assistant will provide a full- day bus pass to assist with transportation.  
 
Standard Care Arm (2):  Participants enrolled in the control arm will receive a standard referral to an in -
person appointment  with an MOUD provider , which will typi[INVESTIGATOR_380618] 24 -72 hours of the 
enrollment time, depending on provider and participant availability . Regarding scheduling, this will 
include  UI Health MSHC healthcare providers for participants interested in discussing their MOUD 
options, or who are open to receiving buprenorphine or vivitrol.  For participants who are strictly 
interested in  methadone, this will include UI Health MSHC’s Family Guidance methadone providers, 
additional Family Guidance methadone providers across Chicago, or another methadone provider with a location convenient to the participant . The research assistant will provide two  bus pass es to cover the 
transportation to and from the appointment.  
 All follow -up OUD care and prescribing will be conducted based on the provider’s standards and may 
include in -person or telemedicine appointments.

research assistants monthly. Any concerns or issues will be reviewed with the research assistant and 
corrected.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Participants will be assigned to one of the two study arms  (i.e., telemedicine  or standard in -person 
referrals) using randomization with stratification by [CONTACT_552459] a strong preference 
for methadone treatment. The reason for stratifying assignment  on this second condition is to avoid 
potential confounding of the results since methadone treatment might be administered by a different 
provider and would require different linkage procedures after the telemedicine call. Arm a llocation will 
be determined in advance  of enrollment by [CONTACT_552460] -established study identification numbers 
that will be sequentially assigned to participants as they are enrolled.  
 
To minimize bias during data collection, two research assistants (one offsite and one onsite) will share 
the enrollment responsibilities. During enrollment, the onsite research assistant will screen the client  for 
eligibility, which includes an assessment of the client’s interest in MOUD and determination of their 
preferred medication. Due to the need for scheduling a telemedicine  appointment at least [ADDRESS_726100] and 
schedule s a telemedicine  appointment when necessary. The offsite research assistant will inform the 
onsite research assistant of the arm assignment once  baseline  data collection is complete.

7 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DISCONTINUATION  AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 
This linkage intervention aims to connect participants to MOUD treatment, but  the completion of the 
telehealth appointment, in -person MOUD appointment (s), or accessing prescriptions is at the discretion 
of the participan t. Participants  may choose not to take part in the initial linkage appointment (i.e., 
telehealth or in -person) or to  adhere to any subsequent treatment -related activities  (e.g., prescription 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up, follow -up appointments) and still remain a participant of this study.  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY  
 Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  If a 
participant wishes to discontinue their involvement with the study or forgo follow -up data collection 
activities, they are able to notify any study team member or the IRB at any time to withdraw.  
 Investigators  may discontinue  a participant from  the study for the following reasons : 
• The participant  (a) does not meet an inclusion criterion or (b) meets an exclusion criterion 
(either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation . 
 
Withdrawal from the study will not adversely affect the participant. Participants are free to continue to receive their MOUD treatment or SSP services even if withdrawn. Should a participant withdraw, we will 
not request further data collection activities and will remove any existing data from the sample.  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded . Subjects who 
sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be 
replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form , are randomized , and receive the study 
intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study  will not be replaced.

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
The study will utilize the following procedures, measures, and assessments during eligibility screening and data collection.  
 Following recruitment, research staff will be responsible for completing an assessment of eligibility for 
each potential participant. In doing so, they will  assess language spoken, age, county of residence, plans 
for relocation, and plans for serving criminal sentence(s). If the client reports that they have plans to 
move outside of Cook County or to serve a prison or jail sentence within the next [ADDRESS_726105] 
days as their county of resid ence.   
 Next, the research assistant will administer the DSM -5 for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] [7]. The client must 
answer “yes” to at least [ADDRESS_726106] 12 months . The research assistant  will also administer the  Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9721] (COWS ) 
[8], for which we have develop ed protocols with input from an addiction medicine specialist to ensure it 
can be  administered easily by [CONTACT_105] -clinician research assistants . Clients who score  36 or more on the 
scale will be excluded , as this is an indication of severe withdrawal. [ Note: These clients will be provided 
an imme diate referral to care with a physician despi[INVESTIGATOR_552434].]  
 
The research assistant  will then discuss the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_552435], which 
is a shared decision -making tool created by [CONTACT_552463] a visual explanation of all 3  
MOUDs  (i.e., buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone). During this discussion, the research assistant 
and client will walk through the treatment options and confirm the client’s MOUD treatment interest. As 
long as the client expresses interest in at least 1 of the 3 medication types then they meet eligibility requirements. It is also at this point  that the research assistant will clarify which type of MOUD the client 
is initially interested in (though they will be all owed to change their minds). The research assistant will 
clarify whether the client is initially interested in suboxone or vivitrol, or initially open to considering 
Project STAMINA  
Protocol 138- 0420   Version 11  
  02/17/2022  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 17 these MOUDs, OR only initially interested in  methadone. [This clarification will be used in the blocking 
randomization described previously under “ 6.3 Measures to minimize bias: Randomization and 
blinding”.]  
 
Finally, the research assistant (i) ask s the client to take a  urine drug screen.  If they are negative for 
buprenorphine  or methadone, the research assistant will move forward. If they are positive for either  
medication, the research assistant will ask the client if they are currently taking “x” medication as a part 
of a prescribed treatment plan. If they are taking medication they purchased through the illicit drug 
market , then the research assistant will move forward. If they are already taking medication that is 
prescribed, they will be excluded.  
 Research assistants  will continue to read the full recruitment script with eligible clients and complete 
the informed consent process for anyone meeting all criteria and interested in participating. The 
research assistant will begin data collection with all consented participants. This includes a 45 –60-
minute structured interview that is collected in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data 
collection system . This interview  cover s the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]:  
1. Full name, Date of Birth, SSN (used for locating purposes), and UI Health Medical Record 
Number (MRN)  
2. Demographic information  
3. Social support  
4. Child welfare involvement  
5. Housing and homelessness  
6. Alcohol use  
7. Drug use  
8. Heroin cravings  
9. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801]  
10. Overdose experiences  
11. Physical and mental health  
12. Trauma exposure  
13. Criminal justice involvement  
14. Treatment motivation  
15. Quality of life  
 
The interview  will also request participant contact [CONTACT_3031] ( i.e., Client Contact & Locator Form). This 
information will not be used as research data, but rather, will aid the scheduling of research follow -up 
visits. The form will ask participants for (1) their contact [CONTACT_3031], (2) the contact [CONTACT_552464], (3) the contact [CONTACT_552465]. Additionally , all participants 
will have submitted a urine drug screen during recruitment,  and this will also be used as a form of data. 
The results of the screen will be entered into REDCap with the participant’s  interview data. All 
participants will be asked to complete the REDCap interview and a second urine drug screen at 3 -
months. Participants will be asked to return to the recruitment site to complete these activities; however, participants can be accommodate d to complete the interview by [CONTACT_552466].   
Lastly, as part of data collection, we will access the participant ’s protected health information (PHI) from 
the four sources listed below.

• (1) Mile Square Health Center and (2) Family Guidance Center Records : We will request MOUD 
treatment data from Mile Square Health Center and Family Guidance Center. These data will be 
used to understand participant MOUD linkage, engagement, and retention.  These data will 
include dates of service, medications prescribed, and treatment details to understand 
complianc e. The same data will be pulled for participants in both arms. Note : We recognize that 
not all patients will go to Mile Square Health Center or Family Guidance Center after their appointment or referral, but we plan to access these medical records for any consented 
participant. Participants will not be withdrawn from the study should they not be treated at MSHC or Family Guidance, as this is an intent to treat study. Thus, we will have to rely on self-
report data for participants who choose to be treated elsewhere.  
 
• (3) Illinois Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP)  Records : We will request dispensation data 
for buprenorphine from the Illinois Prescription Monitoring Program. Though  we ask 
participant s to self -report whether they have engaged in medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_552436], the PMP data will allow us to verify whether they have been dispensed any of the prescriptions. This helps us to understand the nature of whether a participant is in volved in 
treatment.  
 
• (4) Illinois Vital Records : We will collect  Vitals Record data for the purpose of verifying whether a 
participant passed away. We understand that individuals who use drugs are at the risk of overdose, or other drug- related health issues which can lead to death, and while our goal is to 
enroll these  clients in treatment, the possibility of relapse or health issues remain present. Thus, 
we are obtaining this data to verify if a participant disengaged from the study because of death and to understand whether that death was caused by [CONTACT_350384].  
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 Not applicable.  
 
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 This protocol uses the definition of a dverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a) : any untoward medical 
occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered 
intervention related.  
 
This will include the following: mental health -related outpatient treatment; criminal arrests, bookings, 
or charges; criminal detainment or imprisonment; new  chronic health condition . 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if it results in any of the  
Project STAMINA  
Protocol 138- 0420   Version 11  
  02/17/2022  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 19 following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_552437], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  
conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not  
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based  
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or  
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
This will include the following: death; attempted suicide; overdose -related ER visit; overdose -related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; mental health -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , 
assessed  by [CONTACT_552467]/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study procedures  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
procedures  and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study procedures  and the AE . 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures  caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study procedures  and event onset , or an 
alternate etiology has been established.  
 OR 
 
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study procedures  administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
study procedures  should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically o r 
phenomenologically definitive . 
Project STAMINA  
Protocol 138- 0420   Version 11  
  02/17/2022  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 20 • Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonable time after  administration of the study procedures , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal.  
• Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study procedures ). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE  may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study procedures  administration makes a causal relationship improbable 
(e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
procedures ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible 
explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study  procedures  administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 Unanticipated AEs are events that are not consistent with the foreseeable risk associated with research  
procedures or are not expected in the natural progression of any underlying condition of the sample.  
The AEs and SAEs identified in Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 are anticipated as they are commonly  associated 
with the course of OUD. Per Chestnut Health IRB policies, all deaths are  considered unanticipated 
events.  
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel when (a) attempting to contact [CONTACT_552468] 3 -month follow -up or 
(b) during the 3 -month study follow -up. 
 
(a) If study staff are notified of a participant death while attempting to make contact [CONTACT_552469] -up data collection, they will complete an “Adverse Event Form” for submission to the IRB. 
Per the Chestnut Health IRB policies, all studies are to report u nanticipated events to the IRB’s 
Human Protections Administrator within 2 business days of PI [INVESTIGATOR_520383].  
(b) Study staff will learn of other AEs or SAEs during the 3 -month study follow -up. For anticipated 
events, information will be reported at study -end reporting on Clinical Trials.gov. For 
unanticipated events , information will be reported  to the IRB’s Human Protections 
Administrator within [ADDRESS_726107] STAMINA

o Null: No difference in illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_552438].  
o Alternative: A difference  in illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_552439].  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
A power analysis determined a minimum sample size of n = [ADDRESS_726109] an odds ratio of 2.0 for a binary predictor (the intervention effect) in a logistic regression with 80% power. The control group’s proportion of successful treatment initiatio n was set at 0.35. Assuming an 80% study retention 
rate across all three waves of data collection, the recruitment goal has been set at n = 350 total participants (n = 175 for each arm).  
 
Due to circumstances encountered during the study period (i.e., disruptions due to COVID -19 
pandemic), study recruitment did not reach the target sample size. The final sample included 274 
baseline participants and 221 follow -up interviews (80% retention).  With a sample size of N=221, the 
minimum detectable odds ratio at alpha=.05 and 80% power is 2.16.

 23 9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
 
Primary outcome analyses of treatment engagement will be conducted on the sample of all randomized 
participants, i.e., intention -to-treat (ITT) sample. Analyses of treatment retention will include all 
participants who initiated treatment within [ADDRESS_726110] deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. All inferential tests will be 2 -tailed; we will report 95% confidence intervals and 
exact p -values. Pre -specified covariates are listed in the sections below.  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Primary Outcome: Linkage to medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD)  
 We will use multivariable, binary logistic regression models with linkage to MOUD  (yes/no) as the 
dependent variable. Linkage  will be defined as visiting  the treatment provider within [ADDRESS_726111] -
enrollment, based on electronic medical records (EMR) . In the event that EMR data is not available for 
some participants (i.e., participants who received care at a clinic without a study affiliation), we will 
substitute self -report data for those records and conduct a sensitivity analysis. Participants lost to  
follow -up will be coded as not linked to treatment.  
 
The primary independent variable in these models will be a dichotomous indicator for treatment condition (0 = CC; 1 = TC). Control variables will include at a minimum: demographics (age, sex, 
race/ethnicity), baseline severity of substance use disorder, baseline severity of psychological distress, 
and past overdose experiences. We will also control for treatment preference (methadone only vs. any MOUD), and location  (a dichotomous variable represent ing each of the COIP sites. )  If covariate 
missingness is g reater than 10% we will use multiple imputation; otherwise, we will use complete case 
analysis. Results will be presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and predicted probabilities. Alternatively, the outcome can be modeled using robust Pois son regression to obtain risk 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures:  
• Medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD) treatment engagement  
• Medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD) treatment retention  
• Self- report non- medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]  
• Detected non- prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_552440] 138- 0420   Version 11

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 24 The analytic sample for secondary outcomes will include participants linked to treatment after the 
baseline visit. W e will use multivariable, binary logistic regression models with engagement (yes/no) and 
retention (yes/no) as dependent variable s. Engagement will be defined as making at least [ADDRESS_726112] -
enrollment.  
 
The primary independent variable in these models will be a dichotomous indicator for treatment 
condition (0 = CC; 1 = TC). Control variables will include at a minimum: demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), baseline severity of substance use disorder, baseline severity of psychological distress, and past overdose experiences. We will also control for treatment preference (methadone only vs. any MOUD), and location (a dichotomous variable represent ing each of the COIP sites. ) If covariate 
missingness is gr eater than 10% we will use multiple imputation; otherwise,  we will use complete case 
analysis. Results will be presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and predicted probabilities. Alternatively, the outcome can be modeled using robust Poisson regression to obtain risk ratios with 95% confidence in tervals.  
 Illicit drug use at follow -up will be measured as a dichotomous variable (presence/absence in urine) , and 
modeled in a similar fashion using multivariable, binary logistic regression models.   Treatment engagement at follow -up can also be modeled  as a count variable (number of sessions 
attended per unit time) using Poisson or negative binomial regression; or treated as continuous if normality assumptions are met and modeled using ordinary least squares regression.  
 An alternate measure of engagement is to assess how long each participant remained in treatment 
defined as being either the last treatment appointment kept, or participant’s self- report of the date they 
discontinued using buprenorphine. The time to discont inuation of treatment/medication can then be 
modeled using survival analysis or proportional hazard models. These models provide information on how long persons remain in treatment allowing comparisons of the survival times (or conversely, 
periods of highe st risk for droppi[INVESTIGATOR_26050]) by [CONTACT_552470].  If the proportional hazards 
assumption is met, we will use Cox regression; otherwise, we will use an accelerated failure time model 
such as Weibull regression.

urine test), overdose, substance use treatment history, chronic health cond itions, criminal- legal system 
involvement (arrest, jail/prison, probation/parole), and psychosocial measures (trauma symptoms, depression, serious mental illness). We will compute chi- square tests and report exact p -values.

 Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be given to  
the participant , and written documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to starting the  
study intervention. The following consent materials are used during this process: (1) consent form, (2) 
list of competency questions, (3) health information release form, (4) locator release form.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Once the initial eligibility has been determined during the screening process, the  research assistant will 
provide the client with a copy of the consent form and keep one for themselves. Consent documents will 
be provided in English only, as English -speaking abilities are required for eligibility. Together, they will 
discuss the consent form in detail. Once the consent document has been fully reviewed, the research

 26 assistant will check for the final eligibility criteria by [CONTACT_552472]. The questions include:  
 
a) Can you repeat to me the purpose of the study? ( Participant must indicate they know we are 
interested in treatment linkage or studying linkage to medication. ) 
b) Do you remember how long this process (i.e., enrollment and intervention) could take today? 
(Participant must indicate 2 -3 hours .) 
c) Do you remember what you should do if you decided you no longer wish to take part in the 
study after leaving here? ( Participants must indicate that they know  to contact [CONTACT_552473] .) 
 
If the client is able to answer these questions, the y will be deemed eligible. The research assistant will 
ask the client to print, sign, and date the form; the research assistant will do the same.  
  
In addition to the consent form, the research assistant will also review two additional forms: a (1) health 
information release for the methadone provider, which permits the study team to access  methadone 
treatment data from the external methadone provider  (i.e., Family Guidance) for the participant’s study 
6-month window, and (2)  locator release form for participant tracking purposes, which permits the 
study team to speak with the contacts provided by [CONTACT_552474] ’s whereabouts 
and latest contact [CONTACT_3031]. The research assistant will go through the forms’ contents in full detail 
and allow the participant to ask questions. The participant will be asked to sign each form  at the 
conclusion of the review .  
 
10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
 This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable  
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be  
provided by [CONTACT_87077], funding agency, and/or regulatory  
authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principal investigators will promptly inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and sponsor/funding agency and will provide the  
reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:

10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
 This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or  
International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) requirements. The  
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a  
result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
 
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
• Section 5.20 Noncompliance, subsections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 
It will be the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_552441]. All major deviations will be reported to the IRB promptly, within 5 business days.  
Minor protocol deviations will be reported at the time of the subsequent IRB renewal or closure.

 32 10.4 PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  HISTORY  
 
Version  Date  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
2 7/20/2020  The “Follow -Up Contact [CONTACT_552480]” was removed from the 
protocols and replaced with a “ Client 
Contact [CONTACT_552481]” information 
form was added to the enrollment 
procedures. Chestnut Health 
research staff will also review this 
form via telephone with each participant during the baseline visit.  
 
Questions concerning comfort levels 
of different appointment modalities 
were added to baseline data 
collection.  
 UI Health Medical Record Number (MRN) has been added as a recorded variable to baseline data collection.  
 
Protocols were amended to permit 
research staff, rather than only COIP 
staff, to schedule MOUD appointments for the control arm participants.  Chestnut Health research staff 
will now be responsible for 
scheduling all follow -up 
interviews and additional 
contact [CONTACT_552482].  
   
Due to COVID -19, telemedicine 
appointments are more 
common and accepted. Thus, we want to measure participants’ comfort associated with different modalities.   The MRN will permit research 
staff to obtain administrative 
MOUD treatment data.  
 
Research staff will schedule 
appointments to improve the client flow and decrease 
confusion.

  02/17/[ADDRESS_726126] and 
clarified that the $35 follow -up 
payment includes $25 for the 
interview and $10 for the drug 
screen.  
 
Additional COVID -19-related 
disclaimers were added to the consent form that permit changes to 
the follow -up data collection.  The payment form and 
breakdown clarification were amended to permit  telephone 
data collection, without drug 
screen, due to COVID -19.  
4 08/25/2020  The eligibility screener for opi[INVESTIGATOR_552443] 
(SOWS) to the Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_113003] (COWS), with the 
“extreme” range still being excluded 
and offered immediate treatment.  The screener amendment was a 
result of advice from the clinical 
team at MOUD treatment 
provider. The providers 
indicated the COWS provides 
better accuracy.  
5 09/09/2020  Block randomization was added to 
our protocols (i.e., one block for people interested solely in methadone treatment, one block for people open to any medication).  
 Family Guidance was added to the list of administrative data sources.  The block randomization will 
permit us to examine the two sets of participants individually, if needed, given that the treatment linkage for 
methadone and 
suboxone/vivitrol is different.  
 
Family Guidance was added to the list of administrative data sources because Mile Square has not yet been able to offer 
methadone due to COVID -19 
related delays in  the approval 
process.    
6 10/14/2020  A “Consent to Contact” form was 
added to our recruitment protocols.  The form permits us to gather 
someone’s contact [CONTACT_552483] a time that works for their schedule or 
when they are ready for 
treatment.  
7 1/11/2021  The consent form was amended to 
more clearly describe the duration of 
baseline activities.  
 
The “Consent Competency Checklist” 
was also amended to include a The consent form and 
“Competency Checklist” amendments aim to ensure participants understand the length of the baseline activities 
and encourages enrollments

time to complete all activities.  
 
The audio recording of the MOUD discussion will be used for quality assurance to ensure research staff explain the 
medications accurately. The 
addition of the research data 
permission will provide insight 
on client opi[INVESTIGATOR_552444].  
8 4/22/[ADDRESS_726128] permission to obtain a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_552445].   The drug screen type was 
amended because the urine screen provides better 
accuracy.  
 
Due to slow enrollment, the removal of the 6 -month 
interview will allow for an 
extended recruitment period . 
The addition of the recruitment company assistance is also to 
improve enrollment rates.  
 
The photo of participants will 
be used to improve tracking 
abilities and increase rates of 
follow -up interviews.  
  
 
9 5/17/2021  The saliva drug screen at baseline 
has been eliminated (leaving only the urine drug screen at both time points).  
 The consent form was amended to better explain possible costs associated with treatment.  The removal of the saliva drug 
screen occurred because the tests proved to be unreliable and challenging to use.  
 
The consent form was amended to ensure that participants understand that there are possible costs associated with treatment should they decide to receive treatment outside of Mile Square, which is an FQHC 
and has the ability to assist 
patients in applying for

 35 insurance and covering 
treatment costs.   
10 6/24/2021  The baseline incentive amount was 
increased from $25 to $50.  
 
The recruitment protocols were 
amended to include assistance from 
a Lighthouse Institute outreach.  
 
Questions from the baseline and follow -up questionnaires were 
removed to shorten the interview length.  The baseline interview is more 
intensive and time -consuming 
than the follow -up interview, 
and feedback from participants 
indicated that the discrepancy 
in payment between baseline ($25) and follow -up ($35) was 
unfair.  
[Note: All previously consented participants will be offered the compensation difference.]  
 The addition of the outreach 
team is to improve enrollment 
rates.  
 Unnecessary questions were removed from the instruments to decrease the time burden on participants.

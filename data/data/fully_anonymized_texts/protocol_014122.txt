N-acetylcysteine (NAC ) has been an e stablished drug since the 1960s. It  is on the World 
Health Organization’s List  of 40 Essential Medicines )a and is FDA appro ved. NAC is a 
precursor to the amino acid L -cysteine and the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) ,2 shown to 
promote homeostatic glutamate regulation by [CONTACT_278879] . The sulfhydryl group ( –SH) 
within the NAC molecule directly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) ,3 modulates 
the redox s tate of the N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino -3-hydroxy -5-methyl -4-
isoxazolepropi[INVESTIGATOR_149046] (AMPA) receptors (neurotransmitter eff ect),4 and inhibits the 
nuclear factor kappa -light-chain -enhancer of activated B cells (NF -κB) to modulate  
cytokine synthesis (anti/pro -inflammatory effect ).[ADDRESS_340494] known as the treatment  for hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen 
toxicity.6b However , NAC has also been utilized to treat psychiatric di sorders (e.g, 
schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorders, addiction , compulsivity , anxiety ), 
neurodegenerative disease  symptom s (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease),

brain injury , and numerous other conditions .7-16 There are also case reports of NAC 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_278850].17  In the perioperative period, NAC has been primarily studied for its anti -
inflammatory properties18 and was noted to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956].19 Although NAC has been used in outpatient studies 
for patients with chronic pain associated with sickle  cell anemia20 and diabetic 
neuropathy,14,21 we are not aware of any studies examining NAC to enhance perioperative 
analgesia and decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499] . 
3.0 Intervention  to be studied  
This study will involve administration of IV NAC or placebo (0.45% NaCl  or 0.9% NaCl ) 
in the perioperative period to patients scheduled for elective spi[INVESTIGATOR_278851]. Our hypothesis is that NAC will reduce 
postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. This study will al so examine the optimal dose of NAC 
to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  
NAC has a long history of safe administration and is frequently administered to critically 
ill patients .6,17,19 
Medication information:  NAC is FDA approved for multiple indications  including an 
antidote to poisoning caused by a cetaminophen overdose  and prevention of acute hepatic 
injury .b It has been utilized to treat critically ill patients for over 60 years . It is generally 
well tolerated  and has an excellent safety profile.  Due to this excellent safety profile and 
with the approved dosing, this study will utilize NAC doses equa l to the loading dose for 
acetaminophen treatment (150 mg/kg) or less (50 or 100 mg/kg).  
Mechanism : NAC exerts its therapeutic effect through several mechanisms . NAC replete s 
glutathione reserves by [CONTACT_278880], which is an essential precursor in glutathione 
production. NAC by [CONTACT_278881]. It 
also increases oxygen delivery to tissues, by [CONTACT_278882] , and 
altering the microvascular tone to increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to the liver and 
other vital organs.   
 
4.0 Study Endpoints   
• The primary outcome will be 12 -hour postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].   
• The secondary outcome will be 6-hour postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_278852].  
• Other exploratory outcomes will include intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], 
postoperative anesthesia care unit (PA CU) opi[INVESTIGATOR_278844], non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_278853], postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_278854], 
and VAS pain scores at additional time points.   
• Other collected data will include patient demographic data, surgical data ( procedure, 
operative duration), preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].

6.0 Number of Subjects  
Sample size: [ADDRESS_340495] 20 subjects: We will initially randomize 5 patients to each dose group (placebo , 50, 
100, and 150 mg/kg) to estimate the dose response curve and to identify the optimal dose.  
After enrollment of the first 20 patients, the study will undergo review  by [CONTACT_278883] .  
• If the dose response curve is adequate and the op timal dose identified, 15 additional 
patients will be randomized to placebo and 15 to the optimal dose to estimate the 
difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_278856]. the optimal dose.  
(Total of 50 subjects with 20 from dose response curv e and 30 to estimate the 
difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].)  
• If the dose response cur ve is not adequate after the initial 20  subjects  5 per each 
dose group, we will randomize and enroll an additional 5 patients to each dose 
group (placebo, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg) to estimate the dose response curve and to 
identify the optimal dose.  Once the optimal dose is identified with these initial 40 
patients, 10 additional patients will be randomized to placebo and 1 0 to the optimal 
dose to estimate the difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_278857]. the optimal dose . ([ADDRESS_340496] imate the difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].)  
• A sample size of 20 subjects per group (placebo and optimal dose) allows us to 
estimate a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_278858] a width of + 0.[ADDRESS_340497] deviations from the  mean. We will plan to consent 
70 subjects to account for withdrawal but  will complete the study once 50  or 60  
subjects (based on the number of subjects required to create the dose response 
curve) have completed the protocol.

8.0 Recruitment Methods  
• Potential subjects on the surgical schedule undergoing elective surgery of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_278859]  4 levels  or less  will be screened for eligibility.  
• Information regarding the study will be presented to subject by a study team member 
in the surgical clinic or preoperative anesthesia clinic  or in the preoperative period 
prior  to sedation .  On the day of surgery, subjects may then choose to provide writte n 
consent, decline to participate, or rescind their prior consent.   
9.0 Consent Process  
• Regardless of the preoperative location, the study team will present to the subject 
with risks and benefits of the study and the study medication (NAC). Subjects may 
provide written consent at that time or choose to consider the study until the day of 
surgery. Potential participants will be given time to read the consent and ask 
questions. Consent will be obtained from subjects  by [CONTACT_278884]. Written consent will be 
completed once all questions are answered and exclusion and inclusion verified.

10.0 Study Design  / Methods  
Design :  This prospective, double  blinded clinical trial will randomize patient to receive 
placebo (0.45% NaCl  or 0.9% NaCl ) or NAC (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg) . The randomization 
will be created by a statistician and shared with Investigational Drug Services  (IDS) 
pharmacy prior to patient enrollment.  
IDS pharmacy has planned to set up the study to be dispensed from the main OR 
pharmacy. IDS will prepare numbered kits containing NAC or placebo based on the 
randomization scheme. The kits will be stored in the OR pharmac y and dispensed based on 
the assigned subject number. This will allow enrollment any time of day that the OR 
pharmacy is open.  
Groups: Patients will be randomized to receive NAC: 0 mg/kg (placebo ; 0.45% N aCl or 
0.9% NaCl ), 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 150 mg/ kg (Max dose 15,000  mg).  The maximum 
dose considered will be 150 mg/kg as this has been studied for safety in numerous  patient 
populations  including those with severe comorbidities . As NAC may be reconstituted in 
D5W or 0.45% NaCl , we will reconstitute al l NAC doses in 250ml 0.45% NaCl  or D5W. 
We will use 250ml 0.45% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl without NAC as our placebo.  
Enrollment:  
Following confirmation of informed written consent, patients will be  assigned an 
enrollment number  and randomized  using the randomization, created by a statistician,  to 
one of four IV NAC groups: 0 mg/kg ( placebo ; 0.45% NaCl  or 0.9% NaCl ), 50 mg/kg, 100 
mg/kg, or 150 mg/kg. Patients will proceed to the operating room where they will receive 
general anesthesia for the ir planned, elective surgical procedure. Intraoperatively, the 
designated IV NAC or placebo infusion will be initiated and completed  by a clinical care 
team member.  Patients will only receive NAC once as a single dose  that will run over 60 
Version 3; Version Date: 02/01/[ADDRESS_340498] perioperative care at MUSC .  
The recorded anesthesia stop will mark time zero. The primary end point will be 12 -hour 
postoperative o pi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  
Patient and procedural characteristic will be recorded throughout the perioperative period.  
Demographic data (age, gender, race, weight, height, body mass index) and preoperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_278861] (yes or no; and 
consumption quantified if applicable). Surgical data (operative procedure and surgical 
duration) will be collected after surgery. Time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278862]. 
Other exploratory outcomes will be collected as long as the patient is still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278863] -report  up to [ADDRESS_340499]. These data include 
intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) opi[INVESTIGATOR_278864], non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_278845], postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_278865] [ADDRESS_340500] 
operatively .  
In order to identify the optimal IV NAC dose for perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_278866], the study will progress in two phases . 
• In the first phase  (20 subjects) , we will attempt to identify the optimal dose . The 
optimal dose  is defined as the dose or doses of NAC for which a >20% redu ction in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_278867].  If 20% reduction is not achieved , the optimal dose will be the maximum 
dose (150 mg/kg) administered during the study.   
• In the second phase, a fter finding the o ptimal dose, 15 additional patients will be 
randomized to placebo and 15 to the optimal dose to estimate the difference in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_278868]. the optimal dose  (30 subjects) .  
A sample size of 20 subjects per group (5 from ph ase 1 an d 15 from phase 2) 
allows us to estimate a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_278869] a width of + 0.[ADDRESS_340501] deviations from the mean . 
• If we are unable to create a dose response curve following the enrollment of the 
first [ADDRESS_340502], an additional 20 subjects (5 per group) will be enrolled to create the 
dose response curve prior to starting the second phase.  
Research procedures: The IV N AC dose [0 mg/kg (placebo ; 0.45% NaCl  or 0.9% NaCl ), 
50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 150 mg/kg] will be the only research procedure.  
All other aspects of preoperative (e.g., clinic visits, labs, imaging) intraoperative (e.g, 
surgical procedures, anesthesia medica tions or procedures), and postoperative care (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278870], clinic follow -up, labs, imaging) will not be research 
procedures but consistent with planned patient care for a patient having elective spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017] . The patient will be resp onsible for all charges related to the surgery and 
perioperative care excluding the NAC medication.  
 
Version 3; Version Date: 02/01/[ADDRESS_340503].  An electronic enrollment log 
will link patient name [CONTACT_9381]/her study ID number. This log will be kept 
separate from all research data.  All paper i nformation will be kept  in a locked cabinet in a 
locked office.  All electronic data will be kept on MUSC's password protected server.  
Electronic data will be kept on a password protected MUSC server and a redcap database.  
All paper documents will be kept in a locked cabinet, in a locked office.  Only IRB 
approved, CITI trained study team members will have access to the data.  All data will be 
kept for 6 years per MUSC policy.  
 
 13.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  (if applicable)  
Any adverse events related to NAC will be treated according to MUSC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278871].  
The Department of Anesthesia’s DSMB will review the study on an annual basis. Any 
adverse events will be reported and reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. Adverse events will be 
reported to MUSC’s IRB per policy.  
All data will be kept in a locked office, in a locked cabinet, and electronic data will be 
stored on a password protected MUSC server  or red cap database . Only CITI certified, IRB 
approved study team members will have access to data.   
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  (if applicable)  
• Circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the research without 
their consent include severe allergy/in tolerance to NAC.  
• Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time . If patients voluntarily withdraw 
from the research study, they will receive our institutional standard of care for 
perioperative pain management.  
 15.0 Risks to Subjects  
• IV NAC can cause rate  related anaphylactoid reactions in 0.2-18% of patients.22,[ADDRESS_340504] of the anaphylactoid reactions are mild (6%) or moderate (10%) with severe 
reactions (i.e., bronchospasm and hypotension ) rare at 1%  or less . Bronchospasm more 
commonly occurs in  patients with pre -existing reactive airway diseases , like asthma. 
Bronchodilating agents are effective in treating these patients.  To minimize this risk, 
patients with asthma, wheezing, or prescribed bronchodilators will be excluded from 
the study . Similarly, patients with a history of a prior anaphylactoi d reactions to 
acetylcysteine  will also be excluded.  
If an anaphylactoid events occurs, patients will be treated as described by [CONTACT_278885] .b IV NAC will be stopped immediately  and the patient treated with 
antihistamine medication (e.g., diphenhydrami ne) and IV fluid s if required . 
Vasopressors are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_278872]. NAC therapy may be restart ed at a slower 
rate after resolution of any possible reaction. However, if an anaphylactoid reaction or 
 
 
Version 3; Version Date: 02/01/2021  
 Page 7 of 10  similar symptoms return upon reinitiating NAC treatment or increases in severity, IV 
NAC will be discontinued. Additionally, all possible medication reactions will be 
reported to the Anesthesia DSMB and MUS C IRB.  
There is also a risk of loss of confidenti ality.   
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
• IV NAC may provide analgesia with reduce d postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. 
This may help reduce postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_278873]. Because opi[INVESTIGATOR_278874], including nausea, 
vomiting, pruritus, c onstipation, sedation , and respi[INVESTIGATOR_278875] , reduction in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_278876], in turn, reduce the frequency/severity of these side effects.  
• Patients receiving the placebo may receive no dir ect benefit from participating but  
will receive current standard care for their surgical procedure.

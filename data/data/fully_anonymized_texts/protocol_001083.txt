Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Drug Under Study:  ADX-102 
 
Title of Protocol:  A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Masked, Vehicle- Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution in Subjects with Non-infectious  Anterior Uveitis 
Protocol Number: 
ADX-102-UV-005  Phase: 3 Indication: Anterior Uveitis  
Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution on  anterior chamber cell count 
(ACC), in subjects with non-in fectious anterior uveitis. 
 Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution on the signs and 
symptoms of anterior uveitis in subjects with non-infectious anterior uveitis.
 
Study Endpoints 
 Signs and symptoms of anterior uveitis which include anterior chamber cell count, anterior chamber 
flare, limbal injection, hypopyon, peripheral anterior synechiae, keratic precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263], posterior synechiae, 
ocular pain, lacrimation, photophobia, blurry vision and visual acuity  
 Incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in clinical laboratory values and changes in intraocular 
pressure (IOP) values  
 Self-reported visual function with the National Ey e Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25)  
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in which approximately 120 subjects with endogenous non-infectious anterior uv eitis will be randomized (1:1) to receive either: 
Group 1 ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution (0.5%)  
Group 2 Vehicle of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution 
Randomization will be stratified based on baseline ACC score. The dosing schedule is summarized in Table 1 . 
Subjects will be followed for up to five (5) weeks and m onitored for safety and effi cacy at seven (7) scheduled 
visits.  Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_612097]. 
Each subject’s study participation will consist of th e following visits: Screening/Randomization (Day 1; Visit 1 ), 
Day 4 +/- 1 day ( Visit 2 ), Week 1 (Day 8 +/- 1 day; Visit 3 ), Week 2 (Day 15 +/- 2 days; Visit 4 ), Week 3 (Day 
22 +/- 2 days; Visit 5 ), Week 4 (Day 29 +/- 3 days; Visit 6/EOT/ET) and Week 5 telephone follow-up (Day 36 
+/- 3 days; Visit 7/End of Study [EOS] ). The total time in the study is approximately 5 weeks. 
At the Screening/Randomization Visit, subjects will pr ovide written informed consent and then study eligibility 
will be assessed. Eligible subjects will be randomized, disp ensed study drug and instructed on dosing as well as 
on completing the subject dosing diary.  Subjects will be  randomly assigned treatment as described above.  
Treatment Period: Subjects will be instructed to administer study drug and to return to the clinic for Weeks 1 
through 4.  
Rescue therapy will be available to all subjects that do not demonstrate a clinical response based on predefined 
rescue criteria.  Rescued subjects will complete the Week 4 /  End of Treatment/Earl y Termination (EOT/ET)  
visit.

Topi[INVESTIGATOR_612089]: 
All subjects entered into this trial must meet the following criteria:  
1. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements, has gone through the consent 
process and has signed an approv ed informed consent form.    
2. Male or female subjects aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 85 years. 
3. Subjects with acute endogenous non-infectious anteri or uveitis with onset of symptoms within the 
previous 2 weeks.*  Subjects experiencing a bilatera l epi[INVESTIGATOR_612090]. Evaluations for selective infectious etiologies, including but not limited to Syphilis, 
Tuberculosis (if indicated), Herpes Simplex, Herp es Zoster, CMV, Lyme Disease or other suspected 
infectious etiology, must be performed during the screening period or within 3 months of randomization. 
4. Presence of 6-50 anterior chamber cells within one field of view as measured with a slit lamp 
microscope (Grade 1+ to Grade 3+, Appendix 1) in the study eye(s). 
5. Subjects must have pachymetry corrected IOP <[ADDRESS_811496] corrected visual acuity (BCVA) better than or equal to 35 letters in the study eye and 65 letters in 
the non-study eye using ETDRS testing.  Note: this crite ria is also applicable for a subject with bilateral 
uveitis. 
7. Females of childbearing potential must be using or  willing to use a medically acceptable method (as 
defined by [CONTACT_737]) of birth control.  Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are either surgically sterile or postmenopausal.  Postmenopausal women are defined as women with cessation of menstruation for 12 consecutive months prior to signing of the informed consent form.

Proprietary and Confidential  *A history of prior flare-ups or subs equent flare-ups in the non-study eye sh ould not affect eligibility, provided 
that the subject is deemed capable of  administering separate treatments to  each eye. For example, if an enrolled 
subject experiences a flare-up in the non-study eye, the s ubject should remain in the study, and the non-study eye 
should receive the standard of care treatment. Likewise,  if a potential subject was already receiving standard of 
care treatment in the non-st udy eye prior to enrollment, the second eye is eligible for the st udy and the non-study 
eye will continue to receive the standard of care. 
 
Criteria for Exclusion:  
Subjects will be excluded from this trial if  they meet any of the following criteria: 
1. Have severe/serious ocular pathology in the study eye(s) which may preclude study completion, in 
the judgement of the Investigator. 
2. Any medical condition or clinical laboratory test which in the judgment of the Investigator makes the subject unsuitable for the study. 
3. Currently or within past  [ADDRESS_811497] a history of malignancy other than successfully treated 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or  successfully treated in situ cervical cancer. 
4. Active intermediate or posterior uveitis in the study eye(s). Note: a subject with isolated macular edema without evidence of active intermediate or posterior uveitis is eligible for enrolment.  
5. Known or observed mild to seve re (1-4+) fibrinoid reaction. 
6. Previous anterior uveitis epi[INVESTIGATOR_612091] ≤ [ADDRESS_811498] and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation su rgery or corneal transplantation surgery in the 
study eye(s) within the past 3 months prior to Visit 1, or subjects who may require penetrating intraocular surgery in the study eye(s) during the study. 
 Subjects who are [ADDRESS_811499]-surgery in the study 
eye(s) are eligible. 
 Any other penetrating intraocular surgery in the study eye(s) within [ADDRESS_811500]-surgery in the 
study eye(s). 
8. Oral corticosteroid within the past [ADDRESS_811501] 14 days prior to Visit 1 
(Maximum of 3 doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_612092] 7 days prior to Visit 1  is 
permitted). 
10. Intravitreal corticosteroid treatment in the study eye within the past [ADDRESS_811502] 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 and no change in dosing is anticipated for the 
duration of the study. 
15. Systemic immunomodulatory agents (e.g. azathioprine, methot rexate, mycophenolate mofetil), 
unless the dose has been stable for the last [ADDRESS_811503] results which do not meet the above inclusion/exclusion criteria may have the underlying test repeated once if it is thought to represent a laboratory error; a reversible, clinically insignificant intermittent 
condition; or is not consistent with the subject’s historical  values.  If inclusion/exclus ion criteria are not met after 
the repeat test, the subject should be considered a screen failure and should not be enrolled in the study.

 Safety 
Adverse events will be summarized, and event rates will be presented by [CONTACT_2939]. Any other information 
collected (such as severity or relationship to study drug ) will be listed as appropriate.  Any statistical tests 
performed to explore the data will be used only to high light any interesting comparisons that may warrant further 
consideration.  
DSMB 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established. They will review all available safety 
data after approximately [ADDRESS_811505] completed th e study visit 7. The assessment of safety will be 
determined from ophthalmologic endpoints including slit la mp examinations, ocular scores, visual acuity and 
IOP, vital sign measurements, physi cal examinations, hematology and chemistry laboratory testing, use of 
concomitant medications, and review of adverse events (AEs).  Based on the safety data provided, the DSMB will 
determine if it is acceptable to continue the study or modify the study design as appropriate. Additional DSMB 
reviews will occur throughout the tria l approximately every [ADDRESS_811506] of the DSMB.

3) Treponemal antibody test(s) within the previous 6 months unless intervening new onset symptoms of any STD, or STD exposure are documented 
Additional testing such as for RPR, ACE, ANCA, quantiferon and ANA may be performed at the discretion of the investigator.  
e  Safety laboratory tests are hematology including: “hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC 
morphology, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and absolute platelet 
count” and chemistry including: “albumin, alkaline ph osphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT; SGPT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST; SGOT), bilirubin (total and direct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, 
carbon dioxide (CO2), chloride, creatinine, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), glucose, phosphate, potassium, 
sodium, total protein, and uric acid.”

*A history of prior flare-ups or subsequent fl are-ups in the non-study eye should not affect 
eligibility, provided that the subject is deemed capable of admi nistering separate treatments to 
each eye. For example, if an enrolled subject exp eriences a flare-up in the non-study eye, the 
subject should remain in the study, and the non-study eye should receive the standard of care 
treatment. Likewise, if a potenti al subject was already receivi ng standard of care treatment in 
the non-study eye prior to enrollment, the second eye is eligible for the study and the non-study 
eye will continue to receive the standard of care. 
6.2 Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects will be excluded from this trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 
 
1. Have severe/serious ocular pathology in  the study eye(s) which may preclude study 
completion, in the judgement of the Investigator.

red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC morphology, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cor puscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and absolute platelet count. 
 
At Screening (Visit 1) and Week 4 (Visit 6-EOT/ET)  - Serum Chemistry Profile: albumin, 
alkaline phosphatase, alanine am inotransferase (ALT; SGPT), as partate aminotransferase (AST; 
SGOT), bilirubin (total and direct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, carbon dioxide (CO2), chloride, creatinine, creatinin e phosphokinase (CPK), glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium, 
total protein, and uric acid.   
At Screening (Visit 1)  and Week 4 (Visit 6-EOT/ET) - For WOCBP a urine pregnancy test will 
be performed and must be negative for subjects to be enrolled. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal and Clinically Significant Results 
The Investigator must categori ze all abnormal hematology and chemistry laboratory values as 
either clinically significant (C S) or not clinically significant (NCS). Clinical significance is 
defined as any variation in labo ratory parameters, which has medi cal consequences that result in 
an alteration in the subject’s medical care. In cas e of CS laboratory result s, the Investigator will

indicate their level of agreement to a statement (0 = no symptoms, 100 = worst possible 
symptoms) by [CONTACT_1299] a single vertical on the scal e. The subject’s completed VAS will become 
the source document and the response, measured in mm from the left, will be transcribed into the 
CRF. 
 
The VAS will be administered at Screening, Day 4 , Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 3 and Week 4. 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.[ADDRESS_811549] will 
be asked to read a standardized  eye chart (ETDRS).  Detailed instructions on Visual Acuity 
Testing are provided in the Study Ma nual.  Subjects should be encouraged to make an effort to 
read as many letters as possible on the chart. Di stance visual acuity only will be measured. The 
right eye should be tested first. Vi sual acuity will be measured at Screening, Day 4 , Week 1 , 
Week 2, Week 3  and Week 4. 
9.1.8 IOP Measurements 
IOP measurements will be taken using an accep ted tonometry method, which includes pneumatic 
tonometry, Tono-Pen applanation tonometry or Goldmann applanation tomnometry – depending 
on the preferred method at each site.  Once a subject has enrolled in the study, the same 
tonometry method will be used for that subject throughout the duration of the study . IOP will be 
measured at Screening , Day 4, Week 1, Week [ADDRESS_811550] will be seated during the examination.  See Appendix 1 for grading scales. ACC grade 
will be determined and for Grade 1+ and lower on ly, a numerical cell count will be obtained. Slit 
lamp examination will be completed at Screening , Day 4, Week 1, Week [ADDRESS_811551] of five consecutive readings will be discarded, and the 
average of the remaining three will be recorded . In cases where a pachymeter is used that

diary with them to Visit 3 through Visit 6 to be reviewed by [CONTACT_7893]. The site staff will 
ensure compliance and review/ remind th e subject on instructions as needed. 
 
Missed Doses:  If subjects forget to take a dose at the scheduled time, they should take that dose 
as soon as they remember and record th e time of dosing in the dosing diary. 
 
Exceptions: Subjects should not take a “make-up”  dose within one hour of another scheduled 
dose. Instead they should take the next sche duled dose and note the missed dose on the dosing 
diary.

treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with th e use of the study drug 
whether or not it is considered related to the study drug. AEs will be collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent form through [ADDRESS_811554] udy drug administration. 
 
Abnormal laboratory and other abno rmal investigational findings (i.e., physical exam) should not 
be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment 
discontinuation or are otherwise co nsidered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093].  In cases of 
surgical or diagnostic procedures , the condition/illness l eading to such a procedure is considered 
as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered 
as the AE, and the death is considered as its outcome.

Proprietary and Confidential   
Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events 
 
Pre-existing medical conditions/signs/symptoms pr esent before the screening period that do not 
worsen in severity or frequency during the study  are defined as baseline medical conditions, and 
are not to be considered AEs. 
 
All AEs must be recorded in the site’s study records and th e AE CRF with the following 
information:  
1. Relationship to Study Drug:  The Investigator  must assess whether they consider an AE 
to be drug-related. In assessing this relations hip, the Investigator must use information 
about the drug as outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB), the s ubject’s pre-existent 
medical conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration.  
 
The following definitions will be used: 
 
• Definitely or possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluate d, are considered by [CONTACT_737] (or 
other qualified physician) to have at l east a possible relationship to study drug. 
 • Unlikely or not related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluate d, are considered by [CONTACT_737] (or 
other qualified physician) to have no relationship, or an  unlikely possibility of a 
relationship, to study drug. 
 
2. Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to use their medi cal judgment to assess 
the severity of the AE. 
 The following are guidelines to be used by [CONTACT_612103]:

4. Frequency: whether the event is a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], recurrent or continuous. 
5. Action taken. 
6. Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below. 
7. Outcome: resolved, resolved/ with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (only for 
subjects that are lost to follow-up). 
 
The Investigator (or designee) should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis , and not the individual 
signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, should be documented in the subject’s source documentation and the CRF unless the etiology of  the event is unknown.   An assessment should 
be made at each visit (or more frequently if nece ssary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to study drug, th e interventions required to  treat it and the outcome. 
9.2.2 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that 
was present prior to dosing and exacer bates after the first dose of study drug. 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death: This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. car accident).  If a subject 
dies during the study and an autopsy is performe d, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor. 
• Life-threatening experience. Life-threatening means that the patient was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurr ed (i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form). 
• Required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Exceptions will be hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a) 
elective or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened si nce the start of study drug or b) treatment 
on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Congenital anomaly 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediatel y life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767]  a SAE when, based upon medical judgment,

outcomes listed above. 
9.2.4 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure for ADX-102. 
9.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator is respon sible for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causality , to the Sponsor or 
their designated representative by [CONTACT_36984] (or email) within [ADDRESS_811555] ration. At a minimum, a description of the 
event and the Investigator’s judgment of causalit y must be provided at the time of the initial 
report. These preliminary reports will be follo wed by [CONTACT_612104][INVESTIGATOR_3103] , autopsy reports, and other do cuments when requested and 
applicable. 
 
Complications or progression of an initial SAE must be reported as a follow-up SAE Report to 
the original SAE, regardless of when the follow-up information is received by [CONTACT_737].  A follow-up SAE Report must be submitted within  [ADDRESS_811556] in the 
Study Manual .  
 The procedures for reporting SAEs are as follows: 
 
• Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form”.  The Investigator may contact 
[CONTACT_612105] e for assistance with SAE reporting. 
• Fax or email the SAE Form to the attenti on of Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
 The original copy of the SAE Report Form and th e fax confirmation sheet (or email) must be 
kept with the source docume ntation at the study site. 
 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.[ADDRESS_811557] continued or wit hdrew from study participation.  
 
If the SAE was not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be 
related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgently require further information 
from the Investigator for regul atory authority reporting. The S ponsor may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification to info rm all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that 
this SAE has been reported.  
The Investigator and study pers onnel should institute any suppleme ntal investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This  may include clinical laboratory 
tests not specified in the protoc ol, histopathologic examinations, or  consultations with specialists. 
The Sponsor or their designee may also request the Investigator to conduct supplemental assessments. 
 
The Investigator should notify Pharmacovigilance of any SAE occurring after a subject has 
withdrawn from the study when such a SAE occurs  within [ADDRESS_811558] dose of study drug 
and may reasonably be related to the study drug. 
9.4 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be followed until clinical database lock (or stabilization/resolution if it occurs 
before database lock).  All SAEs will undergo active follow-up until resolved or the event 
becomes chronic or stable.  Follow up data for SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be 
incorporated into the safety database. 
9.[ADDRESS_811559] promptly report to his or her IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects.  This includes death from a ny cause and all serious adverse events reasonably 
or possibly associated with the use of study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs occurring at a 
site, regardless of causality, be  reported to the site’s IRB in accordance with the IRB 
requirements.

Proprietary and Confidential   
ADX-102 has been filed under an IND application with the US FDA.  An SAE may require 
safety reports to be filed to re gulatory agencies if the SAE is  related to the study drug and is 
unexpected based upon the current Inve stigator’s Brochure.  In this  case, the Investigator will 
receive a copy of the safety report as submitted to the regulatory agencies.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting the safety report (initia l and follow up) or other safety information 
(e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) to the IRB in accordance with the IRB requirements and 
maintain a copy in their files. 
9.[ADDRESS_811560] be reported to 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of  learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnanc y should be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, deta ils of the birth, and th e presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s so urce documents and a Pregnancy Notification and 
Outcome Form and reported by [CONTACT_612106] 9.3 . A pregnancy, by [CONTACT_5071], is not a SAE.   Pregnancy 
follow-up should also be recorded and should incl ude an assessment of the possible relationship 
to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy-related SAE (e.g. spontaneous 
abortion) or any other SAE expe rienced during pregnancy must be recorded on a separate SAE 
Report Form and reported per SAE re porting procedures in Section 9.3.

This is a multicenter, randomized, double masked, parallel group study.   
 
  
 
Subjects are eligible for enrolment with A CC Grade 1+ to 3+ disease. However, if ≥ [ADDRESS_811561] Grade 1+ ACC severi ty further enrolment of ACC Grade 1+ severity 
will be halted as the study populat ion is designed to represent a range of NAU subjects and not 
predominantly Grade 1+ disease.  
 
Group 1 ADX-102 ophthalmic solution (0.5%)  Group [ADDRESS_811562] (DSMB) 
An independent data safety monitoring board (D SMB) will be established. They will review all 
available safety data after approximately [ADDRESS_811563] completed the study visit 7. The 
assessment of safety will be determined fr om ophthalmologic endpoints including slit lamp 
examinations, ocular scores, visual acuity and IOP, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, hematology and chemistry laborator y testing, use of concomitant medications, and 
review of adverse events (AEs).  Based on the safety data provided, the DSMB will determine if it is acceptable to continue the study or modify  the study design as appropriate. Additional 
DSMB reviews will occur throughout the trial approximately every [ADDRESS_811564] non-missing value obtained 
prior to initiation of  study drug, nominally the Screening Visit. 
10.5 Analysis Populations 
The statistical analysis will be based on the analysis populations as defined below

any study assessments.  Subjects in this population will be analyzed 
according to the treatment which they received.  All safety analyses will be based on this population 
ITT population The intent-to-treat population (ITT) is  the population of all subjects who 
are randomized into a treatment group.  Subjects in this population will 
be analyzed according to the treat ment group to which they were 
randomized. This population will be us ed for analyses of efficacy and 
pre-study/baseline ch aracteristics. 
PP population The per protocol (PP) po pulation is the subset of  ITT subjects who meet 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria , remain on study medication, comply 
with treatment instructions, and do not have any signi ficant protocol 
deviations or violations. Rescued subjects will not be excluded from PP solely on the basis of having been rescued and withdrawal of study medication and withdrawal from the study.  Significant protocol 
violations prior to being rescued ma y exclude a rescued subject from the 
PP.  Subjects in this population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they receive. 
10.[ADDRESS_811566] characteristics will be obtained at the Screening/Visit 1  prior to randomization and will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_6654].  Su mmaries will include descriptive statistics for 
continuous measures (sample size, mean, standa rd deviation, median, minimum, maximum) and 
for categorical measures (sample size, frequency and percentages).

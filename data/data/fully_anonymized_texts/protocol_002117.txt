1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Idiopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis (I PF) is a chronic disease of unknown aetiology  that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_581832], resulting in disabling dyspnoea
and poor gas exchange. The average life expectancy  in IPF patients is 2- 3 years. 
The only  drug that has been registered in a number of countries for the treatment of I PF is
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]. It was launched in Japan in 2008 under the brand name [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_369248]®and was 
approved for the treatme nt of mild -to-moderate IPF in Europe and Canada in 2011 (under the 
brand name [CONTACT_652806]®). Following the successful completion of a third Phase III tr ial (PI[INVESTIGATOR_16335] -
016, ASCEND) pi[INVESTIGATOR_847089] y approved by [CONTACT_847107]. 
Other pharmacologic options include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cy clophosphamide, and 
N-acety l cysteine, albeit none of these has been proven efficacious in clinical trials compared 
with placebo, and none is indicated for the treatment of I PF. Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_847090], the medical need for efficacious and 
safe treatment of IPF remains high.
Nintedanib has been developed for the treatment of I PF and for several cancer t ypes in two 
separate clinical development programmes. 
In IPF the clinical proof of concept for nintedanib was established in the 52 -week phase II 
trial 1199.30 ( P11-[ZIP_CODE]) . Based on this trial, it was considered that nintedanib may  confer 
clinical benefit to patients with I PF with acceptable safet y.
Two phase III international, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials of identical study  design 
1199.32 and 1199.34 confirmed the efficacy  and safet y of nintedanib 150 mg bid versus 
placebo in patients with IPF (P14-
[ZIP_CODE]) (refer to Section 1.2). Based on the overall 
evidence, nintedanib was approved b y the US FDA for the treatment of IPF in October 2014. 
The current study 1199.33 is a long -term extension study  of the Phase III trials and such it is 
conducted to evaluate the long- term safet y and tolerability  of nintedanib in IPF.  
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Nintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the Platelet Derived Growth 
Factor Receptor (PDGFR) α and β, Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) 1 -3, and 
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR). Nintedanib binds competitively  to 
the ATP binding pocket of these receptors and blocks the intracellular signalling which is 
crucial for the proliferation, migration, and transformation of fibroblasts, representing 
essential mechanisms of the I PF pathology . In addition, nintedanib inhibits Flt -3, Lck, Ly n, 
and Src kinases ( U07-1248 ).
Nintedanib is currentl y in clinical development for several ty pes of cancer. In line with the 
pre-clinical findings, the clinical development programme has provided data suggesting that

[ADDRESS_1177837] a number of advanced malignancies including lung, ovarian, 
kidney , liver, and colorectal cancer. 
Inhibition of FGFR -1 and PDGFR has been proposed as effective principle for the treatment 
of IPF(P07-[ZIP_CODE]) . Furthermore, V EGF Rinhibition may  also have favourable effects, 
although the precise role of down -regulation of VEGF -mediated actions in I PF has not y et 
been full y elucidated (R07-0002) . Oral administration of nintedanib to rats with bleomy cin-
induced lung fibrosis resulted in nearl y complete attenuation of fibrosis histologicall y not 
only when started at day  [ADDRESS_1177838]. Maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax) occurred [ADDRESS_1177839]. The gMean terminal half -life (t 1/2) was 18 hours after intravenous administration. The 
major route of elimination of total [14C] radioactivity  was via the faeces / biliary  excretion, 
while the contribution of renal excretion was low (0.7% of an orally  administered radioactive 
dose). An absolute bioavailability  of slightl y below 5% was observed b y an intra -individual 
comparison of dose normali zed AUC of [ADDRESS_1177840] 23% compared to an absolute bioavailability of the parent alone of about 5%, thereb y 
confirming the large amount of metabolite formed during intestinal and/or hepatic first pass 
metabolism. 
The by  [CONTACT_847108] 1202 formed by  [CONTACT_847109] 1202- glucuronide. The glucuronidation o f 
BIBF 1202 was mainl y through UGT1A1 (liver and intestine) and UGT1A7, UGT1A8 and 
UGT1A10 (intestine). Drug -drug interactions based on cy tochrome P450 dependent 
pathway s are not expected for 
nintedanib .
In vitro transporter profiling of BIBF [ADDRESS_1177841] of xenobiotics interacting with P- gp is currentl y 
not known.
In the IPF phase II proof -of-concept trial 1199.30, 432 patients with consistent I PF were 
randomized, with baseline characteristics comparable across groups. The results of the 
primary  endpoint analyses, annual rate of FVC decline, were: 0.19 L (placebo); 0.17 L  (50 
mg qd); 0.21 L (50 mg bid); 0.16 L  (100 mg bid); and 0.06 L (150 mg bid: -68% reduction in 
rate of dec line vs. placebo, p=0.0136; closed -testing multiplicity  corrected: p=0.0639). At 
end of study , FVC% pred was better preserved in the 100 mg bid (p=0.0314) and 150 mg bid 
(p=0.0002) groups when compared to placebo. FVC signal robustness was supported b y 
results of body  plethy smography  and ox ygen saturation. Compared to placebo, fewer patients 
had acute exacerbations in the 150 mg bid group (p=0.0150), and there were a greater number 
of SGRQ 4-point scale responders in the 100 mg bid (p=0.0069) and 150 mg bid (p=0.0341) 
groups.  No effect was observed on DL COand 6 -MWT. The number of deaths was not

more frequent with 150 mg bid (37.6%; 31.8%), but less with 100 mg bid (16.3% ; 15.1%), 
compared to placebo (28.2%; 24.7%).
The adverse events most frequentl y leading to discontinuation were diarrhoea, nausea, and 
vomiting (in the group receiving 150 mg twice a day as compared with those receiving 
placebo, the respective rates were 11.8% vs. 0%, 4.7% vs. 0%, and 2.4% vs. 1.2%). Among 
the 85 patients in the group receiving 150 mg of the study  drug twice a day , 4 (4.7%) had 
serious gastrointestinal events and 5 (5.9%) had severe gastrointestinal events, especiall y 
diarrhoea, as compare d with no patients in the placebo group.
Clinically  significant elevations in liver enzy mes levels (at least three times the upper limit of 
the normal range for ALT or AST at an y time after baseline) were observed in 6 patients in 
the group receiving 150 m g of nintedanib twice a day  (7.1%), 1 in the group receiving 100 
mg twice a day  and none in the placebo group. All aminotransferase levels normalized or 
decreased from elevated levels with continued treatment (in 3 patients receiving 150 mg 
twice a day  and 1 patient receiving 100 mg twice a day ), with a dose reduction (from 150 mg 
twice a day  to 100 mg twice a day  in 1 patient), or with withdrawal of the drug (in 2 patients 
receiving 150 mg twice a day ). 
For patients of the Phase II study  participation in the open label rollover trial 1199.35 was 
offered. This study  is currently  ongoing. 
Overall, it was considered that nintedanib may  confer clinical benefit to patients with I PF 
with an acceptable safet y profile. The benefit/risk assessment of the Phase II trial results 
justified initiation of 2 large Ph ase III trials. Trials 1199.32 ( U13-2381-01) and 1199.34 
(U13-2382 -01), which are the parent trials of the current 1199.33 trial, evaluated the safet y 
andefficacy  of the 150 mgbid dose versus placebo when given over 52 weeks. 
In total 515 patients were randomised in study  1199.32 and 551 patients in study  1199.34. 
The primary  endpoint of the annual rate of decline in FVC was met in both studies. I n stud y 
1199.32 the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was - 239.91 mL /year in the placebo 
group and - 114.65 mL/ year in the nintedanib group. The difference between treatment groups 
was 125.26 mL /year (95% CI : 77.68, 172.84) and was statistically significant (p<0.0001). In 
study  1199.34 the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was -207.32 mL/y ear in the placebo 
group and - 113.59 mL/ year in the nintedanib group. The difference between the treatment 
groups was 93.73 mL /year (95% CI: 44.78, 142.68) and was stat isticall y significant 
(p=0.0002). 
Change from baseline in SGRQ total score at 52 weeks was a key  secondary  endpoint in the 
studies. I n study  1199.32 there was a small difference between the treatment groups in favo ur 
of nintedanib: -0.05 (95% CI : - 2.40, 2.50), which was not statistically  significant (p=0.966). 
In stud y 1199.34 the difference between the treatment groups was -2.69 (95% CI :-4.95, -
0.43) in favour of nintedanib and was statisticall y significant (p=0.0197).

As expected, the most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal disorders. Diarrhoea was reported 
in 61.5% of the patients in the nintedanib group in st udy 1199.32 and in 63.2% of the patients 
in study  1199.34 compared to 18.6% and 18.3% in the placebo group, respectivel y. Liver 
enzy me elevations were more frequent in the nintedanib group than in the placebo group in 
both studies: aspartate aminotransfera se [AST] and/or alanine aminotransferase [AL T] 
≥3xUL N was observed in 4.9% of the patients in the nintedanib group versus 0.5% of the 
patients in the placebo group in study  1199.32 and in 5.2% of the patients in the nintedanib

Moreover it is designed to determine the tolerability  and safet y of nintedanib and to follow up 
on survival in I PF patients treated for a long period.
Throughout this protocol, each time “parent trial” is quoted it refers to the 1199.32 and 
1199.34 trials (EudraCT no. 2010

2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The primar y objective is to assess long term safet y of treatment with oral nintedanib in 
patients with I diopathic Pulmonary  Fibrosis (I PF).
Please refer to Section [ADDRESS_1177845], reproducible, statistically  significant, and clinically  meaningful 
effects on the decline in lung function a s measured by  [CONTACT_169336]. In two large, international, 
placebo
-controlled phase III trials of identical design, ninteda nib 150 mg bid statistically  and 
clinically  significantl y reduced the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks compared 
with placebo indicating a relative difference of approximately  50% between nintedanib and 
placebo. T his effect of nintedanib is consi dered c onsistent with slowing disease progression 
as measured b y FVC.
The risks of treatment with nintedanib are primarily related to the gastrointestinal tract 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain) and to increases in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, 
ALK P, gamma -GT) and bilirubin. Also weight decrease and decreased appetite have 
frequentl y been reported in studies with nintedanib. Moreover, based on experience with 
other ty rosine kinase inhibitors, impairment of immune and of kidney function, intestinal 
perforations, increases in blood pressure as well as potential bleeding and thrombotic events
should be carefully  monitored and evaluated in clinical trials. In patients who develop severe
symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity  not amenable to sy mptomatic tr
eatment with standard
measures, severe liver enzy me elevations, severe drug -related infections, or uncontrolled
hypertension, treatment with nintedanib must be discontinued and appropriate therapeutic
measures taken (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . Liver enzy mes must be followed closely  during 
treatment with nintedanib.

[ADDRESS_1177846] be discontinued in 
the event of hepatic toxicity  and further treatment withheld until recove ry of the abnormal 
laboratory  parameters (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Patients with I PF may  benefit from lesser decline in lung function and hence slower disease
progression as a result of treatment with nintedanib. I n additio n, nintedanib may  reduce the 
risk of acute IPF exacerbations and worsening of patient ’s quality  of life. Finally , nintedanib
may ultimatel y be found to reduce mortality . Overall, the benefit/risk profile of nintedanib, as 
established during the phase II and III trials is interpreted as favourable for the treatment o f 
IPF
.
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by  
[CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this study  requires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations of selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients’ 
safet y.
Patients who are offered to enter this open label extension trial mus t have participated in a 
phase III parent trial (1199.32 or 1199.34) for one y ear. All pat ients will be treated with 
active drug. Patients who have not tolerated the blinded study  drug or discontinued for any  
reason are not eligibl e for the extension trial. P atients who were randomized to placebo in the 
parent trial will be receiving the active drug for the first time. Similar safety monitoring
procedures as in the phase III trials will be applied .
The routine safet y monitoring established in the parent study  is considered appropriate for the 
long term 
follow -up of the patients. It consists of regular visits to the investigational site, 
blood analy ses and specific monitoring procedures to follow -up potential hepatic enz yme 
elevation. In case it is considered adequate b y the i nvestigator, the dose of nintedanib may be 
reduced to 100 mg bid or dosing may  be interrupted.

Nintedanib will be supplied by  [CONTACT_15611] & Co. KG.
4.1.[ADDRESS_1177861]
All patients will be treated with nintedanib in this trial; there is no active comparator or 
placebo.
Substance: nintedanib
Pharmaceutical form: Soft gelatin capsule
Source: BI Pharma GmbH Co. KG
Unit strengths: 150 mg , 100 mg
Posology : Twice dail y(bid)
Route of administration: Oral (swallowed)
4.1.2 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
In the parent blind phase III trials (1199. 32 and 1199.34) patients are assigned either a ctive 
drug ( nintedanib 150 mg bid) or placebo. In case patients experience adverse events related to 
drug tolerability , a dose reduction to 100 mg bid isallowed (both in active or placebo group).
At the end of treatment (Visit 9) in the parent trials, pat ients will be taking either 150 mg bid 
blinded study  medication (active drug or placebo) or 100 mg bid blinded study  medication 
(active drug or placebo) if their dose was permanently reduced during the trial.
Patients taking 150 mg bid blinded study  medica tion(active drug or placebo) in the parent 
trial will be treated with nintedanib 150 mg bid in the current extension trial .
Patients who had the dose reduced to 100 mg bid (active drug or placebo) in the parent trial 
will be allowed to be treated with nintedanib [ADDRESS_1177862] a chance to get the 
full dose in the extension trial. 
The daily  dose of 
nintedanib will be decided at Visit 2 based on discussi on between the 
patient and the investigator.

will be used to assign medication numbers to eligible patients. Distribution of nintedanib to 
sites will be triggered b y IVRS/ IWRS.
Details on the IVRS/I WRS sy stem are provided in the I SF.
After conclusion and unblinding of the parent trials, patients who received 100 mg bid (active 
drug or placebo ) will also be allowed to increase their nintedanib dose to 150 mg bid, if this 
wasnot already  performed at the beginning of the extension trial and if it is medically 
justified. I n this situation, dose increase will need to be assigned through IVRS/I WRS during 
an additional visit (refer to Section 6.2.4).
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
Based on the phase IIsafety  and dose -finding trial 1199.30, a dose of 150 mg bid was 
selected for confirmatory phase IIItrials (1199.32/.34) ( U07-1248). With 150 mg bid, the 
limit of tolera bility  in IPF patients is considered to be reached. Lower doses may not ensure 
full efficacy  benefit. However, in case of lack of tolerability , the dose may be reduced
temporaril y or permanently to 100 mg bid. 
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
At V isit 2 patients who meet all eligibility  criteria will be assigned trial drug :nintedanib
either 150 mg or 100 mg bid (refer to Section 4.1.2 ). 
Boxes covering 4 weeks + 1 week reserve treatment will be dispensed to the patient:
-1 box at day  1 (V isit 2 );
-2 boxes at Visit 4;
-3 boxes at V isits 6, 7 and 8 ;
-[ADDRESS_1177863] should 
only be dispensed to participating patients according to the protocol b y authorised personnel 
as documented in the form “ Trial Staff List ”. 
Study  drug will be administered orall y on a twice daily  basis (bid). The patients should 
swallow the study  medication unchewed together with a glass of water (~250 mL ), and 
should observe a dose interval of 12 hours. Study  drug should be taken at the same time every  
day (between 06:00 and 11:00 in the morning, and between 18:00 and 23:00 in the evening).
Because nintedanib may cause stomach discomfort, it is recommended to take the drug after
food consumption .

Restrictions
[IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment
Investigational therap y is not allowed during the entire study  period and must not 
have been introduced in the interval between parent trial and enrolme nt into this 
extension trial . 
Nintedanib is an anti -fibrotic kinase inhibitor which has been shown to have anti -
angiogenic properties. Inhibition of angiogenesis may  increase susceptibility  to 
bleeding. Therefore, concomitant anticoagulation, fibrinoly sisor high- dose 
antiplatelet therap y is contra -indicated (refer to Section 3.3.3 [4 weeks washout]). 
Patients who require fibrinolysis, full -dose therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g. vitamin K 
antagonists, dabigatran, heparin, hirud in), or high dose antiplatelet therap y are to be 
withdrawn. Proph ylactic low dose heparin or heparin flush as needed for maintenance 
of an indwelling intravenous device (e.g. enoxaparin 4000 I U s.c.per day ), as well as 
prophy lactic use of antiplatelet the rapy (e.g. acet yl salicy lic acid up to 325 mg/d, or 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_16367] 75 mg/d, or equivalent doses of other antiplatelet therap y) should be 
allowed.
The concomitant administration of nintedanib with any drugs which are likely  to 
increase gastrointestinal even tssuch as diarrhoea , nausea, vomiting, is discouraged.

5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a 
pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any  AE which results in death, is immediately  
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs 
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], is a congenital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed seri ous for 
any other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition s.
Every  new occurrence of cancer will be reported as a SAE regardless of the duration between 
discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the cancer.
Intensit y of adverse event
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) which is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge,

history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms.
Additional information for Japan: The reason for the decision on causal relationship needs to 
be provided in the eCRF.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal re lationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product
administered and the AE. 
Worsening of the underly ing disease or other pre- existing conditions
Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions will be recorded as an 
(S)AE in the e CRF.
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination, and laboratory  test results
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laborator y test results will be 
recorded as an (S) AE in the e CRF , if they  are judged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093].
Protocol -specified significant events
Similar to the parent trials, t he following are considered as Protocol -specified significant 
events:
Hepatic injury  defined by  [CONTACT_847113]/or AL T ≥ [ADDRESS_1177886] combined 
with an elevation of bilirubin ≥ 2 fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample.
Patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to Section 
10.1.1 ofthis clinical trial protocol and the “DILI checklist” provided in ISF.
Adverse events relating to gastrointestinal perforation.
Protocol -specified significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to 
Serious Adverse Events, even if the y do not meet any of the seriousness criteria –for details 
please see Section 5.3.7 .

All adverse events , serious and non- serious, occurring during the course of the clinical trial 
(i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the observational period of 28 day s) 
willbe collected, documented and reported to the sponsor by  [CONTACT_847114] / SAE reporting forms . Reporting will be done according to the specific 
definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse Event Reporting’ section of the
Investigator Site File.
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness ,and action taken with the investigational drug. The 
investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational drug to all AEs as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The investigator also has the responsibility  to report AEs occurring in a certain period (28 
days)after a patient completes the study  drug administration .After this defined period all 
SAEs related to the stud y drug and/or stud y design have to be reported b y the investigator.
Theinvestigator must report the following events via telephone/fax using the SAE form 
immediately  (within 24 hours or the next bus iness day  whichever is shorter) to the sponsor: 
SAEs and non-serious AEs occurring at the same time as an SAE and/or which are medicall y 
related to the SAE(s), and protocol -specified significant events. 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In 
order to support the investigator with the identification of these “alway s serious adverse 
events”, if a non serious AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query  will be 
raised. The investigator must verify the description and seriousness of the event. If the event 
description is correct, the item “serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in 
expedited fashion following the same procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be foun d in the I SF.
Additional information for Japan: This information must be also reported immediately to the 
head of the trial site . 
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE report has to be 
provided. SAEs and non- serious AEs must includ e a causal relationship assessment made b y 
the investigator .
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(country -specific contact [CONTACT_21644] I nvestigator Site File). This 
imme diate report is required irrespective of whether the investigational product has been 
administered or not and irrespective of causal relationship. I t also applies if new information 
to existing SAEs or protocol-specified significant events becomes availabl e. 
Pregnancy
As mentioned above, due to the reprotoxic potential of nintedanib , a patient must not become 
pregnant while treated with nintedanib and until 3 months after end of treatment.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a multicenter, multi -national, open -label clinical trial to investigate the long term 
safet y of nintedanib in patients with I PF previously  treated in a double -blind phase III
placebo controlled trial (1199.32 or 1199.34).
This statistical paragraph deals with the anal yses to be performed on the extension trial only . 
Although data of parent trial will not be described in the scope of these analyses, they will be 
taken into account for adv erse events anal yses, as described in Section 7.3.4 .
As the main objective of this extension trial is to study  long -term safet y, only  descriptive 
statistics will be used. 
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
All analy ses in th is trial are descriptive and exploratory innature. No formal statistical 
inferences are foreseen.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
The treated set (TS) will consist of all patients who received at least one dose of open -label 
study  medication.
The definition of impo rtant protocol violations (IPV)will be specified in the trial statistical 
analysis plan (TSAP). These IPV definitions will include consideration of important 
violations of entry  criteria, treatment non -compliance, prohibited medications and inadequate 
follow-up of hepatic events.
Patients will be analy sed according to their randomized treatment group in previous studies 
1199.32/34, and overall.
The last available value between visit 1 and visit 2 (before first trial drug intake) will be 
considered as the b aseline, for this extension trial.
The main statistical analy sesas described below will be performed based on all data collected 
up to the third interim database lock date (see section 7.4 ). Afterwards, only adverse events 
and concomitant treatments listings will be provided.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
The primary  objective of the study  is to assess the safet yof nintedanib , so please refer to

10.1.1 Clinical Evaluation of Liver Injury
[IP_ADDRESS] Introduction
Alterations of liver laboratory  parameters, as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] andSection [IP_ADDRESS]
(Protocol -Specified Significant Events), are to be further evaluated using the following 
procedures.
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures
Repeat the following laboratory  tests: ALT, AST, and bilirubin (total and direct) - within 48 
to 72 hours and provide additional blood sample to the central laboratory for automatic reflex 
testing of the below listed laboratory  parameters. Only  in case whereb y the central laboratory 
is not immediately  available (e.g. if the logistics are such that the p atient’s repeat specimen 
would not reach the central laboratory  in a reasonable timeframe), ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
(total and direct) must be evaluated b y local laboratory and results must be made available to 
the investigator and to BI as soon as possibl e.
If ALT and/or AST ≥3 fold UL N combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2 fold UL N 
are confirmed, the laboratory  parameters described below willbe made available to the
investigator and to BI as soon as possible.
Clinical chemistry
Alkaline phosphatase, albumin, PT or INR, CK, CK -MB, c eruloplasmin, α -1 antitry psin, 
transfe rrin, am ylase, lipase, fasting glucose, cholesterol, trigl ycerides
Serology
Hepatitis A (Anti -IgM, Anti -IgG), Hepatitis B (HbsAg, Anti -HBs, DNA), Hepatitis C (Anti -
HCV, RNA if Anti -HCV positive), He patitis D (Anti -IgM, Anti -IgG), Hepatitis E (Anti -
HEV, Anti -HEV IgM, RNA if Anti- HEV IgM positive), Anti -Smooth Muscle antibody

patients without access to treatment will continue 
to receive nintedanib in this trial until a reason 
for discontinuation is met.

6.2.5. Period after the database lock for the final 
analysis
After the database lock for the final analy sis 
(refer to section 7.3) and once consent has been 
provided, the remaining patients in the trial 
(patients without access to nintedanib outside the 
clinical trial) will be offered continuation of 
treatment within the trial. This period will consist 
of study visits every  16 weeks (±2 weeks) where 
the following procedures will be conducted:
-Assessment o f adverse events and conco mitant 
therap y since last visit;
-Dispensation of trial drug .
Patients will continue to receive treatment until 
they meet a reason for discontinuation (refer to 
section 3. 3.4) or until access to nintedanib is 
obtained outside th e clinical trial. 
Dose reductions, interruptions and re -escalations 
are possible at an y time during the scheduled 
study  visits or between visits to manage adverse 
events.
End of treatment and follow up visits have to be 
performed to conclude the treatment period and 
trial participation.

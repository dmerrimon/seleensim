AIMS____________________________________________________________
_______________  
The primary aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_871329]  a clinically meaningful, patient -
centric, and pragmatic protocol to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different 
modalities  for achievement of the ideal balance between analgesia and functional mobility 
following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  
 We propose a study by [CONTACT_871341] -centered  inquiry will quantify the 
relative value of various outcome measures believed to be most meaningful to this patient 
population.  Emphasis on patient experience and guided reflection combined with 
objective  data will establish the optimal methodology for comparing different techniques 
of perioperative analgesia. We will identify those outcome measures that most accurately 
reflect the overall patient experience as well as the clinical result.  Patient input h as been 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_871330], and we propose a 
mechanism by [CONTACT_871342], and ultimately clinical care.  
In addition to applying a patient -centric perspective towards the identification of 
meaningful outcome measures, we intend to establish the feasibility  and cost-
efficiency  of our study design and protocol.  Ease of implementation, and seamless 
integration of clinical measures and data collectio n into routine workflow is necessary in 
order for the protocol to be attractive to other centers as part of a future multi -center 
trial. Previous orthopaedic surgery randomized controlled trials have set the precedence 
that such studies can be completed in  an economical manner when such aspects of design 
are carefully considered (21).  Through promotion of collaborative relationships between 
and continued engagement of the orthop aedic, anesthetic, nursing, and postoperative 
rehabilitative teams, the final protocol will allow all participants – care givers and patients 
alike - to feel invested and unburdened by [CONTACT_219960].  
 Though the primary goals of the project pertain to estab lishment and application of 
proper scientific methodology to the clinical query addressing the most efficacious method Medical University of South Carolina  
Protocol  
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216874]  compi[INVESTIGATOR_871331], established collegial relationships across a number of disciplines, and 
effected a mechanism of meaningful patient engagement in design of a study that will be 
well-positioned to compete for the expected Patient -Centered Outcomes Research 
Institute (PCORI) funding via the Large Pragmatic Studies to Evaluate Patient —Centered 
Outcomes opportunity in the Spring of 2016  
 
 
 
 
 
B. BACKGROUND AND 
SIGNIFICANCE____________________________________________________
_____  
Accor ding to the CDC, over 700,000 TKA’s are performed in the [LOCATION_002] 
annually. That number continues to rise exponentially, and is predicted to eclipse 3 million 
procedures by 2030 (14).  Though 98% of patients report pain relief following TKA, 
unfortunately up to one -third fail to achieve significant functional improvements (7).  
Nearly 20% of primary TK A patients report they are dissatisfied with their outcome, and 
up to 33% experience some residual symptoms (4, 17) .  Various associative factors have 
been suggested to influence outcome, ranging from socioeconomic  factors, to depressed 
mood, age, gender, su Carolina rgical technique, and comorbid conditions (3, 13) .   
 The early postoperative period following total knee arthroplasty is widely believed 
to be critically importan t for regaining range of motion and mobility in order to optimize 
the ultimate clinical outcome and minimize the risk of complications including venous 
thromboembolic events (15).  Perioperative analgesia for TKA patients has evolved 
considerably since the popularization of the procedure decades ago. Historically, 
perioperative interventions such as general anesthesia and patient -controlled analgesia 
pumps (PCAs) have aggressively treated postoperative pain, but have been associated 
with side effects including lethargy, somnolence, nausea, and mental status changes, all 
of which have a detrimental effect on early mobility. Furthermore, contemporary emphasis 
on value in healthcare has led to efforts to promote “rapid recovery” programs th at 
facilitate early mobilization and discharge, thereby [CONTACT_871343].  Recent trends in perioperative analgesic strategies may be related to these 
evolving priorities (5, 11) .   
 Recently, with growing appreciation of the importance of early mobilization in 
addition to pure pain control, centers across the country have trended away from general 
anesthesia and PCA’s in favor of regional anesthetic techniques (5).  A wide range of 
strategies have emerged, most of which combine either spi[INVESTIGATOR_871332] 
a spectrum of peripheral nerve blockade techniques and/or periarticular analgesic 
injection formulations (3).  Unfortunately, the rate o f institution of these varied modalities 
has outpaced the scientific evidence to support any one strategy over another.  Multiple 
randomized trials have been published comparing one combination of interventions 
against another with little consistency, repr oducibility, or generalizability in either 
methodology or results (1, 2, 8 -10, 12, 16, 18 -20, 22 -24).  The primary outcome measure 
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216875] -operative pain levels, measured either  
directly via a visual analog scale (VAS), or indirectly via quantification of analgesic 
medication requirements (1, 2, 8 -10, 12, 16, 18 -20, 22 -24).  Most of these studies have 
failed to report outcomes beyond the t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 2 or 3 day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (1, 2, 8 -10, 12, 16, 
18-20, 22 -24).  Only one study that we are aware of has presented patient reported 
outcomes (PROs) using a validated measure, the Knee Society Score, and that was  only 
recorded at discharge (22).  Increasingly studies have reported secondary outcomes to 
include objective functional measures such as the Timed -up-and-go (TUG) (7, 19).  
Functional and patient reported outcomes beyond the immediate postoperative period  are 
lacking in the literature.  The proposed study will address these evidence gaps.  
C. PRELIMINARY 
STUDIES /EXPERIENCE ______________________________________________
_________  
During residency training at the University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School, [CONTACT_871346] elected to pursue a “research -track”, which consisted of an additional year of 
training exclusively dedicated to research. Specifically, during that year [CONTACT_871347] worked 
extensively to help develop the infrastructure that would ultimately become the N IH-
funded FORCE -TJR.  Additionally, he coordinated a prospective randomized control trial 
using radiostereometric analysis to quantify polyethylene wear and femoral stem 
migration differences between conventional and highly -cross-linked polyethylene liners  in 
total hip replacement patients.  Subsequently, productive research efforts have included 
an award -winning project resourcing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to 
characterize national trends in total joint replacement.   
[CONTACT_871348]’s interest in research began during his undergraduate years when he 
spent two years in a Drosophila lab. His primary project during that time involved isolation 
of a gene important in neural development in Drosophila. He presented this research at 
the North Carolina Aca demy of Science Meeting and received an award. During medical 
school [CONTACT_871348] worked on a project to culture human keratinocytes to produce skin grafts 
for burn patients. Currently [CONTACT_871348] has active projects that include development of a 
novel regional  anesthetic technique and the evaluation of regional anesthetic techniques 
for post -operative pain management in mastectomy patients.  
[CONTACT_137387] has previously served as a successful mentor for more junior faculty, 
and has demonstrated both interest an d ability to secure extramural research funding.  In 
support of this application as a mentor, [CONTACT_137387] has recommended quarterly 
mentorship meetings.  These meetings will address study progress via benchmarks 
including the pace of recruitment, enroll ment, and follow -up.  Preliminary analyses will be 
prepared in advance of and reviewed at the mentorship meetings.  Barriers, challenges, 
and opportunities for improvement in the process will be discussed, not only for the 
current project, but also with an  eye towards optimizing subsequent study design in 
advance of planned application for PCORI funding. Of particular relevance, [CONTACT_137387] is 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a comparative effectiveness trial that has passed initial review for PCORI 
funding and is in the fina l stage prior to acceptance.  
[CONTACT_871347] & Bolin’s strong foundational experiences combined with [CONTACT_137387]’s 
exemplary track record of success suggests potential for a productive partnership and 
sound study leadership.  With the proposed timetable of ext ramural funding during the 
calendar year following the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the expectation is that the mentor -mentee 
relationship will remain necessary for initiation of a multi -center trial, but investigator 
independence will gradually be achieved during the cou rse of that trial.

D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS (including data analysis) 
__________________________________  
 
All primary  TKA patients undergoing surgery at the Medical University of South 
Carolina (MUSC) will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study.  Those with 
valgus deformity greater than 10 degrees on plain radiographs will be excluded from the 
study.  Participants will be reflective of the population of TKA candidates at MUSC, and will 
include adults over the age of 18 of both gender s and all races.  Consenting patients will 
all receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163], and will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) Continuous 
femoral nerve catheter plus single injection sciatic nerve block, 2) Adductor canal catheter 
plus selective tibial nerve bl ock, and 3) Adductor canal catheter alone.  Patients unable to 
receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_871333].  All patients will receive a standardized 
multimodal pain regimen and early mobilization.   
Preoperative data  will include basic demographics, visual  analog pain scale (VAS) 
score, range of motion, body mass index (BMI), primary insurer, coronal angular 
deformity, and baseline opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  Surgical data will include tourniquet time and implant 
type.  Time spent in pre -operative holding area, the operat ing room, and the post -
anesthesia recovery unit will be recorded. SF -12, Patient Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score (KOOS) will be collected as part of our participation in the Functi on and Outcomes 
Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement (FORCE -TJR). 
The primary outcome measure will be postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) 
score area under the curve (AUC) for 48 hours, recorded every six hours.  Pain w ill be 
measured indirectly via total in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_871334].  Functional outcome 
measures will be administered by [CONTACT_871344], who typi[INVESTIGATOR_871335].  They will document the patient’s ability to perform independent 
terminal knee extension and grade knee buckling with ambulation on a scale of 0 -2 during 
each encounter.  Additionally, in the morning of postoperative day #1, a Ka tz Index of 
Independence in Activities of Daily Living score will be calculated.  On the morning of 
postoperative day #2, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_871336], passive 
range of motion (flexion and extension), a timed up -and-go test (T UG), and calculate the 
AM-PAC (Activity Measure for Post -Acute Care) score.  Patient reported outcome 
measures, specifically SF -12, PROMIS, and KOOS will be collected at [ADDRESS_1216876] the number that corresponds to their level of satisfaction with each 
domain of their experience.   
Via partner ship with the FORCE -TJR, collection of patient -reported outcomes (PRO) 
data for arthroplasty patients at MUSC is both well -established and sophisticated.  These 
data will be available as baseline measures for this project.  Preoperative data are 
collected at a mandatory appointment 2 -3 weeks in advance of elective arthroplasty.  At 
that appointment and again at follow -up, our research coordinator  facilitates patient 
recruitment and participation with the FORCE -TJR using validated computerized survey 
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216877] with enrollment, consent, 
extraction of clinical data from the EPIC -EMR, and coordination of prescribed follow -up.  
Postoperative SF -12, PROMIS, and KOOS are collected at 6 months and 1 year via the 
FORC E-TJR, therefore the coordinator will additionally facilitate collection of these 
instruments at 6 and 12 weeks, as well as the satisfaction survey. If, in the surgeon’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the patient is doing well after surgery and does not have to return to clinic  at the 
specified time points, the surveys will be mailed to the patient with instructions on how to 
complete them. The study coordinator will be available to field study -related patient 
questions  in clinic and via telephone .  
 At three months, a random su bset of four patients from each randomization arm 
will be invited to participate in a focus group.  The purpose of the focus group will be to 
facilitate patient engagement with the hope of fulfilling our primary aim of this study, 
which is to identify the most meaningful outcome measures for perioperative analgesia 
among the TKA patients themselves.  Qualitative data obtained during the recorded 
session will prompt discussion related to the overall patient experience in addition to 
individual experiences re lated specifically to analgesia, postoperative mobility, 
transitioning to the out -patient setting, and involvement in a randomized trial.  The focus 
group will be held several months after surgery, on the MUS C campus in a private room.  
Audiotape of the fo cus group will be available to relevant study personnel only, and will be 
kept under lock and key within an office in the Department of Orthopaedics.  A preference 
survey will be developed and distributed for additional patient feedback.  
Though the main g oal of conducting this pi[INVESTIGATOR_871337] a design, we will conduct some 
preliminary hypothesis testing.  Tests on the effect of treatment upon outcomes will be 
performed using  an intent -to-treat analysis.  Preliminary estimates suggest the study will 
be adequately powered to detect a significant VAS difference of [ADDRESS_1216878] 75 patients while taking into 
account withdrawals.  The 75 patients will be randomized into the three treatment arms 
over a 6 -month recruitment period, with a 3 month follow -up for patient reported  
outcome and satisfaction data. This sample will allow us to estimate means relatively 
precisely, with 95% confidence intervals extending just 0.[ADDRESS_1216879] deviation units in 
either direction.  We will also be able to make preliminary estimates of each tre atment’s 
effectiveness on the various outcomes of interest. Such estimates can be made using 
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) (6). Effect sizes will then be estimated from the 
GLMMs in a pairwise manner, and this information will be extremely valuable for use in 
designing a larger, more definitive trial in the future.  
The study timeline calls for initiation in April of  2015, and completion of enrollment 
in October, 2015.  Three -month follow -up data will be collected by [CONTACT_218859], 
2016, which will allow for data analysis and interpretation in advance of PCORI Letter of 
Intent, anticipated to be due in spring of 2016.  
We expect to demonstrate sound scientific methodology and a fully invested multi -
disciplinary team that will define clinically meaningful though perhaps not statistically 
significant differences in efficacy, safety, patient -reported and objective out comes 
associated with various strategies of perioperative TKA pain management.  With continued 
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216880] will be strongly consid ered for 
extramural funding through the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) 
via the “Large Pragmatic Studies to Evaluate Patient -Centered Outcomes” Funding 
Announcement.   As a proposed randomized trial examining a poorly defined aspect of  
treatment that could affect nearly one million Americans per year, such a proposal meets 
the stated objectives outlined in the RFA.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_871338] a well -
formulated, novel, scientific protocol supported by [CONTACT_871345].  Furthermore, it 
will allow us to demonstrate commitment and capacity for patient engagement in the 
study design process. The ultimate goal after procurement of extramural funding is to 
expand and establish this methodology as the generalizable gold standa rd for comparative 
effectiveness studies assessing perioperative TKA analgesia, and foster the development 
of a healthcare learning environment capable of identifying the most optimal strategy for 
perioperative TKA analgesia.

c.  Potential Risks  
Risks and side effe cts of nerve blocks may include elevated blood sugars, rash, 
itching, soreness at the site of injection, and localized bleeding.  More serious 
complications, such as delayed recovery of nerve function, persistent numbness and/or 
tingling, or persistent wea kness are extremely rare.  
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216883] RISKS  
 
a.  Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 
In the outpatient clinic, at the time that the decision to proceed with primary total 
knee replacement is agreed upon , the surgeon will introduce the study to every primary 
TKR patient.  If a patient decides to participate, the full informed consent process will be 
completed during a separate p reoperative clinic visit  (a mandatory visit for all elective TJR 
patients), which occurs [ADDRESS_1216884].  It will also be explained that randomly selected 
individuals may be contact[CONTACT_582506] a focus group, though consent to 
participate in the study does not require participation in the focus group.  Consenting 
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216885] to demonstrate sound scientific methodology and a fully invested multi -
disciplinary team that will define clinically meaningful though perhaps not statisticall y 
significant differences in efficacy, safety, patient -reported and objective outcomes 
Version 7/13/[ADDRESS_1216886] will be strongly considered for 
extramural funding through the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)

expand and establish this methodology as the generalizable gold standard for comparative 
effectiveness studies assessing perioperative TKA analgesia, and foster the development 
of a healthcare learning environment capable of identifying the most  optimal strategy for 
perioperative TKA analgesia.  Identification and establishment of a new “gold standard” in 
perioperative analgesia for TKA patients has the potential to positively impact the 
perioperative experience and clinical outcomes for nearly [ADDRESS_1216887] SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS (Data and Safety Monitoring Plan)  
 
 Complicatio ns thought to be directly related to the treatment will be assessed and 
documented at each patient encounter during and beyond the study period, beginning 
with the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and continuing with the 3 week, 6 week, 3 month, 6 
month and annual  follow up visits.  Such complications will include paresthesias, 
dysesthesias, motor weakness, neuroma, persistent pain, patient falls, and hematoma.  
Other serious adverse events that may be observed following total knee arthroplasty, but 
thought to be u nrelated to the peripheral nerve block will also be noted.  Such events 
might include wound infections, venous thromboembolic events, and cardiac events, 
among others.  Individual surgeons will be responsible for such monitoring, and all 
adverse events and  complications will be reported to the PI.

Effects of bodily illusion and tDCS on SCI-related neuropathic pain
2) Objectives
Specific Aim #1: We aim to determine to what extent neuropathic pain 
following spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI) is reduced after a non-pharmacological 
treatment involving bodily illusion (BI) and transcranial Direct Current 
Stimulation (tDCS).
Specific Aim #2: We aim to determine the relationship between Body 
Representation (BR) and neuropathic pain after SCI by [CONTACT_442364] (e.g. body image task) before and after the exposure to BI and 
tDCS. Electrophysiological (EEG) measures before and after exposure to 
BI and tDCS will be also investigated.
The working hypothesis is that a manipulation of the BR through a long 
exposure of BI and tDCS will reduce neuropathic pain symptom severity 
and sensory abnormalities. Moreover, this research will provide insights 
into changes of BR and EEG measures after SCI so far neglected, given the 
measures of EEG and body image task taken before and after BI-tDCS.
3) Background
Following SCI persistent neuropathic pain is a common clinical condition 
that negatively influences quality of life (QoL) and independent living of  
SCI individuals by [CONTACT_442365], mood, physical and social 
activities (Wollaars et al., 2007). Unfortunately, the neuropathic pains that 
occur after SCI are often inadequately relieved by [CONTACT_442366], with 
pharmacological gold standard treatments reducing pain by 50% or more in 
only one person out of seven (Cardenas et al., 2013). Thus, 
interdisciplinary, multimodal treatment approaches are particularly 
important to consider in this population. Indeed, our recent qualitative 
research shows that a priority of many SCI individuals who experience 
severe neuropathic pain is to have better access to non-pharmacological 
treatment options.
Research shows that non-pharmacological intervention that synergistically 
modulates neural activity with the purpose of inducing changes in body 
representation (BR) decreases neuropathic pain (Moseley, 2007; Soler et al., 
2010). In particular the combination of tDCS (a non-invasive brain 
stimulation able to modulate neural excitability, depending on the polarity 
of stimulation) and different types of bodily illusions (like, rubber hand 
illusions and walking illusion) to manipulate BR induce analgesic effects 
(Soler et al., 2010).
Body representation is a multidimensional concept requiring the integration 
and organization of multiple sensory inputs, such as somatosensory, 
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 3 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022proprioceptive and kinesthetic coming from skin, joints and muscles with 
visual information (Carruthers, 2008; Deneve & Pouget, 2004; Longo et 
al., 2010). Under normal circumstances these information are integrated to 
provide a coherent sense of one’s own body (Longo et al., 2010). BR can 
be manipulated by [CONTACT_216138]-invasive approaches that manipulates the 
interaction between vision, touch and proprioception, such as the rubber 
hand illusion (RHI) (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998; Tsakiris & Haggard, 2005) 
and walking illusion (WI) (Moseley, 2007; Soler et al., 2010). In the RHI a 
prosthetic hand brushed synchronously with a participant’s own hand is 
perceived being part of the participant’s own body. Similarly in the WI a 
participant on a wheelchair can see his/her upper body on a mirror, while 
the lower part of the body is a projection on the screen of legs in motion. 
Both illusions are able to manipulate BR through vision and proprioceptive 
manipulations and reduce neuropathic pain.
In addition the use of tDCS over specific brain areas (e,g,. motor cortex) in 
combination with bodily illusions has been used to treat neuropathic pain 
given the long lasting analgesic effect. Moreover, the modulations of 
embodiment processes for an artificial limb (e.g. RHI), such as the sense of 
body ownership, have been shown to be induced by [CONTACT_442367] (PPC) areas. There is therefore evidence that modulation of 
PPC can temporarily induce changes in body representation. 
Finally, EEG research(Boord et al., 2008; Vuckovic et al., 2014) suggests 
that SCI-related neuropathic pain is associated with increased EEG power 
spectra in the theta range (4–7 Hz) and decreased power in alpha (8–13 Hz) 
and beta (13-20 Hz). These power spectra variations are attributed to altered 
inputs from the thalamus, a phenomenon known thalamocortical 
dysrhythmia. Brain rhythms can be modulated via non-invasive 
neuromodulatory interventions. For instance, tDCS induces neuronal 
membrane excitability that leads to changes in cortical activity. Anodal 
tDCS has been shown to modulate spontaneous oscillatory brain activity in 
the resting brain (e.g., an increase in alpha and beta power) after 
stimulation(Mangia et al., 2014). In addition tDCS over posterior parietal 
cortical areas has been shown to modulate aspects of multisensory body 
representation and increase cortical response to incoming visuo-spatial 
stimuli(Grasso et al., 2020; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_442344]., 2013) important for body 
representation. 
In this protocol we aim to stimulate PPC by [CONTACT_442368] (inactive 
t-DCS) and at the participants will undergo to bodily illusion (BI) sessions.

PRE-Session (1). This session is done in a single visit of a duration of three hours, 
however, if necessary, we will  divide the tests in 2 visits over 1 week, to meet 
participants’ need. 
BR measures: A computer task (mental rotation of body parts) will be performed 
PRE and POST BI-tDCS (or BI and inactive tDCS:sham). The mental rotation of 
body parts is assumed to activate somatosensory representations, such as the body 
schema. In this task participants will be instructed to perform a computer task: the 
mental rotation task of body parts. They will observe images of hands or feet (left 
and right) on a computer screen or objects (left or right oriented) in different angle 
orientation and they will have to judge the laterality of the image (left or right). 
Reaction times will be measured and defined as a difference from image onset and 
participant’s vocal response, accuracy (correct responses) will be also evaluated.  
EEG recording at rest: A 64-channel Biosemi EEG-system will be used to record 
cortical activity under two conditions of 5 min each: while subjects will rest with 
their eyes closed (EC), and while they will rest with their eyes open (EO) keepi[INVESTIGATOR_442346] a fixation cross in the middle of a computer screen. These measures 
will be performed at baseline (PRE) and directly after treatment completion (BI-
tDCS or BI-sham) ( POST). Absolute spectral power will be calculated in the 
frequency range of 4–35 Hz, as we will focus our analysis on theta (4–7 Hz), alpha 
(8–13 Hz), low beta (13-20 Hz) and high beta (20-30 Hz).
Questionnaires: First they will be requested to report their height and weight to 
calculate body mass index (BMI). Participants will be also asked to complete 4 
questionnaires: the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), psychological 
general well-being index (PGWBI) questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory-
II (BDI-II) and the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale. We will also perform a 
pain assessment using the Pain Basic Data Set where participants will describe their 
pains and provide the Patients’ Global Impression of Change (PGIC):
1.The psychological general well-being index, The PGWBI is a validated Health 
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 6 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure, widely used in clinical trials and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_442347] a general evaluation of self-perceived 
psychological health and well-being. Participants are required to indicate the 
answer that best applies to them, choosing one of the 6 options (Grossi et al., 2006). 
It is composed of 22 items, rated on a 6-point scale (0 to 5). The scores for all items 
can be summarized into a summary score, which reaches a maximum of [ADDRESS_562058] achievable level of well-being.
2.Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Edition (BDI): The BDI is a self-report multiple 
choice questionnaire designed to assess depressive symptoms (Steer et al., 2001). 
Participants are required to rate their symptoms over the past two weeks from 0-3 
with increasing scores reflecting greater symptomatology. It is composed of 21 
items. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. Range of 
depression: 0–13 minimal, 14–19 mild, 20–28 moderate, and 29–63 severe.
3.The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale is a well-validated scale designed to 
assess disturbance of the apparent reality of one’s physical states, as well as, altered 
perception of bodily experience. Participants are required to indicate the Frequency 
(from 0 to 4) and the Duration (from 1 to 6) of the bodily experiences that they may 
have in their life (Sierra & Berrios, 2000). It is composed by 29 items. Each one of 
the 29 items is rated on two independent Likert scales, one for frequency and 
duration. A total score is calculated by [CONTACT_442369]. It has been 
established a score cut off of 70, >70 it is considered a depersonalization disorder.
4.Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI): The NPSI (Bouhassira et al., 
2005) assesses pain symptom severity associated with neuropathic pain. The NPSI 
is a 12 items questionnaire with a range of scores from 0 to 10 for all items, except 
for questions number 4 and 7 where the response is open. With a Total score 
maximum of 100 (summation of the 10 items except of item 4 and 7) indicating a 
clinically relevant dimension of neuropathic pain syndrome. The NPSI is also 
constituted of 5 subscales with a maximum total score of 10, indicating the specific 
dimensions of pain (burning, pressing, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain and 
paresthesia/dysesthesia). The NPSI includes severity ratings of 10 pain descriptors 
reflecting spontaneous ongoing or paroxysmal pain, evoked pain (i.e. mechanical 
and thermal allodynia/hyperalgesia) and dysesthesia/ paresthesia. In addition, the 
NPSI includes two temporal items for duration of spontaneous ongoing pain and 
paroxysmal pain. The NPSI allows discrimination and quantification of five distinct 
and clinically relevant dimensions of neuropathic pain. The NPSI has been shown 
to be both valid and reliable in heterogeneous chronic pain populations.
5. International Spi[INVESTIGATOR_174462] (ISCIPBDS ) The 
ISCIPBDS is a brief instrument that contains questions about clinically relevant 
information concerning up to three separate pain problems during the last week 
including pain interference with sleep, activities, and mood, pain intensity, and pain 
classification (Widerström-Noga et al., 2014). Respondents are asked to rate the 
interference items on a 0 to 10 scale.
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 7 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022Patients’ Global Impression of Change (PGIC): The PGIC scale was designed 
specifically to assess patients’ perception of changes following treatment (i.e., 
“feeling better” or “feeling worse”). It is a 7‐point verbal scale, with the options 
“very much improved” (3), “much improved” (2), “minimally improved” (0), “no 
change” (0), “minimally worsened” (-1) “much worsened” (-2), and “very much 
worsened” (-3). It has been demonstrated that the subjective “much improved” and 
“very much improved” ratings indicate moderately important and substantial 
improvement and the PGIC is widely used in neuropathic pain studies.
Sensory and Pain examination: All participants are required to have an AIS score. 
A trained examiner will conduct a standard neurological examination for SCI, 
including determination of the level of injury and classification on the American 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_222597] (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS):
-Quantitative sensory testing (QST) using Medoc machine (Medoc Ltd, 
Ramat Yishai, Israel and FDA approved) The sensory assessment is 
intended to detect and quantify positive and negative sensory signs 
indicative of somatosensory (dys)function. A standardized QST 
protocol is commonly used in clinical and research settings to provide 
essential information regarding an individual’s sensory status and has 
been used extensively in our research group (Widerström-Noga et al., 
2016). As part of the QST protocol, we will also assess mechanical and 
thermal allodynia. Ascending somatosensory information is transmitted 
mainly via the dorsal column-medial lemniscal (body) and the 
trigeminal lemniscus (face) for innocuous tactile and proprioceptive 
sensations, and via the spi[INVESTIGATOR_306686] (body) and the 
trigeminothalamic tract (face) for thermal and pain sensations. 
Somatosensory thresholds will be measured at two standard test sites in 
all subjects, the right cheek, near angle of nose and the thenar eminence, 
center. The right cheek will be chosen because this site is above the level 
of injury for all subjects. 
-Assessment of thermal allodynia: An allodynic response is a painful 
response evoked by a stimulus that is not normally painful. We will use 
two thermorollers [Somedic, Sweden], one set at 40°C (corresponding 
to approximately 7 degrees above normal skin temperature), and the 
other at 25°C (approximately 8 degrees below normal skin temperature). 
Moving the rollers along the skin surface enables quick location of areas 
with abnormal temperature sensibility. If the subject perceives the 
thermal sensation as pain, it will be interpreted as thermal allodynia and 
the subject will be asked to rate the sensation on an NRS.
-Assessment of dynamic and static mechanical allodynia: Dynamic 
mechanical allodynia will be investigated similarly to the method 
described by (Cruz-Almeida et al., 2012), who used a soft brush and 
lightly brushed the skin in the painful area. If pain is evoked in a test 
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 8 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022site, the participant will be asked to rate the pain intensity by [CONTACT_442370]. Static mechanical allodynia will be assessed using Semmes-
Weinstein monofilaments. Evoked pain intensity will be rated on an 
NRS.
- Pain assessments:
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): Numerical rating scales are widely 
accepted and used for the measurement of pain intensity. In this study, 
we will use this scale to assess the subjects’ ratings of pain sensation on 
a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most intense pain imaginable).
For pain history, the International SCI Pain Basic Data Set (ISCIPBDS, 
version 2.0) will be used.
Session 2-11) BI-tDCS
Participants will undergo 10 study sessions of BI and tDCS, 30 min, during 
a period of 2-4 weeks (from Monday to Friday) (Sessions 2-11). We will 
allow for up to 3 missed sessions.  
BI procedure: Two types of illusions will be used 15 min each, the rubber 
hand illusion (RHI) and the walking illusion (WI) to target upper and lower 
limbs. In the RHI a prosthetic hand will rest inside a box in front of the 
subject’s midline at the same distance in front of the subject’s chest as the 
subject’s hand is. The entire box will be covered by a mirror, which prevents 
the subject from seeing their hand. The procedure requires that participants 
will only see the rubber hand while stimulated (tactile stimulation by [CONTACT_2329] 
a paintbrush) and at the same time their hand will be also stimulated but 
hidden from their view. This will create a visual illusion as the fake hand 
will be perceived as one’s own hand. For the WI participants will sit in their 
wheelchair and a screen will be placed in front of them, composed by a half 
mirror (top part) and half projector-screen (bottom part). Participants will 
be instructed to move their upper body and observe themselves in the 
mirror, while online a video of a walking person will be projected on the 
half bottom part of the screen. This will give the illusion of walking. After 
each illusion we will ask participants questions about the strength of the 
illusion. We will use the body ownership subscale (5 items) of the 27 items 
that compose the psychometric perspective of the embodiment after bodily 
illusion by [CONTACT_442371]. in 2008 (Longo et al., 2008). The 5 items of the 
questionnaire include questions about the feeling of body ownership of the 
rubber hand and virtual legs, the response options range from -3 (completely 
disagree) to +3 (completely agree). 
tDCS : Direct current will be delivered from a battery-driven, constant 
current stimulator (TCT Research Version, Hong Kong) using saline-
soaked surface sponge electrodes (35 cm2). The anode will be placed over 
P4 (EEG 10/20 system) to target the right Posterior Parietal Cortex (rPPC), 
and the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital area. This electrode 
position is chosen because rPPC has been shown to be involved in 
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 9 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022multisensory integration, BR and localization of somatic stimuli (Azañón et 
al., 2010; De Vignemont, 2007; Makin et al., 2008; Wertheim et al., 2020). 
However, consistent with other tDCS studies on pain (Soler et al., 2010), 
where the site of stimulation is contralateral to the painful body-part, if 
participants have not bilateral pain and the painful site involves only the 
right side of the body, the anodal electrode will be placed on P3, the left 
Posterior Parietal cortex (lPPC), and be therefore contralateral to the painful 
body-part. A constant current of 2mA intensity will be applied for 30 min 
during the BI (15 min RHI plus 15 min WI). The duration of the stimulation 
has been chosen as used in previous works (Mameli et al., 2014; Ouellet et 
al., 2015).
In the sham session (inactive tDCS) there will be no stimulation. The 
procedure will be the same as the active tDCS but the machine will be 
turned off after [ADDRESS_562059] (Bikson et al., 2016; Fregni et al., 2015).
In the [LOCATION_002] tDCS is not FDA approved. Some companies have an 
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) regulation status of “investigational” 
which limits the device to investigational use and not for medical treatment 
(Fregni et al., 2015). In the European Union, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and 
Singapore, specific tDCS products have been approved for treatment of 
various neuropsychiatric disorders. (Fregni et al., 2015).
Research centers worldwide are allowed to test tDCS in controlled clinical 
trials. A list of tDCS trials can be found here: clinicaltrials.gov
POST- Session (12)
BR measures: The measure a computer task (mental rotation of body parts) will 
be performed also POST BI-tDCS (or sham) (See same procedure of PRE-Session 1 
above). This session is done in a single visit of a duration of three hours, however, if 
necessary, we will  divide the tests in 2 visits over 1 week, to meet participants’ need.

the research or applicable law requires and then destroyed by [CONTACT_442374].
7. Documents with names, social security numbers, or other sensitive 
information (e.g. informed consents, W-[ADDRESS_562061] 
forms) will be maintained separately from research data in locked cabinets 
within the controlled access offices of The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. 
These documents will be maintained and securely destroyed per UM policy.
8. A UM laptop with UM IT installed encryption may be used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_442352], however, no individually identifiable data will be located on 
this laptop.
9. Procedures for reporting theft or loss of sensitive data are in place and 
familiar to the study investigators and staff who have access to, use, or store 
data.
Data Analysis: Parametric or non –parametric statistic will be performed 
depending on data distribution.
Risks to Subjects:
Risks/discomforts associated with completion of questionnaires: Some 
questions may be emotionally distressful to some participants or make them 
uncomfortable. Participants will be instructed that they can skip any 
questions which they do not wish to answer.
Risks/discomforts associated with measurement of sensory function 
(QST): Pain thresholds will be measured for cold and hot temperatures. Each 
stimulus trial will start at a neutral temperature (32 ºC) and will be increased 
(for hot pain) until the participant indicates that the stimulus has just become 
painful. This will result in slight discomfort for the participant. As soon as the 
participant tells the experimenter that the stimulus is painful, the stimulus will 
immediately be terminated. Cut-off temperatures are in place (50 ºC for hot 
pain) so that no extreme temperatures will be presented. The cut-off value is 
well below temperatures at which any skin damage would result. The 
equipment used for sensory testing has been used in our laboratory for many 
years, without any adverse events. This equipment is also used in many other 
laboratories and has an excellent track record.
Risks/discomforts associated with BI: bodily illusions are commonly used 
research tools with no risk for participants.
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 13 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022Risks/discomforts associated with EEG measures: EEG records brain 
activity at no risk to participants. The EEG is used with the only purpose of 
recording, the electrodes are placed on the scalp attached to a custom cap with 
prepared holes. We use an EEG system with active electrodes (Biosemi Active 
Two 64 channels: https://www.biosemi.com/faq/skin_preparation.htm) and so 
high electrode impedance are tolerated, and the system can be used without the 
usual skin preparation (scrubbing) to lower impedance. This minimizes 
discomfort and eliminates risks of infection. In the case of electrodes placed 
around the face, it is possible that participants with very sensitive skin may 
experience redness, however this will be very minor and solve within minutes. 
We use a low impedance highly conductive saline gel (Signa gel by [CONTACT_442375]), 
formulated to maximize contact [CONTACT_442376], bacteriostatic, non-irritating, and non-staining.
Risks/discomforts associated with tDCS: the current applied is very weak 
(2mA) and there are not observed serious adverse effects associated with tDCS. 
Minor side effects have included (restricted to the electrode location) mild 
temporary burning or tingling at the site of stimulation, headaches and tiredness 
(Bikson et al., 2016), it is a safe procedure widely used (see (Nitsche et al., 
2003; Poreisz et al., 2007) for more information and safety aspects of tDCS 
use). It should be noted that other side-effects like nausea and dizziness can 
happen and also that they have been illustrated to occur at nearly the same rate 
as sham stimulation (fake stimulation) (Brunoni et al., 2011). These sensations 
are not painful and go away when stimulation stops. When electrodes are 
placed too close to the eye, participants may experience phosphenes that go 
away adjusting the position of electrodes. tDCS it is not a medical device and 
it is considered a non-significant-risk device, meaning that it is a technique 
without expectation of any Serious Adverse Effect (Bikson et al., 2016; 
Fregni et al., 2015). We use standard procedures, which means: no more 
than 2mA of intensity, not more than [ADDRESS_562062] 
electrodes (pads) that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_442353] 5 × 5 cm  or 5 × 7 cm (Bikson et 
al., 2016). It has been extensively used in human research and chronic pain 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_36654]., 2018).
Please note that there is no scientific evidence that suggests lasting injury or 
irreversible side-effects from tDCS, all the minor sides effects are temporary. 
We will explain participants the device and the possible minor side effects and 
we will let them familiarizing for short time by [CONTACT_2931] a very small amount 
of current before to reach 2mA. 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events associated with electrical 
stimulation: 
temporary skin redness, itching, and tingling. Other suggested but rare side-effects 
of tDCS include headache, nausea, and dizziness. These sensations go away when 
stimulation stops. 
tDCS it is not a medical device and it is considered a non-significant-risk device, meaning 
- Study #: 20200841        Effective Date: 4/11/2022
Page 14 of 27 Revised: April 1, 2022that it is a technique without expectation of any Serious Adverse Effect. 
Participants will report to study team if any of these side effects will be experienced, we 
will keep record of any reported side effect.
If the effects are experienced as uncomfortable to participants so that the stimulation will 
need to be stopped, we will not consider any data collected related to those participants. 
Participants have the right to not continue the study, in this case new participants will be 
enrolled for replacement.
8) Potential Benefits to Subjects
Participants may experience reduction in pain sensation, and will better 
understand their own pain and associated factors. 
9) Vulnerable Populations
Vulnerable populations, i.e., children, individuals with moderate to severe cognitive 
impairment, prisoners of the penal system, and women who are pregnant will not be 
considered.
10) Setting
The study will take place at The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, University 
of Miami.

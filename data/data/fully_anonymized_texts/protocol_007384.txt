1.1 Background  
1.1.1  Mesothelin  
Mesothelin was originally identified by [CONTACT_614172] a tumor associated antigen due to its 
limited expression by [CONTACT_614173]  (Chang et al., 1992 ; Chang and Pastan, 
1996) . The mesothelin gene encodes a precursor 71 -kDa protein that is processed to yield the 40 -kDa 
protein, mesothelin, which is anchored at the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linkage and an amino -terminal 31 -kDa shed fragment, called megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF). 
Both fragments contain N -glycosylation sites. A soluble splice variant of the 40 -kDa carboxyl- terminal 
fragment called “soluble mesothelin/MPF -related” has been found in the sera of patients with 
PDA (Johnston et al., 2009 ). Mesothelin is currently being explored both as a therapeutic target as well as 
a bio -marker for disease activity and therapeutic response  (Argani et al., 2001 ). 
 Mesothelin is a differentiation antigen that is also present on normal tissues. Using the mouse anti -human 
mesothelin a ntibody K1 that was developed by [CONTACT_614174], strong K1 reactivity has been 
demonstrated within mesothelial cells that line the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities, although at lower levels than usually seen for malignant tissues (Chang et al., 1992 ). Weak K1  reactivity has been 
detected within the Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_614101], tracheal basal epi[INVESTIGATOR_614102]. However, K1 reactivity has not been detected in the majority of normal tissues including the liver, kidneys, spleen, bone marrow, lymph no des, thymus, cardiac muscle, tongue, skeletal muscle, skin, cerebral cortex, 
cerebellum, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], peripheral nerve, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], adrenal, salivary gland, mammary gland, thyroid, 
parathyroid, testis, prostate, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], cervical epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], lung parenchyma, esophagus, small-bowel 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], colon epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], bladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], gall- bladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (Chang et al., 1992 ). Of note, K1 
antibody has lower affinity and it stains frozen tissues but not formalin fixed tissue, probably due to the destruction of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_614103]  (Pastan and Hassan, 2014 ). Mesothelin has also been found 
on all layers of the cornea (Jirsova et al., 2010 ). 
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_614104]  
(Chang and Pastan, 1996 ), suggesting that anti -mesothelin targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614105].   
 
Mesothelin is also expressed on a large number of lung cancers, however, in most cases, expression is 
low.  Approximately 25% of lung adenocarcinomas express mesothelin strongly on >25% of cells . 
Interestingly, this population of high mesothelin expressors is enriched in the Kras -positive patients  
(Kachala et al., 2014 ; Thomas et al., 2015 ).   
 Most serous epi[INVESTIGATOR_614106], and the related primary peritoneal carcinomas, express mesothelin  (Chang et al., 1992 ). Mesothelin is a target of a natural immune response in ovarian cancer( Ho 
et al., 2005 ), and has been pro posed to be a target for cancer immunotherapy (Hassan et al., 2004 ). The 
presence of mesothelin -specific CTLs in patients with pancreatic cancer correlates with overall survival 
(Thomas et al., 2004 ). In addition, Pastan and coworkers have used soluble antibody fragments of an anti-
mesothelin antibody conjugated to immunotoxins to t reat cancer patients with mesothelin -positive 
tumors. This approach has demonstrated adequate safety and some clinical activity in pancreatic cancer  
(Hassan et al., 2007a; Hassan et al., 2007b ). In ovarian cancer, this therapeutic strategy produced one 
minor response by [CONTACT_614175] a second patient who also had complete resolution 
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814319] of care also follows the principles applied to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_388042] (Pectasides et al., 2006 ). Weak expression of mesothelin 
was detected on this tumor type using the mouse anti -human mesothelin antibody K1 (Chang et al., 1992 ). 
Additional supportive preclinical data for targeting mesothelin has been published (Stromnes et al., 2015 ).  
1.1.[ADDRESS_814320] been chosen as the study population here because of the 
frequent expression of the target antigen mesothelin in these three types of malignancies. Each 
malignancy, including the current conventional and immunotherapeutic approaches for treating it, is 
discussed below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lung Adenocarcinoma  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality in the [LOCATION_002]. NSCLC (non -small cell 
lung cancer) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers and encompasses different  histologies 
including squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma  (Siegel et al., 2015 ). Most 
NSCLC patients present with loco -regionally advanced or metastatic disease where response rates and 
median overall survival remain dismal. Platinum -based chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for 
NSCLC in both adjuvant and metastatic disease. Over the last few years, we have made improvements in 
overall survival of patients with metastatic disease due to the a vailability of immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614107]’ individual molecular profile (Borghaei et al., 2015 ; Mok et al., 2009; 
Sandler et al., 2006 ; Topalian et al., 2012 ). Anti-PD1 antibodies have been approved in Japan and [LOCATION_003], 
based on potent activity in a variety of tumors. In 2015, pembrolizumab (anti -PD1 Keytruda  made by 
[CONTACT_44873] ) was FDA approved for non- small cell lung cancer and nivolumab ( anti-PD1 Opdivo made by [CONTACT_414]-
Myers Squibb) was approved for non- small cell lung cancer and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
Combination of checkpoint inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_368437] (fully human IgG4 anti- PD-1) with or 
without ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti- CTLA -4) for treatment of recurrent small cell lung cancer ( NCT1928394 ) has been 
shown to be tolerable and to induce durable responses ([ADDRESS_814321]). We have also 
witnessed the advent of maintenance  strategies and antiangiogenesis approaches that have improved 
patient outcomes  (Patel et al., 2009 ).  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_614108], overall survival of 
patients with metastatic NSCLC remains poor at [ADDRESS_814322] the potential for long term remission, disease control and can improve quality of life and overall survival.  
 
The Sponsor has decided to suspend enrollment of NSCLC patients into Cohort 5 as of Amendment 10. 
This decision was based on the following considerations:  
• Limited recruitment of this disease population to date; only [ADDRESS_814323] infused to date.  
• No current plans to further develop this investigational product in this disease population.  
• Logistical challenges of re -introducing pre -screening/mesothelin expression testing back into the 
study for one targeted disease population within  Cohort 5 only.

Ovarian cancer is the 5th most common cancer in women  and, in the [LOCATION_002] in 2015, 21,290 women 
were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,180 women died of the disease  (2015) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_614109], no major improvement in cure 
rates has been seen  (Huang et al., 2008 ). Surgery and platinum -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614110]. Thus, new approaches to ovarian cancer treat ment are desired. 
As ovarian tumors have previously been shown to be immunogenic (Zhang et al., 2003 ) 
immunotherapeutic strategies, including vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, and immunomodulatory drugs, 
have recently been presented as possible methods of combating ovarian cancer (Coukos et al., 2016 ).  
 In an early cell transfer trial by [CONTACT_614176]., administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to ovarian cancer patients in the adjuvant setting (after surgical resection and subsequent cisplatin-chemotherapy) resulted in a prolonged disease -free survival and increased the 3 -year survival rate, 
supporting the notion t hat T cell transfer can actively inhibit ovarian tumor growth  (Fujita et al., 1995 ). 
Moreover, administration of TILs (alone or in combination with cisplatin -containing chemotherapy) after 
a single dose of cyclophosphamide was shown to induce objective cancer regressions in some patients 
with existent chemotherapy -naïve or recurrent ovarian cancer as well ( Chang and Pastan, 1996 ). The 
mechanism of tumor eradication appeared to be cell- mediated as suggested by  [CONTACT_614177]8+ T cell 
percentages, activation of cellular immunity and enhanced natural killer activity detected in the blood 
from treated patients  (Johnston et al., 2009 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant Mesothelioma  
Malignant m esothelioma is the most serious effect of exposure to asbestos. It is an aggressive cancer 
affecting the membrane lining of the lungs or peritoneum. There are three major types of mesothelioma depending on the organ affected: pleural mesothelioma, peritone al mesothelioma, and pericardial 
mesothelioma.  
 Peritoneal mesothelioma  is a primary malignancy of the mesothelial surface of the peritoneum and 
represents about 20% of the mesothelioma cases. It is a locally progressive tumor that encases the abdominal organs and often is diagnosed at a late stage due to nonspecific patient symptoms. While up 
front responses with cisplatin and pemetrexed only have about a 25% response rate with overall survival around one year, centers of excellence employing a multimodality approach of cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy have demonstrated 5 -year survival rates of 39 -63%. 
However, peritoneal mesothelioma remains incurable and novel therapeutic options are needed.   
 Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a primary neoplasm of the mesothelial lining of the pleu ra 
space.  MPM is usually staged using the IMIG/AJCC staging system.  At the time of diagnosis, stage II disease is most common (50%), stages I (18%) and III (28%) are less frequent, and stage IV disease is very 
infrequent (4%).  Thus, in most cases, MPM i s a diffuse but locoregional disease at the time of diagnosis. 
The tumor grows in a locally -invasive fashion, often invading thoracic structures such as chest wall, 
pericardium, myocardium, and great vessels.  Distant, blood -borne metastases occur very lat e in the 
disease  (Sterman et al., 1999 ).   
 
Traditional MPM therapy has included three modalities that have been used  individually or in 
combination: surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, to date, none of these modalities has proven curative.  Surgical resection allows the removal of gross tumor but cannot provide microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -negative margins.  Radiation is limited by [CONTACT_614178] -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814324] effective combination chemotherapy, pemetrexed 
(Alimta)/cisplatin, has yielded overall response rates of up to 40%, but with improvements in overall median survival of only 3.5 months (Vogelzang et al., 2003 ).  Because of these shortcomings, several 
clinical trials utilizing aggressive surgical approaches (i.e. extrapleural pneumonectomy) coupled with 
radiation treatment and pre - or post -operative chemotherapy have been conducted in good performance 
status pat ients.  Peri -operative morbidity from this multimodality therapy has been significant, and there 
remains a peri- operative mortality rate of 5%, even in the most experienced centers.   
 
After cisplatin/pemetrexed, there is no well- accepted second -line chemo therapy (for review, see (Ceresoli 
et al., 2009 ), but based on activity in front -line patients, most c enters use either vinorelbine or 
gemcitabine, either alone or in combination with a platinum agent if disease progression has occurred shortly after first line therapy.  There is surprisingly little data about the patient response to second -line 
therapy; however, in the best study published to date (Zucali et al., 2008 )
, the activity and toxicity of 
combination gemcitabine/vinorelbine in pemetrexed- pretreated MPM patients was assessed.  Thirty 
consecutive patients who had been pretreated with pemetrexed were given gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) 
and vinorelbine (25 mg/m2) intravenously on Days [ADDRESS_814325] patients were PS 0 
or 1 (83%).  Only three patient s had a partial response (10%); there were no complete responses.  The 
median time to progression was 2.8 months (range 0.8 - 25 months).  Progression -free survival at three 
months was 45% (95% CI, 26.4 - 64.3%).  The median survival rate was 10.9 months ( range 0.8 - 25.3 
months).  Novel therapeutic approaches are clearly needed in this disease.  
1.1.3  Adoptive immunotherapy  
Breaking tolerance to self- antigens is a major obstacle in the application of immunotherapy to solid 
malignancies. Vaccine strategies aimed at harnessing endogenous anti -tumor T cells are limited by  [CONTACT_941] T 
cell receptor (TCR) repertoire which can be deleted within the thymus as part of central tolerance or 
rendered non -functional by [CONTACT_447] -thymic mechanisms of peripheral tolerance . One approach designed to 
overcome these obstacles is a doptive immunotherapy, a term used to describe the transfer of immune 
cells for the treatment of cancer or infectious disease  (June, 2007 ). With adoptive immunotherapy, 
therapeutically effective T cells can be engineered to recognize tumor s.  
 
Penn has continued to pi[INVESTIGATOR_614111] T cells referred to as  chimeric  antigen receptor s (CAR s). The significant advancement with 
such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614112] T lymphocytes with the ability of  antibodies 
to recognize distinct surface antigens in a non- MHC restricted manner.  As a result, CARs can be used to 
redirect T cells to recognize an intact membrane protein independent of antigen processing.   
 
The in vivo persistence, expansion, and functional capacity of adoptively transferred engineered T cells is 
dependent on two discrete signals mediated by [CONTACT_614179]. The primary “activation” signal is produced by [CONTACT_614180] -peptide co mplex. The second “costimulatory” signal is 
generated by [CONTACT_614181] a costimulatory molecule on the T cell surface with its cognate ligand on the 
surface of an antigen presenting cell.  
 
We and others have observed that 4 -1BB, a T cell co -stimulatory rece ptor induced by [CONTACT_614182],  is 
critical for long -term proliferation of CD8 cells  whereas  CD28 is essential for sustain ed CD4 cell 
proliferation (Maus et al., 2002 ). Consistent with this finding, we have found that “bipartite receptors” 
comprised of TCR ζ and either CD28 or 4 -1BB signaling modules substantially improve the function and 
proliferation of T cells  in vivo . (Kalos et al. 2011 )(Porter et al. 2011 ) (Grupp et al. 2013a ) (Maude et al.

immunotherapeutics, such as CART19 administered intravenously, can persist for more than [ADDRESS_814326] experience, w e pursued a similar approach  in develop ing a CAR specific for mesothelin  
protein  (Carpenito et al., 2009 ). Here, we have used the same type of lentiviral transduction system and 
the same type of CAR  construct , comprised of a  mesothelioma specific  scFv fu sed to the [ADDRESS_814327] which is specific to 
the target protein.   
1.1.4  Lymphodepletion  
Adoptive immunotherapy strategies may be able to capi[INVESTIGATOR_560482] T cell proliferation 
(Dummer et al., 2002 ), a recent finding that naive T cells begin to proliferate and differentiate into 
memory -like T cells when total numbers of naive T cells are reduced below a certain threshold( Goldrath 
and Bevan, 1999 ; Surh and Sprent, 2000 ). Lymphodepletion eliminates regulatory T -cells and other 
competing elements of the immune system that act as “cytokine sinks”, enhancing the availability of cytokines such as IL -7 and IL -15 (Klebanoff et al., 2005 ). This hypothesis has been tested clinically in 
patients with metastatic melanoma refractory of conventional treatments  (Dudley et al., 2002 ). The 
patients received a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60  mg/kg x 2 
days) and fludarabine (25 mg/m
2 x 5 days) prior to adoptive transfer of T cells. Patients with myeloma, 
NHL, and CLL have been treated with infusions of ex -vivo co -stimulated and expanded autologous T cells 
after lymphod epleting chemotherapy, and observed improved engraftment  (Laport et al., 2003 ) (Kalos et 
al., 2011 ; Porter et al., 2011 ; Rapoport et al., 2005 ) (Porter et al., 2015 ).  
 Based on the reported data as well as the data collected from o ur recently closed study ( UPenn UPCC# 
[ZIP_CODE] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) that tested the  safety of an earlier generation mesothelin directed CART cells in a 
similar patient population  indicated that preconditioning using i ntravenous cyclophosphamide (1 .5 g/m
2) 
was safe and enhanced CART expansion in peripheral blood. Neutropenia  was observed in all subjects 
with a subset being febrile  at [ADDRESS_814328] -infusion which interfered with obtain ing the  protocol 
recommended tumor biopsy  in that timeframe .  These data informed our perspective on lymphodepletion 
in this study, and we initially propose d to lower the cyclophosphamide dose to 1  g/m2 which we believe d 
would  limit toxicity in the  target  patient populations .  
 However, preconditioning with c yclophosphamide and fludarabine in combination  (Cohort 7 only) with 
adoptively transferred lymphocytes for the treatment of neoplasia induce s modulation of several 
cytokines and homeostatic proliferation of the transferred lymphocytes, promotes homing of those lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs, and contributes to in vivo  T cel l persistence.  This provides a 
rationale for combining adoptive immunotherapy with chemotherapy. (Bracci et al., 2007 ; Moschella et 
al., 2011 ) The main goal of using both cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is to achieve lymphodepletion 
that may enhance engraftment of adoptive T cells, while minimizing complic ations from 
neutropenia/myelosuppression.  Therefore, provided the previously published  data as well as the 
preliminary data from early cohorts in this study, we hypothesize the use of cyclophosphamide and 
fludarabine in preparation for local administration will improve the engraftment of the huCART -meso cells 
without increasing the risk to subjects.  
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814329] (Katz et al., 2016 ; Tilley et al., 2014 ) due to the 
finding that trafficking of CART cells to solid tumors is limited (Moon et al., 2011 ). A recent paper published 
by [CONTACT_614183] (IP) delivery of anti- mesothelin 
redirected CAR T cells in mice is superior to systemic delivery (de Biasi et al., 2014 ). This publication was 
followed by [CONTACT_614184] a clinical trial testing the safety of anti- mesothelin redirected CAR T cells 
(iCasp9M28z T cells) with or without cyclophosphamide preconditionin g (1.5 g/m2) in patients with 
malignant pleural disease from mesothelioma, lung cancer, or breast cancer by [CONTACT_614185] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Other studies are also testing the merits of local/intratumoral route of 
administration ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], NCT 01818323)  of CAR T cells in solid tumors .  
 In addition, based on our prior experience with mesothelin -directed CAR T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we hypothesize 
that local delivery of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of huCART- meso cells (established via IV infusion 
in early cohorts on this study , 1-3x10
7 huCART -meso cells/m2) may reduce the risk to subjects by [CONTACT_614186]- tumor, on -target toxicities such as those previously discussed.  Brown et al., based 
on in silico modeling of CAR T cell delivery to peripheral organs, maintains that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_614113] T cell dose administered intravenously in solid tumor clinical trials (approximately 10
8 cells) is likely insufficient to 
promote an appreciable anti- tumor effect (Brown et al, 2019; doi: http://dx.d oi.org/10.1101/759167). 
Therefore, local administration allows for delivery of the huCART -meso cells directly to the tumor, 
minimizing their peripheral distribution, reducing the potential for off- tumor, on -target toxicity, and 
maximizing the number of CAR  T cells that extravasate into the tumor microenvironment.  Therefore, local 
administration of huCART -meso cells may increase the overall therapeutic index of this investigational 
product.  
 
Thus, we propose to test the safety and feasibility of local admi nistration , test the CART escape and 
persistence into the blood, and directly compare to the same parameters following IV administration of 
the same dose.  
 Finally, in an effort to further balance both toxicity and efficacy, the Cohort 7  will permit repeat IV 
infusions of huCART -meso cells every 21 -42 days (at the clinical discretion of the physician -investigator) 
after the initial local dose.  We hypothesize that repeat IV infusions will bolster the anti-tumor effect of persistent huCART -meso cells which may lead to improved clinical outcomes while mitigating risk of 
toxicities observed at higher IV doses.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
The investigational agent in this protocol is huCART -meso cells, which are autologous T cells transduced 
with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) composed of anti -mesothelin M5 scFv fused to 4 -1BB and TCRzeta 
signaling domains .  huCART -meso cells will be manufactured using the lentiviral transduction platform, 
the same as multiple other investigational cellular products tested  at UPENN. The same technology that 
is used to transduce CART19 cells will be used to transduce huCART -meso cells (lentiviral transduction). 
The M5 scFv with specificity for mesothelin  is newly derived from a human scFv library by [CONTACT_614187].  
The scFv  is expected to redirect specificity of the transduced T cells to mesothelin  expressing cells. The 
intracellular signaling domain of the CAR molecule is comprised of the TCR ζ  and 4-1BB signaling modules  
previously tested in clinical studies (Grupp and June, 2010 ; Hassan et al., 2010a; June et al., 2009 ; Kreitman 
et al., 2009 ; Romeo and Seed, 1991 ), both entirely of t he native human sequences. The CAR  receptors are 
“universal” in that they bind antig en in an MHC -independent fashion, thus, one receptor construct can be 
used to treat a population of patients with mesothelin antigen -positive tumors.

1.6 Trial Rationale  
Immunotherapy is a novel and promising approach for the treatment of solid tumors; immunotherapy with CART cells in particular has the potential advantage  of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614114] a rapid 
tumor response, and the advantage of long- lived responses that are the hallmark of engagement of the 
adaptive immune system such as memory T cells.  
 This Phase I study poses the hypothesis that targeting the mesothelin antigen that is widely and frequently expressed in multiple tumor types, particularly epi[INVESTIGATOR_614115], 
feasible, and result in anti- tumor responses. Furthermore, this study addresses the question s of wheth er 
a human construct persists better in vivo  than a murine based CAR construct, whether lymphodepletion 
is necessary for engraftment and persistence of huCART -meso directed T cells in patients with solid 
tumors , and whether intrapleural ( IP) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration has benefits compared to 
IV administration .  
 As of Protocol Amendment V5, the maximum tolerated dose has been established as 1 -3x10
7 huCART -
meso cells /m2. While the safety of this dose level has been established u sing IV administration, there was 
a lack of clear clinical efficacy at this dose level in Cohorts [ADDRESS_814330] seen both safety and increased 
efficacy of multiple CAR T cell doses.  Therefore , we plan to explore the safety and feasibility of 
administering up to three (3) infusion s of huCART -meso cells at the MTD  (given a minimum of 21 days 
apart) in Cohort 6  (intravenous  administration ) and Cohort 7 (intraperitoneal administration  on Day 0 , 
followed by [CONTACT_614188]) .  As a secondary objective, we will also evaluate the anti- tumor 
response of this regimen.     
1.7 Potential Risks and Benefits  
This protocol is designed to determin e the safety and feasibility of both intravenous administration and 
local delivery of permanently modified C AR T cells that target mesothelin , with or without 
lymphodepletion .

It is anticipated that subjects with pleural effusion will already have a catheter in place.  However, in the 
event a catheter must be placed for IP administration, the risks associated with this include infection, bleeding, local pain at insertion site, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and post drainage pain.  There is also a risk associated with the moderate sedation used at the time of catheter placement which includes over sedation, nausea, vomiting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], irregular heart rhythm, and low blood 
pressure.   The subject will be closely monitored by a licensed provider per institutional standard practice.  The timing of placement and subsequent removal of the catheter will be per clinical discretion.  
 The risks associated with pleural instillation are the same as those associated with IV administration.  
However, there is also a higher risk of pleuritis given the direct administration into the pleural cavity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  I ntraperitoneal Access and Administration of CAR T cell s (Cohort 7)    
Some subjects may already have a catheter in place; however, in the event a catheter must be placed for Intraperitoneal (i.p.) Instillation, placement of the catheter will be performed by [CONTACT_134208] (IR) or other appropriately licensed provider.  Location (IR or bedside) of the paracentesis procedure will 
depend on the ascites volume (moderate/large amount of ascites, i.e. a t least  3 cm pocket  is required for 
bedside placement ).  The timing of placement and subsequent removal of the catheter will be per clinical 
discretion.  
 
Percutaneous techniques will be utilized in this protocol. Percutaneous insertion with radiologic guidance has the advantage of minimally invasive and correct catheter positioning in the lower abdomen. Safely accessing the intra-abdominal space for an individual patient may or may not require administration of a small volume of saline or contrast.  
 
Risks associated with the procedure include, but are not limited to, pain or discomfort at the needle insertion site, bleeding at the site, internal bleeding, injury to a blood vessel, organ puncture, and infection which may result in an infection of the blood stream. The development of any infection may result in the 
need for intr avenous antibiotics. X -ray contrast material may be used at the time of catheter insertion. 
Risks associated with the X -ray contrast material include an allergic reaction.  
 
Moderate sedation may be used during the catheter placement. Risks of the medicati ons used for the 
moderate sedation include aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (inhaling food or liquid into the lungs), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], over -
sedation, nausea, vomiting, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], irregular heart rhythm, and low blood pressure. In 
addition to the potential risks associated with the procedure, the X -ray contrast material, and the 
moderate sedation, there may be other unpredictable risks including death.  
 
Subjects will be asked to sign a standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614116]. The subject will be 
closely monitored during/after the procedure by a licensed provider per institutional standard practice.  
 
The risk of peritoneal inflammation with IP administration is anticipated to be higher than that of IV 
administration given the direct administration into the peritoneal cavity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  C yclophosphamide   
In over 10% patients, cyclophosphamide has dermatologic reactions (alopecia beginning 3 -6 weeks) and 
may cause sterility; thrombocytopenia and anemia are less common than leukopenia and neutropenia 
with an onset at 7 days, nadir at 10 -14 days, and recovery at 21 days. Nausea and vomiting occur more

antiemetic prophylaxis and therapy. Acute hemorrhagic cystitis, believed to be a result of chemical 
irritation of the bladder by [CONTACT_145190], a cyclophosphamide metabolite, occurs in 7% to 12% of patients and has been reported in up to 40% of patien ts in some series. Patients will be encouraged to drink plenty of 
fluids during and after therapy (most adults will require at least 2 L/day), and void frequently. With large IV doses, IV hydration is usually recommended. The use of mesna and/or continuous  bladder irrigation is 
rarely needed for doses <2 g/m
2.  Less frequent reactions (1 -10%) such as facial flushing, headache, and 
skin rush may occur. Nasal congestion occurs when IV doses are administered too rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (large doses via 
30-60 minute infusion);  patients experience runny eyes, rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, and sneezing during 
or immediately after the infusion. If needed, a decongestant or decongestant/antihistamine (e.g., pseudoephedrine or pseudoephedrine/triprolidine) can be used to prevent or relieve these symptoms.  
 The above describes the risks of cyclophosphamide when given as part of routine care.  We expect similar side effects when administered as part of this study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  F ludarabine    
Fludarabine may induce myelosuppression, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
lymphopenia.  Severe, often reversible, myelosuppression may occur, although this typi[INVESTIGATOR_614117] (administered for 3 consecutive days every 28 days).  In this 
study, patients will receive one 3 -day administration of fludarabine.  Autoimmune hematologic 
phenomena, including hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia may occur following 1 or more cycles of fludarabine.  Patients undergoing treatment with fludarabine will be evaluated and monitored closely for cytopenias and/or hemolysis.  Nausea and vomiting may occur with fludarabine, and subjects 
will be offered antiemetic prophylaxis and therapy.   
 The above describes the risks of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine when given as part of routine care.  
We expect similar side effects when administered as part of this study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  F ludarabine i n Combination with Cyclophosphamide  
• Common : Lowered neutrophils/granulocytes that may lead to infection. Lowered platelets may

infection of the skin.  
• Less Likely : Allergic reaction, severe allergic reaction that causes fever, aches and pains in the 
joints, skin rash, and swollen lymph glands, stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, abnormal

throat which can be severe, hives, diarrhea, high blood sugar, low blood potassium, dizziness, 
convulsion or seizure, abdominal pain, pain such as back, joint, and/or muscle pain, headache, 
wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, inflammation of the lung which may cause difficulty 
breathing and difficulty getting oxygen, infertility or sterility, or irregular menstrual periods. Some 
women may not resume their periods , SIADH  (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) ,

dysfunction resulting in the ability to breathe which can be life -threatening, allergic reactions to 
blood transfusions, Tumor Lysis Syndrome - a rapid decline in the number of tumor cells that can 
lead to kidney failure and/or chemical imbalances that may have a serious effect on other organs 
such as hea rt. If this were to occur, subjects will receive close monitoring and blood tests, as well 
as appropriate medical treatment. It is possible that secondary malignancies including 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may also be ex perienced.

(false -positive) resulting in huCART -meso infusion in a patient with no mesothelin expression on his/her 
tumor is the same as the risks listed above, with the exception of TLS and CRS which are not expected due to the lack of tumor antigen expression.   
 Mesothelin IHC testing was subsequently  eliminated as an eligibility parameter with Protocol Amendment 
V9.  Eliminating IHC testing as an enrollment activity is based on the heterogeneity of mesothelin 
expression on accessible tumors , and the  limited, and likely non -representative,  amount  of tissue being 
analyzed by [CONTACT_4658] . This heterogeneity may bias diagnostic conclusions based on mesothelin -negative IHC 
results , since  other areas of the tumor  may in fact express  mesothelin  at study -qualifying levels . 
Therefore, IHC analysis is being removed in favor of the more sensitive, specific, and reliable GeoMx Digital 
Spatial Profiling analysis for both the presence of mesothelin on tumor tissue as well as CAR T cell localization to tumor. Furthermore, since a primary objective of the study is to evaluat e the safety  of 
huCART -meso cells , removing I HC testing neither  impact s the safety endpoint nor adds additional risk  to 
subjects. However, by [CONTACT_614189], it is anticipated to  improve subject 
eligibility. Finally, the risk mitigation strategies employed on the study (e.g.: eliminating the first pass of huCART -meso cells through the lungs by [CONTACT_614190], inpatient monitoring post -infusion, 
an acute awareness of complications based on prior experience, etc.) are designed to mitigate on -target, 
off-tumor adverse reactions such as ARDS.  
1.7.3  Research Procedures  
Additional risks for the participating subjects are related to procedures  including the following:   
Potential risks of the apheresis procedure include nausea, vomiting, fainting or dizziness, seizures, skin  
rash, hives, flushing, blood loss, and infection. Tingling of the lips, muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_6926], very rarely, changes in heart rhythm can occur. These can be prevented or made milder by [CONTACT_238093], either by [CONTACT_238090], also called i ntravenous (IV).  
 Very rarely, (less than 1 in 1,000 procedures), clotting may occur in the apheresis machine or in a patient and is potentially life -threatening. To reduce the risk of clotting, a drug called ACD (acid -citrate -dextrose) 
will be used. This drug may increase the risk of bleeding and may cause temporary tingling of the lips and limbs, muscle crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], seizures, or changes in the heart rhythm.  
 After the apheresis procedure the patient may experience temporary discomfort, including irritation, 
swelling or bruis ing at the place where the needle was inserted into the vein to collect the blood. 
Apheresis can also occasionally cause hives, numbness and tingling, or swelling of the feet and ankles.

pain, discomfort, soreness, bleeding, and bruising.   
 Given that the patient populations recruited for this protocol have limited therapeutic options, we believe 
that the above risks are acceptable.   
1.7.[ADDRESS_814332]; in two preliminary studies 
(UPCC#[ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE]) performed at UP ENN testing RNA CART -meso cells , [ADDRESS_814333] been shown to exert sustained clinical responses (Brentjens et al., 2013 ; 
Garfall et al., 2015 ; Grupp et al., 2013b; Kalos et al., 2011 ; Maude et al., 2014 ; Porter et al., 2011 ), 
(Brentjens et al., 2013 ). Additionally, safety and efficacy of CAR T cells redirected against BCMA are tested 
in patients with multiple myeloma at UPENN and the preliminary results indicate that this cellular therapy 
is tolerable and induce durable responses (unpublished data).  
1.8 Justification of Route and Dose R egimen  
Route of Administration (ROA) .  
• Intravenous : Autologous huCART -meso cells will be administered intravenously (IV)  as a single 
dose infusion. This route of administration is the most likely to result in distribution of huCART -
meso to all sites of tumor. Intrave nous infusion is being evaluated in Cohorts 1 -4 and 6. Cohorts 
3 and 4 were permanently closed with Protocol V5  due to toxicity .  
• Intrapleural (IP): Cohort 5  will evaluate autologous huCART -meso cells administered intrapleurally 
(IP) in patients with  malignant effusions in the pleural space (i.e. MPM, and ovarian cancer with 
cytologically confirmed malignant pleural effusion) , where  the tumor is uniquely accessible  and 
directed administration of therapeutic agents , such as CART cells, is possible. The method of IP 
instillation  for targeted therapeutic deliv ery has been employed previously at the University of 
Pennsylvania  in patients with malignant mesothelioma  (Sterman et al., 2016 ; Sterman et al., 2005 ; 
Sterman et al., 1998 ) and elsewhere in ovarian cancer patients  (Hase nburg et al., 2001 ). In these 
studies, no toxicities were associated directly with the IP route of administration.  
Note: As of protocol Amendment 10, recruitment of NSCLC patients into Cohort [ADDRESS_814334] in this disease population.  
• Intrape ritoneal (i.p.): Cohort [ADDRESS_814335].

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] . o The method of localized instillation for targeted therapeutic delivery has been employed 
previously at the University of Pennsylvania in patients with malignant mesothelioma 
who had pleural administration of agent (Sterman et al., 2016 ; Sterman et al., 2005 ; 
Sterman et al., 1998 ) and elsewhere in ovarian cancer patients (Hasenburg et al., 2001 ). 
In one patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis and no 
other treatment options available, anti- mesothelin CAR T cells were safely delivered by 
[CONTACT_614191] a compassionate -use basis at UPenn with the 
expectation that delivery of T cells via an i.p. route of administration may provide signi ficant clinical benefit (UPCC#[ZIP_CODE]; IRB#814373).   
• Repeat IV Administration (Cohorts 6 and 7) : In an effort to further balance both toxicity and 
efficacy, repeat administration of huCART -meso cells will be performed via IV infusion after the 
initial dose (approximately every 21 -42 days, as per the physician -investigator’s clinical 
discretion).  We hypothesize that additional IV infusions may maintain the therapeutic index of 
previously administered cells in the tumor microenvironment, which may have become  exhausted 
or hypofunctional. There is strong pre -clinical data supporting this hypothesis in a mouse model 
of pancreatic cancer (Stromnes et al., 2015 ), and we anticipate that repeat infusions may bolster 
the anti -tumor potential of huCART -meso cells in this setting.   
 
Dose  Rationale  for huCART -meso Product .  The decision for a starting dose for biologics is guided based 
on 1) FDA Guidance for Industry: S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology -derived 
Pharmaceuticals; 2) Joint taskforce report from the BioIndustry Association (BIA) and the Association of 
the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) ; 3) the available literature on phase I trials to date conducted 
with CAR T cells, and 4) accumulating experience on phase I trials targeting mesothelin using the CAR technology.  
 
For biologics, the goal is to start at or below the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL)  and 
the conventional dose escalation for cell based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614118]10 increments. Since toxicity usually arises from exaggerated pharmacological effects with biologics, sometimes combined with a narrow therapeutic range and/or a steep dose -response relationship from the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) to toxicity, the pharmacologically active dose is often a more sensitive indicator of potential toxicity for biotechnology -derived pharmaceuticals. There are various ways of estimating MABEL. One 
way is to model the occupancy of the target with different doses; another is to test effects on human tissues ex vivo (readily applied if the target is carried  by [CONTACT_614192]); t he 
third is to use data from a carefully qualified animal model. Finally, a literature review of the effects of other relevant molecules is important.  
 
In an in vivo  study using the NOD/SCID/γc -/- mouse tumo r xenograft performed by [CONTACT_614193] a similar CAR of different specificity, the pharmacologically effective dose (PED) of the CAR T cells was 1x10
7 CAR T cells/mouse. At this dose, some of the mice develop ed xenogeneic graft versus host 
disease. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the mouse model was 50x107cells/mouse.  The NOAEL 
was ~1x106 CAR T cells per mouse. The NOD/SCID/ γc-/- is the best available model for evaluating 
preclinical efficacy of CAR T cells  for mesothelin -expressing tumors; however, the mouse tumor xenograft 
model is a non -relevant species for determination of some aspects of toxicology for this particular CAR T 
cell, because the anti -mesothelin scFv SS1 component does not bind to normal mou se mesothelial tissue, 
and therefore, the mouse will under -predict  toxicity. However, the lack of an immune response to the 
CAR T cells in the mouse tumor model will tend to over -predict  other effects, because humans will make 
responses that limit the pers istence of vector - modified T cells (Kershaw et al., 2006 ; Lamers et al., 2006 ).

might be safe.  
 
In the  clinical studies of meso RNA CAR T cells o pened  at UP ENN, flat doses of 108 and 109 total 
cells/infusion for multiple infusions have been administered to 14 subjects with either pleural 
mesothelioma or pancreatic cancer  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). In all cases, the efficacy of 
electroporation and CAR expression was over 85% cells on a flow based assay.  In several cases, mild 
cytokine release syndromes have been observed upon multiple exposures to the higher dose T cell 
product. One subject developed an anaphylactic reaction after the 3rd infusion due to development of 
HAMA; however, [ADDRESS_814337] has been reported  suggesting that doses up to 109 cells are safe.   
 
The follow 
up study at UPENN has been the one testing the safety of lentivirally transduced autologous T 
cells targeting mesothelin (CART -meso cells) using the same CAR construct as the RNA based studies, 
namely one using the mouse SS1 derived scFv ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Our group treated 15  subjects 
(mesothelioma, serous ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer) with one infusion of either 3x107 or 3x108 
CART -meso cells/m2 with or without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The safety profile of this study has 
been favorable. The majority of the related AEs are Grades 1 -2 (79.5%).  The m
ajority of Grade 3-4 related 
AEs w
ere for one pancreatic cancer patient (20 of 24, 83.3%) and they met the DLT criteria . The study was 
completed with infusion of [ADDRESS_814338] been tested at up to 5x1010 cells  (Kershaw et al., 2006 ). 
However, c onsidering all the information presented herein, w e have chosen to start our study with a low 
dose of 1-3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2 per subject , with an acceptable dose range to allow for small 
variations in manufacturing and transduction.   As part of this study, [ADDRESS_814339] been safely treated 
at dose level of 1- 3x107 huCART -meso cells/m2 with and without lymphodepleting chemotherapy ([ADDRESS_814340] s in Cohort 1 ; 3 subjects in Cohort 2) and no DLTs were identified.  However, when the dose was 
escalated to 1 -3x108 huCART -meso cells/m2 (Cohort 3) , unacceptable toxicity was experienced, thus 1 -
3x107 huCART -meso cells/m2 was established as the MTD.  This dose level will be further explored using  
local delivery methods  as well as through additional IV infusions (given  approximately  21-42 days apart).   
 The minimum acceptable dose for infusion will continue to be  1x10
6 huCART -meso  cells /m2.

[ADDRESS_814341] been permanently modified to be 
directed to mesothelin protein with an anti -mesothelin CAR fused to the signaling domains of 4 -1BB and 
TCRζ. The study population  includes patients with mesothelin -expressing cancers.  
 
The original protocol included a 3+3 dose escalation design.  However, as of protocol amendment 5, the 
maximum tolerated dose has been established ( 1-3x107 huCART -meso  cells /m2) and Cohorts [ADDRESS_814342], the MTD will be further 
evaluated utilizing different routes of administration, including local delivery methods  (intrapleural and 
intraperitoneal) as well as repeat administration  via IV infusion.  
 Once subjects  are determined to be eligible and the monitoring visit for eligibility is completed , subjects  
will be scheduled for apheresis and huCART -meso cell manufacturing. If patients have an apheresis 
product collected prior to enrollment into this study, this apheresis product may be used for CAR  T cell 
manufacturing.  In this instance, the subject will not need to undergo another apheresis, and CAR  T 
manufacturing may be initiated immediately after the monitoring visit for elig ibility has been completed.   
 All subjects will be assigned a cohort for the interventional portion of the protocol (see below).  Subjects 
will be followed for safety and research assessments as detailed in the Schedule of Events ( Appendices 1 -
3).   
 Adverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event reporting period outlined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_814343] progresses and/or initiates another therapy, the 
subject will be encouraged to enroll in the  separate  long -term follow -up study that is requested of all 
subjects w ho have received therapy with cells that have been gene- modified with an integrating vector, 
such as huCART -meso cells.

This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of both intravenous administration and local 
delivery of lentiviral transduced huCART -meso cells with and without lymphodepleting chemotherapy . 
 
Dose Escalation Cohorts:  
• Cohort 1 (N  = 3- 6): will receive a single dose of 1 -3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2 on day 0 without 
any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.   
• Cohort 2 (N  = 3- 6): will receive a single dose of 1 -3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2 on day 0, following 
a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2 -4 days prior to huCART -meso cells 
(day -4 to day -2).   
• Cohort 3 subjects (N=3 -6): will receive a single dose of 1 -3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART -
meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen .  Cohort 3 permanently 
closed with Protocol V5.  
• Cohort 4 subjects (N=3 -6) will receive a single dose of  1-3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART -
meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2 -4 
days prior to huCART -meso cells (day -4 to day -2). Cohort 4 permanently closed with Protocol 
V5.  
 
Historical Cohort Advancement Plan : 
Subjects will be enrolled serially. Infusions will be staggered t o allow assessment of DLTs for cohort 
progression, expansion, or dose  de-escalation. For example, the 2nd and 3rd subjects in each cohort may 
be infused and followed in parallel but only after the 1st subject in that cohort completes the day [ADDRESS_814344] would be dosed 
at the same regimen/cohort. If there is [ADDRESS_814345] and 2nd subjects, further enrollment in that 
cohort will be discontinued, and additional subjects will be enr olled into a dose de -escalation cohort.  
 
The clinical PI [INVESTIGATOR_614119] (where applicable).  Please refer to Section 5.4 for the definition of dose -
limiting toxicity as well as additional information on cohort progression.   
 
The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0- 1 DLT occurs in 6 evaluab le subjects 
tested within the dose range of this study.  As of protocol amendment V5, the maximum tolerated dose has been established as 1 -3x10
7 huCART -meso cells/m2. 
 Subsequent enrollment will occur in the dose expansion cohorts (Cohorts 5 -7) at the MTD only.  
Enrollment in these cohorts may occur in parallel and will include up to 6 subjects/cohort.  All subjects 
will be continually evaluated for dose -limiting toxicit ies (DLT).  In the event of 2 DLTs in a specific cohort, 
additional enrollment and treatment activity within that cohort will be paused to allow for further investigation.

and will not be considered for DLT evaluations  and cohort advancement decisions, and they will be 
replaced in that cohort.  However, these subjects wil l still be followed for overall safety and included in 
the analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints in accordance with  the Schedule of Events  
(Appendices 1 -3).  
[ADDRESS_814362] been engineered to  express an extracellular single 
chain variable fragment (scFv) with mesothelin specificity. The T cells express an intracellular signaling 
molecule comprised of the TCR  ζ chain, and 4 -1BB. The huCART -meso  cells are cryopreserved in infusible 
cryomedia ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Each bag will contain a dose of CART positive cells corresponding to their 
assigned dose level as per cohort assignment. The total cell dose is dependent on the transduction 
efficiency; the volume of cells is dependent on the total cell dose with a minimum  of 10 mL per bag . The 
minimum acceptable dose for infusion is 1x106 huCART -meso  cells /m2. 
5.1.2  Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®) is considered investigational therapy for subjects participating in targeted 
Cohorts (Section 6.4 ). Cyclophosphamide is an alk ylating agent with antineoplastic activity. The main goal 
of using cyclophosphamide is to achieve lymphodepletion that may enhance engraftment of adoptive T 
cells, while minimizing complications from neu tropenia.  
 
Cohorts 2 and 6:  
Cyclophosphamide will be administered as a flat dose of 1 gram /m2 2-[ADDRESS_814363] huCART -meso infusion. 
The proposed regimen has been used widely in other studies and has been t olerated well. The ultimate 
criterion by [CONTACT_614201] T cell engraftment is the 
lymphocyte count 1 -3 weeks after adoptive transfer.  
 
Cohort 7:  
Cyclophosphamide will be administered as 300 mg/m2/day over [ADDRESS_814364] day of 
chemotherapy falls 3 days (±1 day) prior to the first huCART -meso  infusion (Day 0). The proposed regimen 
has been used widely in other studies and has been tolerated well.

Fludarabine is considered  investigational therapy for subjects participating in Cohort 7  only . Fludarabine 
is a purine analog that inhibits DNA synthesis through interference with DNA polymerase and 
ribonucleotide reductase enzymes. Fludarabine is widely used in the treatment of l ymphocytic 
hematologic malignancies and possesses potent immunosuppressive activity. It is excreted principally in the urine as an active metabolite. The main goal of using fludarabine (in combination with cyclophosphamide) is to achieve lymphodepletion th at may enhance engraftment of adoptive T cells, 
while minimizing complications from myelosuppression.  
 
Cohort 7:  
Fludarabine will be administered as 30 mg/m2/day over [ADDRESS_814365] day of chemotherapy falls 
3 days (±1 day) prior to the first huC ART-meso infusion (Day 0). The proposed regimen has been used 
widely in other studies and has been tolerated well.  Fludarabine doses will be rounded down to the 
nearest 50 mg vial size, if the rounded dose does not differ by > 10% of the original dose pres cribed.  
 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
The treatment regimen received will be dependent on cohort assignment as follows:  
• Cohort 1 (N  = 3- 6): will receive a single dose of 1 -3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2 on day 0 without 
any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.   
• Cohort 2 (N  = 3- 6): will receive a single dose of 1 -3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2 on day 0, following 
a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2 -4 days prior to huCART -meso cells 
(day -4 to day -2).   
• Cohort 3 subjects (N=3 -6) will receive a single dose of 1 -3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART -
meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.   Cohort 3 permanently 
closed with Protocol V5.  
• Cohort 4 subjects (N=3 -6) will receive a single dose of  1-3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced huCART -
meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2 -4 
days prior to huCART -meso cells (day -4 to day -2). Cohort 4 permanently closed with Protocol 
V5.  
• Cohort 5 (N  = up to 6) : will receive a single dose of 1 -3x107 huCART -meso  cells /m2 on day 0 by 
[CONTACT_614194] (IP) through an indwelling pleural catheter without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen. The safety of this dose level has been established by [CONTACT_85973] 1 and 
2.  
• Cohort  6 (N = up to 6) : will receive a dose of 1 -3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2 via IV infusion on Day

[IP_ADDRESS]  Manufacturing of huCART -meso  
huCART -meso cell  product manufacturing will be performed by [CONTACT_614202] 
(CVPF) at the University of Pennsylvania, using the patients’ apheresis product.  The weight obtained prior 
to the apheresis procedure  will be used for dosing and will not be modified as a result of changes in the 
subject ’s weight.   
  Each huCART -meso cell dose will be cryopreserved  in infusion bag(s) containing cryomedia.  The volume 
of each dose will be dependent on the total cell number and transduction efficiency.  The minimum 
volume will be 10mL per infusion bag.   The cells will be stored in the CVPF until ready for product 
release/administration  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Release and Preparation of huCART -meso  
When ready for administration, the huCART -meso cell product will be dispensed to the clinical team for 
administration per CVPF standard operating procedures and in acco rdance with the Investigational 
Product Handling Manual.

two individuals will independently verify that the product is correctly matched to the subject.  
 
Receipt of huCART -meso Cells/ Cell Thawing   
The cryopreserved huCART -meso cells will be transported in dry ice to the subject’s bedside. The cells will 
be thawed at the bedside using a water bath maintained between 36°C to 38°C. There should be no frozen 
clumps left in the container at the time of infusion. If the CAR T cell product appears to have a damaged or leaking bag, or otherwise appears to be compromised, it should not be infused and should be returned 
to the CVPF as specified below.  
Return or Destruction of Investigational Product  
huCART -meso cells may need to be returned to the CVPF for a variety of reasons, including but not limited 
to: 1) Mislabeled product; 2) Condition of patient prohibits infusion/injection, and 3) Subject refuses infusion. Any unused product will be returned to CVPF.  Final disposition of the investigational product is 
to be doc umented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Administration of huCART -meso  
Subjects in Cohorts [ADDRESS_814371] meet in order to 
proceed with huCART -meso infusion.  
 
Side effects following T cell infusions may include transient fever, chills, rigors, myalgias/arthralgias, 
headache, fatigue, and/or nausea. Subjects  will be pre -medicated with acetaminophen [ADDRESS_814372] fev er not relieved by [CONTACT_58086]. It is recommended that 
subjects do not  receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone (Solu -
Medrol) , or dexamethasone (Decadron) . If corticosteroids are required for an acute infusional reaction, 
an in itial dose of hydrocortisone [ADDRESS_814373] while cold, within 30 minutes after they are thawed. There 
should be no frozen clumps left in the bag prior to infusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  For huCART- meso cell IV administration  
T cell infusions will be performed by a licensed Registered Nurse at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133199]. The transduced T cells will be infused at a rate of 10-20 ml/minute into an intravenous 
catheter, either through a peripheral vein (preferred) or central vein.  A macrodrip intravenous tubing will be used to infuse the CART ce lls by [CONTACT_20138] (i.e. no infusion pump).  The macrodrip intravenous tubing will 
be connected to a “Y” adapter with one end of the adapter spi[INVESTIGATOR_614125] a normal saline solution bag.  A leukoreduction filter  must not be used for the infusion of the T

administration. The timing of placement and subsequent removal of the intra- pleural  catheter will be per 
clinical discretion.   Pleu ral fluid may be collected for research purposes at the time of catheter placement.  
 
Prior to huCART -meso cell administration, the pleural cavity will be maximally drained. After drainage is 
complete, the transduced T cells will be instilled through the intrapleural catheter into the affected pleural 
space. The c ells are infused by [CONTACT_614203] a rate of 10 -20 ml/minute . After huCART -meso cell infusion is 
complete, the tube is flushed with 20ml of sterile saline and clamped. The end of the tube is swabbed 
with alcohol swabs, a new valve cap is placed and the site is re -dressed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  huCART -meso intraperitoneal (i.p.) instillation:  
Some subjects may already have a catheter in place; however, in the event a catheter must be placed for Intraperitoneal (i. p.) Instillation, placement of the catheter will be performed by [CONTACT_134208] 
(IR) or other appropriately licensed provider. The subject will have an intraperitoneal catheter placed by [CONTACT_614204][INVESTIGATOR_8829], prior to their first planned 
huCART -meso infusion.  Ideally, the catheter will be placed on the day of the i.p. infusion.  Location (IR or 
bedside) of the paracentesis procedure will depend on the ascites volume (m oderate/large amount of 
ascites, i.e. a 3 cm pocket , is required for bedside placement ).  If ascites is present at the time of catheter 
placement, the peritoneal cavity will be maximally drained (if clinically appropriate). Following catheter placement and  appropriate routine care monitoring, the subject will be transported back to the inpatient 
floor for continued care and receipt of huCART -meso cells.  
 
The T cell infusion will be performed by a licensed provider at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614126].  The transduced T cells will be instilled through the indwelling peritoneal catheter into the 
affected peritoneal space at an infusion rate of 10 -20 mL/min.  
 
Following the infusion, the subject should lie in the lateral decubitus position on the opposite side of the 
catheter for [ADDRESS_814375] discharge per clinical discretion.   Timing of placement and subsequent removal of the intraperitoneal 
catheter will be per clinical dis cretion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Safety Monitoring  
Emergency medical equipment (i.e. a crash cart) must be available for an emergency situation during the infusion in the event that the subject has an allergic response, or severe hypotensive crisis, or any other 
reacti on to the infusion.    
 
Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate , blood pressure, and oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_3347]) will be measured within 10 minutes prior and within 15 minutes after the infusion.   Thereafter, 
vital signs will be measured at 30 (+/ - 5) minutes, 45 (+/ - 5) minutes, and 60 (+/ - 5) minutes after the 
infusion, and then every hour (+/ - 10 minutes)  for the next two hours until these signs are satisfactory

[IP_ADDRESS]  Fludarabine Toxicity Management Considerations  
Potential risks of fludarabine administration and their management are described in Section 1.7  and 6.4.   
5.4 Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  and Cohort Progression  
Dose limiting toxicity is defined as either hematologic or non -hematologic toxicity (NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4.03) which develops following dosing, is new (not a pre-
existing condition ongoing at the time of infusion, regardless of grading ), at least possibly related to T 
cells , and non- manageable to Grade 1 -2 within 7 days of onset .  The duration of the DLT monitoring period 
will be dependent on cohort assignment as follows:  
• Cohorts 1 -5: Through the Day 28 safety follow -up visit.  
• Cohorts 6 -7: Through the Day 21 safety follow -up visit.  
 The following events will be considered DLTs if determined to be related to huCART -meso cell therapy   
and the event meets all other criteria in the above definition :  
• Grade 3 or higher non -hematological toxicity except; with the following exceptions:  
o Grade 3  electrolyte  abnormalitie s 
o Nausea  
o Vomiting  
o Diarrhea  
o Fatigue   
• Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity ; except those expected following lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy administration ( e.g. thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia , anemia, etc ).  
 
Historical Cohort Advancement Plan:  
Subjects will be enrolled serially. Infusions will be staggered t o allow assessment of DLTs for cohort 
progression, expansion, or dose de -escalation. For example, the 2nd and 3rd subjects in each cohort may 
be infused and followed in parallel but only after the 1st subject  in that cohort completes the day [ADDRESS_814380] would be  dosed at the 
same regimen/cohort . If there is [ADDRESS_814381] and 2nd subjects, further enrollment in that cohort will 
be discontinued, and additional subjects will be enrolled into the dose de -escalation cohort. The study

toxicity, and the maximum tolerated dose has been establis hed as 1 -3x107 huCART -meso cells /m2.   
 Subsequent enrollment will occur in the dose expansion cohorts (Cohorts 5 -7) at the MTD  only .  
Enrollment in these cohorts may occur in parallel and will include up to 6 subjects/cohort.  All subjects 
will be continually evaluated for dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) .  In the event of [ADDRESS_814383]’s participation .  Subjects may also continue to receive 
standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or undergo routine care procedures for the management of their disease prior to receipt of study treatment and while their product is being manufactured. However, t he following 
guidelines must be adhered to during the study : 
• Apheresis:  
o Steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be used within 5 days prior to the apheresis procedure. Patients may be on a stable low dose of steroids (≤10mg daily equivalent of prednisone).  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_614127].  
o Concurrent cancer treatment is not allowed within 1 week prior to the apheresis procedure.  Medication intended solely for supportive care (e.g. analgesics, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, antidepressants or bisphosphonates, etc.) may be used at the investigator’s discretion. Palliative focal radiation therapy for symptom management is allowed. 
o Subjects must not have received a n investigational product within 2 weeks prior to  
apheresis collection.

infusion safety check , 4) an intervention phase consisting of huCART-meso  cell administration alone or 
following study -mandated chemotherapy , and 5) safety  follow -up visits.  The Schedule of Events is 
included in Appendices [ADDRESS_814384] can undergo any research -related procedures.  
Results obtained in routine clinical care prior to informed consent may also be used for screening purposes 
as long as they are obtained within the protocol required windows.   
 Screening procedures include:  
• Complete medical history  
• Physical examination including vital signs, height , and weight  
• Review of concomitant medications  and prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including timing of previous checkpoint 
inhibitors if given)  
• ECOG performance status  
• Leukapheresis screening  - Subjects can be given the opportunity to undergo temporary central 
venous access for apheresis if peripheral access cannot  be obtained.

• 12 lead Electrocardiogram (E KG) 
• Resting echocardiogram  (ECHO)  
• Urine β HCG pregnancy (women of childbearing potential)  
• MRI Brain  - For suspected brain metastasis (performed within 8 weeks of eligibility confirmation 
by a physician -investigator ) 
• Tumor assessments with computed tomography  performed with or without contrast within 8 
weeks of eligibility confirmation by a physician -investigator .  The types of scans performed will be 
per clinical discretion based on the patient population and disease status.   
 In the event that the time between the screening visit and the infusion of huCART -meso cells exceeds the 
8 week Screening/Enrollment Wind ow the following will be repeated: Physical Examination, Performance 
Status Assessment, Complete Blood Count with differential and Platelet Count, Chemistry Panel, Pregnancy test, HIV and Hepatitis B/C tests, and ECHO scan.   
 
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814385] numbers will occur at initial consent, will be in sequential order  (i.e. [ZIP_CODE] -01, 
[ZIP_CODE] -02, etc .), and no numbers will be omitted. Subject numbers will be used on all study 
documentation.   Once assigned, the subject number must not be reused for any other subject and it must 
not be changed, even if the subject is rescreened.  
 
At the time a subject consents to participate in this study, a Consent Notification Form should be completed.  Once  required screening tests have been completed  and the subject has been determined 
eligible by [CONTACT_099] -investigator , provide the documents listed below to : 
 Sponsor Protocol Monitor and Sponsor Project Manager

ALC is ≥500/µl or absolute CD3 count is ≥150/µl.   
 The apheresis product is transported to th e CVPF for processing. A portion of the peripheral blood 
leukocytes will be saved for the TCSL laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania and used for baseline 
immunoassessment research assays  and biobanking, and the other portion used for huCART-meso  cell 
manufacturing  in CVPF . Baseline blood leukocytes for FDA look -back requirements will also be obtained 
and cryopreserved.  
 
Historical Apheresis Sample 
Cryopreserved historical apheresis products collected from the patient prior to study entry are usable for huCART -meso manufacturing if the sample was collected at an appropriately certified apheresis center 
and if the product meets adequate mononuclear ce ll yields. If a historical apheresis product is not 
available, an apheresis procedure (as described above) will be performed for cell procurement after study 
eligibility has been confirmed.  
6.3 Pre-infusion safety visit  (Week - 2 to -1) 
Subjects will undergo the following evaluations within [ADDRESS_814388] study infusion (unless 
otherwise specified below).  Please refer to the Schedule of Events in Appendices 1 -3. 
 
• Review of current medical conditions  
• Physical examination - including vital sign measurements, ECOG performance status, and review 
of concomitant medications. Vital sign measurements include weight, temperature, heart rate , 
blood pressure, and oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_406].  
• Complet e blood count and differential

lymphodepleting chemotherapy  administration . 
• A baseline tumor biopsy will be performed prior to huCART -meso infusion  (and administration of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy if applicable) , if the subject has an accessible tumor.  The baseline 
biopsy may occur any time prior to infusion between Day -[ADDRESS_814390] an accessible tumor or a biopsy is not felt to be 
clinically appropriate, an archived tumor tissue specimen may be obtained for research purposes.   
• Research blood sample collection - please refer to the Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendices 1 -3) 
for complete details . 
6.4 Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy A dministration  
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy  will be administered  prior to the huCART -meso cell infusion  for subjects 
participating in targeted cohorts  only : 
• Cohort s 2 and 6: a single  flat dose of 1 gram/m2 cyclophosphamide by [CONTACT_614205] 
2-[ADDRESS_814391] huCART -meso infusion.  Note: Cohort 4  (which also included 
Cyclophosphamide administration) was permanently closed with Protocol V5 .  
• Cohort 7:   cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2/day and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day given over [ADDRESS_814392] day of chemotherapy is 3 days (+/ - 1 day) prior to the 1st infusion of huCART -meso cells.  
Fludarabine doses will be roun ded down to the nearest 50 mg vial size, if the rounded dose does 
not differ by > 10% of the original dose prescribed.  
 The main goal of using lymphodepleting chemotherapy is to achieve lymphodepletion that may enhance 
engraftment of adoptive T cells, while minimizing complications from neutropenia. The proposed regimen has been used widely in other studies and has been tolerated well. At the discretion of the investigator, some subjects may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614129] . In this 
event, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614130]. 
 Prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy administration , subjects will undergo  tests/procedures 
performed according to the Schedule of Events in Appendices [ADDRESS_814393] be performed within 48 hours  prior to  initiating lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy . If already performed within this window, these laboratory tests do not need to be 
repeated on the  day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy .  Tests/procedures do not need to be repeated 
prior to subsequent lymphodepleting chemotherapy infusions unless clinically indicated.  
 Subjects who receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy, but in whom the huCART- meso infusion is 
subsequently delayed >[ADDRESS_814394] day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, may receive a second cycle of lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to huCART -meso infusion  at the clinical 
investigator’s discretion . 
 
The following criteria must be met in order to proceed with lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
administration :  
1) Subjects should not have received systemic chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the planned 
huCART -meso infusion.  If systemic chemotherapy was administered, then this procedure will be 
re-scheduled.

Version  11.11 -04-2022  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] . 2) Subjects must meet all concomitant therapy guidelines as outlined in Section 5.6 .  This includes 
restrictions on checkpoint inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3498], and receipt of prior anti -PD-1 or 
PDL1 therapy within 4 months of the planned huCART -meso infusion.  
3) Subjects who have received  chemotherapy or other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] > 2 weeks and < [ADDRESS_814395] recovered from all toxicities, including 
myelosuppression.  
4) Subjects should not experience a significant change in performance status compared to initial 
eligibility criteria that would, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], increase the ris k of 
experimental cell infusion.  
5) Subjects must not have laboratory abnormalities after enrollment that , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_614131], may impact subject safety or the subjects’ ability to receive 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or the huCART -meso cells. If this occurs, patients may have their 
treatment delayed until both the treating investigator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_614132].  
6) Subjects must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] (RVP , inclusive of SARS -CoV-2) within  [ADDRESS_814396] is positive for influenza, Tamiflu® or equivalent, should be 
administered per package insert. The subject must complete treatment prior to receiving 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The RVP does not need to be repeated prior to infusion; however, if influenza signs and symptoms are present, the infusions should be delayed until the subject is asymptomatic. If the subject is positive for another virus on the RVP, the infusions will 
be delayed for at least 7 days to be sure clinical symptoms of a viral infection do not develop , or 
longer if clinically appropriate for the respective pathogen. If clinical symptoms develop, the infusions will be delayed until resolution of these symptoms  
7) Subjects should not experience any of the following specific toxicities:  
a. Pulmonary: New requirement for supplemental oxygen or presence of progressive 
radiographic abnormalities on chest x -ray (chest x -ray is not required at this juncture but 
should be evaluated if performed for clinical purposes).    
b. Cardiac: New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management.  
c. Hypotension requiring pressor support.  
d. Active Infection: Positive blood cultures for bact eria, fungus, or virus within 48 -hours of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy . 
 
Anti-emetic prophylaxis : 
It is anticipated that subjects receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy may experience nausea and 
vomiting as a side effect of the treatment. Premedication for  nausea can be administered prior to infusion 
of chemotherapy. Choice of specific agent will be left to the discretion of the investigator. Corticosteroid  
treatment as anti- emetic prophylaxis prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy administration is allowed  
per institutional guidance  per Section 5.6.   
 Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended post lymphodepleting chemotherapy per institutional standards and practices for cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Potential Side Effects  
Chemotherapy is an integral part of this study and therefore subjects will be evaluated for toxicity that may be related to the chemotherapy conditioning regimen. See Section 1.7/Risks of cyclophosphamide  
and fludarabine  for complete information.

other laboratory testing are not required prior to the huCART -meso infusion except as necessary for 
investigator to evaluate criteria to proceed with the huCART -meso infusion as described below.  A CBC 
with differential and comprehensive chemistry panel must be performed within 48 hours prior to the huCART-meso infusion  (and after receipt of lymphodepleting chemotherapy if applicable). If already 
performed within this window, these laboratory tests do not need to be repeated on Day 0.   
 
The following criteria must be met in order to proceed with the hu CART -meso infusion:  
1) Subjects should not have received systemic chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the huCART -
meso infusion, with the exception of protocol -required lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
(applicable cohorts) .  If chemotherapy was administered, then this infusion will need to be re -
scheduled.  
2) Subjects  must meet all concomitant therapy guidelines as outlined in Section 5.6 .   
3) Subjects should not experience a significant change in performance status compared to initial 
eligibility criteria that would, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], increase the risk of experimental cell infusion.  
4) Subjects must not have laboratory abnormalities after enrollment that , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_614135], may impact subject safety or the subjects’ ability to receive huCART -

6.8.1  Safety Follow -up Visits ( Post Infusion #1) 
Subjects will have safety follow -up visits on Days 6 ( ±1), 9 (±1), and 14 ( ±1) post -infusion as per the Schedule 
of Events in Appendix 2 .  
6.8.2  Additional huCART-meso Infusion (s)  
Cohort 6 subjects  may receive up to two additional IV infusions of huCART -meso cells at the same dose 
level , if determined clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_099]- investigator.  Each additional infusio n may  be 
given approximately 21  and 42 days  after the Day 0 infusion, allowing for a +3 week window as needed.   
Therefore,  huCART -meso Infusion #2 is targeted for Day 21 (+3 weeks) and huCART -meso Infusion #3  is 
targeted for Day 42 (+ 3 weeks).  Additional  huCART -meso infusions performed outside of this window 
require approval from the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_614137]. The subject must be 
evaluated for the below criteria prior to each additional infusion .   Subjects will not receive 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to additional huCART -meso infusions.  
 
The following criteria must be met in order to proceed with additional infusions of huCART -meso cells :  
1) Subjects must have manufactured huCART -meso cell product available which meets the minimum 
acceptable dose for infusion ( 1x106 huCART -meso cells/m2).  
2) Subjects should not experience a significant change in performance or clinical status that would, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_614138] -investigator or PI, increase the risk of experimental cell 
infusion.  
3) Subjects experiencing laboratory abnormalities that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_156700]- investigator 
or PI, may impact subject safety or the subjects’ ability to receive huCA RT-meso cells, may have 
their infusion delayed until determined to be clinically appropriate to proceed with the CAR T cell infusion. If this occurs, patients may have their treatment delayed until both the treating investigator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_614132].  
4) Subjects should not be experiencing signs/symptoms of an active infection.

opi[INVESTIGATOR_021]- investigator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_614139] -meso cells .   
6) Subjects should not be  experiencing signs/symptoms of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or other 
severe CAR T cell related toxicities.   
7) Subjects must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] (RVP , inclusive of SARS -CoV-2) within [ADDRESS_814407] is positive for influenza, Tamiflu® or 
equivalent, should be administered per package insert. The subject must complete treatment 
prior to receiving huCART -meso cells. The RVP does not need to be repeated prior to infusion; 
however, if influenza signs and symptoms are present, the infusion should be delayed until the subject is asymptomatic. If the subject is positive for another virus on the RVP, the infusion will 
be delayed for at least 7 days to be sure clinical symptoms of a viral infection do not develop , or 
longer if clinically appropriate for the respective pathogen. If clinical symptoms develop, the infusion will be delayed until resolution of these symptoms.  
 If the additional huCART -meso infusion s are delayed  by [CONTACT_7809] 7 days  or not performed  for any 
reason , the  additional infusion study visits [ at Day 21 and Day 42] will still be performed as scheduled, 
however they will be repurposed as a safety follow -up visit only.   These safety follow- up visits will be 
identified as the actual study visit from Day 0 (i.e. Day 26), and should be performed within +7 days of the planned study timepoint.  If the  additional  huCART -meso infusio ns are then subsequently performed  
within  the protocol allowable window (+3 weeks), the actual infusion day will be calculated as the act ual 
study visit day from Day 0 (i.e. Day 35) and the study visit assessments required for an infusion visit  will 
be rep eated prior to the infusion as per the Schedule of Events (Appendix 2 ).  
 
The subject will remain inpatient for observation for  a minimum of [ADDRESS_814408] will undergo vital sign assessments ( temperature, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate , blood pressure, and oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_406] ) every 4 -6 hours (+/-

Additional monitoring may be performed per clinical discretion.  Subjects will also undergo physical 
examinations, clinical labs, and collection of research samples as per the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 
2).   
 Additional assessments will be performed as deemed clinically appropriate. Should evidence of cytokine release syndrome or respi[INVESTIGATOR_614140], the subject will be supported as noted in Section 
9.4.[ADDRESS_814410]-Infusion Safety Follow -up (Infusions #2 and #3)  
As described above, the  additional huCART -meso  infusions  may be performed within a +3 week window  
from the targeted infusion days i.e. [Day 21 (+3 weeks) and Day 42 (+3 weeks)] . Given the allowable 
window for these additional infusions, the timing of the post -infusion safety follow -up visits will be 
dependent on the actual timing of the additional huCART-meso infusion s as follows .  
• The timing of the post-infusion safety follow -up visits will be calculated as the actual  study day  
they occurred  post  Infusion #2 and Infusion #3 (i.e. + [ADDRESS_814411] Infusion #2,+[ADDRESS_814412] Infusion 
#2, +[ADDRESS_814413] Infusion #3, etc.). This should be record ed as the actual study day , even if a n

visits.   
• In addition, the actual study visit day calculated from Day 0 (the initial huCART -meso infusion) 
must also be captured  (i.e. Day 30, Day 31, etc) .   
• Example:  
• Infusion # + Study Visit Day Post Additional Infusion/Study Visit Day from Day 0  
• Infusion #2 Day +6/Day 28  
• Both time points  must be reported for  tests/procedures performed during post -infusion safety 
follow -up visits for Infusion #2 and Infusion #3  only .  
 
In addition to the required inpatient observation Day +1 and +[ADDRESS_814414] safety follow -up visits on Day +6 ( ±1), +9 ( ±1), and +14 ( ±1) post each infusion 
as per the Schedule of Events in Appendix 2 .  An additional safety follow -up visit will be performed Day 
+21 ( ±1) after the last huCART -meso infusion.   If an infusion is omitted, these post -infusion safety follow -
up visits will not be required.  If an infusion is delayed, these additional safety follow -up visits will be 
shifted to align with the timing of the infusion  (as indicated above) . Please refer to the Cohort 6 Schedule 
of Events in Appendix 2  for complete details.  
 
Day +14 (±7) Post the huCART -meso Infusion  #2: 
• Tumor Biopsy:  
o If the subject’s tumor is measurable by [CONTACT_614206] -guided biopsy, 
subjects will undergo a tumor biopsy under image guidance to evaluate the impact of 
therapy on the tumor microenvironment and to assess for the presence of CAR T cells and 
mesothelin expression. These will be compared to baseline values from fresh biopsies or 
stored surgical tumor specimens, if available. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for 
complete details.

status ) will be performed. A CT scan within 4 weeks of this visit is acceptable. Tumor response will be 
assessed as described in Section 7.1 . 
6.8.5  Month 6 (+/- 5 days): Safety and Tumor Staging  
The timing of this study visit will be calculated from the initial huCART -meso infusion (Day 0). At this study 
visit, subjects will undergo tests and procedures in accordance with the Schedule of Events in  Appendix 
2.  In addition, tumor staging (CT imaging as clinically indicated as per patient population and disease 
status ) will be performed.  A CT scan within [ADDRESS_814416] infusion or until the 
subjects’ progress and/or initiate another cancer -related therapy. The timing of these study visits will be 
calculated from the initial huCART -meso infusion (Day 0). At these study visits, subjects will undergo tests 
and procedures in accordance with the Schedule of Events in Appendix 2.   
6.[ADDRESS_814417] -Infusion Visits (Cohort 7)  
6.9.1  Safety Follow -up Visits ( Post Infusion #1) 
Subjects will have safety follow -up visits on Days 6 ( ±1), 9 (±1), and 14 ( ±1) post -infusion as per the Schedule 
of Events in Appendix [ADDRESS_814418]’s tumor is measurable by [CONTACT_614206] -guided biopsy, subjects w ill undergo a 
tumor biopsy at Day 14 (+/- 7 days) after the 1st huCART -meso infusion (Day 0).  This biopsy sample will 
be used to evaluate the impact of therapy on the tumor microenvironment and to assess for the presence of CAR T cells and mesothelin expression.  These samples will be compared to baseline values from fresh 
biopsies or stored surgical tumor specimens, if available.  Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for 
complete details.   
6.9.2  Additional huCART -meso Infusion(s)  
Cohort 7 subjects may receive up to two additional infusions of huCART -meso cells via intravenous (IV) 
administration at the same dose level, if determined clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_099]- investigator.  
Each additional infusion may be given approximately 21 and 42 days after the Day 0 infusion, allowing for a +3 week window as needed.  Therefore, huCART- meso Infusion #2 is targeted for Day 21 (+3 weeks) and 
huCART -meso Infusion #3 is targeted for Day 42 (+ 3 weeks).  Additional huCART -meso infusions  
performed outside of this window require approval from the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_614137]. The subject must be evaluated for the below criteria prior to each additional infusion.   Subjects 
will not receive lymphodepleting chemotherap y prior to additional huCART -meso infusions.  
 
The following criteria must be met in order to proceed with additional infusions of huCART -meso cells:  
1) Subjects must have manufactured huCART -meso cell product available which meets the minimum 
acceptable dose  for infusion ( 1x106 huCART -meso cells/m2).  
2) Subjects should not experience a significant change in performance or clinical status that would, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021] -investigator or PI, increase the risk of experimental cell 
infusion.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] . 3) Subjects experiencing laboratory abnormalities that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_156700]- investigator 
or PI, may impact subject safety or the subjects’ ability to receive huCART- meso cells, may have 
their infusion delayed until determined to be clinically approp riate to proceed with the CAR T cell 
infusion. If this occurs, patients may have their treatment delayed until both the treating 
investigator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_614132].  
4) Subjects should not be experiencing signs/symptoms of a n active infection.  
5) Subjects should not be experiencing any ongoing treatment -related grade > 3 events, that in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_021]- investigator and PI [INVESTIGATOR_614139] -meso cells.   
6) Subjects should not be experiencing signs/symptoms of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or other 
severe CAR T cell related toxicities.   
7) Subjects must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] (RVP , inclusive of SARS -CoV-2) within [ADDRESS_814419] is positive for influenza, Tamiflu® or 
equivalent, should be administered per package insert. The subject must complete treatment 
prior to receiving huCART -meso cells. The RVP does not need to be repeated prior to infusion; 
how ever, if influenza signs and symptoms are present, the infusion should be delayed until the 
subject is asymptomatic. If the subject is positive for another virus on the RVP, the infusion will 
be delayed for at least 7 days to be sure clinical symptoms of a  viral infection do not develop , or 
longer if clinically appropriate for the respective pathogen. If clinical symptoms develop, the infusion will be delayed until resolution of these symptoms.  
 If the additional huCART -meso infusions are delayed by [CONTACT_7809] 7 days or not performed for any 
reason, the additional infusion study visits [at Day 21 and Day 42] will still be performed as scheduled, however they will be repurposed as a safety follow -up visit only.  These safety follow -up visits will be 
identif ied as the actual study visit from Day 0 (i.e. Day 26), and should be performed within +7 days of the 
planned study timepoint.  If the additional huCART -meso infusions are then subsequently performed 
within the protocol allowable window (+3 weeks), the actual infusion day will be calculated as the actual study visit day from Day 0 (i.e. Day 35) and the study visit assessments required for an infusion visit will be repeated prior to the infusion as per the Schedule of Events (Appendix 3 ).  
 The subject will remain inpatient for observation for a minimum of [ADDRESS_814420] will undergo vital sign assessments ( temperature, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate , blood pressure, and oxygen saturation by [CONTACT_406] ) every 4 -6 hours (+/ - 
30 minutes) from the end of the infusion vital sign monitoring period until [ADDRESS_814421] infusion.  
Additional monitoring may be performed per clinical discretion.  Subjects will also undergo physical examinations, clinical labs, and collection of research samples as per the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 
3).   
 Additional assessments will be performed as deemed clinically appropriate. Should evide nce of cytokine 
release syndrome or respi[INVESTIGATOR_614140], the subject will be supported as noted in  Section 
9.4.[ADDRESS_814422]-Infusion Safety Follow -up (Infusions #2 and #3)  
As described above, the additional huCART -meso infusions may be performed within a +3 week window 
from the targeted infusion days i.e. [Day 21 (+3 weeks) and Day 42 (+3 weeks)]. Given the allowable 
window for these additional infusions, the timing of the post -infusion safety follow -up visits will be 
dependent on the actual timing of the additional huCART -meso infusions as follows.  
• The timing of the post -infusion safety follow -up visits will be calculated as the actual  study day 
they occurred post Infusion #2 and Infusion #3 (i.e. + [ADDRESS_814423] Infusion #2,  +[ADDRESS_814424] Infusion 
#2, +[ADDRESS_814425] Infusion #3, etc.). This should be recorded as the actu al study day, even if an 
assessment falls within the allowable visit window (i.e. Day +6 visit occurs on Day +7, record as 
Day +7).  This guidance applies to the timing of study procedures (i.e. imaging, etc) as well as study visits.   
• In addition, the act ual study visit day calculated from Day 0 (the initial huCART -meso infusion) 
must also be captured (i.e. Day 30, Day 31, etc).   
• Example:  
• Infusion # + Study Visit Day Post Additional Infusion/Study Visit Day from Day 0  
• Infusion #2 Day +6/Day 28  
• Both timepo ints must be reported for tests/procedures performed during post -infusion safety 
follow -up visits for Infusion #2 and Infusion #3 only .  
 
In addition to the required inpatient observation Day +1 and +[ADDRESS_814426] safety follow -up visits on Day +6 ( ±1), +9 ( ±1), and +14 ( ±1) post each infusion 
as per the Schedule of Events in Appendix [ADDRESS_814427] -infusion safety follow -
up visits will not be required.  If an infusion is delayed, these additional safety follow -up visits will be 
shifted to align with the timing of the infusion (as indicated above). Please refer to the Cohort 7 Schedule 
of Events in Appendix 3  for complete details.  
 
Day +14 (±7) Post the huCART -meso Infusion #2:  
• Tumor Imaging  
• Tumor Biomarkers  
• 60mL blood draw - for research purposes  
 If huCART -meso Infusion #[ADDRESS_814428] -infusion tumor imaging will be 
performed at the time the decision is made by [CONTACT_099] -investigator not to administer additional 
infusions.  Tumor imaging may also be performed at any  time as per clinical discretion.  
 
Day + 14 (±7) Post the 3rd huCART -meso Infusio n: 
• 60mL blood draw - for research purposes  
 If a subject does  not receive either huCART -meso Infusion #2 or Infusion #3, the subject will undergo this 
60mL blood draw at the D ay 42 (+7) Safety Follow -up Visit, which still must be performed in the absence 
of Infusion #3.  
 In case of unexpected AEs or SAEs, additional samples may also be collected for research analysis, focused at evaluating the potential causality with the infu sed huCART -meso cells see Section 3.3 /Collection of 
Research Samples.

subjects will undergo tests and procedures in accordance with the Schedule of Events in Appendix 3.   
6.10  Long -term Follow -up Protocol 
All infused  subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue participation in this study  (as defined in 
Section 4.5.1 ), will be asked to participate in a separate 15 -year long -term follow -up destination protocol. 
This long- term follow -up protocol includes evaluations performed for up to 15 years on all subjects as 
recommended by [CONTACT_614207].  
7 ASSESSMENTS 
7.1 Disease  Assessments  
All subjects who receive the target dose of huCAR T-meso  cells infusion  will be considered evaluable for 
response  [including progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)]. All subjects with 
radiologically confirmed measurable disease (per RECIST 1.1) at baseline will also be considered evaluable 
for overall radio logic response (ORR).  
 
Radiographic Imaging  
Participants will undergo radiographic imaging by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI with or without contrast.  Baseline scans should 
be obtained within [ADDRESS_814430] infusion imaging will be performed as des cribed in the Schedule of Events ( Appendices 1 -3). 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation 
by [CONTACT_332529] -tumor effect of a treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] . Radiographic Response  
Radiographic responses will be measured using two imaging assessmen t approaches: 1) Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST  1.1) and 2) immune related response criteria (irRC)  when 
feasible . Note: irRC will not be evaluated in mesothelioma subjects.  
 
For RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_814431] of the treatment. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is the preferred 
method for the tumor assessment. Tumor assessment  scans may be performed with or without contrast.  
Because immune therapy can cause an initial tumor volume increase due to inflammation prior to subsequent tumor shrinkage, an exploratory analysis of response status will also be conducted using the 
recently developed immune related response criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al., 2009 ). Novel to the irRC is the 
measurement of overall tumor burden as a metric of disease progression, compared to the limitation of 
using only baseline lesion measurements according to RECIST  1.1. According the irRC, new lesions do not 
constitute disease progression if net tumor burden including new lesions is stable or decreases.  The irRC 
also permit disease progression at a subsequent time  point after first detection. This accounts for the 
period required for activated T -cells to infiltrate the tumor, which may cause initial tumor volume increase 
due to inflammation but can subse quently translate into tumor shrinkage. The irRC also classify durable 
stable disease as clinical activity. Thus, this protocol will explore two distinct imaging criteria for determination of disease outcome in response to treatment with  huCART -meso  cells.   
 
Tumor biomarkers  
Tumor biomarkers as appropriate for each malignancy will also be measured.   For ovarian cancer patients, 
CA125 will be measured. There are no clinical tumor markers routinely evaluated in mesothelioma 
patients.  
 Mesothelin is the receptor for CA125, and the interaction between mesothelin and CA125 is thought to play a role in tumor progression  (details in Section 1.7 ). Therefore, binding of mesothelin by [CONTACT_614208] -meso 
cells may directly affect the level of circulating CA125 irrespective of disease activity. Therefore, tumor 
biomarker assessment alone is not suffic ient to determine response or progression in this study.   
7.2 Research Correlative Studies Assessment  
7.2.1  Collection of Research Samples  
Research samples (including peripheral blood, fluid, and tumor tissue) will be obtained at defined time points to monitor for measures of safety and T cell persistence. This includes an image -guided minimally 
invasive biopsy pre -infusion and post -infusion for research purposes.  Please refer to the Schedule of 
Events ( Appendices 1 -3) for required time points.  
 In case of unexpected AEs or SAEs, additional samples may also be collected for research analysis, focused at evaluating the potential causality with the infused huCART -meso cells. Additional blood work for 
research evaluation may also be requested at any time at the investigators’ discretion, and is especially encouraged whenever there is a clinical concern for a potential toxicity related to huCART -meso cells, but 
also for patients with an unusual efficacy; additional studies may identify critical biomarkers of potency

CONFIDENTIAL

tablespoons of blood twice in a week, and one procedure for collecting tissue/lymph node samples in a 
month.  
 
Tissue samples (e.g. fluids, tissue biopsy) that are obtained as part of standard of care procedures for 
clinical indications will also be sent for research analysis , wherever feasible . Fluid samples that would 
otherwise be discarded may also be diverted  for research pur poses .   
7.2.2  Planned Correlati ve Studies  
The planned correlative studies are as follows:  
1. Determine the persistence of huCART -meso cells in peripheral blood.  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells’ DNA will be evaluated by Q -PCR using a validated assay that 
detects a fragment unique to the CAR sequence . PBMC may also be used for a flow cytometry 
based assay for determination of huCART -meso  cells. These analyses will be performed in bulk on 
each patient on peripheral blood,  tumor  derived material where available , or other tissues/fluids  
(ascites, pleural fluid, etc.) .  CAR T cell vector sequences will be performed at pre - and all post -
infusion study visits  as outline d in the Schedule of Events (Appendices 1 -3).  Additional testing 
may also be performed at unscheduled time  points at the discretion of the  Sponsor.  This analysis 
will continue  until any [ADDRESS_814432], if feasible.  
2. Determine the bioactivity of huCART -meso cells in peripheral blood.   
Serum or fluid (e.g. ascites) will be analyzed using Luminex and ELISA Technologies to determine 
the presence of a panel of cytokines/chemokines/immune factors. Measurements will be performed in bulk to maximize utilization of immune assay kits. In addition, bioactivity of the 
manufactured and infused huCART -meso cells may be assessed by [CONTACT_614209] a mesothelin -
expressing cell line.  
3. Evaluate the development of immune responses favoring rejection of huCART -meso cells  (where 
scientifically relevant) . Development of HACA antibody responses are expected to result in 
elimination of huCART -meso cells. Cellular immune responses directed to the modified T cells may 
also develop and be measured. Correlate  the occurrence of antibody responses with loss of 
engraftment of CAR T cells.  
4. Evaluate the development of secondary anti-tumor responses as a consequence of huCART -meso 
cells. Tumor cell death mediated by [CONTACT_614208] -meso cells may expose the immune system to new 
antigens, leading to new immune responses directed to the tumor. The development of new antibodies and cellular immune responses that develop to established tumor cell lines may be 
assessed and displayed as appropriate to each assay. This will be determined using Protoarray  or 
other appropriate technologies,  or via next -generation sequencing of T cell receptor and 
immunoglobulin rearrangements in the tumor at baseline and post -infusion.  
5. Where tumor material or body fluids can be obtained:  
a. Measure trafficking of huCART -meso cells;   
b. Evaluate mesothelin expression on tumor cells to assess for antigen -escape.  
c. Evaluate genetic editing (if feasible)  
d. Analyze tumor microenvironment and cell interactions (if feasible) - Immune correlates 
such as local immune activation (using qRT -PCR); the breath and hierarchy of the B and 
T cell repertoire via deep sequencing and compare with baseline specimens.  
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814433] Population(s) for Analysis  
• The Screened Set  comprises all subjects who are consented to participate  in this study.  
• The Enrolled Set comprises all subjects who are determined eligible to participate in the study  
(excluding screen failure ).   
• The Safety Evaluable Set  comprises all subjects who receive the target dose of huCART-meso 
cells per their cohort assignment. The Safety Set will be used for primary safety and feasibility 
analysis, official DLT evaluations, and cohort advancement decisions.  
• The Efficacy Evaluable Set comprises all subjects who receive the huCART -meso cells at their 
cohort assigned dose level  and who have at least one post -infusion disease assessment 
available . Efficacy evaluable subjects also include those with disease progression or death prior 
to completion of study safety visits. The Efficacy Evaluable Set will be used for the secondary efficacy endpoint analysis.   
• The Efficacy Non- Evaluable Set  comprises subjects who receive huCART -meso at lower than 
intended dose  or do not have at least one post- infusion disease assessment available .  These 
subjects will be evaluable for safety, but will not be evaluable for response.  These subjects will also not be included in official DLT evaluations  or cohort advancement decision s, thus will 
be replaced in that cohort.  
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  comprises all subjects who received the huCART -meso cells. This 
set includes both evaluable and efficacy  non-evaluable  subjects and will be used for the 
primary safety and feasibility, and secondary correlative endpoints or other exploratory 
analyses.  
 A second population of subjects in the Enrolled Set  include s subjects eligible for participation in the study 
but who do not receive huCART-meso  cells. Reasons subjects do not receive cell infusions are likely to 
include 1) ineffective transduction of autologous T cells  or an inability to manufacture an infusible dose ; 
2) rapid progression, clinical deterioration, and/or death between the time of enrollment and infusion;  
and 3) subject withdrawal.  Subjects who do not receive therapy will be replaced as detailed in Section 
4.4.3 . 
 The number of subjects in the Enrolled Set  versus the number of subjects in the Safety Evaluable  Set will 
be described and is a measure of the feasibility of this therapy.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530] . 8.4 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 
The primary safety endpoint will be evaluated using the Safety Evaluable Set, to determine the safety of huCART -meso cells based on the type, frequency, severity, and attribution of AE/SAEs and the occurrence 
of DLTs. DLT an d adverse events will be collected and evaluated for all subjects during the protocol 
specified AE reporting period. AEs will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) – 
Common Terminology Criteria (v4.03). All adverse events will be  described using descriptive statistics and 
exact 90% confidence intervals will be produced for adverse event rates, both overall and within major categories. Results will be tabulated and summarized, both overall and by [CONTACT_614210].   
 Feasibility endpoints will be evaluated using the Enrolled Set as follows:  
• Study feasibility will be summarized as the proportion of subjects who receive huCART -meso  cells 
out of the number of subjects enrolled, as well as the proportion of subjects who c annot receive 
all planned doses of huCART -meso cells.   
• Manufacturing feasibility will be evaluated by:  
o The proportion of huCART -meso products that meet release criteria as measured by [CONTACT_614211] T cell numbers, out of the number of subjects enrol led with products 
manufactured; and  
o The proportion of huCART -meso products that meet the targeted dose, out of the number 
of subjects enrolled with products manufactured. huCART -meso products that fail to 
meet the intended dose are considered dose failures.  
 
8.5 Analysis of Secondary  Endpoints  
For the preliminary efficacy endpoints, overall response rate (ORR), progression -free survival (PFS), and 
overall survival (OS) will be evaluated as follows:  
o Objective response rate (ORR):  will be computed as proportions with exact 90% confidence 
interval.  Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects in the efficacy -
evaluable set with radiologically confirmed measurable disease at baseline, who achieved partial resp onse (PR) or better after infusion as determined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1. Missing or non -
evaluable time points will not be included.  
o Progression -free survival (PFS): Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the 
date of the infusion to the date of first documented disease progression (per RECIST 1.1) or 
death (from any cause), or censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. PFS will be described using Kaplan -Meier curves.  
o Overall Survival (OS): Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of the infusion to the date of death from any cause. If a subject is not known to have died at the date of analysis cut-off, OS will be censored at the last date of contact. OS will be estimated using Kaplan -
Meier curves.  Median survival times and survival probabilities at selected time points (e.g., 6-, 12-months) will be presented.

9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related .  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse 
events.   
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• leads to a persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614141]:  
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration 
in condition, such as preplanned study visits and preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614142]  
• Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
• Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general 
condition  
 Note : Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379178] a SAE given above is not a serious adverse event.    Important medi cal events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious shou ld be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
9.1.3  Unexpected adverse events  
An adverse eve nt is consid ered unexpected if the event , and/or severity of the event (grade), is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the investigator brochure and/ or protocol.    
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814434], intervention, or research -required procedures.  
For the  purposes of this study , "rea sona ble poss ibility" means the re is evid ence to sugge st a ca usal 
relation ship.   The relationship of the event to the study will be classified as possibly related, probably related, 
and definitely related.  
• Possibly Related : There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship; however, other 
factors may have contributed to the event.  
• Probably Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely.  
• Definitely Related: There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_814435] (UADE)  
(Note: Device refers to the Mesothelin Immunohistochemistry Test required for screening in subjects 
enrolled prior to Protocol Amendment V9 only ) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or  any 
life threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or 
application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
9.1.6  Protocol -defined Adverse Event  
If/when alternative treatment is initiated post -huCART -meso administration , adverse event data 
collection /reporting requirements will be reduced . As of the start date of any new treatment, only 
protocol -defined advers
e events (PDAEs) will be collected and reported.  Any events ongoing at the 
time alternative treatment is initiated must continue to be followed through resolution.    
 
Protocol -defi
ned adverse events that are also determined to be serious, as defined in Section 9.1.2  above , 
will be considered protocol -defined serious adverse events (PDSAEs) and will require expedited reporting 
to the sponsor per  Section 9.3.  
 PDAEs are defined as  follows:  
1) New incidence
 or exacerbation of a pre -existing neuro
logic disorder  
2) New incidence
 or exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder  
3) New incidence of hematologic disorder  
4) New malignancy (T cell & non T cell)  
5) Any adverse event or condition the investigator believes may have a reasonable relationship to  
CAR T cell therapy (including unexpected illnesses or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614143])  
 
The following correlative laboratory results will also constitute a protocol-defined adverse event, however these events will be identified by [CONTACT_614212]/site and FDA:  
1) Positive RCL test result  
2) Vector insertion site sequencing result with a mono - or oligoclonal vector integration pattern or 
in a location near a known human oncogene.

Collection of adverse events will begin at the time of initiation of study treatment (lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy or huCART -meso cell infusion depending on cohort assignment)  and continue until the 
subject is off- study as follows:   
• For the Time Period Beginning with the Initiation of Study Treatment and Until  Alternative 
Therapy for their Disease  is Administered :  
o All adverse events must be reported. The subject’s complete baseline medical history will 
be collected prior to the initiation of study treatment.  
• At the Time Alternative Therapy for their Disease is Initiated:  
o Subjects will only be followed for protocol- defined adverse events (PDAEs). Any events 
ongoing at the time alternative treatment is initiated must continue to be followed 
through resolution.   
o PDAE reporting will continue until the end of study (EOS).  
9.1.8 Preexisting Condition/General Physical Examination Findings  
A preexisting condition is one that is present prior to the start of the Adverse Event Reporting Period .  All 
clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as a preexisting condition on the medical history 
eCRF. During the course of the study, a preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens.  Preexisting conditions that improve should also be recorded appropriately.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_814436] result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported adverse event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event. Laboratory abnormalities that do not meet 
the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as adverse events.  A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious defined above and/or as per investigator’s discretion.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom should be provided (i.e. anemia instead of low hemoglobin).   
9.2 Recording  of Adverse Events  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_614213] (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_814437] also been developed to more 
appropriately capture events of Cytokine Release Syndrome ( Table 9.2-1) and CAR Neurotoxicity ( Table 
9.2-2).  
 Subjects will be monitored through interval medical history evaluations, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory assessments as per the Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendices 1 -3). Adverse events will

directive questioning (e.g. review of systems), subject self -reporting, etc.  
 
Information on all adverse events should be recorded in the source documentation.  All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. To the extent possible,  adverse events should be recorded 
as a diagnosis and symptoms used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis event.  Do not list symptoms  or abnormal diagnostic results separately  if a diagnosis can be assigned. The safety team may 
require event s be reported separately if they occur as SAEs (or in the context of a SAE) even if they can also 
be considered a constituent of another AE such as CRS.  
 All adverse events occurring during the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 9.1. 7 above) 
must be recorded. If there are no adverse events identified during a study visit occurring after the AE 
reporting p eriod commences, physician -investigator confirmation of the absence of adverse should be 
documented.   
 As much as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1. Severity /Grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -5) 
2. Duration  
3. Its relationship to the study treatment (as defined in  Section 9.1.4 ) 
4. Expectedness to study treatment (as defined in Section 9.1.3) 
5. Action taken with respect to the investigational treatment  
6. Whether medication or therapy was administered  
7. Whether it is serious, as  defined  in Section 9.1.2  
 Physician -investigator assessment of whether an adverse event is serious (as defined by  [CONTACT_8985] 9.1.2 ) 
must occur within 24 hours from the date of knowledge of the adverse event in order to meet SAE 
reporting requirements described in  Section 9.3 . Additional assessment of non -serious adverse events, 
including grade and relationship to study treatment, should occur within 7 days from the date of knowledge of the adverse event or from the date of the study visit where the absence of adverse events was confirmed. Accelerated timelines for adverse event assessments and reporting may be requested in 
the event of emergent safety concerns and/or to address time -sensitive requests from the DSMB/FDA.    
 All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non -drug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its 
resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and evaluated for any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
 Progression of malignancy, documented appropriately in the medical records, should not be reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events that occur concurrently with the progression of malignancy but that are not related to dise ase progression (i.e. deep vein thrombosis or hemoptysis) will be reported as 
an adverse event as described above.  Progression of malignancy resulting in death should be reported as a serious adverse event.  
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the adverse event reporting period must be 
followed to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the adverse event reporting period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study parti cipation, 
should be recorded and reported.

 In addition to the above, p remature termination of the clinical trial may  also occur because of a regulatory 
authority decision, change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100],  determination that  there are problems  in the cell product 
generation, as a result of safety concern, or at the discretion of the PI.  Additionally, recruitment may be stopped for reasons of particularly low recruitment, protocol violations, or inadequate data recording.

to be infused with huCART -meso  cells only. If 2 DLTs occur at the de- escalated dose, the 
study will be stopped.

Replication -competent lentivirus (RCL ) 
RCL may in theory be generated during the CAR T cell manufacturing phase or subsequently after introduction of vector transduced cells into the subject. However, an RCL resulting from the production phase is highly unlikely since elements are incorporated in the design of the vector system that minimize 
vector recombination and generation of RCL. Furthermore, the vector used to transduce the product undergoes sensitive assays to confirm that the vector is RCL negative before it can be released for use in product manufacture. Though theoretical, development of RCL could pose a risk to both the subject and 
their close contact(s), and therefore, samples will be archived during the course of the trial. In the event of a suspected RCL, measures to detect RCL will  be followed per the recent FDA guidance, Testing of 
Retroviral Vector -Based Human Gene Therapy Products for Replication Competent Retrovirus During 
Product Manufacture and Patient Follow -up. 
 
Clonalit y and inse rtiona l oncogenesis 
Monitoring for T cell clonal outgrowth will be performed by [CONTACT_614217] -expressing cells and/or 
flow cytometric analysis (if feasible), and by [CONTACT_379226].  If during long- term follow -up > 1% of the subject’s 
sample is positive for vector sequences  by [CONTACT_62865], then the subject will be asked to return for a confirmatory 
blood test prior to the next study visit.  If > 1% of the subject’s sample is positive upon the receipt of the confirmatory qPCR result, then the genomic vector integration sites will be  determined.  Identified vector 
integration sites will be evaluated using bioinformatics approaches to determine if the integration events are in regions with known relationships to human cancers (i.e. near oncogenes).    
 If integration site analysis reve als mono - or oligoclonality and/or integration at or near an oncogenic locus, 
a monitoring plan, including follow -up molecular analyses, will be developed in collaboration between the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_614147].  
 
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814442] can be rete sted  for sterility using archived samples that a re 
store d in the CVPF.  Consideration of a cytokine release syndrome (see below) should be given.   
 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) / Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)  
Selective tocilizumab therapy has been utilized (described below) to manage CRS/MAS toxicity without precluding CAR T cell expansion in subjects. Steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be 
used as pre -medication for CAR T cell therapy but may be considered in the management of CRS.  
 The moderate to severe cases of CRS observed required intervention with single dose tocilizumab with or without high dose corticosteroids, between [ADDRESS_814443] but not all subjects.  Given the clinical improvement of subjects after treatment with anti -cytokin e therapy, subjects with 
moderate to severe cytokine toxicities should be managed with administration of tocilizumab.  
 Tocilizumab should be used as a single, weight -based dose of 8 mg/kg at the time of hemodynamic 
instability. This management approach is  designed to avoid life -threatening toxicities, while attempting 
to allow the CAR T cells to establish a proliferative phase that appears to correlate with clinical efficacy. Thus, the timing of the tocilizumab should be individualized, in close consultati on with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or expert consultants for the trial.  Steroids have not always been effective in this setting and may not be necessary given the rapid response to tocilizumab. Because steroids are thought to interfere with CAR T cell function and efficacy, if used, they should be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_333379].  
 
Upon developi[INVESTIGATOR_614148] T cell infusion, subjects should then be 
followed closely. Infection and tumor lysis syndrome work up should be immediately u ndertaken.  The 
pharmacy should be notified of the potential need for tocilizumab.  Subject management in an intensive care unit may be required and the timing is dependent upon local institutional practice. In addition to supportive care, tocilizumab may be administered in cases of moderate to severe CRS, especially if the subject exhibits any of the following:  
• Hemodynamic instability despi[INVESTIGATOR_614149]  
• Worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], including pulm onary infiltrates, increasing oxygen requirement 
including high -flow O
2, and/or need for mechanical ventilation.  
• Any other signs or symptoms of rapid deterioration despi[INVESTIGATOR_614150] 8 mg/kg (maximum indi vidual dose of 800 mg) i.v. every 8 
hours for a maximum of four doses; this is the dosing specified in the tocilizumab product label for 
huCART -meso in Mesothelin Expressing Cancers  Page [ADDRESS_814444]’s 
physiologic reserve.  
 
Other anti -cytokine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as repeat administration of tocilizumab or use of siltuximab or 
etanercept, may also be considered if the patient does not respond to the initial dose of tocil izumab.  If 
the patient experiences ongoing CRS despi[INVESTIGATOR_560509] -cytokine directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], anti T -cell 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614151], ATG, campath may be considered.   
 
A detailed treatment algorithm has been established with clear criteria for CRS management following 
CART -19 administration and guidance on when to administer tocilizumab ( Figure 9.4-1
). This approach 
was designed to avoid life -threatening toxicities, while attempting to allow the CART-19 transduced cells 
to establish a proliferative phase which appears to correlate with tumor response. The management of CRS is based solely upon clinical parameters. This algorithm may be used to guide  CRS management 
related to huCART -meso treatment; however, changes specific to the huCART -meso should be considered 
and based on clinical judgment . Specific CRFs have been developed for the capture of CRS elements, 
severity, management and response  to intervention.

It is possible that serositis, peritonitis, or pleuropericarditis could occur due to normal mesothelin 
expression on serosal surfaces. Relevant information on the occurrence of serositis is available from the study done at the NCI testing an anti -mesotheli n pseudomonas exotoxin conjugate (SS1P) (Hassan, 
Bullock, et al. 2007 ). SS1P was given by [CONTACT_614218] 34 patients. The DLT was Grade 3 pleuritis 
and was seen in two of two patients treated at a dose of 60 μg/kg and in one of nine patients treated at a dose of 45μg/kg. The DLT of pleuritis was characterized by [CONTACT_411], hypoxia, pleural effusion, and pain. 
Pleuritis developed after the second dose of SS1P in one patient and after the third dose in two patients. The clinical presentation was pleuritic pain leadin g to hypoxia due to hypoventilation. Chest x -ray showed 
unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion. Patients were treated with supplemental oxygen and narcotics for pain relief. Pain and hypoxia resolved within [ADDRESS_814445] has significant 
clinical symptoms, supportive care and therapy to ablate the huCART -meso cells should be considered.  
 
Management : In the event of symptomatic pleuritis, pericarditis, or peritonitis following T cells, 
patient will have an investigation to exclude infectious causes, and then will be treated with anti-inflammatory agents per physician preference. T cell ablating therapie s include corticosteroids, 
chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, or immunotherapy such as alemtuzumab may also be considered at the investigators’ discretion. In the event of fluid accumulation, these cavities can be quickly and readily accessed in a minimally invasive fashion to remove the fluid as anti- lymphocyte 
therapy is initiated. Patient will be monitored by [CONTACT_461], laboratory tests, x- ray and EKG for the 
development of serositis.  
 
Anaphylaxis  
According to our experience treating 14 subjects with SS1 CAR mRNA T cells (7 mesothelioma subjects 
under UPCC# [ZIP_CODE], 6 pancreatic cancer subjects under UPCC# [ZIP_CODE], and one pancreatic cancer subject under UPCC# [ZIP_CODE]), anaphylaxis is a rare but possible toxicity created by [CONTACT_614219] T cells infusion s 
with long periods of time between infusions (Please refer to the huCART -meso Investigator’s Brochure for 
additional information).  
 
Management:  includes epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], volume resuscitation, and corticosteroids, and other supportive 
care as needed (oxygen, ventilation, beta2 agonists for bronchoconstriction, etc.). Management is 
generally similar to that described for cytokine release syndrome (as above), but with the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_614152]. The dose of epi[INVESTIGATOR_614153] (low dose for hypotension, high dose -1 mg iv repeated every minute 
as necessary) for PEA arrest, according to ACLS guidelines.  
 
Pulmonary Toxicity  
Given experience in this trial and in a related trial of huCART -meso cells in patients with ovarian cancer, 
mesothelioma, and lung cancer, ALI/ARDS may occur secondary to direct activity of the huCART -meso 
cells on mesothelin -expressing type I pneumocytes, first pass effect, and/or initiation of an organ -specific 
immu ne reaction. Given these adverse events, subjects will be admitted for the huCART- meso infusion 
and remain inpatient for observation for [ADDRESS_814446] will be admitted to an inpatient unit for further evaluation and care.

Management :  In add ition to standard and research laboratory tests being drawn, a cytokine panel 
will be drawn and processed as quickly as possible to ascertain if an actionable pathway (e.g. IL -6 
treatment with tocilizumab) is activated. Should the subject develop increasing respi[INVESTIGATOR_614154] a cytokine release syndrome, the subject will 
be transferred to the medical intensive care unit and treated with tocilizumab per protocol. Subsequent doses of tocilizumab will be administe red as dictated by [CONTACT_614220]. Should the subject develop increasing respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], standard supportive care measures for hypoxia will be initiated, including increasing oxygen delivery as indicated to maintain adequate oxygenation and/or utilizing non -invasive or invasive ventilation 
support if clinically indicated. Should the subject fail to respond to these supportive measures and tocilizumab dosing as manifest by [CONTACT_614221][INVESTIGATOR_1399], consideration to lympholytic cyclophosphamide doses to abrogate all huCART -meso activity would be 
made in consultation with the critical care team.  
 
Neurologic Toxicity  
Guidelines for management of neurologic toxicity are described in Table 9.4-1. The mechanism underlying 
neurotoxicity after CAR T cell administration is poorly understood. Anecdotal evidence suggests that anti-IL6 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which are effective for CRS, do not reverse neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity can be asynchronous with cytokine release syndrome, often reaching its maximum intensity later than CRS or even arising after resolution of CRS. This has led to the appearance in some cases that treatment of CRS with anti -IL6 ag ents worsens or precipi[INVESTIGATOR_614155]; a causative relationship between anti -IL6 
therapy and neurotoxicity has not been conclusively established, however, and severe neurotoxicity has been observed in the absence of CRS and in cases where no anti -IL6 therapy has been used. The following 
principles guide the recommended management of neurotoxicity:  
– Most instances of neurologic toxicity are self-limited, but life -threatening complications such 
as cerebral edema develop in some cases. Corticosteroid therapy aimed at dampening CAR T cell proliferation and activity is therefore recommended for moderate (Grade 2 -3) 
neurotoxicity with the objective of preventing development of life- threatening, Grade [ADDRESS_814447] CAR T cell efficacy. The recommended dose of corticosteroids is therefore stratified based on perceived risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_614156] -threatening complications; low/moderate 
doses are recommended for Grade 2, moderate doses for Grade 3, and high -doses for Grade 
4. In addition, it is recommended that cytotoxic chemotherapy be considered in Grade 4 cases 
based on a report that cerebral edema improved promptly after cyclophosphamide 
chemotherapy in one case (Garfall et al. 2016 ). 
– Consultation with a neurologist is helpful for properly documenting and tracking neurologic abnormalities, evaluating for other potential etiologies of neurologic abnormalities, and managing neurologic emergencies such as seizure or elevated intracranial pressure.  
– Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia should be aggressively managed. Both coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia often develop with CRS. Intracranial hemorrhage has been observed in conjunction with severe neurotoxicity. Intracranial hemorrhage may provide a portal of entry for CAR T cells and systemic cytokines to affect the CNS or may simply confound interpretation of neurologic abnormalities. In addition, a recent report suggests that thrombocytopenia is an 
independent risk factor for CAR -related neurotoxicity, and platelets may serve as a source of 
mediators that stabilize the endothelium and counteract destabilizing effects of cytokines 
elaborated during CAR T cell proliferation (Gust et al. 2017 ).

• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disc lose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI  
 
In the event that the subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study

It is recommended that the patient have an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥500/µl, prior to undergoing apheresis.  If the patient’s ALC is <500/µl, it is 
recommended that a lymphocyte subset analysis (CD3, CD4, CD8 counts) be performed to confirm that the patient has an absolute CD3 count of ≥150/µl.  If the 
absolute CD3 count is <150/µl, it is recommended that the leukapheresis procedure be delayed until their ALC is ≥500/µl  or absolute CD3 count is ≥150/µl.  Up 
to a 4 -week delay may occur; following this, further discussion is needed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_614164].   
13. Performed at Months [ADDRESS_814463] be performed within 48 hours prior to the huCART -meso infusion.  If already performed within 
this window, these laboratory tests do not need to be repeated on Day 0.  
17. A baseline tumor biopsy will be performed prior to huCART -meso infusion  (and cyclophosphamide administration if applicable) , if the subject has an accessible 
tumor . The baseline biopsy may occur any time prior to infusion between Day -14 to Day -1.  This baseline biopsy sample will  be used to evaluate the level of 
mesothelin expression (using GeoMx Digital Profiling analysis; for exploratory purposes only) and if feasible, other immune markers at baseline.   If a subject does 
not have an accessible tumor or a biopsy is not felt to be  clinically appropriate, an archived tumor tissue specimen may be obtained for research purposes.   Please 
refer to the Tissue Handling Manual for complete details.  
18. Collection of adverse events will begin at the time of initiation of study treatment (lympho depleting chemotherapy or huCART -meso cell infusion depending on 
cohort assignment).  Cohort 5 Participants (Effective Protocol Amendment V11) Only: At the time alternative therapy for their disease is initiated, subjects will 
only be followed for protocol -defined adverse events (PDAES) as defined in Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_814464]

19. INR at screening only  
20. Physical examination to include a visual examination of the throat. If toxicity is suspected, please consult with a Pulmonolo gy Study Investigator.  
21. Tumor biopsy to be performed at Day 14 (±7  days).  This biopsy sample will be used to evaluate the level of mesothelin expression (using GeoMx Digital Profiling 
analysis; for exploratory purposes only) and if feasible, other immune markers. Please refer to the Laboratory Manual for complete details.  
22. Only ferritin  and CRP  required ; other labs repeated as clinically indicated . 
23. For suspected brain metastasis (performed within 8 weeks of eligibility confirmation by a physician -investigator ).   
24. Baseline scans should be obtained within 28 days prior to infusion of huCART -meso cells and after any can cer therapy administered between collection and 
huCART -meso infusion.  In applicable cohorts, baseline scans should also be obtained prior to cyclophosphamide administration.  
25. Viral serologies:  HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B surface antibody, Hepatitis B core antibody, and HIV Hepatitis C antibody. If the HCV 
antibody is positive, a screening HCV RNA by [CONTACT_379217] -PCR or bDNA assay must be performed. Eligibility will be determined b ased on the screening value. The test 
is not required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60 days prior to screening is provid ed.

Additional scans may be performed as clinically appropriate.  Scans may be performed with or without contrast. At the screeni ng visit, a CT performed within [ADDRESS_814471] -huCART -meso infusion if CRS is suspected, or as clinically indicated. 
7. Blood draw before infusion and ~[ADDRESS_814472]’s veins are not adequate for apheresis procedure, the subject may hav e a central venous apheresis catheter  line placed by [CONTACT_12387].  
It is recommended that the patient have an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥500/µl, prior to undergoing apheresis.  If the patient’s ALC is <500/µl, it is 
recommended that a ly mphocyte subset analysis (CD3, CD4, CD8 counts) be performed to confirm that the patient has an absolute CD3 count of ≥150/µl .  If the 
absolute CD3 count is <150/µl, it is recommended that the leukapheresis procedure be delayed until their ALC is ≥500/µl or absolute CD3 count is ≥150/µl.  Up 
to a 4 -week delay may occur; following this, further discussion is needed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_614164].   
13. Performed at Months [ADDRESS_814473] their tumor for mesothelin expression.  Evaluation of 
mesothelin expression will occur on archived tumor tissue,  if the patient has not had an anti -mesotheli n directed therapy since the collection of the archived 
sample .  However if archived tumor tissue is not available, a biopsy may be performed. If the mesothelin expression of the subjects ’ tumor is known prior to 
signing the pre-screening  consent for this study, the results of this testing will need to be confirmed as part of the subjects’ participation on this protocol.  If a 
fresh biopsy is performed to evaluate mesothelin expression, samples will also be collected for research analysis.  Please refer to t he Tissue Handling Manual for 
additional information.  Once mesothelin expression has been confirmed, subjects may proceed to the next step and be presented the main informed conse nt 
for the study.  
17. A baseline tumor biopsy will be performed prior to huCART -meso infusion  (and cyclophosphamide administration if applicable) , if the subject has an accessible 
tumor. The baseline biopsy may occur any time prior to infusion between Day -[ADDRESS_814474] had a fresh biopsy at pre -screening in order to evaluate mesothelin

25. Viral serologies:  HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B surface antibody, Hepatitis B core antibody, and HIV Hepatitis C antibo dy. If the HCV 
antibody is positive, a screening HCV RNA by [CONTACT_379217] -PCR or bDNA assay must be  performed. Eligibility will be determined based on the screening value. The test 
is not required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60 days prior to screening is provid ed. 
26. Additional infusions may be performed within a +3 week window from the targeted infusion days [Day 21 (+ 3 weeks) and Day 42 (+3 weeks)].  Given the allowable 
window for these additional infusions,  the timing of post -infusion safety follow -up visits will be dependent on the  actual  timing of the additional huCART -meso 
infusion s.  In summary, the  timing of the post -infusion safety follow -up visits will be calculated as the actual study day they occurred post  Infusion #2 and Infusion 
#3 (i.e. + [ADDRESS_814476] Infusion #2, +[ADDRESS_814477] Infusion #2, +[ADDRESS_814478] Infusion #3, etc.).  This should be recorded as the actual study day, even if an assessment 
falls within the allowable visit window.  In addition , the study day from Day 0 ( the initial huCART -meso infusion) must also be captured.  Example: Infusion # + 
Study Visit Day Post Infusion/Study Visit Day from Day 0 = Infusion #2 Day +6/Day 28.  Please refer to Section 6.8.3 for complete details. If an infusion is omitted, 
these safety follow- up visits will not be required. If an infusion is delayed, these additional safety follow -up visits will be shifted to align with the timing of the 
infusion.   
27. A mini -apheresis procedure (~5 L) will also be performed for research purposes at Day +21 (+/- 7 days) after the 3rd huCART -meso infusion (or the last huCART -

41. Subjects will first be asked to sign a pre -screening consent to collect information from their medical history and to test their tumor for mesothelin expression. 
Once mesothelin expression has been confirmed, subjects may be presented the main informed consent for the study.   
42. If the additional huCART -meso infusions are delayed by [CONTACT_7809] 7 days, or not performed for any reason, the additional infusion study visits [at Day 21 and 
Day 42] will still be performed as scheduled, however they wil l be repurposed as a safety follow -up visit only. These safety follow -up visits will be identified as 
the actual study visit day from Day 0 (i.e. Day 26) and should be performed within +7 days of the planned study timepoint. If  the additional huCART -meso i nfusions 
are then subsequently performed within the protocol allowable window (+3 weeks), the actual infusion day will be calculated as the actual study visit day from Day 0 (i.e. Day 35) and the study visit assessments required for an infusion visit will be repeated prior to the infusion .

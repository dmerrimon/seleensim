 Zoledronic Acid to Prevent High -Turnover Bone Loss after Bariatric  Surgery  
 
I. Background and significance  
 
Bariatric surgery is a highly effective and sustainable method for weight loss  [1]. Roux -en-Y 
Gastric by[CONTACT_6476] (RYGB)  and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the most common bariatric procedures  
perfor med worldwide , encompassing >85% of all bariatric procedures performed worldwide  [2]. 
Sleeve gastrectomy was introduced within the past decade and has seen an explosion in 
popularity, now comprising 61% of all bariatric procedures performed at academic medical 
centers  [3].  Although  both surgeries  lead to dramatic benefits in obesity and obesity -related 
comorbidities, they are associated with large magnitude bone loss.  We have previously 
documented bone mineral density (BMD) declines on the order of 10% within the first 2 years 
after RYGB  [4, 5]  and 5% within the first year after SG [6]. Another study has shown similar 
rates of bone loss between RYGB and SG procedures in the first 2 years after surgery [7]. 
Postmenopausal women appear to be at particular risk for a higher rate of bone loss after RYGB 
than younger women  [8, 9] . Furthermore, we have documented parallel deterioration in 
peripheral bone microarchit ecture,  with increases in cortical porosity and endocortical resorption, 
and decreases in trabecular nu mber and density  [5, 9] . By 2 years after RYGB, the declines in 
BMD and microarchitecture translated into a 9 -10% drop in estimated bone strength at the radius 
and tib ia, as assessed by [CONTACT_84798] -finite element analysis.  SG has increased in popularity only in 
recent years and there have not been many studies of changes in skeletal outcomes to date.  
 
We have recently demonstrated that RYGB confers a 43% increased risk of nonvertebral 
fractures  [10]. The higher rate of RYGB -associated fractures was specifically observed for hip 
fractures and wrist fractures relative to adjustable gastric banding (AGB), a bariatric procedure 
that is thought to have a relatively neutral effect on bone  [11-13]. Another  study confirmed that 
RYGB patients have a 3 -5 fold higher incidence of hip, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and humerus fractures compared 
to community fracture rates  [14]. Currently there are insufficient data to determine whether SG 
leads to increased fracture risk [15]. 
 
We have performed several studies demonstrating the timing and pattern of rise in bone turnover 
markers after RYGB. Most notably, C -telopeptide (CTX), a marker of bone resorption, increases 
as early as postoperative day 10 and peaks at 6 months after surgery, at a range that is 220 -245% 
above baseline values  [5, 12, 16] . This marked elevation in bone resorption far exceeds the 
increases in bone resorption that occur in the settings of non -surgical weight loss, men opausal 
transition, or immobilizati on due to [ADDRESS_893757]  [17-19]. Longitudinal studies have also noted 
persistently increased bone resorption in the initial years after RYGB  [13, 20, 21] , with one 
recent study reporting CTX elevations of 14 0% up to 5 years after RYGB  [22]. Several studies 
have also shown significant increases in CTX up to 5 years after SG, though possibly  to a lesser 
extent than  after RYGB [6, 7, 23] . 
 
Currently there are no effective methods to prevent bone loss in bariatric surgery patients, with 
studies -to-date focused on non -pharmacologic tr eatments . The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_662302] a pharmacologic agent for the prevention of RYGB - and SG -induced high -turnover 
bone loss.  Intravenous zoledronic acid is ideally suited to prevent the clinically relevant high-
turnover bone loss associated with  these surgeries . FDA -approved zoledronic acid is a potent 
3 
 antiresorptive that significantly reduces spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hip, and nonvertebral fracture  risk in osteoporosis  
[24], and leads to normalization of bone resorption in high -turnover bone disorders, such as 
Paget’s disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and induced hypogonadism  [25-29]. A single 
dose of zoledronic acid can achieve persistent suppression of bone turnover markers and 
improvements in bone density for 5 years  [30], as well as remissions of Paget’s disease for over 
5 years  [31]. There are currently no studies of the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid to 
prevent  bariatric surgery - induced bone loss.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_662303] a potent anti -resorptive agent can block the powerful 
increases in bone resorption that are otherwise observed after RYGB  and SG .  
 
II. Specific Aims  
 
Our overall aim is to  inhibit high bone turnover, prevent bone loss,  and ultimately reduce 
fracture risk in at -risk adults undergoing RYGB  or SG . We hypothesize that zoledronic acid can 
be used safely for this purpose.  
 
Aim 1  
Our aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative zoledronic acid treatment on bone  
turnover in postmenopausal women and older men undergoing RYGB or SG . We will examine 
6-month postoperative changes in serum CTX and P1NP, markers of bone turnover, after a 
preoperative infusion of zoledronic acid in an open -label fashion . We will also em ploy and refine 
a perioperative protocol of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, with serial monitoring of 
serum calcium levels.  
Hypothesis : Zoledronic acid safely and effectively inhibits the increases in CTX and 
P1NP after RYGB  and SG . 
 
Aim 2  
Our aim is to assess early changes in bone density, and estimated bone strength after 
preoperative zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women and older men undergoing RYGB or SG . 
We will utilize dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomogra phy 
(QCT) to  preliminarily assess skeletal changes 6 months after RYGB and SG.  
Hypothesis : Zoledronic acid attenuates early RYGB - and SG-induced bone loss   
 
 
III. Subject Selection

Study subjects will be recruited from the MGH Weight Center , and if necessary the Brigham and 
Women ’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662305] (PWM) . Briefly, we will advertise the 
study  using IRB approved  materials within [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) and the 
MGH Weight Center . Recruitment flyers will be posted in approved locations throughout the 
MGH (including the MGH Weight Center) and email announcements will be sent through the 
Partners Clinical Research Program Network.  Potential subjects may be identified by [CONTACT_662321] C enter surgical scheduling 
calendar. These subjects will be sent a letter to introduce the study that is co -signed by [CONTACT_662322]. A member of the study staff who is not the treating physician 
will also explain the study to pot ential bariatric surgical subjects at a pre -operative visit.  With

the study. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662306], and these s ubjects will sign an additional short -form  as well as the primary 
consent form. Subjects will be given a copy of their signed consent form and an additional copy 
will be kept in our research files.   
 
Subjects will receive $200  compensation for participating in the study, as well as a parking 
vouch er for each visit or transportation compensation up to $20.  
 
 
V. Study Procedures  
 
 
[ADDRESS_893762] laboratory testing, skeletal evaluation (DXA, QCT ), and 
study drug infusion . Subjects will also be asked questions about t heir medical history. All study 
subjects will receive [ADDRESS_893763] occurs within 7 days of zoledronic 
acid administration  [32, 33] , the study drug will be administered more than [ADDRESS_893764] be administered as an infusion over no less than 15 minutes.  
Subjects will be advised to ensure proper hydration prior to receiving study drug, and those 
without a contraindication to acetaminophen will be provided with acetaminophen 650 mg PO at 
the time of infusion.   
 
 Participants will receive personalized nutri tional (calcium/vitamin D ) counseling  throughout the 
study to ensure compliance with guidelines for the postoperative management of bariat ric 
surgery patients  [34]. A nutritionist will ensure pre -operative intake of at least 1500 mg/day of 
calcium th rough combination of diet and calcium supplements  and at least 3000  IU/day of 
vitamin D . Postoperatively, study subjects will be instructed to take supplemental calcium citrate 
1000  mg/day in divided doses as well as vitamin D 3000 IU/day. Subjects will be  advised of 
bariatric formulations of calcium citrate and vitamin D that are chewable, liquid, or quick -
dissolve. Furthermore, most RYGB and SG patients at our institution are prescribed a 
standardized postoperative diet plan that includes ~ [ADDRESS_893765] -operative intake  (through diet and supplements)  of at least 1500 mg/day of 
calcium and 3000IU/day of vitamin D, in accordance with guidelines for the postoperative 
managemen t of bariatric surgery patients [34]. Calcium and vitamin D supplements will be 
provided for all subjects  who do not meet th ese optimal intake levels. 
 
Additional study visits will occur at post -operative weeks 2, 12, and 24 and will include 
assessments for safety and skeletal outcomes.  A skeletal evaluation (DXA, QCT) will again be 

[ADDRESS_893766] protocol to 
escalate calcium/D supplements (see Monitoring and Quality Assurance below).  An independent 
Data Safety Monitori ng Board will review study progress and any  adverse events.  This study has 
been granted IND -exempt status by [CONTACT_1622].  This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov under 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  
 
The following data will be collected:  
1. DXA measurements of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck, and total body  at 
baseline and [ADDRESS_893767] ivity 
 
Technical Methods  
 
DXA  
Dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scans of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, femoral neck, and 
total body will be obtained at baseline and 6 -month visits (QDR Discovery, Hologic, Inc, 
Bedford, MA). These scans will be used to assess areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The short -
term precision f or this technique is 1 -2% at the MGH Bone Density Center.  The effective 
absorbed radiation dose for eac h set of DXA scans is 0.[ADDRESS_893768]  
Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L2) will be obtained at 
baseline and 6 -month vi sits (GE LightSpeed Pro CT scanner, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). 
These scans will be used to assess volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD). Scans are 
performed with helical acquisition, 1.25mm slice thickness, QCTPro calibration phantom, and 
the following  settings: L1 -L2 (120 kvP, 100 mA). 3D reconstructive analysis for volumetric 
bone density for integral, trabecular and cortical compartments will be performed on QCTPro 
software (Mindways Software, Inc., Austin, TX). The short -term precision for this tech nique is 
1-2% for vertebral BMD measurements .[35-37] The effective absorbed rad iation dose for e ach 
set of scans is 1.[ADDRESS_893769] will assess calcium and vitamin D intake using a validated food frequency 
questionnaire [38] and will  provide personalized nutritional counseling . Physical activity will be 
assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long format .[39] A self -
administered questi onnaire will assess medical history, including fracture history and medication 
use. 
 
Bone Turnover Markers  
Fasting morning blood will be collected at each visit. Serum levels of type 1 cross -linked C -
telopeptide (CTX) will be measured by [CONTACT_6428] (Nordic Bioscience, Denmark), with intra - and 
interassay CV of 1.8% and 2.5%. Serum levels of procollagen type 1 N -terminal propeptide  
(P1NP) will be measured by [CONTACT_69727] (Orion Diagnostica, Finland), with intra - and interassay CV of 
6.5% and 6.0%. We will also  measure serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin D (LC/MS) and PTH (Nichols 
Institute Diagnostics, San Clemente, CA).  
 
Safety Measures  
Serum calcium and albumin will be measured at each visit. Study subjects will also be assessed 
for hypocalcemic signs and symptoms. Hypo calcemia, if detected, will be graded according to 
common terminology for adverse  event criteria (CTCAE v.4) ,[40] with particular attention to 
symptomatic hypocalcemia and/or grade 2 -4 hypocalcemia (<8.0 mg/dL).  Hypocalcemia will be 
addressed with application of an algorithm (see “Data Safety and Monitoring” section below).  
 
 
VI. Biostatistical Analysis  
 
All analyses will assess the distribution variables, and where appropriate, will employ 
transformation to combat skew or other irregularities. In addition to asse ssing study feasibility, 
the primary outcome of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_662307] [ADDRESS_893770] intercepts  and fixed time (0, 2, 12, and 24 weeks)  effects.  
Exploratory outcomes  include changes in bone density over the 6 -month p eriod , which will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_662326] t-tests. As a safety measure, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_662308] . All analyses will be performed using SAS 9.2 
software  (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  
 
The primary purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_662309] a larger, 
statistically powered randomized controlled trial.  As such, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_662310]. 
 
 
VII. Risks and Discomforts  
 
Zoledronic Acid  
The most common side effects associated with zoledronic acid include flu -like symptoms (e.g., 
fever, chills,  muscle/joint aches) occurring after the infusion. The majority of these symptoms 
[ADDRESS_893771] 3 days following drug administration and usually resolve  within 3 days of 
onset but resolution can take up to 7 -14 days. Taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen after the 
infusion can mitigate these symptoms. Other common side  effects include nausea, ti redness, 
dizziness, headache, or pain/redness/swelling at the injection site.  
 
Hypocalcemi a 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_662311] (n=7736), 
approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels to values less than 
7.5 mg/dL within 11 days after zoledronic acid administration  [41]. No symptomatic cases of 
hypocalcemia were observed. It is possible that RYGB patients may be  more susceptible to  
developi[INVESTIGATOR_662312] [16, 42] . The incidence of 
postoperative hypocalcemia (<8 .9 mg/dl) after RYGB is 1 -2% and is associated with pre -existing 
renal insufficiency and vitamin D defici ency [43, 44] . Study subjects in this trial will be 
excluded for renal insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency, as well as for low serum calcium or 
magnesium, or use of loop diuretics.  All  study  subjects will receive ergocalciferol 50,000 IU for 
3 days prior to study drug infusion , and will also receive personalized counseling about calcium 
and vitamin D intake throughout the study. We will monitor s erum calcium and 25 -
hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) as per our research protocol.  
 
Risk of ergocalciferol  
There is a very small risk that the ergocalciferol supplement could cause vitamin D toxicity.  This 
is unlikely to be an issue for the dose used in this study . 
 
Calcium and vitamin D supplements  
The MGH Weight Center  recommends  that all RYGB and SG patients take supplemental 
calcium and vitamin D.  These supplements will be provided to study subjects during their 
participation in the trial.  In the doses used i n this study, calcium and vitamin D have minimal 
side effects.   Some individuals may note constipation or stomach u pset with calcium 
supplements.  Very rarely, if an individual is over -supplemented with calcium, a kidney stone 
could result.  
 
Acetaminophen:   Acetaminophen is very safe when used appropriately.  A single standard dose 
will be administered at the time of study drug infusion to decrease the likelihood of acute phase 
response . Overdose of acetaminophen may be hepatotoxic. The single dose of acetaminophen at 
the time of study drug infusion will be withheld if a subject has known significant liver disease , 
reports that a clinician has ever advised avoidance of acetaminophen, or otherwise reports a 
sensitivity to acetaminophen .  An exclusion criterion for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_662313] > 2x the upper limit of normal.   
 
Renal toxicity  
Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment and in rare cases, acute renal  failure. 
There is a transient increase  in serum creatinine within 10 days of dosing in 1.8% of zoledronic -
acid treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo -treated patients. Renal function will be monitored 
closely throughout  the study and patients will be required to have an estimated GFR >35  
(mL/ min) to receive zoledronic acid.  
[ADDRESS_893772] any  
major den tal work planned during the projected course of the study (extractions or implants).  
 
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_662314], low -energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been  reported in 
bisphosphonate -treated patients. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_11280] s may be unilateral or bilateral and some  
patients report prodromal dull or aching pain in the thigh in the weeks to months before a 
complete fracture  occurs. The incidence of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_662315] -defined but 
appears to be extremely rare an d at least somewhat dose -dependent. If a study subject presents 
with thigh or groin pain, she/he will be  immediately evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur 
fracture.  
 
Imaging studies  
Over the [ADDRESS_893773] scans  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] . One set of scans will be performed at the baseline visit, 
and the second set of scans will be performed at the 6 -month visit.  The overall total dose for the 
entire study is ~3.[ADDRESS_893774] of 1996 per federal law and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361]. The consent form describes what 
protected health information from the research study may be used or shared with others. Data 
collected strictly for researc h purposes are stored in locked files and on computers with 
passwords required for access.  Data will be entered into the Partners -approved secure REDCap 
database system.  When the data are published, no names or other materials that allow 
identification of an individual will be used . 
 
11 
 Study physicians and staff will monitor subjects closely. Routine safety measures (e.g. renal 
function, calcium levels ) will be assessed as described in the research plan and reviewed by a 
physician in real -time. The study phys icians and the study staff will also meet on a weekly basis 
to discuss any issues relating to adverse events, safety data and outcome data. At the discretion 
of the study physician, any laboratory or physical exam abnormalities can be cause for 
discontinua tion. If a subject experiences an adverse event, we will ensure necessary medical 
treatment and will provide that treatment, free of cost if necessary, within our institution.  
 
Although rates of hypocalcemia are rare in osteoporosis studies, RYGB and SG patients might 
be at greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_662316]. Nevertheless, we 
expect these risks to be small. All study subjects will be required to have normal serum calcium, 
magnesium, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D, and renal functio n at study entry. Patients taking loop 
diuretics will be excluded due to increased risk of hypocalcemia with zoledron ic acid with 
concomitant use . 
 
In addition to the precautions  being taken with all study subjects , postoperative serum  
chemistries  will be monitored closely at multiple timepoints as described below:  
 
Postoperative  serum  calcium  and 25OHD  levels  will be monitored  closely  at 2-week , 12-week , 
and 6-month  timepoints , as indicated  in the research  protocol .   
• Laboratory results obtained during the  follow -up visits will be approached according to the 
following algorithm:  
 
• Serum  25OHD  < 30 ng/mL with corrected  serum  calcium  within  normal  range :  
▪ Serum  25OHD  20-30 ng/dL: increase  vitamin  D intake  by 2000 IU 
▪ Serum  25OHD  < 20 ng/dL: increase  vitamin  D intake  by 2000 IU daily  and add 
ergocalciferol  50,000 IU three  times  weekly  for 3 weeks    
 
• Hypocalcemia:  
▪ Grade 1, corrected calcium 8.0 -8.4 mg/dL:  
o if without symptoms and if vitamin D is to be increased in response to 
25OHD level (see a bove), no additional treatment beyond the increase in 
vitamin D supplement; repeat serum calcium in 1 week and increase total 
daily calcium intake by 500 mg (up to a maximum daily intake of 2500 
mg/day) if still ≤ 8.4 mg/dL  
o if symptomatic or if 25OHD level  already at goal of 30 ng/mL, increase 
total daily calcium intake by 500 mg (up to a maximum daily intake of 
2500 mg/day); repeat serum calcium in 1 week  
▪ Grade 2, corrected calcium 7.0 -7.9 mg/dL:  
o if without symptoms and if vitamin D is to be increased in response to 
25OHD level (see above), increase total daily calcium intake by 500 mg 
(up to a maximum daily intake of 2500 mg/day) and increase vitamin D 
supplement as above; repeat serum calcium in 1 week  
o if symptomatic or if 25OHD level already at goal of 30 ng/mL or if 
already at maximum daily calcium intake, also add calcitriol 0.25 mcg 
12 
 once daily (if 7.5 -7.9 mg/dL) or twice daily (if 7.0 -7.4 mg/dL); repeat 
serum calcium in 1 week  
▪ If corrected calcium still <8.0 mg/dL at 1 -week recheck, increase 
calcitrio l by 0.25 mcg daily and repeat  
▪ Grade 3 (corrected calcium 6.0 -6.9 mg/dL) or grade 4 (corrected calcium <6.0 
mg/dl or severe symptoms): refer to physician for IV calcium and other ev aluation 
and treatment  
 
Finally, renal function will be monitored closely a nd patients are required to have an estimated 
GFR >35 (mL/min) to receive study drug. Additionally, no subject will be enrolled if they have 
any major dental work planned during the course of the study, and all subject complaints of thigh 
or groin pain wil l be immediately evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. The risks 
of phlebotomy will be minimized by [CONTACT_662327].  
 
In addition, a Data Safety Monitoring Board will be appointed. This DSMB will be comprised of 
2 physicians, neither of whom are involved in the trial. This DSMB will be responsible for 
ensuring scientific integrity and protecting the safety of study subjects. Specifically, the DSMB 
will meet every 6 months to review all the safety data including chan ges in primary and safety 
endpoints. The DSMB has access to unblinded data and the authority to perform more formal 
interim analyses should there be a suggestion of increased adverse events occurring in either 
treated group. The DSMB has the authority to r ecommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_662317]. The DSMB also reviews investigator and study staff performance 
(recruitment, retention, flow of data forms, protocol adherence, and data quality).  
 
Unanticipated problems will be reported to the PHRC IRB within 7 days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_662318]. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (regardless of expectedness, 
relatedness, or if they meet the definition for unanticipated problems) will be reported to the IRB 
within 48 hours of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_504615]. The report will include a description 
of the event, as well as the Investigator’s assessment of expectedness, relatedness and other 
information, as relevant.  Any action taken by [CONTACT_662328] m should be provided in the 
report. The DSMB will be provided with this information but will provide an independent 
assessment on attribution and expectedness, as well as whether further action is recommended 
(e.g. collection of follow up information).  In  the event of a discrepancy between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_662319] “unanticipated”, the determination of the 
DSMB will be considered final.

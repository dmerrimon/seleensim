SECTION  I: RESEARCH  PLAN
1.Statement  of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  
We hypothesize that Guanfacine (GUA) (3mg/day) will reduce drug craving, improve cognitive flexibility and 
result in associated  lower drug use in women with substance  use disorder (SUD) in an outpatient clinical 
setting. This study proposes to extend our previous  Phase  I experimental  work to address the following 
specific aims: (1) assess  GUA’s target engagement  of drug  craving  and cognitive  flexibility in a laboratory  
challenge session and in a 10-week outpatient clinical study,  (2) demonstrate target  validation by [CONTACT_734053] 
10-week clinical  trial in SUD women, and finally, (3) evaluate data replication and scalability of GUA target  
effects across  two clinical sites (Yale and SUNY-Stony  Brook).  
2.Probable Duration  of Project: State the expected duration of the project,  including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
3 years  followed  by 2-years  data analysis
3.Background: Describe  the background information  that led to the plan for this project.  Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Growing basic evidence indicates that the alpha-[ADDRESS_1003034],  guanfacine (GUA) decreases drug-
related striatal-limbic  up-regulation and stress sensitization resulting in drug cue and stress-induced  
reinstatement in laboratory  animals (Shaham and Hope, 2005),  and also improves neurocognitive abilities 
such as attention, flexibility, working memory  and decision making (Arnsten, 2009). In NIDA-supported 
medications development work (R01-DA027130,  PI: [CONTACT_138196]), we identified in a 3-day inpatient laboratory  
controlled experiment that GUA at 3mg/day dose engaged target drug craving and cognitive flexibility 
processes, and more importantly, that GUA engaged these key processes  in a sex-specific  manner  with

Page  2 of 24positive effects in women  but not in men (Fox et al., 2012; Sinha  et al., 2011).  Preliminary data also showed 
that GUA 3 mg/day (bid dosing) vs. placebo  led to higher cocaine-negative urines  in an 8-week outpatient 
setting only  in women and not men. 
4.Research Plan: Summarize the study  design and research  procedures  using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood  by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits  specifying  their individual  times  and 
lengths.  Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
The current study will test GUA (3 mg/day) vs Placebo (PBO) in a 10-week clinical  trial across [ADDRESS_1003035]  cognitive behavioral relapse prevention with medication management and 
contingency management (CM) for treatment  attendance. A 5-day taper will be implemented  in week 10. All 
participants will also take  part in two laboratory challenge test sessions : one at pre-treatment  (pre-tx)  and 
one during week 9 of treatment, to assess provoked drug craving and cognitive flexibility under stress,  drug 
cue and neutral cue conditions in a randomized and counterbalanced order.
Pre-treatment Intake Procedures:  Following  the initial  telephone screening, eligible participants  will meet  
with the research staff to obtain  written informed consent. Subjects will complete 2-[ADDRESS_1003036] will also be 
completed. All subjects will meet with  the study physician,  and if deemed eligible, after discussion of risk and 
benefits, subjects  will be randomized into the study.  
Randomization: Eligible subjects will then be randomized in a double blind manner to either  placebo or 3 
mg/day (bid dosing)  of GUA balancing the patients on age, education, race, ADHD  and severity of drug use.
Medication Titration Period (wk 1-3):  Following a 3-day abstinence  period,  a 2-week titration period, 
previously found to be safe and with only mild adverse effects (Fox et al., 2014; Fox et al., 2012;  Milivojevic et 
al., 2017) will be initiated (see Table 1). 
Table 1: Dose Titration Schedule
 
Steady state period (wk 3-9 & medication taper (wk 10): Following  titration,  participants  will continue taking 
medication as shown  in Table  1 for seven  weeks and with  a 5-day taper  in week 10 as used previously (Fox et 
al., 2012) and complete post treatment assessments.  We have had no adverse  events  of medication B.I.D  Dose

Discontinuation or dose adjustment due to side effects : While we anticipate  subjects  will tolerate study 
medication well, should  participants experience side effects attributable to medication, titration will be 
stopped at the highest tolerable dose. Our previous studies  indicated that 3mg/day  was tolerable with  
adverse events rated as minimal or mild. 
Medication compliance: Medication compliance will be assessed in multiple ways:  1) We will include 2X/daily  
cell/home phone prompts as a reminder to take study medication. This strategy has been successfully  
implemented in previous addiction trials (Kranzler et al., 2004);  (Simpson et al., 2005). If a subject does  not 
have a phone, a prepaid  phone will be provided for the duration of the trial. 2) A riboflavin marker will be 
included in study medication  and urines will be assessed  by [CONTACT_734054]. 3) We will assess GUA levels  as in our previous study  at week  3, 6 and 9. 
Importantly, we will explore the relationship between compliance and cocaine use outcomes. 
Laboratory Challenge  Component: An identical laboratory challenge session will be conducted  in the initial  
week of outpatient treatment Week  0, prior to medication, and again  in Week 9.  Our standard imagery  script  
development procedures will be used to develop the stress, drug cue and neutral relaxing  imagery  scripts. 
The stress imagery  script will be based  on participants’ description  of a recent personal  event  experienced as 
"most stressful", and determined  as such by [CONTACT_734055] [ADDRESS_1003037] or job-related stress. A drug cue script will be developed 
based on situations involving  people places and things pertaining to drug use that led to wanting drug and 
eventual drug use (e.g.,  meeting drug using  friend, going  by a favorite bar, etc). The neutral  script  will be 
developed from a personal non-alcohol-related relaxing situation. A 5-minute ‘script’ of each  scenario will be 
written using Scene  Construction Questionnaires (Sinha,  2009) where verbal  and non-verbal responses, and 
physiological and bodily sensations regarding the events will be obtained. A script  is then  written following 
standard format and content procedures and scripts are then recorded onto audiotape for guided imagery in 
the laboratory  sessions  (Sinha, 2009) . On the morning of the day prior to the initial laboratory  session, 
participants will be brought into the testing room to receive training in relaxation and imagery  procedures, as 
well as familiarize themselves with  the subjective rating forms. The 10-min relaxation training will comprise 
muscle relaxation procedures in order  to help subjects reach a relaxed state  prior to imagery exposure during 
the laboratory  sessions. 
The schedule of the laboratory challenge tests at pre-treatment in Week  [ADDRESS_1003038] over 2-hours  in one afternoon, and comprise exposure to 3, 
5-minute personalized  imagery  conditions  (stress, neutral, drug cue), presented in a randomized and 
counterbalanced order. In each case,  all participants  will be brought into the testing room at 2:45  PM. If 
needed, a smoke  break  will be given to control for nicotine  withdrawal.  An ambulatory EKG (Holter) monitor  
will be used  to record  vitals  and heart rate variability (HRV).   After  10 minutes relaxation,  drug  craving, 
anxiety, mood, HRV and saliva will be collected at -10 and -5 minutes  prior to imagery  exposure.  Subjects will 
then be given headphones and asked  to imagine the situation  being described,  'as if' they were actively  
participating in it at that moment. The script  will be presented for exactly  5 minutes. All measures  will be 
collected again immediately following imagery (0) and at +15 and +[ADDRESS_1003039] 10 minutes of relaxation in 
between each of the three imagery sessions. All saliva will be placed on ice immediately, prior  to storing at -
80. Relaxation  instructions will be provided following  exposure  to all three  imagery conditions in order to 
ameliorate any potential  residual effects of stress. All staff and participants will be blind to the order of 
imagery presentation.  Imagery script development, imagery training and relaxation  techniques will be

Study Assessments: Assessments include the following:  
1) Sample description  and eligibility including sociodemographics; psychosocial, substance use, and medical  
history; psychiatric assessment  using the:
i) Structured Clinical  Interview of Diagnostics  (SCID-I) for DSM-V,(First et al., 1995) , 
ii) Connors ADHD Assessment and Rating Scale  (CAARS,(Conners,  1999)
iii) vitals
iv) CBC, blood chemistry
v) urinalysis 
v) pregnancy testing;  
2) Primary SUD outcomes  assessed using the:
i) Substance Use Calendar (SUC) developed by [CONTACT_734056] (Miller and Del Boca, 1994)  and based on 
the Time-Line  Follow-Back (Sobell and Sobell, 1992;  Sobell et al., 1996) and urinalysis  for objective drug use 
assessed 2X/weekly during  the 10 week period (20 urines); 
3) Secondary  Outcome Measures assessing drug craving using the standard brief versions  of the Drug Craving 
questionnaires for cocaine (Cocaine Craving Questionnaire: CCQ, (Tiffany et al., 1993) , cannabis (Marijuana  
Craving Questionnaire: MCQ, (Heishman  et al., 2009)), alcohol (Alcohol Urges Questionnaire: AUQ, (Bohn et

1960)) and depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression  Rating Scale, Ham-D, (Hamilton, 1960)). cognitive 
flexibility will be assessed using the Stroop  Color Word Test; (Golden,  1975) , 
4) Safety and Compliance Assessment using vital signs; the Systematic Assessment  for Treatment  Emergent 
Effects (SAFTEE; (Rabkin et al., 1992)) to assess adverse events; and medication compliance  assessed using 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_734040],  riboflavin markers and plasma levels of GUA. Each of these instruments are widely used, state-of-
the-art and have strong psychometric properties.  
5) Predictor variables:
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ)  (Bernstein,  1998)  is a 28-item self-report inventory that provides 
a brief  screening for histories of abuse  and neglect. The CTQ will be administered  at intake.
The Chronic Stress Checklist (CSC) adapted from the Cumulative Adversity Interview (Turner and Wheaton,  
1995) will be administered  at intake. 
The Perceived  Stress  Scale  (PSS) (Cohen,  Kamarck,  & Mermelstein,  1983)  is a 14 item self-report assessing  the 
degree to which situations  are appraised as threatening  or demanding. The PSS will be administered at intake 
and weekly. 
The Emotion Regulation  Scale (ERS) (DERS) (Nock et al., 2008) is a 36-item questionnaire to provide  a 
comprehensive measure of the difficulties in emotion regulation. The ERS (DERS) will be administered  at 
intake and weekly.
6) Cognitive  Control Testing for Executive Function: 
       The Shipley  Institute  of Living Scale (SHIPLEY) (Shipley, 1940)  has been widely used to assess cognitive    
       functioning and impairment. The Shipley will be administered at the intake.
CANTAB (Cambridge  Cognition, Inc) Battery  will be administered during intake  appointments  and includes 
cognitive tests of executive function.  
7) Laboratory Challenge  Assessments: 
Craving: Participants will rate the intensity of their desire to use primary and secondary drug  of choice  at the 
current time using a 10-point visual analog scale (0= “not at all” and 10= "extremely high").  Visual analog scales 
will also be administered for cocaine, cannabis, alcohol and nicotine craving. 
Anxiety: Participants will rate how  “anxious, nervous and jittery” they feel at the current time  using a 10-point 
visual analog scale anchored as above. Mood: Differential  Emotion Scale (DES: (Izard, 1972)): comprises [ADDRESS_1003041]  describes current  
feelings.   
Cardiovascular:  An ambulatory  ECG (Holter) GE Seer and Seer Lite recorders (digital  sampling 125 sps) will be 
used to measure HRV,  and recordings will be scanned using a GE Mars  Ambulatory  ECG system (PC, version 
7).

Page  6 of 24Saliva: Cortisol saliva samples will be collected  using salivette tubes placed  between their  tongue and cheek 
for approximately 2–3 min until the swab is completely  saturated. Samples will immediately be placed in ice 
subsequent to storage at -80 degrees. All samples will be assayed  in duplicate at the Yale Core Laboratories.
Contingency management for treatment attendance  and behavioral  support: 
Twice weekly treatment attendance will be reinforced  using  standard  contingency  management (CM)  
procedures, which are known to greatly increase study compliance and attendance  (Petry and Simcic, 2002;  
Roll et al., 2006; Stitzer and Petry, 2006).  CM will be provided in the form of a “fishbowl” containing  [ADDRESS_1003042] no monetary value but are imprinted with “good job,” [ADDRESS_1003043]  a value of 
$1, [ADDRESS_1003044] a value of $25, and 1 chip has a value of $100. Upon completion of all requirements  for a 
given visit,  patients will receive fishbowl draws. Attendance  at both weekly visits earns the patient bonus  
draws for that week. Failure  to attend a visit without prior approval or failure to complete  all visit 
requirements results in no draws earned  for that visit and loss of bonus draws for that week. Participants will 
initially earn  three draws per visit in week one with  draws increasing by [CONTACT_734057]. The weekly bonus 
draws will remain constant  at [ADDRESS_1003045] the opportunity  to 
make 264 draws  from  the fishbowl, for estimated earnings of $725  over  3 months. Subjects will also 
participate in weekly (45 minute) manualized cognitive behavioral relapse prevention therapy (Carroll et al., 
1991) integrated with  Medication  Management (MM), providing  advice and support  from medical 
practitioners concomitantly with dispensing  medications,  safety  checking  and compliance  (Pettinati, 2004) . 
Relapse, drop-out and clinical deterioration: Every effort will be made to re-engage women who miss appointments. Clinical deterioration such as exacerbation of psychiatric or withdrawal symptoms will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_734058]. Subjects will be considered drop outs if they do not come back to treatment after receiving two phone calls and two letters inviting them to return.  With the exception of subjects who formally withdraw from the study, we will attempt to assess early terminators at the time of discontinuation and at the 10-week post-treatment point. These subjects will be withdrawn from the study but considered in the intent-to-treat efficacy analyses.

10.Risks: Describe the reasonably  foreseeable risks, including risks to subject  privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with  subjects  participating in the research.

1) Risk associated with taking the study  drug, Guanfacine
Previous research  established use of GUA in children with  ADHD  and tic disorders have used doses  ranging 
from 1.5 to 4 mg/day (Hunt et al., 1995); (Scahill  et al., 2001). Side effects that have  occurred in clinical trials 
in adults with guanfacine  include  dry mouth, sedation, weakness, dizziness, impotence, and constipation. 
Hypotension and bradycardia may  also occur. In the previous work with 3-week treatment of GUA  (3mgs/day)

Page  8 of 24versus placebo, we found it to be safe and well tolerated. In the initial study  (Fox et al., 2012), the most 
common side effects were mild tiredness  and fatigue (guanfacine 24%; placebo:  8%) and headaches 
(guanfacine 18%; placebo 8%).  All symptoms  dissipated  over time without further  intervention. Side effects 
from a dose-ranging study comparing placebo, 2 and 3 mg/day of guanfacine (Fox et al., 2009)  indicated mild 
symptoms which dissipated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_734043] 7/21 individuals in the placebo group (33.33%), 
5/12 individuals in the guanfacine (2mg)  group  (41.7%)  and 4/11 individuals in the guanfacine  (3mg) group 
(36.4%). Furthermore, there were no significant blood pressure differences across medication and placbeo  
groups. Also, there were no significant sex differences in reported side effects.  There  is no evidence  that 
guanfacine will pose a greater risk in the proposed  study sample than  those  previously reported. Importantly, 
patients will be seen  in person on a weekly basis when  information on any potential  side effects will be 
collected; in case of any concerns, the study physician will be alerted  immediately.
2) Risk of including subjects who  are otherwise inappropriate 
The screening  of subjects  using  the inclusion  and exclusion  criteria, and the comprehensive medical and 
psychiatric evaluation will minimize the risk of including subjects who  are otherwise  inappropriate.  All 
subjects recruited  will receive a comprehensive physical examination and laboratory blood work  to ensure 
good physical  health  status. The physical  examinations will be conducted  by [CONTACT_734060], 
who will be aware of study  entry criteria and will manage recruitment as well as physical  and medical 
assessment for this study.  Routine laboratory blood work (CBC, electrolytes, etc.) and blood samples  for 
medication levels  will be collected. Abnormal findings  pertaining to physical health  and blood chemistry  will 
be evaluated further by [CONTACT_734061]. These  are 
routine medical procedures and should add no risks other than  those normally associated  with  these 
procedures. However,  the research  staff, with advice  from the study physician, will ensure  that potential 
participants who may be excluded from research due to medical reasons or pregnancy, or who are in 
immediate need for medical or psychiatric attention, will be referred to primary care/psychiatric  care  facilities  
so they can receive the appropriate clinical  care  needed to address  their condition. Breath screening and 
urine collections are performed  primarily as safeguards  to contamination  of data and should add no risks 
other than those  normally  associated with  these procedures.  Pregnant  women will be excluded  from  the 
study. Female subjects will be asked questions to assess the possibility of pregnancy, and if this information 
fails to establish that pregnancy is highly unlikely then  a serum beta  HCG pregnancy  test will be done prior to 
participation. 
3) The imagery procedure
 Imagery exposure in the laboratory experiments involves reliving personalized stressful,  drug  cue and neutral  
relaxing events, while listening to the guided imagery scripts developed in a previous session.  Although this 
can be particularly emotionally  arousing during the sessions themselves,  our previous experience  has shown 
that there  is very little anxiety that carries over after  the session, thus posing minimal risk. It is, however, 
possible that some drug craving and low mood may linger for a prolonged  period  following the laboratory 
sessions and in order to reduce these symptoms the following safeguards  will be taken:  (a) Subjects will 
participate in relaxation procedures to return craving  levels to baseline  after the laboratory sessions. We have 
found that the relaxation procedures are particularly effective in reducing craving levels after alcohol/drug 
cue exposure.  (b) To enhance response  to relaxation procedures,  subjects  will also be trained on relaxation 
procedures prior to the laboratory sessions. (c) Any subject reporting residual craving or emotional  
discomfort after completion  of laboratory  sessions will receive an individual counseling session by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_734044].  The focus of this session will be

Page  9 of 24In order to ensure that alcohol/substance abusing subjects are not at increased risk for relapse after 
completion of the lab experiments, the following  safeguards will be taken:
(a) After completion  of each  lab session, subjects will be exposed to relaxation procedures to return craving 
levels to baseline.  We have found that relaxation  procedures are particularly effective in reducing craving  
levels after stress imagery (Sinha et al., 1999a.).
(b) To enhance their response to relaxation  procedures, subjects  will be trained  on relaxation procedures in a 
session prior to the testing sessions.
5) Increased risk to subject privacy
To ensure private information regarding  subjects is kept confidential, procedures outlined in the 
‘Confidentiality & Security  of Data’  section  will be followed. Participants in this study will be free to drop  out 
at any time  without penalty. All data will be kept confidential except in cases  of imminent danger to the 
participants. Such limits to confidentiality will be clearly explained to participants  verbally  and in the written 
consent forms. Confidentiality in regard  to collected materials will be maintained via a numbered reference 
system maintained by [CONTACT_473]. Furthermore,  good clinical and research practice procedures and 
HIPAA regulations will be followed.  
12.Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan:  Include  an appropriate Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plan (DSMP) based  on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to 
subjects.)
a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects  participating in this 
study? Greater than minimal risk
b. If children are involved, what  is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating  in this study? n/a

ii.Greater than minimal
Greater Than Minimal  Risk DSMP
1. Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol  compliance,  and 
conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which  must  be conducted at a minimum of every 6 
months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the principal 
investigator (monitor)  will evaluate whether the study  should continue unchanged, require  
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either  the principal investigator,  the IRB or NIH have the 
authority to stop  or suspend the study or require  modifications.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed  greater than  minimal for the following reasons: (choose 
those that apply)
1.We do not view the risks  associated with  taking the study drug, Guanfacine as a minimal risk.
2.Given the now established safety and validity  of the current study drug in our prior work,  we do not view 
the proposed studies as high risk.

Page  [ADDRESS_1003046] assessed the proposed study as one of greater than  minimal  risk, the potential  exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since  it is not possible to predict 
with certainty the absolute  risk in any given individual  or in advance  of first-hand experience with the proposed 
study methods. Therefore, we provide  a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution  of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored  for each  subject participating in the study and attributed  to the study  
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] ([CONTACT_734066]) according  to the following  categories:
a.) Definite:  Adverse event is clearly  related  to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely  related  to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible:  Adverse  event may be related  to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational  procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity  of adverse events noted during the study:
1.Mild adverse event
2.Moderate adverse  event
3.Severe 
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse  Events:
Serious Adverse  Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_734045] a 
Serious Adverse  Event  (SAE).  An  adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes:
1.Death;
2.A life-threatening experience in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_224633]; 
3.A persistent or significant disability or incapacity;  
4.A congenital anomaly  or birth defect; OR
5.Any other adverse event that, based upon  appropriate medical  judgment,  may jeopardize the subject’s 
health and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
this definition. 
An adverse  event  may  be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  Similarly, an 
adverse event  may be graded as moderate but still meet  the criteria for an SAE.   It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_121380] “seriousness”  when determining  whether reporting to the IRB is 
necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including  Adverse Events) to the IRB

Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects  or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical  or non-medical  in 
nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected,  and related  adverse events and 
unanticipated adverse device effects .  Please note  that adverse events are reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_734046] 3 criteria  listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710,  using the appropriate forms

protocol for one site, will be duplicated and submitted to the second site.
13.Statistical Considerations: Describe the statistical  analyses that support the study design. 
Data Management:  Data entry will be conducted using the Web-based REDCAP direct data entry  system.  Both 
sites are fully trained  and running  with  REDCAP and have implemented this platform in clinical  outcome  studies 
with SUD  samples.  Utilizing  the REDCAP system will allow  data to be directly collected into the Yale managed web-
based system  across sites with no identifying information transmitted over the internet.  Field validation (e.g. no 
out of range/invalid responses accepted) and form validation (e.g.  logically impossible responses to different  
questions) are built into the REDCAP system and the study data manager will conduct weekly quality control and 
data management. After  online reviews, the data are archived onto servers and password  protected with  only  
certain members of the team  having appropriate level of data access. All quality control and management issues  
will be addressed immediately and also discussed in the across  site weekly study  meetings.
Data Analysis:  Data analysis will be performed under the direction of Project PIs in consultation with [CONTACT_734068], the Yale biostatistician.  Screening for data entry errors, outlier checks and assessment of missing data 
and testing of normality assumptions will be conducted. Transformations will be applied as necessary. We will 
compare the treatment groups on demographic and clinical variables using t-tests/chi-square analyses as appropriate. 
If any group differences are found, the specific variable will be entered as a covariate in all specific analyses. For the 
primary outcome, we will use significance level of 0.05. Significance levels for secondary outcomes will be adjusted 
using Bonferroni correction for number of analyses performed.  
Adequacy of Sample Size: Sample size estimates  are limited by [CONTACT_734062]/PBO  in SUD  women. As shown in above, data from  our previous work with GUA  yielded  
highly significant sex X med group effects  for target engagement measures of drug craving  and Stroop 
improvements with moderate to high  effect  sizes  (f’s ranging from 0.39-1.22).  Using the GUA/PBO  preliminary 
data from  the 8-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], percent of negative cocaine urines were 40.18% versus  67.86% in PBO  vs GUA for 
the whole group (large effect size d=0.76), with  53.12% versus 100% for PBO  vs. GUA in women (d=1.0) and 35% 
vs 55% negative urines in placebo vs guanfacine in men  (d=0.628). Thus, assuming power=0.80,  and at p<0.05, α 
level of 0.05, sample  size estimates indicate  that we will need  40 subjects  per cell (Medgroup)  to assess GUA/PBO 
in clinical outcome hypotheses in Aim [ADDRESS_1003048] sizes 
(f=0.25, Cohen) with more than 80%  power  assuming α level of 0.[ADDRESS_1003049]  effects in the medium range (f=0.28) with 80% power for all the main effects for 
secondary outcome variables. Including a 20% attrition rate, we propose an N=50 per group  for a total N of 100 
(50 per site).

In a previous  medication development project  (R01-DA27132, PI: [CONTACT_138196]), we conducted  a human  laboratory  study 
to assess GUA  dosing  and its effects on provoked craving, anxiety stress physiology and cognitive flexibility. Men 
and women  with  Cocaine Use Disorder  and co-occurring  substance abuse (non opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]), were admitted on an 
inpatient treatment unit and treated with GUA or placebo (PBO) using a 14-day  titration in a randomized  double 
blind manner (Fox and Sinha, 2014) . Guanfacine at 2 mgs/day versus placebo was able to lower peripheral 
sympathetic arousal  and drug cue-induced craving but did not address stress-induced drug craving in 42 SUD  men  
and women  (25).  Basal  attenuation in norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (p<.05), heart rate (p=.001), and blood  pressure (SBP: 
p<.02; DBP:  p=.01) was seen  in men and women given GUA,  compared with the placebo  group.   
In preparation for the proposed study, [CONTACT_58728] compared guanfacine (3mg/day) versus placebo in a randomized, 
double blind laboratory study of SUD  men  (N=29)  and women (N=13). After the 14-day dosing titration period  and 
at the full 3mgs/day dose, participants were exposed to 3, 10-minute  personalized guided imagery procedures  (i) 
stress, (ii) drug cue, (iii) combined stress / cue, one per day, across three  consecutive  days  in a randomized and 
counterbalanced order (Fox  et al., 2014) ; (Fox  and Sinha, 2014) . Guanfacine was found to be safe and well 
tolerated in both men and women. Drug Group X Sex X Time-point interactions were observed for cocaine 
craving, alcohol craving and anxiety indicating  attenuation of Drug  craving  (cocaine,  nicotine and alcohol) as well 
as anxiety was observed in guanfacine  compared with  the placebo group  immediately following all three 
provocation conditions, but only in the women not the men. A Drug  Group  X Sex interaction for negative mood, 
again indicated a decrease  in negative affect following all three imagery conditions  and time-points in the SUD

Page  14 of 24women on GUA but not men (106). Guanfacine  also attenuated basal  heart rate in males and females, but to a 
greater extent in females  and decreased stress-induced heart  rate in SUD  women  only.  In contrast,  a main effect 
of Drug Group for nicotine craving showed  that guanfacine  was able to reduce  craving  in both men and women 
administered guanfacine  compared with placebo.  [CONTACT_58728] also assessed the Stroop task at baseline and 
immediately following exposure to all three provoked imagery conditions (stress, stress/cue, cue/cue). Findings 
indicated that GUA (3mgs/day) improved stress and cue- provoked Stroop performance relative  to placebo but 
only in women  and not in men. 
In the previous work  with 3-week  treatment  of GUA (3mgs/day) versus placebo  discussed above, [CONTACT_58728]  found 
it to be safe and well tolerated. In the initial study  (25), the most common side effects were mild tiredness and 
fatigue (guanfacine 24%; placebo: 8%) and headaches (guanfacine 18%;  placebo  8%).  All symptoms dissipated  
over time without further intervention. Side effects from a dose-ranging study comparing placebo, 2 and 3 
mg/day of guanfacine (26) (106) indicated  mild symptoms which dissipated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_734048] 7/21 
individuals in the placebo group (33.33%), 5/12 individuals  in the guanfacine (2mg) group  (41.7%) and 4/11 
individuals in the guanfacine (3mg)  group (36.4%). Furthermore, there were no significant blood pressure 
differences across medication and placebo  groups. Also, there were no significant sex differences in reported side 
effects. 
In preparation for this proposal, [CONTACT_58728]  conducted a randomized, double-blind, 8-week  pi[INVESTIGATOR_734049]  
(3mgs/day) with  treatment seeking CUD men  and women (n=7: 5M/2F) vs placebo  (n=7: 4M/3F). Using the same 
16-day titration schedule used previously and proposed in the current project,  GUA  plasma levels  were assessed  
as at weeks [ADDRESS_1003050] that generic GUA with bid dosing was acceptable, and patients showed high medication compliance in the 
outpatient setting. 
Together, data indicates guanfacine 3 mg/day to be safe and tolerable with  regard to assessing target  
engagement and validation across multiple sites in SUD women.

SECTION  IV: PROTECTION OF RESEARCH  SUBJECTS
    Confidentiality & Security  of Data:
1.What protected health information (medical  information along  with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will 
be collected and used  for the research?    
Results of the physical examination, psychological assessments, self-reports, and data collected during the lab 
sessions will be collected and used for research.  The proposed study will be conducted by [CONTACT_734064].  Data collected and 
analyzed in the study  will be derived from three  main  sources (1) semi-structured clinical interviews  and self-
rating scales:  psychiatric  history, medical  history, levels of alcohol  and substance use and demographic self-
reports of age, race, socioeconomic status, marital status, educational and occupational  levels. (2)  
Biophysiological data: includes heart rate, blood pressure, saliva  and plasma HPA axis markers (cortisol and 
ACTH). Additionally, health checks prior to enrollment will comprise  a physical examination and blood work. (3) 
Urine and breathalyzer data: will be used to confirm alcohol and substance use.  It will be collected  at intake  
and during  weekly appointments.

Page  19 of 242.How will the research data be collected, recorded  and stored? 
Research data  will be collected on paper  assessments and using Yale University’s  REDCap system.  All research 
data is stored in two places--one as a hardcopy in a locked file, with records identified only by [CONTACT_2299]’s 
study number, and the second in computerized databases protected by [CONTACT_1192]-level password  systems on Yale 
encrypted desktop  computers.
3.How will the digital data be stored?  ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☐Flash Drive   ☐Portable Hard  Drive   ☒Secured Server   
☐Laptop Computer  ☒Desktop Computer  ☐Other
4.What methods and procedures will be used  to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated  above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
Upon enrollment, all study subjects will be assigned  a unique study number. The study number—and no 
personal identifiers—will be used as labels for study records, samples and any other related research 
documentation. All electronic and digital files will be stored on the secure  Yale network, and the PC accessing 
the network  will be password protected and encrypted. All paper files, such as consent  forms, will be stored in 
a locked file cabinet  in a locked office  and access is limited to members of the study research team.
All portable devices  must contain encryption  software, per University Policy 5100.  If there  is a technical reason a 
device cannot  be encrypted  please submit an exception  request to the Information  Security,  Policy and Compliance 
Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]
5.What will be done with the data  when the research  is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_20913]. If no, describe how  the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured. 
Upon completion of study and data analysis,  a professional information  protection, storage, and disposal 
company will be retained to dispose of research files and informed consent documentation.
6.If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality  been obtained? 
As this study will be NIH funded, we expect that a CoC will be issued as outlined  in the new NIH policy. 
SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits  that may be reasonably expected to result  from  the research, either  to 
the subject(s) or to society  at large. (Payment  of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
All patients will receive free empi[INVESTIGATOR_734052]. 
However, because they will be in an experimental protocol with a medication that may not have direct benefits to the 
individual participant, subjects will be offered payment for completions of research assessments during the 10-week 
trial.  Subjects will also receive vouchers for treatment attendance in the 10-week trial.  Monitoring substance use, as

         SECTION  VI: RESEARCH  ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC  CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other  alternatives are available to the study subjects outside  of the research? 
Subjects need not participate in this study to receive  treatment for SUD.
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments,  and the conditions for receiving  this compensation.
Participants will receive $25 compensation for all the screening visits, $5 a week for returning unused study 
medication, and $25 at weeks 4, 8 and 10. Subjects will be compensated $2 per day for completing the daily 
MetricWire smartphone app surveys, and a $6 bonus for completing all 7 surveys for the week. Subjects will also 
receive vouchers for treatment attendance. The fishbowl contingency management procedure described above 
will be used to enhance treatment retention. Participants can earn a total of 264 draws during the course of the 
study, for estimated earnings of $725. If needed, subjects will also receive bus passes and parking validation 
stickers to help cover transportation costs to attend appointments.
Screening visits: ($25)
Returned medication: 10 x $5 ($50)
$25 bonus at weeks 4, 8, and 10: ($75)
MetricWire: 10 x $20: ($200)
CM fishbowl: max ($725)
Total: $1075
3.Costs  for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly  describe the subject’s costs  associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects.  
All parts of the research process will be provided at no cost to the subjects.
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than  minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research that presents  the potential for physical harm (e.g.,  research involving blood draws).
a.Will medical  treatment  be available if research-related injury occurs? Medical therapy will be 
offered for any physical  injuries sustained as a consequence of participation in this research
b.Where and from whom may treatment  be obtained? Any licensed facility / practitioner

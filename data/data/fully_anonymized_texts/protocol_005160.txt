Study Objective  Demonstrate that patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure with the GORE® HELEX® 
Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  plus antiplatelet 
medical management is safe and effective and reduces the risk of recurrent stroke 
or imaging -confirmed transient ischemic attack (TIA) when compared to antiplatelet 
medical management alone in patients with a PFO and history of cryptogen ic stroke 
or imaging -confirmed TIA.  
 
A co-primary objective is to demonstrate that medical management plus closure 
with the study device reduces the risk of new brain infarct  compared to medical 
management alone.

1. Introduction 
1.1. Backgrou nd 
In the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.), stroke is been recognized as a leading cause of both death and 
disability (CDC 2001, Rosamond 2007).  Approximately 700,[ADDRESS_536628] of more 
than $[ADDRESS_536629] productivity and total health care costs (Rosamond 2007).  
Approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic, resulting from a blockage in a blood vessel.  
Even after extensive investigation, up to 40% of all ischemic strokes have no clear 
pathogenesis and are considered cryptogenic (Halperin 2002).  
 
The historical treatment for cryptogenic stroke is medical therapy, including antiplatelet and/or 
anticoagulation medication.  These regimens, however, can increase the risk of bleeding 
complications and may not prevent recurrent ischemic neurological events (McBride 1994, 
Stone 1996).  Thus, research has turned to identifying potential etiologies of ischemic stroke 
having no detectable thromboembolic source.  
 
Increasingly, attention has been focused on the potential relationship between Patent 
Foramen Ovale (PFO) and cryptogenic stroke, when there is no other detected 
thromboembolic source.  Studies of cryptogenic stroke patients have found that those with 
PFO are younger and less likely to have traditional risk factors for stroke than those without 
PFO, suggesting a different stroke mechanism within this subset (Lamy 2002).  Proposed 
mechanisms of PFO-induced stroke include embolism from the peripheral venous system 
through the PFO and genesis of thromboembolism directly from the endocardial surface of the 
atrial septum [Halperin 2002].  Although rare, additional documented cases of 
thromboembolism have been observed within a PFO (Caes 1995, Falk 1997).   
 
The frequency of PFO in patients with presumed normal hearts has been estimated at 
approximately 25%, based on autopsy studies (Hagen 1984).  Controlled studies in the current 
literature consistently report statistically higher prevalence of PFO among cryptogenic stroke 
populations (between 40-75%) compared to (between 5-30%) non-cryptogenic stroke 
populations (Lechat 1988, Webster 1988, Di Tullio 1992, Itoh 1994, Job 1994, Chant 2001, 
Chen 1991, and Homma 2002).  These findings suggest that embolization through the PFO 
may provide a plausible etiology of stroke in some patients.  Nevertheless, a causal 
relationship between PFO and cryptogenic stroke remains open to debate, since other studies 
have reported statistically insignificant differences in the occurrence of PFO in patients with 
cryptogenic stroke versus control populations (Petty 2006, Meissner 2006). 
 
Contributing to this uncertainty, the extent of increased risk of recurrent embolic events for 
cryptogenic stroke patients with a PFO remains unclear compared to cryptogenic stroke 
patients without a PFO.  Recurrent-event rates for patients with and without a PFO reported in 
the literature vary from 0% to 15% and include many confounding factors (Mas 1995, De 
Castro 2000, Mas 2001, Homma 2002, and Messe 2004).  Further, several of these studies 
found similar recurrent stroke rates in patients regardless of the presence of a PFO (Mas 
2001, Homma 2002, and De Castro 2000).   
 
For example, the Patent Foramen Ovale in Cryptogenic Stroke Study (PI[INVESTIGATOR_424500]), reported on 
265 patients (42.1%) with cryptogenic stroke and 365 patients (57.9%) with strokes of known 
HLX 06-03 AMDT 3 15-JAN- 2016          GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
etiology.  The average annual risks of death or subsequent stroke in the entire cohort among 
patients with and without PFO were 7.4% and 7.7%, respectively, and 7.15% and 6.35% 
among patients with and without PFO in the cryptogenic stroke subset (Homma 2002).   
 
Although a direct association of PFO with cryptogenic stroke or its recurrence has yet to be 
validated, additional existing evidence suggests a combination of PFO and any one of various 
synergistic factors may exacerbate the risk of stroke.  Such features include increased shunt 
through the PFO and the presence of an atrial septal aneurysm.  Other evidence suggests that 
certain features of the PFO, atrial septal aneurysm and degree of shunting, as well as multiple 
cerebral infarcts/TIA, Valsalva preceding the presenting event, and age also may contribute to 
increased stroke risk (Webster 1988, Cabanes 1993, Hausmann 1995, Stone 1996, and De 
Castro 2000).  As before, consensus on each of these factors also still is lacking.  
 
With regard to the morphological characteristics of the PFO and the atrial endocardium, De 
Castro, et al. (2000) found that “high-risk” patients with both right- to-left shunting at rest and 
increased septal mobility had significantly higher risk  of recurrent stroke at three years 
compared to PFO patients with no shunting at rest (12.5% versus 4.3%; p=0.05).  Additionally, 
presence of an atrial septal aneurysm accompanying a PFO has been associated with higher 
stroke risk in several studies (Cabanes 1993, Mas 1995, De Castro 2000, and Mas 2001).  
Although Mas, et al. (2001) did not find an increased risk of recurrent stroke for patients with 
PFO only, they did report increased risk for patients with PFO plus an atrial-septal aneurysm 
(4-year recurrent-event rate of 2.3% for patients with PFO, 15.2% for patients with PFO and 
atrial-septal aneurysm, and 4.2% for patients with neither of these cardiac abnormalities).  In 
the PI[INVESTIGATOR_424501] (Homma 2002) and prospective studies by [CONTACT_9195], et al. (2002) and 
Harrer, et al. (2006), however, presence of an atrial-septal aneurysm was not associated with 
increased incidence of recurrent embolic events after either medical treatment or closure of 
the PFO with a device (p > 0.05).   
 
Finally, with regard to age, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_424502] a PFO in patients younger than 55 (p=0.15) or in patients 55 to 64 
years old (p=0.48).  In contrast, patients with a PFO who were older than 65 years were 4.14 
times more likely to experience a recurrent stroke than those without a PFO (p=0.01).  Other 
studies have indicated, however, that young cryptogenic stroke patients with a PFO are at 
increased risk (Lechat 1988, Ranoux 1993) and recurrence rates of up to 15% in patients 
younger than 50 years remain a serious concern (Sievert 2004).  
 
To summarize, several plausible etiologies and risk factors for cryptogenic stroke have been 
considered.  However, associated data still are inconclusive as to whether a difference in 
recurrent embolic event rates exists between cryptogenic stroke patients with and without a 
PFO, as well as with or without other putative risk factors.  Based on available data, many 
physicians already have accepted a causal relationship between PFO and stroke, particularly 
in younger patients (Ranoux 1993, Bogousslavsky 1996).  Indeed, many consider 
transcatheter/percutaneous closure the treatment of choice for these patients in light of the 
risks associated with medical therapy, i.e., lifelong anticoagulation and surgical PFO closure 
(Sievert 2004).  In addition, various studies have been, or currently are, underway to 
determine if transcatheter closure can further reduce the risk of recurrent embolic events for 
cryptogenic stroke patients with a PFO.  Although these studies are not randomized, controlled 
multicenter trials, the data are promising and suggest that a reduction in recurrent-events 
occurs after PFO closure.

In a primary example of risk reduction following PFO closure, Schuchlenz, et al. (2005) studied 
280 consecutive patients with cryptogenic cerebrovascular events and PFO.  The annual 
recurrence rates of patients treated with medical therapy (13% for patients treated with platelet 
inhibitors, 5.6% for those on oral anticoagulation) and for those treated with device closure 
(0.6%) were statistically different (p < 0.001).  In this study, PFO diameters > 4 mm and 
multiple previous cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs) also were found to be independent 
predictors of recurrent stroke.   
 
Similarly, Windecker, et al. (2004) compared risk of recurrent events in 308 patients with 
cryptogenic stroke and PFO who were treated either medically or with percutaneous PFO 
closure.  At four years of follow-up, percutaneous PFO closure resulted in a nonsignificant 
trend (p=0.08) toward risk reduction of recurrent stroke or TIA compared with medical 
treatment (7.8% versus 22.2%, respectively).  Further, patients with more than one 
cerebrovascular event at baseline and those with complete PFO occlusion were at significantly 
lower risk for recurrent stroke or TIA when compared with medically treated patients (7.3% 
versus 33.2%, p=0.01).  
 
Although limited by [CONTACT_424513], a meta-analysis (Khairy, et al., 
2003) of ten studies of transcatheter closure (1355 patients) and six studies of medical therapy 
(895 patients) demonstrated that transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale may prevent a 
substantial proportion of cryptogenic strokes.  Overall, the one-year rate of recurrent 
neurologic thromboembolism with transcatheter intervention was 0% to 4.9%, while medical 
management was associated with one-year recurrence rates of 3.8% to 12.0%.  
 
A recently published study (Harrer, et al. 2006), however, did not show a difference in 
recurrent-event rates among 124 patients with cryptogenic stroke and PFO who were treated 
either medically or had PFO closure (34 transcatheter, 7 surgical).  Annual stroke recurrence 
rates were generally low and comparable among all groups (2.9% percutaneous closure, 2.1% 
medical closure, 0% surgical closure, 2.2% no therapy).  Of the two patients who experienced 
recurrent events after transcatheter closure, both were found to have residual shunts.  
 
Recurrent-event rates after transcatheter closure of PFOs in non-controlled studies have 
ranged between 0-6%.  In initial and intermediate reports from the AGA U.S. Multicenter 
Clinical Trial, of a total of 94 patients, no recurrent thromboembolic complications were 
reported following implantation of the Amplatzer® PFO occluder (Hong 2003, Du 2002, and 
Bruch 2002).  In a prospective study, (Braun, et al. 2002), 276 patients underwent PFO 
closure using the PFO Star device.  The mean follow-up time was 15.1 months.  During the 
follow-up period, only six patients (1.7%) had recurrent events, all of which were TIAs 
occurring within the first six months after implantation.  Martin, et al. (2002) also conducted a 
prospective study to investigate immediate and long-term outcomes of 110 patients who, after 
paradoxical embolism, underwent percutaneous PFO closure with either a Sideris Button or 
CardioSEAL® occluder.  An annual risk of recurrence of 0.9% based on a mean follow-up of 
2.[ADDRESS_536630] reported embolic recurrence rates following percutaneous PFO closure of 
3.2% with mean follow-up of 2.6 years (Hung 2000); 3.4% with mean follow-up of 1.6 years 
(Windecker 2000); and 0.0% with mean follow-up of 8.4 months (Bridges 1992).  Differences 
in the outcomes of these PFO closure studies may be due to factors specific to the devices

used, e.g. thrombus formation, closure rates, and device complications or to patient variability, 
atrial-septal aneurysm (ASA), size of shunt, multiple cerebral infarcts/TIA, and patient age.  
Randomized multicenter clinical trials with appropriate rigorous patient selection need to be 
conducted to provide definitive objective data to clarify the relationship between presence of a 
PFO in cryptogenic stroke patients and increased risk of recurrent embolic events.  Even with 
these considerations, current data suggest that transcatheter closure of PFO has the potential 
for reducing the rate of recurrent ischemic events. 
 
In the [LOCATION_002], three additional clinical trials comparing PFO closure to medical 
management for recurrent stroke prevention are in various stages: the CLOSURE-I study 
sponsored by [CONTACT_424514]; the RESPECT trial sponsored by [CONTACT_99894]. Jude Medical Corp.; and the 
CARDIA trial sponsored by [CONTACT_424515].  Each of these clinical trials have faced, major 
enrollment issues and the consensus among the medical community is that enrollment 
difficulties stem from patient and physician bias toward closure. Also, it has been suggested 
that patients with significant concern for a paradoxical event are often unwilling to risk 
randomization to the medical treatment control arm.   
 
Further complicating slow enrollment in these studies are the low risk of recurrent embolic 
events (generally < 4%) and the consequent large numbers of patients required for statistically 
powering studies.  If strokes alone (excluding TIAs) are included in the primary endpoint to 
reduce confounding factors, annual risk of recurrent embolic events is even less, generally < 
2%, and an even larger number of patients is required.  For patients being treated with 
antiaggregants or anticoagulants, Bogousslavsky, et al. (1996) reported an average annual 
recurrence rate of 1.9% for stroke alone and 3.8% for stroke and TIA.  For patients with a PFO 
and no atrial septal aneurysm, Mas, et al. (2001) reported that the risk of stroke alone at two 
years was 1.8%, while the risk of either stroke or TIA was 4.6%.  In the Mas study, presence of 
an atrial septal aneurysm in PFO patients also increased the risk of recurrent events.  The risk 
of stroke at two years was 4.0% while the risk of either stroke or TIA was 8.0% in that group. 
 
The study design described in the Clinical Study Plan (Section 4.0 of this document) 
addresses the difficulties encountered in other studies in several ways.  Patients will b e 
enrolled into the study from European countries where device availability outside of trials is 
less of an obstacle to enrollment than in the U.S. and patients are more willing to participate in 
randomized trials.  The study design employs a 2:1, device (test) arm to medical treatment 
(control) arm, randomization scheme.  Because this study allows more patients in the device 
treatment arm, it provides incentive for patients to be randomized.  Finally, a comparison of 
screening Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) or Computed Tomographs (CTs) with end- of-
study MRIs or CTs will yield more definitive information on the nature and etiology of recurrent 
embolic events in the study population.   
 
The original closure device selected for this trial is the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder, 
manufactured by W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc.  It is comprised of an implantable prosthesis 
(Occluder) and a catheter delivery system.  The Occluder is designed to be soft, atraumatic to 
surrounding tissue, and to conform to septal anatomy in order to provide safe and effective 
PFO closure.  The safety and efficacy of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder for closing 
small to medium atrial septal defects (ASDs) has been demonstrated in U.S. studies (Zahn 
2001, Latson 2006, and Jones 2007).  The excellent closure rates and few complications 
provide the rationale for use of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder in the present study.

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
In Europe, nearly a decade of experience regarding the safety and efficacy of PFO closure 
with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder has been reported in the literature (Sievert 2001, 
Krumsdorf 2004, Wahl 2005, Billinger 2006, and Schrale 2007).  Based on information 
available to date, the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder represents an ideal device for use in a 
study of the association between PFO closure and recurrent stroke reduction because of its 
low rate of mild clinical complications and established efficacy for defect closure. 
 
During the course of the Gore REDUCE Clinical Study, W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. 
developed a new septal defect occluder. As with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder, the 
GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  provides a soft, atraumatic, conformable option for 
the closure of patent foramen ovale. Initial experience with the device, through its development 
and observations from its initial clinical use, demonstrate that this device is easier to use than 
the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder.  It additionally is thought to provide quicker closure of 
the defect than the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder, while maintaining a similar safety profile. 
Thus, upon its availability, this device will be used as the device of choice within the test arm 
of the study. 
 
1.2. Summary of Clinical Experience with  GORE® HELEX® Septal Occlud er 
Considerable clinical experience has been gained with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder 
since it became commercially available in Europe in June [ADDRESS_536631] 2006.  
Published data demonstrate that the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder provides a reliable and 
safe system for occlusion of small and moderate ASDs and PFOs with minimal risk of major 
complications (Sievert 2001, 2002, Pedra 2003, Billinger 2006, Jones 2007).   
 
FDA-reviewed studies leading to approval of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder for closure 
of ASDs included the GORE Feasibility study (two-center, single-arm), the GORE Pi[INVESTIGATOR_45880] (multicenter, surgical control arm, nonrandomized), and the GORE Continued Access 
study (multicenter, single-arm, prospective), with a total of 388 patients receiving a device.  
The clinical success outcomes from the GORE Pi[INVESTIGATOR_424503], 
noninferiority hypothesis (p <0.001; two-sample binomial proportions test with noninferiority 
margin = 10%).  The Composite Clinical Success of the Continued Access study, defined as 
no major adverse events or repeat procedures and clinical closure success at 12 months, was 
92.6%.  To date, portions of these data have been presented in the peer-reviewed literature 
(Vincent 2003, Latson 2006, and Jones 2007). 
 
In Europe, the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder is indicated for closure of both ASDs and 
PFOs.  Over [ADDRESS_536632] discussed 
the safety and efficacy of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder for transcatheter closure of 
PFOs (Sievert 2001, Krumsdorf 2001, 2004, Wahl 2005, and Billinger 2006).  Billinger, et al. 
(2006) demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder for 
transcatheter PFO closure in a large series of patients (128) receiving the HELEX® device.  
Their follow-up included evaluations of residual right- to-left shunt, device-related adverse 
events, and recurrent embolic events.  Right- to-left shunt was resolved completely in 90% of 
the patients, a result similar to occlusion rates reported for other septal occluders (Wahl 2001, 
Beitzke 2001, Martin 2002, and Braun 2002).  Furthermore, there were no reported strokes 
and only one reported TIA (0.8% recurrence) after a mean follow-up of 21 months.  This mean 
recurrence rate of 0.9% per year compares favorably with recurrence rates of up to 3.4% per 
year observed in closure studies utilizing other devices (Windecker 2000, Beitzke 2001, Martin 
2002, Braun 2002, and Wahl 2005).

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  Page 6 of 54 
TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
 
Wahl, et al. (2005) also reported on effectiveness and safety of several septal occluder 
devices, including the HELEX® device, for transcatheter PFO closure in patients with 
cryptogenic stroke.  In this study, there were no complications for patients receiving a HELEX® 
implant, the rate of residual shunt for the HELEX® device was 5% (the lowest of all of devices 
tested, e.g. compared to 9%, the next lowest rate).  The rate of recurrent embolic events, 0%, 
was among the lowest of all devices tested. 
 
In an earlier study, Sievert, et al. (2001), seven types of septal occluders were implanted in 
281 patients; 33 received HELEX® Septal Occluders.  In the HELEX® device group, no 
adverse events were reported.  During mean follow-up of 12 months, the average annual 
embolic recurrence rate was 3.3% across all devices, but 0% for patients who received 
HELEX Septal Occluders. 
 
Thrombus formation on atrial septal occluders generally is rare, but is a potential clinical 
complication that could cause an embolic event.  The expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 
(ePTFE) material used in the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder is less thrombogenic than 
most other materials across a multitude of implanted medical devices (vascular patches, stent-
grafts, surgical patches, etc).  This low thrombogenicity also has been demonstrated in the 
GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder.  To date, there has been only one documented report of 
thrombus formation associated with a GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder (Krumsdorf 2004).  In 
that study, thrombus formation was evaluated on nine different types of septal occluders 
implanted in a total of 1000 patients, 161 of whom received a HELEX® device.  The rate of 
thrombus formation for the HELEX® device was 0.8% (one patient), compared to rates as high 
as 7% for other occluders.   
 
To conclude, multiple studies reported in the scientific literature provide many examples and 
data that have implicated PFO as a contributing factor to increased risk of ischemic embolic 
event.  This putative correlation is supported further by [CONTACT_424516].  Clinical experience with 
the GORE® HELEX® Septal and the GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  illustrate these 
devices’ potential for demonstrating a reduction of recurrent ischemic embolic events.  With 
the Gore REDUCE Clinical Study, W.L. Gore & Associates will provide the clinical basis to 
support this claim by [CONTACT_424517]® 
HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  reduces the risk of 
recurrent stroke or TIA while maintaining a minimal complication rate.

1.3. Device Description 
1.3.1. GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder 
The approved GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder is comprised of an implantable 
prosthesis and a catheter delivery system (control catheter, delivery catheter, and 
mandrel).   
 
The implanted portion of the GORE®HELEX® Septal Occluder is helical in shape 
when stretched and supported by [CONTACT_424518], but resumes a low-profile 
shape when fully deployed in the heart (Figure 2). The Occluder is comprised of a 
hydrophilic, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) material supported by a 
nickel-titanium (nitinol), supporting wire frame.  The ePTFE material is supported by 
[CONTACT_424519], central, and proximal nitinol eyelets.  
 
 
 
The GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder implantable device is supplied in five nominal 
diameters of 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 30 mm, or 35 mm.  The GORE® HELEX® Septal 
Occluder is deployed from a 10-French (Fr) outer diameter delivery system. 
 
 
Figure 2: The GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder 
 
1.3.2. GORE® Delivery System 
The GORE® Catheter Delivery System is a catheter assembly composed of three 
primary components:   
 Delivery Catheter: Delivers the Occluder to the treatment site. 
 Control Catheter: Advances/retracts the Occluder at the treatment site. 
 Mandrel: Supports the nitinol frame and the locking mechanism of the Occluder. 
 
The control catheter is equipped with a white retrieval cord to retrieve the Occluder if 
necessary.  A red retrieval cord cap on the proximal end of the control catheter 
secures the retrieval cord until Occluder release.  The mandrel provides mechanical 
support to the Occluder frame during deployment.  In conjunction with the control 
catheter, the mandrel is used to guide and form the Occluder during deployment.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  Page 8 of 54 
TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
The catheter components are arranged coaxially within one another at the distal tip of 
the catheter.  Proximal to the distal tip of the catheter, the control catheter is slotted to 
allow the mandrel to bifurcate out and run parallel to the control catheter.  The 
mandrel runs parallel to the control catheter within the delivery catheter for the 
remaining distance to the y-arm (Figure 3).   
 
 
 
Figure 3: The GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder Catheter Delivery System 
 
1.3.3. GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder Package Configuration 
The packaging configuration contains a holding tray, ethylene oxide gas compatible 
pouches, and a carton, all labeled appropriately.  The tray is packaged within the dual 
pouches, and the pouches are packaged within the carton.  The carton and the outer 
package are labeled appropriately and Instructions for Use are included.  The 
packaging configuration is validated to provide an appropriate sterile barrier. 
 
The GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder and catheter delivery system arrive within the 
tray in a fully deployed state (Figure 4).

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
1.3.4. GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder   
The GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  consists of an implantable occluder 
and a catheter delivery system. The occluder is comprised of five platinum-filled 
nickel-titanium (Nitinol) wires, which form a frame covered with expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The ePTFE is treated with a hydrophilic coating to 
facilitate echocardiographic imaging of the occluder and surrounding tissue during 
implantation. When fully deployed, the occluder assumes a double-disc configuration 
(Figure 5) to prevent shunting of blood between the right and left atria.  
 
The occluder is configured in nominal diameters of 15, 20, 25, and 30mm.  The 
occluder is delivered using conventional catheter delivery techniques and may be 
delivered with the aid of a 0.035" guidewire, or smaller, if necessary.   
 
 
Figure 5 : GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  
 
1.3.5. GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  Delivery System 
The delivery system consists of a 75 cm working length 10 Fr (O.D.) delivery catheter, 
a control catheter, and a mandrel coupled to a handle (Figure 6). The handle 
facilitates loading, deployment, and locking of the occluder. The handle also allows 
repositioning and retrieval of the occluder via the retrieval cord, if necessary.  
 
The catheter delivery system for the GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  is a 
catheter and handle assembly composed of four primary components:  
 Delivery Catheter: Delivers the occluder to the treatment site. 
 Control Catheter: Advances/retracts the occluder at the treatment site. 
 Mandrel: Supports the Nitinol frame and the locking mechanism of the occluder. 
 Handle: Facilitates simple push/pull motions for occluder loading, deployment, 
and locking.

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
The catheter components are arranged coaxially and are coupled to the handle 
mechanism. The handle moves the catheter components separately or in 
combination to facilitate simple push/pull motions for occluder loading, deployment, 
and locking.  The retrieval cord attaches the proximal eyelet of the occluder to the 
control catheter and facilitates occluder retrieval after lock release, if necessary.  A 
flexible flushing port is attached to the handle to permit convenient device flushing 
prior to implant.

2. Study Design and Statistical Considerations 
2.1. Study Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that antiplatelet medical management 
plus PFO closure with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal 
Occluder  reduces the risk of a recurrent stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA compared to 
antiplatelet medical management alone in patients with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and 
history of cryptogenic stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA.   
 
A co-primary objective is to demonstrate that medical management plus closure with the study 
device reduces the risk of new brain infarct compared to medical management alone. 
 
A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the GORE® 
HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder for the transcatheter 
closure of PFO. 
 
2.2. Study Design Overview 
The Gore REDUCE Clinical Study is a prospective, randomized, multinational, multicenter 
evaluation comparing antiplatelet medical management (control arm) to PFO closure plus 
antiplatelet medical management with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® 
CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  (test arm) for the reduction of recurrent stroke or imaging-
confirmed TIA or new brain infarct in subjects with a PFO and history of cryptogenic stroke or 
imaging-confirmed TIA. 
 
A total of [ADDRESS_536633] or control arm using a 2:1 
randomization scheme.  A maximum of eighty (80) investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002], 
Canada, and Europe will participate in the study with no per-site subject limit.  The anticipated 
accrual rate is approximately 10 subjects per month for a total accrual period of approximately 
60-66 months. 
 
Randomized subjects will be followed for up to five (5) years.  For the control arm, follow- up 
intervals will be calculated from the date of randomization.  For the test arm, follow-up intervals 
will be calculated from the date of the transcatheter closure procedure.  All subjects will 
receive follow-up evaluations at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and [ADDRESS_536634]-procedure (within 4 to 72 hours 
following the transcatheter closure procedure).  
 
2.3. Primary Endpoints 
Co-Primary Endpoint [ADDRESS_536635]-randomization, of one of the 
following: 
 Clinical finding of ischemic stroke that may be associated with MRI evidence of a new 
relevant brain infarction.  For this study, an ischemic stroke is defined as a neurological 
deficit, presumed due to ischemia, persisting longer than 24 hours or until death.

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
 Clinical finding of TIA that also has MRI evidence of a new relevant brain infarction.  For 
this study, a TIA is defined as a transient neurological deficit, presumed due to ischemia, 
persisting less than 24 hours. 
 
Clinical findings of stroke/TIA may include:  
 Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the 
body)  
 Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech  
 Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes  
 Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination  
 Sudden severe headache with no known cause  
 
Co-Primary Endpoint [ADDRESS_536636]. 
 
All deaths and suspected recurrent stroke/TIA events will be reviewed and adjudicated by a 
Clinical Events Committee (CEC).  In the event of subject death, all possible efforts will be 
made to obtain relevant records from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_424504]’s primary care physician, 
including a death certificate or autopsy report, to determine the cause of death. 
Co-primary Endpoint [ADDRESS_536637] one new T2 
hyperintense MRI lesion with diameter ≥ [ADDRESS_536638]-based binomial proportion. 
 
2.4. Secondary Endpoints 
Safety Endpoints  will include the proportion of subjects who experience adverse events 
(AEs) that are determined to be related to device, procedure, and/or antiplatelet medical 
management.  This will include specific adverse events and groups of adverse events such as 
all-cause adverse events, device-related events, procedure-related events, antiplatelet 
medical therapy-related events, and any serious adverse events. 
 
The safety endpoints may also be analyzed using time- to-event methods to estimate the 
percentage of subjects free from the event at time points of interest, such as [ADDRESS_536639]-randomization (or post-procedure for the test arm). 
 
Efficacy Endpoints will evaluate the success of the device in achieving PFO closure in 
subjects randomized to the test arm.  PFO closure success will be measured by [CONTACT_424520]- to-left shunt after device implant.  Time points for the assessment of 
PFO closure include early post-procedure, 1 month, 12 months, and 24 months. 
 
Additional Secondary Endpoints  will include: 
1. Clinical Success  –

3. Time to  any stroke/TIA – defined as time from randomization to first occurrence of stroke 
or TIA 
4. Device Success – defined as the proportion of device arm subjects with successful 
implant and retention of the device after procedure (test arm only) 
 
2.5. Primary Study Hypotheses 
This study is designed to test the null hypothesis that the hazard of a recurrent stroke or 
imaging-confirmed TIA in subjects treated with percutaneous PFO closure plus antiplatelet 
medical management is equal to or higher than subjects treated with antiplatelet medical 
management alone.  The alternative hypothesis is that the hazard of a recurrent 
stroke/imaging-confirmed TIA is lower in subjects treated with percutaneous PFO closure plus 
antiplatelet medical management compared to antiplatelet medical management alone.  In

where: 
HR T/C = hazard ratio comparing the test (T) arm (PFO closure) to the control (C) arm 
(antiplatelet medical management only). 
In addition, this study will test the null hypothesis that the incidence of brain infarct at [ADDRESS_536641] incidence is lower in subjects treated 
with percutaneous PFO closure plus antiplatelet medical management compared to 
antiplatelet medical management alone. In statistical terms:

where: 
PC = true proportion of subjects with incident brain infarct in the control group 
PT = true proportion of subjects with incident brain infarct in the test group 
 
2.6. Sample Size Determination 
2.6.1. Sample Size Assumptions 
Based on literature available at the study’s initiation (see Section 1.0 - Introduction), 
the proportion of PFO patients free from a recurrent stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA 
at 24 months after initial, cryptogenic stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA is assumed to 
be approximately 92%, with a range of 86% to 94%.  Antiplatelet medical 
management plus PFO closure will be considered superior to antiplatelet medical 
management alone if there is at least a 55% reduction in the hazard of a recurrent 
stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA.

At the time this study was designed, Co-primary Endpoint 2 was considered a 
secondary endpoint and was not relevant to the sample size assumptions. 
2.6.2. Randomization and Enrollment  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_536642] arm.  Enrollment of 120 to 140 subjects per year is 
anticipated, for a total enrollment period of 60-66 months (5 to 5.5 years).

2.7. Randomization Scheme 
Patients who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the two study 
treatment arms.  Randomization will be weighted 2:[ADDRESS_536643] of randomized subjects with valid MRI core lab data at 
screening and an appropriate follow-up, where follow-up will be at 24 months or immediately 
following a recurrent event (suspected stroke or TIA), whichever occurs first, as well as 
randomized subjects who experience a confirmed recurrent event through 24 months 
regardless of MRI data status. Responders are subjects who show one or more new 
infarction(s) on MRI since screening or experience a confirmed recurrent event. 
Nonresponders are subjects who do not show new infarction on MRI since screening and do 
not experience a confirmed recurrent event. 
 
The primary analysis will be a two-sample comparison of the binomial proportion of subjects 
with brain infarct between the two treatment groups. Each binomial proportion will be 
calculated as the count of responders divided by [CONTACT_424521] (sum of the 
responder and nonresponder counts). 
The hypothesis will be tested using a two-sample binomial proportions test: 
𝑧 =𝑝𝐶− 𝑝 𝑇
√𝑝𝐶(1 − 𝑝 𝐶)
𝑛𝐶+𝑝𝑇(1 − 𝑝 𝑇)
𝑛𝑇  
where:

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
pC = observed brain infarct proportion in control group 
nC = number of evaluable subjects in control group 
pT = observed brain infarct proportion in test group 
nT = number of evaluable subjects in test group 
The test statistic z is assumed to have a standard Normal distribution. The significance level 
for this test will be set at a 1-sided  = 0.025 , but the p-value will be adjusted for multiplicity 
with the 1-sided  = 0.[ADDRESS_536644] performed simultaneously on the primary endpoint. Therefore, 
pC−pT> 0 and a multiplicity-adjusted p-value  0.[ADDRESS_536645] compared to the control treatment. The 1-sided multiplicity-
adjusted p-value and unadjusted 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
proportions will be reported. 
 
2.9. Interim Analyses 
The original protocol specified that, in addition to standard study monitoring, an interim 
analysis will be performed after approximately 50% of the total expected recurrent stroke or 
imaging-confirmed TIA events have occurred. This milestone event had not occurred as of the 
completion of full enrollment in February 2015. Under the plan described herein, the original 
interim analysis plan no longer serves its purpose and is rescinded. 
A new interim analysis that does not involve any statistical hypothesis testing is anticipated to 
occur around April 2016. No analyses that would require alpha spending are planned for this 
interim analysis. 
 
2.10. Statistical Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary endpoint analysis will be performed in conjunction with the primary endpoint 
analysis.  Statistical methods for testing multiple endpoints will be utilized in the comparison of 
secondary endpoints across test and control to preserve the overall Type I error rate.

to the overall 1-sided  = 0.[ADDRESS_536647] been enrolled, the 
new study device (GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder ) will become available and will be 
used as the device of choice within the test arm of the study. As a regulatory requirement, an 
assessment of poolability will be conducted for the two study device subgroups in the test arm. 
The statistical plan for this assessment will consist of two stages: baseline homogeneity and 
primary outcome comparability. 
 
For baseline homogeneity, the two test device subgroups will be compared on the following six 
baseline demographic and predictor covariates: age, gender , qualifying cerebrovascular event, 
balloon-sized PFO diameter, PFO tunnel length , and presence of atrial septal aneurysm. 
These subgroup comparisons will use the two-sample t-test, chi-square test, or Fisher’s Exact 
test, depending on the distribution of the covariate. 
 
For primary outcome comparability, covariate- by-device interactions will be assessed using 
Cox proportional hazards regression models where main effects for device and the covariate 
and the covariate- by-device interaction term will be regressed on the 24-month freedom from 
recurrent stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA primary endpoint; this will be performed individually 
for each of the six baseline covariates. Statistically significant interactions will be assessed

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
graphically for the nature of the interaction (quantitative vs. qualitative). Qualitative interactions 
(difference in direction of device effect across levels of covariate) will suggest differences 
between the device subgroups, leading to analyses performed separately for each device 
subgroup. A similar approach will be used for brain infarct comparability, but using a logistic 
regression model for this binary endpoint. 
 
Finally, device subgroup and any baseline covariates deemed to be different between device 
subgroups will be included as main effects in a Cox regression model on the primary endpoint. 
If the device subgroup term is statistically significant and the observed hazard reduction (test 
vs. control) for either of the device subgroups is less than the hypothesized 55%, then the 
device subgroups will not be considered outcome comparable, leading to analyses performed 
separately for each device subgroup. A similar approach will be used for brain infarct 
comparability, but using a logistic regression model for this binary endpoint. 
 
A significance level of =0.15 will be used for these poolability tests, without correction for 
multiplicity. Since this evaluation plan calls for a minimum of 13 significance tests per 
endpoint, the overall Type-I error rate per endpoint for this analysis may exceed 1 − (1 − 
0.15)13 = 0.88.

3. Clinical Study Plan 
3.1. Ethical Considerations 
The clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the applicable national regulatory 
requirements, the US Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations (21 CFR § 812) and 
the current European ISO standard, as required.  In addition, the clinical study will comply with 
the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.   
3.2. Study Initiation 
Initiation of the clinical study can begin following: 
 FDA approval of the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), and  
 Sponsor receipt of notification of the investigational site Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
or Ethics Committee (EC) approval, and  
 Sponsor’s receipt of an executed Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) or Clinical Trial Letter of 
Agreement (CTLA) for the investigational site.   
 
3.3. Subject Population 
Subjects will be enrolled at a maximum of eighty (80) investigational sites in the [LOCATION_002], 
Canada and Europe.  All potential subjects must have been diagnosed with cryptogenic stroke 
or imaging-confirmed TIA and the presence of a PFO and be at risk for recurrent stroke or TIA 
event. 
 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to a treatment arm in a 2:1 fashion (device- to-antiplatelet 
medical therapy).  This randomization will result in approximately [ADDRESS_536648] (device) arm 
and 221 subjects in the control (antiplatelet medical therapy) arm. 
 
3.4. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 
3.4.1. General Inclusion Criteria 
The criteria listed below shall be used to determine whether a patient is eligible for 
entry into the trial.  The patient must meet all inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the 
study.  In other words, all inclusion criteria must be answered “yes” for the patient to 
be eligible for the study. 
1. Patient has had a cryptogenic, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack 
(TIA), of presumed embolic etiology, verified by a neurologist within 180 days 
prior to randomization, meeting either criteria a or b: 
a) Patient has a diagnosis of ischemic stroke (clinical symptoms persisting 
≥24 hours).   
    OR 
b) Patient has a diagnosis of TIA (clinical symptoms persisting <24 hours) 
and has MRI evidence of infarction. For MRI-incompatible patients (i.e., 
patients that are claustrophobic and/or have implants that are 
contraindicated for MR) a CT scan of the brain will be accepted. 
2. Patient is diagnosed with a patent foramen ovale (PFO), confirmation of which is 
achieved by [CONTACT_246469] (TEE) with bubble study 
demonstrating spontaneous right- to-left shunting or right- to-left shunting during 
Valsalva maneuver.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  Page [ADDRESS_536649] 18 years and less than 60 years of age (subjects cannot have 
reached their 60th birthday prior to randomization/enrollment). 
5. Patient has vascular imaging that rules out other potential sources of cerebral 
thromboembolism (e.g., dissection of the aorta or neck vessels, carotid stenosis 
> 50% and/or presence of ulcerated plaques, or intracranial stenosis > 50%). 
6. Patient has no evidence of hypercoagulable state, which requires 
anticoagulation therapy.  This determination will be based on the evaluation of, 
at a minimum: platelet count, Prothrombin Time (PT) or International Normalized 
Ratio (INR), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT), and 
Antiphospholipid Antibodies.  All test results are to be evaluated based on the 
laboratory normals established at the institution.  A thorough history of 
thromboembolic events in first degree family members must be obtained for all 
patients.  For patients who have a first degree family member with such an 
event prior to age 55, or whose family history is unknown, the following 
additional tests are required and must be interpreted as normal:  Factor V 
Leiden mutation, Prothrombin Gene G20210A mutation, protein C, protein S, 
and Antithrombin III.    
7. Patient is willing and capable of complying with the study protocol requirements, 
including the specified follow-up period, and can be contact[CONTACT_5143]. 
8. Patient or patient’s legal representative (or person designated acceptable under 
local Ethics Committee requirements) is willing to provide written informed 
consent prior to enrollment in study.

months after randomization. 
15. Patient has contraindication to study medications, including antiplatelet therapy. 
16. Patient requires chronic anticoagulation therapy that cannot be discontinued 
prior to randomization, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. Testing for 
prothrombotic disorders may be performed at the discretion of the treating 
physicians but is not required for this study.  
17. Patient is currently participating in another clinical device or drug trial that has 
not completed its primary endpoint or that will clinically confound the current 
study endpoints or does not permit subjects to participate in other studies.

screening evaluations, during the PFO closure procedure that may confound 
detection of device-related adverse events. 
23. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], patient has anatomic criteria identified during 
the screening evaluation and/or the screening transesophageal echocardiogram 
(TEE) that are unfavorable for successful placement of the GORE® HELEX®

contraindications for device placement, which may include: 
 Inability to accommodate a 10 Fr delivery catheter 
 The need for trans-septal puncture 
 Requires placement of more than one  device 
 PFO estimated to be too large for successful device placement 
 Device would impi[INVESTIGATOR_424506](s)

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  Page [ADDRESS_536651] Investigator or designee for initial study eligibility.  
Patients who meet the initial criteria for entry (i.e., previous cryptogenic stroke or imaging-
confirmed TIA and the presence of PFO with right-to-left shunting) will be informed of his/her 
potential eligibility.  An Investigator or designee will discuss the clinical study with the patient 
including risks, benefits, and required follow-up procedures before obtaining informed consent.  
(See Appendix F for the Informed Consent Form  template.)   
 
The patient will be required to read and sign an Informed Consent Form prior to completing 
study-related tests and procedures.  A legal representative (or legal guardian or person 
designated acceptable under local Ethics Committee requirements) may provide consent if the 
patient is unable to do so.  Patients with a signed Informed Consent will be scheduled for 
screening evaluation.   
 
Patients who consent will complete the screening tests and procedures (e.g. vascular imaging, 
neurologic assessments, ECG, and blood tests) within 180 days of the qualifying stroke or TIA 
and prior to final determination of study entrance (e.g., meeting all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria) by [CONTACT_737].   
 
The following will be included in the overall screening evaluation: 
 Initial eligibility assessment, to include confirmation of  
o previous cryptogenic stroke or imaging-confirmed TIA  
 All patients must have a brain MRI obtained for future comparison.   
 For patients with a diagnosis of TIA, MRI must be positive for 
infarction. 
 For patients with CT evidence of infarction a MRI must also be obtained as 
part of the baseline screening assessments. 
 For MRI-incompatible patients only (i.e., patients that are 
claustrophobic and/or have metal implants that are contraindicated 
for MR) a CT scan of the brain will be accepted. 
o presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with positive bubble study utilizing 
transesophageal echocardiography TEE demonstrating  spontaneous right- to-left 
shunting or right- to-left shunting during Valsalva maneuver 
o absence of left atrial appendage thrombus or other mural thrombus during the TEE 
 Physical examination 
 MRA, MRI, CTA, duplex color Doppler, carotid ultrasound,  transcranial Doppler (TCD), or 
conventional angiography of the head, neck, and aortic arch (aortic arch may also be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_424522]) 
 ECG  
 Obtain patient demographics 
 Record patient’s medical history 
 Neurologic assessments performed by [CONTACT_424523], or  designee, qualified 
to score NIHSS and modified Rankin Scales, to include all of the following

TMPLT 07- 11-19 PROT 
o Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 
o National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and 
o Supplemental neurologic examination (captures assessments not gathered by [CONTACT_424524] a Neurologist Investigator only) 
 Blood pressure  
 Laboratory Evaluations 
o Blood drawn for determination of hypercoagulable state by [CONTACT_737], to 
include, but not limited to: 
 Platelet count 
 Prothrombin Time (PT) or International Normalized Ratio (I NR) 
 Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 
 Antiphospholipid Antibodies 
 Additional testing for patients who have a first degree family member with a 
history of thromboembolic events prior to age 55, or whose family history is 
unknown: 
 Factor V Leiden Mutation 
 Prothrombin Gene G20210A Mutation 
 Protein C 
 Protein S 
 Antithrombin III   
o Pregnancy test (if applicable) 
 
The MRI scan must include Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequencing and 
diffusion-weighted images (transverse and coronal planes, with 5 mm or thinner section 
thicknesses recommended, and no gaps) of the brain to detect and record any evidence of 
clinical and/or silent lesions.  This MRI will serve as the screening image for later comparison 
with a follow-up image at [ADDRESS_536652].  For MRI-
incompatible patients (i.e., patients that are claustrophobic and/or have metal implants that are 
contraindicated for MR) a CT scan of the brain will be accepted.  An independent Core Lab will 
be utilized to compare all MRI and CT screening scans with recurrent event or 24-month scans 
for determination of endpoints.   
 
In addition, a vascular examination of the head, neck, and aortic arch must have been 
performed using one or more of the following diagnostic tools: magnetic resonance 
angiography (MRA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography angiography 
(CTA), duplex color Doppler, carotid ultrasound, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, and/or 
conventional angiography to rule out other potential sources of emboli in the systemic 
circulation.  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may also be used for the evaluation of 
the aortic arch.

3.6. Screen Failures 
Patients who consent to participate in the study, but who are not randomized to treatment, or 
who withdraw consent prior to randomization will be considered screen failures  and will not 
be followed in this study.  Screen failures will be entered in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system.    
 
3.7. Randomization and Enrollment 
Upon completion of screening tests and confirmation of study eligibility, consented patients will 
be randomized  to a treatment arm.  Using the EDC database approved by [CONTACT_1034], the 
patient will be assigned to a treatment arm in the study.  Patients will have a 2- in-[ADDRESS_536653] (device) arm.   
 
Because of the inclusion criteria of prior cryptogenic stroke, patients may have already initiated 
antiplatelet medical therapy prior to randomization.  All patients will be instructed to continue 
antiplatelet medical therapy or begin antiplatelet medical therapy, according to the regimen 
prescribed in this protocol and upon instruction of their Neurologist Investigator.   
 
For all patients randomized, if the subject has already initiated antiplatelet medical therapy 
prior to randomization, treatment should continue based on the antiplatelet regimen prescribed 
in this protocol (see Section 3.9 – Initiation and Administration of Antiplatelet Therapy).  If 
antiplatelet medical therapy is not in progress or a regimen change is required, treatment 
should commence promptly (within 48 hours of randomization).   
 
Patients randomized to the test (device) arm must be treated (have a PFO closure attempt) 
within 90 days of randomization.   
 
Patients are considered “ subjects ” enrolled in the study following randomization to a 
treatment arm.  A patient is considered enrolled  into the clinical study when: 
 he/she signs the consent form, and 
 he/she completes all required screening tests and evaluations, and 
 he/she meets inclusion/exclusion criteria, and  
 he/she is randomized to a treatment arm.

care or physician discretion.   
 
3.10.4. Procedure 
Subjects will undergo percutaneous transcatheter PFO closure with the GORE® 
HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  (or alternative 
closure method if closure with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® 
CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  cannot be achieved).  The procedure starts upon 
venous cannulation and the procedure ends upon removal of the final catheter.  
Procedure start and stop times will be recorded for this study. 
 
Anesthesia times, whether general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and 
fluoroscopy times will be recorded during the procedure.  Anesthesia starts when th e 
subject is intubated and stops when the subject is extubated.  Sedation starts at the 
time of intravenous (IV) administration and stops when the subject becomes 
responsive (or termination of subject monitoring).  Fluoroscopy time is the total 
fluoroscopy exposure time recorded during the procedure. 
 
The Investigator should follow the Instructions for Use (IFU) of the GORE® HELEX® 
Septal Occluder / GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  (see Appendix E: 
Instructions for Use) when performing this procedure.  (Note: Protamine is not to be 
given to reverse heparin).   
Subjects who have a delivery attempt with the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder /  
GORE® CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  but whose PFO cannot be closed with the 
device (e.g., closed with an alternative occluder device, surgery, or no closure) will be 
considered technical failures.  Subjects who are technical failures will remain in the 
study and should be followed per the protocol based on the original treatment 
assignment received (reference Section 3.[ADDRESS_536658]-
Randomization). 
 
3.10.5. Post-Device Placement Echocardiogram 
Post-device-placement echocardiograms [TEE or intracardiac echocardiography 
(ICE)] should be performed in the catheterization laboratory during the original 
procedure and in accordance with the Echocardiographic Core Laboratory (Echo 
Core Lab) guidelines to check for complications and possible residual shunting.  
Following device placement, the Investigator should evaluate the subject for the 
presence of any residual shunting using bubble contrast.

A subject may withdraw from the clinical study at any time and should notify the Investigator in 
this event.  If a subject refuses to return for the follow-up visits, the Investigator will attempt to 
obtain at least vital status and complete the Stroke-Free Questionnaire.  If the Stroke-Free 
Questionnaire suggests a possible event, then records and images will be requested for 
adjudication in the same manner as all suspected endpoints.  In the event of subject death, a 
death certificate or autopsy report should be obtained to confirm cause of death and reported 
on the Subject Completion / Discontinuation Form. 
 
A subject will be considered lost to follow- up and discontinued from the study when both of the 
following criteria have been met: the subject has missed two consecutive follow-up visits, and 
the Investigator has documented three failed attempts to contact [CONTACT_423].  One of the three 
documented attempts must include a certified (traceable) letter.  The Investigator will ensure 
that the appropriate CRF (Study Completion / Discontinuation Form) is completed, 
documenting the subject’s discontinuation ( i.e., lost to follow- up) from the clinical study.   If a 
subject is considered lost to follow- up, the Investigator will attempt to obtain vital status and 
complete the Stroke-Free Questionnaire annually from the point of last contact.   Any 
information collected after the time of discontinuation should be captured in the study 
database under an Unscheduled visit.   
 
The Investigator may also withdraw the subject from the clinical study at any time based on 
the Investigator’s medical judgment.   
 
The study Monitor will ensure that subject withdrawals are documented properly, discussed 
with the Investigator, and reported to the Sponsor (ISO [ZIP_CODE] – 1:2003, Section 9.1(j.).   
 
3.19. Imaging Analysis 
3.19.1. MRI / CT 
For all subjects, an independent MRI Core Laboratory will compare the screening 
MRI with the 24 month follow-up or recurrent event MRI for a determination of study 
imaging endpoints.   
 
Variables assessed by [CONTACT_424530]: 
 Screening lesion evaluation 
 Change in focal lesion on follow-up scan

Variables assessed by [CONTACT_424531]: 
 Residual shunting, as determined by [CONTACT_424532]  
 Residual shunting, as determined by [CONTACT_424533] 
 Thrombus on device 
 
Residual shunt will be evaluated based on maximum number of agitated saline or 
microbubble particles seen in the left atrial chamber in any single frame during first 
three cardiac cycles, during a resting state or during/after Valsalva maneuver.  The 
scale for measuring the significance of the shunt is as follows: 
     
Occluded =  0 particles  
Trivial or small =  1 – 5 particles  
Moderate =  6 – 25 particles  
Large =  > 25 particles  
 
Echocardiography Guidelines are provided for reference by [CONTACT_424534] D – Echocardiography

4. Adverse Events 
This study will adhere to current ISO requirements and 21 CFR 812, regarding the definitions and 
reporting of adverse events (AEs) .  Adverse events  (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject.   
 
An adverse device effect  (ADE) is an untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  
This includes ADEs resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the Instructions for Use (IFU), 
the deployment of the device, or any response that is a result of a user error (in accordance with the 
current ISO standard) 
 
The severity of an AE or ADE will be rated as follows: 
 Mild – subject is aware of event or symptom, but event/symptom is easily tolerated. 
 Moderate  -  subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce their usual level 
of activity 
 Severe – significant impairment of functioning; subject is unable to carry out usual activities  
 
Adverse events or adverse device effects are anticipated, but usually are not expected (i.e., not 
previously reported in relation to the study device; expected events are those that are referred to in 
the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, consent form, or IFU when applicable). 
 
All AEs will be recorded on the appropriate internet case report form (CRF) and documented in the 
subject’s permanent medical record.  The CRFs to be used for data collection during the study are in 
Appendix B: Case Report Forms .  All AEs will be reported to the FDA, the IRBs and ECs, 
Competent Authorities per local requirements, participating Investigators, and/or safety monitoring 
boards via annual study progress updates.  (in accordance with the current ISO standard) 
 
4.1. Anticipated Adverse Events

5.1. Protocol Deviations and Violations 
A protocol deviation  occurs when, without significant consequences or impact on the study, 
the activities during a study depart from the IRB-approved or Ethics Committee-approved 
protocol.  For example, if a subject misses a visit window because he/she is traveling, this 
departure from the protocol does not have a serious impact on the scientific soundness of the 
clinical study or study data.   
 
The Investigator will report protocol deviations to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_424539] (Form 24) and, if required, to the local reviewing IRB or EC.  The 
Sponsor will determine the effect of the protocol deviation on the scientific soundness of the 
clinical study and subject safety and determine if additional reports are required.

6.1. Minimization of Risks 
Potential risks associated with the use of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® 
CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  or the study medications may be minimized by [CONTACT_424542]: 
 Investigator and staff training will be conducted to share information regarding design of 
the device, its application, and preliminary clinical results from any pre-clinical and clinical 
studies. 
 Investigators will be reminded of the importance of complex anatomies when using the 
device. 
 Investigators will be reminded of the importance of monitoring subjects on antiplatelet 
medications 
 
An evaluation will be completed by [CONTACT_424543]/exclusion criteria before study entry to ensure the subject’s medical and anatomical 
status is appropriate.  Procedural angiography will be used to assess the morphology of the 
heart and the characteristics of the PFO. 
 
Antiplatelet therapy will be administered to reduce the risk of thrombosis. 
Procedural anticoagulation therapy will be administered to reduce thromboembolic risk.  
(Note:  Protamine is not to be given to reverse heparin).  Subjects will be assessed at 
discharge and periodically during the follow-up period.   
 
Evaluations will include, but will not be limited to, physical examination performed by [CONTACT_424544]/or the Cardiologist Investigator , neurologic assessments, and 
transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (TTE or TEE). 
 
The Investigator or designee will evaluate the subject for device-related events or AEs related 
to the procedure or medical treatment. 
 
Data submitted from the investigative sites will be monitored.  An initiation site visit and interim 
site visit(s) will be conducted as appropriate to evaluate protocol compliance, accuracy, and 
subject safety. 
 
Safety data obtained during the clinical study will be shared with the Investigators to aid 
understanding of the device and potential complications associated with its use. 
 
All echos performed will be reviewed by [CONTACT_424545]. 
 
A DSMB and CEC will be utilized to further mitigate risk to subjects during the study.  
 
6.2. Expected Benefits  
A major expected benefit from the use of the GORE® HELEX® Septal Occluder / GORE® 
CARDIOFORM Septal Occluder  is the reduction of risk from recurrent embolic (stroke or TIA) 
events when compared with antiplatelet medical therapy alone.

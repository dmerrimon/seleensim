Study Summary 
and Overview  This is a prospective, phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study to assess the 
safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of CSL312 in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
For all enrolled subjects, informed consent must be obtained at the 
Screening Visit before any study- specific assessments are 
performed. Screening can occur between 1 and 28 days before Day 1. For this study, Baseline is defined as before dosing on 
Day 1. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to e nter the Treatment and 
Observation Period for 14 weeks, during which subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) loading dose of CSL312 or placebo followed by 3 subcutaneous (SC) doses of CSL312 or placebo. A total of 12 study visits are planned (1 Screening  Visit and 11  visits 
during the Treatment and Observation Period). A final safety check will be conducted by [CONTACT_85790] [ADDRESS_628765] has completed th e 14-week Treatment and 
Observation Period and the Follow-up Visit (Telephone Call). 
Primary Objective  The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety of 
CSL312 in subjects with IPF.

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  Statistical Analyses  The sample size for this study was determined based on feasibility, 
not based on a power calculation. It was estimated that enrolling approximately 80 subjects (40 in each treatment group), and taking into account a 12% dropout rate, a total of 70 evaluable subjects 
(35 in each treatmen t group), would be considered sufficient for 
assessment of safety, PK, and biomarker profiles. 
The primary endpoints of this study are subjects experiencing 
TEAEs including SAEs, AESIs, CSL312- induced ADAs, and 
clinically significant abnormalities in labor atory assessments that 
are reported as AEs. The summary measures will be the number and proportion of subjects experiencing these safety events after treatment with investigational product (CSL312 or placebo). 
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_489209] ≥  1 TEAE and the number of events. TEAEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_489210].  
More detailed information on the analyses of efficacy, safety, PK, 
PD, and biomarkers  are provided in the full clinical study protocol.

1.1 Background  
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of chronic, progressive, fibrosing interstitial 
pneumonia of unknown etiology that occurs primarily in older adults and is limited to the lungs. IPF is associated with the histopathological and / or radiological pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia [ Raghu et al, 2011; Raghu et al, 2018]. A pattern of usual interstitial 
pneumonia typi[INVESTIGATOR_489179] a distinguishing feature with or without peripheral traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis. In addition, subpl eural, 
basal -predominant reticular abnormalities and ground-glass opacification are often present 
[Raghu et al, 2018].  
Previously, IPF was considered to be a predominantly an inflammatory disease [ Scadding et 
al, 1967; Katzenstein et al, 1998; Crystal et al, 1984; Ryu et al, 1998]. However, recently there has been a shift in thinking regarding IPF pathogenesis from an inflammatory driven 
process to a primarily fibrotic one, in which fibrogenesis results from repetitive local 
micro -injuries to an aging alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. These micro -injuries initiate aberrant 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]-fibroblast communication, the induction of matrix-producing myofibroblasts, and extracellular matrix accumulation and remodeling of the lung interstitium [ Richeldi et al, 
2017; Sgalla et al, 2018; Martinez et al, 2017 ]. Nevertheless, inflammation appears to be a 
prominent feature in the lungs of patients with IPF [ Bringardner et al, 2008] and may 
contribute the rate of disease progression [ Balestro et al, 2016 ; Kahloon et al, 2013]. A severe 
innate and adaptive inflammatory infiltrate is observed in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_489180] [ Balestro et al, 2016 ]. Differences in 
the expression of inflammatory markers and autoantibodies have been shown to be a ssociated 
with different clinical outcomes in patients with IPF [ Kahloon et al, 2013; Gilani et al, 2010; 
Prasse et al, 2009 ; Shinoda et al, 2009; Collard et al, 2007; dePi[INVESTIGATOR_489181], 2015; Nicholson et 
al, 2002; Moore et al, 2014; Taille et al, 2011 ]. 
IPF is one of the most common forms of idiopathic interstitial lung disease (ILD) [ Kim et al, 
2015] and several genetic and environmental risk factors for the disease have been identified. 
These includ e male sex, older age, cigarette smoking, environmental exposures such as metal 
and wood dusts, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic viral infections such as 
Epstein -Barr virus and hepatitis C, and a family history of ILD [ Raghu et al, 2011; Raghu et 
al, 2018; Sgalla et al, 2018].

  Effective Date: Week commencing [ADDRESS_628789], and digital clubbing is present in approximately 30% of patients [ Richeldi 
et al, 2017; Raghu et al, 2018]. The natural history of IPF is highly variable and the course of 
disease in an individual patient is difficult to predict [ Kim et al, 2015]. For some patients, 
disease progress occurs relatively slowly; others have a rapid decline in lung function leading 
to death; and a portion of patients suffer a stepwise loss of lung function with periods of 
relative stability [ Kim et al, 2015]. Progression of IPF is characterized by a decline in lung 
function, worsening symptoms of dyspnea and cough, and deterioration in quality of life [Quinn et al, 2019]. For patients with IPF, acute exacerbations in respi[INVESTIGATOR_489182] [ Collard et al, 2016]. The 
evidence suggests that up to 46% of deaths in patients with IPF are preceded by [CONTACT_489211], with a median survival of approximately 3 to 4 months in these patients [Collard et al, 2016]. Although the course of IPF may be variable, its overall prognosis is 
poor, with a median survival after diagnosis of only 3 to 4 years in patients who do not receive antifibrotic therapy or undergo lung transplant [ Quinn et al, 2019].  
Many patients with IPF have comorbid conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, depression, 
GERD, and ischemic heart disease [ Caminati et al, 2019 ; Raghu et al, 2015a ]. Comorbid 
conditions may affect the disease course in patients with IPF [ Raghu et al, 2011], although in 
most of these patients the cause of death is IPF itself (ie, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) [ Kim et al, 
2015].  
Two antifibrotic medications, nintedanib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], are approved in most countries for 
the treatment of IPF. These drugs received conditional recommendation for use in the latest international treatment guideline for IPF [ Raghu et al, 2015b]. Both drugs reduce the rate of 
decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) compared with placebo over time, c onsistent with 
slowing the progression of the disease [ Raghu et al, 2015a ; Quinn et al, 2019]. However, 
neither drug significantly improves the patient’s quality of life [ Quinn et al, 2019; Graney 
and Lee, 2018 ].

and other ILDs. This claim is supported by [CONTACT_489212], tissue factor, coagulation factor  VIII (FVIII), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
(PAI-1) within animal models of lung fibrosis and in patients with IPF [ Fujimoto et al, 2003; 
Navaratnam et al, 2014 ; Crooks and Hart, 2015]. Significantly, patients with IPF who 
experience acute exacerbations have correlating elevated levels of D -dimer, fibrinogen, and 
homocysteine have been reported in both subjects with stable IPF and subjects with acute 
exacerbations of IPF compared with healthy control subjects [ Bargagli et al, 2014]. 
Fibrin -rich wound clots are the result of the activated coagulation cas cade. The clot can serve 
as a scaffold for fibroblast accumulation and synthesis of extracellular matrix [ Schuliga et al, 
2018]. Furthermore, various proteins from the coagulant and fibrinolytic pathways have been implicate d in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Procoagulant proteins, thrombin, and 
activated coagulation factor  X (FXa) have direct profibrotic activities on lung fibroblasts 
through activation of protease activated receptor  1 (PAR-1) and direct inhibition of these 
proteins attenuated lung fibrosis in vivo [ Howell et al, 2005; Chiu et al, 2008; Scotton et al, 
2009; Shea et al, 2017]. Dabigatran, the direct thrombin inhibitor, was able to inhibit fibroblast differentiation, profibrotic cytokine, collagen production [ Bogatkevich et al, 2009]. 
It also ameliorated the development of bleomycin -induced pulmonar y fibrosis in  vivo and 
demonstrated a good safety profile in a phase 1 clinical study for patients with systemic sclerosis -interstitial lung disease [ Bogatkevich et al, 2011; Silver et al, 2019]. In the 
fibrinolytic system, PAI -[ADDRESS_628791] excess fibrin accumulation and activation of 
profibrogenic actions of fibroblasts, respectively [ Hattori et al, 2000; Senoo et al, 2010; 
Schuliga et al, 2017]. Overall, the evidence suggests that targeting the coagulation, inflammatory, and fibrinolytic pathways may be a potentially viable strategy for treating patients with IPF.

1.2.1 Over view  
The coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor, FXII) is produced in the liver and is secreted 
into the plasma where the glycosylated 80 kDa zymogen circulates with a concentration of ~30 µg/mL and a half-life of 50 to 70 hours [ Bjorkqvist et al, 2014].  FXII can be activated to 
a 2-chain active form, FXIIa (also 80  kDa), following binding to negatively charged artificial 
or biologic surfaces [ Maas and Renne, 2018 ]. Furt her cleavage of FXIIa releases the 30  kDa 
light chain containing the catalytic domain (FXIIa- β), which can activate the classical 
complement pathway [ Ghebrehiwet et al, 1981]. FXIIa initiates coagulation via the 
fibrin -forming intrinsic pathway and promotes inflammation via the bradykinin-producing 
kallikrein -kinin system [ Renne and Stavrou, 2019 ; Maas and Renne, 2018 ]. Binding of 
bradykinin to the kinin B2 recept or activates proinflammatory signaling pathways that dilate 
vessels, induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, and increase vascular permeability [ Renne et al, 
2012]. FXIIa may also modulate components of the complement and fibrinolyt ic systems. 
However, to date, these activities have only been demonstrated in vitro [ Renne and Stavrou, 
2019]. Studies have shown that FXII deficient animals are protected from thrombosis without impaired hemostasis [ Renne et al, 2005; Kleinschnitz et al, 2006; Matafonov et al, 2014]. 
Similarly, pharmacological targeting of FXII or FXIIa provides protection from thrombosis witho ut an increased incidence of bleeding [ Larsson et al, 2014; Revenko et al, 2011]. 
CSL312, an affinity matured antibody targeting the catalytic domain of FXII, effectively reduced edema in in v ivo models and prevented bradykinin formation following contact 
[CONTACT_489213]- defective plasma samples [ Cao et al, 2018].

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  [IP_ADDRESS]  Evidence for FXII and the Contact [CONTACT_489214]  / myofibroblasts [ Wygrecka et al, 
2015]. FXII binds to lung fibroblast through heparan sulfate proteoglycan and induces 
proliferation, fibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix production [ Wujak et al, 
2015; Hess et al, 2017]. Moreover, transforming growth factor- beta (TGF -β) was found to 
induce p-JNK and translocation of SMAD-3 to the nucleus to upregulate FXII expression [Jablonska et al, 2010].
 Genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of FXII activity 
abrogated fibrogenesis in a bleomycin lung injury model in mice [ Wygrecka et al, 2015]. 
FXII was reported to induce the production and release of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, IL -6, 
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), CXCL motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL -5), and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF) in human precision- cut lung slides in a kallikrein kinin -independent 
manner [ Hess et al, 2017 ]. FXII also has direct effects on endothelial cell proliferation, 
vascular smooth muscle cells, neutrophil activation, monocyte  / macrophage activation and 
associated M2 phenotype induction [ Mahdi et al, 2002; Fernando et al, 2005; LaRusch et al, 
2010; Wang et al, 2010; V orlova et al, 2017; Stavrou et al, 2018]. These cells types have been 
implicated in fibrogenesis. Lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_489183]. The resulting bradykinin production may potentiate 
inflammation in lung disease [ Varano Della Vergiliana et al, 2010 ]. Bradykinin can also 
induce fibroblast cytokine expression and activation [ Hayashi et al, 2000; Sabatini et al, 
2013]. Thus, inhibition of FXII and the contact [CONTACT_489215] a therapeutic

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  1.2.2 Nonclinical Evaluation  
For the ILD  / IPF indication, in vitro studies were performed to support the role of FXII in 
lung fibrogenesis. FXII protein levels were found to be elevated in the lungs of patients with 
IPF when compared with non-disease control lungs. Whole lung RNA sequencing and published single cell RNA sequencing datasets have confirmed that FXII is not made in the lungs or the lung fibroblasts. Collectively, these data suggest that FXII is not produced in the 
lungs and is found when the lung is damaged, causing activation of the pulmonary 
endothelium, increased vascular permeability and increased perfusion into the lung tissue. FXII was found to be significantly elevated the blood of a subset of patients with IPF displaying a progressive decline in lung function. IL-6 has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of lung fibrosis [ Saito et al, 2008; Le et al, 2014; Kobayashi et al, 2015]. 
Activated β -FXIIa -induced IL-6 mRNA expression and protein production from human lung 
fibroblasts and CSL312 inhibited this function in a dose- dependent manner [ Wong et al, 
2017]. This process was found to be mediated through PAR-1 and NF- κB signalling 
pathways. Aside from IL-6, β -FXIIa also significantly increased the release of pro -fibrotic 
cytokines / chemokines (CXCL-1 / growth regulated oncogene- alpha [Gro -α], monocyte 
chemoattractant protein  1 [MCP -1 / C- C motif che mokine ligand (CCL- 2)], IL -8, PAI-1, and 
latent TGF -β from lung fibroblasts a dose-dependent manner. Correspondingly, CSL312 
inhibited CXCL-1, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and PAI-1. β -FXIIa significantly induced the 
proliferation of IPF fibroblasts. β -FXIIa induced  the transition of primary M0 macrophages 
to an M2 phenotype, and IL-6 induced hyperpolarization of M2 macrophages and also stimulated Type  II cytokine (CCL-18, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) 
release from naïve and M2 macrophages. Excessive M2 -associated responses are an 
important part of many fibrotic diseases and are implicated in the aberrant wound-healing 
cascade during fibrosis [ Zhang et al, 2018]. CSL312 inhibited the β -FXIIa -mediated 
migration of primary lung fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. 
Bradykinin, a downstream product of FXII activation is involved in vasodilation and 
inflammation during tissue injury. CSL312 can effectively inhibit bradykinin formation in human plasma following potent FXII activation. Preliminary studies have confirmed that 
bradykinin induces IL-6 in lung fibroblasts, which is mediated through the bradykinin 
receptor -2 subtype.

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  Bioinformatics methods utilizing the transcriptome of  in vitro FXII and CSL312- stimulated 
fibroblasts revealed processes regulated by [CONTACT_254815]312, leading to the identification of a 
FXII / CSL312 gene signature. Preliminary results demonstrate an enrichment of this gene 
signature [CONTACT_489250] (IPF, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, systemic sclerosis -ILD, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis) when compared with 
healthy  / non-fibrotic controls. Stratification of ILD patients based on the FXII signature [CONTACT_489251] (i ncreased disease 
severity). These preliminary findings may provide the potential to guide selection and stratification of ILD patients for treatment with CSL312. Further work is underway to validate and refine the FXII gene signature, examine the signature [CONTACT_489252], and evaluate whether it can be translated into blood to select for CSL312-responsive 
patients.  
In vivo evaluation of 3F7, the parental antibody to CSL312, was assessed in the murine bleomycin lung model of pulmonary fibrosis. The prophylactic or therapeutic administration 
of 3F7 significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as evident by [CONTACT_489217], improved lung function, and reduced expression extracellular matrix proteins. A dditionally, 3F7 inhibited bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis similarly 
to anti- TGF -β monoclonal antibody in benchmarking studies. 3F7 also significantly inhibited 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis and unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced renal  fibrosis in these mouse models. 
Within the framework of the hereditary angioedema (HAE) project the pharmacology 
program was structured to characterize the interaction between CSL312 and FXII zymogen 
and its active forms, as well as the ability of CSL312 to specifically inhibit FXIIa -mediated 
biological activities both in  vitro and in vivo using relevant animal species, ie, mice, rabbits 
and cynomolgus monkeys. 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and the toxicology program supporting the clinical 
development of CSL312 in IPF were performed according to international standards outlined in International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines.

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  Two single-dose PK / pharmacodynamics (PD) studies with CSL312 after IV and / or SC 
administration in cynomolgus monkeys showed prolongation of activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) confirming pharmacological activity of CSL312. Throughout 
both studies, terminal half- life (T 1/2) after IV administration was between 9 and 11  days. 
After SC administration, T 1/2 was b etween 12 and 14 days and bioavailability was calculated 
to be approximately 66%. A single-dose PK study comparing formulations of 100 mg/mL and 
170 mg/mL of CSL312 in rabbits at a SC dose of 20 mg/kg demonstrated a similar PK profile 
for both formulations. 
The CSL312 safety pharmacology and toxicological program demonstrated that at doses of 
up to 100 mg/kg IV and 200 mg/kg SC, CSL312 was well tolerated and had no adverse 
treatment -related effects on safety in mice or cynomolgus monkeys at up to 26 weeks. In the 
4-week repeat -dose toxicity study in mice lower IV doses (3 to 30 mg/kg) revealed adverse 
treatment -related clinical signs and mortality after repeat dosing due to an immunological 
reaction to the human protein CSL312, which has limited predictive value for the clinical situation. In a local tolerance study in rabbits, CSL312 was well tolerated at the injection site. 
In addition, no adverse treatment- related effects were observed in the embryo -fetal 
development, in the fertility studies (1  study for each sex), and in a prenatal and postnatal 
development study in rabbits. Moreover, tissue cross-reactivity was observed on various 
human and cynomolgus monkey tissues; however, no related safety findings were observed 
in cynomolgus monkey repeat-dose toxic ity studies.  
Carcinogenicity assessments based on abovementioned published literature and available 
nonclinical and clinical data concluded that CSL312 has no carcinogenic potential when 
administered to patients.  
In conclusion, nonclinical experiments demonstrate increased FXII protein expression in the damaged IPF lung and contribution to lung fibrogenesis by [CONTACT_489218], migratory capacity and pro- inflammatory  / profibrotic cytokine / chemokine 
release. CSL3 12 inhibited these FXIIa- β-mediated processes. Anti -FXIIa monoclonal 
antibody 3F7 also demonstrated efficacy in ameliorating lung fibrosis in the murine 
bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in the prophylactic and therapeutic setting. CSL312 safety, 
PD, and toxicology studies demonstrated an adequate safety profile supporting a phase 2 
clinical study. Since immunological reactions are principally expected after repeat -dosing of 
heterologous proteins (ie, human proteins in animal species), respective findings observed in

1.2.3 Clinical Experience  
CSL312 is currently being developed for 2 target indications: IPF and HAE. Additionally, 
CSL312 had been under evaluation for the prevention of respi[INVESTIGATOR_489185] 2019 ( COVID-19), but based on the results from a proof-of-conc ept 
study, development was discontinued (refer to the CSL312 IB for additional details). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Healthy Subjects  
In healthy subjects, a phase 1 study has been completed and another is ongoing. 
Study CSL312_1001, a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
single-ascending dose study was conducted in healthy volunteers. During this study, the safety, tolerability, and PK of escalating doses of CSL312 were assessed after single IV 
or SC injections of up to 10 mg/kg in healthy male subjects. CSL312 had a n acceptable 
safety and tolerability profile. During the study there were no serious adverse events 
(SAEs); no withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs); no thromboembolic events (TEEs), bleeding events, or cases of anaphylaxis; no clinically significant abnormal 
trends in hematology or clinical chemistry assessments. After SC doses, the time to 
reach maximum observed plasma concentration (T
max) was approximately 7 days. The 
majority of the AEs were of mild severity. Injection site reactions were more common with SC CSL312 than SC placebo, but there was no apparent dose dependence. 
Additionally, CSL312 exhibited linear PK with a T
1/2 of approximately 18 days after the 
SC injection. The study results are described in greater detail in the CSL312 IB. 
Additionally, a phase 1, single ascending dose study to investigate the PK, PD, safety, and 
tolerability of CSL312 in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects (CSL312_1003) is 
ongoing. Preliminary data from this study are not yet available.

Three clinical studies assessing CSL312 are currently ongoing in subjects with HAE; 
one pha se 2 study and two phase 3 studies. 
Study CSL312_2001 
CSL312_2001 is an ongoing multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled, parallel -arm, 
phase 2 dose-ranging (75, 200, and 600 mg) study to investigate the efficacy, PK, and safety 
of CSL312 SC administered every 4 weeks (Q4W) as prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in 
subjects with C1 -esterase inhibitor  (C1-INH) HAE or FXII  / plasminogen HAE. The study 
consists of a Screening Period, a Run-in Period, 2 treatment periods (Treatment Period  1 
[2 parts: 1  double-blind portion and 1 open-label portion] and open- label Treatment 
Period  2), and a Follow-up Period. After the Run- in Period, eligible subjects with C1 -INH 
HAE were randomized to 1  of 4 treatment groups (placebo, or 75, 200, or 600 mg CSL312) 
in double-bli nd Treatment Period  1. Subjects received a single IV loading dose of 
investigational product followed [ADDRESS_628793] Q4W for 12 weeks (for a total of 13 weeks). In the open-label portion (Treatment 
Period  2), subjects receive a single SC injection of CSL312 at a dose of either 200 or 600 mg 
Q4W. The study is currently ongoing and the randomized, double-blinded portion of Treatment Period  1 has been completed.  
A total of 32 patients with C1 -INH (type  1 or type 2) HAE were enrolled in the randomized 
double-blind treatment groups of Treatment Period [ADDRESS_628794] frequent AEs were nonserious injection site reactions (ie, injection site erythema, pruritus, swelling, and discomfort) that were mild or moderate in severity. No related SAEs or adverse events of special interest (AESIs; TEEs, abnormal bleeding, or severe 
hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis events) were reported.

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  During the study, nearly two -thirds of subjects experienced ≥  1 TEAE (64.1% 
[75 / 117] subjects, 303 events); a smaller percentage in the CSL312 group experienced 
TEAEs compared with the placebo group (60.3% vs. 67.8%). Few TEAEs were considered 
treatment -related (5  events in 4  subjects [3.4%]) and the percentages were similar for the 
CSL312 and placebo groups (3 events in 2 subjects [3.4%] vs. 2 events in 2  subjects [3.4%]). 
All 3 related TEAEs in the CSL312 group ([ADDRESS_628797] increased and  1 patient experienced 1 AE of hemiparesis [left -sided weakness]) were 
non-serious, mild in intensity and resolved within one day after onset. 
One-third of subjects (33.3%; 39 /117) experienced SAEs (83 events). The percentage of 
subjects with SAEs was sim ilar for the CSL312 and placebo groups (34.5% vs. 32.2%), 
although the number of reported SAEs was lower for the CSL312 group (38 vs. 45 events). 
Only [ADDRESS_628798], who was in the placebo group, experienced a treatment- related SAE of 
bilateral deep vein throm bosis (DVTs) that was reported as a suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) and also as an AESI.  
During the study, 11 subjects experienced a total of 19 AESIs; [ADDRESS_628799],

Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 
• CSL312 600 mg SC Q4W  
• Placebo SC Q4W  
One week before the first SC dose of investigational product, an IV loading dose that is half 
of the SC maintenance dose will be administered and the date of the IV loading dose will be 
considered Day  1 of study. 
The overall objective of the study is to establish a proof of m echanism and generate 
additional human data to support decision-making for further development of CSL312 for the 
treatment of patients with IPF.  
The study has the following specific objectives: 
• To investigate the safety of CSL312 in patients with IPF 
• To ch aracterize the systemic PK of CSL312 in patients with IPF  
• To investigate the effect of CSL312 on FXII-related pathways and on a validated clinical endpoint (FVC) in patients with IPF  
• To further investigate the association of FXII- related anti -fibrotic path ways 
(contact  / coagulation, inflammation, and fibroblast function) with IPF clinical 
features and biomarkers of lung structural damage and IPF pathogenesis 
1.[ADDRESS_628802]. The benefits of treatment with CSL312 in patients 
with IPF are unknown. Subjects randomly assigned to the placebo group are not expected to 
receive any benefits related to their IPF disease from participating in this study.

  Effective Date: Week commencing [ADDRESS_628803] been considered based on the anticipated effects 
of the proposed mechanism of action and known risks associated with drugs of the same or 
similar class. The following events constitute potentially important medical risks: 
• Severe hypersensitivity  including anaphylaxis:  Administration of therapeutic prote ins 
including monoclonal antibodies such as CSL312 may be associated with the risk of 
hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, some of which can be serious and 
life-threatening. To date, no severe hypersensitivity or anaphylactic-type reactions have 
been observed after repeated administration of CSL312 in the completed or ongoing 
clinical studies. Nevertheless, administration of CSL312 will be performed at the study site under medical supervision, with immediate access to emergency equipment and 
medicat ion for the treatment of severe hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis. Subjects 
will be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis, and 
will be encouraged to report any symptoms to site personnel. 
• Abnormal bleeding and thromboembolic events:  By [CONTACT_489219], CSL312 may be 
associated with a potential risk of bleeding or TEEs, due to altered hemostasis, unstable 
clot formation, or impaired  clot breakdown. In addition, due to the pharmacological 
action of CSL312, a concentration-dependent prolongation of aPTT was observed with 
dosages similar to those proposed in this study. Clinical experience with CSL312 in study 
CSL312_1001 and CSL312_2001 did not show an effect on prothrombin time (PT). This is consistent with the observation that patients who have a congenital deficiency of FXII do not exhibit a bleeding phenotype, despi[INVESTIGATOR_79615] a prolonged aPTT [ Lammle et al, 
1991; Ratnoff and Colopy, 1955]. In addition, nonclinical studies in mice and rabbits showed no impairment in hemostasis after inhibition of FXIIa [ Larsson et al, 2014]. 
Nevertheless, sub jects will be monitored carefully for any signs of thrombosis or bleeding 
during the study. 
• Immunogenicity (anti -drug antibodies):  All protein therapeutics are potentially 
immunogenic. Because CSL312 is a protein, it has the potential to cause the developm ent 
of ADAs. During the study, investigators will monitor subjects for the development of ADAs for clinical evaluation of any signs of immunogenicity.

  Effective Date: Week commencing [ADDRESS_628807] shown that FXII contributes to lung fibrosis by [CONTACT_489221] [ Wong et al, 2017]. In  vitro studies conducted

Furthermore, repeat administration of 3F7, the parental antibody to CSL312, at 20 mg/kg as 
either a prophylactic or a therapeutic treatment regimen significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Taken together, these results support the rationale to develop CSL312 as a therapeutic option for the treatment of IPF. Although it is 
known that IPF is a m ulti-factorial disease, it is assumed that inhibiting FXIIa -mediated 
kallikrein activity to a particular percent target inhibition may inhibit inflammatory and 
fibrotic mediators involved in the disease process in IPF. 
3.3.[ADDRESS_628809] SC dose, an IV loading dose that is half of the SC maintenance dose will be administered.  
Dose selection was based on the safety, PK, and PD data obtained from the phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (CSL312_1001) and the phase 2 study in subjects with HAE (CSL312_2001). Results from previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and subjects with HAE showed that a single administration of CSL312 at a dose of up to 10 mg/kg both 
IV and SC (CSL312_1001) and repeated SC administration of CSL312 at doses of up to 
600 mg (CSL312_2001) were safe and well tolerated. In Study CSL312_1001, CSL312 exhibited linear PK when administered as a single IV infusion or SC injection with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%, and a T
1/2 of approximately 18 days after the 
SC injection. Dose-dependent PK was observed in C max and area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve (AUC) after repeated SC administration in Study CSL312_2001. To 
date, no difference in the PK of CSL312 was noted between healthy volunteers and subjects with HAE.

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  A PK  / PD model was developed to quantify the relationship between CSL312 plasma 
concentrations and FXIIa- mediated kallikrein activity from Studies CSL31 2_1001 (healthy 
volunteers) and CSL312_2001 (patients with HAE). The modeled relationship showed an 
increase in inhibition of FXIIa-mediated kallikrein activity with increasing concentrations of CSL312. 
The IV loading dose was considered for this study to immediately achieve and maintain 
approximate steady -state exposures (ie, C
max, Ctrough, AUC) during the proposed 3-month 
Treatment and Observation Period. With an IV loading dose, 73% of patients are projected to 
be above the median steady- state C trough (Ctrough,ss ) at the end of the first SC dosing interval. 
Simulations from the final healthy volunteer / HAE patient PK  / PD model showed that a 
fixed dose of 600 mg SC Q4W would achieve a median percent inhibition of FXIIa- mediated 
kallikrein activity of ≥  90% at the nadir during the SC dosing interval.

estimate is based on:  
• Screening  / Washout Period of up to 28 days 
• 14-week Treatment and Observation Period 
• Follow-up Telephone Call at [ADDRESS_628811] administration 
The overall study duration (ie, first subject’s Screening Visit to last subject’s Follow-up Telephone call) will be approximately 17 to 19 months. 
3.5 Planned  Number of Subjects  
The study will enroll approximately 80 subjects to achieve a total of 70  evaluable subjects by

should be resumed or whether the temporary halt should continue. The study can be resumed on the recommendation of CSL’s Global Safety Committees, in agreement with the IDMC, if the safety assessment concludes that no further study modifications, protocol amendments, or risk mitigation measures are necessary, and that it is safe to resume the study. Regulatory 
authorities and the institutional review board (IRB) will be notified of the temporary halt and 
subsequent resumption of the study. A substantial protocol amendment will be submitted to the regulatory authorities and the IRB for approval if the safety assessment concludes that modifications to the clinical study protocol (CSP), including addition of new risk mitigation 
measures, are required to  resume the study. If necessary, ad-hoc unblinding procedures may 
be initiated according to CSL’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for further safety 
assessment. If the risk assessment concludes that continued dosing poses an unacceptable risk to subjects and no further risk mitigation steps can be applied, the CSL Global Safety 
Committees will be involved in recommending a study stop. Regulators and the independent 
ethics committee (IEC) will be notified of a study stop.

Screen failures are defined as individuals who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
who do not meet the eligibility criteria for participation in the study (see Section  4.1). A 
minimal set of information including demography, eligibility criteria, laboratory results, 
screening failure details, and any SAE should be recorded for all individuals considered 
screen failures.  
Subjects who do not meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria wi thin the specified time limit of 
28 days and fail to complete screening assessments, may be re-screened but only once, if approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor.
 
Subjects who are not eligible for enrollment because laboratory test results do not meet the 
inclusion / exclusion criteria may have laboratory testing repeated, but once only, if the 
results are thought to represent a laboratory error or a reversible or a clinically insignificant intermittent condition. If testing is repeated, all Screening ass essments will need to be 
repeated with the exception the 12- lead ECG, which may be repeated separately from other 
assessments, as necessary. The Sponsor’s medical monitor may also grant permission for tests to be repeated separately from other tests as necessary. If inclusion / exclusion criteria are not met based on the results of the repeated tests, the subject should be considered a screen 
failure and not be enrolled in the study. Repeat tests should be conducted and the results 
available within [ADDRESS_628824] will be asked to sign a new ICF.

6.3.1 Blinding Method  
Investigational site staff, including the investigators, will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
Subjects and CSL staff  / designates participating in the conduct of the study, with the 
exception of IRT and Clinical Trial Supply staff at CSL, will also be blinded to treatment allocation (double-blind). 
To maintain the blind, all doses of investigational product administered during the Treatment 
and Observation Period will be volume normalized (see Section  5). V olume normalization 
will permit administration of the same volume of investigational product to be administered to each subject, regardless of their treatment assignment.  
After preparation of the investigational product and before the investigational product is delivered to the subject for administration, a physical blind (eg, opaque or colored syringe) will be employed so that other site staff and study subjects are unable to detect any

documents, and the investigator must follow the defined procedures provided in the study 
reference manuals. The subject’s treatment allocation should not be recorded in the subject’s source document. 
6.3.3 Planned Unblinding Procedures  
Periodic unblinded safety reviews are planned for this study for the purposes of safety monitoring activities by [CONTACT_31849]. With authorization by [CONTACT_254815], the IRT will provide either the unblinded statistician performing analyses for the IDMC with the randomization code or 
an IRT user account to obtain the required information directly from the IRT. 
At the end of the study, CSL will authorize that the study be unblinded after database lock. 
The randomization codes will be provided to the study statistician (or delegate). 
6.3.4 Ad-hoc Safety Unbinding  
CSL’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) personnel may, on an ad-hoc basis, unblind the randomization code directly in the IRT at any time during the study, because of a safety concern. The purpose of the unblinded data review is to determine if there is a risk to subject safety that would require further action either for the individual 
management of a study subject or for the ongoing conduct of the study. The need to unblind a 
subject or group of subjects may not necessarily arise because of an SAE. The need to unblind on an ad-hoc basis will be determined by [CONTACT_254815]’s GCSP senior leadership.

8.1.2 Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  
Data on acute exacerbations will be collected. An acute exacerbation of IPF is an acute, clinically significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_489195] [ Collard et al, 2016]. The median survival of patients with IPF who 
experience an acu te exacerbation is approximately 3 to 4 months [ Collard et al, 2016]. Acute 
exacerbation has been shown to increase the risk of death more profoundly than an absolute 
decline in FVC percent predicted of ≥  15% [Paterniti et al, 2017 ; Ley et al, 2017].  
The diagnostic criteria for acute exacerbation of IPF in this study will be as follows [Collard  et al, 2016]:  
• Previous or concurrent diagnosis of IPF  
• Acute worsening or development of dyspnea typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 1 month in duration

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  The following biomarkers will be measured: pF1+2, fibrinogen, D- dimer, aPTT, 
high- sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP), and monocytes. Samples will be collected at 
Screening, before administration of the IV loading dose of investigational product on Day 1, 
and on Days 8, 36, [ADDRESS_628846] on Day 1, and on Days 8, 36, 64, and 92: FXII (free  vs. total), C3a, C5a, IL-8, IL-10, CCL-2, CXCL-1, CCL-18, PAI-1, surfactant 
protein A (SP -A), surfactant protein D (SP -D), YKL -40, tenascin- C (TN -C), 
thrombospondin- 1 (TSP -1), VEGF, neo- epi[INVESTIGATOR_489172] -mediated 
degradation of citrullinated vimentin (VICM), neo-epi[INVESTIGATOR_60987] m atrix 
metalloproteinase -mediated degradation of C-reactive protein (CRPM), pro-Fib, neo-epi[INVESTIGATOR_489196] (CPa9-HNE), and collagen synthetic 
and degradation neo-epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (pro-C3/4/6 and C1/3/4/6M). 
The following PD parameters and biomarkers will be assessed at all study visits at which PK 
is being assessed, including before administration of the IV loading dose of investigational product and immediately after the EOI on Day 1: FXIIa- mediated kallikrein activity, FXII 
concentration, IL-6, and hs- CRP. Additionally, hs -CRP will also be assessed at Screening.  
Blood transcriptomics:  Blood will be collected for RNA sequencing to investigate changes 
in gene expression at Screening, before administration of the IV loading dose of 
investigational product on Day 1, and on Days 8, 36, 64, and 92. 
Proteomic analysis:  Blood will be collected to characterize the plasma proteome at 
Screening, before administration of the IV loading dose of investigational product on Day 1, 
and on Days 8, 36, 64, and 92. 
Details related to the collection, preparation, transfer, and storage of biomarker samples will 
be provided in the laboratory manual. Blood sampling time points for biomarker assessment are indicated in the Schedule of Assessments .

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  8.1.5 Pulmonary Function Tests 
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be performed at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments . The time windows for each type of assessment are detailed in 
Section  8.5.1. 
PFTs, including spi[INVESTIGATOR_369292], will be performed at the study site by [CONTACT_489232]’s SOPs and conducted in accordance with criteria published by [CONTACT_21629]  (ATS)  / ERS [ Graham et al, 2017; Graham et al, 
2019]. FVC reference ranges will be those established by [CONTACT_489233] 
[Cooper et al, 2017; Quanjer et al, 2012].  
Before spi[INVESTIGATOR_489197], long-acting bronchodilators must be washed 
out for [ADDRESS_628847] the precision of 
FVC as an endpoint in clinical studies [ Assayag et al, 2015].  
The decline in FVC is an accepted measure of disease course and reliably predicts mortality 
in patients with IPF [ Paterniti et al, 2017 ; Zappala et al, 2010; Flaherty et al, 2003; Collard et 
al, 2003; Quinn et al, 2019]. A decline in FVC of ≥  10% has been correlated with worse 
survival time in patients with IPF [ Paterniti et al, 2017 ; Zappala et al, 2010 ; Flaherty et al, 
2003; Collard et al, 2003] and recent evidence -based guidelines state that an absolute 
decrease in FVC of ≥  10% over time is an acceptable method for assessing disease 
progressi on and estimate risk of future mortality in patients with IPF [ Raghu et al, 2011]. 
Some studies suggest that an FVC decline ≥  5% may also be clinically significant [ Zappala et 
al, 2010; du Bois et al, 2011]. Using a relative (rather than an absolute) change in FVC has been shown to maximize the chance of identifying a ≥  10% decline without sacrificing 
prognostic accuracy [ Richeldi et al, 2012]. The change in FVC has been used as the primary 
endpoint in several randomized controlled studies in subjects with IPF [ Raghu et al, 2008; 
Raghu et al, 2012] including those for the approved drugs nintedanib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] [Richeldi et al, 2014; Noble et al, 2011].

  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  This study is a 14- week, placebo -controlled study. In both the INPULSIS studies and the 
INBUILD study with nintedanib in patients with IPF and progressive fibrosing interstitial 
lung diseases, respectively, a clear difference in the mean change in FVC from Baseline 
between the nintedanib groups and the placebo group is apparent at 12 weeks [ Richeldi et al, 
2014 (INPULSIS  1 and INPULSIS 2); Flaherty et al, 2019 (INBUILD)]. Similarly, a 
treatment effect is evident at Week  13 in the ASCEND study with pi[INVESTIGATOR_489198] [ King et al, 2014]. This study will determine if the FVC is altered by [CONTACT_489234]312 over a 14-week period in patients with IPF. 
As a safety parameter, single-breath DL CO will be assessed at Screening, before 
administration of investigation al product on Day 1 (Baseline), and at Week  14 
(EOT  / EW  Visit). DL CO will be assessed at the study site by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified 
designee according to the site’s SOPs, and conducted in accordance with criteria published by 
[CONTACT_10251] / ERS [ Graham et al, 2017]. The DL CO reference ranges used will be those established 
by [CONTACT_489233] [ Stanojevic et al, 2017]. DL CO will be corrected for 
hemoglobin retrospectively using a blood sample collected on the same day as the DL CO 
measurement, if available.

8.5 Visit Schedule  
8.5.1 Assessment Time Windows  
The timing and frequency of the study visits, as well as time windows, are described in the 
Schedule of Assessments . 
8.5.2 Screening Period  
All subjects (or the subject’s authorized representative) must provide written informed 
consent before any study- specific assessments or procedures are performed. Written informed 
consent is not required for assessments or procedures performed according to standard of care (eg, for diagnosis or treatment); results from such assessments may be used in the determination of study eligibility.  
A screening examination should be performed within 28 days before the intended date of 
dosing (Day 1). If a potential subject was not enrolled into the study within [ADDRESS_628850] may attend a second Screening Visit (for a maximum of [ADDRESS_628851]). In the event  that a potential subject is screened 
twice, all screening assessments must be repeated at the second Screening Visit, with the exception the 12-lead ECG, which may be repeated separately from other assessments, as necessary. The Sponsor’s medical monitor may also grant permission for tests to be repeated separately from other tests as necessary.

9 Adverse Events  
9.1 Definitions 
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
As per the ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting), an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
The period of observation for AEs extends from the time the subject gives informed consent 
until the end of study (see Section  9.4 for further details).  
AEs may include: 
• Exacerbation (ie, an increase in the frequency or severity) of a pre -existing condition. 
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of the 
eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of 
the condition during the study. 
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before investigational product administration. 
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of investigational product.

Protocol version: Amendment  3   Page 77 of 107 
Date: 18  October  2022  Confidential  CS-SOP- 04-T02 Version 2.0  
  Effective Date: Week commencing 25 -June-2018  AEs do not include: 
• Events identified at Screening that meet exclusion criteria  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE) 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example: 
o Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254785]-existing conditions that have not worsened. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254786] (eg, cosmetic surgery). 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a diagnostic procedure where the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254787] 
24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures (eg, chemotherapy). 
o Overdose of investigational product or any concomitant therapy that does not result in any adverse signs or symptoms. 
For laboratory safety parameters, any instances of absolute values being outside the reference range, or changes at any visit after study start that are consider ed by [CONTACT_99347], must recorded in the eCRF as AEs. In addition, at the investigator’s discretion, any changes or trends over time in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the eCRF as AEs if such changes or trends are considered clinically relevant, even if the absolute 
values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the following cases: 
• Increases in aPTT will not be classified as AEs because CSL312 is expected to cause 
increase in these parameters.  
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at screening, unless a further increase / decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition. 
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by [CONTACT_285068] (eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by [CONTACT_254845]. 
• Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible (eg, values that are 
incompatible with life or outside th e measuring range). 
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analysis, preferably in the same laboratory (ie, the previous result could be marked as not valid and should not 
necessarily be reported as an AE).

• Results in death:  The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion.  
• Is life -threatening:  The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subj ect 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe. 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]:  CSL 
considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for ≥  24 hours as 
the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489199] (eg, chemotherapy) are not considered defi ning criteria 
for SAEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is medically significant:  A medically significant event is defined as an event that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE cri teria, but which is judged by a physician to 
potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion. 
AEs that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonse rious AEs.

SAE), that AE will be considered related to the investigational product . 
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to investigational product or an 
alternative cause (eg,  natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be 
determined by [CONTACT_1004]: 
• Known pharmacology of investigational product. 
• Clinically and  / or pathophysiologically plausible context. 
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the 
literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, 
pallor).

9.6 Adverse Event Reporti ng 
9.6.1 Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have occurred. All AEs are to be recorded in the eCRF. If known, the medical diagnosis of an 
AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs, laboratory findings, and / or symptoms. The investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution or 
stabilization. If an AE is ongoing after the Follow- up Visit, the AE will continue to be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
If, during the study period, a subject presents with a preexisting condition that was not noted 
at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical 
History eCRF.

[IP_ADDRESS]  FXIIa -mediated Kallikrein Activity 
Change from Baseline in FXIIa- mediated kallikrein activity over time will be calculated for 
each subject. The comparison of primary interest is the change from Baseline at Week  14. If 
the data are not normally distributed by [CONTACT_489240], an appropriate data transformation may be done. The data (or transformed data) will be compared between 
CSL312 and placebo using mixed- model repeated measure (MMRM), with treatment group 
and visit as fix ed effects, and Baseline as a covariate. Analyses will be implemented using 
SAS PROC MIXED. Interactions with visit will be included for treatment group and Baseline. A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach will be used. An unstructured 
variance- covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. This 
variance- covariance matrix will be estimated across treatment groups. If the model fails to 
converge, a heterogeneous Toeplitz structure (the TOEPH option in SAS PROC MIXED) will 
be used. The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of 
freedom and adjust standard errors.

  Effective Date: Week commencing [ADDRESS_628878] of the 
signed CSP will be permitted without documented approval of the CSL Medical Monitor or 
designee and the IRB / IEC. In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator at the study site will institute any medical procedures deemed appropriate. However, al l such procedures 
must be promptly reported to the CSL Medical Monitor and the IRB / IEC.  
Modifications to the CSP that may affect subject safety or the way the study is to be conducted will be documented in a protocol amendment, which must be approved by [CONTACT_1201] / IEC.  
Administrative changes to the CSP, defined as minor corrections and / or clarifications that have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted, will not require IRB / IEC approval, but will be submitted to the IRB  / IEC for their inform ation. 
13.4 Protocol Deviations 
All instances where the requirements of the CSP were not complied with will be tracked. Corresponding subjects may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator and / or CSL. Protocol deviations arise when either subjects who have been entered in the 
study and / or the study sites deviate from the IRB / IEC -approved CSP. 
If a major protocol deviation (ie, a deviation that could have a significant effect on the subject’s safety, rights, or welfare and  / or on the integrity of the study data) occurs, the 
investigator must notify CSL and the appropriate IRB / IEC as soon as possible or as per local requirements.

13.5.1  Data Collection  
The investigator (or delegate) will maintain individual records for each subject. These records 
should include dates when a subject visited the study site, records of vital signs, medical history, or physical examinations, administration of investigational product or concomitant therapy, any AEs expe rienced, and other notes as appropriate. These records (electronic or 
paper) constitute source data.  
Electronic CRF entries will be considered source data if the eCRF is the site of the original recordings (ie, there is no other written or electronic record of the data).  
An eCRF will be provided by [CONTACT_254815] (or delegate) for each subject enrolled into the study. The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring accurate and proper completion of the eCRF in a 
timely manner so that it always reflects the latest observa tions on the subjects enrolled in the 
study. All entries on the eCRF must be backed up by [CONTACT_489244]. All source data will be kept according to all applicable regulatory 
requirements. Source data must be completed legibly for each subject enrolled into the study and signed by [CONTACT_093] (or delegate). 
13.5.[ADDRESS_628880] access to 
source data documents. CSL’s study monitor will perform this function. 
Following completion of eCRF pages and entry of the data into a database, the data will be 
checked electronically for consistency and plausi bility. Queries will be generated for 
questionable data and clarification sought from the investigator. These data queries must be 
resolved in a timely manner by [CONTACT_093] (or delegate).

Research Agreement. An investigator study file prepared by [CONTACT_254815] (or delegate), containing all 
applicable documents for use at the study site, will be made available to the investigator before the start of t he study. All study documentation and materials maintained in the 
investigator study file must be kept in conformance with applicable national laws and 
regulations. 
All study documentation and materials maintained in the investigator study file at the stud y 
site must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_254815]’s study monitor (or delegate) to determine that 
all required documentation is present and correct. 
The study may be audited or inspected by [CONTACT_254867] a competent 
health authority. 
Following completion of the study, the investigator is responsible for archiving the 
investigator’s study file, the subject’s records and the source data according to applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
13.6 Study and Site Closure  
CSL reserves the right to prematurely  discontinue or suspend the study either at a particular 
site or at all study sites at any time and for any reason. If such action is taken, the CSL Study 
Monitor (or delegate) will discuss this with the investigator at each study site at that time and notify the investigators in writing. If the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, all investigators and the relevant regulatory agencies will be immediately notified of the 
action as well as the reason for the suspension / termination. The inve stigator at each study 
site will advise their IRB  / IEC overseeing the study of the suspension / termination.  
13.7 Clinical Study Report  
A CSR will be written after the completion of the study. CSL or its agent will write the report in consultation with the investigator or, if applicable, a nominated coordinating investigator 
(or delegate). CSL requires that the coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_489201]. 
Progress reports may be provided to the relevant regulatory bodies in accordance with their 
requirements.

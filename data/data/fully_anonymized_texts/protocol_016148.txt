Summary  
Objectives:  
Research Questions:  
1.What is the natural history of COVID -19 related olfactory dysfunction?
2.Is there a therapeutic benefit of omega -3 supplement administration for COVID -19
related olfactory dysfunction?
The aim of the study is to gain an understanding of the natural history of olfactory dysfunction  
associated with COVID -19 infection in addition to evaluating whether there is a therapeutic role 
for omega -3 supplementation during the subacute period. Through this study, we hope to p rovide 
anticipatory guidance regarding the prognosis for COVID -19 related olfactory dysfunction as 
well as assess a potential therapeutic intervention.  
Background:  
Infection with the novel coronavirus (COVID -19) has been linked to new -onset olfactory 
dysfunction, often as the only presenting symptom.1-3 In one multicenter European study, 85.6% 
of patients with mild to moderate symptoms reported hyposmia or anosmia with early recovery 
of olfactory function in just under half of patients.[ADDRESS_1234418] -viral anosmia. We ho pe to gain a better understanding of each through a randomized 
double -blind placebo control study that assesses both objective and subjective perception of 
olfactory dysfunction over a period of 6 weeks after infection.

Participants will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_882539].  
Risk and Benefits  
Risks to Subjects  
Patients will be randomized into treatment and control groups. The treatment  group will 
receive omega -3-fatty acid supplementation (1000 mg of omega -3 fatty acid blend 
including 683 mg Eicosapentaenoic Acid and 252 mg Docosahexaenoic Acid) to be taken 
daily for 6 weeks. The control arm will receive a placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_882535].  
The main risks to subjects that choose to participate are as following:  
-BSIT: This [ADDRESS_1234425]™ is useful for quantifying
smell loss in situations where less than five minutes of time are available. The odors are
well known in most cultures. There are no side effects known to occur from this test.
Patients could theoretically experience some nausea, vomiting, or headache from the
different smells.
-Omega -3 fish oil has been deemed "generally regarded as safe" b y the Federal Drug
Administration and is considered to be very rarely associated with significant adverse
side effects. Side effects of omega -3 fatty acid supplementation are typi[INVESTIGATOR_882536], heartburn, headache, and unpleasant taste. Patients
also sometimes note a fishy odor or taste in their mouth that they find unpleasant. Taking
high doses of fish oil supplements can potentially increase the risk of bleeding. However
this is associated with much higher dosing and d uration than what will be utilized during
this study.1 A 2018 Chang et al. meta -analysis of 21 randomized clinical trials involving
a total of 12,750 patients receiving omega -3 fatty acid supplementation found no serious
adverse events, concluding that the y are generally safe and well -tolerated but are
associated with these mild side effects.2 No patient -reported adverse events were
reported in the 2020 Yan et al. randomized control study on omega -3 fatty acid
supplementation after skull base surgery.3

Descriptio n of Procedures Taken to Lessen the Probability or Magnitude of Risks  
Patients randomized to the treatment arm will be administered omega -3-fatty acid 
supplementation daily, as des cribed previously. Patients will be provided a contact [CONTACT_882540]. Patients 
may drop out of the study for any reason at any time. 
Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
Significant adverse reactions to treatment will lead to immediate termination of treatment. 
Medical care will be provided by a Mount Sinai physician or a physician of the participant's 
choosing. Participant insurance will be charged for medical  care related to treatment.  
Expanded Direct Benefit to Subjects  
Participants may not receive any benefit from participation in the study. There is a possibility 
that participants in the treatment arm regain a greater degree of olfactory function or experi ence 
recovery at a faster rate as the result of the intervention.  
Benefit to Society  
Given the extent of the current COVID -[ADDRESS_1234427] subjects' decisions. All saved data will  
be permanently destroyed at the end of this study.  
Economic Impact on Subjects  
There is no anticipated cost to research subjects. The cost of omega -3-fatty acid treatment and 
the placebo control will be covered by [CONTACT_882541] - Head and Neck Surgery. All additional proced ures and office 
visits are standard of care and do not incur any additional cost to the patient. Patients are 
encouraged to call the Mount Sinai Otolaryngology FPA service phone system in case they 
experience any side effects.  
Procedures  
Description of  the Study Design  
This is a prospective, double -blind, randomized controlled trial.  
Description of Procedures Being Performed  
Patients will be recruited (utilizing inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined above) through the 
Otolaryngology Faculty Practic es as well as the web based application STOP COVID NYC. 
Current recruitment goals are one hundred seventy six patients, with eighty eight patients in each 
group.  After recruitment the patients will be block -randomized by a computer -generated 
sequence in a  1:1 allocation to treatment or control arms. Patients randomized to the treatment 
group will be allocated a supply of 1000 mg capsules of omega -3 fatty acid blend including 683 
mg Eicosapentaenoic Acid and 252 mg Docosahexaenoic Acid) to be taken daily fo r 6 weeks. 
Patients randomized to the control group will receive a placebo and will follow the same regimen 
as the treatment group. Collection of data (described below) will occur through the use of the 
EPIC electronic medical record system, through phone conversations between investigators and 
subjects, and through information collected during office visits. The primary outcome studied 
will be the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) which will be administered 6 weeks after 
symptom onset. The secondary o utcomes include patient -reported outcome measure surveys, a 
modified Brief Questionnaire of Olfactory Dysfunction - Negative Statements (QOD -NS) survey 
and Sino -Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22), administered at time points of 1, 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_1234428] data.

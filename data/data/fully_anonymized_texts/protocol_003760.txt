  08/30/18 	II.			Background	and	Rationale	A.				Background:	Greater	than	12%	of	infants	in	the	United	States	are	born	premature	and	may	begin	their	lives	within	the	neonatal	intensive	care	unit	(Matthews	et	al).			Within	this	population,	the	evaluation	and	treatment	for	early-onset	sepsis	(EOS)	is	an	ongoing	controversy.		EOS	remains	the	leading	cause	of	morbidity	and	mortality	in	neonates	with	a	rate	of	0.98	per	1000	live	births	(Stoll	et	al).		Infants	admitted	to	NICUs	are	frequently	started	on	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107716].	Although	the	CDC	has	released	algorithms	for	the	evaluation	of	EOS	for	all	newborns,	without	a	lower	gestational	age	limit	indicated	to	which	they	apply,	clinical	experience	has	shown	that	nearly	all	premature	infants	receive	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107717]	(Verani	et	al	2010).  Recent	algorithms	by	[CONTACT_107744]	&	Newborn	recommend	discontinuing	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107718]	48	hours	with	negative	cultures	in	preterm	infants	(Polin	et	al	2012).		However,	although	it	has	been	shown	that	discontinuing	antibiotics	when	cultures	are	negative	in	asymptomatic	ELBW	infants	does	not	compromise	clinical	outcomes,	they	often	receive	prolonged	antibiotic	treatment	courses	(Cordero	&	Ayers	2003).		Furthermore,	Kuppala	et	al	(2011),	studied	very	low	birth	weight	(VLBW)	infants,	and	found	that	within	their	population,	16%	did	not	receive	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107717].		For	those	who	were	treated,	each	day	of	initial	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107719]-onset	sepsis	(LOS),	NEC	or	death,	and	for	infants	who	had	received	any	initial	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107720],	the	number	needed	to	harm	was	3.		Within	our	unit,	there	were	794	admissions	in	2014.		Of	these,	196	were	within	our	study’s	target	age	range	of	28-34	6/[ADDRESS_119785]	4	days	of	life	had	less	gut	microbial	diversity,	as	well	as	an	attenuation	in	colonization	with	Bifidobacterium	and	an	increase	in	colonization	with	Enterococcus.		Additionally,	a	study	by	[CONTACT_107745][INVESTIGATOR_107721],	Actinobacteria,	and	Lactobacillus	than	the	unexposed	infants	for	up	to	a	month	following	the	treatment	course. These changes within the microbiome may be especially important within the premature	population,	where	Wang	et	al	(2009)	found	that	infants	who	developed	necrotizing	enterocolitis	(NEC)	had	significantly	more	days	of	antibiotics	prior	to	disease	onset,	as	well	
  08/30/18 as	differences	in	their	gastrointestinal	microbiome,	having	less	microbial	diversity	and	an	increased	abundance	of	Gammaproteobacter.	Similarly,	Cotton	et	al	(2009)	has	also	shown	that	prolonged	antibiotic	therapy	(>5	days)	was	associated	with	increased	odds	of	NEC	or	death.		In	earlier	studies,	Cotton	et	al	(2006)	linked	prolonged	broad	spectrum	antibiotic	therapy	with	increased	risk	for	invasive	fungal	infections.		Beyond	the	immediate	neonatal	timeframe,	gastrointestinal	microbial	dysbiosis	has	also	been	linked	to	multiple	diseases	affecting	long	term	health,	including	inflammatory	bowel	disease	(IBD),	obesity,	asthma	and	atopy	(Arietta	et	al	2014).			Due	to	the	effects	of	the	microbiome	health	and	disease,	as	well	as	growing	concerns	for	antibiotic	resistance,	there	has	been	a	growing	recognition	for	the	need	for	antimicrobial	stewardship.	According	to	the	Infections	Diseases	Society	of	America	(IDSA),	antimicrobial	stewardship	includes	interventions	targeted	toward	the	improvement	and	monitoring	of	appropriate	antimicrobial	use	by	[CONTACT_107746],	including	the	type	of	drug	used,	the	dose,	the	duration	of	therapy	and	the	route	of	administration.		While	studies	have	found	that,	in	general,	antibiotic	stewardship	is	not	commonly	used	within	pediatric	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]	(Hersh	et	al	2009),	Comer	Children’s	Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107722]	a	strong,	multidisciplinary	antimicrobial	stewardship	team	with	an	active	presence	within	the	NICU.	These	collaborations	are	necessary	to	promote	proper	and	safe	use	of	antibiotics,	as	Grohskoph	et	al		(2005)	found	that	as	many	as	47%	if	infants	within	NICUs	were	on	at	least	one	antibiotic,	and	Clark	et	al	(2006)	found	that	antibiotics	are	the	most	prescribed	medications	within	NICUs.		Within	our	NICU	at	Comer,	30-40%	of	patients	are	on	at	least	one	antibiotic	on	a	given	day	(Nash	et	al	2014).		While	there	is	less	published	literature	on	the	presence	of	antibiotic	resistant	organisms	(AROs)	within	NICUs,	de	Man	et	al	(2000)	found	that	infants	treated	with	cefotaxime	as	initial	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107723]	[ADDRESS_119786]	to	promote	healthy	gastrointestinal	microbiome	development,	as	well	as	limit	the	presence	of	AROs.		While	there	is	little	data	supporting	the	withholding	of	initial	antibiotics	in	neonates,	the	administration	of	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107724].		In	1961,	William	Blanc	questioned	the	safety	of	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107717],	stating	“The	diagnosis	of	congenital	and	early	neonatal	infections	is	difficult,	and	the	systemic	prophylactic	administration	of	antibiotics	is	potentially	harmful.		Its	dangers	have	to	be	weighed	against	the	risk	of	infection.”			More	recently,	Tagare	et	al	(2010)	found	that	in	low	risk	preterm	neonates	there	was	no	evidence	that	routine	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107725]	a	protective	effect	in	clinical	sepsis,	further	questioning	the	immediate	use	of	antibiotics	at	birth.	 B.	Rationale:	Evaluation	and	treatment	for	EOS	is	an	ongoing	controversy	in	neonatology.	While	the	risk	of	morbidity	and	mortality	from	EOS	is	high,	the	frequency	is	low	at	0.98	per	1000	live	births	(Stoll	et	al	2011).	Although	the	CDC	has	released	algorithms	for	the	evaluation	of	EOS	for	all	newborns,	there	are	no	specific	algorithms	for	preterm	infants,	and	clinical	
  08/30/18 experience	has	shown	that	nearly	all	premature	infants	receive	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107717]	(Verani	et	al	2010).	Recently,	there	has	been	growing	literature	on	the	detrimental	effects	of	antibiotics	on	the	development	of	the	gastrointestinal	microbiome.	Important	in	the	premature	population,	Wang	et	al	(2009)	found	that	infants	who	developed	NEC	had	significantly	more	days	of	antibiotics	prior	to	disease	onset,	as	well	as	differences	in	their	microbiome.	Cotton	et	al	(2009)	has	also	shown	that	prolonged	antibiotic	therapy	(>5	days)	was	associated	with	increased	odds	of	NEC	or	death.	Additionally,	the	microbiome	has	been	linked	with	long-term	health	outcomes,	such	as	asthma,	obesity	and	IBD.		With	this	growing	body	of	evidence	suggesting	potential	harm	associated	with	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107726],	and	the	growing	numbers	of	infections	with	antibiotic	resistant	organisms	(Bizzarro	&	Gallagher	2007),	it	is	critical	to	develop	guidelines	to	limit	antibiotic	use	in	premature	infants,	and	study	the	effect	on	clinical	outcomes	and	the	microbiome	development.	III.		Research	Plan		Methods:	Through	literature	review	and	expert	input,	inclusion	and	exclusion	criteria	for	randomization	have	been	developed	and	reviewed	to	allow	preterm	infants,	with	a	low	risk	of	infection,	to	be	closely	observed	and	monitored,	rather	than	receive	routine	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107727].		Inclusion	Criteria	for	randomization:	1) Infant	must	be	born	between	the	gestational	ages	of	28	0/7	weeks	and	34	6/7	weeks		-AND-	2) Infant	must	be	considered	to	have	a	low	risk	of	infection	by	[CONTACT_107747]:	a. Delivered	for	maternal	indications	(Cesarean	section	or	induction	of	labor	for	maternal	health,	including	HELLP,	pre-eclampsia,	placental	abruption,	history	of	IUFD/abruption,	multiple	gestation	requiring	preterm	delivery,	etc)	-OR-	b. Delivered	due	to	preterm	labor	to	a	mother	without	the	diagnosis	of	chorioamnionitis/maternal	fever	or	prolonged	rupture	of	membranes	>18	hours		Exclusion	Criteria:	1) Signs	of	clinical	illness	within	the	first	3	hours	of	life	(Escobar	et	al	2014):	a. 5-minute	Apgar	<5	b.

If	at	any	time	during	the	initial	48	hour	trial	period	an	infant	shows	clinical	signs	of	sepsis,	as	defined	below,	or	the	initial	blood	culture	becomes	positive,	the	infant	will	be	un-blinded.		Repeat	evaluation	will	be	performed,	and	antibiotics	will	either	be	initiated	for	those	in	the	intervention	group,	or	appropriately	broadened,	per	the	discretion	of	the	medical	team,	for	those	already	receiving	antibiotics.		These	patients	will	remain	in	the	study	for	intention-to-treat	analysis		Signs	of	clinical	sepsis	for	which	to	unblind	infant	from	the	study	and	repeat	evaluation	(Hofer	et	al	2012,	Bekhof	et	al	2013)			-Temperature	Instability	(Rectal,	>38.5C,	<36.0C	or	>1.5C	change	in	3	hours)		-Increased	respi[INVESTIGATOR_107729]	20%	increase	in	oxygen		-Pale/dusky	skin	tones		-Prolonged	capi[INVESTIGATOR_107730]		-Lethargy		-Development	of	Seizures		-Requiring	vasoactive	medications	for	cardiovascular	support		-Other	signs	of	illness	per	the	discretion	of	the	managing	team		
  08/30/18 Throughout	their	entire	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],	all	infants	will	receive	routine	neonatal	care	per	the	medical	team	managing	the	patient.				During	the	entire	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107731],	daily	stool	samples	will	be	collected	from	the	infant	diaper	as	available	from	spontaneous	defecation,	for	analysis	of	the	fetal	microbiota	through	16S	rRNA	gene-based	analysis,	as	previously	described	by	[CONTACT_107748],	et	al	(2009).		Through	this	stool	analysis,	the	development	of	the	fetal	microbiome	from	birth	through	discharge	will	be	examined	and	compared	between	the	infants	who	do,	or	do	not,	receive	empi[INVESTIGATOR_107714].		Some	of	the	stool	samples	will	also	be	shared	with	the	investigators	at	the	University	of	Guelph	in	Ontario,	Canada	for	further	analysis,	including	identification	of	certain	metabolites	and	antibiotic	levels.		The	samples	that	are	sent	will	be	deidentified.		Parents	may	be	contact[CONTACT_107749]	[ADDRESS_119788]	once	they	are	outside	of	the	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107732].		All	supplies	for	stool	samples	and	return	postage	will	be	provided	to	the	parents.		Parents	will	receive	a	small	monetary	compensation	($[ADDRESS_119789])	for	returning	the	questionnaire	and	stool	sample.				In	addition	to	analyzing	the	microbiome,	blood	culture	results,	clinical	outcomes	(chronic	lung	disease,	retinopathy	of	prematurity,	intraventricular	hemorrhage,	death,	NEC),	length	of	stay,	initiation	and	type	of	feeds,	feeding	tolerance	and	total	days	of	antibiotic	use	will	be	examined	through	review	of	the	EMR.				Monitoring:		The	study	team	will	report	all	events	in	accordance	with	IRB	policies	and	procedures.	Events	not	meeting	reporting	criteria	will	be	provided	at	the	time	of	continuing	review.		All	enrolled	infants	will	be	continuously	monitored	for	signs	of	infection	during	the	first	48	hours	of	life,	as	well	as	through	the	remainder	of	their	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107733].		Because	of	the	small	size	of	this	pi[INVESTIGATOR_107734],	if	there	is	any	adverse	event	or	safety	concern,	it	will	be	immediately	analyzed.				In	addition,	we	will	meet	to	evaluate	for	adverse	events	and	safety	for	every	3	patients	that	are	enrolled	into	the	randomization	portion	of	the	study	(weekly	may	be	impractical	due	to	the	varied	response	in	consent	among	our	patient	population	-	there	may	be	many	weeks	without	new	study	participants).		This	will	result	in	10	meetings	throughout	the	course	of	the	pi[INVESTIGATOR_107734].		We	will	also	invite	the	NICU's	medical	director	to	participate	in	these	meetings	to	ensure	patient	safety.		We	will	not	be	performing	an	interim	efficacy	analysis.		This	is	due	to	the	small	sample	size	and	single	site	design,	as	well	as	their	prematurity	of	our	study	population	which	requires	prolonged	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].		The	study	subjects	will	be	continuously	and	closely	monitored	due	to	their	gestational	age	and	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107735].		If	at	any	time	a	patient	becomes	ill	during	the	initial	48	hours,	they	will	become	unblinded.		If	it	is	a

1 1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1    Study Design  
 
This study includes  a brief P hase I dose escalation to assess the tolerability of 
pyrimethamine in relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic L eukemia/Small Lymphocytic 
Lymphoma, CLL/SLL, and T- Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia, T-LGL, and to 
correlate dose with pharmacodynamic efficacy.  It then moves rapi[INVESTIGATOR_332936] a Phase II study 
to assess efficacy, using a Simon two stage design.  Due to PK and PD results that suggest that a higher dose between 100 and 150 mg may be required for optimal efficacy,  
and the absence of clear drug -related toxicity thus far,  the protocol is being amended to 
continue the phase 1 dose escalation to a higher dose.  
1.2 Primary Objectives  
Phase I :  To determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose of 
pyrimethamine in relapsed CLL/SLL  and T- LGL  
 
Phase II:  To determine the ORR of pyrimethamine in relapsed CLL/SLL  and T -
LGL  
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
• To assess the toxicity profile of pyrimethamine in relapsed CLL/SLL  and T-
LGL, both acutely and over prolonged daily dosing. 
 
• To determine pyrimethamine levels in vivo with prolonged dosing. 
 • To determine the progression- free survival following pyrimethamine for the 
treatment of relapsed CLL/SLL  and T- LGL. 
 • To determine whether pyrimethamine inhibits STAT3 in vivo by [CONTACT_799611]3 dependent gene expression in CLL cells, and 
T-LGL and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
 
• To determine whether known prognostic factors in CLL/SLL and T- LGL 
correlate with response to pyrimethamine.  
 
• To assess the impact of CT scans on response evaluation in relapsed CLL/SLL 
and T- LGL.  
 
 2. BACKGROUND  
2.1  Investigational Agent: Pyrimethamine  
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
2  Pyrimethamine (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6- ethyl -2,4- pyrimidinediamine, Daraprim) is an oral 
folic acid antagonist used as an antiparasitic compound.  It is a reversible weak inhibitor of 
dihydrofolate reductase. Due to a differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth, pyrimethamine is highly selective against plasmodia and Toxoplasma gondii . 
Pyrimethamine is well absorbed with a plasma half -life of approximately 96 hours. 
Pyrimethamine is 87% bound to human plasma proteins.  At the maximum dose test ed in this 
trial, namely 50 mg/day, mean plasma pyrimethamine concentrations were 1,893+/-1,182 ng/ml
1. 
As a folate antagonist, caution is recommended in patients with possible folate deficiency, such as individuals with malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism, or pregnancy, and those receiving therapy such as phenytoin or lorazepam, which may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity.  
The 50 mg/day dose maximum  proposed for this trial is the recommended dose for the 
treatment of toxoplasmosis, and is routinely used for at least 1- 3 weeks depending on treatment 
response.  At this dose, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by [CONTACT_799612]; it usually disappears promptly upon reduction of dosage. 
Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce bone marrow suppression, which can be reversed with discontinuing the drug and with addition of leucovorin. Side effects include megaloblasti c 
anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm.  Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens -
Johnson syndrome), have been reported but primarily when pyrimethamine i s administered 
concomitantly with a sulfonamide.  
Due to the possibility of myelosuppression and given the patient population in this study, we 
include a brief Phase I dose escalation to assess the tolerability of pyrimethamine in relapsed 
CLL/SLL, and to correlate dose with pharmacodynamic efficacy.  The Phase [ADDRESS_1102959] convenient dose a vailable  and significantly lower than the usual dose used

2.2 Study Disease s: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  and T Large Granular 
Lymphocytic Leukemia  
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL / SLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the

chemoimmunotherapy combinations with complete remission rates approaching 50% and progression- free survivals of 3 -5 years
4-6.  However 10- 20% of patients still fail to respond  or 
relapse early, and all patients still relapse eventually.  For these patients, especially those who are 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
3 fludarabine refractory with bulky adenopathy, or those with poor risk cytogenetics, there remains 
an urgent need for new more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_799600].  The field has therefore turned to targeted drugs, desig ned to directly address the mechanism of carcinogenesis, in an effort to 
improve efficacy and reduce toxicity.  
 
T-LGL is an uncommon low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder that can occur as an isolated entity or in the context of rheumatologic or neoplastic disease.  Many patients remain asymptomatic and do not require treatment.  However, some patients develop anemia (either autoimmune or hypoproliferative), neutropenia, infection, or disease related symptoms such as fatigue.  Oral methotrexate and oral cyclophosphamide have been the most commonly utilized agents with response rates ranging from 38-64%
7.  These agents are not curative and can have 
significant toxicity including myelo suppression, mucositis, and liver function abnormalities.  
Other agents that have been investigated with varying success include cyclosporine and alemtuzumab
8,[ADDRESS_1102961] been described
10,11. Therefore we 
propose amending the existing protocol to include patients with T- LGL.  We are not requiring a 
demonstrable STAT3 mutatio n since the presence of these mutations is not clearly known to be 
predictive of response to STAT3 inhibitors. 
 
2.3 Rationale  
2.3.1 Biology of the STAT family of Transcription Factors 
The function of lymphoid cells is regulated by [CONTACT_799613], self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation.  Although cytokines activate a number 
of signaling pathways, increasing evidence suggests that STATs, for s ignal transducers and 
activators of transcription, play a key role in this process.  STATs are present in the cytoplasm of cells under basal conditions.  When stimulated by a growth factor or cytokine, STATs become phosphorylated on a unique tyrosine residue which triggers their dimerization.  STAT dimers then translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific nine base pair sequences in the regulatory region of target genes, thereby [CONTACT_799614] (Figure 1).  Given that STATs control genes t hat regulate critical biological functions including cell proliferation and survival, 
physiological STAT activation is rapid and transient.  Roughly one hour after STAT activation, the STATs have been dephosphorylated and have returned to the cytoplasm.  Although classically STATs are activated by [CONTACT_787137], certain STAT family members, including STAT3, have a highly conserved serine residue towards the carboxyl terminus that is also phosphorylated in a highly regulated manner.  Increasing evidence indicates that phosphorylation of this residue, serine 727, can have activating effects independent of tyrosine phosphorylation
12,13. 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. [ADDRESS_1102962] CLL can decrease the serine 
phosphorylation of STAT3
16.  Genes whose expression are activated by [CONTACT_67428]3 control critical 
cellular functions such as cell survival (e.g., Mcl -1 and  Bcl -xl), which is a major factor in both 
the pathogenesis of CLL, and its resistance to curative cytotoxic therapy17.  While continued 
STAT3 f unction is critical for tumor cell survival, STAT3 can be inhibited in normal cells with 
little consequence18.  Taken together, these findings suggest that STAT3 is an excellent target for 
the treatment of CLL  and T -LGL.

The compound that led to the greatest specific inhibition of STAT3 activity in the initial screen 
was pyrimethamine, a compound that is FDA approved for treating parasitic infections such as 
toxoplasmosis and malaria.  It is orally bioavailable  and has relatively few significant side 
effects.  Given its slow elimination, it is generally dosed once daily.  Pyrimethamine shows half-
maximal activity (EC 50) at approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1102964] on STAT3 phosphorylation or nuclear 
translocation, but it appears to inhibit STAT3 localization to its cognate genomic DNA sequences, thereby [CONTACT_799615]. Although pyrimethamine is known as an inhibitor of dihyrofolate reductase (DHFR), albeit a weak one, the potent DHFR inhibitor methotrexate did not inhibit STAT3 activity in this assay.  Therefore, STAT3 inhibition by [CONTACT_799616].  The effect of pyrimethamine was examined in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are characterized by [CONTACT_799617]3 activation.

Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
5 PCR normalized to GAPDH, we found that 1 µM pyrimethamine , a concentration achievable in 
vivo, decreased expression of Bcl-xl and cyclin D1 by [CONTACT_3450] 60%.  Pyrimethamine 
showed no toxicity in non- transformed hematopoietic cells, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], or fibroblasts.    
 
2.3.3  Pyrimethamine shows therapeutic effects in CLL cells in vitro.   In model systems, 
pyrimethamine effectively inhibits STAT3 -dependent gene transcription at low micromolar 
concentrations that can be achieved clinically in humans (Figure 2).  By [CONTACT_22242], pyrimethamine 
has no effect on gene expression driven by [CONTACT_153542]- κB or the closely related transcription factor 
STAT5. Pyrimethamine (5 µM) significantly decreased expression of a panel of STAT3-
dependent target genes, including BCL3, BCL6, cyclin D1, and SMAD7, while showing no effect on expression of “housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” genes including tubulin and GAPDH, or NF- κB-
dependent genes including A20 and TLR4.  [CONTACT_311272]’s lab next assessed the effect of 
pyrimethamine on the viability of primary CLL cells in culture.  As early as 48 hours after treatment, pyrimethamine caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in survival of CLL cells, 
beginning at concentrations as low as 1 µM, and it does so through induction of apoptosis as 
measured by [CONTACT_358704] V staining.  Thus, pyrimethamine, a well tolerated FDA approved drug, 
inhibits STAT3 and induces apoptosis of primary CLL cells in vitro. 
 
 
2.3.4 Study Rationale 
Based on these data, we propose a clinical trial of the STAT3 inhibitor pyrimethamine in 
relapsed CLL/SLL  and T -LGL.  The drug is FDA approved and has been well -tolerated in a 
wide variety of patients, suggesting that its toxicity profile is favo rable.  The in vitro data suggest 
that pyrimethamine may be highly effective against CLL/SLL in vivo, warranting a clinical test.

3 transaminitis (which occurred also in the setting of initiation of doxycycline and a change in type of hormone replacement therapy); transient grade 4 thrombocytopenia in a patient with baseline grade 3 thrombocytopenia and a history of prior stem cell transplant; and transient grade [ADDRESS_1102966] response at the lower doses was prolonged stable disease  (7 months in a very 
heavily pretreated patient)   
2.[ADDRESS_1102967]. Frank’s lab has  found to be most informative of pyrimethamine-induced 
STAT3 inhibition in CLL cells treated in  vitro, as well as four genes they have found to be 
invariant which will be used for normalization.  Taken together these assays s hould enable us to 
determine whether adequate pyrimethamine levels were present and whether pyrimethamine successfully inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and activation of target genes.    
 Preliminary results of PK and PD analyses from the first three dose cohorts, up to [ADDRESS_1102968] meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to

described in the WHO classification of l ymphoid malignancies, including immunophenotypic 
confirmation that the tumor cells co -express B cell antigens CD19 / 20 and CD5.  Mantle c ell 
lymphoma should be excluded based on positive staining of the tumor cells for CD23, or the absence of staining of the tumor cells for cyclin D1 or the absence of t(11;14).  This diagnosis should be confirmed at a Dana- Farber Harvard Cancer Center insti tution (DFCI, BWH, MGH, 
BIDMC)  within approximately one month after the subject is registered.  Any question on 
histology confirmation should be brought to the attention of the Principal  Investigator.

Treatm ent will be administered on an outpatient basis. Expected toxicities  and potential 
risks as well as  dose modifications for pyrimethamine  are described in Section 6 ( Expected 
Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications ). No investigational or commercial 
agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_430150] 's malignancy.  
 Subjects will self -administer this oral drug once daily, in the morning, with food.  Dose is to be 
held until lab work results are reported on days that subjects are scheduled for clinic (i.e, Cycle 1 Day 1, 8 and 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, etc.). Therapy will be continuous, with one cycle arbitrarily defined as 28 days (+/ - 3 days) .  All subjects will initially be treated for one [ADDRESS_1102978] th ree dose levels  below were completed with

12 Following completion of the  additional cohorts of the  Phase 1 study, the  PK, PD and safety 
data will be assessed to determine the recommended Phase  2 dose.  Any subjects who are 
continuing on study from the Phase I portion, who are deriving clinical benefit without 
significant toxicity and who are currently on a lower dose than the recommended Phase  2 
dose, may be considered for dose escalation to the newly determined Phase  2 dose, at the 
discretion of the treating physician and the Principal Investigator.   *The [ADDRESS_1102980] resolved to grade 1 or 
less prior to re -initiation of study therapy.  For a detailed discussion of the 
management of hematologic toxicity please see section 6.3.1  
  
5.2 Agent Administration   
 
  5.2.1    Pyrimethamine  
 
• Administration – Subjects will self -administer  Pyrimethamine once 
daily , in the morning, with food.   
 
• Dosing – The daily dose will be determined during the Phase I study by [CONTACT_799620]. (See Table 1 : Dose -Escalation Table, S ection 5.0)  
Following the determination of the Phase 2 dose, all subjects will be enrolled to 
that dose level.   
 
• Hydration – No hydration is required. *  
 
• Oral Doses – The daily dose should be administered with food.  Any doses 
vomited within one hour of administration should be retaken.  Any doses missed 
can be taken later on the same day they were missed, with food.  If a missed dose is not discovered until the following day, the dose should not be made up.  There are no foods or liquids that are contraindicated.  
 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
13 * Investigators should monitor patients for tumor lysis with labs twice 
per week in the first cycle and at least weekly thereafter (in the first 
cycle), and subjects will be encouraged to maintain oral hydration.  
Intravenous hydration or additional treatment for TLS should commence if any laboratory evidence of such is demonstrated. At a minimum, 
hyperuricemia, hydration, and electrolyte disturbances will be monitored 
closely and addressed promptly. 
 
 
5.3 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any non -hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or 
greater severity (excluding asymptomatic grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that are not life -
threatening and respond to treatment; grade 3 fatigue; grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea occurring without optimal prophylaxis).  Infectious toxicities will only be considered dose-limiting if grade 4 or greater.  Any grade 4 non-hematol ogical toxicity, as well as any 
irreversible grade 2 cardiac, renal or neurologic toxicities, will be considered dose- limiting.  
Grading of non- hematologic toxicities will be according to CTEP Active Version of the 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adver se Events (CTCAE ). DLT refers to toxicities 
experienced during the first cycle of treatment only.  
 
Hematologic toxicity will be graded according to the  2008 IWCLL criteria (see table in 
section 6.3.1 under dose modifications)
19.  Hematologic toxicity will only be considered 
dose- limiting as follows: 
 
   Grade [ADDRESS_1102981] 7 days after discontinuation of drug in Cycle 1 only. 
 
Abnormal hematologic values are not noted as inclusion or exclusion criteria. Subjects with starting ANC  ≤  1000  (or greater than 1 000 but requiring growth factor support) or 
starting platelet count ≤ 20,000 will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity or 
hematologic DLT , as per consensus recommendations for clinical trials in CLL and T-
LGL.  Determination of whether to hold pyrimethamine for hematologic toxicities will be 
determined in these patients on a case by [CONTACT_799621].  As in Section 5.4 following,  growth factor support and/or platelet 
transfusion are allowed at the investigator’s discretion.    
 
  Dose- limiting toxicities will be determined during the [ADDRESS_1102982] Cycle 1.  
Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6 (Expected Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications) . 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
14 Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort according to the following scheme.  
 
Number of Participants with DLT  
at a Given Dose Level   
Escalation Decision Rule  
 
0 out of 3 Enter 3 participants at the next dose level.  
                                  
                                 
                                  > 2 Dose escalation will be stopped. This dose 
level will be declared the maximally 
administered dose (highest dose 
administered). Three (3) additional participants will be entered at the next lowest 
dose level if only [ADDRESS_1102983] 3 more participants at this dose 
level.  
• If 0 of these 3 participants experience 
DLT, proceed to the next  dose level.  
• If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then 
dose escalation is stopped, and this dose is 
declared the maximally administered 
dose. Three (3) additional participants will be entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 participants  were treated 
previously at that dose.  
<[ADDRESS_1102984] be entered at the recommended Phase II 
dose.  
 
 5.4  General Concomitant  Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 Patients will receive the following additional supportive care medications:  
 
• Allopurinol [ADDRESS_1102985] has an allergy.  Subjects with T -
LGL are not required to receive allopurinol. 
 
• Anti-emetics may be prescribed as needed; no specific premedication is required 
or suggested.   
 
• Subjects who have been taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP 
prophylaxis should be assessed for their real risk of PCP.  Due to an increased risk 
of hypersensitivity reactions and/or myelosuppression when given together with 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
15 pyrimethamine, this medication should be discontinued if possible or changed to 
atovaquone or other equivalent PCP prophylaxis during the time on study therapy. 
 
• Subjects receiving acyclovir or equivalent prophylaxis should continue these 
medications.  Consideration should be given to initiating acyclovir prophylaxis at 
400 mg po TID (or equivalent) for those patients not yet receiving it.  
 
• Lorazepam given concurrently with pyrimethamine has been associated with an 
increased risk of transaminitis.  If substitution with another benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_799602], then that is preferred; otherwise close monitoring is appropriate. 
 
• All patients requiring transfusions should receive irradiated, leukopore filtered 
blood products. 
 
• Subjects may receive neupogen, peg filgrastim, erythropoietin  or related growth 
factors at the discretion of the treating physician.  Subjects in whom study therapy 
has been held due to myelosuppression may be given a short course of leucovorin 10 mg po QD, at the discretion of the treating physician in consultation with the Principal Investigator.  
• Because there is a potential for interaction of pyrimethamine  with other 
concomitantly administered drugs , especially sulfonamides or 
myelosuppressive drugs, the case report form must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 5.5 Duration of Therapy  
  
Initial response assessment will occur after 28 days of study therapy.  Those subjects with stable or responding disease may continue on study indefinitely if their treating physician and  the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_799603].  Subjects with significant adverse events or progressive disease should be removed from study. 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression 
and tolerance. In the absence of significant  adverse events, treatment may continue 
indefinitely  or until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression,  
• Intercurrent  illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or  
Pyrimethamine for CLL

render the participant  unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_99912] . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1102986] be documented in the study- specific case report form (CRF). 
Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating 
investigators must immediately notify the Principal Investigator (or Protocol Chair), Jennifer R Brown MD PhD  at [PHONE_16698].  
 
6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS   
 Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations, and as per Table 2, Section 6.3. Toxicity assessments for non -hematologic toxicities will be done using 
CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is identified and located on the CTEP website at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocol 
Development/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .   Please see below for appropriate evaluation of 
hematologic toxicities, which will be according to the IW -CLL 2008 criteria.   
 If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti- emetics, anti- diarrheals, etc.).  
 All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_234311], through the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contact[CONTACT_143027].    
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. [ADDRESS_1102987] of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the agents administered 
in this study appear below and will determine whether dose delays and modifications will be made or whether the  event requires expedited reporting in addition  to routine 
reporting.  
 
6.1.1   Adverse Event Lists(s) for  Pyrimethamine   
Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], erythema multiforme , and anaphylaxis), and hyperphenylalaninemia, 
can occur particularly when pyrimethamine  is administered concomitantly with a 
sulfonamide. Anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by [CONTACT_799622]; it usually disappears  promptly upon reduction of dosage. Higher 
doses may produce megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm. Hematologic effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals.  Pulmonary eosinophilia has been reported rarely . 
6.2 Toxicity Management  
  
Following the ingestion of 300 mg or more of pyrimethamine , gastrointestinal and/or 
central nervous system signs may be present, including convulsions. The initial 
symptoms are usually gastrointestinal and may include abdominal pain, nausea, severe and repeated vomiting, possibly including hematemesis. Central ne rvous system toxicity 
may be manifest by [CONTACT_799623], generalized and prolonged convulsions which may be followed by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_2341], circulatory collapse, and death within a few hours. Neurological symptoms appear rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (30 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion), suggesting that in gross overdosage pyrimethamine  has a direct toxic effect on the central 
nervous system.  The fatal dose is variable, with the smallest reported fatal single dose being [ADDRESS_1102988] effective in counteracting the effects on the hematopoietic system. Due to the long half- life of pyrimethamine , daily monitoring of 
peripheral blood counts is recommended for up to several weeks after the overdose until normal hematologic values are restored.  
6.3 Dose Modifications/Delays  
As no ted above, an individual patient who experiences DLT will have therapy held until 
resolution to grade 1 or less, and may then resume therapy at one dose level below their

Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
19 >= 500 – 1,000  3 50-74% 
< 500  4 >=75%  
 
 Subjects will not be evaluable for hematologic toxicity, hematologic dose -limiting 
toxicity or holding of therapy based on low ANC i f the starting ANC < 1 000 or the 
starting  ANC is greater than 1 000 with the assistance of growth factors .  The ANC may 
be supported by [CONTACT_799624].  In 
particular, LGL patients with pre -existing neutropenia will not be evaluable for toxicity 
related to neutropenia and may continue study drug at their assigned dose regardless of 
neutrophil count.  
 Subjects wi th baseline platelets < 20,[ADDRESS_1102991] s with baseline platelets ≥100,000 will be evaluated per CTEP Active Version of 
the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ; i.e, do not use the 
correctio n in the table above for assessing platelet toxicity when baseline platelets 
≥100,000. When baseline and Cycle 1 Day 1 ANC and/or platelets differ, the lower of the two values should be used for assessing DLT, dose modifications and hematologic toxicity.  
For subjects with initial ANC =/>1000, neutropenia grading will follow the table above 
and development of grade [ADDRESS_1102992] may  undergo a one dose level reduction in dose  at investigator discretion  
 
Thrombocytopenia will be graded based on the table above, using adjusted parameters for all subjects with a starting platelet count < 100,000.  For those subjects with a starting platelet 
count =/> 100,000, development of thrombocytopenia will be graded based on CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Cr iteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) .  Any 
subject with a starting platelet count < 20,[ADDRESS_1102993] with a starting pla telet count > 20,000, development of a platelet count < 20,000 
is considered grade 4 thrombocytopenia and will result in holding of study drug.  Consideration may be given to administration of folic acid or low-dose leucovorin.  Persistence of grade 4 thro mbocytopenia for > [ADDRESS_1102994] cycle .  If these subjects  experiencing 
DLT  are continued on study after resolution within one month, a dose reduction by [CONTACT_799625] v. 8 22JAN16      
20 level per the dose escalation table is required . If grade 4 thrombocytopenia persists for > 7 
days in cycle 2 or beyond, consideration may be given to a one dose level reduction, at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_799604].  
 
 6.3.2 Rash  
 
For grade 3 or greater  skin rash, study drug should be discontinued.  If the rash resolves 
(back to grade 1 or less, within 4 weeks) with supportive care and is not IgE mediated or 
accompanied by [CONTACT_799626], patients ma y resume study 
therapy at one lower dose level, or if already at the lowest dose level, may resume at that dose with addition of prophylactic antihistamine.  Consideration may be  given to use of a 
prophylactic antihistamine, particularly diphenhydramine , even in patients resuming at a 
reduced dose.   
 
6.3.3   Anorexia /Vomiting:  
 
For grades 1 -4 anorexia/vomiting, study drug should be continued with initiation of 
antiemetic  therapy .  If drug needs to be held until patient can tolerate drug with 
supportive care, patient may resume at same dose level.  If antiemetics do not bring relief, then the dose should be reduced one level . Patients with grade 3 or 4 anorexia/vomiting 
that do not respond to supportive care should be discontinued from study drug, but will remain on study for follow-up procedures until initiation of another therapy . 
 
7. DRUG FORMULATION AND ADMINISTRATION  
7.1 Pyrimethamine  
7.1.1 Description  
 
The chemical name [CONTACT_799638] 5- (4-chlorophenyl)- 6- ethyl -2,4-
pyrimidinediamine .  It acts as a folate antagonist and a STAT3 inhibitor.   
Pyrimethamine  is well absorbed orally with peak levels occurring between 2 to 6 hours 
following administration. It is eliminated slowly and has a plasma half -life of 
approximately 96 hours. Pyrimethamine  is 87% bound to human plasma proteins. 
7.1.2 Form  
 
Pyrimethamine is sup plied as  25 mg  tablets.  Depending on dose level, 0.5, 1 or 2 tablets 
will be taken by [CONTACT_799627].  Do not crush or chew.  *The [ADDRESS_1102995] Form (DARF) or another comparable drug accountability form. (See the CTEP home page at http://ctep.cancer.gov
 for the Procedures for Drug 
Accountability and Storage or to obtain a copy of the DARF.)  
7.1.7   Destruction and Return 
 Study drug for daily oral administration will be supplied by [CONTACT_799628] 25 mg 
table ts in bottles .  Drug accountability will be performed as per current DF/HCC SOP  All 
unused study drug should be returned  by [CONTACT_799629]/PA. 
At the end of the  study, unused supplies of pyrimethamine should be destroyed 
according to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the Drug 
Accountability Record Form.  
 
8. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
8.1  Pharmacokinetic Studies  
 
 
Pharmacokinetics will be performed to assess pyrimethamine accumulation over time, given the long half -life of the drug.  1 heparin -anticoagulated green top tube will be 
drawn prior to therapy, prior to dose on one of days 2-5 (optional)  and prior to dose on 
each subsequent clinic visit (weekly during cycle 1, every other week during cycle 2, and monthly thereafter  until discontinuation from study drug .  Pharmacoki netics will 
also be drawn at time of off study visit and once again 2- 4 weeks later if the patient has 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
22 not started additional therapy. These samples will be collected at all of the above 
timepoints and  transferred for processing and freezing. 
 PK samples are drawn, processed  and stored as follows:

[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
[ADDRESS_1102997]. Frank's lab.  
 Two 6  cc heparin -anticoagulated green top tubes (or equivalent) will be collected and 
transferred to Dr . David Frank’s lab on Mayer 5 on the following days /times : 
-Screening   
-Pre and two hours post drug on day 1 of cycle 1 -One day among Days 2-5 therapy (optional) -Day 8, 15, 22 cycle 1  -Day 1 and 15 cycle 2    -Day 1 of subsequent cycles up to cycle 6  -Off study visit 
-2-4 weeks after off study visit (if subsequent therapy has not begun) -3 month follow up appointment (if subsequent therapy has not begun)  
As outlined above, prior to initiating therapy, and at the time of each subseque nt clinic visit 
while on study, patients will have  approximately  10 ml of blood drawn into a heparinized 
tube.  Mononuclear cells will be isolated by [CONTACT_138789]-based density separation, and the proportion of CLL cells will be determined by [CONTACT_4133].  If greater than 90% of the isolated cells are CLL cells (CD5+CD19+CD20+), these will be used for subsequen t 
analyses.  If less than 90% display a CLL phenotype, then we will use antibody- based 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
23 magnetic cell separation to increase the purity to this level.  It will be necessary to isolate a 
minimum of 5 x 106 cells for the required analyses.  
 Cells will be anal yzed in two ways in parallel, as follows.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  STAT [ADDRESS_1102998] 
20.  This analysis will 
indicate the concordance of normalized expression of STAT3 target genes (as described below) with the level and phosphorylation of STAT3.  In addition, it will allow a longitudinal analysis of changes in the quantity and phosphorylation state of STAT3 in CLL cells of patients on pyrimethamine.  If pyrimethamine is decreasing the survival of CLL cells in these patients, then it will be expected that the total number of CLL cells will decline over time.  Furthermore, if CLL cells persist, it will allow a determination of whether a change in the proportion of CLL cells with activated STAT3 is occurring over time.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STAT [ADDRESS_1102999] of pyrimethamine dosing on STAT3-dependent gene expression, and a longitudinal analysis of STAT3 dependent gene expression with pyrimethamine treatment in individual patients.  Furthermore, in conjunction with the pharmacokinetic analyses described above, these studies will provide correlations between plasma 
concentrations of pyrimethamine and effects on STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 -dependent gene expression. 
   
8.3 Determination of CLL and T -LGL Biologic Prognostic Features 
 
For CLL patients, peripheral blood will be collected in two 6 cc green top tubes and one 6 cc red top tube prior to therapy on all DFCI patients, along with saliva under the 
auspi[INVESTIGATOR_799605] 01-206 or 99-224 (if the patient has a low white blood cell count, th en four 6 cc green top tubes will be collected instead). These samples can be 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
24 drawn at screening or Day 1 (prior to therapy).  The CLL Research Consortium Tissue 
Bank , our collaborator on Protocol 99-224, will determine IgVH mutational status 
and ZAP70 expression on all samples from DFCI subjects. This will be determined 
from three 6 cc green top tubes.   *BIDMC subjects are unable to be registered to 99-
224, but wi ll have three 6 cc green top tubes drawn as part of this protocol, and they 
will be banked here for prognostic factor measurements later.    
 In addition, and for all T- LGL patients,  two
 6 cc green tops & one 6 cc  red top will be 
used for banking of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the JFB 426 Brown lab, at screening and at day 15 of therapy  (if the patient has a low white blood cell count, 
then four 6 cc green top tubes will be collected instead).  For those patients seen at BIDMC, these green -topped tubes and red -topped tube will be collected as part of this 
protocol and transferred to  JFB426 Brown lab for banking.    The clinical flow cytometry laboratory will determine CD38 expression.  The DFPCC /BWH clinical cytogenetics laboratory will perform interphase FISH 
cytogenetics.   
 
 
9. STUDY CALENDAR

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT   
Responses will be formally assessed initially at the conclusion of the 1st 28 day cycle, then at the 
conclusion of three cycles (three months), and then every three months thereafter , until disease 
progression, start of another treatment, or death .  Response will be assessed in tw o ways:  (1) By 
[CONTACT_12134]-WG 1996 criteria3 (as updated in the IWCLL 2008 criteria Section 10.2)[ADDRESS_1103006] scans.  In this case lymph nodes will be assessed based on physical exam measurements; 
(2) With the incorporation of CT findings as suggested for clinical trials in IWC LL 2008.  Thus 
CT scans will be performed on all patients at the end of the 1st month, 3rd month and 6th month, if 
still on study  we will evaluate the impact of the CT scans (1) if used only to confirm CR; (2) if 
used to assess lymph adenopathy regardless of PE findings.  After the [ADDRESS_1103007] scans will generally not be done, but may be done at the discretion of the treating physician.  
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
27 Following the initial screening bone marrow biopsy, additional bone marrow biopsies will be 
performed o nly to confirm complete remission.    
T-LGL Response Criteria21: 
Response to treatment should be evaluated by [CONTACT_969], physical examination, and complete blood 
count with differential: 
●Complete response — A hematologic complete response is defined as the complete 
normalization of blood counts (ie, hemoglobin >12 g/dL;  platelets >150,000/microL; 
absolute neutrophil count >1500/microL; absolute lymphocyte count <4000/microL) in 
the setting of a circulating LGL count of less than 500/microL.  
●Partial response — A hematologic partial response is defined as an improvement in 
blood counts that does not meet criteria for complete remission (eg, an absolute 
neutrophil count >500/microL or decreasing transfusion requirements). 
●Treatment failure — Treatment failure is defined as an inability to achieve an at least 
partial response after four months of therapy. 
●Progressive disease — Progressive disease is defined as a worsening of cytopenias, 
hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly 
 
10.1  Progression- Free Survival  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to 
time of objective disease progression or death, whichever occurs earlier .

11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1General  
 
Adverse event collection and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. This study 
will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  that is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting//ctc.html
 and the IWCLL criteria for hematologic 
malignancies as outlined in Section 6.3.1.   
 Information on all adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_2299], directly observed, or detected by [CONTACT_5292], laboratory test or other means, will be collected, recorded, followed and reported as described in the following sections.   
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. [ADDRESS_1103009] dose of study 
medication. Participants who experience an ongoing adverse event related to a stu dy 
procedure and/or study medication beyond [ADDRESS_1103010]-study event(s) that might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the IRB and any other applicable regulatory agency of any unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after a participant has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to the study.  
 
11.2 Definitions  
 
11.2.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
  
An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
 
11.2.2 Serious A dverse E vent (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition 
which: 
• is fatal or life -threatening;  
• requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• jeopardizes the participant and requires medical  or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
 
11.2.3 Expectedn ess  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
30 [IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  
  
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigato r’s Brochure, the package insert or is 
included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of common expected adverse events 
associated with the study agent(s).   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unexpected adverse event  
  
For th e purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 
 
11.2.4 Attribution  
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

adverse events will be recorded on the appropriate study- specific case report forms 
(CRFs).  
 
11.4 Reporting Adverse Events  
 
Each adverse event will be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious 
adverse event. If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local policies, and federal guidelines and regulations as appropriate.  
 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
31 It is the responsibility of the participating investigator to notify the Principal

13.[ADDRESS_1103021] 3+3 dose-escalation design is used in the Phase I portion for assessing the 
safety and determining the MTD and recommended dose for the Phase II portion of this study of pyrimethamine in relapsed CLL/SLL  and T -LGL patients.   
 
14.1.2 Primary Objectives for Phase II Trial 
 
After MTD is established in Ph ase I, 20 additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase 
II study and treated with pyrimethamine at the MTD.  The primary objective for this portion of the study is to determine the overall response rate of pyrimethamine in these patients , including bot h CLL/SLL and T -LGL.   
 
14.[ADDRESS_1103022] 3+3 dose-escalation design is used, 
with 5 planned pyrimethamine dose levels (Section 5); the observation period is one cycle (28 days).  [ADDRESS_1103023] 3 patients, escalation stops.  If 1 DLT is observed, an 
additional 3 patients will be enrolled at the same dose level.  If no DLT is observed in the additional 3 patients, escalation proceeds.  If any DLTs are observed among the 3 additional patients, escalation stops.   
 
Based on this dose escalation scheme, the probability of escalating to the next dose level for various true underlying rates of DLT is given in Table 1. 
 
Table 1 Probability of Escalation for Various True Underlying DLT Rates for Pyrimethamine  
 
True DLT Rate  1.0%   10.0%  20.0%   30.0%   40.0%  50.0%   
 Probability of Escalation          0.99     0.91     0.71      0.49     0.31     0.17     
 
 
If the true underlying proportion of DLT is 30% at the current dose during the treatment period, there is a 49% chance of escalating to the next dose.  We anticipate that a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 1 2 additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase I 
portion of the study.   
  
14.2.2 Phase II 
 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
37 The Phase II portion is a single arm study which consists of determining the overall 
response rate of  pyrimethamine in relapsed CLL/SLL  and T- LGL patients.   The overall 
response rate is not expected to differ between these two diseases and therefore one overall response rate will be reported.   A 35% overall response rate will be considered 
promising.  The first response evaluation will be assessed after the first cycle of treatment then at the end of three cycles.   
 
Six Phase I patients treated at the MTD of pyrimethamine will be enrolled in the Phase II 
part of the study.  A Simon’s two stage opt imal des ign is used to compute the sample 
size.  A total number of [ADDRESS_1103024] a 35% response rate, assuming the ORR for the null hypothesis is 10% , with  90% power and 10% type I error.  
The study will stop early if only [ADDRESS_1103025] stage if the true ORR is less than 35% is 0.736.   
 
14.3 Primary Analysis 
 
The overall response rate and a 90% confidence interval will also be calculated, using the method of Atkinson and Brown for a two stage study.  Descriptive statistics for patients’ baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics (median, interquartile range, proportions).   
 
14.4 Secondary Objectives  
 
• To assess the toxicity profile of pyrimethamine in relapsed CLL/SLL  and T- LGL, 
both acutely and over prolonged daily dosing. 
• To determine pyrimethamine levels in vivo with prolonged dosing. 
• To determine the progression free and overall survival following pyrimethamine 
for the treatment of relapsed CLL/SLL  and T- LGL. 
• To determine whether pyrimethamine inhibits STAT3 in vivo by [CONTACT_799636]2 dependent gene expression in CLL cells and/or 
peripheral blood. 
• To determine whether known prognostic factors in CLL/SLL correlate with reponse to pyrimethamine . 
• To assess the impact of CT scans on respons e evaluation i n relapsed CLL/SLL  
and T- LGL. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_1103026] or Wilcoxon’s signed rank test, depending on the symmetry of the data, will be used 
in univariate analyses for continuous variables of gene expression data, based on the ratio of post- therapy to baseline expression.  Spearman’s correlation coefficients w ill be used 
Pyrimethamine for CLL  
Protocol v. 8 22JAN16      
38 for assessing relationships between continuous variables for some known prognostic 
factors and Fisher’s exact test will be used for finding associations between categorical variables.   
 
14.[ADDRESS_1103027] be assessed 
for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each participant should be assigned one of the following 
categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, 8) CRi or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.  
              
All of the participants who met the eligibility criteria  should be included in the 
main analysis of the response rate. Participants in response categories [ADDRESS_1103028] a treatment failure (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate .  If a bone marrow is not 
assessed at restaging it will be noted on the appropriate CRF, and an otherwise complete response would become a PR.  
   
15. PUBLICATION PLAN 
The results will be made public within approximately [ADDRESS_1103029] followed by a manuscript for a peer -reviewed 
journal.  This study will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov  after IRB approval and activation.

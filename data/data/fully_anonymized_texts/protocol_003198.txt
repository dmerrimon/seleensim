1. Change  (reduction)  from baseline to day 4 in respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
(Nasopharyngeal swab, saliva  RT-PCR)  log10 viral load . 
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
1. Change  (reduction)  from baseline to day 2 and to day 6  in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ( Nasopharyngeal swab, saliva  RT-PCR)  log10 viral load.  
2. Difference in rate of a positive COVID -[ADDRESS_161639] result at day 6, 14 
and 28  after enrollment  
3. Change of COVID -19 symptom score from baseline to day 6 and to 
14 
4. To assess the safety of camostat mesylate  200 mg po QID  
 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
1. Conversion of SARS -CoV-2 antigen detection  (Quidel’s Sofia 
assay)  from Nas opharyngeal specimens from baseline to days 6 
and 14 ;  there is no specific a priori  power analysis for this 
exploratory outcome because this assay is new (under an FDA 
EUA) and has not been used for serial assessment of outpatients  
and this exploratory analysis will provide data regarding the 
performance of this test in our outpatient c ontext.

 2 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
SARS -CoV-2, one of a family of human coronaviruses, was initially identified in December 2019 in Wuhan 
city.1 This new coronavirus causes a disease presentation which has now been named COVID -19. The virus 
has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by [CONTACT_142289] 11th March 2020. In the United State s, as of 12 Ap ril 2020, there were  532,339 confirmed 
cases with 21,418 deaths, with an estimated case -fatality rate of 4% for identified cases . At this time, there is 
no approved specific treatment for COVID -[ADDRESS_161646], then 
this drug would not be pursued for further clinical study.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Introduction  
SARS -CoV-2, one of a family of human coronaviruses, was initially identified in December 2019 in Wuhan 
city.2 This new coronavirus causes a disease presentation which has now been named COVID -19.3 The virus 
has subsequently spread throughout the world and was declared a pandemic by [CONTACT_142290] 11th March 2020. In the United State s, as of 12 April 2020, there were  532,339 confirmed 
cases with 21,418 deaths, yielding  an estimated case -fatality rate of 4% for identified cases (which is surely 
an underestimate).  Therapy for COVID -[ADDRESS_161647]  common  symptoms are fever, cough, 
myalgia and dyspnea, though some patients present with headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Viral 
pneumonia occurs in severe disease and leads to severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Overall estimation of 
mortality rates vary f rom 0.039 and 7%, depending on the efficiency of pop ulation -based RT -PCR testing  and 
and host demographic and baseline clinical status . 
 
SARS -CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as its cell entry receptor protein to access and 
infect hum an cells.4 The interaction between ACE2 and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_142266]2’s active site. This 
process critically uses the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal tract) surface -expressed serine 
protease TMPRSS2.4 Utilizing previous research on severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (SARS -
CoV) and the closely related SARS -CoV-2 cell entry mechanism, it has been demonstrated that SARS -CoV-2 
cellular entry can be blocked by [CONTACT_142291] (Foipan, Ono Pharm aceuticals) in vitro.5 In vivo, using  a 
strain of SARS -Cov-1 adapted to causing lethal disease in a mouse model, camostat mes ylate dosed at a 
concentration similar  to the clinically  achievable  concentration  in humans  reduced  mortality  following  SARS -CoV 
infection from 100% to  30-35% in this model.  
 
Rationale for choice of study drug  
Camostat mes ylate is a proteolytic enzyme inhibitor that is used primarily in the treatment of postoperative reflux 
esophagitis and for acute , symptomatic exacerbations  of chronic pancreatitis.[ADDRESS_161648] of camostat mesylate on viral kinetics of SARS -
CoV-2 in newly diagnosed COVID -19 in  ambulatory patients. There are two arms named A and B. Arm A is the 
camostat mesylate arm which will provide drug in identical appearance as placebo by [CONTACT_142292]. Patients 
in group A will rece ive 200 mg camostat mesylate to be taken four times daily. Arm B  is the placebo arm and will 
be given YNHH research pharmacy -formulated placebo 4 times a day. All patients will receive treatment or 
placebo for a total of 7 days.

 There is no clinical experi ence in using camostat mesylate in humans to treat SARS -CoV-2. Camostat mesylate, 
approved for clinical use in Japan since 2006, has been used there for more than two decades to treat reflux 
esophagitis  and acute -on-chronic pancreatitis , and it displays very little  toxicit y (detailed  below) . In animal studie s, 
treatment with comparable human dosing reduces mortality (100% to 35% within the study period of 13 days) in 
mice exposed to SARS -CoV.

Camostat mesylate in COVID -19 Outpatients  Version 8.0 
Protocol  #[PHONE_3175]  [ADDRESS_161650] an EC 50 of 87nM in vitro ,  a peak concentration achievable 
with oral camostat mesylate administration.6 
Camostat mesylate  is immediately  and extensively hydrolysed in plasma to 4 -(4-guanidinobenzoyl -
oxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA (FOY -251)), which is further degraded to 4 -guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA). CM 
and GBPA have similar biological activity, while GBA is inactive.  
Indication of absorption fraction after oral dosing  is not available.  
The Japanese  manufacturer’s  summary of product characteristics  describes  a study in five healthy, fasting 
adults of a single oral dose of 200 mg. For GBPA Tmax is 40 min, Cmax 87.1 ng/ml,  AUC 10,400 ng*min/ml 
and T½ 100min. Another study of four patients with complete gastrectomy given a single dose of 100 mg 
shows similar plasma curve changes including Cmax 30 ng/ml.  
In another study, four healthy Caucasian males received a single dose of  40 mg camostat mesylate  as 
intravenous infusion over 12 hours. The parent compound was not measurable in plasma, supportive of 
instantaneous degradation. PK parameters for the active metabolite, GBPA, were T max 300 min (after 
infusion start), C max 89.4 ng /ml, C ss 83.6 ng/ml, AUC 966 ng.h/ml and T ½ 1.0 hrs.  
In a study of pancreatic function, twelve healthy individuals (6M/6F, median age 24.5 yrs) were given 500 
mg four times daily for four weeks. Steady state concentration  for GBPA at the end of week 1 -4 were 19 ,600 
ng/ml, 18 ,600 ng/ml, 19 ,000 ng/ml and 14 ,400 ng/ml.  
Camostat mesylate  is almost ex clusively metabolized to GBPA and further on to GBA, by [CONTACT_142293]. Neither parent compound nor metabolites  affect CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 
or CYP3A4. Excretion is mainly renal as GBA (>95%).  
The main metabolites of CM are renally eliminated, predominately 4 -guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA) and to a 
much lesser extent 4 -(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic aci d (GBPA). After a single oral administration of 
[ADDRESS_161651] chronic pancreatitis in a western population, 
excludes patients with CKD stage IV (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1,73m2)15. This suggests that prior studies could 
potentially have documented the sa fety of CM use in patients with milder degrees of renal impairment.  
In PK simulation modeling  provided recently by 
[CONTACT_142294], the new FDA suggested 
dosing of 200 mg QID of camostat would yield the 
following curves and time of blood levels 
exceed ing the 87 nM EC 50. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interactions with other  drugs  
There are no known interactions with other drugs and CM, GBA, GBPA. The drug and metabolites are not 
dependent on CYP metabolism.

Camostat mesylate in COVID -19 Outpatients  Version 8.0 
Protocol  #[PHONE_3175]  [ADDRESS_161652]  2020  
 
Page 12 of 47 
 Others  - Edema 
Hypoglycemia  - 
 
Table 1. Summary of Safety Data for Camostat Mes ylate tablets  
Data summarized from the use of camostat mesylate for the indications of “Remission of acute symptoms of 
chronic pancreatitis” (83 ARs including abnormal lab.values observed in 69 (1.8%) of 3,806 patients) and 
“Postoperative reflux esophagitis” (75 ARs including abnormal lab.values observed in 57 (1. 3%) of 4,224 
patients).  
Additional clinically significant ARs that may occur (incidences unknown*):  
Shock or anaphylactoid symptoms, thrombocytopenia, hepatic function disorder or jaundice, hyperkalaemia.  
*Incidence unknown: ADRs classified and collected f rom spontaneous reports . 
Two case reports have been found. One about autoimmune hepatitis that may have occurred following drug -
induced liver injury that may have been related to camostat treatment. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_142268], but  low dose of corticosteroids completely cured the liver function17. Another case study 
reported eosinophilic pneumonia probably caused by 10 days treatment with camostat. The peripheral blood 
eosinophilia and eosinophilic infiltration into the alveolar spa ce improved with the cessation of the drug18. 
Relevant monitoring of treatment is based on the knowledge about the reported clinically significant adverse 
reactions, which comprises: hyperkalemia, hepatic function disorder or jaundice, thrombocytopenia, 
eosinophilic pneumonia and shock/anaphylactic symptoms.  
Safety in patients with reduced renal output or end -stage renal  disease  
Human data on camostat mesylate treatment and renal insufficiency.  
Three studies have been found in Medline an d/or Embase that address the safety of camostat mes ylate 
administration in patients with renal insufficiency:  
1. Onbe et al. J Diabet Complications 1991;5:167 -8. 8 pts with ne phrotic syndrome and diabetic nephropathy. 
CM 600 mg daily for 4 weeks. Reduced prot einuria, creatinine clearance stable throughout study.  
 
2. Ikeda et al. J Diabetes Complications 1999;13:56 -8 
3 pts with ne phrotic syndrome and diabetic nephropathy. CM 600 mg daily for 4 weeks. 
Reduced proteinuria, no side effects reported.  
 
3. Matsubara et al.  Clin Nephrol 1989;32:[ADDRESS_161653] of camostat mesylate on renal function. Camostat mesylate admini stration was 
also not associated with an increased risk of adver se drug reactions.  
 
In Japan, th e approved doses for Foipan  are 100 mg three times daily for postoperative reflux esophagitis 
and 200 mg three times daily for symptoms of chronic pancreatitis.  We propose in the present study  dosing 
at 200 mg po QID, for which Ono has obtained safety data in early clinical trials (see below) .5 We will ask 
subjects to space out  dosing over 24 hours as much as they can, taking sleep into account.  
 
Camostat mesylate in COVID -19 Outpatients  Version 8.0 
Protocol  #[PHONE_3175]  [ADDRESS_161654] been used in some studies without any severe adverse effects, i.e. 9 patients with 
severe oral carcinomas up to 7.2 g daily for several months as well as a study i n healthy individuals of 2 g 
daily for four week s.  
Since use of the compound in SARS -CoV-2 setting is unchartered territory, we will use doses that are safe 
within the limits of the SmPC for camostat mes ylate. In cell lines, camostat seems able to inhibit the serine -
protease mediated maturation of the SARS Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]  (S) protein. EC 90 is about 5 uM and EC 50 about 1 uM in 
that study.  A more recent in vitro study showed an  EC 50 of 0.087 uM (87 NM).6 In a mouse model of SARS -
CoV-1 (the first SARS) virus, camostat  mesylate (30 mg/kg x2) ameliorated progression to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS). The reduction was from 100% to 35% lethality in the mouse model.8, 9 
The rationale for the duration of treatment with camostat mesylate (i.e. 200 mg QID daily for 7 days) is in 
part based on the current treatment guidelines for other lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_142269] -CoV-[ADDRESS_161655] recommendation is 
Tamiflu (oseltamiv ir 75 mg x  2) for [ADDRESS_161656] 
infections of similar disease severity.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
The risks of camostat mesylate (FOIPAN) are based on the package insert provided by [CONTACT_142295].[ADDRESS_161657] 7 days of participation in the study, minimal significant risks, either immediate or long -range risks to 
participants are anticipated f rom the physical, psychological, social, legal, economic, or other  viewpoints by 
[CONTACT_142296] ( PI) can f oresee . Potential risks during the acute phase of 
COVID -19 infection and coming to the designated facility ( outpatient  study site ) might be infection from others, or 
study personnel being exposed to active COVID -19 patients. These risks are mitig ated by [CONTACT_142297]&S during the  first week of study 
participation , during which time they interact with study personnel obtaining respi[INVESTIGATOR_142270]. Study personnel 
obtaining swabs will be dressed in YNHH system -approved PPE (N95 masks, goggles, face masks, gowns, 
gloves), and will change gowns, gloves, PPE sleeves between patients, as is standard practice.  
 
At days 14 +/-2 and 2 8+/-[ADDRESS_161658] blood tests (CBC and chemistries) plus that  for research use. A  
maximum  total of 125 mL of blood will be obtained at these two time points.  
 
The guidance for maximum volume of blood draws that will be applied is for non -healthy adults, no more than 
2.5% total blood volume in 24 -period and no more than 5% total blood volume in 30 days. 70mL/kg must be used 
to calculate the appropriate blood draw volume per patient. The two blood draws of maximum 125 mL  each for a 
total of 250 over two week s, plus 30 ccs per visit for Visits 1 -4  for a study total of 370ccs is still within the 
allowable amount.  
 
 
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
The anticipated potential benefits of receiving camostat mesylate treatment for patients with COVID -19 would be 
reduction of viral replication, which would be presumed to accelereate the reduction of COVID -19 disease 
symptomatology and reduce the contagiousness of the causative virus to others.

 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
To determine whether camostat 
mesylate reduces SARS -COV -2 viral 
load  within 2 -3 days after 
laboratory -confirmed diagnosis of 
COVID -19 disease  in ambulatory 
patients.  
 Primary Endpoint:  
1. Change (reduction) from 
baseline  to day 4  in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ( Nasopharyngeal 
swab , saliva  RT-PCR) log [ADDRESS_161661] 
samples would be  
expected to  be 
associated with anti -
viral activity of the 
study drug, and would 
be expected to be 
associated with 
continued reduction of 
viral load during drug 
administration, hence 
potential r educ tion 
severity of COVI D-19 
disease  and r educ tion 
of  transmission by 
[CONTACT_142298].  
 
If we are able to 
achieve a reduction in 
viral load   then a trial 
with clinical endpoints 
such as risk for 
progression to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or 
need for intensive unit 
care would be justified.  
 
Secondary    
1. To determine whether camostat 
mesylate reduces SARS -COV -2 viral 
load within 7 days after laboratory -
confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19 
disease in ambulatory patients.  
 1. Change from baseline  to day  2 and  
to day  6 in respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
(Nasopharyngeal swab , saliva  RT-
PCR) log [ADDRESS_161662] at day 6, 14 and 28   
 As for the primary 
endpoints (above).  
 
We expect to see a 
time -dependent 
reduction of viral load, 
hence the second time 
point.

Protocol  #[PHONE_3175]  [ADDRESS_161663] of 
camostat mesylate on COVID -19 
symptom score.  
 
 
 
3. To evaluate the safety of 
camostat mesylate  
 
4. Adverse events  
 
 3. Change of COVID -19 symptom 
score from baseline, to days 6 and 14  
 
Assessment of safety by [CONTACT_142299], according to  
The Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE) Version 5.0.   
We expect to see a 
reduction in symptom 
score from baseline at 
day 6 and day 14 +/ -2. 
 
If the secondary 
endpoints are not 
achieved,  then a trial 
to examine the effect  
of camostat mesylate 
on COVID -19 would not 
be justified.  
 
Tertiary/Exploratory    
To determine clinical outcome of  
COVID -19 treated with camostat 
mesylate  
 
To determine conversion of SARS -
CoV-2 antigen from positive at 
baseline to negative at days 6 and 
14. As an exploratory endpoint in 
comparing treatment to placebo 
groups, we will assess time to clinical 
improvement and risk for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .   
 
Quidel ’s Sofia assay will be used for 
antigen detection.  A tertiary objective not 
powered by [CONTACT_15365]. 
We will explore , 
however, whether  the 
treatment group 
clinically improves or 
has a lower, neutral, or 
greater risk of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
 
As the Quidel assay has 
not been used for 
serial assessment of 
outpatients , this 
exploratory analysis 
will provide data 
regarding the 
performance of thi s 
test in our outpatient 
context

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
The scientific integrity of the trial and the credibility of the data from the trial depend substantially on the trial 
design . A description of the trial design should be consistent with the Protocol Synopsis (section 1.1) and Protocol 
Schema (section 1.2)  and include:  
 
Hypothesis :  Camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor shown to inhibit SARS -COV -2 replication in vitro  and to reduce 
mortality in a mouse model of SARS , inhibits SARS -COV -2 replication in early stage, laboratory -confirmed, ambulatory 
COVID -19 patients.  
 
Trial phase : This is a phase II trial of camostat mesylate, a drug approved for clinical use in Japan for treatment of 
pancreatitis and postoperative reflux esophagitis.  
 
Trial design : Randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial  
 
Methods to minimize bias: Participants will be randomized equally to camostat mesylate or identical appearing placebo 
using a permuted -block design with variable block size. Actual treatment ass ignment will be concealed from the 
investigators and the participants.  
 
Number of study groups/arms and study intervention duration:  Two arms: Group A, study drug (camostat 
mesylate); Group B, placebo. Duration of study: 7 days. Duration of involvement by  [CONTACT_4317]: 28 days.  
 
Number of  Sites: one  
 
Name [CONTACT_64499] : Camostat mesylate  
 
Stratification:  None   
 
4.[ADDRESS_161665] be studied. Because respi[INVESTIGATOR_142271] (orders of 
magnitude ranging from 102-109/swab) among COVID -19-affected individuals, in order to demonstrate an 
antiviral effect of any drug on SARS -CoV-2, serial samples and measurement of viral load on respi[INVESTIGATOR_142272]. We will also perform viral load testing on saliva 
because recent studies have suggested that saliva may be more reliable; however the nasopharyngeal swab 
remains the gold standard. Because enrollment will be based on an initial positive COVID -[ADDRESS_161666] dose of camostat mesylate  as approved in Japan for patients with chronic pancreatitis  is 
600mg/da y (200 mg po tid) . We will increase the dose to 800mg/day  (200 mg po QID) which has been shown to 
be safe . This choice of dosage is consistent with PK simulation data (shown above) and Ono’s safety data as seen 
below, and the FDA IND approval letter suggested a dose of 800mg/day (200 mg po QID). The pla cebo control 
will be produced by [CONTACT_142300][INVESTIGATOR_142273] a look -alike.   
 
Camostat mesylate in COVID -19 Outpatients  Version 8.0 
Protocol  #[PHONE_3175]  [ADDRESS_161667] scheduled procedure shown in the S chedule of Activities (SoA), Section 1.[ADDRESS_161668] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Be enrolled  within [ADDRESS_161669] one COVID -19-compatible symptom such as fever, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], cough, 
chills, loss of taste/smell, etc.(see  COVID -19-PRO symptom score sheet), or a recent high -risk exposure 
to COVID -[ADDRESS_161670] 3 days and not exhibiting manifestations requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_142274]. Nurses at the study site will assess such 
severe conditions requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], which would preclude enrollment.  
7. Ability to take oral medication and be willing to adhere to the camostat mesylate  regimen . 
8. For men and women  of reproductive potential : use of  condoms  or other methods to ensure effective 
contraception with partner  during study drug administration.  
9. Agreement to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations (birth control measures) throughout the 7 -day duration 
of study drug administration.  
10. English and Spanish spea king subjects  as well as patients speaking any language for which we can find 
appropriate translators  will be enrolled . A short form with interpretation will be used for anyone  
speaking  a language for which a translated informed consent form is not  currently available   in 
accordance with local site IRB policies, including developi[INVESTIGATOR_142275].

5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
 
1. Presence of COVID -[ADDRESS_161672] without a known recent exposure that would indicate an active infection , hence 
an unknown chance of non-culturable, non -replicating virus being present (i.e., asymptomatic COVID -19 
infection of unknown duration)  
4. Known pr egnancy or lactation ; a positive urine pregnancy test done at the  enrollment ( day 0 visit ) for 
women with child bearing potential.  
5. Known  allergic reactions to components of camostat mesylate.  
 
With regard to inclusion or exclusion of women of child -bearing potential , women who tell us they know 
they are pregnant are excluded.  All women of child -bearing potential who test positive for pregnancy by 
[CONTACT_142301]. A day [ADDRESS_161673] will be done on appropriate 
enrolled women  (i.e. those who had a negative urine pregnancy test on day [ADDRESS_161674] two forms of birth control 
during the 7 days of study drug/placebo administration, including  but not limited to abstinence from sexual 
intercourse, condom use and/or using oral contraceptives.  
 
During this study , participants are asked to  comply with State public health requirements and the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control and Pre vention in terms of social distancing and discontinuing home isolation ( 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/disposition -in-home -patients.html  ), which will be provided in 
written form to participants.  
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
The study design is expected to minimize screen failures because enrollment will be based on consecutive ly 
diagnosed  COVID -19+ individuals. Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the 
clinical trial but are not subsequently randomly assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A 
minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure tra nsparent reporting of screen failure 
participants , to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure detai ls, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_161675] prevail for recruitment and retention in this study given the contagiousness potential 
of COVID -19.

 Dispensing : 
For dispensing, 8 capsules of overencapsulated Camostat 200 mg  per capsule  or identically 
appearing Placebo for camostat mesylate 200 mg will be packaged in a polypropylene bottle and 
given to enrolled research participants every other day . The bottles will be labeled with 
dispensing label  containing patient name, administration instructions, and provider information 
per state pharmacy regulations.   
 
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Consecutive  consenting  COVID -19+ patients will be recruited as participants, who will be 
randomized equally to camostat mesylate or placebo using a permuted -block design with variable 
block size. Actual treatment assignment will be double -blind, concealed from the investigators 
and the participants. The YCCI statistical group (YCAS) will generate the randomization scheme 
and provide it to the pharmacy. Research pharmacy staff will prepare study drug and placebo for 
dispensing and assign and record  which subject are assigned to recei ve them.  The study site 
team will record what each participant  receives according to assigned kit #.  
 
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
 
The study design is buil t around obtaining  respi[INVESTIGATOR_142278].  To 
encour age compliance with study protocol, study drug/placebo will be provided every other day 
(prior to swabbing  and saliva collection ) and verbal  assessment of whether study drug/placebo 
was taken as prescribed will be done.  
 
Participants will have the option of not being swabbed again  or providing saliva , even after 
receiving study drug, but lack of day 0 and 4 NP swabs  would be a protocol deviation  although 
they would be retained in intention to treat analysis.  NP swabs are required at days 0, 4, 14, 28; 
optional swabs at days 2 and 6.  Saliva will be collected at all study visits.  
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 
Medications to be reported in the Case Report Form ( CRF) are concomitant prescription 
medications  (oral and parenteral) , over -the-counter medications and supplements . There are no 
restrictions.  We will track all concom itant medications that subjects take.

 7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION 
Reasons why a study subjects may be withdrawn from the study intervention include, but are 
not limited to: 
Subject request (withdrawal of consent) 
Protocol violation, i.e. declining to take drug  or be swabbed or providing saliva for viral 
load two times. 
AE or reactions 
Any condition, interaction, or contraindication where continued participation 
in the study will result in an unacceptab le risk for the subject, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_142305] 
Discontinuation of the study by [CONTACT_1034] 
Lost to follow-up 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
 
Participants are free to withdraw from partic ipation in the study at any time upon request. 
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following 
reasons: 
 
xPregnancy 
 
xSignificant study interven tion non-compliance  
 
xIf any clinical adverse event (A E) or other medical condition or situation occurs such that 
continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant 
 
xDisease progression which requires discon tinuation of the study intervention 
xIf the participant meets an exclusion criterion  (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation 
xParticipant unable to receive study intervention  
xThe reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be 
recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who provide informed consent and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced. Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study will be replaced.

The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_142306]/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or  designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls 
and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_21457]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up.

8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
At  study visits, vital signs including pulse oximetry will be obtained. Physical examination will not be 
performed routinely on participants unless dictated by [CONTACT_142312] . Any patient experiencing 
symptoms requiring medical examination will be referred to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]..  
 
On all study days, participants will be asked to answ er specific questions that relate to known potential 
adverse effects of camostat mesylate. The previously determined  incidence of adverse effects (when 
drug administered for  at least two weeks ) are:  
 
Symptom  0.1 to 0.5%  <0.1%   
Rash  0.4   
Pruritus  0.2%    
Gastrointestinal  
 0.1 to 0.5 % 
(nausea, abdominal 
discomfort or 
fullness, diarrhea)  Anorexia, vomiting, 
dry mouth, 
heartburn, abdominal 
pain, constipation   
 
Included in the informed consent form are concerns about rare side effects. Study personnel will 
specifically elicit whether there are symptoms concerning for severe allergy such as jaundice, 
anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions will be determined on a d aily basis by [CONTACT_142313] (yellow eyes, weakness, wheezing, shortness of breath, tongue swelling, 
hives, rash) during the first 7 days of the study. Laboratory evidence of adverse effects such as 
thrombocytopenia, hyper bilirubinemia, or hyperkalemia will only be able to be determined at day 14.  
 
Participants will be informed on study day 28 of all  available research -specific  study results to date . 
Results that return after day 28 will be communicated with the partici pant within 2 weeks of such 
results.  If there are actionable results of routin e/standard of care  lab tests including  CBC, chemistries  
and coagulation studies, t hey will be reported to participants in a timely manner, otherwise they will be 
discussed at the day 28 visit  or if they become available after day 28, within 2 weeks of when new 
results become available . 
   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0  will be used to characterize 
adverse events.  
 
The study involves a  repurposed drug in routine clinical use in Japan and is a n investigational new drug in 
the [LOCATION_002].  
 
The study involves  the use of placebo in a population with diagnosed COVID -19, which is justified 
because there is no drug approved for its treatment, nor is there a current outpatient study for treatment 
of diagnosed COVID -19.

8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
 
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
Adverse events in this study will be assessed by [CONTACT_142314] , and specifically sought according to the 
approval package insert.  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
An adverse event ( AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investig ator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may j eopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home , blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0  will be used to characterize 
adverse events.  
 
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and  do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a partici pant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating . Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.

Page 29 of 47 
  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree o f certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the st udy intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigator team  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is 
expected or unexpected . An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the ev ent is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention  (i.e. 
the package insert approved in Japan) . 
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting t he criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_142315] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition  that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
 
Camostat mesylate in COVID -19 Outpatients  Version 8.0 
Protocol  #[PHONE_3175]  [ADDRESS_161691] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed 
consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study 
participation . At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurre nce of AE/SAEs since the 
last visit . Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_161692] all adverse events and report them to the sponsor according to the timetable for reporting specified 
in the protocol . 
All AEs will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB, and investigators in accordance with  all local 
applicable laws and regulations.  
 
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
The study clinician (s) will report to the Sponsor -Investigator  within [ADDRESS_161693] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonab le 
possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events 
(e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence 
suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from 
anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigat or 
deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event 
may be requested by [CONTACT_8704].  
 
The Sponsor -Investigator  will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible , but in no case later 
than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt  of the information  and within 15 days for all other 
serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs ), in an Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety 
report .

8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
 
Given that the duration of study drug administration is one week,  a new  pregnancy is unlikely to be 
reported. If so, the participant so reporting a new pregnancy will be stopped from receiving study 
drug/placebo. Other followup may be continued.

 8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, s everity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
particip ant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156] ); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
 
The investigator  will repor t unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and t o the lead principal investigator ( PI). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or  outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following time line:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study 
sponsor within 2 days  of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within <insert timeline in 
accordance with policy>  of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_125133] n’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within 2 days .

significantly greater change from baseline to day s 2 and  6 in respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ( nasopharyngeal swab , saliva  
RT-PCR) log 10 viral load compared to placebo; that camostat mesylate will reduce log10 of a positive 
COVID19 test at day s 2 and 6 (optional swab s), rate of positive tests at days 6 , 14 (required), and 28 
(required) ; and that camostat mesylate will result in lower symptom burden at days [ADDRESS_161698]: change in log 10 respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
(nasopharyngeal swab, saliva  swab RT -PCR) viral load  from baseline to day [ADDRESS_161699] size of 0.3 using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
adjusting for baseline log [ADDRESS_161700] deviation of 5.0. 
(NOTE: For ANCOVA, the effect size is the standard deviation o f the treatment means divided by [CONTACT_142316].)  To be conservative we assume a R -squared of 0 
between the log 10 viral RNA at 4-days and baseline log 10 viral RNA.  With a power of 90%, and a type I 
error rate of 10%  (2-sided), we would be able to detect the hypothesized 0.[ADDRESS_161701] size with 
98 total patients -  49 patients per group with a 1:1 randomization.  Increasing this sample size by 15%, 
5% for an efficacy and futility look at 50% information (i.e . when half of the patients have been enrolled) 
and 10% to account for loss to follow up, gives a total of 114 participants (57 per treatment arm).  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
 
Intention -to-Treat Analysis Dataset: Participants will be analyzed based on their treatment assignment.  
 
Per Protocol Analyses Dataset:  All participants completing the study who complied with the protocol.  
 
Safety Analysis Dataset: all study participant s. 
 
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
All primary analyses will be performed as intent -to-treat analyses with a type I error rate of 10% (two -
sided).  Parametric distributional assumptions will be checked. If assumptions fail, other distributions will 
be considered prior to transformations and  non-parametric methods. SAS (version 9.4) or the latest 
version of R (currently 3.6.3) will be used to analyze the data.

Page 33 of 47 
  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
The primary analysis will be according to intent -to-treat and conducted using ANCOVA, a djusting for 
baseline log 10 viral load  (or conversion from Ct value assuming 1 log 10 = 3.3 Ct units) . We will use the t -
statistic for the treatment effect to determine whether the treatment is statistically different from the 
placebo at the overall 10% level of significance, controlling for baseline log 10 viral load. Because of the 
interim analysis  (see below), a p -value of 0.06 (2 -sided), corresponding to an efficacy boundary value of 
1.[ADDRESS_161703] of missing data. Sensitivity analyses under either missing at random or missing not at random 
will be considered, as appropriate.  
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Secondary outcomes of interest include: change in log 10 respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (nasopharyngeal swab , saliva  RT-
PCR) viral load  from baseline  (day 0)  to day s [ADDRESS_161704] -randomization; log [ADDRESS_161705] at day 6 , 14 and 28 ; and change of COVID -19 symptom score from baseline  (day 0) , as 
measured at days 6 and 14 +/ - 2 days after enrollment  (day 0) . The same ANCOVA analysis as proposed 
for the primary endpoint will be used to analyze two and six day change in log [ADDRESS_161706] binomial 
distribution. Linear mixed models will be used to describe trajectories of change in the symptom  score. 
The models will include fixed effects for treatment, time and the interaction of treatment and t ime. An 
unstructured covariance pattern will allow for correlation between repeated observations. Differences 
in means at each timepoint will be estimated along with 90% confidence intervals. All statistical tests 
will be conducted at 10% level of signific ance (two -sided) with no adjustment for multiple testing.   
 
The COVID -[ADDRESS_161707] entirely from a validated  influenza symptom 
scoring. Tool (FLU -PRO) 10 consists of 39 items that are answered daily. Items 1 -33 are Lik ert scale 
questions (rated 0 -4) where 0 = not at all ,11, 12  and 4 = very much. These items are summed to score 
the severity of symptoms - where a total score of [ADDRESS_161708] severity of symptoms 
and a score of 0 would indicate no severity of symptoms. Items 34 -38 are also Likert scale questions 
(rated 0 -4) that measure the frequency of specific daily symptoms where 0 = 0 times and 4 = [ADDRESS_161709] score for the 
frequency of symptoms (20) indicates the greatest burden of symptom frequency. The last question (39) 
asks patients for their highest temperature in Fahrenheit.  
 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
Safety will be reported by [CONTACT_142317] (means and standard deviations or 
frequencies and counts) and assessed by [CONTACT_142318] I error of 5% (2 -sided); no contr ol for multiplicity will be done for safety outcomes.  We will 
consider Wilcoxon rank sum tests or two -sample t -tests for continuous outcomes and the exact binomial 
distribution for proportions.

Interim monitoring for safety, efficacy and futility will be conducted. When 50% of the participants have 
accumulated the primary endpoint, we will conduct an interim a nalysis to assess for efficacy and futility 
using the group sequential method with asymmetric boundaries.  We will use a Pocock boundary for 
efficacy and will consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_142281] t -statistic for the treatment effect is greater

10.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS   
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and  documentation of informed consent is required prior to administering study 
intervention .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Obtaining and documenting informed consent. Due to  the contagiousness of COVID -19 patients  and the 
desire to minimize face -to-face time between staff and subjects ,  the process of obtaining written 
informed consent will be carried out as follows. 1) Prior to the first study visit, a member of th e study 
team will contact, by [CONTACT_756], the potential participant on the basis of a positive COVID -[ADDRESS_161713] and 
explain the study, according to the attached script. 2) The informed consent form will be provided by 
[CONTACT_142320] , or provided in paper form if the participant prefers 
at the first study visit  for discussion . 3) On arrival to the first study visit, the participant will again provide 
verbal assent and will receive a written informed consent form. Verbal assent will be witnessed by a 
health care worker and/or a study researcher, recorded, and entered into the participant’s electronic 
medical record (EPIC).  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the i ndividual’s agreeing to participate in the

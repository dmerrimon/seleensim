SCHEMA 
 
Design Overview:    This phase I/II investigator sponsored study will consist of a phase I 
portion (N= maximum of 24 patients) that evaluates an initial dosing 
schedule (Schedule A) followed by a more intense dosing schedule 
(Schedule B) at the same dose of selinexor.  Once the optimal schedule is 
determined, the phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of this schedule in 
40 patients (inclusive of 12 phase I patients), for a maximum total study 
population of 52 patients.  Optional maintenance phase of single-agent 
selinexor is also allowed.  All dosing cycles are 28 days long and the DLT 
evaluation period for phase I is during Cycle 1 of Schedules A and B.  
Prolonged myelosuppression, i.e., marrow cellularity < 5% on Day 42 or 
later (6 weeks) from start of Cycle 1 without any evidence of leukemia, 
will also be considered a DLT. 
 
The phase I study uses a Bayesian design and allows for a 6 patient 
schedule de-escalation cohort in addition to the dosing of 6 patients on 
each schedule. The phase II portion was designed to compare the primary 
endpoint of complete remission rate (CR + CRi) with an historical rate of 
33%.  With a sample size of 40, it will have 80% power (0.05 significance 
level) to detect a difference from the historical rate if the study observes a 
CR/CRi rate ≥ 0.55. 
 
Phase I Schedule A:  Selinexor will be dosed on Days 1, 5, 10, and 12 of 
the 28-day cycle.  All doses will be 60 mg each. 
 
Phase I Schedule B:  Selinexor will be dosed on Days 1, 5, 10, 12, 17, and 
19 of the 28-day cycle.  All doses will be 60 mg each. 
 
Phase II:  Selinexor will be given at the schedule as determined in phase I.   
 
Selinexor (S): Selinexor will be administered at 60 mg PO  
Cladribine (CL):  5 mg/m2/day IV once daily on Days 4-8 
G-CSF (G): 300 mcg SC once daily on Days 3-8  
Cytarabine (A): 2000 mg/m2/day IV once daily on Days 4-8  
Bone marrow 
biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] 
(BM):  Will be performed at baseline/screening, on Day 3, at the time of 
hematopoietic recovery, and as clinically indicated to assess treatment 
response. Additionally, samples will be banked for genomic studies 
indicated to document p resence of persistent disease.  
Peripheral blood 
(PB): Will be performed at baseline/screening, on Day 3, on Day 5, on Day 
7, and at the time of hematopoietic recovery.  
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 4 of 61   
The initial cohort of patients (N=6) will be dosed according to Schedule A.  If dose limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) are not experienced with the initial cohort of patients, then dosing will be 
intensified whereby a further cohort of patients (N=6) will be treated with Schedule B dosing. 
The phase II dosing schedule will be the most intense schedule in which ≤3 DLTs are observed 
in 12 patients treated using that schedule. Patients in the phase I portion of the study treated at 
the MTD will count towards the phase II accrual goal for evaluation of the primary endpoint.   
Phase II will include a sample size of 40 patients.

maintenance therapy with selinexor, a bone marrow biopsy must confirm the presence of the CR 
or CRi. Maintenance therapy consists of 60mg selinexor on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 day 
cycle (4 doses per cycle), continuously until disease relapse, unacceptable toxicity, death, or the 
institution of additional antileukemic therapy including stem cell transplantation or donor

 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
 Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a heterogeneous group of diseases 
characterized by [CONTACT_67984], blood, and other tissues by [CONTACT_67985].  It represents the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, 
with an estimated 11,930 new cases in the [LOCATION_002] each year.1  The median age at 
presentation is 65, with a male:female ratio of approximately 5:3.[ADDRESS_74104] induction chemotherapy in AML consists of the “7+3” regimen with 7 days of 
continuous infusion cytarabine and 3 days of daunorubicin or idarubicin.  This approach 
is followed by [CONTACT_67986] a hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) in those with high-risk disease.  Intensive treatment regimens lead to complete 
remission (CR) in 60-80% of younger patients with de novo AML.5  Unfortunately, for 
elderly patients (defined as those over age 60) CR rates are generally 40-50% with such 
therapy.6  The median overall survival for those not attaining a CR is less than one year, 
with patients often succumbing to fatal complications related to bone marrow aplasia and 
impaired hematopoietic recovery.7    
 
For those that do attain a CR, the majority will recur within three years of diagnosis.8  
The prognosis for those with relapsed or refractory AML remains poor.  Aside from 
patients with specific AML subtypes (core-binding factor positive AML and acute 
promyelocytic leukemia), those with relapsed or primary refractory AML are unlikely to 
be cured without an allogeneic stem cell transplant.  While select patients may move on 
to allogeneic stem cell transplant in first relapse, the majority will require reinduction 
chemotherapy prior to transplantation in order to attain disease control. In general, factors 
such as the duration of first remission, FLT3 mutational status, and the presence of high-
risk cytogenetics have borne out as major prognostic markers in determining who is 
likely to respond to salvage chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_74105] unsuccessfully received a 
prior salvage regimen are unlikely to experience a second complete remission (CR rates 
0-20%).10,11   
 
Commonly utilized salvage regimens include high dose cytarabine alone; fludarabine, 
cytarabine, and G-CSF (FLAG); mitoxantrone, cytarabine, and etoposide (MEC); 
cladribine, cytarabine, and G-CSF (CLAG); and, for those who attained a long disease 
remission, initial induction therapy may be used as a salvage regimen.12-15  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_67946], 2 year overall survival is still poor in this 
population (12-58%); thus novel treatment approaches are needed for remission 
induction.9 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 8 of 61   
In a single-center retrospective study of salvage chemotherapy in relapsed/refractory 
AML, the CLAG regimen showed a CR rate of 38% with an approximately 10% 30-day 
death rate.[ADDRESS_74106] or all of the major tumor 
suppressor proteins (TSP) and growth regulatory proteins (GRP) in order to perpetuate 
their phenotypes.[ADDRESS_74107] majority of TSP and GRP require nuclear localization in 
order to carry out their antineoplastic and regulatory activities and therefore nuclear 
export leads to their functional inactivation. Nuclear import and export is a tightly 
regulated process facilitated by [CONTACT_67987]. There are over 15 
nuclear import proteins, or importins, but only seven nuclear export proteins, or exportins 
(Exportins 1-7). The protein Exportin 1 (XPO1, also called CMR1) is known to be 
largely responsible for the export of major TSP and other growth modulators.  
Furthermore, XPO1 levels have been shown to be elevated in both solid and hematologic 
malignancies and higher levels generally correlate with poorer prognosis.18-[ADDRESS_74108] co-opted XPO1 to move TSP and GRP out of the nucleus, thereby 
[CONTACT_67988]-neoplastic functions.   
 
XPO1 inhibitors block the nuclear export of key TSP, thereby [CONTACT_67989], as nuclear import appears to proceed unimpeded. It has 
been shown that nuclear retention appears to prevent proteasome-mediated degradation 
(which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_67947]). Forced nuclear retention of TSP and GRP can 
counteract a number of oncogenic (and inflammatory) pathways that perpetuate the 
neoplastic phenotype (Table 1.1). Moreover, certain proteins, specifically survivin and 
p21CIP1 can be anti-apoptotic when localized to the cytoplasm and therefore forcing their 
nuclear retention with XPO1 inhibition can prevent their anti-apoptotic functions, and in 
the case of p21, expose its antitumor activities.24,[ADDRESS_74109] of XPO1 Inhibition  Reference

 Selinexor (KPT-330), a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINETM Compound 
 
Selinexor is an oral, first in class, slowly-reversible, potent and Selective Inhibitor of 
Nuclear Export / SINETM compound that specifically blocks the protein Exportin 1 
(XPO1), also known as chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1).  To date, other than 
XPO1, no targets of selinexor have been identified and XPO1 is overexpressed 2-4 fold 
in all cancers studies to date. 
 
Selinexor restores many of the TSP and GRPs to the nucleus where they can carry out 
their normal regulatory and anti-tumor functions. Selinexor has shown to be selectively 
cytotoxic for cells with genomic damage, i.e., for tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo. 
The nuclear export of eIF4E, a protein that binds to the mRNAs of many oncogenic and 
growth-promoting mediators, requires XPO1 for transport to cytoplasmic ribosomes.  
Selinexor blocks the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of eIF4E, preventing translation of 
the eIF4E-bound mRNAs on ribosomes, with a reduction in levels of the cognate 
oncogenic and growth-promoting proteins.   
 
All cell types exposed to SINETM in vitro undergo G1/S ± G2/M cell cycle arrest, 
followed by a ‘genomic fidelity’ review, and cells with damaged genomes are induced to 
undergo apoptosis. Normal cells, with an intact genome, remain in transient, reversible 
cell cycle arrest until the export block is relieved. Selinexor and other SINETM 
compounds are not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, they can restore the highly effective 
tumor suppressing pathways that lead to selective elimination of genetically damaged 
(i.e., neoplastic) cells. Hematopoietic tumors are particularly susceptible to induction of 
apoptosis by [CONTACT_67990]1 inhibition whereas normal hematopoietic cells and their functions are 
largely spared. 
 
 Preclinical Information 
 
AML cells overexpress the nuclear exporter, Exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) and 
higher XPO1 levels generally correlate with poor outcome.23  The novel Selective 
Inhibitor of Nuclear Transport / SINETM, selinexor, antagonizes XPO1 and shows 
potent cytotoxicity for AML and ALL cells in vitro, independent of genotype.  
 
Selinexor shows potent antiproliferative effect and induced apoptosis, cell cycle 
arrest and myeloid differentiation in AML cell lines and patient blasts, including 
those from patients with NPM1  and FLT3-ITD mutations.26  
 
Mechanistic studies show that SINETM compounds induce nuclear localization and 
activation of multiple TSPs, leading to rapid apoptosis of AML cells.  In addition, 
a strong down-regulation of the oncogenes FLT3 and c-KIT were observed after 
SINETM treatment in both FLT3-ITD and wild-type cell lines.26 Selinexor 
treatment also restored the localization of cytoplasmic mutant NPM1 into the 
nucleus.  
 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 10 of 61  In murine AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) models, selinexor 
showed potent antileukemic activity without toxicity to normal hematopoietic 
cells.26,27  
 
In vitro experiments with continuous (~72 hour) exposure to selinexor 
demonstrated potent proapoptotic activity across a broad panel of tumor-derived 
cell lines and patient samples in culture including multiply-resistant cancers, with 
the majority of inhibitory concentrations, 50% (IC 50s) for cytotoxicity < [ADDRESS_74110] hematologic tumor lines having IC 50s of 20-400 nM for selinexor. 
Moreover, selinexor demonstrated cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma (MM) and 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in the absence or presence of bone 
marrow stroma cells (BMSC). In contrast, normal cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_67948] (or 
remained in) cell cycle arrest but were resistant to apoptosis-induction; 
cytotoxicity IC 50s were typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] > [ADDRESS_74111] on normal (nonmalignant) lymphocytes or other nontransformed cells, 
which correlated with the low incidence in animals of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_67949]-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_67950], alopecia, 
mucositis and other gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. 
 
Selinexor, as well as other SINE™ compounds, was administered in efficacy 
studies to mice and dogs and in toxicology studies to rats and monkeys.  The 
dosing regimen was every other day x 3 each week (QoD x3/wk); anti-tumor 
activity has also been shown with twice weekly (BIW, Days 1 and 4 of each 
week) dosing.  Efficacy was demonstrated at doses of 5-20 mg/kg (15-60 mg/m2) 
in mouse models of myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and T-cell acute 
lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) xenografts.  
  
Selinexor demonstrated efficacy in numerous preclinical models of hematological 
and solid tumors (Azmi et al., 2013a; Azmi et al., 2013b; Cheng et al., 2014; 
Etchin et al., 2013a; Fragomeni et al., 2013; Tai et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2013).  
Selinexor treatment resulted in significant survival advantages in models of MM, 
NHL, CLL, AML and ALL.  Selinexor also demonstrated robust single agent 
efficacy in solid tumor xenografts including: prostate, breast, melanoma, colon, 
ovarian, neuroblastoma and several sarcomas.  In addition, marked synergy was 
observed when selinexor was used with a variety of chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_67951], taxanes, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, 
dexamethasone, cytarabine, proteasome inhibitors and various tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs).  
 
Preclinical parameters were assessed in three species: mouse (CD1), rat (Sprague-
Dawley), and monkey (cynomolgus). While pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were 
limited to male animals for all three species, toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations were 
conducted in both sexes for rats and monkeys as part of the selinexor toxicology 
studies, and no consistent sex-related differences were observed in either species. 
No accumulation was observed in any of the multi-dose toxicology studies with 
an every other day dosing regimen for selinexor. Overall, systemic exposure was 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 11 of 61  generally dose-proportional in all TK studies that involved multiple dose levels. 
Higher maximum concentration (C max) and earlier time to maximum 
concentration (T max) values were observed in monkeys that were fasted versus fed 
prior to dosing. Systemic exposure (area under the curve from first to last plasma 
measurement, AUC last) to selinexor achieved with gelatin capsules was 
comparable to that achieved with oral suspension dosing, with lower C max and 
later T max values observed with capsules, and was not affected by [CONTACT_67991]. Oral bioavailability (F%) of selinexor was remarkably 
consistent among the three species, with average values of 66.5%, 61.2%, and 
67.5% in mice, rats, and monkeys, respectively. See the Selinexor Investigator’s 
Brochure for more information. 
 
Nonclinical toxicology studies indicated that the major side effects (dose limiting 
toxicities, DLTs) across all species are reduced appetite with anorexia-induced 
weight loss partially consistent with satiety induction.  High calorie foods and 
glucocorticoids can mitigate weight loss in animals taking SINETM compounds.  
 
 Clinical Experience 
 
Study KCP-330-001 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate 
the safety and tolerability of oral selinexor and determine the recommended phase 
II dose in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. Arm 1 of this study 
includes patients with “chronic” hematological malignancies including multiple 
myeloma (MM), Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia (WM), Non-Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 2 patients were 
enrolled in cohort 1 with dose escalation of 100% increase from cohort [ADDRESS_74112] 3 patients with dose escalation of 100% increase from 
cohort [ADDRESS_74113] 3+3 design was used with 
dose escalation increase of 30-40% from the previous cohort.   
 
Arm 2 includes patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) except M3 subtype. 
Due to the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_67952], Arm 2 began dosing at 16.8 mg/m2 
after dose limiting toxicity (DLT) clearance of 12 mg/m2 in cohort 3 and after 
dosing at 16.8 mg/m2 was employed in cohort [ADDRESS_74114] 3+3 design was used with a dose 
escalation increase of 30-40% from previous cohort. Arm 3 includes up to 12 
patients with relapsed/refractory Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) or 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) treated at a dose of 30 mg/m2 twice weekly. 
 
As of [ADDRESS_74115] been enrolled in this study, with 
65 patients on Arm 2 (AML) enrolled at ten clinical centers in the [LOCATION_003], Canada, 
and Denmark, and treated at doses ranging from 3 mg/m2 to 70 mg/m2 on 
Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 (10 or 8 doses/cycle).  As of 10 June 2014, 6 AML 
patients remain on study treatment. 
   
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 12 of 61  Overview of Clinical Efficacy in AML.  In Arm 2 (AML), 32 of the 48 patients 
(67%) evaluated as of [ADDRESS_74116] experienced a complete remission (CR), 
complete remission without platelet recovery (CRi), partial response, morphologic 
leukemia free state or stable disease (SD).  Seven patients experienced a CR or 
CR(i).  Five of these patients experienced a CR, while the other two patients 
experienced a CR(i).  As of 10 June 2014, 1 patient has experienced a partial 
response, two of these patients showed a morphologic leukemia free state, 22 
patients are showing SD.  Seventeen patients were non evaluable as of 10 June 
2014. Responses for the 48 patients who had been evaluated as of 10 June 2014, 
each of whom received a dose between 16.8 mg/m2 to 70 mg/m2 per cycle, are 
shown in Table 1.2.

Overview of Clinical Safety in AML.  Gastrointestinal adverse events and fatigue 
are the most common types of AEs seen in Arm 2 (AML) patients.  As of [ADDRESS_74117] of nausea in 27 
patients (42%), anorexia in 26 patients (42%), diarrhea in 23 patients (35%), 
vomiting in 17 patients (26%), and weight loss in 11 patients (17%). The 
gastrointestinal events are primarily Grade [ADDRESS_74118] supportive care.  Fatigue was observed in 31 patients in 
this arm (48%) as of 2 May 2014, including Grade 3 fatigue in five patients (8%) 
and Grade 1 or Grade 2 fatigue in 26 patients (40%).  Karyopharm observed 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia in four patients (6%) in this arm as of 2 May 2014.  
Karyopharm expects that the thrombocytopenia is primarily a result of patients 
entering this arm with marked bone marrow suppression due to both disease and 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Karyopharm also observed Grade 4 neutropenia in four patients 
(6%) and Grade 4 anemia in one patient (>2%). 
 
It is anticipated that fewer and more mild gastrointestinal events and reduced 
fatigue will be observed in the future as a result of the initiation of supportive care 
and medications prior to beginning selinexor therapy. 
 
 Potential Risks 
 
Selinexor is currently in clinical development and has not been approved by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA) for commercial use. Human experience 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 13 of 61  with Selinexor is currently limited and the entire safety profile is not known at 
this time. Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the patients participating 
in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
close monitoring. Toxicity grading will be performed in accordance with National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) 4.03. If more than one different type of toxicity occurs concurrently, 
the most severe grade will determine the modification. 
 
If toxicities are encountered, adjustments will be made to the study treatment as 
detailed in the sections below. All adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) will be recorded during the trial and for up to [ADDRESS_74119]. 
 
Please refer the Investigator’s Brochure for the most up-to-date information. 
 
Reproductive risks 
Patients should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_67992]. Women should not breastfeed a 
baby [CONTACT_56035]. It is important patients understand the need to use birth 
control while on this study. It is not anticipated that female patients enrolling in 
this study will be able to conceive. However, in the rare event that this is possible, 
female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of 
contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male 
patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active 
with a female of child-bearing potential. Acceptable methods of contraception are 
condoms with contraceptive foam, oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, 
contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, or a 
sexual partner who is surgically sterilized or post-menopausal. For both male and 
female patients, effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the 
study and for three months following the last dose. 
 
 Study Rationale 
 
Selinexor has shown single-agent activity in a current phase I study enrolling patients 
with relapsed/refractory AML with durable complete remissions (CR), complete 
remissions with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), partial remissions (PR), and 
stable disease (SD) observed.  Furthermore, common toxicities included nausea, fatigue, 
and anorexia and were manageable with supportive care agents.  Additionally, CLAG 
chemotherapy has proven activity in relapsed and refractory AML, and has been shown 
to be a relatively well tolerated regimen without significant non-hematologic 
toxicity.16,28,29 Given the established role of CLAG chemotherapy, the single agent 
activity of selinexor, and their non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], we propose a phase I/II open 
label study of selinexor in combination with CLAG for the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory AML.     
 
Protocol Version 08/22/[ADDRESS_74120] study in patients with 
advanced sarcomas.  Ten doses per 4-week cycle of selinexor were initially evaluated in 
studies. With this dosing regimen, the DLTs were anorexia, nausea, and fatigue at 40 
mg/m2 in KCP-330-002 and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 30 mg/m2 using 
this regimen. However, pharmacodynamics analyses suggest that at doses > 12 mg/m2, 
selinexor inhibits XPO1 activity for > 48 hrs. Therefore, reduced intensity dosing at twice 
weekly was evaluated and subsequently showed improved tolerability with observed anti-
cancer activity.  
 
Selinexor therapy will be dosed based on a fixed oral dose of 60mg of selinexor, roughly 
equivalent to 35 mg/m2.  To ensure that no patient will be dosed at a dose >70mg/m2, the 
study will be limited to patients with a body surface area (BSA) (calculated by [CONTACT_67993]) >1.43 m2. This dosing regimen is supported by [CONTACT_67994] 
(Figure 1.1) and summarized below.  
The 5th and 95th percentile for BSA values encountered to date in Phase 1 trials KCP-
330-001 and KCP-330-002 are 1.5 and 2.3 m2, respectively (N=331).  For this range, flat 
doses of 60 mg and 100 mg of selinexor translate to BSA normalized dose ranges of 27-
40 mg/m2 and 43-70 mg/m2, respectively.  To evaluate PK for flat doses of 60 mg and 
100 mg of selinexor, Cmax and AUC(0-∞) values were compared for the equivalent, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_67953]-normalized dose ranges (Figure 1.1).  Both Cmax and AUC(0-∞) were 
found to be significantly different (p<0.0001) for 60 mg and 100 mg of selinexor.  
Therefore, we conclude that 60 mg and 100 mg selinexor doses are expected to provide 
significantly different PK results.

induces nuclear accumulation of some targets (p53, NPM, Fox03a, IκB, others) in AML 
blasts.

is also allowed per institutional guidelines.  
 
Co-administration of corticosteroids and corticosteroid-containing eye drops (or 
equivalent) is recommended for patients receiving cytarabine containing regimens. Eye 
drops should continue for at least [ADDRESS_74128] dose of cytarabine. 
  
Antiemetic prophylaxis given per institutional guidelines is recommended.  
 
Treatment for fatigue and anorexia is recommended for patients receiving selinexor (see 
guideline Section 5.7) 
 
 
 Ophthalmic Assessment 
 
A complete ophthalmologic assessment will be conducted on all patients by [CONTACT_67997]. The full ophthalmic assessment includes: 
 Prior to dilation : best corrected visual acuity and slit lamp examination 
including tonometry 
 Following dilation : Fundoscopy and a slit lamp examination to document 
lens clarity.  If a cataract/lens opacity is seen during the examination, the 
cataract/lens opacity will be graded according to a Grade 1-4 system 
(Error! Reference source not found. ). 
A complete ophthalmic assessment should be performed as clinically indicated during the 
course of the study to monitor ophthalmic adverse events.  
 
 
 
 
   
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 21 of 61  
 Overall Treatment Plan 
 
Patients treated with selinexor on Schedule A will receive doses on Days 1, 5, 10 and 12 
of a 28 day cycle.  Patients treated on Schedule B will be administered selinexor doses on 
Days 1, 5, 10, 12, 17 and 19 of a 28 day cycle.  For patients being treated with selinexor 
maintenance therapy, selinexor will be administered on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28 day 
cycle.  For doses on non-clinic days, patients will be provided doses to take home, one 
dose per container. Compliance to study medication will be recorded by [CONTACT_67998].  
 
 Phase I Dosing 
 
For the Phase I portion, patients will be treated with the following: 
 
Selinexor (S): Oral doses of 60 mg will be administered   
Cladribine (CL): 5 mg/m2/day IV once daily on Days 4-8 
G-CSF (G): 300 mcg SC once daily on Days 3-8 
Cytarabine (A): 2000 mg/m2/day IV once daily on Days 4-8  
Dosing of cladribine and cytarabine should be performed according to actual body 
weight ± 5% to allow for rounding. Patients will be dosed based on body surface 
area (BSA) (calculated by [CONTACT_67999]).  Selinexor is dosed on a flat-dosing 
basis.  To ensure that no patient will receive a dose of selinexor >70mg/m2, body 
surface area (BSA) calculated by [CONTACT_67996] >1.43 m2

Protocol Version 08/22/[ADDRESS_74129] intense schedule in which ≤3 DLTs are 
observed in 12 patients treated using that schedule.  If no DLTs are experienced in 
Schedule B, then Schedule B will be considered the Phase II dose.  The phase I 
safety analysis together with the conclusion on the recommended dose for Phase 
II will be distributed to all participating investigators prior to starting the Phase II 
enrollment. 
 
 Definition of  MTD, DLT, Dose Escalation Criteria, and Patient Evaluability 
 
 Dose Escalation Criteria 
 
The initial cohort of 6 patients will be dosed according to Schedule A.  If no dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) are experienced with the initial cohort of [ADDRESS_74130] 5 doses of selinexor (either on Schedule A or 
B) and all doses of CLAG for reasons other than an adverse event at least possibly 
related to the study treatment will not be considered to have adequate date to 
support dose schedule escalation and may be replaced at the same dose schedule 
in the phase I portion of the study. 
 
 
The decision rule is: 
 Schedule A  
Number of patients treated  6 
Intensify schedule  if # of DLT = 0 in 6 
Repeat schedule if # of DLT = 1 in 6 
Stop if # of DLT = 2 in 6 
 Schedule A and B  
Accept schedule if # DLTs ≤  3 in 12 
De-intensify schedule  if # of DLT = 4 in 12 *†  
Stop if # of DLT = 5 in 12 
 
* There is no de-escalation below the starting schedule. If 1 DLT is observed in 
the initial cohort with Schedule A dosing and the Schedule A dosing is repeated in 
the second cohort, the study will be stopped if 3 DLTs are observed in the second 
cohort, a total of 4 DLTs in cohorts 1 and 2 together. 
 
† If the schedule is intensified after Schedule A dosing and de-intensification is 
indicated after schedule B dosing, 6 additional patients will be treated using the 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 23 of 61  schedule A. Schedule A dosing will be accepted if no more than 2 DLTs are 
observed in a maximum of 18 patients treated using that schedule. 
 
 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) 
 
DLTs will be defined as any of the following that occur during treatment on 
Schedule A or B during Cycle 1 that are attributed as possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to selinexor treatment: 
 Grade ≥ 3 nausea/vomiting, dehydration or diarrhea while taking optimal 
supportive medications 
 Grade ≥ 3 fatigue lasting for ≥5 days while taking optimal supportive care 
and with correction of dehydration, anorexia, anemia, endocrine, or 
electrolyte abnormalities (See Section 5.5). 
 Any other Grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity except electrolyte 
abnormalities correctable with supportive therapy 
 Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_74131] or ALT elevation lasting longer than 7 days OR Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_74132] or ALT elevation in the setting of bilirubin elevation > 2x ULN (>2X 
baseline for patients with Gilbert’s syndrome) 
 
Patients who have failed to attain hematopoietic recovery by 42 days after the 
start of therapy should undergo a bone marrow biopsy/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_67956].  Prolonged myelosuppression, i.e. marrow cellularity < 5% on Day 42 
or later (6 weeks) from start of cycle 1 without any evidence of leukemia, will 
also be considered in defining DLT. 
 
The following will specifically not be considered DLTs: 
 Grade 4 neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3] 
lasting ≥7 days; 
 Febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1000/mm3 with a single temperature ≥ 
38.3ºC or sustained temperature of >38°C for over 1 hour) or 
 Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia with or without associated bleeding 
 
Infection and infection related complications will not be considered DLTs.  
 
Persistent grade 3 or higher neutropenia ≥ 42 days after the start of therapy in the 
absence of leukemia will be considered a DLT.  
 
In rare instances, an event may fall within the definition of a DLT as defined 
above but the event may be considered not a DLT (ie: not clinically 
meaningful/significant). If this occurs, a meeting with all investigators, PI, and 
possibly the drug manufacturer will take place to thoroughly review the event and 
supporting data and the reasons for not considering the event a DLT will be 
clearly documented with supporting rationale. In addition other events may occur 
which do not meet the definition of a DLT but are concerning to the investigators 
and sponsor and may be then considered to be DLTs. 
Protocol Version 08/22/[ADDRESS_74133] receiving study treatment until a 30-day follow up after 
the conclusion of treatment or death. 
 
All patients are evaluable for disease response unless they discontinue treatment 
due to treatment related adverse events(s) and have not had any disease 
assessment. 
 
A patient is evaluable for DLT assessment only during Cycle 1 treatment on 
schedule A and/or B.  
 
 Selinexor Maintenance Therapy for Patients who Achieve CR/CRi 
 
In both the phase I and II portions of the study, patients are candidates for selinexor 
maintenance therapy if they have achieved a CR or CRi based on post-treatment bone 
marrow assessment at the time of hematopoietic recovery and are either (1) transplant 
ineligible (defined in Section 5.6) or (2) do not have a stem cell transplant donor 
available. Prior to initiating maintenance therapy with selinexor, a bone marrow biopsy 
must confirm the presence of the CR or CRi. Maintenance therapy should be initiated no 
sooner than [ADDRESS_74134] 
dose of selinexor therapy.  Maintenance therapy consists of 60mg selinexor on Days 1, 8, 
15, and 22 of a 28 day cycle, continuously until disease relapse, unacceptable toxicity, 
death, or the institution of additional antileukemic therapy including stem cell 
transplantation or donor leukocyte infusion.  
 
  
 Assessment of Ineligibility for Stem Cell Transplant 
 
The investigator will perform a comprehensive review of patient characteristics (e.g. age, 
performance score, organ dysfunctions, co-morbidities) to assess a patient's eligibility for 
allogeneic stem cell transplant. A detailed description of the reasons for considering a 
patient ineligible for stem cell transplant will be documented in the source records. If co-
morbidities and organ dysfunctions are relevant for considering the patient ineligible for 
stem cell transplant, the documentation will include the details on organ system, type and 
stage/grade of dysfunction (e.g. NYHA for heart failure, Child-Pugh for liver cirrhosis, 
etc.).

(prn). 
 
 Supportive Care Recommendations for Selinexor-Related Adverse 
Events 
 
Supportive measures for optimal medical care should be provided during 
participation in this clinical trial.  Based on clinical observations in over 450 adult 
patients treated with selinexor as of 01 October 2014, the main side effects are 
primarily related to anorexia with poor caloric and fluid intake, fatigue, and 
nausea.  Thrombocytopenia also occurs, although it is rarely associated with 
bleeding.   
 
Besides the required dexamethasone and 5-HT3, supportive care including anti-
nausea / anti-emetic therapy, acid suppression (proton pump inhibitors and/or H2-
blockers) and other treatments may be administered as described below: 
1. Glucocorticoids: In addition to the required dexamethasone supportive care, 
an additional 4-8 mg dexamethasone (or equivalent glucocorticoid) may be 
given on the days after selinexor dosing; a maximum of 40 mg dexamethasone 
or equivalent may be given per week. 
2. Appetite stimulants: megestrol acetate at a dose of 80-400 mg daily. 
3. Centrally acting agents: per National Comprehensive Cancer Network® 
[NCCN] Clinical Practice Guidelines® for anorexia/cachexia and antiemesis 
[palliative care]) see Appendix 2 (anorexia/cachexia) and Appendix 3 
(antiemesis), respectively. 
4. NK1R antagonist:  aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_67957]. 
Additional information on supportive care and dose modifications for specific 
adverse events can be found in Supportive Care and Dose Adjustment Guidelines 
for Non-Hematologic Selinexor-Related Toxicities below 
 
 Concomitant Medication and Treatment 
 
Concomitant medication is defined as any prescription or over-the-counter 
preparation, including vitamins and supplements. Patients may continue their 
baseline medication(s). Any diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure 
performed during the study period should be recorded, including the dates, 
description of the procedure(s) and any clinical findings.  
 
Protocol Version 08/22/[ADDRESS_74136] be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_1689].  
  
Alcohol 
Ethanol should be avoided on selinexor dosing days as it may compete for 
glutathione (GSH)-mediated metabolism. 
 
Medications 
Although not prohibited, acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing products 
must not exceed a total daily dose of 1 gram on days of selinexor dosing. 
 
Glutathione (GSH)-, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-, or N-acetylcysteine (NAC)-
containing products should not be taken during participation in this study as these 
products may enhance the metabolism of selinexor.  Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_74137] be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow-up. 
 
 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 27 of 61  protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation 
documented in the case report forms. 
 
Patients will be considered to have completed treatment upon achieving CR, 
documentation of persistent leukemia, or upon administration of additional antileukemic 
therapy including stem cell transplantation or donor leukocyte infusion.   As documented 
in Section 5.6, patients who achieve a CR or CRi based on post-treatment bone marrow 
assessment at the time of hematopoietic recovery and are either transplant ineligible or do 
not have a stem cell transplant donor available are candidates for selinexor maintenance 
therapy. Maintenance therapy continues until disease relapse, unacceptable toxicity, 
death, or the institution of additional antileukemic therapy including stem cell 
transplantation or donor leukocyte infusion. 
 
 Removal from Study 
 
Patients may be removed from the study for any of the following reasons: 
 Death 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
 Suspected pregnancy 
 Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Patient withdraws consent 
 Investigator removes the patient from study 
 The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study 
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar. 
 
 Patient Replacement

Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 28 of 61   
 
 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Toxicity will be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03; the therapy modifications described below 
are applied according to this severity grading. 
If more than one different type of toxicity occurs concurrently, the most severe grade will 
determine the modification. 
Each dose modification or treatment delay has to be documented, including the respective 
reason. 
Based on observations from the ongoing Phase 1 studies in patients with advanced hematological 
and solid tumors, selinexor shows a reasonably wide therapeutic range, with activities from ~10 
mg/m2 to ≥ 60 mg/m2.  Therefore, in order to optimize specific anti-tumor activity and the 
patient’s tolerability, we will allow for dose and/or schedule modifications as described below. 
Patients should also be treated aggressively with supportive care to reduce toxicities. 
Dose modification pertains to selinexor maintenance therapy only. No dose modification will be 
permitted in cycle 1 for selinexor or CLAG chemotherapy.

regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
 
 
 Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_68005] [INVESTIGATOR_67961]: 
 
Not related The lack of a temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment makes a causal relationship not reasonably possible, or 
other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation.  
Related The temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment 
makes a definitive relationship, and the event is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_37390], therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions. 
 
 Other Safety Reporting 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_67962], misuse, medication 
errors, overdose, and occupational exposure to Karyopharm on an SAE Report Form,

‘serious’ is any inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37350] a minimum of an overnight stay 
in a health care facility. An emergency room visit is not considered a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67964]. 
 
Progression of the malignancy (including fatal outcomes) should not be reported as an 
SAE during the study or within the safety reporting period. Sudden and unexplained 
death should be reported as an SAE. If there is any uncertainty about a finding being due 
solely to progression of malignancy, the finding should be reported as an AE or SAE, as 
appropriate. 
 
Pregnancies must be reported to Karyopharm Pharmacovigilance, regardless of whether 
the patient withdraws from the study or the study is completed, for 3 months after the 
patient receives his/her last dose of study treatment. Patients should be instructed to 
inform the investigator regarding any pregnancies.

 Cytosine Arabinoside (AraC, Cytarabine)  
 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 40 of 61  
 Cytosine Arabinoside Description 
 
Chemical Name:  4-amino-1-S-D-arabino-furanosyl-2(1H)-primidinone 
Molecular formula:  C9H13N3O5 
Molecular weight:  243.217g/mol 
Pharmacologic class:  Antimetabolite 
 
 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Cytarabine is metabolized to its active form, cytarabine triphosphate (AraCTP) by 
[CONTACT_68008]. AraCTP serves as an inhibitor of DNA 
polymerase. AraC also is incorporated into cellular RNA and DNA. It exhibits 
cell phase specificity, and is active against cells in the S-phase and may also block 
cells from progressing to S phase from G1.  
 
 
 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
 
After intravenous administration, the disappearance of Cytarabine from plasma is 
biphasic. There is an initial distributive phase with a half-life of approximately [ADDRESS_74154] 
be supplied by [CONTACT_6773]. 
 
 Dosage Form and Preparation 
 
Cytarabine is supplied as a sterile powder in 100 mg, 500 mg, 1 gram, and 2 gram 
vials for injection. Cytarabine should be reconstituted with sterile water for 
injection. 
 
 Storage and Stability 
 
Sterile powder should be stored at room temperature 15° -30°C (59°- 86°F). 
Solutions reconstituted with sterile water without preservative should be used 
immediately; solutions reconstituted with Bacteriostatic of Water are stable up to 
48 hours at room temperature 15° -30°C (59°- 86°F). Solutions with a slight haze 
should be discarded. 
 
 Administration 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 41 of 61   
Cytarabine 2000 mg/m2/day intravenous infusion once daily over 4 hours on Days 
4-8. Dosing should be performed according to actual body weight ± 5% to allow 
for rounding. 
 
 Cladribine (Leustatin) 
 
 Cladribine Description 
 
Chemical Name:  5-(6-amino-2-chloro-purin-9-yl)-2-(hydroxymethyl)oxolan-3-ol 
Molecular formula:  C10H12CIN5O3 
Molecular weight:  285.687 g/mol 
Pharmacologic class:  Antimetabolite 
 
 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Cladribine is phosphorylated by [CONTACT_68009] 2-chloro-2΄-deoxy-β-D-
adenosine monophosphate (2-CdAMP). 2-CdAMP then accumulates 
intracellularly and is subsequently converted into the active triphosphate 
deoxynucleotide, 2-chloro-2΄-deoxy-β-D-adenosine triphosphate (2-CdATP). 
Cells containing high concentrations of deoxynucleotides are unable to properly 
repair single-strand DNA breaks. The broken ends of DNA activate the enzyme 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase resulting in NAD and ATP depletion and 
disruption of cellular metabolism. There is also evidence that 2-CdATP is 
incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, resulting in impairment of DNA 
synthesis.  
 
 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism 
 
Cladribine plasma concentration after intravenous infusion has been shown to 
decline multi-exponentially and displays an average half-life of 6.7 +/- 2.5 hours. 
The volume of distribution is approximately 9L/kg.  Cladribine penetrates into 
CSF, with concentrations reaching approximately 25% of plasma levels.  
Cladribine is approximately 20% bound to plasma proteins.  Little is known 
regarding the metabolism in human subjects.  Limited data has shown that 18% of 
the administered dose is excreted in the urine of patients treated with a 5-day 
continuous intravenous infusion. Treatment of patients with renal and hepatic 
impairment has not been extensively investigated in human subjects.  
 
 Supplier 
 
Cladribine is commercially available and not provided as a study drug and must 
be supplied by [CONTACT_6773]. 
 
 Dosage Form and Preparation 
 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 42 of 61  Cladribine is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, isotonic solution containing 
10 mg (1 mg/mL) of cladribine as 10 mL filled into a single-use clear flint glass 
20 mL vial. Cladribine is supplied in 10 mL (1 mg/mL) single-use vials available 
in a treatment set (case) of seven vials. Cladribine must be diluted with the 
designated diluent prior to administration. Since the drug product does not contain 
any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agent, aseptic technique and 
proper environmental precautions must be observed in preparation of the 
intravenous infusion. The use of 5% dextrose as a diluent is not recommended 
because of increased degradation of cladribine. 
 
 
 Storage and Stability 
 
When stored in refrigerated conditions between 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) protected 
from light, unopened vials of cladribine injection are stable until the expi[INVESTIGATOR_67966]. Freezing does not adversely affect the solution. If 
freezing occurs, thaw naturally to room temperature. DO NOT heat or microwave. 
Once thawed, the vial of cladribine injection is stable until expi[INVESTIGATOR_67967]. 
DO NOT refreeze. Once diluted, solutions containing cladribine injection should 
be administered promptly or stored in the refrigerator (2° to 8°C) for no more than 
8 hours prior to administration. 
 
 Administration 
 
Cladribine 5 mg/m2/day intravenous infusion once daily over 2 hours on Days 4-

 Filgrastim Description 
 
Molecular formula:  C845H1339N223O243S9 
Molecular weight:  18,800 daltons 
Pharmacologic class:  Leukocyte growth factor 
 
 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Colony stimulating factors are endogenous lineage specific glycoproteins that acts 
on hematopoietic cells through binding to a specific cell surface receptor and lead 
to proliferation‚ differentiation‚ and some end-cell functional activation.   
 
G-CSF helps to regulate the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow, and 
also effects the differentiation and proliferation of neutrophil progenitor cells.  G-
CSF also plays a role in regulating some end-cell functional activation including

 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
 
This is a phase I/II, open label study of selinexor given in combination with CLAG in 
patients with relapsed/refractory AML.  
 
The phase I portion will use a Bayesian optimal interval design to identify a schedule 
with grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity that does not exceed 20%. Six patients will be 
enrolled in each of two cohorts and an additional cohort of [ADDRESS_74169] one grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity, given a true rate of 
20%, is .73 with 6 patients, .93 with 12 patients and .98 with 18 patients. The decision 
rule is: 
 
 Schedule A 
Number of patients treated  6 
Intensify schedule  if # of DLT = 0 in 6 
Repeat schedule  if # of DLT = 1 in 6 
Stop if # of DLT = 2 in 6 
 Schedule A and B 
Accept schedule if # DLTs ≤  3 in 12 
De-intensify schedule if # of DLT = 4 in 12 *† 
Stop if # of DLT = 5 in 12 
 
* There is no de-escalation below the starting schedule. If 1 DLT is observed in the initial 
cohort with Schedule A dosing and the Schedule A dosing is repeated in the second 
cohort, the study will be stopped if 3 DLTs are observed in the second cohort, a total of 4 
DLTs in cohorts 1 and 2 together. 
Protocol Version 08/22/17   Page 50 of 61   
† If the schedule is intensified after Schedule A dosing and de-intensification is indicated 
after Schedule B dosing, 6 additional patients will be treated using the Schedule A. 
Schedule A dosing will be accepted if no more than 2 DLTs are observed in a maximum 
of 18 patients treated using that schedule. 
 
The phase II portion was designed to compare the primary endpoint of complete 
remission rate (CR + CRi) with an historical 33%.  Patients in the phase I portion of the 
study, treated at the MTD will count towards the phase II accrual goal for evaluation of 
the primary endpoint.  With a sample size of 40, it will have power of 0.[ADDRESS_74170] for difference of a proportion from a 
historical value if the study observes a CR/CRi rate ≥ 0.55.  A continuous toxicity 
monitoring rule based on 40 patients will be employed whereby [CONTACT_68012] 5% and the maximum allowable rate is 20%.  The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_67973] a maximum of 6 cases of excess toxicity in 40 patients (12.5%), 
and it has at least a 0.88 probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_67974] 20%. The study would 
be suspended for review if it observed [ADDRESS_74171] 32 patients, or if the 6th case is 
observed before the 40th patient has completed the study.    
 
Phase I data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_4676], type and grade of toxicity. In the phase II 
portion descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline patient characteristics 
and adverse events by [CONTACT_4676], type and severity.  Complete remission rate and complete 
cytogenetic remission rate will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals, as will the 
proportion of patients able to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Comparisons 
with historical rates may be made; if so, one sample tests for difference of proportion will 
be used. Kaplan Meier estimates will be used to describe the median time to hematologic 
recovery (neutrophils and platelets), duration of remission, event-free survival, relapse-
free survival and overall survival using 95% confidence intervals. The Cox proportional 
hazard model and logistic regression model will be used to evaluate the association of 
clinical and laboratory characteristics to survival and response respectively.  We will use 
a P <= 0.05 threshold for significance.  Drug-related AEs will be recorded and followed 
to the end of the study or until resolution.  All AEs will be classified using the 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.[ADDRESS_74172] 
percentage, annexin V/7AAD, and cell cycle status, XPO1 expression, nuclear 
accumulation of targets such as p53, NPM, Fox03a, IκB in AML blasts, and selinexor 
concentration. Potential covariates include, but are not limited to: age, body weight, 
gender, disease state, baseline hepatic or renal function, and concomitant medications.     
 
We anticipate completion of the study in 18-24 months.

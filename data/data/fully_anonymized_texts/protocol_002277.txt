CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 6 of 21 1. Introduction  
Sponsor  has developed the MAKO 7 d evice  to be used through the working channel of a hysteroscope  
for cell collection from the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916] . Hysteroscopy allows the physician to readily locate and 
evaluate the tubal ostium. Once the ostium is located, the MAKO 7 device will be placed through t he 
working channel of the hysteroscope and subsequently deployed through the length of the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_84486]. The MAKO 7 device is cleared as a hysteroscope accessory, placed through the working channel 
of a hysteroscope to obtain samples from the fallopi[CONTACT_1629] t ube for cytological evaluation. This study will 
include evaluation of those  samples , to determine if they are adequate to  enable determination and/or 
differentiation of normal vs.  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_249633]. malignant cells.  
This study will be conducted using a n Institutional  Review Board (IRB) approved  protocol at multiple 
centers. The Sponsor of this clinical study has the overall responsibility for the conduct of the study, 
including assurance that the study will be performed according to the clinical protocol, Title 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 812 and other relevant Federal Dru g Administration ( FDA) regulations , the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)  Guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice s (GCP).  
2. Background  
Cytologic  evaluation of cells collected from the female genital tract has yielded clinically useful 
information since the 1920s. Evaluation of cells for atypi[INVESTIGATOR_868672], in fact, been 
used effectively to identify individuals who  may be at increased risk for malignancy. It could prove 
useful to develop a system/device that could atraumatically, and minimally invasively, collect cells from 
the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868673] . 
In [ADDRESS_1212444] been challeng ing. 
The MAKO 7 was evaluated in 40 subjects (80 fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134]) who were already scheduled to undergo 
a laparoscopic tubal ligation.  Study endpoints included 1) ability of the device to navigate the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_692055], 2) ability of the device to collect a sample adequate for cytological evaluation, and 3) adverse 
events.  Access was achieved in 71/80 (89%) fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134].  The remaining [ADDRESS_1212445] pre -existing tubal occlusion, as determined by [CONTACT_868693] (in two of the tubes 
not initially accessed, a second access and navigation was successful after incidental clearing of tubal 
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN 0276  Rev 06       Page 7 of 21 blockage after methylene blue dye injection) .  The study pathologist determined that 70/71 (99%) o f 
the samples were adequate for cytological evaluation.   There were no device -related adverse events 
reported.  
3. Study Indications for Use  
The MAKO 7  is a hysteroscope accessory, placed t hrough the working channel of a hysteroscope to 
obtain sam ples from the fallopi [INVESTIGATOR_868674]/or differentiation of normal versus atypi[INVESTIGATOR_868664] . 
4. MAKO 7 Device Description  
As shown in Figure 1, the device is comprised of a catheter and a handle. The catheter includes a 
balloon , a shaft  (which is made up of a stainless steel tube and a Nylon tube ), a sheath , and a sheath 
knob. The handle includes a drive wheel and a luer in the handle body. The luer attaches to a 
commercially available inflation device via a commercially available 3-way stopcock.  
Figure 1: MAKO [ADDRESS_1212446] wheel, which causes a push wire inside the device to  advance. This causes  the balloon to evert 
linearly (gradually unfold from the inside out ).  
This balloon  that has been everted during the preparation step  is advanced into the proximal end of 
the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916]. Further eversion ( extension ) of the balloon  into the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868675] . The n the  balloon is deflated by [CONTACT_868694] . Because the balloon fills the potential space  of the 
fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], the balloon  surface makes contact [CONTACT_868695][INVESTIGATOR_84486]. This surface area contact [CONTACT_868696] s cell collection   
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN [ADDRESS_1212447] , cells can be removed 
from the balloon by [CONTACT_868697][INVESTIGATOR_868676] a cytopreservative and stirring in order to agitate the cells. 
Alternatively, both balloon and sheath can be cut off and placed into a cytopreservative.  
Please see the MAKO 7 device Instruction for Use (IFU) docum ent for more details.  
5. Study Scope and Duration  
We expect the study to begin in August of [ADDRESS_1212448] specimens  
from the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868677]/or 
differentiation of normal versus atypi[INVESTIGATOR_868664] .  
7. Study Design  
The study is a prospective, multi -center, observational study. Study su bjects will be recruited from a 
population of women who are already scheduled to undergo  salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy. Subjects will be 
recruited until at least [ADDRESS_1212449]  
classification system. Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868678] .  
Any baseline testing, pathology evaluations,  and all other clinical care will be in accordance with each 
participating institution’s standard of care  for patients undergoing salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy .  
After consent, a t the time of scheduled surgery , the MAKO 7 procedure  will be performed . Following 
placement of the hysteroscope,  the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868679] i s located, the distal tip of the device will be 
placed at the tubal ostium and the balloon will be deployed through the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916].  Cells are 
captured on the surface  of the balloon . The balloon will then be retracted into the device’s sheath. The 
device is then withdrawn from the working channel of the hysteroscope and the distal end of the device 
will be cut and placed in a cytopreservative. The sample will be labeled with the Subj ect’s study 
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN [ADDRESS_1212450]’s study identification number, to a Cytology Core Lab, which  will be used  for all sites .  
Cytological  analysis will be performed by a board -certified  pathologist blinded to the surgical pathology 
results  .  
Once the ovary (ies)  and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916] (s) have been surgically excised, they will be sent to the 
pathology center of the clinical site. The fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868680] 7 
device will be compared to the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868681] . The cytology sample will be 
evaluated for adequacy in enabling determination and/or differentiation of normal versus atypi[INVESTIGATOR_868682].  The cytology report will include classification of the cytology sample.

protocol.  
 
nVision Medical Corporation - Confidential  
CLIN [ADDRESS_1212457] provides informed consent.   
Clinical data will be collected on all subjects beginning at the time of  informed consent (i.e. enrollment), 
through  study  exit,  which is  [ADDRESS_1212458]’s 
medical records and other source documents  in order to complete study case report forms  (CRFs). 
Surgical pathology information and cyt ological evaluation of MAKO 7 obtained samples will also  be 
collected  using case report forms (CRFs). Sponsor monitors (or designees) will review the data 
submitted per the monitoring plan. Informed Consent and data  will be 100% source ve rified.   
Each subject will be assigned a unique study identification number, which de -identifies the individual 
and contains no protected health information (PHI). Study identification numbers will be assigned at 
the site sponsor using a prescribed procedu re. Each site will maintain a screening and enrollment log 
key that links the Subject’s study identification number to the PHI, is stored in a secure location at the 
site and is only accessible to the site personnel and the Sponsor . 
Any source documentation (procedure reports, lab reports, etc.) that is sent to the Sponsor will have 
all subject  identifiers removed and be identified only with the Subject ’s study identification

the study through study exit  (where exit is defined as [ADDRESS_1212462]).Table  All adverse events will be categorized for severity , 
seriousness,  and relatedness to the MAKO 7 device or MAKO 7  procedure. In addition, if the 
Investigator determines that the adverse event is serious (whether anticipated or unanticipated), 
a Serious Adverse Event  case report form will be completed and the IRB is notified in accordance 
with local requirements.   The Sponsor should also be notified within 24 hours of all serious 
adverse events  (whether anticipated or unanticipated).  This will ensure any related device 
investigations  are performed by [CONTACT_868704] 21 CFR part 812.  
All adverse event s that are  serious (whether an ticipated or unanticipated), MAKO [ADDRESS_1212463] study exit ([ADDRESS_1212464]) will be closed upon Subject study exit.  
The associated MAKO 7 risks and mitigation strategy are detailed in Table 3 below.  
Table 3. Potential Adverse Events related to the MAKO 7 d evice and Mitigation Strategy  
Risk Mitigation  
Perforation of the 
fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_868688] a risk 
because of its tortuosity 
and narrow dimensions.  
 a. No rigid portion of the device enters the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916]. Instead, a 
very small balloon (less than 1 mm diameter) i s everted through 
the tube. Because the balloon is self -navigating, the eversion of 
the balloon will minimize  the physician’s manual advancement of 
the device through the tube and therefore the risk of perforation 
is expected to be minimized.  
b. A salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy will be performed directly after the 
MAKO [ADDRESS_1212465] and investigational supplies used for the clinical study.  
Sponsor  will supply the MAKO 7 d evice. An inventory of clean and sterile MAKO 7 d evices 
will either be shipped or brought to the investigational site.  Packaging will be labeled 
“Investigational Device” and the Instructions for Use (IFU) will accompany each product in 
the shipment.    
11.3.2.  Device Supply Storage  
Sponsor  clinical supplies provided  under this investigational protocol can only be used for 
procedures under this investigational protocol.  Clinical supplies provided for this 
investigational protocol must be kept in a designated secure location and may not be mixed 
with commercial invent ory for any other purpose.  
All investigational supplies will be stored according to manufacturer specifications and 
separately from supplies purchased by [CONTACT_868705].  
11.3.3.  Device Malfunction

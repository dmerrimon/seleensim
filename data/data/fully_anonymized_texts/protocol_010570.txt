Metastatic d isease of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_649013] 20% of patients with cancer  and poses  a 
growing problem as improved neo-adjuvant strategies allow longer life expectancy. 
 
This is a Phase III multicenter clinical trial designed to prospe ctively evaluate the 
compar ative effectiveness of single-fraction and hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 
(SRS) in patients who underwent decompressive surgery for spi[INVESTIGATOR_649014] a

Eligible patients will have undergone spi[INVESTIGATOR_649015] d emonstrate post-operative 
separation between tumor and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_649016]. This is a 
non-inferiority study in which pa tients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either 
single-fraction SRS (24 Gy) or high-dose hypofractionated SRS (27 Gy in 3 fractions) within 
8 weeks of surgery. The treatment duration will be 1 to 7 days. 
 
Study enrollment of 150 patients will be comp leted within two years.  After randomization, 
patients will be followed up at  3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months (± 8 weeks) when poss ible or 
until death. The study duration will be up to four years. The primary endpoint will be local 
tumor control after SRS as monitored through imaging at follow up.

surgical indications include spi[INVESTIGATOR_649031]/or

3. 4 Radiobiology  of Stereotactic Radiosurgery  (SRS) 
 
Radiation therapy is a well-estab lished treatment for localized sp inal metastases13,14. The 
outcomes of treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_649039] b eam radiation 
therapy (cEBRT) delivered as a series of low-dose fractions have been  fairly well 
documen ted15-18. Several prospe ctive studies ha ve sho wn that response to cEBRT may be 
predicted based on  the primary tumor histology, leading to a dichotomization in 
characterizing tumor histologies as  either radiosensitive or radioresistant14,15,19,20. 
Hematologic malignancies were fairly uniformly considered radiosensitive, showing excellent 
local control rates after cEBRT.  Breast and prostate were also reported to consistently 
respond to cEBRT.  On the oth er hand, the majority of solid tumor metastases were 
classified as radioresistant to cEBRT. 
 
The doses of cEBRT that can be delivered to the tumor are often limited by [CONTACT_649096] a broad field.  On the other hand, 
image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) allows the delivery of several high-dose 
fractions or a single high-dose of radiation with very high spacial prec ision thereby [CONTACT_649097]21. 
 
Radiation employs numerous pathways in order to kill tumor cells. The mechanisms of tumor 
response from single-fraction radiotherapy may differ from that of fractionated radiotherapy. 
Laboratory data show that single-fraction high-dose radiation employs tumor kill pathways 
that are not recruited at low-dose radiation fractions22.  Radiation doses  above 8Gy induce 
vascular endothelial apoptosis through activation of sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway and 
the extent of apoptosis increases as the radiation dose increases from 11 to 25 Gy23. 
Furthermore, crypt stem cell clonogen apoptosis has been shown to require radiation doses 
that were on average 3.9 Gy higher than for endothelial apoptosis24. 
 
3.5 Single-fraction SRS 
 
Single-fraction spi[INVESTIGATOR_649040]13. The dose escalation study of single-fraction SRS treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_649041] 24 Gy dose resulted in 3-year 
recurrence risk of 2.4% which was significantly better than the 10% risk after lower doses21,25. 
Furthermore, tumor control was independent of tumor volume and histology.  MD Anderson 
reported similar tumor control along with improvement in the quality of life26. 
 
3.6 Hypofractionated  SRS 
 
Hypofractionated SRS was used  to treat seventy-four spi[INVESTIGATOR_158308], with actuarial one- 
year local control rate of 84%27. The radiation was administered in five 6 Gy fractions or in 
three 9 Gy fractions, without a statistically significant difference  in tumor control.  Similar 
results were reported after five fractions to a total dose from 30 Gy to 35 Gy (1-year 80% and 
2-year 73% actuarial local control). The experience in the use of hypofractionated SRS in 
the treatment of brain and lung tumors is more extensive and simi larly indicates  that 
hypofractionation provides a safe and effective treatment option28.

3.8 Quality of Life Measures: MDASI and BPI 
 
[INVESTIGATOR_649042], we aim to assess a variety of symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_649099]  3, 6, 9, 12, 
18, and 24 months (± 8 weeks) after treatment during follow up car e. In order to measure 
this, we will utilize the MD Anderson  Symptom Inventory – Spi[INVESTIGATOR_345028] (MDASI) as 
an optional measure to evaluate each coho rt of the study. MDASI has been validated as an 
instrument for use in clinical trials29,34,35 with Cronb ach alpha reliability ranges from 0.82 to 
0.9434. This instrument (see Appendix A) contains [ADDRESS_869931] 24 hours on a scale of 0 (not present) to 10 
(as bad  as you can  imagine). Thus, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Scoring 
of symptom severity and scori ng of symptom interference  will be p erformed as indicated  in 
the Outcome Measure section of the MDASI User Guide (see Appendix B). 
 
A sec ond optional tool we will emp loy is the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) to assess b oth the 
severity of pain experienced by  [CONTACT_649100] 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months (± 8 weeks) after 
treatment during follow up care. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_649043]29,[ADDRESS_869932] 24 hours (see Appendix C). 
Response formats include: Yes/No, scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad  as you can 
imagine), illustrated region(s) of pain, pain relief as measured  by 0% (no relief) - 100% 
(comp lete relief), pain interference of daily functions scale of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 
(comp letely interferes). Higher score  responses indicate more severe pain. No scori ng 
algorithm exists, however the arithmetic mean of the four most severe items can be  used as 
a measure of pain severity as indicated  in the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_649044] (see Appendix D). The

arithmetic mean of the seven interference items (of question 9)  can be used as a  measure of

3.[ADDRESS_869933].  However, h igher dose per fraction treatment (ie. single-fraction vs 
hypofractionated) may be assoc iated with a higher risk of vertebral body fractures and 
generally requires increased c omplexity of dose planning.  Clear delineation of the 
differenc es in tumor control and toxicity profile will facilitate the best treatment selection in 
the future. The current study is designed to prospectively study the safety and efficacy of 
post-operative SRS administered as either single-fraction or  hypofractionated dose and  to 
determine its impact on the quality of life.

renal function. The CT myelogram or  MRI perfusion will be p erformed at all participating 
sites. CT myelogram will be us ed for treatment planning, since sp inal instrumentation 
generates artifact in MR imaging which may complicate spi[INVESTIGATOR_649045]. For instances 
in which the CT myelogram cannot be tolerated by [CONTACT_102], MRI with perfusion will be an 
acceptable alternative for treatment planning.  However, post-operative MR imaging pro vides 
adequate resolution in order to reliably diagnose tumor recurrence and will be us ed to 
monitor patients for recurrence, unless p atients are una ble to undergo MR imaging. 
 
Patients who are  candidates for either single-fraction or  high-dose hypofractionated SRS will 
be recruited into the study and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the two treatment arms. 
An Acute  Toxicity Assessment (see Appendix E) will be p erformed via pho ne or c linic visit 
within 4 weeks (± 10 days) after the comp letion of SRS.  Patients will have the option to 
comp lete the MD Anderson  Symptom Inventory – Spi[INVESTIGATOR_345028] (MDASI) and the 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at the time of recruitment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24  months (± 8 
weeks) after their treatment during follow-up car e. At these same time points, the study 
investigators will comp lete the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_649046] (see Appendix F). Follow-up 
MRI imaging will also be  obtained at the same time points, including axial and sagittal T1, T2, 
STIR and gadolinium-enhanced T1 sequences. For those patients that are not candidates for

histology and/or previous radiation history.  Eligible patients will be recruited and  following 
informed consent will be randomized to undergo single-fraction (24Gy) or hypofractionated (3 
fractions of 9Gy, total d ose of 27Gy) SRS within eight weeks of having undergone spi[INVESTIGATOR_649047]. The co ntouring and dos imetry will be d one us ing standard 
institu tional practice and  dose con straints. If more than one lesion will require treatment, the 
patient will be e valuated for inclusion in the protocol.  If the other lesions meet the inclusion 
criteria, they will be treated acc ording to the randomization ass ignment for the index study 
lesion.  If they do not meet the inclusion criteria, they will be treated according to the 
discretion of the treatment team. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTI C/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS 
 
All patients enrolled in the study will undergo post-operative SRS.  This is a high-dose 
conformal radiation treatment delivered with high spacial prec ision us ing image-guided 
intens ity-modulated radiation therapy equipment  available at MSKCC, MGH, JHU, and 
Stanford. There is a  wealth of published institutional experience with this treatment. This 
device is F DA-approved for this indication. The only difference to be assessed in this study 
will be in the fractionation pattern, with both single-fraction doses and  hypofractionated doses 
having been safely used in the past. Dose constraints have been e numerated for single- 
fraction SRS (see Appendix G) and hypofractioned SRS (see Appendix H).

Potential subjects will be identified by  a member of the patient’s treatment team, the research 
team and/or the protocol investigators at MSKCC , MGH, JHU, or Stanford. All subjects for 
this study will be recruited from a pool of patients of the investigators. Subjects who appear 
to be eligible will be pre sented with the opportunity to participate. The study will be p osted on 
the clinicaltrials.gov website. Furthermore, the trial will be p osted on  the MSKCC website 
under clinical trials. 
 
Patients will be a pproac hed and con sented anytime between the pre-operative discuss ion 
about surgery and the start of SRS treatment planning. Once the post-operative CT 
myelogram or MRI perfusion demonstrates separation of tumor and the spi[INVESTIGATOR_649051], the patient will be randomized before the start of radiation 
treatment planning to receive either single-fraction or hypofractionated SRS within 8 weeks 
of surgery. The recruiting physicians will be familiar with the patient’s medical history and 
health status at the time of recruitment since they will be d irectly involved in the post- 
operative radiation planning and will not require a waiver of authorization.  Screening for the 
eligibility will not require collection of any additional patient information since a ll of the 
information required to determine patient eligibility will be required in order to appropriately 
plan the post-operative SRS. 
 
Patients will not be recruited outside of the post-operative treatment pathway and no 
advertisement or  patient compens ation will take place.

contoured according to standard institutional pra ctice to include the entire tumor visible on 
any of the pre- or post-operative imaging studies, including MRI and CT. Every attempt will 
be made to include the entire preoperative tumor volume into the GTV even if a part or all of 
it were resected during surgery. The clinical tumor volume (CTV) will be e xpanded to include 
all of the adjoining marrow spaces in the vertebral body as defined by [CONTACT_563066]38. The 
planned treatment volume (PTV) will be e xpanded 2-[ADDRESS_869939] myelogram or MRI perfusion 
will be e xcluded from all treatment contours. Inverse treatment planning will be car ried out 
with the goal of maximizing the percentage of PTV receiving the 100% of the planned dose 
with a requirement of PTV V100 ≥ 80%.  GTV Dmin >15 Gy will be required with a goal V100 
> 90%. The prescribed dose will be n ormalized to the 100% isodose line or its equivalent, 
depending upon institutional prac tices.  In order to account for variability of delivery systems, 
doses will be presc ribed that are equivalent to the absolute dose stipulated in the protocol. 
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) may potentially be uti lized.  In order  to ensure 
homogeneity of treatment plans among institutions, the first three treatment volumes  from 
each institution will be reviewed by [CONTACT_649102] d iscuss ed in ord er to arrive at consensus.

11.0 TOXICITIE S/SIDE EFFECTS  
11.1 Toxicities/Complications 
 
Subjects will be monitored for surgical complications. Our retrospective study found that major 
surgical complications occ urred in 14.3% patients within 30 days of surgery. Among those 
patients that suffered comp lications from surgery within 30 days, Table 2 below depi[INVESTIGATOR_649056]6,39: 
 
Table 2: Postoperative Complications 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cerebrosp inal fluid leak is a rare complication, 
occurring after less than 5% of operations. 
Neurologic injury is an exceedingly rare post- 
operative complication, occurring after far less 
than 1% of operations. 
 
Patients will also be  monitored for radiation 
toxicity including: acute (≤90 days from the start 
of treatment) and late (>90 days) toxicity.  All patients are going to be monitored for skin, 
subcutane ous tissue, spi[INVESTIGATOR_649057].  In add ition, patients undergoing 
cervical radiation will be monitored for mucous membrane, pharynx and esop hagus, larynx 
and upp er GI toxicity.  Patients undergoing thoracic radiation will be monitored for upper and 
lower GI, lung and  heart toxicity.  Patients undergoing lumbar radiation will be monitored for 
genitourinary and lower GI toxicity.  The severity of the toxicity will be gr aded acco rding to 
Appendix I (Acute Radiation Toxicity) and Appendix J (Late Radiation Toxicity) based on  the 
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group classification schema. 
 
Low-grade radiation-related toxicity may include fatigue, skin erythema, subcutaneous 
fibrosis and bone pain. More significant toxicity is rare (<1%) and may include esop hagitis, 
IRB 14 -233: A (2) 
Amended: 16-MAR-2016  Page  14 of 33  
  
pericarditis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, myelitis, acute radiation 
pneumonitis, late pulmonary fibrosis, esophageal stricture, small bowel obstruction and 
radiation enteritis. 
 
Participants should not be or b ecome  pregnant during the course of treatment because the 
radiation used  in this study may be teratogenic. Participating sites shou ld notify the MSK PI [INVESTIGATOR_649058] p articipant becomes pregnant. 
 
11. 2 Adverse Events (AE) 
Defined 
An adverse event is defined as the appearance of (or worsen ing of any pre-existing) 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after treatment. For this 
study, we cons ider reportable adverse events to include radiation Grade 3 (and above) 
toxicity as enume rated in Section 11.1. Adverse events should be reported to both the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_649059], please see Section 16.0.3. 
 
Reporting Requirements 
 
For non-serious adverse events, we will only be capturing toxicities that are poss ibly related 
to study participation. Adverse event monitoring will be co ntinued for 24 months following the 
comp letion of SRS treatment or until the time of death if death occurs prior to the 24  month 
follow-up. Adverse events should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather 
than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, 
each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event. Adverse events will 
be reported within 14 days. 
 
Adverse events will be ass essed by  [CONTACT_649104] (CTCAE) version 4.0 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  If CTCAE grading does  not exist for an adverse event, the severity 
of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening, corresponding to Grades 1-4, will be us ed. 
 
As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
 
1.  The severity grade  (CTCAE Grade 1-4) 
2.  Its duration (start and end dates or Ongoing at  End of Study) 
3.  Its relationship to the study treatment (reasonable possibility that AE is related to 
study: No, Yes) 
4.  Action taken with respect to study (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted,  
permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable) 
5.  Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant medication/non-drug 
therapy, concomita nt medication/non-drug therapy) 
6.  Whether it is serious, where a SAE is defined as in Secti on 17.2 (SAE) 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or n on-drug 
therapy is given, this action sh ould be recorded on the Adverse Event form in CRDB. Once 
an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or  until it is judged to 
be permanent.

12.0 CRITERIA FOR THE RAPEUTIC  RESPONS E/OUTCOME  ASSES SMENT 
The primary study endpoint, which is l ocal tumor control, will be radiographically determined 
according to routine standard of care post-surgical and post -treatment imaging (MRI or CT) 
of the sp ine.  Local tumor control will be d efined as the lack of local tumor progression at the 
irradiated site on follow-up imaging.  All imaging studies from collaborating institu tions will be 
submitted for central review at MSK. T1, T1 gadolinium enhanced, T2 and  STIR MR 
sequences will be us ed for follow-up imaging in order to monitor treatment response. 3-5mm 
slice thickness on MR imaging will be us ed. We will avoid strict imaging parameter 
restrictions since several medical ce nters will take part in the study and it will be ch allenging 
to strictly confine imaging criteria. Standard MRI sequences will be s ufficient in order to 
monitor for recurrence. Volumetric measurements will not be used in this protocol. CT will be 
used in p atients who ca nnot undergo MR imaging. 
 
Each month, the imaging studies from participating sites will be batched and submitted 
through MSK’s FTP Imaging Secure File Tran sfer system to the MSK PI. These scans 
should be de-identified prior to submission to MSK.  The study RSA will transfer images to 
MSK’s electronic Research PACS system. Central review will be ca rried out at two week 
intervals by [CONTACT_649105] ([CONTACT_649121] and [CONTACT_649122]) with expertise in 
interpretation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_649060]. In cases of disagreement of the initial radiology 
read and  central review interpretation, the results will be d iscuss ed with the treating surgeon 
or radiation onco logist in order  to reach agreement. Site investigators will be notified of the 
review results within 24 hours.  The turn-around time for central imaging review will be 14  
days. Progression will be d efined quantitatively as a 15% increase in maximal horizontal and 
vertical diameter, when not  accounted for by [CONTACT_649106]. The 
duration of response will be measured as lack of progression on imaging or until the last 
follow-up visit. 
 
Secondary endpoints will include clinical determination of MRC muscle strength assessment, 
ECOG, ASIA, and treatment-related toxicity at each follow-up visit. 
 
Secondary endpoint comparison of quality of life between the two cohor ts will be d etermined 
through optional patient-reported responses for the MDASI - Spi[INVESTIGATOR_649061]. The MDASI Spi[INVESTIGATOR_649062] (questions #14-18) will be scored 
separately as a Spi[INVESTIGATOR_649063]. 
 
Secondary endpoint comparison of pain control will be d etermined through optional patient- 
reported responses of the BPI. Pain severity at its worst (question #5) and the average of the 
pain interference (average of question #9) will serve as the pain end points. 
 
12.1 CRITERIA FOR RADIOGR APHIC TUMOR PRO GRESS ION 
 
 
Local disease progress ion will be d efined as evident in the following ways: 
• New or progress ive paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_476893] 5% increase in enhancing soft tissue  mass 
not accounted for by [CONTACT_649107], 
• New bone destruction not accounted for by [CONTACT_649108].

• Patient death 
 
14.[ADDRESS_869945]-operative spi[INVESTIGATOR_484420] (SRS). A noninferiority study 
design is justified on  the basis that both treatment options have their advantages and 
disadvantages with currently mixed data abo ut the relative tumor control offered by 
[CONTACT_649109]-fraction SRS.  Some data suggest that single-fraction SRS may 
offer superior local control and since on ly one treatment visit is required it is cheaper and 
more convenient for patients. On the other hand, data suggest that single-fraction treatment 
may be ass ociated with a higher risk of vertebral body fractures, which is considered a 
treatment-related toxicity.  Determining whether single-fraction SRS and hypofractionated 
SRS offer comparable local tumor control will allow physicians to make treatment decisions 
based on  factors such  as cost and toxicity risk. 
 
Lack of local radiograph ic progress ion will be d efined as local tumor control.  Patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 fashion and the local control in the two treatment arms (single-fraction 
SRS vs. hypofractionated SRS) will be ass essed. The patients will be s tratified acc ording to 
participating center (MSK, MGH, JHH, Stanford), presence  or absence of prior radiation 
history at the study level, and radioresistance of the prim ary tumor histology, with breast and 
prostate classified as radiosensitive and the remaining solid tumor metastases (i.e. 
melanoma, sarcoma, thyroid, renal, colorectal) classified as  radioresistant. 
 
An intent-to-treat, stratified log rank test will be used to test whether or not the single-fraction 
SRS arm is inferior to the hypofractionated (3 fractions in total) SRS arm in terms of the local 
control rate. To set up a formal test we will use the 1-year local control rate as the surrogate 
of the efficacy (assumi ng that the two survival curves follow exponential distributions) and 
allow a 10%  inferior margin. From a clinical standpoint, the investigators agreed that a 
difference  of less than 10% is not regarded  as significant. On this basis, we permit a 10% 
inferior margin. I.e., we will test H0: P1≤(P2-10%) vs H1: P1>(P2-10%), where P1 and P [ADDRESS_869946], we estimate that the 3-fraction arm will yield a 
1-year local control rate around 8 5% based on interim preliminary data from a multicenter 
Phase III trial (Protocol 10-154), and set the type I er ror (that is, declare single-fraction arm 
noninferior while it is not) rate at 0.10. When the two arms have equal efficacy, i.e., P1 = P2 = 
85%, the power (that is, declare the single-fraction arm noninferior while it is) of this 
noninferiority test40 is 80% when there are 75 patients in each arm. Besides, since deaths 
without local failure are likely, competing risk analysis will also be  used to estim ate the local

each eligible lesion (non-contiguous lesions treated with a separate radiation co ntour) will be

planned. Three interim analyses a re planned and  will be co nducted at the time of the DSMB 
annual review of the study. The O’Brien-Flemming bou ndary will be a pplied for assessing 
statistical significance. Specifically, the rejection regions in terms of the corresponding Z- 
scores  are Z>3.09, Z>2.06, Z>1.63 and Z>1.[ADDRESS_869947] SRS is less than 10%. All grade [ADDRESS_869948] (SPRT), each arm of the study is monitored for any

15.0 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE S 
 
15.1 Research Par ticipant Registration 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility. 
Obtain informed co nsent, by [CONTACT_114498]. 
 
During the registration process registering individuals will be required to complete a protocol 
specific Eligibility Checklist. 
 
All participants must be registered through the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) Office 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is available Monday through Friday from 
8:30am  – 5:30pm at [PHONE_214]. Registrations must be submitted via the PPR Electronic 
Registration System (http://ppr/). The completed signature [CONTACT_649120]/RA or

verbal sc ript/RA, a comp leted Eligibility Checklist and other relevant documents must be 
uploaded via the PPR Electronic Registration System. 
 
 
15.1.1 For Participating Sites: 
 
Central registration for this study will take place at Memorial Sloan Ket tering Cancer Center 
(MSKCC). 
 
 
To comp lete registration and enroll a participant from another institution, the study staff at 
that site must contact [CONTACT_188769]/her of the 
participant registration. The site  staff then needs to email registration/eligibility documen ts 
per the co ntact information pro vided by [CONTACT_649111]. These d ocuments 
must be sent via a secure, encrypted email. 
The following docume nts must be sent for each enrollment within 24 hours of the informed 
consent form being signed: 
• The comp leted or partially comp leted MSKCC eligibility checklist 
• The signed informed consent and HIPAA Authorization form 
• Supporting source documentation (containing a minimum of two patient identifiers such 
as da te of birth and  initials) for eligibility questions (pathology report, radiology reports, 
MD notes, physical exam sheets, medical history, prior treatment records). 
 
 
Upon receipt, the research staff at Memorial Sloan Ket tering Cancer Center will conduct an 
interim review of all documents.  If the eligibility checklist is not complete, the patient will be 
registered PEND ING and the site is responsible for sending a completed form within [ADDRESS_869951] is complete, p articipant meets all criteria, all source docume ntation is 
received, the participating site IRB has granted approval for the protocol, and the site is in 
good standing with MSKCC, the MSKCC research staff will send the completed registration 
documen ts to the MSKCC Protocol  Participant Registration (PPR) Office to be enrolled as 
stated in section 15.1. The participant will be registered. 
 
Once e ligibility has been estab lished and  the participant is registered, the participant will be 
assigned an MSKCC Clinical Research Database (CRD B) number (protocol participant 
number). This number is unique to the participant and must be written on  all data and 
correspondence for the participant. This protocol participant number will be relayed back to 
study staff at the registering site via e-mail and will serve as the enrollment confirmation. 
15.2 Randomization 
 
Randomization will be ce ntralized at  MSKCC . Patients will be randomized to the single dose 
arm (24 Gy) or the multi-dose arm (27 Gy in 3 fractions). Ineligible lesions and other lesions 
not being treated on  protocol will be treated according to standard of care at the physician’s 
discretion. Immediately after consent is obtained at MSKCC and at participating sites, the 
RSA will register participants in the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) system. Once the 
participant’s e ligibility is estab lished, the registration will be finalized and the participants will

Amended: 16-MAR-2016  Page  19 of 33  
  
be randomized us ing the Clinical Research Database (CRDB ). Randomization will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_30579], and will be s tratified by  [CONTACT_539575], 
prior radiation history, and radiorespo nsiveness of the primary disease site  (radiorespo nsive 
tumors include prostate, lung, brea st, etc and non-responsive tumors include melanoma, 
renal cell, colon and sarcoma). After the treatment arm is determined by [CONTACT_17628], the 
RSA will notify the research staff and/or investigators at MSKCC and participating sites of the 
treatment arm and participant ID via email within 24 hours of randomization. 
 
Data will be co llected at other ce nters and se nt to the RSA(s) at MSKCC accord ing to Table

16.1 Quality Assurance 
 
Principal investigators will maintain complete and accurate medical and treatment histories in 
the patients’ medical records.  The data will be p rospectively entered by [CONTACT_649114]-up 
events.  The RSA will assist the PI [INVESTIGATOR_649072]. The RSA will confirm up-front 
registration of all subjects, verify eligibility by [CONTACT_649115], review records to confirm that informed co nsent is 
proper ly obtained and  procedures are performed according to study protocol, and monitor 
protocol accrual. A weekly meeting with participation of the investigators and the RSA will be 
held in order  to review the data collected  each week and to address omiss ions and 
inconsistencies in the data to maintain compliance to the protocol. 
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accrua ls and comp leteness 
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data 
and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and  extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will 
be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential prob lems will be bro ught 
to the attention of the study team for discuss ion and acti on. 
 
Random-sample data quality and protocol  comp liance aud its will be co nducted  by [CONTACT_123894]. 
 
 
16.1.1 Quality Assurance for Participating Sites 
 
Each site accru ing participants to this protocol will be audited by [CONTACT_649116] C 
study team for protocol and regulatory comp liance, data verification and source 
documen tation. 
 
Audits will be conducted annually during the study (or more frequently if indicated ), and at 
the end or closeout of the trial. The number of participants audited will be determined by 
[CONTACT_649117]. Each audit will be summarized and a 
final report will be se nt to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_188742] 30 days of the aud it.

16.1.2 Response Review 
 
 
Since therapeutic efficacy is a stated primary objective, all sites participant’s responses are 
subject to review by [CONTACT_30588]’ s Therapeutic Response Review Committee (TRRC ). 
Radiology will need to be obtained from the participating sites for MSKCC TRRC review and 
confirmation of response assessment. These materials must be sent to MSKCC pro mptly 
upon request. 
 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by  [CONTACT_30589] 2001. The plans address  the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can  be found at: 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm-guidelines/page1. The DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were estab lished and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://inside2/clinresear ch/Docume nts/MSKCC %20Data%20and%20 Safety%20Monitoring% 
20Plans.pdf 
 
There are several d ifferent mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety 
and quality.  There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on  clinical research QA) and dep artmental proced ures for quality control, plus 
there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the acti vities of our 
clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I a nd II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol  development and review process, e ach protocol will be ass essed  for its

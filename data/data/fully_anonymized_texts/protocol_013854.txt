2 Study 001: Short t erm effects of carbidopa-l evodopa i n Neovascular AMD 
Synopsis 
In 2008, [CONTACT_314506] McKay identified a receptor,  GPR 143, on the surface of RPE cells and 
discovered that L-D OPA was  the natural ligand or stimulator of GPR143.  He showed that 
treatment of RPE cells with exogenous L-D OPA resulted in the release of additional PEDF.  
In subsequent work his group also showed that L-D OPA stimulation o f PEDF in RPE cells 
was also associated with a decrease in VEGF.   Thus, McKay hypothesized that exogenous 
L-DOPA may p revent
 the onset of AMD or progression to wet AMD.
In 2015, McKay and his associates published a paper  that showed that patients, who had been 
treated with  
L-DOPA, had a delay in the onset of AMD by [ADDRESS_471667].  
Since there are no established animal models for AMD, and  L-D OPA has a good  safety p rofile 
in healthy volunteers and patients with Parkinson’s disease, we initiated  a prospective trial 
to show efficacy in patients with neovascular AMD.  Th is trial is in patients who have not 
had intraocular  anti-V EGF injectio ns.  This trial will also  evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of L-D OPA,  in this population of patients with Wet AMD. The patients will be made aware 
of potential side effects of L-D OPA. 
Design: Prospective, two parallel group, open label  
Objectives    
[ADDRESS_471668], within 30 days, in patients with choroidal 
neovascular AMD. 
2 To
 d
etermine whether L-D OPA-c arbidopa s upplementation can improve or 
stabilize visual function within 30 days, in patients with choroidal neovascular AMD, 
by [CONTACT_376923]. 
3 To evaluate the relative benefits of carbidopa-l evodopa 25-1 00 mg, one tablet  
once daily hs and one tablet TID 
4 To determine whether L-D OPA-c arbidopa supplementation is well tolerated in  
our target group of patients with wet AMD in one eye. 
3 Inclusion criteria  
1 A diagnosis of AMD with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in one eye.  
2 Not previously treated with  anti-VEGF  injections.  
3 Normal or dry AMD of any grade in the second eye. 
4 Age 50-8 5 years.  
5 Willing ness to maintain AREDS vitamin supplements throughout the study, or remain off 
these supplements for the duration of the study, if not taking them prior to the study;  
Treatments:  
Patients
 receive either  open label, carbidopa  25-100  mg, one tablet once daily  hs for one  month 
or one tablet  dosed three times daily, in the morning, with supper and hs for o ne month (100 or 
300 mg of levodopa daily). This is the equivalent of very low to low doses o f  carbidopa-
levodopa in patients with  Parkinson’s disease. 
Each 
patient will be reevaluated at weekly ( 5-8 day) intervals.  
Duration: up to
 [ADDRESS_471669].  At  the end of the study, patients will be eligible to 
enter
 Study 002.  
Measurements and Activities: 
1 Ophthalmic history and comprehensive eye examination; including visual acuity,  with best 
correction, using an EDTRS chart, in both eyes prior to randomization, and ophthalmoscopic 
eye
 examination, and OCT;   
[ADDRESS_471670] at weekly v isits;  
Criteria
 for anti-V EGF injections  
This 
will be based on: weekly e valuation  of ETDRS visual acuity ( decrease of 5 letters from 
previous visit); increased macular thickness (compared to normal and previous visit as 
measured by
 [CONTACT_63396]);  new blood (hemorrhage on direct r etinal examination; or s ubjective 
decrease in vision.  If any of these criteria are  met, or if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_376922], or the patient’s Retina Specialist, the patient  requires anti-V EGF therapy, 
the patient will have an anti-V EGF intraocular injection,  by [CONTACT_376924] R etina Sp ecialist. If 
none of these criteria are met at visits 2 , 3 or 4, with patient agreement, anti-V EGF injection 
will not be done, and the patient will be reevaluated in 1 week.

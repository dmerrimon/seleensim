       e.  Please explain if there is a discrepancy in participant numbers (e.g., more participants
responded to a survey than had been approved):
We originally requested 60 overweight/obese adult volunteers (men and women) will be
enrolled.  Additionally it was stated in the protocol- “However, the number enrolled maybe
higher in the event of enrollment of replacement subjects for dropout(s) that discontinued for
reasons other than an adverse event due to study medication. In the event of a replacement
subject being enrolled, this subject will complete all visits”.
Please also note- the approval letter states approval for 50.  To clarify the above statement, as
a part of this continuing review we are amending the protocol to request recruitment of a total of

THIS PROTOCOL IS AN AMENDED/SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF IRB PROTOCOL 14-5531H.
Dapagliflozin is a medicine to treat diabetes.  Its mechanism of action is via sodium-glucose co-transporter
2 (SGLT2) inhibition.  In adults with diabetes, use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is
associated with moderate weight (fat) loss, in addition to other health benefits, including decreased blood
pressure, decreased inflammation, and decreased oxidative stress. It is unclear as to whether these health

OVERVIEW
This is a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, double blind, repeated measures study.  60
overweight/obese adults (body mass index > 27.5 kg/m^2) will be recruited for participation and randomly
assigned to one of two 12 week treatments: (1) daily oral administration of Dapagliflozin with dietary
counseling to promote weight loss; or, (2) daily oral administration of a placebo with dietary counseling to
promote weight loss.
Study participants will report to the research facilities on the Colorado State University main campus on 29
separate occasions:
Visit 1: study participants will undergo screening: medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram and blood
pressure assessment at rest and during incremental exercise to volitional exhaustion, blood sampling, and
measurement of body composition.
Visit 2: an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed and resting metabolic rate and blood pressure will

be measured.
Visit 3: appetite and hunger will be assessed and participants will be given a 3-dietary record form to
complete.
Visits 4-27: 12 weeks of nutrition counseling/weighing (upto 2 visits per week for 12 weeks).  Concurrent
with these visits, research participants will ingest, on a daily basis, either Dapagliflozin or placebo.
Visit 28: an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed and resting metabolic rate and blood pressure will
be measured.
Visit 29: appetite and hunger will be assessed; body composition will be measured, and participants will be
given a 3-day dietary record form to complete.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURES
Visit 1: study participants will provide informed consent and undergo screening: medical history, 12-lead
electrocardiogram and blood pressure assessment at rest and during incremental exercise to volitional
exhaustion, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition.
These screening procedures are standard for our lab.  Each of the procedures is currently active in other
IRB-approved protocols (e.g. 12-3767H, 08-611H, 14-4756H).
Health History - Potential participants will complete a standardized health history questionnaire that will
address past and present medication use, allergies, past and present medical conditions and physical
injuries, and habitual use of alcohol and tobacco.
Body composition - Percent body-fat, fat-free mass, total and regional adipose tissue mass, and total bone
mineral density will be determined using a whole-body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan (DEXA,
Model DPX-IQ Lunar Corp., Madison, WI).
Maximal graded exercise stress testing - A 12-lead ECG, arterial blood pressure (brachial
sphygmomanometer) will be obtained during quiet resting conditions in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_467633], and during incremental stationary cycle ergometer or treadmill exercise until volitional fatigue.
During exercise, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and ventilation may be determined by
[CONTACT_46146].  All data from these tests will be will be reviewed by a cardiologist.  Only those
subjects demonstrating no signs or symptoms of disease will be invited to participate in the study.
Blood sampling – Blood (~ 20 ml) will be sampled from an antecubital or hand vein for subsequent analysis
of circulating factors pertinent to inclusion/exclusion criteria, including glucose, aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,and  total bilirubin.  These blood analyses will be performed in
on-site (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467634], Abaxis, Union City, CA). Testing for Hepatitis B/C will be performed at a local,
external clinical lab (e.g. University of Colorado-Health North).  Per the Medical Monitor’s discretion follow
up blood draws maybe requested.
Visit 2: Resting Metabolic Rate (ventilated hood technique,indirect calorimetry) for [ADDRESS_599346] will be performed.

These procedures are standard for our lab.  Each of the procedures is currently active in other IRB-
approved protocols (e.g. 14-5201H).
Blood pressure will be determined three times using the left arm via standard procedures. Each
assessment will be separated by [ADDRESS_599347] 75 g of dextrose dissolved in 250 ml of water over 10-minutes.  Venous blood (~ 9 ml) will be
sampled at time 0 (baseline) and 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 105 and 120 minutes for determination of
concentration of blood glucose (2300 STAT Plus Glucose Lactate Analyzer, YSI Inc., Yellow Springs,
Ohio), and insulin (commercially available assay).
Prior to the start of the oral glucose tolerance test, venous blood (~ 20 ml) will be sampled, and
plasma/serum and red cells isolated and stored at -70°C for subsequent analysis of circulating markers of
inflammation (High sensitive C-Reactive Protein, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha, and Interleukin 6) and
oxidative stress (oxidized low density lipoprotein concentration, and thiobarbituric acid reactive
substances).
Visit 3: Appetite and hunger will be assessed.
These procedures are standard for our lab.  Each of the procedures is currently active in other IRB-
approved protocols (e.g. 12-3567H).
On a day different to the oral glucose tolerance day, participants will report to the laboratory early in the
morning, following a 12-hour fast and 24-hour abstention from exercise. An intravenous catheter will be
inserted into an antecubital or hand vein and kept patent with a saline drip. Participants will be provided
with a standardized “priming meal” comprising a commercially available, mixed-nutrient liquid meal, dosed
to 1 kcal per kg body mass (Ensure, Ross Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL; 64% CHO, 22% fat, 14% protein).
One hour following consumption of this priming meal, participants will be presented with a pre-weighed
buffet of food from which they will have opportunity to eat ad libitum quantities over a 30 minute period.
The remaining uneaten food will be reweighed and participants’ energy and macronutrient intakes will later
be determined using the Food Intake Analysis System software (U [LOCATION_007] Health Sciences Center,
Houston). Prior to the standardized primer meal, and to the buffet, and then every 60 minutes over 3 hours
following the buffet, participants will be asked to rate their perceptions of hunger and satiety using a visual
analog scale. At these same time points, venous blood (~ 20 ml) will be sampled, and plasma/serum
isolated and stored at -70°C for subsequent determination of concentrations of hunger and satiety
hormones (e.g. ghrelin, peptide YY, leptin, and insulin). At the conclusion of these tests, the study
participant will give a form in which to record the amounts of food and beverage (except water) they eat
and drink for three consecutive days, including 2 week days and 1 weekend day. Upon completion of the
food records, the form will be returned to the research team. This information will be used to establish
baseline dietary intake and will be useful information for the nutrition counselors seeking to help the
participants lose weight.

3. Background
a) Describe past experimental and/or clinical findings leading to the formulation of the study, if applicable.
Aside from the metabolic benefits pertaining to glucose control, inhibition of sodium-glucose co-transporter
2 (SGLT2) in patients is associated with moderate weight loss (Tahrani et al., 2011; Chen & Leung, 2013),
with some studies reporting up to 4.5 kg decreases in body mass over 12 weeks (Wilding et al., 2009).
Animal data are consistent with these observations (Devenny et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2012). SGLT2
inhibition is also associated with other health benefits, including decreased blood pressure (Ferrannini et
al., 2010; Dobbins et al., 2012), decreased inflammation (Chen et al., 2012; Tahara et al., 2013, 2014),
and decreased oxidative stress (Tahara et al., 2013, 2014)—all health benefits with very important
implications for improved physiological function and decreased disease-risk. At present, it is unclear as to
whether these health benefits are due to SGLT2 inhibition per se, or as a secondary effect of weight loss.
Noteworthy, the weight loss observed in patients associated with SGLT2 inhibition is not mediated by
[CONTACT_467646]/intervention.  It is more likely to be mediated by [CONTACT_467647], leading to urinary glucose excretions ranging
between 45 and 80 g/day (180-320 kcal/d), depending on the drug dose (Idris & Donnelly, 2009). This
caloric deficit is not trivial. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], caloric deficits of this magnitude require either increased physical
activity and/or dietary restriction.
In our original study (Protocol 14-5531H) we learned that when adults with normal, healthy glucose control
use SGLT2 inhibitors, the weight loss is negligible.  Nevertheless, even in healthy adults, SGLT2 inhibition
leads to glucose spi[INVESTIGATOR_467635], non-wight loss mediated health benefits. Therefore
in the current project we will study the use of SGLT2 inhibitors combined with dietary counseling for weight
loss.
The limitations of the use of dietary restriction for weight loss and, perhaps more importantly, sustained
lower weight maintenance, are well described (MacLean et al., 2006; Strohacker et al., 2014). In response
to diet-induced weight loss several biological factors, including increased appetite owing to elevation of the
orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, and decreased anorexigenic hormones like peptide YY (PYY), promote
increased dietary intake and subsequently weight re-gain. However, it is biologically plausible that the
weight loss accompanying SGLT2 inhibition may not be accompanied by [CONTACT_467648]/ingest calories (carbohydrates), but limits the ability for
internal storage. That is, during eating, nutrient sensors within the gut release satiety factors to inhibit
further dietary intake (Schaeffer et al., 2014; Strohacker et al., 2014). Ingesting calories as carbohydrates
while using SGLT2 inhibitors may allow for normal satiety signaling while limiting caloric storage, thus
thwarting biological impediments to long-term weight loss.

thwarting biological impediments to long-term weight loss.
Accordingly, in light of the rationale provided, we wish to determine if: 1.  Dapagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibition)
provides additional health benefits to dietary counseling for weight loss?  2. Weight loss associated with
dietary counseling and the use of  Dapagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibition) is characterized by [CONTACT_467649]-induced changes in circulating peptides that increase hunger and
reduce satiety.

Subject Population - In the space below, please detail the participants that you are requesting to recruit
(include requested participant number and description of each group requested).  (Input N/A if not
applicable)
a) Requested Participant Description (Include number of participants that you plan to study and description of
each group requested, if applicable).
60 overweight/obese adult volunteers (men and women) will be studied.  However, the number enrolled
may be higher in the event of enrollment of replacement subjects for dropout(s) that discontinued for
reasons other than an adverse event due to study medication. In the event of a replacement subject being
enrolled, this subject will complete all visits. Therefore we would like to enroll 200 participants.
Participants previously enrolled in 14-5531H and withdrawn due to new information will be contact[CONTACT_467652]. Several procedures, such as screening and DEXA, OGTT, will not be
redone, but will be released for the purposes of this purpose. You can find the participant letter that went
out to those participants in the attachments section.
 
b) What is the rationale for studying the requested group(s) of participants?
Adults who are overweight/obese are at the greatest risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 diabetes, thus
overweight/obese adults potentially have the most to gain should the outcome of the study prove
favorable.  Inclusion of adults already diagnosed with diabetes might complicate the interpretation of the
data; that is, as a consequence of the patho-physiology associated with diabetes, the response to our
feeding treatment with or without Dapagliflozin may differ in adults with diabetes compared with adults who
are diabetes free.
 
c) If applicable, state the rationale for involvement of potentially vulnerable subjects to be entered into the
study, including minors, pregnant women, economically and educationally disadvantaged, or decisionally
impaired subjects. Specify the measures being taken to minimize the risks and the chance of harm to the
potentially vulnerable subjects.
Potentially vulnerable subjects will not be studied.
 
d) If women, minorities, or minors are not included, a clear compelling rationale must be provided. Examples
for not including minors: disease does not occur in children; drug or device would interfere with normal
growth and development; etc.
Women and minorities will be invited to participate.  Minors will be excluded.  The prevalence of type [ADDRESS_599351] not been established.
 
e) State if any of the subjects are students, employees, or laboratory personnel. They should be presented
with the same written informed consent. If compensation is allowed, they should also receive it.

same written informed consent; compensation is allowed, they will also receive it.
 
f)  Describe how potential subjects will be identified for recruitment (e.g., chart review, referral from individual's
treating physician, those individuals answering an ad). How will potential participants learn about the
research and how will they be recruited (e.g., flyer, email, web posting, telephone, etc.)? Attach recruitment
materials in the Attachment Section (#16). Important to remember: potential subjects may not be contact[CONTACT_152633].
Please see examples of recruitment materials in the attachment section.
Potential subjects will be recruited via electronic advertisement (e.g. The Source) and email lists (e.g. CSU
genfac).  If necessary, potential subjects may also be recruited via newspaper advertisement (e.g. The
Coloradoan), clinical trials websites (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov), and/or flyers/posters placed in public places
(e.g. coffee shops) in and around the Fort Collins area. Public places includes using approved recruitment
texts in social media forums.
 
g)  If applicable, provide rationale for the inclusion of healthy volunteers in this study. Specify any risks to
which these healthy volunteers may possibly be exposed. Specify the measures being taken to minimize
the risks and the chance of harm to these volunteers.
Adults who are overweight/obese but otherwise healthy will be invited to participate.  Inclusion of adults
already diagnosed with diabetes might complicate the interpretation of the data; that is, as a consequence
of the patho-physiology associated with diabetes, the response to feeding with or without Dapagliflozin
may differ in adults with diabetes compared with adults who are diabetes free.
It is not possible to identify all potential risks in research procedures, but the researcher(s) have taken
reasonable safeguards to minimize any known and potential (but unknown) risks.  The Human
Performance Clinical Research Laboratory has emergency supplies including a medicine trolley equipped
with heart machines and supplemental oxygen.  The research team has a great deal of experience with all
of the procedures.  Some of the procedures for which you are being asked to volunteer have a number of
associated risks:
Body Composition
The risks associated with the DEXA are very low.  The maximum radiation dose you will receive in this
study is less than 1/1000th of the federal and state occupational whole body dose limit allowed to radiation
workers (5,000 mrem).  Put another way, the maximum dose from any scan we utilize with this DEXA
ranges from 1.2 mrem (Whole body scan) to 12.2 mrem (for several of the regional scans, such as lumbar,
femur, and forearm scans).  The average annual background radiation you already receive is at least 620
mrem/year.  The more radiation you receive over the course of your life, the more the risk increases of
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fatal cancer or inducing changes in genes.  The radiation in this scan is not expected to
significantly increase these risks, but the exact increase in such risks is not known.  There are no
discomforts associated with this procedure. Women who are or could be pregnant should receive no
unnecessary radiation and should not participate in this study.
Women will complete a pregnancy test before participating in a DEXA scan.

There is a very small chance of an irregular heartbeat during exercise (< 1% of all subjects).  Other rare
risks of a stress test are heart attack (< 5 in 10,000) and death (<2 in 10,000).  Wearing a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_467636]-clip can sometimes cause dryness in the mouth and mild discomfort. Difficult exercise may make you
feel very tired, light headed and nauseous.  Exhausting exercise will, by [CONTACT_108], make you feel very
tired.  After any exercise your muscles might ache.
ACSM guidelines pertinent to the requirement of physician supervised exercise (stress) testing will be
followed.
Blood Collection
When the needle goes into a vein, it may hurt for a short period of time (a few seconds).  Also there may
be minor discomfort of having the needle/plastic tube taped to your arm.  In about 1 in 10 cases, a small
amount of bleeding will occur under the skin that will cause a bruise.  The risk of forming a blood clot in the
vein is about 1 in 100, and the risk of significant blood loss is 1 in 1,000.  Additionally, there is a risk that
you may faint while having blood collected or having the catheter inserted in your vein.
Only trained research personnel will be permitted to perform phlebotomy.

US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Regulations define a subject at risk as follows: "...any
individual who may be exposed to the possibility of injury, including physical, psychological, or social injury,
as a consequence of participation as a subject in any research, development, or related activity which
departs from the application of those accepted methods necessary to meet his needs, or which increases
the ordinary risks of daily life, including the recognized risks inherent in a chosen occupation or field of
service."

•Pain in extremity
In addition, use of Dapagliflozin is also associated with a risk of weight loss (up to 10 lbs over
12 weeks).
 
 
        4    When performing procedures, please include all investigational, non-investigational and non-
invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, blood draws, treadmill tests).
Subjects are provided with the following information pertaining to risks:
Body Composition
The risks associated with the DEXA are very low.  The maximum radiation dose you will receive
in this study is less than 1/1000th of the federal and state occupational whole body dose limit
allowed to radiation workers (5,000 mrem).  Put another way, the maximum dose from any scan
we utilize with this DEXA ranges from 1.2 mrem (Whole body scan) to 12.2 mrem (for several of
the regional scans, such as lumbar, femur, and forearm scans).  The average annual
background radiation you already receive is at least 620 mrem/year.  The more radiation you
receive over the course of your life, the more the risk increases of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fatal cancer or
inducing changes in genes.  The radiation in this scan is not expected to significantly increase
these risks, but the exact increase in such risks is not known.  There are no discomforts
associated with this procedure. Women who are or could be pregnant should receive no
unnecessary radiation and should not participate in this study.
Exercise Tests
There is a very small chance of an irregular heartbeat during exercise (< 1% of all subjects).
Other rare risks of a stress test are heart attack (< 5 in 10,000) and death (<2 in 10,000).
Wearing a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_438847]-clip can sometimes cause dryness in the mouth and mild
discomfort. Difficult exercise may make you feel very tired, light headed and nauseous.
Exhausting exercise will, by [CONTACT_108], make you feel very tired.  After any exercise your
muscles might ache.
Blood Collection
When the needle goes into a vein, it may hurt for a short period of time (a few seconds).  Also
there may be minor discomfort of having the needle/plastic tube taped to your arm.  In about 1
in 10 cases, a small amount of bleeding will occur under the skin that will cause a bruise.  The
risk of forming a blood clot in the vein is about 1 in 100, and the risk of significant blood loss is 1
in 1,000.  Additionally, there is a risk that you may faint while having blood collected or having
the catheter inserted in your vein.
Resting Metabolic Rate
The risks associated with this measurement are very low.  Some people might feel
claustrophobic (fear of small places) when the bubble is placed over their head.  The bubble is
clear (see-through) and ventilated (room air is pumped through it).  The bubble is also very,
very light and easy to remove.

03/22/2019 PROTOCOL EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_467640] (pre -counselling) differences between placebo and SGLT2 inhibition groups  
were compared using independent Student t-Tests. Consistent with the experimental  design  
(randomized, double -blind, parallel, repeated measures) the influence of SGLT2 inhibition on the  
physiological responses to dietary counselling was examined using two -way (group: placebo vs.  
SGLT2 inhibition x time: before vs. after dietary counselling) analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
The influence of SGLT2 inhibition and dietary counselling on the dynamic responses to oral  
glucose ingestion were examined using three -way ANOVA (placebo vs. SGLT2 inhibition x  
before vs. after dietary counselling x time points during the OGTT). Pairwise multiple  
comparison procedures were performed using the Holm -Sidak Method. Relations of interest 
were described using Pearson product -moment correlations. The level of statistica l significance 
was set at P<0.05. Data are reported as mean and standard deviation, unless otherwise indicated. 
Calculations were performed using commercially available statistical software (SigmaStat 3.0,

WHY AM I BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH?  
 You are between 18- 65 years, weigh more than you prefer (body mass index is greater 
than or equal to 27.5 kg/m
2), free of diabetes, not pregnant , and not performing more 
than 30 minutes 3 times per week of moderate exercise.  
 
WHO IS DOING THE STUDY?  
 
Drs. Bell and Melby [CONTACT_438848];  local medical doctors, other researchers, and 
a team of trained graduate and undergraduate students are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  [COMPANY_008] Pharmaceuticals LP, a company that makes medicine,  is providing financial support for 
the study.   
 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
 
Dapagliflozin  (commercially available as Farxiga; pronounced: far -see-gah) is a 
medicine for treating type [ADDRESS_599358] ances in the blood that are indicative of disease risk (inflammation and oxidative 
stress). It is unclear as to whether these health benefits are due to Dapagliflozin  per se, 
weight loss , or a combination of the two.  The purpose of the study is to determi ne if: 1.  
Dapagliflozin provides additional health benefits to dietary counseling for weight loss?  2. Use of Dapagliflozin with a calorie- restricted diet can maintain normal control of 
hunger and appetite.   
 
WHERE IS THE STUDY GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND HOW  LONG WILL IT LAST?  
 
The study will take place in the Human Performance Clinical Research Laboratory 
(HPCRL) in the Department of Health and Exercise Science and in the Nutrition

Nutrition, on the main campus of Colorado State University (CSU), Fort Collins . 
 
The study will take place over approximately 2 years. You will be involved for 
approximately 4 months and will be asked to visit the labs  1-2 times per week over 14 
weeks . 
 
WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO?  
 
Here is a brief summary of what you will be asked to do: 
 
Visit 1: in the HPCRL , you will undergo screening: medical history,  blood sampling, 
measurement of body composition, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood 
pressure assessment at rest and during incremental exercise to volitional exhaustion.  If 
your screening visits indicate that you qualify for the study, you will be eligible for 
enrollment.  
 
Visit 2: in the HPCRL , your resting metabolic rate (RMR)  and blood pressure will be 
measured,  and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed. 
 
Visit 3: in the HPCRL appetite and hunger will be assessed in response to a test meal . 
Afterward, y ou will be given a form in which you will record the amounts of food and 
beverage you eat and drink for three days (two weekday s and one weekend day).  You 
will return this completed food record to the research team.  This information will be 
useful for the nutrition counselor to understand your current eating habits and to provide nutritional recommendations.  
 
Visits 4-27: D uring the 12 weeks of treatment you will swallow, on a daily basis, either 
Dapagliflozin  or placebo. During that time, you will be assigned to a nutrition counselor 
with whom you will meet 1-2 times per week for weigh- ins and to discuss strategies to 
achieve weight loss  goals  of approximately one pound per week (10- 12 pounds at the 
end of 12 weeks) . You will need to fast for [ADDRESS_599360] during the morning hours. During these nutrition counseling sessions , you will be asked to participate in a variety of educational activities 
to help meet your assigned weight loss goal, such as how to accurately determine food 
portion sizes.  
 
Visit 28: in the HPCRL , your resting metabolic rate (RMR) and blood pressure will be 
measured, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed.  This visit will 
occur in week 12 (e.g. the final week of daily ingestion of Dapagliflozin or placebo). 
 
Visit 29: in the HPCRL , appetite and hunger will be assessed. T his visit will occur in 
week 12 ( during the final week of daily ingestion of Dapagliflozin or placebo). Body 
composition will be measured at this visit or the start of the following week  (week 13).

Here is a detailed description of what you will be asked to do: 
 
Visit 1 – Screening Visit: Medical History / Blood Test / Body Composition 
 The first visit to the HPCRL will be a screening visit. During this visit , we will make sure 
that participation in this study is right for you.  
 This screening visit will include the following procedures:  
 Medical Questionnaire 
You will be asked to answer several pages of questions related to your health, any 
illness you may have or have had, and medications you use or  have used in the past.  
 Blood Pressure  
We will measure your blood pressure using a standard blood pressure cuff (the same as in a doctor's office). Blood pressure will be measured during all of the tests performed in 
the lab with the exception of body composition. There are no known risks associated with this procedure. (Duration: 5 minutes)  
 Pregnancy Test (Women Only)  
Women who are or could be pregnant should not participate in this study. Before the body composition test(s), women will be asked to take a pregnancy test (urine test) to confirm they are not pregnant.    
 
Body Composition 
We will measure how much fat you have in your body using a test called dual energy x -
ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The DEXA test requires you to lie quietly on a padded table 
while a small probe gives off low -level x -rays and sends them over your entire body.  
This test gives very accurate measurements of your body fat and bone mineral density.  We will also measure the circumference of your  waist and hip using a tape measure. 
(Duration: ~ 15 minutes)  
 Blood Test  
During this visit , we will take approximately 20 ml (~1.5 tablespoons)  from you; this is a 
lot less than the amount that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_438843] a person donates blood. Your blood

  CSU#: 17 -7147H  
APPROVED: 3/22/2018* EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_152617]: 3/21/2019 will be tested for various things to make sure you are healthy enough to consume 
Dapagliflozin . Your blood will be taken from veins in your arms or hands using a needle. 
On the advice of the medical monitor  (study phys ician) , you may be asked to have your 
blood tested several more times  during the treatment  period to make sure the study is 
still right for you.   
 
Exercise Stress Test  
You will be asked to perform a vigorous exercise test.  This test will tell us if your heart 
is healthy. You will be asked to walk on a motorized treadmill or ride an exercise cycle 
(cycle ergometer) for approximately 10- 15 minutes. The exercise will become more 
difficult every 2 minutes. While you are walking/riding, we will measure your heart rate 
with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and your blood pressure with a cuff placed around your upper arm. We will also ask you to wear a nose clip (to stop you breathing through 
your nose) and ask you to breathe through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. This will let us measure the gases you breathe. Depending on your age, a physician may supervise the test. If we do not think your heart is healthy , you will be referred to your primary care physician for 
further testing. There is a chance that you may not be allowed to take part in our study. 
(Duration: ~ 60 minutes)  
 The whole visit will last approximately 2 hour s. 
 
Visit 2 – Resting Metabolic Rate Test,  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test , and Blood 
Pressure  
 These tests will take place early in the morning after a 12- hour fast and 24-hour 
abstention from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise. You will be asked to wear a T- shirt.  
 
Resting Metabolic Rate 
We will measure how your metabolism works (how many calories you burn) while you 
are resting. You will rest quietly on a bed for [ADDRESS_599361] a 
clear plastic bubble (hood) over your head, through which you will be able to breath, 
and ask you to continue lying quietly for 45 minutes. (Duration: ~ 60 minutes)  
 
Blood Pressure  
We will measure your blood pressure using a standard blood pressure cuff (the same as 
in a doctor's office). We will do this three times. (Duration: 5 minutes)  
 
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)  
We will then perform the oral glucose tolerance test. You will be asked to drink water 
(300 ml or ~ 10 oz) in approximately 5 minutes. A small amount of sugar (75 g of glucose) will have been added to the water. This will make it taste sweeter and also increase your blood sugar.   
 
After drinking the water you will sit/lie quietly for 2 hours. You will be able to read, watch 
TV, and/or listen to music. We will collect blood from you over the 2 hours. Your blood 
will be analyzed for concentrations of sugar (glucose), insulin (something that helps control blood sugar), and other things that may help control blood sugar. Your blood will

Visit 3 – Appetite and Hunger  Assessment  
 This test will take place early in the morning after a 12- hour fast, and 24-hour abstention 
from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise. You will be asked to wear a T- shirt.  
 We will place a hollow  plastic tube (a venous catheter) into a vein in your arm or hand.  
The tube will remain in your vein for approximately 5 hours. We will sample a very small 
amount of blood periodically throughout the duration of the visit. The total amount of blood sampled will be approximately 100 ml, or 7 tablespoons . 
 You will be given a liquid meal (an Energy Drink) to serve as “an appetizer” before you are given your main meal. One hour later , you will be presented with a buffet style 
presentation of assorted foods and beverages. You will be able to eat as much, or as little, as you like of any or all of the foods and beverages.   
 Throughout the visit (before the liquid meal, and before and after the main meal) you will be asked questions about your hunger and appetit e. 
 Your blood pressure will also be measured periodically throughout the duration of the visit. 
 The whole visit will last approximately 5.5 hours.  
 
Visit 4- 27 – 12 Weeks of  Nutritional Counseling  
 You will be randomly assigned to receive either the medicine Dapagliflozin  or the 
placebo for 12 weeks and you will be given dietary counseling for weight loss. The goal of the counseling is to help you moderately reduce your calorie intake to produce weight loss of about one pound per week.  You will not  know if you are assigned to take 
Dapagliflozin or the placebo:  Condition 1) You will swallow Dapagliflozin  every day . 
 Condition 2) You will swallow a placebo (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_467641]) every day . 
 Regardless of the condition to which you are assigned, you will meet with your nutritional counselor 1-[ADDRESS_599363] 6 weeks you will meet with your study counselor 2 times per week for dietary counseling and measurement of body weight.  During the second 6- week period

for 10 hours prior to the weigh- in. On 2 random counseling occasions between weeks 4 
and 10, you will be asked to recall what you ate during the previous 24 hours. (Duration: 15-30 minutes) .  If you fail to achieve your target body weight (within 2 pounds) on three 
consecutive weighing sessions , you will be  provided with additional counseling and 
instructions to aid in achieving your target body weight.   If you fail to attend a minimum 
of 80% of your appointments you will be removed the study.  
 During the [ADDRESS_599365] 2 weeks 
the dose will be 5 mg/day. For the next 10 weeks , the dose will be 10 mg/day. For a 
description of  Dapagliflozin, see below.  
 If you fail to ingest 90% of your medication (75 of 84 total doses ), you will be removed 
from the study.   
 
Visit 28 – Resting Metabolic Rate Test, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, and Blood 
Pressure  
 You will repeat the procedures described in visit 2. This visit will occur in week 12 (e.g. 
the final week of daily ingestion of Dapagliflozin or placebo). (Duration: ~ 3 hours)  
 
Visit 29 – Appetite and Hunger  Assessment  
 
You will repeat the procedures described in visit 3. You will also undergo measurement 
of body composition (as described in visit 1)  and be asked to complete the 3- day food 
record again, which you will return to the research team . This visit will occur in week 12 
(e.g. the final week of daily ingestion of Dapagliflozin or placebo). (Duration: ~ 5.5 
hours)  
  
WHAT IS DAPAGLIFLOZIN?  
 Dapagliflozin  is a new medicine that is used to treat people who have type 2 diabetes 
(high blood sugar and/or difficulty controlling blood sugar). Dapagliflozin works by 
[CONTACT_438850]’s ability to absorb sugar from food and beverages.  It does this by 
[CONTACT_467659].  The sugar that is not absorbed is removed from the body in urine.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?  
 
It is not possible to identify all potential risks in research procedures, but the researcher(s) have taken reasonable safeguards to minimize any known and potential (but unknown ) risks. The Human Performance Clinical Research Laboratory has 
emergency supplies including a medicine trolley equipped with heart machines and supplemental oxygen. The research team has a great deal of experience with all of the procedures. Some of the procedures for which you are being asked to volunteer have a number of associated risks:  
 
Body Composition  
The risks associated with the DEXA are very low. The maximum radiation dose you will receive in this study is less than 1/1000
th of the federal and state occupational whole 
body dose limit allowed to radiation workers (5,000 mrem). Put another way, the maximum dose from any scan we utilize with this DEXA ranges from 1.2 mrem (Whole body scan) to 12.2 mrem (for several of the regional scans, such as lumbar, femur, and forearm scans). The average annual background radiation you already receive is at least 620 mrem/year. The more radiation you receive over the course of your life, the 
more the risk increases of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fatal cancer or inducing changes in genes. The radiation in this scan is not expected to significantly increase these risks, but the exact 
increase in such risks is not known. There are no discomforts associated with this 
procedure. Women who are or could be pregnant should receive no unnecessary 
radiation and should not participate in this study.  
 
Blood Collection  
When the needle goes into a vein, it may hurt for a short period of time (a few seconds).  Also, there may be minor discomfort of having the needle/plastic tube taped to your 
arm. In about [ADDRESS_599367]  
There is a very small chance of an irregular heartbeat during exercise (< 1% of all subjects). Other rare risks of a stress test are heart attack (< 5 in 10,000) and death (<2 in 10,000). Wearing a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_438847] -clip can sometimes cause dryness in the 
mouth and mild discomfort. Difficult exercise may make you feel very tired, light -headed, 
and nauseous. Exhausting exercise will, by [CONTACT_108], make you feel very tired. After any exercise, your muscles might ache.

APPROVED: 3/22/2018* EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_152617]: 3/21/2019 The risks associated with this measurement are very low. Some people might feel 
claustrophobic (fear of small places) when the bubble is placed over their head. The bubble is clear (see- through) and ventilated (room air is pumped through it). The bubble 
is also very, very light  and easy to remove.   
 
Dapagliflozin  
Adverse reactions in placebo- controlled studies reported in more than 2% but less than 
8.5% of patients treated with Dapagliflozin  include:  
 
• Vaginal ye ast infections including vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal 
discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), or vaginal itching. .  
 
• Stuffy or runny nose and sore throat ( nasopharyngitis ) 
 
• Urinary tract infections  (UTIs) , such as  bladder or kidney infection . 
 
• Low blood pressure (h ypotension ) which may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, 
lightheaded, or weak: this is particularly in persons with impaired kidney function, 
elderly, or persons on certain diuretics. In order to minimize this risk, we are not 
enrolling people who may be increased risk of hypotension.  
 
• Impaired kidney function: this risk is increased in certain populations. In order to 
minimize this risk, we are not enrolling people who may be at increased risk and we are screening your kidney function prior to and during participation.  
 
• Back pain  
 
• Increased urination  
 
• Yeast infection of the skin around the penis . 
 
• Influenza (f lu) 
 
• Nausea (upset stomach)  
 
• An Increase in bad cholesterol  (LDL) 
 
• Constipation 
 
• Discomfort with urination 
 
• Pain in the extremities  
 In a study of 5,936 patients with type 2 diabetes, one patient became ill with diabetic ketoacidosis (a metabolic sickness). If you experience any of the following

change in breathing pattern, and unusual tiredness (fatigue) or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
 In addition, use of Dapagliflozin is also associated with modest weight loss  (up to 10 lbs 
over 12 weeks)  in some people.  
 
ARE THERE ANY BENEFIT S FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
There are no direct benefits in participating; however , you will receive a copy of your 
results and information pertinent to your body composition (i.e. height and weight) and metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. For example, in blood we will measure concentrations of glucose. You will be provided with a copy of your DEXA scan; you may 
wish to have this interpreted by a medically qualified professional. Finally, this study has the potential to identify an additional benefit for people who use Dapagliflozin  to treat 
their type [ADDRESS_599368] TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?
 
 
Your participation in this research is voluntary. If you decide to participate in the study, 
you may withdraw your consent and stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.   
 WHAT WILL IT COST ME TO PARTICIPATE?  
 
Other than transport to and from the campus , your participation should incur no costs.   
 
WHO WILL SEE THE INFORMATION THAT I GIVE?

CAN MY TAKING PART IN THE STUDY END EARLY?  
 
You will be weighed twice per week in the Gifford Building. If you fail to achieve your 
target body weight (within 2 pounds ) on three consecutive weigh- in sessions you will be 
provided with additional counseling and instruction to aid in achieving your target body 
weight. If you fail to ingest 90% of your Dapagliflozin or placebo (75 of 84 total doses ), 
you will be removed from the study. Your participation in the study will end if you become pregnant.  We ask that, in the event that you do become pregnant, you 
immediately notify study staff and stop taking the provided pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. 
 WILL I RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?

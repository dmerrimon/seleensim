Version 9.0, 26 April [ZIP_CODE].0 OBJECTIVES 
Primary Objectives & Hypothesis 
Hypothesis:  Because POLE/POLD1-ultramutated and/or hypermutated/MMR-defective endometrial tumors 
harbor a large number of novel mutations and are heavily infiltrated with TIL, anti-PD1 therapy with 
Pembrolizumab may represent an ideal treatment option for these patients to re-invigorate pre-existing immune 
responses and eliminate residual/recurrent chemotherapy and radiation resistant disease. 
1.1 Primary Objectives: 
1.1.1To assess the antitumor activity (proportion of objective response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria) of 
pembrolizumab with objective tumor response in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic 
endometrial cancer harboring an ultra-mutated or hyper-mutated (MMR gene-defective) 
phenotype identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and comprehensive genomic 
profiling (CGP).
1.1.2To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of pembrolizumab as assessed by [CONTACT_886315], recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma 
1.2 Secondary Objective(s) 
1.2.1To estimate the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
1.3 Exploratory Objective
1.3.1A) To prospectively evaluate and compare the sensitivity/specificity of NGS and comprehensive 
genomic profiling (CGP) to assess MMR gene deficiency/microsatellite instability (MSI) to 
standard PCR-based DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
testing for the identification of patients responsive to pembrolizumab. B) To evaluate the tumor 
mutation burden (TBN) and individual characteristics of somatic mutations identified using 
whole exome sequencing (WES) in ultra and hypermutated patients and their correlations to 
objective response, PFS and OS in pembrolizumab-treated patients. 
1.3.2To explore the composition of immune infiltrates in POLE/POLD1 and MMR defective tumor 
specimens/biopsies from primary and/or metastatic/recurrent sites with selected markers 
including (but not limited) to CD4+,CD8+, FoxP3, CD25, LAG-3, TIM-3, and ICOS and their 
correlations to objective response, PFS and OS in pembrolizumab -treated patients.
1.3.3To systematically evaluate PD-1 and B7-H1 (i.e., PD-1 Ligand) expression in tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cancer cells and explore their correlations with objective 
response, PFS, and OS in pembrolizumab -treated patients with PD-1 and B7-H1 scoring results.

2.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE
2.[ADDRESS_1240176] common gynecologic malignancy with approximately 54,870 new cases and 
10,170 estimated deaths related to the disease in the [LOCATION_002] annually (1). Recently, using a 
comprehensive genetic investigation, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network provided 
compelling evidence that endometrial cancers result from heterogeneous somatic mutations and classified 
endometrial cancers into four categories: 1) polymerase epsilon (POLE)-ultramutated, 2) microsatellite 
instability hypermutated (MMR-defective), 3) copy-number low and 4) copy-number high, serous-like (2). In 
this landmark study, patients harboring POLE-ultramutated (7%) were found to have the best prognosis (Figure 
1 Left panel below and reference #2). After the initial TCGA report, multiple studies from our group as well as 
others have confirmed that despi[INVESTIGATOR_886292], ultra/hyper-mutation is 
correlated with a more favorable prognosis in both Type I and Type II endometrial cancer patients (3-6). 
Unfortunately, however, as recently demonstrated by [CONTACT_886316] (WES) of 243 patients with 
endometrial disease enrolled in GOG86P (Figure 1 below, right panel, ref. # (7) and Douglas Levine MD 
personal communication) over 25% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_886293], which was fatal in the majority of the 
cases, harbored an ultramutated or hypermutated tumor phenotype. Novel, effective treatment options for 
ultramutated and hypermutated recurrent endometrial cancer patients remain therefore desperately needed. 
Figure 1. Molecular stratification of 232 WES endometrial cancer patients (TCGA report, left Panel, ref. #2) vs 243 endometrial 
cancer patients with recurrent disease sequenced using WES  enrolled in GOG 86P (right panel, ref#7). In GOG86P patients with 
ultramutated and hypermutated tumors accounted for 2% and 24% of all recurrences, respectively.

improved outcomes when compared to the others groups it is possible that the large number of somatic 
mutations present in these tumors, similarly to what has recently been demonstrated in melanoma and lung 
cancer patients (8), may render these cancers highly immunogenic for the host due to the large number of 
mutated epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Consistent with this view, POLE mutated and MMR gene defective endometrial cancers are 
characterized by a high rate of infiltration of T lymphocytes (9-11). Moreover, results from our group have 
recently demonstrated that ultramutated endometrial tumors identified using WES, unlike copy-number low and 
copy-number high serous-like tumors, may trigger activation of both the T helper arm and the cytotoxic arms of 
the immune system (12). In this regard, the inability to mount a potent and long lasting antitumor immune 
response against human tumors has often been attributed to the lack of generation of sufficient tumor-specific T 
cell help (13,14). 
Endometrial cancer with a MSI phenotype may occur secondary to different genetic events such as germline 
mutations in one of the MMR genes (as observed in patients with Lynch syndrome) or because of epi[INVESTIGATOR_886294]1 gene. Moreover, another group of tumors with MSI 
phenotype (also referred as “Lynch like” tumors) exist that exhibit loss of expression of 1 or more of the MMR 
genes secondary to somatic mutations. Accordingly, PCR-based MSI and/or IHC testing are currently used in 
the clinic to identify tumors with mismatch repair gene defect. However, both MSI and IHC may have a 10-
15% false negative rate. In addition the sensitivity of MSI testing for the identification of MSH6 mutated 
patients (ie, a mutation more prevalent in hyper-mutated endometrial cancer when compared to colon 
carcinoma) can be as low as 55% (15-17). These data imply that a significant number of endometrial cancer 
patients harboring hyper-mutated tumors potentially eligible to pembrolizumab may be missed using standard 
MSI testing because associated with a positive IHC staining and/or displayed low or no MSI by [CONTACT_886317] (15-17). With the goal to overcome the current limitations in the identification of endometrial 
cancer patients potentially responsive to immunotherapy, in collaboration with FM (Foundation Medicine, 
Inc. Cambridge, MA) we recently developed and validated a novel computational method to assess 
microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutation burden (TMB) using next generation sequencing (NGS) 
data and applied it to a series endometrial carcinoma (EA) patients assayed with comprehensive genomic 
profiling (CGP)(18,19). Briefly, DNA was extracted from 257 FFPE EA clinical specimens and CGP was 
performed on hybridization-captured libraries of 315 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes 
frequently rearranged in cancer. 114 intronic homopolymer repeat loci (10-20bp long in the human reference 
genome) were analyzed for length variability and compi[INVESTIGATOR_886295]. Predictions of MSI-H (High) or MSS (MSI-Stable) and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were validated 
against colorectal and EA in which MSI status was previously determined by [CONTACT_657253] (ie, current 
standards), showing an overall concordance of 97% (65/67). Importantly, NGS and assessment of tumor 
MSI status by [CONTACT_886318] 3 times as many patients who may potentially benefit from 
immunotherapy (i.e., hyper-mutated) compared to genomic alteration in MMR pathway genes alone, 
while simultaneously detecting POLE ultra-mutated and hyper-mutated MMR gene-defective MSI stable 
endometrial cancer patients (18,19). 
Recent data from immune check point inhibitors immunotherapy trials in melanoma patients have 
hypothesized that the mutational burden of the tumor may play a critical role for the identification of patients 
most likely to respond to immunotherapy. Consistent with this view, in these studies the mutational burden was 
higher in melanoma patients experiencing a sustained clinical benefit than in those without a sustained benefit 
(8). In this regard, because only a tiny proportion of predicted neo-epi[INVESTIGATOR_886296] T cell responses, it is likely, that the number of predicted

Version 9.0, [ADDRESS_1240178] the tumor (8). These recent data strongly suggest that the presence of a specific threshold 
of mutations in hyper-mutated endometrial cancer patients may be potentially critical for the identification of 
patients experiencing maximal/sustained clinical benefit to immune check point inhibitors. Consistent with this 
view, as shown in Figure 2 below for the 65 MMR gene defective endometrial carcinoma cases studied in the 
TCGA report, (reference # 2, data downloadable from the TCGA online resource: https://tcga-
data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/), hypermutated tumors varied greatly in the number of total mutations.
Figure 2. Density plots of the MSI hypermutated endometrial carcinoma patients from TCGA (ref. 2). We divided the MSI 
hypermutated original category, composed of n=65 patients in two sub-categories: 1) MSI MMR-defective secondary to MLH1 
promoter methylation without mutations in MMR genes (ie, 52 patients: Panel A) and 2) MSI MMR-defective with at least one 
mutation in one of the 4 MMR genes (ie, 13 patients: Panel B). We found MSI high patients with MMR gene mutations to harbor 
a 2.39 folds higher number of mutations (mean mutation number = 1404 vs 587, respectively) when compared to MSI high 
MLH1 promoter methylated patients.  
Accordingly, to evaluate whether a specific threshold of mutations is necessary to induce a response 
and/or whether in addition to the number, a specific signature [CONTACT_886337] (for example a high 
prevalence of C:G>G:C transversions or enrichment with two separate signatures [TCT
 A] and [TCG
 , i.e., 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_886297] ) is necessary to trigger strong pembrolizumab immune responses, we 
are planning to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) in all patients selected by [CONTACT_886319].
In this regard, because pre-existing immunity is present in a significant subset of endometrial cancer patients 
and because tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are often suppressed by [CONTACT_187284]1/PD-1L axis the use of 
Pembrolizumab may be highly effective in re-invigorating pre-existing immunity in this selected cancer patient 
population. Consistent with this view, compelling evidence indicates that B7 molecules (i.e., B7-1/CD80, B7-
2/CD86, B7-H1/PDL1, B7-H2/L-ICOS, B7-DC, B7-H3 and B7-H4) and their ligands (i.e., CTLA-4, CD28, 
PD-1, ICOS) not only provide crucial positive signals to stimulate and support T-cell activation, but can also 
offer negative signals that control and suppress potentially protective T-cell responses against spontaneously 
arising and virally-induced human tumors (20). Expression of these molecules on the surface of endometrial 
tumor cells, tumor associated macrophages (TAM) and/or DC, may attenuate or abrogate the ability of the 
immune system to successfully eliminate strongly antigenic (i.e., hypermutated and ultramutated) tumors (20). 
Because these negative signals in multiple human solid tumors have been shown to be largely provided by [CONTACT_4002]-1 
or programmed death-1, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory pathways by [CONTACT_886320] 5/5/2023

tumor-specific immunity in POLE/POLD1-ultramutated and/or hypermutated/MMR-defective endometrial 
cancer patients. Consistent with this hypothesis exciting results have recently been reported in the clinical 
setting against multiple human cancers including hypermutated endometrial cancer patients by [CONTACT_886321]-
human antibodies that target the inhibitory receptor PD1 expressed on activated T-cells (21-23). Taken together, 
these studies strongly validate the importance of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway for the treatment of patients 
harboring highly immunogenic tumors such as ultramutated/hypermutated endometrial cancers. Accordingly, in 
this study we are planning to systematically evaluate PD-1 and B7-H1 (i.e., PD-1 Ligand) expression in tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and POLE/POLD1 and MMR defective cancer cells and explore their 
correlations with objective response, PFS, and OS in pembrolizumab-treated patients with PD-1 and B7-H1 
scoring results. We will also explore the composition of immune infiltrates in tumor specimens/biopsies from 
primary and/or metastatic/recurrent sites with selected markers including (but not limited) to CD4+,CD8+, 
FoxP3, CD25, LAG-3, TIM-3, and ICOS and their correlations to objective response, PFS and OS in 
pembrolizumab -treated patients. Finally, we will explore the association with treatment and subject response in 
peripheral blood populations in ultramutated and hypermutated patients before and during pembrolizumab 
treatment, including absolute lymphocyte counts, number of T cells, T-cell subsets, NK cells, and B cells as 
well as their cellular phenotypes by [CONTACT_4133].
2.1.[ADDRESS_1240179] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been 
known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) 
in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells 
and the ratio of CD8+ effector T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis 
and long-term survival in many solid tumors.
The PD-[ADDRESS_1240180] hijacked by [CONTACT_44857].  The 
normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-
modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_108647]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2).  The structure of 
murine PD-1 has been resolved.  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing 
an Ig Variable-type (V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible 
for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif 
(ITSM).  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-[ADDRESS_1240181] from that of CTLA-4 as both molecules regulate an

peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown 
during thymic development on CD4-CD8- (double negative) T-cells as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a 
variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both ligands are type I

Version 9.0, [ADDRESS_1240182] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen-
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in 
peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T-cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor-
specific T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays 
a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic 
intervention.
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa 
isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  KeytrudaTM 
(pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a 
BRAF inhibitor.
2.[ADDRESS_1240183] Population
Because POLE/POLD1-ultra-mutated and/or hyper-mutated/MMR-defective endometrial tumors harbor a large 
number of novel mutations and are heavily infiltrated with TIL, anti-PD1 therapy with Pembrolizumab may 
represent an ideal treatment option for these patients to re-invigorate pre-existing immune responses and 
eliminate residual/recurrent chemotherapy and radiation resistant disease. 
The use of a well validated next generation sequencing (NGS) method (Foundation Medicine, Inc. Cambridge, 
MA)(18,19)(ie, the test is already standardized and performed in CLIA-certified laboratories without need for 
assay development) that allows assessment of tumor mutation burden (TMB) followed by a comprehensive 
genomic profiling analysis (CGP)(18,19) may represent the ideal approach to identify the population of ultra-
mutated (i.e., POLE-mutated MSI stable) and hyper-mutated (i.e., MMR-defective MSI High, MSI low and 
MSI stable) patients most likely to respond to pembrolizumab therapy. Moreover, the use of comprehensive 
whole exome sequencing (WES) in the patient populations selected for pembrolizumab treatment by [CONTACT_886322] a direct correlation of the total number and the characteristics of the individual mutations identified 
in these patients with clinical responses to the immune check point inhibitor.
2.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification 
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of 
single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 
and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels 
were well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK-3475 
showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose 
tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for 
initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 program has shown that a

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/202310
HIC: [PHONE_18349]
Version 9.0, 26 April 2023lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical 
activity.
PK data analysis of MK-3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limited volume of 
distribution, and a long half-life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL-2 release assay) suggested that 
peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides 
scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_1240184] a wide therapeutic 
range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative 
to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure 
margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of 
similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 
5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of 
tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is 
based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in 
melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in 
the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on 
distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that 
the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations 
performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 
weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 
weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as 
associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure 
range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce 
potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at 
treatment facilities and reduce wastage.

Version 9.0, 26 April 2023Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to 
study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects 
should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise 
discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.
In case toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0-[ADDRESS_1240215] infusion, trial treatment should be 
discontinued after consultation with [COMPANY_006].  With investigator, [COMPANY_006] and Sponsor agreement, subjects with a 
laboratory adverse reaction still at Grade 2 after 12 weeks may continue in the trial only if asymptomatic and 
controlled.
4.3 Timing of Dose Administration
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been 
completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart.  Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after 
the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites should make 
every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of 
infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 
minutes: -5 min/+10 min).
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid 
and administration of infusion solution.
4.4 Trial Blinding/Masking
This is an open-label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the treatment 
administered.
4.5 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing 
trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited 
during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should 
discuss any questions regarding this with the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy 
or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.

4.6 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care
4.6.1 Supportive Care Guidelines
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology 
are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration 
of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen 
when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as 
metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment

pembrolizumab. 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need to follow 
the treatment guidance (as outlined below). 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography 
as part of evaluation of the event. 
Pneumonitis: 
oFor Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.
oFor Grade 3-4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer additional anti-
inflammatory measures, as needed.
oAdd prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid 
administration.
Diarrhea/Colitis: 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as 
peritoneal signs and ileus).  
oAll subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear 
fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted 
via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis.
oFor Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids. 
oFor Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_528106].  
oWhen symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 
Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)
oFor T1DM or Grade 3-4 Hyperglycemia
Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade

oFor Grade 3-4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as 
the steroid dose is tapered.
Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism: 
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid 
function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical 
evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.
oGrade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2-4 hypothyroidism):
In hyperthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as initial 
therapy.
In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.
oGrade 3-4 hyperthyroidism 
Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the 
steroid dose is tapered.
Hepatic:
oFor Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to baseline values 
(consider weekly).
Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids
oFor Grade 3-4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours. 
oWhen symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.
Renal Failure or Nephritis:
oFor Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.
oFor Grade 3-4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.
oWhen symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less

potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication 
initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study 
period up to [ADDRESS_1240222]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be 
reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working 
days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and 
report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   
4.7.[ADDRESS_1240223] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the discretion of the 
investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_108668], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or 
other safety reasons.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:
The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent.

Lymph nodes must be <10mm short axis.
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest 
diameters.  No new lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of a new lesion, or at least a 20% 
increase in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions, taking as the 
reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since treatment 
started, and at least 5mm increase.
Stable Disease (SD):  Target lesions do not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.  No 
new lesions.  
All non-target lesions must be assessed using the same technique as baseline.  
Included in the evaluations are the following standard response criteria for non-
target lesions:
Complete Response:  The disappearance of all non-target lesions.
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease:  The persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s).
Progression Disease:  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. 
Objective Response (OR) will be defined as Complete or Partial Response using CR or PR as described by [CONTACT_886328] v1.1 Response Criteria.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will be defined as date from entry to a particular protocol to date of 
reappearance or increasing parameters of disease on imaging (CT scan or MRI) or by [CONTACT_886329], or is censored at date of last disease assessment. 
Overall Survival (OS)  will be defined as observed length of life from entry to a particular protocol to death or, 
for living patients, date of last contact.
Treatment Toxicity: The grade level of the various toxicities will be classified using the Common Toxicity 
Criteria, version 4 (CTC, v.4) guidelines. Acute toxicities will be scored if occurring </= 30 days from 
treatment completion, and chronic if > 30 days. Frequency and duration of treatment interruptions due to the 
treatment toxicity will be assessed.  
8.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
8.1 Personnel responsible for the safety review and its frequency:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol compliance, and 
conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency which must be conducted at a minimum of every 6 
months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the principal

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/202334
HIC: [PHONE_18349]
 investigator with the help of the Remote Monitoring Coordinator will evaluate whether the study should 
continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either the principal investigator, 
the IRB or the Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) have the authority to stop 
or suspend the study or require modifications.
8.2 The risks associated with the current study are deemed moderate for the following reasons: 
1. We do not view the risks associated with pembrolizumab as minimal.
2. Given the now established safety and validity of studies performed using the FDA-approved drug 
pembrolizumab, we do not view the proposed study as high risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of moderate risk, the potential exists for anticipated 
and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with 
certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with the proposed 
study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as 
follows:
8.3 Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alessandro Santin, according to the following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
8.4 Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe 
8.5 Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  Similarly, 
an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_121380] “seriousness” when determining whether reporting to the IRB is 
necessary.

8.7 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the indicated dose). No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of 
pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject should be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated.
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“ results from” ) the overdose of Sponsor's product or vaccine, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. If a dose of 
Sponsor's product or vaccine meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical 
Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports of 
overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours to the Sponsor 
either by [CONTACT_26365]. 
8.8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
This study will utilize the CTC version 4.0 for toxicity and Adverse Event Reporting.  A copy of the CTC

Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory 
seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to pembrolizumab (see following guidance), and 
actions taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the following 
general guideline:
Yes
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of 
pembrolizumab and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response 
to pembrolizumab and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of pembrolizumab or 
dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.
No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than pembrolizumab (e.g., preexisting medical 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has 
no plausible temporal relationship to pembrolizumab administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1240241] dose of study drug).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or 
current Investigator Brochure.

 Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current Investigator Brochure 
(I.B.) or not identified.  This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with 
the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if 
the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.

Examples of non-directive questions include: 
“How have you felt since your last clinical visit?
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 
8.10.[ADDRESS_1240243] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs.  Avoid 
colloquialisms and abbreviations.  All information will be recording using Oncore Clinical Trials 
Management System.
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized 
as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report the information that is 
currently available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up 
information.
b. Deaths
All deaths that occur during the conduct of the research must be reported to the Yale Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_886302] (if possible) to ensure that all over 
site committees are properly informed.  All information will be entered into Oncore Clinical Trials 
Management System and updated appropriately.  Further determination regarding the need to submit to 
the subjects local IRB, Yale University HHRP following IRB Policy 710 for reporting Unanticipated 
Problems Involving Risk to Subjects and [COMPANY_006] Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Drug Safety Committee will be

 reviewed. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be 
reported as the single medical concept.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at 
the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions should be 
reported as medical and surgical history.
A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or 
SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed 
by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886303].
If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event 
responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE.  For example, if a 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], record the heart condition that necessitated 
the by[CONTACT_13664].

e. Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or within [ADDRESS_1240244] dose of study drug, a report should be completed and expeditiously submitted to 
[COMPANY_006] Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. 
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and

 expeditiously reported as an SAE.  Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a 
female subject exposed to pembrolizumab should be reported as an SAE. A negative pregnancy 
outcomes should be reported to [COMPANY_006] as SAE.
f. Post-Study Adverse Events
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior pembrolizumab exposure.
If the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a 
subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should be 
reported as an SAE.

11 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
a. Statistical Analysis Plan
This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study using the optimal flexible two-stage design of Chen et al. (24) to 
evaluate the efficacy of the study regimen through objective tumor response.  There are no treatment 
comparisons involved and no known historical controls available. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/2023
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/202346
HIC: [PHONE_18349]
 The targeted accrual for the first stage of the study will be 12 eligible and evaluable patients but permitted to 
range from 8 to 15 for administrative reasons. The cumulative targeted accrual for the second stage will be 22 
eligible and evaluable patients but permitted to range from 18 to 25 for administrative reasons.
If the true probability of tumor response is 5%, then the study has a 65% average probability of early 
termination and an expected probability of 10% of incorrectly declaring the study regimen interesting. If the 
true probability of tumor response is 25%, then the study has an expected 90% chance of correctly classifying 
the study regimen as being interesting.
11. 0 Justification of Design: 
            This study will employ the optimal flexible two-stage design since it not only minimizes the 
average expected number of patient exposure to inactive regimen, but also allows the actual 
study accrual to slightly deviate from the targeted study accrual in a multi-center trial while 
maintaining the levels of the average type I and II errors.
Study Endpoints
11.1Primary Endpoints
1) Frequency of objective tumor response as assessed by [CONTACT_393].  Subjects who continue 
treatment beyond initial investigator-assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progression will be 
considered to have investigator-assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial 
progression event but may be designated as delayed responses for purposes of determining 
proportion of objective response and counted as responses for two stage designs.
           2) Frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by [CONTACT_3989] v4.
Secondary Endpoints
           1) Duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Translational Science Objectives
1) To prospectively evaluate and compare the sensitivity/specificity of NGS and comprehensive 
genomic profiling (CGP) to assess MMR gene deficiency/microsatellite instability (MSI) to 
standard PCR-based DNA microsatellite instability (MSI) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
testing for the identification of patients responsive to pembrolizumab. B) To evaluate the 
tumor mutation burden (TBN) and individual characteristics of somatic mutations identified 
using whole exome sequencing (WES) in ultra and hypermutated patients and their 
correlations to OR, PFS and OS in pembrolizumab-treated patients. 
2) To explore the composition of immune infiltrates in POLE/POLD1 and MMR defective 
tumor specimens/biopsies from primary and/or metastatic/recurrent sites with selected 
markers including (but not limited to) CD4+,CD8+, FoxP3, CD25, LAG-3, TIM-3, and 
ICOS and their correlations to OR, PFS and OS in pembrolizumab -treated patients.

 3) To systematically evaluate PD-1 and B7-H1 (i.e., PD-1 Ligand) expression in tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cancer cells, and explore their correlations with 
OR, PFS, and OS in pembrolizumab -treated patients with PD-1 and B7-H1 scoring results. 
4) To explore the association with treatment and subject response in peripheral blood 
populations in ultramutated and hypermutated patients before and during pembrolizumab 
treatment, including absolute lymphocyte counts, number of T cells, T-cell subsets, NK cells, 
and B cells as well as their cellular phenotypes by [CONTACT_4133].
Primary Objectives Study Design
Primary Hypothesis and Endpoints
            Primary Hypothesis:
The intent of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the study regimen measured by [CONTACT_886333]. Tumor response is dichotomized as response (i.e., complete or partial response) 
vs. non-response (i.e., stable disease, progressive disease, or indeterminate disease) and is 
assumed to have a Bernoulli distribution with a probability equal to π. Given a sample size, the 
number of tumor responses is binomially distributed with a given sample size and probability 
equal to π.  Statistically, the evaluation of the study regimen efficacy measured by [CONTACT_886334]. 
We will target an accrual of [ADDRESS_1240252] stage of the study, but 
permit the accrual to range from 8 to 15 for administration reasons. If there are more than 0 out 
of 8-13 or 1 out of 14-15 patients responding (complete or partial response) and medical 
judgment indicates, accrual to the second stage of the trial will be initiated. Otherwise, the study 
will be stopped and the treatment will be classified as clinically uninteresting. If the study 
advances to the second stage, then a cumulative accrual of 22 eligible and evaluable patients will 
be targeted, but permitted to range from 18 to 25 for administration reasons. If more than 1 out 
18, or 2 out 19-25 patients respond and medical judgment indicates, then the study regimen will 
be considered worthy for further investigation.
Under the assumed accrual ranges of 8 to 15 (stage 1) and 18 to 25 (cumulatively after stage 2), 
and under the rejection rules associated with these accrual ranges, if the true probability of tumor 
response is 5%, then the study has a 65% average probability of early termination and an average 
10% probability of incorrectly declaring the study regimen interesting; if the true probability of 
tumor response is 25%, then the study has a 90% average chance of correctly classifying the 
study regimen as being interesting.

11.2Definitions of Primary Endpoints and How These Will Be Analyzed
          1) Proportion of objective tumor response as assessed by [CONTACT_393].
2) Frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by [CONTACT_3989] v4 and corresponding 
frequency table will be provided as descriptive statistics.
All patients who receive any therapy will be evaluated for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. 
Only those patients who are deemed "ineligible" or who receive no therapy will be eliminated 
from the analysis. While on occasion, circumstances may prevent the determination of treatment 
efficacy, such patients will be included in the analysis and labeled as "indeterminate." This 
category will be listed and be reflected in the calculation of the proportion responding.
11.3Sample Size and Power Calculations: 
The sample size and power calculations will be based on the optimal flexible two-stage method 
(24). This method assumes that the number of patients responding to the study regimen has 
binomial distribution and the accrual combination for stage 1 and 2 is uniformly distributed.  
                        The minimum and maximum accruals for this study are 8 and 25 eligible and evaluable patients, 
respectively.
Under the assumed accrual ranges of 8 to 15 (stage 1) and 18 to 25 (cumulatively after stage 2), 
and under the rejection rules shown in Table 8 for these accruals, the study has an average power 
of 90.0% at a target alpha=10% significance level to detect the 20% increase in the rate of tumor 
response from the null-hypothesis rate of 5% to a clinically interesting rate of 25% under the 
alternative hypothesis. The study’s true alpha has an average of 9.5% with a 64.9% average 
probability of early termination and average expected sample size of 15.14 subjects under the 
null hypothesis. 
11.4 Study Monitoring of Primary Objectives
        There will be one formal futility interim analysis for treatment efficacy in the study.

 If the study has an accrual of [ADDRESS_1240253] 1 out of 14-15 patients responding (complete or partial response) and medical judgment 
indicates, the study will be stopped and the treatment will be classified as clinically 
uninteresting. Otherwise, accrual to the second stage of the trial will be initiated. As this is a two-
stage multi-institutional phase II protocol, the initial overall review of toxicity is usually 
performed after completion of the first stage of accrual, at which point accrual is generally 
suspended pending formal analysis of response.
Accrual Goal
The projected minimum and maximum accruals for the study are [ADDRESS_1240254] stage 
of the study, and cumulatively 22 eligible and evaluable patients will be targeted in the second 
stage if the study advances. 
Study Duration
1) Patients will receive therapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity intervenes.
            The patient can refuse the study treatment at any time.
          2) All patients will be treated (with completion of all required case report forms) until disease 
progression, initiation of a subsequent cancer treatment or study withdrawal.
Patients will then be followed every three months for the first two years and then every six 
months for the next three years. 
       3) A patient is considered off study therapy when the patient has progressed or died, a non-
protocol drug or therapy (directed at the disease) is initiated, or all study therapy is discontinued. 
Report all treatment received on Cycle Drug Information Forms and adverse events on Adverse 
Events Forms until the patient qualifies as being off study therapy.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 5/5/202350
HIC: [PHONE_18349]
             There are no specific secondary hypotheses regarding secondary objective. The purpose of 
secondary objective is to describe the survival functions for progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS).
Definitions of Secondary Endpoints and How These Will Be Analyzed
Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of 
progression, death, or the date of last contact, whichever occurs first. PFS is censored in patients 
who are alive and have not progressed.
         Overall survival is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of death or the date of 
last contact.  OS is censored in patients who are alive.      
            The PFS and OS survival functions will be visualized using Kaplan-Meier curves, and 
summarized using medians of PFS and OS as well as proportions of PFS and OS at the one-year 
and 3-year follow-up times.
11.7 Exploratory Hypothesis and Endpoints
Dot plots and box plots in conjunction with Spearman’s correlation analysis will be used to 
explore the associations of tumor expressions of PD-L1, PD-1, lymphocyte infiltration and other 
interesting biomarkers (such as CD4+,CD8+, FoxP3, CD25, LAG-3, TIM-3, and ICOS) with the 
ordered RECIST categories of tumor response. Logistic regression will be used to explore 
associations of the same tumor expressions and biomarkers with OR. Cox proportional-hazards 
(PH) regression will be utilized to evaluate the associations of these tumor expressions and 
biomarkers with PFS and OS. 
The above analysis approaches will also be used to evaluate the effects of TBN and individual 
somatic mutations at baseline on RECIST response, OR, PFS, and OS. The effect on PFS and OS 
of TBN and individual somatic mutations that accumulate during treatment will be analyzed 
using either landmark analysis (25) or Cox regression with time-dependent covariates. 
The sensitivity and specificity of NGS and CGP to assess MMR gene deficiency/MSI will be 
assessed using standard contingency-table methods with the gold standard being PCR-based 
DNA MSI-testing. Agreement between methods will also be assessed using Cohen’s Kappa in 
conjunction with McNemar’s test to test for systematic bias in the disagreements that occur.  
The association of peripheral blood populations (absolute lymphocyte counts, number of T cells, 
T-cell subsets, NK cells, and B cells, as well as cellular phenotypes) with treatment and subject 
response will be explored using profile plots versus treatment cycle, in conjunction with 
longitudinal-analysis techniques such as mixed-models analysis or regression with generalized 
estimating equations to accommodate the non-independence among multiple measurements from 
the same subject over time.

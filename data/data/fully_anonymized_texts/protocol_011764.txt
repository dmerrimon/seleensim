Protocol Summary (ERICA)  IRB_00121505 Page 2 of 10  IRB Approval 8/6/[ADDRESS_222850] commonly prescribed analgesics after ambulatory surgery. In 2017, there were 456 deaths from opi[INVESTIGATOR_188782]. Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_188783] 70% of those deaths (wonder.cdc.gov). Multimodal analgesia is a promising alternative to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. It is based on the theory that combining more than one non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_188784]. The three drug classes that have demonstrated analgesic effects capable of reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_188785] (pregabalin, gabapentin), NSAIDS (ibuprofen,celecoxib), and acetaminophen. Although many studies have been performed using these drugs in isolation, surprisingly little information exists about their combined effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965].  The combination of three non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_188786], nausea, constipation, and itching.  Implementation of multi-modal analgesia in an ambulatory setting is challenging for a number of reasons. First, patient compliance with multiple medications and complex dosing schedules is poor. Second, widespread misinformation exists about concurrent dosing of acetaminophen and NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-imflammatory drugs). For example, many patients and health care providers believe that acetaminophen and NSAIDS cannot be taken simultaneously. As a result, the additive analgesic effect of combining these drugs is not achieved.  Finally, some medications used for multimodal analgesia cannot be procured in the ambulatory setting. For example, pregabalin (trade name [CONTACT_188802]) has been used successfully to treat acute pain and reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_188787]. However, because its mechanism of action is similar to that of gabapentin (an older and less expensive drug), insurers are reluctant to approve its use over the expensive alternative. Although gabapentin is a useful analgesic for chronic pain, its delayed onset of activity and unpredictable blood levels after oral administration make it impractical to use in the setting of acute pain. In fact, optimal dosing of gabapentin may require several days or weeks to establish.By [CONTACT_22242], pregabalin has a rapid onset of action with consistent and predictable plasma levels after oral administration.        For this trial, patients in the control group would receive traditional postoperative pain medication consisting of a combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen (trade name [CONTACT_188803]) as needed at 4-6 hour intervals. Patients in the study group would receive the following: 
 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)  IRB_00121505 Page 3 of 10  IRB Approval 8/6/2020  - Three non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454] (acetaminophen,celecoxib, and pregabalin) would be taken concurrently at six hour intervals for a period of 7 days. -These three non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (acetaminophen, celecoxib, and pregabalin ) would be provided in a "blister pack". All scheduled pain medication for a given [ADDRESS_222851] access to oxycodone as a  "rescue medication". The principles of postoperative pain management addressed in this protocol are supported by [CONTACT_188798].  1. Patient compliance with complex medication dosing protocols may be improved using calander and time based "blister packs".[1] 2. Pain control using combined acetaminophen and NSAID is superior to that either drug in isolation.[2] 3. Pregabalin can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_188788].[3]        Purpose and Objectives  The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the combination of three non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] (multimodal analgesia) can significantly reduce or eliminate the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_188789]. A secondary objective would be to present credible data for insurance providers about the opi[INVESTIGATOR_188790]. This data may encourage insurance providers to support payment for short term use of certain analgesics that currently require prior authorization.

Protocol Summary (ERICA)  IRB_00121505 Page 5 of 10  IRB Approval 8/6/2020  Design   Prospective Biomedical Intervention or Experiment Randomized Trial      Study Procedures  Recruitment/Participant Identification Process: In the orthopedic clinic, patients being scheduled for the following surgeries will be considered: Ligament Resection with Tendon Interposition (hand) Ankle Ligament Recontruction (foot/ankle) Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (knee)   Patients without exclusion criteria will be introduced to the pending study protocol. Specifically, they will be told that the study involves postoperative pain management and alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467]. Those patients who express a willingness to participate will be given a copy of the written consent form to review before the scheduled date of surgery.  On the day of surgery, patients who agree to participate will have any further questions answered and may choose to enroll in the study.     Informed Consent: Description of location(s) where consent will be obtained:  University of Utah Orthopedic Center  Description of the consent process(es), including the timing of consent:  Patients will be introduced to the study concept during the orthopedic clinic visit. Those patients who meet study criteria will be given a copy of the study consent to review for at least one week before actually signing the consent on the day of surgery.  Procedures: After written informed consent, patients will be randomized to receive either multi-modal or conventional postoperative pain medication. Each of the three surgical procedures will have a separate randomization sequence. These three randomization sequences will be generated using Research Randomizer (Lancaster, Pennsylvania).

The anticipated reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_188793] 20%. Alpha value was 0.05, Power =80%. Based on these parameters, sample size needed to detect this difference would be [ADDRESS_222855] to enroll 300 patients is based on the intent to study 3 separate surgical procedures. 
 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)  IRB_00121505 Page 9 of 10  IRB Approval 8/6/2020  This would allow 100 patients for each procedure (50 patients for study group/ 50 patients for control group)    Statistical Analysis The multimodal and control groups will be compared with respect to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pain scores and the incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27277]. The primary outcome measure will be the amount and duration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_188794]. Secondary outcome measures will include average pain scores, nausea, itching (scale 0-10). These scores will be recorded twice daily at awakening and retiring.   Data Analysis Demographic Data will be compared using an unpaired "t" test  Single Measures of opi[INVESTIGATOR_188795] "t" test Repeated measures of secondary outcomes such as pain, nausea, itching willbe compared using a repeated measures analysis of variance  (ANOVA)  For all comparisons, a "p-value" of  <0.05 will be considered significant      
 
Protocol Summary (ERICA)  IRB_00121505 Page 10 of 10  IRB Approval 8/6/2020  Statistical Analysis Plan  The sample size was based on an anticipated reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_188796] 20% in the intervention group. With a chosen alpha of .05 and setting power of 80%, the sample size per group was 44 patients (http://ClinCalc.com). To account for possible attrition of patients, the planned study size was 100 patients with a 1:1 balance of intervention and control groups. Demographic and anesthetic agent variables were displayed as mean (±SD) or count (%). Covariate balance between the intervention and control groups after randomization and before intervention was done by [CONTACT_188800] (SMD). The primary outcome measure was pain reported twice daily for [ADDRESS_222856] hoc secondary outcome was daily oxycodone use (number of tablets) for [ADDRESS_222857] a certain proportion of a population falls within a given confidence interval.29 In addition to comparing the cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_188797], analysis was performed to determine the upper tolerance limit to provide sufficient oxycodone tablets without requiring a refill (the opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]) in 90% or 95% of control and intervention patients, respectively. All analyses were performed using the R software language (Version 4.1.0) and the R packages nparLD (Version 2.1) and tolerance (Version 2.0.0). No data were imputed for the control patient who was lost to follow-up. The null hypothesis was rejected for P < .05; 95% CIs were obtained. Some statistics were rounded.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants will participate in group walks via Zoom video meetings twice per week, starting at 15-minute sessions and progressing to 30-minute sessions, where group leaders will lead participants through exercise sessions. Efficacy Evaluations Primary outcome- 6MWT will be used to measure CRF during which individuals will be asked to walk continuously for six minutes on a flat, indoor surface around cones (separated by 100ft). Supplemental CRF measures will also be used. CRF will be calculated using an equation by [CONTACT_104620], A. S., et al. [ADDRESS_115997] circumference at all in-person assessments. We will examine these characteristics to determine if they changed as a result of increasing exercise.

 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 10 of 34  1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) have a life expectancy up to 25 years shorter than individuals in the general population primarily due to elevated levels of chronic physical and medical illnesses (1-4). Premature mortality in this population may be explained by [CONTACT_104621]: high blood pressure, smoking, raised glucose, physical inactivity, obesity, and high cholesterol (5-7), with physical inactivity and smoking being the strongest contributors to this risk (8, 9). Specifically, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF) impacts not only cardiovascular mortality but also all-cause mortality (10-13), including in individuals with SSDs. Thus, physical inactivity contributes to significantly elevated rates of chronic medical diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals with SSDs (1, 5, 6, 14, 15). Further, despi[INVESTIGATOR_104595] [ADDRESS_115999] remained high (16, 17). Indeed, sedentary behavior and poor CRF among individuals with SSDs relative to the general population (13, 18-21) are likely major contributors to the premature mortality in this at-risk population. As a result, the potential benefits of interventions that increase physical activity (PA) in this population are substantial and could have a meaningful impact on public health. Studies examining the effects of exercise on physical and mental health in individuals with SSDs have yielded encouraging results (22-24). Indeed, well-designed multi-component interventions that target exercise and diet, such as the ACHIEVE trial and the In SHAPE program, led to weight-loss and improved fitness in individuals with serious mental illness (25-27). However, these findings are tempered by [CONTACT_104622]-term accessibility and sustainability. Specifically, the In SHAPE program involved individual meetings with a trainer and continued access to a gym, perks that are inaccessible to most individuals with SSDs after study completion (26, 28-33). While a strength of the ACHIEVE trial was housing it in psychiatric rehabilitation settings, not all people with SSDs have access to such programs. In addition, attendance at the intervention sessions waned after the first 6 months of the study, which the authors attributed to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104596] (19) (p. 1601); however, decreasing subject motivation may have also played a role. Prior work has been largely unsuccessful in overcoming the many barriers faced by [CONTACT_104623]. Specifically, exercise participation is hampered by [CONTACT_104624] (e.g. personal trainers), biological factors such as physical health problems, social variables such as loneliness and limited social support, and self-regulatory problems (e.g., forgetting to exercise, being overwhelmed) (34-43). And, most interventions fail to address motivation, a critical factor for initiating and sustaining exercise, particularly for people with SSDs (44). Ironically, even work that has directly targeted motivation in this population (45) observed difficulties in promoting long-term adoption and sustained exercise after the program ends (46). These findings speak to the need for additional strategies to sustain motivation and ensure the effective translation of motivation into action. Thus, interventions aimed at this population should be designed and delivered in ways that address the substantial barriers to exercise, so as to promote the adoption and long-term maintenance of physical activity (47, 48). Given the importance of motivation and translating intentions to actions, our treatment model is rooted in both self-determination theory (SDT) (49, 50) and implementation intentions (i.e., if-then plans) (51). SDT is a prominent theory of motivation which is highly suited for exercise interventions (52). SDT posits that the fulfillment of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, relatedness, and competence facilitates autonomous motivation (i.e. motivation due to one’s own choice rather than as a result of external factors) (50). Autonomous motivation, in turn, is associated with levels of exercise participation in the general population (52, 53) and in people with SSDs (54).  
Targeting Physical Health in Schizophrenia: Physical Activity Can Enhance life (PACE-Life) 
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_116000] the structure if (opportunity/obstacle)-then I will (response) and engender associations that mimic the effects of habits (55). If-then plans create mental links between good opportunities to act and responses that move the person towards their exercise goal (e.g., If I have to go shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] 1-[ADDRESS_116001] to the store!”) or between obstacles to exercise and responses that will be effective in overcoming those obstacles (e.g., “If I am tempted not to exercise, then I remind myself how proud I feel at the end of the session!”). Two separate meta-analyses revealed that if-then plans were highly effective in increasing physical activity [ES = .31 and.38] (56, 57)] and led to sustained behavior change one year (58-61) and two years (62, 63) post-treatment. If-then plans have also demonstrated effectiveness among samples with psychiatric and clinical diagnoses (64) including people with SSDs (65). Importantly, autonomous motivation and if-then plans are known to combine synergistically, and engender better outcomes compared to the use of either strategy on its own (66, 67). In addition to considering motivation and intention translation, we also sought to develop an exercise intervention that involves minimal staff resources, that is free and easy to access, and has the potential for long-term sustainability. Thus, we chose an intervention that requires no equipment or special training, and can be done anywhere: Walking (68, 69). Research has shown that walking leads to improved physical health, well-being, and weight loss (70-73). Furthermore, walking without dietary change has been shown to improve CRF (10, 74, 75), and reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (76), premature death (77), and the rate of cardiovascular disease (78) in the general population. Dose-response analyses have determined that the strongest health benefit accrues within the first [ADDRESS_116002] of increasing PA among sedentary individuals (76). Moreover, given the widely accepted PA recommendations set forth by [CONTACT_25986] (ACSM) (79) and by [CONTACT_104625] (IOPTMH) (42), walking at a moderate-intensity level should be prioritized (See section C.3. for more details). A valuable way to facilitate the initial engagement of exercise and address the barriers of social isolation in individuals with SSDs is through group-based interventions, as they promote social interaction, camaraderie, and social support (36-39, 80). Group-based interventions also impact motivation by [CONTACT_104626] a common goal, thus satisfying relatedness and competence needs and promoting self-efficacy (35). Walking programs in the general population that promote social support also led to greater maintenance of behavior change (81, 82). Therefore, social support (and reduction of loneliness) may play a critical role in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_104597] (35). A critical component of goal setting and attainment is being able to monitor progress, which can be achieved via physical activity tracking devices. Pedometer use leads to an increase in PA – they are considered acceptable and are highly useful for setting PA goals (83-85), which helps to facilitate changes in exercise behavior (86). In fact, pedometers are the most cost-effective means of increasing PA in the general population (87). In a systematic review of 26 studies, pedometer use resulted in significant increases in PA (26.9% over baseline) (70). With recent advances in sensor and Bluetooth technologies, new physical activity monitors have emerged and are currently commercially available (e.g., Fitbit), which also allow the measuring of walking intensity (e.g., through heart rate; See Section C.3.).  
Targeting Physical Health in Schizophrenia: Physical Activity Can Enhance life (PACE-Life) 
 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 12 of 34   The model above illustrates how our proposed intervention, (PACE-Life) will lead to increased exercise and improved outcomes. Specifically, PACE-Life includes five primary components: home-based walking, group-based walking, activity tracking, goal-setting, and if-then plans, four of which impact the SDT basic needs and one of which enhances autonomous motivation. Specifically, homebased walking targets autonomy needs (as individuals can do this independently), group-based walking targets relatedness needs, and activity tracking and goal setting target competence needs. Satisfaction of each of the SDT needs leads to the intermediate target of increased autonomous motivation. PACE-Life subjects also form if-then plans which serve to enhance the impact of autonomous motivation (66, 67) and promote actual exercise behavior (56, 57). Engaging these intermediate targets in turn engenders the proximal outcomes of greater exercise participation (as measured by [CONTACT_104627]/day). Finally, increased exercise should lead to the improved primary outcome of CRF as well as improved secondary outcomes of loneliness, symptoms, resting heart rate, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure. The proposed research is highly innovative in at least three respects. First, the simplicity and practicality of PACE-life is a key innovation. As noted above, most previous interventions for individuals with SSDs required gym equipment (e.g., treadmills) as well as professional supervision to engage in exercise, thus limiting both sustainability and scalability (22-24, 26). The field demands pragmatic interventions that are low in resource costs and can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_104598] (48, 88). Our walking intervention is both cost-effective and highly accessible given that the group-based portion will be implemented in the vicinity of the outpatient clinic and the home-based portion will be completed at locations selected by [CONTACT_1766] (e.g., outdoors on residential streets or indoors at malls during inclement weather). Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided subjects an opportunity to participate in a virtual walking intervention. Though, technological inequities may serve as a barrier to overall feasibility outside of this intervention, providing subjects with technology (e.g., tablets and data plans) has further improved potential feasibility and scalability. Second, the focus on cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF) is novel. Although CRF has long been identified as a significant predictor of health, it has only recently received attention in exercise intervention research among individuals with SSDs. A meta-analysis on the effects of exercise on CRF in individuals with SSDs (12) revealed only 3 published randomized controlled trials that examined this health indicator (32, 89, 90). Vancampfort and colleagues (13) concluded that despi[INVESTIGATOR_104599], 

Targeting Physical Health in Schizophrenia: Physical Activity Can Enhance life (PACE-Life) 
 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 13 of 34  improvements in this domain are possible and may provide a “novel and valid exercise target that could lead to reductions in premature mortality in people with schizophrenia” (p. 456). In addition, we will measure CRF in a cost-effective and feasible manner without the need for expensive equipment, further displaying our commitment to scalability and sustainability. Third, the present research is conceptually innovative in targeting both motivation to exercise, and the effective translation of motivation into action. Previous interventions that focused merely on generating strong intentions to exercise have had little success (91) because the quality of motivation supporting these intentions was not addressed (92). PACE-Life is deliberately designed to engender high-quality (i.e., autonomous) motivation. However, even high-quality motivation may not equip people to deal effectively with problems that are inevitably encountered as they strive to exercise. These problems include failing to get started, becoming derailed by [CONTACT_104628] (e.g., distractions), and copi[INVESTIGATOR_104600] (51). If-then plans are an effective tool for dealing with each of these problems experienced by [CONTACT_104629] (61, 93-95) and synergize the impact of autonomous motivation, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_104601].  [ADDRESS_116003] of three primary phases: manual development, an open trial, and a small-scale RCT (See Table 1; Table [ADDRESS_116004] time based on the COVID-19 pandemic). These three phases will be iterative such that we will obtain and incorporate end-user feedback from clients and clinicians. Feedback from users will inform both the open trial and subsequently, the RCT.

 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 14 of 34  Rationale for clinic-based/home-based rather than a gym-based exercise intervention. We propose to provide PACE-life through a mental health clinic as individuals with SSDs usually have frequent contact [CONTACT_104630]. Furthermore, interventions that don’t require additional equipment or supervision by [CONTACT_104631]. Our rationale for a clinic-based versus a gym-based exercise program is also based upon recommendations for integrated medical care (104) as well as integrated physical activity within mental health services for this population (105). In addition to clinic-based sessions, we will include home-based sessions, which can be completed at any location and time of the subjects’ choosing to improve self-management and facilitate long-term exercise adoption. The term, “home-based,” means only that individuals will be engaging in this component independently and do not need to attend a select location or require additional equipment. We will work with subjects to identify convenient walking routes using websites and apps (e.g. map my walk). Therefore, our intervention will include both clinic-based sessions and instructions for home-based sessions to prioritize feasibility and sustainability. Moreover, given the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve re-designed our study to have feasibility in a virtual format. Subjects can participate in the study from their homes, as we provide them with technology (e.g., tablets and data plans) necessary for participating in virtual exercise sessions. Exercise sessions include dynamic, stationary exercises that model walking movements, to best match movements performed in outdoor walking sessions. These obstacles have provided the research team with an opportunity to learn about the sustainability and scalability of home-based virtual interventions, in addition to clinic-based interventions. Rationale for moderate-intensity walking as exercise modality. Walking is the primary form of exercise in PACE-life given its accessibility and association with meaningful fitness and health outcomes. PACE-life will combine walking groups and Fitbit with heart rate monitoring to encourage moderate-intensity walking in individuals with SSDs. The goal of PACE-life is to facilitate engagement in 150 min/week of moderate- intensity walking spread throughout the week, which is consistent with recommended fitness guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_104632] (79) and by [CONTACT_104633] (42). To achieve this goal, we will employ a stepwise approach of exercise participation to provide individual tailoring and reduce the likelihood of dropouts (103). Specific details and rationale of this approach are discussed below: Overview and rationale of stepwise approach. Stepwise approaches to exercise participation are often recommended for use with sedentary populations to reduce the risk of injury and dropouts (32, 103). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], these interventions will begin at low intensity and low frequency, and as individuals become more physically active, the intensity and frequency increase. This strategy is especially relevant to individuals with SSDs as they are quite sedentary and have little experience with consistent participation in exercise. Furthermore, individuals need to engage in moderate-intensity exercise, defined as exercising within 60-70% of heart rate reserve (HRR), in order to achieve meaningful changes in CRF (103). In sedentary individuals, moderate to high intensity exercise may not be achievable immediately in the first weeks of the program and starting physically deconditioned individuals in a program that is too intense can be physically dangerous and lead to significant dropouts (103, 106). As a result, a step-wise approach that begins at a lower-intensity and increases to moderate intensity is more appropriate and has been successfully implemented in SSDs (32, 89). For the present study, low and moderate intensity exercise will be operationalized by [CONTACT_104634] (103, 106) where Low-intensity Exercise = 50-60% of HRR and Moderate-intensity exercise = 60-70% of HRR. We (Battaglini, PI) demonstrated the potential benefits of a step-wise exercise program in African-American breast cancer survivors that began at a low intensity and later progressed to moderate intensity (107). The results showed a high completion rate (76%) and adherence to walking goals (70%).

 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 16 of 34  • Will be evaluated by [CONTACT_104635], adherence to homebased component of program, Fitbit usage, and dropout rates. 3. Intervention adherence 4. Evaluation of PACE-life. We will evaluate feasibility in two ways. First, we will determine if recruitment procedures yield the target number of subjects in [ADDRESS_116007] attendance to groups, adherence to homebased component of program, Fitbit usage, and dropout rates.  3.1  OUTCOMES The central hypothesis is that an intervention that increases physical activity as measured by [CONTACT_104636] (at the prescribed intensity) and steps/day will result in improved health and lowered risk for premature mortality as evidenced by [CONTACT_104637] (primary outcome), and on a variety of secondary outcomes (e.g. blood pressure). Guided by [CONTACT_104638], this hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: 1. To develop a manual-based walking intervention for individuals with SSDs: PACE-Life. The manual will include guidelines for goal setting and translating intentions into behaviors (i.e., “if-then” plans), instructions for the group-based walking activity and home-based walking activity (which includes Fitbits), and increasing exercise intensity in a step-wise manner.  2. To examine the feasibility of implementing PACE-life at a community mental health clinic, and in a home-based virtual capacity, in a randomized controlled trial of [ADDRESS_116008] of PACE-life on intermediate targets (autonomous motivation and SDT needs), proximal outcomes (minutes spent walking and steps/day), the primary outcome of CRF, and secondary outcomes.  We hypothesize that PACE-life will be associated with:  • Improved proximal and primary outcomes including greater minutes/week spent walking and steps/day and increased CRF at mid-treatment (3 months), post-test (6 months), and one-month follow-up;  • Decreases in secondary outcomes including loneliness, SSD symptoms, resting heart rate, and blood pressure at mid-point, post-test, and one-month follow-up.  • Higher levels of theoretically-relevant, intermediate targets (autonomous motivation and SDT needs) at mid-treatment, post-test, and one-month follow-up.  4 STUDY DESIGN During this phase of the trial, 56 subjects will be assigned to the fitbit only group (control) or the PACE-Life walking group (intervention). The exercise intervention, PACE-Life, will last for 16 weeks and includes both group walks and independent walks (done at a location of the subject's choosing). Subjects will be asked to complete a total of [ADDRESS_116009], and 1-month follow-up.  4.1 INTERVENTION

Goal-setting materials draw upon SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based) principles as well as implementation intentions (i.e., if-then plans) and mental contrasting. Specifically, subjects will be asked to imagine what the best thing would be about walking/exercise more and then identify the biggest barriers. They will then be encouraged to create if-then plans about how to manage barriers to exercising more. This procedure has been extensively examined in social psychology research and has been shown to be successful in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_104605] (93). Goal-setting groups will be audiotaped and subsequently coded for fidelity to the protocol.  4.1.[ADDRESS_116027] number.

Subjects will be provided information about their accounts should they want to look at the data but will be asked not to change any of the settings as we will be using data for tracking steps/day and minutes spent walking. No identifying information will be inputted in the Fitbit.com account for subjects.  4.1.3 Tablets & Data Plans All subjects assigned to the PACE-Life group will be given a tablet labeled with their subject number. If subjcets do not own a smartphone or personal computer, they may use the tablet for syncing their Fitbit devices. . The tablets will also be used to join virtual walking sessions. Subjects will be provided information about their devices but will be asked not to change any of the settings (or download new apps). No identifying information will be inputted in the subjects’ tablet. Additionally, subjects who do not have reliable wifi in their homes, will be given a monthly data plan to ensure proper connectivity throughout the study.  4.2 STUDY PROCEDURES AND MEASUREMENTS 4.2.1 SCREENING VISIT The following measures will be examined at screening:  • Demographics- We will collect information on age, sex, ancestry, education, parent education, smoking, substance use, current medications, duration of outpatient treatment, and diet. • Intelligence- In adherence with our inclusion criteria that subjects must have an IQ greater than 70, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) will be administered. Subjects participating during the COVID-[ADDRESS_116028] (WRAT) will be administered. • Medical History- A licensed physician will complete the Medical History and Physical Exam Form. They will also complete a 10 minute physical to ensure health. Subjects participating during the COVID-19 pandemic will receive medical clearance from a General Practitioner (GP). Medical Clearance forms will be sent to and received from providers through the EPIC system. • Current Physical Activity- In order to ensure that subjects are healthy enough to begin the walking program, subjects will complete the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q). • Diagnosis-The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be utilized to assess symptoms. The MINI is a semi-structured interview that assesses for DSM diagnoses. The MINI will be used to verify that subjects have a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis before they are enrolled in the study. Raters will be trained to conduct the MINI to a gold standard of reliability (i.e., intraclass correlation > .80).  4.2.[ADDRESS_116029], and 1 month follow-up study visits: • Demographics- We will collect information on age, sex, ancestry, education, parent education, smoking, substance use, current medications, duration of outpatient treatment, and diet. • Minutes Spent Walking- We will utilize data recorded from Fitbits to assess minutes spent walking (by [CONTACT_104639].com accounts and loading deidentified data onto study laptops).  
Targeting Physical Health in Schizophrenia: Physical Activity Can Enhance life (PACE-Life) 
 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 20 of 34  • The Short Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), a valid self-report measure, to assess changes in physical activity. The IPAQ Short Form is a four-item scale that assesses frequency and duration of walking, moderate-intensity exercise, vigorous-activity exercise, and sitting. • Steps/day. We will also collect daily step numbers using Fitbit data downloaded onto study laptops from Fitbit.com at group sessions. • Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF)- CRF will be measured using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) during which individuals are asked to walk continuously for six minutes on a flat, indoor surface around cones (separated by 100ft) and the primary outcome is the total distance walked. The 6MWT is recommended for use with sedentary individuals and to evaluate the impact of an exercise intervention. Moreover, the 6MWT has been successfully administered to individuals with SSDs, including those in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. As a result, we plan to utilize the 6MWT as our primary measure of CRF. Supplemental CRF measures will also be used. CRF will be calculated using an equation by [CONTACT_104620], A. S., et al. 1990 (119) that includes recent weight and height for the calculation of BMI, gender, self-reported physical activity level, and age. Finally, participants will complete a Chair-Rise Task, where subjects will sit and stand from a chair for [ADDRESS_116030] with their knees raising to hip-height, to measure CRF. • Self-determination Basic Needs. The self-determination basic needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence will be measured with two scales. The Basic Psychological Need Scale-in General is a self-report measure that assesses general satisfaction with autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Three subscale scores are produced. The Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale (BPNES) is self-report scale that measures the extent to which basic needs are satisfied through exercise. • Symptoms- the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) will be utilized to assess symptoms specifically present in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The PANSS is a semi-structured interview assessing positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology symptoms. Raters will be trained to conduct the PANSS to a gold standard of reliability (i.e., intraclass correlation > .80) • Resting Systolic/Diastolic Blood Pressure and RHR will be assessed following standardized procedures at the STEP clinic. Individuals with SSDs will be placed in a sitting position in a quiet room, with lights dimmed, and will be asked to remain quiet and relaxed with their eyes closed while avoiding movement for approximately [ADDRESS_116031] these measures assessed at their homes, on UNC-CH campus (Fetzer Hall), or at the Wake STEP Clinic in Raleigh, NC. 
Targeting Physical Health in Schizophrenia: Physical Activity Can Enhance life (PACE-Life) 
 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 21 of 34  • Autonomous Motivation- Given the available research indicating that autonomous motivation is related to negative symptoms and subsequent engagement, maintenance, and adoption of exercise in individuals with SSDs, we will measure this construct with The Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2 (BREQ-2).  • Enjoyment of Walking- Given that enjoyment of the walking program can impact adherence to the treatment, we will measure this construct with the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES).  • Planned Behavior- Available research has shown that intentions, self-efficacy, attitudes and norms are correlated to adherence in exercise. All items are derived from established measures of theory of planned behavior variables (e.g., Conner & Sparks, 2015). Responses are all on 7-point scales. The order of items would be randomized.  • Loneliness: The UCLA Loneliness Scale is a brief self-report measure that will be used to assess this construct.  • Weight, BMI, and Waist/hip Circumference- We will measure weight, BMI, and waist/hip circumference at all assessments using the scale and measuring tape located at the STEP clinic.  • Exit Surveys on PACE-life- At the conclusion of the open trial, we will administer a brief questionnaire to the subjects regarding satisfaction and acceptability that will have both forced choice and open-ended questions (End of Study Survey & CSQ-8).  5  STATISTICAL ANALYSES 5.1 DATA ANALYTIC PLAN Feasibility will be defined by [CONTACT_104640] (56 people), frequency of engagement in the intervention by [CONTACT_4317] (group attendance and activity tracking/home-based adherence), and feedback on the intervention from participants. Feedback from participants will be incorporated into modifying the manual for the RCT and/or future interventions. Analyses of intermediate and primary outcomes will primarily be descriptive in nature. We will calculate means, standard deviations, and within-group effect sizes of intermediate targets (SDT needs and autonomous motivation), proximal outcomes, including minutes spent walking, and steps/day, the primary outcome of CRF, and the secondary outcomes including RHR, blood pressure, loneliness, and symptoms. Further, we will calculate the percentage of the sample meeting the threshold for clinically significant changes in our outcomes of 6MWT, steps/day, and minutes spent walking to determine whether these changes are clinically meaningful. Finally, we will explore the relationship between baseline IQ, treatment adherence and outcome improvement so as to determine if cognitive functioning is associated with treatment response.  5.2 POWER ANALYSIS Power was estimated using Optimal Design Software.  Assuming n=56 (28 per group), alpha=05, and the covariate accounted for 50% of variance, the proposed study has reasonable power to detect an effect size of .[ADDRESS_116032] the types of differences detected in pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (ES of .50-1.[ADDRESS_116033], .54-.83 for BP and .52-1.09 for symptoms).

 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_116034] as a measure of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF). Finally, there is risk associated with participating in the walking groups, such as ankle, leg, and back injuries, and cardiovascular distress.  6.[ADDRESS_116035] contain personal information, including the informed consent document, and the document that links study ID number to personal identifying information (necessary due to the longitudinal nature of the open trial and RCT) are kept in locked filing cabinets in locked rooms. Research data will be kept on password-protected drives, and our computer systems are HIPAA compliant. All study staff participate in annual human subject training that includes education about responsibilities to minimize risk that confidentiality may be breached.  To address the potential health risk associated with participation in the walking groups as well as the 6-minute-walk-test, chair-rise task, and 2-minute step test, all subjects will obtain medical clearance from their general practitioner, or have a medical history and physical examination performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jarskog as part of the Screening procedures. [CONTACT_104654] and/or a trained research assistant will also administer the PAR-Q, a widely used questionnaire to assess cardiovascular risk factors in advance of exercise initiation. For any subject who answers “yes” to one or more items on the PAR-Q, [CONTACT_104654] and/or a trained research assistant will contact [CONTACT_104643]. In addition, the research staff will be trained by [CONTACT_104644], Claudio Battaglini, an exercise physiologist, on the 6-minute-walk-test, chair-rise task, and 2-minute step test procedures. Further, if an individual shows any distress during this assessment, she or he will be instructed to stop the assessment and the research staff will contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Battaglini and [CONTACT_104654].  To address the issue of physical injury or cardiovascular distress during the walking groups, the study clinicians will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Battaglini on potential cardiovascular warning signs, and appropriate responses to any reported symptoms. Further, a safety plan for the walking groups will be developed prior to the initiation of the study with Drs. Battaglini and Jarskog, as well as the study clinicians. The walking groups will be conducted on level terrain, to minimize any potential leg, ankle or back injuries. Finally, it should be emphasized that this project is testing the impact of moderate-intensity walking, a less physically demanding and inherently safer activity when compared to other more rigorous activities that could pose greater cardiovascular and joint-related risks.  Should any subject experience any problems during the study, our research team has trained staff that will be able to provide immediate care on-site. Subjects will be referred for additional care to the appropriate

 Protocol Version 1.0 Page 24 of 34  providers on campus, such as Campus Health Services or the UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104606], if necessary. 6.2 NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK DOCUMENTATION Pregnant women will be excluded because pregnancy alters autonomic and immune responsiveness, increase weight gain, and can influence heart rate.  6.3 POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE RESEARCH TO SUBJECTS AND OTHERS The subjects who participate in the walking groups (in the open trial and RCT) may have a significant benefit on their cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], which could have a subsequent impact on their overall physical and mental health. This study will provide currently unavailable information about the potential feasibility and effectiveness of a scalable and accessible exercise intervention for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The risks of the study are minimal and reasonable in light of the knowledge gained.  6.4 CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA Risks regarding confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_104645]. The code and the data will be stored in separate locked files at Davie or Howell Hall on UNC's campus. Similar subject records are scrutinized regularly and our procedure will add an extra level of protection because the research case numbers will be different from subject numbers (random numbers not associated with date of birth) and the code will be unavailable to anyone outside of the research team. Audio recordings of weekly group sessions will be saved on our secure lab server and on OneDrive so that offsite investigators may review and provide feedback to the clinicians conducting the sessions.  Identifiable data will only be shared with the clinicians of subjects in the study with the permission of the subjects (obtained during informed consent). Clinicians will be contact[CONTACT_104646]. As part of the informed consent process, all subjects will provide the name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_104647] a clinician that we may contact [CONTACT_104648] (e.g., physical and/or mental health) during the course of the trial. We will not be sharing any confidential information with anybody outside of these clinicians. Identifiable data will be maintained for [ADDRESS_116036] information will be shredded. Electronic data will be de-identified upon entry, with the exception of the subjects' birth dates for the purposes of calculating their exact age.  [ADDRESS_116037]. Jarskog (Co-I) will function as the Project Medical Officer and will be available on pager and cell phone to all co-investigators to discuss any safety issue that emerges over the course of the study. All adverse events (AEs) occurring during the course of the study will be documented and reported to [CONTACT_104654]. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will also be reported to the IRB and NIMH. The occurrence of AEs will be assessed during the study and the investigators will follow all AEs to the point of satisfactory resolution. An independent physician will serve as Medical Monitor ([CONTACT_104653], from the Department of Psychiatry). AEs will be tracked over the course of the study and will be reported at the midpoint and endpoint of each walking group cohort to the DSC. All SAEs will be reported to the DSC within 24 hours of learning of the event.

 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_116038] appropriate follow-up and/or stabilization. Follow-up will continue until the problem requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104607], is clearly unrelated to study procedures, or results in death. Outcome of SAEs will be periodically reported to NIMH. A summary of the SAEs that occurred during the previous year will be included in the annual progress report to NIMH.  The trial period is defined from the time that the informed consent document is signed until [ADDRESS_116039] study visit. All serious AE’s occurring during the trial period (including death due to any cause) or within [ADDRESS_116040] study visit will be communicated within 1 day of the investigator becoming aware of the event to designated personnel, using the telephone or fax numbers provided in the Study Reference Manual. Any fatal or life-threatening AE’s will be reported immediately, but no longer than 1 day from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event. A causality assessment will be provided for all SAEs. Critical follow-up information on SAEs will be provided as soon as it is available, but no longer than 1 day from the time the investigator became aware of the information. Other essential, but not critical, information may be reported within the following 5 days. An SAE, as defined by [CONTACT_104649]://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/ucm053087.htm), is an adverse event that satisfies any of the following criteria: • Results in death. • Is immediately life-threatening, including potentially life threatening suicidal behavior or suicidal behavior that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. • Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect. • Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples would include allergic bronchospasm that requires treatment in an emergency department, or a seizure that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The causality of SAEs (i.e., their degree of relatedness to study treatment) will be assessed by [CONTACT_473].  7.[ADDRESS_116041] day that the study intervention is administered will be reported within 1 day of the investigator becoming aware of the event. If an autopsy has been performed, results of the autopsy will be obtained and forwarded along with any available toxicology reports.  7.4 PREGNANCY

 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_116042] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. The Adverse Events/Side Affects form will be used for this purpose. All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAE’s. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAE’s. All other outcomes of pregnancy must be reported on the Adverse Events/Side Effects form.  8 RECRUITMENT STRATEGY  Subjects will be recruited from various clinics in  Durham, Carrboro, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Clinics and sites include the UNC Schizophrenia Treatment and Evaluation Program (STEP) clinics in Raleigh and Carrboro, the Outreach and Support Intervention Services (OASIS) program in Chapel Hill, Carolina Behavioral Care, Club Nova, and Threshold.. STEP, in particular, provides services to approximately 435 clients annually; 76% at STEP meet criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). Clients will be approached about the study in a manner similar to what would happen in the real world outside of a research study. Specifically, psychiatrists, clinicians, and nurses will provide information to clients during appointments, groups, and in the clinic waiting area of a potential new exercise group. If the client is interested, then the research assistant will be notified to get in contact [CONTACT_104650]. IRB approved flyers will also be posted at STEP.  We will supplement recruitment at STEP Wake, as needed, with assistance from the North Carolina Psychiatric Research Center (NCPRC) and STEP-Chapel Hill. Jarskog (Co-I) is the research director of the NCPRC. The NCPRC is co-located with the STEP clinic in Raleigh and has dedicated staff and space dedicated to outpatient research. The NCPRC is an outpatient research facility that is integrated into the UNC STEP Clinic of Wake County. The mission of the NCPRC is to study the pathophysiology of and advance treatments for schizophrenia and related disorders. Research conducted at the NCPRC is currently funded by [CONTACT_3718], NIDDK, foundations that support mental health research, and selective collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry. The NCPRC fosters active collaborative research both within and across departments at UNC-Chapel Hill and with other academic institutions. It also serves as a core facility where other investigators at UNC-Chapel Hill can conduct mental health-related research. STEP-Chapel Hill has 944 active clients. Over 75% have a psychotic disorder and approximately 56% are female. Finally, we will recruit individuals who have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_104651] (~300 individuals with SSDs).

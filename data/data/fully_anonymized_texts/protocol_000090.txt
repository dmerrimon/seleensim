1. Why is this study being done? 
 
This study is being done to determine whether soft bifocal contact [CONTACT_13276] (contact [CONTACT_187843][INVESTIGATOR_187841] 40 see up close) slow the progression of 
nearsightedness (difficulty seeing far away) and to see how they work in order to better be able 
to slow the progression of nearsightedness in the future. 
 
2. How many people will take part in this study? 
 
A total of 294 children ages 7-11 are expected to participate.  Two clinical centers – the 
University of Houston College of Optometry and The Ohio State University College of 
Optometry – are each expected to enroll approximately 147 children. 
 
 
3. What will happen if my child takes part in this s t udy? 
 
Your child will be randomly assigned to wear one of three contact [CONTACT_13276]. Neither you nor the 
study team determines which lenses your child will wear; a computer basically flips a coin to 
determine which lenses your child wears. One contact [CONTACT_187844] (a regular 
contact [CONTACT_13293]), one has medium reading power, and one has high reading power. (The lenses 
with reading power are the bifocal contact [CONTACT_13276].) If you or your child were to look at the 
 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_221787] be removed 
nightly, cleaned, and stored in solution.  Your child should never sleep in these lenses. 
 
We will examine your child for a minimum of three years (please see the description of each 
visit below). Measurements include things that are involved in routine eye exams, plus the 
following additional measures. We will measure where light focuses and eye shape throughout 
the back of the eye by [CONTACT_187845]. We will use clinical 
instruments that do not touch the eye to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_187842].  
 
At the first visit and at each annual visit, we will dilate your child’s pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]. When we do that, we 
put drops in each eye. For about four hours, lights will seem brighter than usual and things close 
to the eyes will be blurry. We will give your child sunglasses to help the brightness, and your 
child can remove eye glasses to see clearly up close. 
 
If either birthparent wears glasses or contact [CONTACT_13276], we would like to be given a copy of that 
parent’s spectacle prescription.  If this is not available, and the birthparent can bring the eye 
glasses to the clinic, we can obtain the prescription from a machine that “reads” the eye 
glasses.  If this information cannot be obtained please let us know.  It will not affect your child’s 
participation in the study. 
 
 
4. How long will my child be in the study? 
 
There are at least nine visits over a minimum of three years. Below is a brief description of each 
visit.

If your child has any problems with his/her eyes, you may need to bring him/her to the clinic for 
an unscheduled visit so we can determine if it is safe to continue contact [CONTACT_13279]. 
 
We expect all children will participate in the study for three years, but it is possible the study 
could be stopped early or continue beyond this time period.

. Can my child stop being in the study? 
 
Your child may leave the study at any time. If you or your child decides to stop participating in 
the study, there will be no penalty and neither you nor your child will lose any benefits to which 
you are otherwise entitled. Your decision will not affect your future relationship with the 
University of Houston. 
 
6. What risks, side effects or discomforts can my child expect from being in the study? 
 
The risks are similar to any contact [CONTACT_187846]. Your child may not see as 
clearly with contact [CONTACT_187847] s/he does with eye glasses. Your child may experience red, 
uncomfortable eyes. Although it is very rare, your child could get an eye infection, which could 
lead to permanent vision loss. If your child gets red, uncomfortable eyes, has excessive tearing, 
or experiences vision changes, he or she should remove the contact [CONTACT_13276], and you should call 
the clinic. 
 
We will put drops in your child’s eyes to dilate the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324]. For about four hours, your child will 
notice brighter lights and blurry vision up close. We will provide sunglasses to help with bright 
lights, and your child can remove his or her glasses to see clearly up close. 
 
Below is a list of additional problems that may occur while wearing contact [CONTACT_13276]: 
• Burning, stinging, and or itching of the eyes 
• Less comfort after all day wear 
• A feeling like there is something in the eye 
• Inflammation of the cornea (clear window on the front of the eye) and/or scratch of the 
cornea 
• Swelling of the cornea 
• Small blood vessels growing into the cornea 
• Small defects in the corneal surface (corneal staining) 
• Redness 
• Bumps on the inside of the eye lid (tarsal abnormalities) 
• Inflammation of the inner eye (iritis) 
• Excessive watering, unusual eye secretions, or redness of the eye 
• Blurred vision 
• Rainbows or halos around objects 
• Sensitivity to light 
• Dry Eyes 
  
 
Version 1.[ADDRESS_221790] from being in the study? 
 
Your child may or may not benefit from participating in this study.  The study contact [CONTACT_187848]’s vision while s/he is wearing them, but there is no guarantee that 
this study will help your child.  Your child’s participation might help him/her become less 
nearsighted in the future. 
 
8. What other choices does my child have if he/she does not take part in the study? 
 
You or your child may choose not to participate without penalty or loss of benefits to which you 
are otherwise entitled. If you don’t want your child to participate, you can ask your primary eye 
doctor to prescribe glasses or contact [CONTACT_187849]. 
 
9. Will my child’s study-related information be kept private? 
 
Efforts will be made to keep your child’s study-related information confidential. However, there 
may be circumstances where this information must be released. For example, personal 
information regarding your child’s participation in this study may be disclosed if required by [CONTACT_187850].  
 
Also, your child’s records may be reviewed by [CONTACT_77712]:

a
gencies;

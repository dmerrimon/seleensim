 Lofexidine for Rapid Opi[INVESTIGATOR_828573]  
 
A.  BACKGROUND  
Lofexidine has recently been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. F ood and Drug Administration (F DA) for 
mitigation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_828574] .  O ne potential use of the compound is in situations where rapid 
detoxification (partial or complete)  is desired,  such as impending surgery. Lofexidine (racemic 
mixture  of R-/+ and S-/-enantiomers, dexlofexidine and levlofexidine, respectively) is a full  
alpha -[ADDRESS_1149615]. (1-5) However , lofexidin e is pharmacologically distinct  from o ther 
alpha -2 agonists, such as  clonidine  whose use has previously been described for the treatment 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_5400]  (OWS ). (6-8)  
Concerns about OWS  are major deterrent for patients  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] , often hampering 
success and compliance with opi[INVESTIGATOR_828575]. (9-11) Fortunately, amelioration of 
such negatively experienced signs and symptoms may be accompanied by [CONTACT_828633] . Lofexidine was originally approved  as a pharmacologic agent for  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828576] m and  other countries , including much of the European 
Union, starting  in the 1980s. Studies have demonstrated efficacy in the  amelioration of OWS  
with fewer adverse effects and a better safety profile than clonidine .(12, 13)  Specifically , 
lofexidine has a lower incidence of hypotension than clonidine, making it more suitable for 
the management of OWS  in outpatient settings. (12) Additionally, unique from clonidine, 
lofexidine also binds to 5-HT 1A (i.e. serotonin)  receptors . As serotonin  levels decrease during 
periods of withdrawal from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ,(14) compounds with [ADDRESS_1149616] properties 
was recently shown to decrease withdrawal symptoms in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent mice. (15, 16)   
Hence, activity m ediated through 5 -HT 1A receptors may help explain additional benefit of 
lofexidine for OWS  treatment beyond that of simple alpha -2 agonism.   
In a recently published multicenter  phase III  randomized controlled trial of more than 600 
patients dependent on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], l ofexidine  at doses of  2.16 a nd 2.88  mg/day significantly 
reduce d OWS  versus placeb o.(17) Additionally , lofexidine increased the rate of completing the 
7-day period of ‘abrupt discontinuation’ by 14% and 12%  for the 2.16 and 2.88 mg/day dosing  
groups , respectively . Hence, l ofexidine has the potential to serve a s a withdrawal treatment 
option when non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_828577] s are preferred or required  or when opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641] -assisted 
withdrawal is unavailable .  Additionally, lofexidine may potentially be used to manage 
withdrawal symptom s that occur during induction or maintenance treatment with mixed opi[INVESTIGATOR_828578].   
With increased attention on a widespread national problem  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_828579], recently 
declared a national Public Health Emergency by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, medical practice s in the U.S. are trying to shift towards more  conservative approaches 
to pain management with less reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_828580] -line therapy .  Consistent with this, 
recent guidelines released by [CONTACT_7698] (CDS) endorse 
avoidance of opi[INVESTIGATOR_828581] .(18) However, 
chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_334625] a significant n ational problem. Data from acute pain  and 
postop erative  states suggests that patients taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_828582] , especially at high 
dose s, have poorer outcomes than those not taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] .(19-29) This includes heightened 
risk for immediate postoperative outcomes such as infection, ileus, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_828583] -term complications such as poor wound h ealing and decreased success rates 
following spi[INVESTIGATOR_61680]. (30) Moreover, patients on opi[INVESTIGATOR_828584] 
12/30/2019  
 resources than their opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -naïve counterparts .(19, 21, 31 -35)  Given these findings, a drug that 
facilitates reliable, safe, and rapid detoxification  or partial detox ification  may be particularly 
beneficial for patients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_828585] a planned surgical 
procedure . Patients presenting for elective spi[INVESTIGATOR_828586],(34) and hence, this group may particularly benefit from targeted 
approaches to wean opi[INVESTIGATOR_33046].   
Specific aim s 
Specific Aim 1:  The primary objectiv e is to investigate the effects  of lofexidine  in adults  (N=25)  
undergoing  opi[INVESTIGATOR_164846] .  In this p hase 4 clinical trial, an open label, variable dose  design will 
be used to facilitate opi[INVESTIGATOR_828587] a 1 5-day period .  The primary outcome measure 
of this study is the number of patients who discontinue  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828588] 1 5. 
Specific Aim 2:  Secondary aims include investigati ng the effects of  lofexidine on  the severity of  
OWS , pain intensity, negative affect , and opi[INVESTIGATOR_828589] 1 5-day 
study period.  Secondary outcome measures will include the Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433],  
the Short Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] -Gossop , the numerical pain rating scale, Center for 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7307] -Depression scale , the Pain Catastrophizing scale,  and a composite scale 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506] .  
 Specific Aim 3:  This exploratory aim will investigate the change in heat pain perception 
attributed  to changes in opi[INVESTIGATOR_162225].  Prior to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_828590] 1 5, 
quantitative sensory testing will be conducted using the Computer Aided Sensory Evaluator IV 
(WR Electronics, Stillwater, MN) .  
B.  PROCEDURES AND METHODS   
B.1.  Study Site  
The study will  be conducted at the medical  (e.g., pain clinic, pain rehabilitation center)  and 
surgical  (e.g.,  orthopedic and spi[INVESTIGATOR_828591])  clinics at Mayo Clinic  [COMPANY_002]ster, MN . All 
patients will be recruited from the medical and surgical clinics at Mayo , and all assessments and 
follow -up will be conducted in th e pain clinic and pain rehabilitation center . 
B.2.  Study Design  
B.2.1. Study methodology  
A prospective, open label, single center , variable dose design will be used to investigat e the 
effects of lofexidine  in adults  undergoing  a 15-day taper . The p rimary outcome  will be the  
number of subjects who discontinu e opi[INVESTIGATOR_828592] 1 5.   
B.2.2.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_828593], the baseline opi [INVESTIGATOR_828594] 5% to 50%  based on the 
physician i nvestigators clinical discretion and patient acceptability of the dose reduction.  The 
physician investigators will reassess each patient  for further opi[INVESTIGATOR_46217] s (5% to 50% 
allowed)  in the pain clinic or pain rehabilitation center  on study day s 3, 6, and 9.   On all other 
study days, patients will be contact[CONTACT_828634].    
Prior to initiating the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187469], the physician investigators will contact [CONTACT_828635] -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  During the [ADDRESS_1149617] the 
12/30/2019  
 established long -term prescriber to ensure continuity of care with the provision of ongoing 
prescriptions.  
B.2.3 .  Variable lofexidine dosing      
Upon initiation of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187469], patients will receive  oral lofexidine  0.54 mg 4 times daily (3 
tablets of  0.18 mg 4 times daily) for a total daily dose of 2.16 mg.  The variable dose design 
will allow the lofexidine dose to  be increased  up to 0.72 mg 4 times daily (4 tablets of  0.18 
mg 4 times daily) by [CONTACT_828636].  The  lofexidine dose  
may also be reduced  by [CONTACT_828637] 0.18 mg 4 times daily (1 tablet of 0.18 
mg 4 times daily)  to relieve  adverse effects  attributed to lofexidine .   
On study days 10 through 1 5, equal quantities  of the baseline  lofexidine dose will be  
reduced , and lofexidine will be discontinued on day 1 5.  All patients will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 
24 hours of study completion to assess for any residual or late emerging adverse effects.  
B.2.4.  Heat pain perception    
Prior to opi[INVESTIGATOR_828595] 1 5, quantitative sensory testing will be conducted using the 
automated Computer Aide d Sensory Evaluator IV (CASE IV;  WR Medical Electronics, Stillwater, 
MN) system based on the method of levels.   The CASE IV system delivers a series of short 
duration heat stimuli of variable magnitude interspersed with null stim uli in random order 
through a thermode with surface area of [ADDRESS_1149618] then rates the stimulus intensity on 
an 11 -point rating scale ([ADDRESS_1149619] intense possible pain).  The 
test is completed when either the maximum stimulus has been delivered, or when the subject 
grades the stimulus intensity ≥ 5.  
In total, there are 25 different  magnitudes of heat stimuli, expressed in units termed “just 
noticeable difference” (JND).   The heat stimuli magnitude of each level is comprised of 2 
elements: (1) temperature, and (2) duration of exposure.  The baseline temperature is 34◦C and 
the therma l rise rate is 4◦C/second.  There is an exponential increase in the temperature and the 
thermode reaches 48◦C at level 21 for a duration of 1 second.  For levels 22, 23, and 24, the 
temperature remains at 48◦C for a duration of 1.5, 5, and 10 seconds, resp ectively. The 
maximum heat stimulus is level 25, which is comprised of a temperature of 49◦C for a duration 
of 10 seconds .  Higher temperatures are not used in order to avoid thermal tissue injury.  
The CASE IV software program (WR TestWorks, version 2.0) a djusts the raw sensory data, 
recorded in units of JND, to account for age, sex, height, weight, body surface area, body mass 
index, and body region of testing. (36-38)  Then, a quadratic regression equation is fitted to the 
pain ratings, and the CASE IV software calculates HP 0.5, HP 5, and HP [ADDRESS_1149620] stimul us magnitude necessary to elicit a threshold 
sensation of pain is termed HP 0.5.  The stimulus magnitude necessary to elicit a pain rating of 
5, indicating  intermediately intense pain, is labeled HP 5.  HP 5 -0.5 is named the pain -stimulus 
response slope an d signifies the difference between HP 5 and HP 0.5.   
The testing conditions will be consistent between patients. The anatomical site selected for 
testing (due to ease of accessibility) will be the dorsal surface of the non -dominant hand.  If the 
non-domin ant hand is an anatomical site of pain, then the dominant hand will be used .    
B.2.5 .  Postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]  
12/30/2019  
 For surgical patients, i mmediate preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_828596].  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_828597] 30   (+/- 5 days)  following lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  The preoperative

serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Patients may be excluded for use of other medications 
based on the physician investigator’s and research pharmacy’s discretion.  
B.4.  Sample Size  
The primary aim of this study  is to assess the effects of lofexidine  on opi[INVESTIGATOR_828603] . The 
purpose of this open label study is to decide w hether additional studies using an experimental design  
are warrante d, and to provide preliminary data for designing a larger efficacy trial.  The primary 
outcome will be the number of subjects who discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_828604] 1 5.  We anticipate opi[INVESTIGATOR_828605] 50% to 70%  of patients .  Thus, a sample -size of N=25  will be 
sufficient to assess  whether  additional studies of lofexidine  in this patient population are 
warranted.  
B.5.  Data Collection and Assessments  
B.5.1.  Demographics and clinical characteristics  
12/30/2019  
 Baseline demographic a nd clinical characteristics will be  collected including age, sex, race and  
ethnicity,  marital status, work status, educational status,  pain diagnosis, pain duration,  smoking 
status,  use of non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007],  previous spi[INVESTIGATOR_828606] -spi[INVESTIGATOR_84017] , and indication for current surgery . 
B.5.2.  Determination of morphine equivale nt dose

Pain intensity will be assessed using the 11 -point  numerical pain rating scale (NRS). The 
validity of the N RS has been well established . 
B.5.[ADDRESS_1149621].   The 
Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7307] -Depression scale provides a validated measure of depressive 
symptoms in patients with chronic pain.   The Pain Catastrophizing Scale provides a measure of 
nega tive cognitions and emotions associated with actual or anticipated pain experiences.   
B.5.6 .  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_828610] (0 to 100 VAS) to 3 questions: (1) How much 
do you crave opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]? (2) How often do you think about the next dose? (3) How strong is your 
urge to take more medication than prescribed? This approach  has been used to assess craving 
in patients with chronic pain.  
B.5.7 .  Heat pain perception  
Heat pain perception will be quantified using the Computer Aided S ensory Evaluator IV (WR 
Electronics, Stillwater, MN). This QST device has been validated, and we have used it to 
quantify opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -induced hyperalgesia and to study other pain -related states associated with 
altered heat pain perception.

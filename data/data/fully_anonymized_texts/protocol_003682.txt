us what this study is about, who is being studied, and what it aims to achieve. If you have an NIH
Abstract, paste it here: Click on the orange question mark to the right for more detailed
instructions.
Up to 70% of patients with acute neurologic injury such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH),
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), traumatic brain injury (TBI), subdural hematomas (SDH) and
ischemic stroke have fevers during their intensive care stay. Several studies have demonstrated that
with acute neurologic injury, fever is associated with increased mortality, worse functional outcomes,
and a longer ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779]. Thus, it has become standard of care to immediately and
aggressively treat fever in this population. In addition to treating the etiology of fever, patients will
receive continuous acetaminophen, ice packs, and external cooling to decrease their temperature.
However, current antipyretic therapy is not effective and patients are subjected to the pain of physical
cooling, sedatives, and anti-shivering medications. Acetaminophen only decreases the daily average
temperature by 0.28°C and the peak effect is in the first two hours. Furthermore, external cooling
devices for SAH are associated with increased frequency of tracheostomy, sedative use, and ICU
length of stay. Thus, we must find a better way to establish normothermia.
Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, acts at the hypothalamus. Already FDA approved
in several diseases, bromocriptine is known for its antipyretic effect in neuroleptic malignant syndrome
and paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. In recent case reports, bromocriptine successfully treated
refractory central fever.  There is one published prospective study of giving bromocriptine to severe TBI
patients to prevent central fever. Here, we propose to evaluate the acute antipyretic effects of
bromocriptine in any etiology of fever in this critically-ill population. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_504826], bromocriptine has never been prospectively studied as a more general
antipyretic in the acute setting. If shown to be effective, this medication could prevent the detrimental
outcomes associated with fever and improve antipyretic management in the ICU.

Aim 1. To evaluate the effect of bromocriptine in addition to standard acetaminophen therapy
compared to acetaminophen alone on total body temperature burden above 37°C over 48 hours when
administered within 1 hour of fever >38.3oC in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral
hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural hematomas and ischemic stroke in the neurologic
intensive care unit.
Aim 2. To evaluate the safety of bromocriptine in febrile patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage,
intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural hematomas and ischemic stroke in the
neurocritical care intensive care unit. 
8.4  DESIGN: Briefly describe the study design (e.g., observational, interventional, randomized,

8.5  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  Briefly provide the background and significance of this study
(e.g. why is this study needed) (space limit: one half page):
If this is a first in humans study, please summarize the safety data from the
animal studies. For pediatric drug or device studies, please identify if this is the
first study in pediatric populations.  
Up to 70% of patients with acute neurologic injury have fevers during their intensive care
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779]. Preclinical animal models demonstrate that hyperthermia, through various
mechanisms, causes worsening brain injury. In human studies, fever is an independent predictor of
poor outcome including increased mortality rates, longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], depressed level of
consciousness, and worse functional outcomes. Thus, it has become standard of care to
aggressively control fever in this population but current antipyretic therapy is not very
effective and external cooling subjects patients to the pain of physical cooling, sedatives,
and other medications to prevent shivering. Acetaminophen decreases the daily average
temperature by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] ~0.28°C and its peak effect is within the first two hours then quickly declines.
Furthermore, external cooling devices for SAH are associated with increased sedative use, longer ICU
stays, and a higher frequency of tracheostomy. Bromocriptine is a dopamine D2 receptor agonist which
acts at the hypothalamus. Since it is already FDA-approved for several other indications, there is
extensive clinical experience on its safety and tolerability with maximum dosing of 100mg/day. Its
potential use as a more general antipyretic for all etiologies of fever is suggested by [CONTACT_504860] (NMS), paroxysmal sympathetic
hyperactivity (PSH) and several case reports which demonstrate bromocriptine’s effectiveness in
treating refractory central fever . In a prospective study evaluating bromocriptine’s acute antipyretic
effect in 50 severe TBI patients, the findings suggested that early administration of bromocriptine
could safely prevent center fever.
The dosing for this proposed study, bromocriptine 5mg every 4 hours (30mg daily total), is
modified off of the dosing recommendations for NMS, PSH, and the aforementioned study in TBI.
Examining the literature regarding the dosing for NMS, various doses were trialed and uptitrated to
effect. There were various starting doses from 2mg every [ADDRESS_650004] been reported across different dosages and disease states
from clinical trials, all of these studies in critically-ill patients reported no serious adverse events. In
Parkinson's Disease patients, there seemed to be a cumulative dosing effect on increasing the risk of
valvular heart disease. In a retrospective study evaluating 72 bromocriptine patients and 47 control,
the mean cumlative dose was [ZIP_CODE].7mg +/-[ZIP_CODE].[ADDRESS_650005] of bromocriptine on outcomes in neuro
ICU patients.
8.6  PRELIMINARY STUDIES: Briefly summarize any preliminary studies relevant to your proposed
research (space limit: one half page) :iRIS: IRB Study Application https://iris.ucsf.edu/Study_App.jsp?FORM_MODE=PRINT_HTM...
11 of 45 4/8/21, 11:[ADDRESS_650006] and many questions regarding the use of bromocriptine still remain.
These case reports describe patients with mostly ICH and one with mixed autonomic hyperactivity
disorder who all underwent extensive infectious and noninfectious work ups. Patients were treated with
current antipyretic management; but, they were only responsive to bromocriptine, suggesting an
antipyretic effect in refractory fevers in acute neurologic illnesses. However, bromocriptine was not
administered immediately upon fever diagnosis and not all of the specific dosing regimens were
reported. Then in 2017, an Egyptian group published a prospective randomized control trial (N=50) in
severe TBI patients where bromocriptine was administered upon admission. This trial did not state the
duration of treatment, nor did they define what medications/interventions were in the control therapy
group. They demonstrated that bromocriptine could be safely administered in the acute setting of TBI.
Recently, an abstract was published which retrospectively evaluated eight aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage patients who received bromocriptine and found no significant difference in median time to
fever cessation and length of ICU or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. The abstract does not provide how the comparison
group was chosen, the dosing of bromocriptine, the difference of antibiotic use, and if all patients were
exposed to the same cooling practices amongst many other confounding factors. They do admit that
prospective studies are warranted. With all of this initial data on bromocriptine’s antipyretic effect, still
no study exists which prospectively evaluates this drug’s efficacy in the acute setting for all etiologies
of fever in a heterogeneous population of acute neurologic illness. These cases and studies have
suggested bromocriptine’s efficacy and safety in refractory fevers and in the acute setting. However,
we need a prospective randomized trial which evaluates a standard antipyretic dosing of bromocriptine
and its use not as fever prophylaxis but as immediate fever treatment in SAH, TBI, ICH, SDH and
ischemic stroke. Prior data hints at bromocriptine’s potential to change antipyretic management and
this study is protocoled and powered to investigate just that.

16. 30 Day Follow-up
Subjects or surrogates, family members, friends, medical health professionals taking care of the
patient will be contact[CONTACT_10073] 30 days to complete a modified rankin score. They will be given
the 30 day phone call form which lists the questions they will be asked. This assessment will be
completed by a study team member and will take approximately 15 minutes. The phone script: Hello,
my name [CONTACT_504880] I am calling from UCSF Medical Center or Zuckerberg San Francisco General
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This is a follow up call for [participant name].  Is it possible for me to speak to that person or
[surrogate, family, friend, medical health professional taking care of the patient]? Great. Were you or
[patient name] admitted to [UCSF or ZSFGH] for [SAH, TBI, ICH, or ischemic stroke]? I am calling
about the fever study, bromocriptine for fever, that [you or patient name] took part of.  Is this a
convenient time to talk for about 15 minutes or arrange a time that is better?" 
If the patient remains in an institutional setting at 30 days and is unable to speak on the phone, then
the medical health professionals caring for the patient may be able to answer the quesitons regarding
their functional status as stated in the new consent form. If the patient is in a home setting but is
unable to speak on the phone for any reason, then family, friend or caretaker may also answer
quesitons about their functionality which is stated in the new consent form. Non-English speakers will
be interviewed using the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504835]. 
The 30 day phone call document states that 
"A member of the research team will be contact[CONTACT_504861],
surrogate, friend, family member, or medical health care professional taking care of you in 30 days to
see how you are doing. This phone call will only take approximately 15 minutes and will ask the
following questions to assess how you are doing." Then the document lists the questions being asked.

For the patients previously enrolled and still admitted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504837] [ADDRESS_650013] CLINICAL PRACTICE : To what extent, if any, do the planned research procedures
differ from the care that people would otherwise receive at this institution or the study site if not
being done locally:
Currently standard clinical practice at UCSF Parnassus is giving acetaminophen but dosing and
frequency vary per treating team. Then the use of external cooling blankets or intravascular cooling
device is also variable and depends on the treating team or even bedside nurse. 
At the beginning of this year, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504838] a Fever Management
protocol for Critical Neurological Injury, TBI, and Stroke. To achieve a goal temperature of 37.5°C, the
following will be done: continuous core temperature monitoring with esophageal probe and rectal or
bladder probe. Document temperature q 1 hour and PRN. Acetaminophen will be initiated: 650 mg
PO/FT q 4 hours  ATC. Give PR if unable to give PO/FT.  NTE 4 gm in 24 hrs.  Discontinue any prior
acetaminophen orders. Obtain blood cultures x2, urine and tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_504839] q 48 hours. For
temperature >38.3°C sustained for 2 or more hours: Initiate surface cooling per Critical Care
Department Policy No. 31.0 “Zoll InnerCool STx—External Temperature System”. Call MD for drop in
temperature of more than 1°C every 15 minutes. Then, for fever not adequately managed by [CONTACT_504862] 8 hours the primary service will consult Neurocritical Care for intravascular cooling
catheter placement.
In this study, if a patient has a temperature ≥ 38.3°C, the patients will be randomized to the control
or intervention arm. Control is currently standard of care as the use of surface cooling is based on
provider preference. No other methods for physical cooling (fans, ice packs, cooling blanket,
external/intravascular cooling) or other antipyretics such as NSAIDS or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] >300mg will be
permitted during the 48-hour study period unless the temperature increases to > 40ºC during the
study period or unless required for standard clinical care (e.g. for ischemic stroke patients) . 
8.12  INSTRUMENTS: List all questionnaires, surveys, interview, or focus group guides that will be
used for this study:

8.26  STATISTICAL METHODS: Briefly summarize the methods and types of analyses that will be
performed:
Using data from a prior published study of acetaminophen versus ibuprofen to estimate the standard
deviation of the potential treatment effect, which assumes a standard deviation of 0.5ºC, with [ADDRESS_650018] 80% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_650019]
to be able to randomize 40 patients over an 8-month enrollment period at two institutions.
The primary endpoint of this study is the difference in total temperature burden > 37º C over 48 hours
as captured by [CONTACT_504863]—time curve (AUC) between the control and the
intervention groups. We will calculate the AUC for each patient, derive the mean AUC in each group,
and then compare these means using a paired t-test. We will use Fisher's exact test to compare the
side effect profile between the two groups.

21 of 45 4/8/21, 11:36 AM
90
 If there are multiple participant groups, indicate how many people will be in
each group:
acetaminophen 650mg every 4 hours: N = 45
acetamionphen 650mg every 4 hours and bromocriptine 5mg every 4 hours: N = 45 
A targeted enrollment of 30 subjects per group is planned to account for any patients who are
discontinued or excluded due to the potential risk of instability and unplanned procedures related to
their critical illness. 
10.3  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION: Explain how and why the number of people was chosen. For
multi-site studies, this is referring to the number that will be enrolled across all sites:
Using data from a prior published study of acetaminophen versus ibuprofen to estimate the standard
deviation of the potential treatment effect, which assumes a standard deviation of 0.5ºC, with 20
patients per group (control arm n = 20, intervention arm n = 20), we will have 80% power to detect a
0.[ADDRESS_650022] at procedures, 1 died secondary to withdrawal of care, 1 was
withdrawn from the study (patient was doing well and family did not want to give him more
medications). Thus out of enrolling 25 patients, 9 were not able to reach full analysis. Likely with every
25 patients, 9 patients will not fit primary analysis thus, would increase total enrollment to 90 patients
in order to reach 40 that would fit primary analysis. We will enroll 90 patients over both sites.

10.6  * SPECIAL SUBJECT GROUPS: Check the populations that may be enrolled: (REQUIRED)
Children / Minors
Subjects unable to consent for themselves
Subjects unable to consent for themselves (emergency setting)
Subjects with diminished capacity to consent
Subjects unable to read, speak or understand English
Pregnant women
Fetuses
Neonates
Prisoners
Economically or educationally disadvantaged persons
None of the above
If not already addressed in the Background and Significance questions in the
Research Plan section or elsewhere, explain why it is appropriate to include
the types of subjects checked above in this particular study:
It is appropriate to include patients who cannot consent for themselves or have diminished capacity to
consent due to the nature of their critical illness (e.g. neurologically injured) or the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504844] (e.g. sedating medications) to achieve the aim of understanding the response and safety of
the study intervention on body temperature. It is common for neuro-critically ill patients with fever to
have a condition or therapy-induced situation that renders them unable to consent for themselves.
We do not want to exlclude non-English speaking patients or surrogates. We do not expect a high
number of non-English speaking patients or surrogates.
Describe the additional safeguards that have been included in the study to
protect the rights and welfare of these subjects and minimize coercion or undue
influence:
Here are some examples:
evaluating capacity to consent for individuals who may be decisionally
impaired (specify how)
calibrating payment amounts to be non-coercive for the financially
disadvantaged
conducting more in-depth evaluations of subjects’ understanding of the
study and the voluntary nature of participation
involving advocates in the consent process
More information and other safeguards are described here: Vulnerable
Subject Populations  and Recruiting Staff and Students .
Additional safeguards that will be put in place to protect subjects who are unable to consent for
themselves include the procedure for obtaining consent from a surrogate if the subject is unable to
consent along with informing the subject about their participation in the study when they regain ability
to participate in the consent process. They will be given the option to decline consent at that time.iRIS: IRB Study Application https://iris.ucsf.edu/Study_App.jsp?FORM_MODE=PRINT_HTM...

the ICU room for the informed consent process. Potential subjects will be given as much time as they
need to consider whether to enroll in the study. In the situation when a patient clearly agrees to
participate in the study, but is unable to sign the consent form because of a physical impairment, such
as the temporary inability to use a writing instrument due to limited mobility, device interference (e.g.
arterial line, arm board), localized edema, and or extremity injury, a present family member or ICU
nurse can provide witnessed consent for the patient's signature. All procedures will be done in a
manner that protects the human subject from research risks. 
If it is determined that the patient is unable to participate in the consent process, the research team
member will describe the research protocol to the patient and indicate the intent to obtain surrogate
consent. If there are no indications of resistance or dissent, the research team member will approach
the patient’s surrogate in the ICU and go to a private location proximal to the ICU room for the
informed consent process. Patient surrogates will be given as much time as they need to consider
consent for participation in the study. 
If for any reason, the patient or surrogate decides they initially do not want to participate in the study
but then later would like to participate after the patient becomes febrile, the research team will re-
screen the patient to make sure the patient is still eligible. If the patient is eligibile, they can be
enrolled in the study at that time. Timing of medical intervention will be based off of 1) the washout
period of any antipyretics given prior to enrollment and 2) timing of last body temperature of the
patient ≥  38.3 ºC (must be within 1 hour of study medication administration).

Throughout the different teams on neurology and neurosurgery, the treatment of fever is
different. Patients who would not participate in this study would likely receive acetamionphen at
various doses and dosing intervals and variable use of a cooling blanket versus ice packs. NSAIDs such
as ibuprofen are rarely used in neurosurgery or neurovascular cases given its potential risk of
increasing bleeding. If fevers are correlated with increased intracranial pressures and traumatic brain
injury, very rarely, cooling catheters are placed at ZSFGH.

13.2  AREAS OF RESEARCH: Is this study related to the cognitive impairment, lack of capacity, or
serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions of the research subjects: 
Yes 
13.3  JUSTIFICATION: Explain why use of surrogates is necessary for completion of this study:
It is important to use surrogates to consent for this study as it can be common for critically ill patients
with fever to have a condition or therapy-induced situation that renders them unable to consent for
themselves. It is appropriate to include patients who cannot consent for themselves due to the nature
of their critical illness (e.g. neurologically injured) or the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321274] (e.g. sedating
medications) to achieve the aim of understanding the response of the study intervention on body
temperature and its safety. 
13.4  COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT:  Describe the plans for assessing the decision-making capacity of
prospective subjects:
After the research team member identifies an eligible patient and the patient’s primary service
physician determines approval for participation in the study, the eligible patient’s nurse will be
approached and asked if the patient is able to participate in the informed consent process as evidenced
by [CONTACT_504867], able to answer questions and follow commands. If the patient is unable to participate in
the consent process, the patient's legally authorized decision-maker (surrogate) will be contact[CONTACT_504871]. The surrogate will be informed that there is no direct benefit from participating
in the study. However, information that patients provide may help critical care professionals learn how
to improve patient care related to fever management with the addition of bromocriptine. Informed
consent will be documented by [CONTACT_114252]’s signature [CONTACT_504890]-
Certification of Surrogate Decision Makers for Potential Subject's Participation in University of [LOCATION_004]

 Risks and Benefits
14.1  RESEARCH-RELATED RISKS: Check if your study involves any of these specific research-related
risks to participants that may need to be disclosed in the consent form:
For interventional studies, risk that the regimen may be more harmful or less effective than other
available interventions
Risks associated with radiation exposure for imaging studies specifically for research purposes
Risks associated with the administration of contrast agent for imaging studies
Risks associated with withholding of treatment or discontinuation of current treatment (e.g.,
washout period is required by [CONTACT_4690])
For randomized, placebo-controlled trials, possible temporary or permanent health consequences
from the deprivation of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504848] a sham surgical procedure, the risk that participants may experience
increased morbidity without the possibility of benefit
Risks associated with modification or extension of a surgical procedure primarily for research
purposes (e.g. risks associated with prolonging anesthesia, time in the operating room, etc.)
Risk of pain or physical discomfort caused by [CONTACT_174968][INVESTIGATOR_1102] (stress, embarassment, trauma)
* For any boxes checked above, describe how you will minimize these risks and
discomforts, e.g., adding or increasing the frequency of monitoring, additional
screening to identify and exclude people with diminished kidney or liver
function, or modification of procedures such as changing imaging studies to
avoid giving contrast agent to people who are more likely to suffer side effects
from it, etc.: (REQUIRED)
There are side effects associated with bromocriptine. There is already extensive clinical trial data from
its various other indications and case reports in the literature documenting its side effects and safety
parameters. Already, through the exclusion criteria, patients that are not good candidates for either
medication, acetaminophen and bromocriptine, will not be included in the study such as a past medical
history of cirrhosis or a current diagnosis of acute liver failure or diminished kidney function. From the
package insert, bromocriptine has different side effects in patients with different indications
(hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, Parkinson's disease). In pregnant patients, it is category B, thus
pregnant women and lactating women will be excluded from the study. 
Per the package insert for hyperprolactinemia, "Therapy was discontinued in approximately 5% of
patients because of adverse effects... nausea (49%), headache (19%), dizziness (17%), fatigue (7%),
lightheadedness (5%), vomiting (5%), abdominal cramps (4%), nasal congestion (3%), constipation
(3%), diarrhea (3%) and drowsiness (3%)."iRIS: IRB Study Application https://iris.ucsf.edu/Study_App.jsp?FORM_MODE=PRINT_HTM...
33 of 45 4/8/21, 11:36 AM
Per the package insert for acromegaly, "nausea (18%), constipation (14%), postural/orthostatic
hypotension (6%), anorexia (4%), dry mouth/nasal stuffiness (4%), indigestion/dyspepsia (4%),
digital vasospasm (3%), drowsiness/tiredness (3%) and vomiting (2%). Less frequent adverse
reactions (less than 2%) were: gastrointestinal bleeding, dizziness, exacerbation of Raynaud’s
syndrome, headache and syncope. Rarely (less than 1%) hair loss, alcohol potentiation, faintness,
lightheadedness, arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia, decreased sleep requirement, visual
hallucinations, lassitude, shortness of breath, bradycardia, vertigo, paresthesia, sluggishness,
vasovagal attack, delusional psychosis, paranoia, insomnia, heavy headedness, reduced tolerance to
cold, tingling of ears, facial pallor and muscle cramps have been reported."
Per the package insert for Parkinson's disease, "In clinical trials in which Parlodel was administered
with concomitant reduction in the dose of levodopa/carbidopa, the most common newly appearing
adverse reactions were: nausea, abnormal involuntary movements, hallucinations, confusion, “on-off’’
phenomenon, dizziness, drowsiness, faintness/fainting, vomiting, asthenia, abdominal discomfort,
visual disturbance, ataxia, insomnia, depression, hypotension, shortness of breath, constipation, and
vertigo."
The effect of liver or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bromocriptine and its metabolites is
not known and has not been specifically evaluated. As only 6% is eliminated via the kidney, renal
impairment may not have significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of bromocriptine and its
metabolites. Since Parlodel is mainly eliminated by [CONTACT_171339], liver impairment may increase
the plasma levels of bromocriptine, therefore, any patient with cirrhosis or a new diagnosis of liver
failure or liver injury will be excluded in this study. 
The side effects of acetaminophen are skin rash, pancytopenia, hypersensitivity reaction, and hepatic
injury including liver failure. Thus, any patient with cirrhosis or a new diagnosis of liver failure or liver
injury will be excluded in this study. It is recommended that in cases of severe renal impairment
(creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min), longer dosing intervals and a reduced total daily dose is
warranted. Patients with a creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min will also be excluded from the study. 
In order to capture side effects, bed side nurses will do 4 assessments (once every shift) of the patient
specifically looking at common side effects of bromocriptine. Also, the patients will be monitored
closely in the ICU setting for any other vital sign changes. 
If patients have an esophageal, bladder, or rectal temperature probe for any other indication, they will
continue to have these probes.
14.2  RISKS: Describe any anticipated risks and discomforts not listed above:
Patients must have routine bladder, esophageal, or rectal temperature probes. Because of the
difference in temperature data gathering and the different sensitivities between oral versus bladder,
esophageal, and rectal probes, we are not allowing oral temperature data gathering. These invasive
probes may cause discomfort and carry their own risks, but they are also part of routine care in this
patient population. If the patient refuses placement of any of these invasive probes, then they cannot
be in the study. 
14.3  
MINIMIZING RISKS: Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the risks/discomforts to
subjects. Examples include:
designing the study to make use of procedures involving less risk when appropriate

protection of the rights and welfare of participants: These resources typi[INVESTIGATOR_504849] (in terms availability, number, expertise and
experience), funding, space, equipment, and time to devote to study activities. Depending on
the nature of the research study, investigators should consider the proximity or availability of
critical resources that may be essential to the safety and welfare of participants, such as
the proximity of an emergency facility for care of participant injury
availability of psychological support after participation
resources for participant communication, such as language translation services
This study protocol will be funded by [CONTACT_504875]. The research team members are well
versed in HIPAA and informed consent. The data analysts in [CONTACT_504891]'s lab, who will be blinded to

diagnostic studies and treatments can be initiated immediately. 
14.5  * BENEFITS: (REQUIRED) Note: These are the benefits that the IRB will consider during their
review. They are not necessarily appropriate to include in the consent form.
Possible immediate and/or direct benefits to participants and society at
large (check all that apply):
Positive health outcome (e.g. improvement of condition, relief of pain, increased mobility, etc.)
Closer follow-up than standard care may lead to improved outcomes or patient engagement
Health and lifestyle changes may occur as a result of participation
Knowledge may be gained about their health and health conditions
Feeling of contribution to knowledge in the health or social sciences field
The research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or
alleviation of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children
Other benefit (describe below)
None
14.6  RISK TO BENEFIT RATIO: Explain why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to
anticipated benefits, if any, to the participant or society:
There is no direct benefit to the patient from participating in this study. However, the information that
patients provide may help guide health professionals in improving care of future neurocritical care
patients with fever and may change the overall management of these patients across the country. The
clinical decision-making for implementing fever management interventions and body temperature
thresholds for administration of antipyretic agents is variable in current practice and medical therapy
for fever control is overall ineffective. Currently, giving patients acetaminophen is the standard of care
and then use of external and intravascular cooling is variable. The risks of bromocriptine with our
current knowledge of the medication's side effects appear to be low. When used in the aforementioned
case reports, prospective TBI study, and retrospective SAH abstract where all patientsiRIS: IRB Study Application https://iris.ucsf.edu/Study_App.jsp?FORM_MODE=PRINT_HTM...
35 of 45 4/8/21, 11:36 AM
were neurocritically ill patients, no side effects were noted. This study will help us identify in a
prospective manner the safety profile in this critically ill population. Future benefits to neurocritically ill
patients include the potential development of evidence- based recommendations for use of
bromocriptine to treat fever during critical illness based on this study's findings. Future benefits also
include the potential to identify the etiology of fever (central versus infectious) based off of the
difference of fever response to bromocriptine which could possibly be addressed in future studies.
Future benefits also include decreased used of external and intravascular cooling devices which also
means decreased need for anti-shivering medications and sedation. There is potential for the study
findings to guide use of acetaminophen and bromocriptine in neurocritically ill patients which has
potential impact on health care resource utilization.

1) Protocol  Title  
Remote  Microphone (RM) Technology in Children using Bone Conduction 
Devices:  A comparative study 
 
2) Objectives*  
• Aim 1: To determine the benefits of remote microphone (RM) technology for 
listening  in classroom  noise  in children  using bone conduction hearing  devices . 
• Aim 2: To determine whether RM wireless audio -streaming accessory results in  
improved listening in noise performance compared to RM digital adaptive in 
children  using bone conduction hearing devices. 
 
3) Background*  
The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate objective outcomes in pediatric bone 
conduction hearing device (often termed “BAHA”) users with and without remote microphone (RM) technology. In this study, two remote microphone technologies will be evaluated  to determine  benefit  in speech  understanding in  noise. 
 
Research shows that intervention with hearing devices alone (i.e. hearing aids, cochlear implants, bone conduction devices) does not alleviate the difficulties children with hearing loss encounter in classroom environments. The effects of noise, distance,  and reverberation  make classroom  listening  particularly  
challenging. Specifically, classrooms often have poor acoustics resulting in negative signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) values (the noise is louder than the speaker of interest). 
Individuals with hearing loss require the speech signal to be 4-18 dB louder than the background noise in order to obtain speech recognition scores similar to individuals with normal hearing (Moore, 1997). Children spend 45-60% of classroom time engaged in listening (Rosenberg et. al, 1999); therefore, it is essential that they have consistent access to all speech sounds to ensure no delays in academic performance,  
speech/l anguage development, or social  interaction  skills.  
 
One of the most common methods of reducing these deleterious effects in children with hearing loss is the use of a personal remote microphone (RM) system. A personal RM system consists of a microphone that is worn by [CONTACT_163088] a transmitter that transfers the signal to a receiver that is in the child’s hearing  
device. Studies have demonstrated that RM systems can reduce SNR values, and  
result in improved hearing outcomes (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2289], et. al, 1999; Hawkins, 1984). While this has been shown in conventional amplification (Anderson & Goldstein, 2004) and cochlear implants (Schafer & Thibodeau, 2006; Wolfe et. al, 2009) to date, there are no studies looking at the benefits of RM technology for pedi atric bone  
conduction hearing device users. 
 
In the past several years, remote microphone technology has evolved. Hearing instrument manufacturers have developed and introduced wireless remote microphone accessories in an effort to make RM technology available at a reduced  
cost and increase access.  These RM  devices transmit  the signal on the globally, 
 
 license- free 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical radio band. These RM 
devices are commonly referred to as, “ wireless audio -streaming accessories.” In  
addition, there has been an emergence of the use of digital adaptive radio frequency 
(RF)  transmission  to deliver  the signal from  the transmitter  to the radio  receiver.  
When using digital adaptive RF, the transmission switches throughout the 2.[ADDRESS_189366] not been completed in pediatric  bone conduction hearing device users. 
 
In hearing aid users, it has been suggested that digital adaptive RM sys tems  
outperform wireless audio-streaming accessories in moderate to high levels of competing noise. These differences are likely due to the adaptive increase in  
receiver  gain provided by [CONTACT_163089]- to high- level  noise 
resulting in  poor signal to noise ratios (Wolfe, et. al, 2015). These noise levels, 
resulting in negative SNRs, represent many classroom settings that children spend their majority of time. In addition, the currently published studies used fixed SNRs which may not be sensitive to the differences in RM technologies. This is an important question as most bone conduction hearing devices offer wireless audio- streaming accessory at minimal to no cost. Understanding how these technologies differ in performance will provide an improved understanding of cost benefit of these accessories and lead to better  patient centered and personalized care.  
 
This study will evaluate hearing in noise performance of children with hearing loss using bone conduction hearing device(s) with and without RM technology. The specific aim is to obtain objective data on the benefits of [ADDRESS_189367] of care bone conduction hearing device in children with hearing  loss. We will also make comparisons between  the 2 RM technologies.

Pediatric conductive or mixed hearing loss patients who are between the ages of 5 and 17 years of age and present to the University of Miami Ear Institute hearing rehabilitation  by [CONTACT_163092]. 
 
Speech  perception  in noise performance will be measured  using sentences  presented  
in noise. Performance  will be evaluated  in the following conditions: 
 
1. Bone conduction device (BAHA)  only 
2. Bone conduction device (BAHA)  + Wireless  Audio- Streaming  Accessory  
(using the Mini Microphone 2+, Cochlear Corporation) 
3. BAHA + Digital Adaptive RM System  (using Roger™, Sonova) 
 
Conditions will be randomized  by [CONTACT_1130].  Speech  will be presented  from  the 
front at [ADDRESS_189372] from the center of the cone of the loudspeaker presenting the sentences at 0 degrees azimuth (American  Academy  of Audiology Remote  Microphone Guidelines, 2008). 
 
All test measures  are non- experimental  and commercially  available.  
 
Bone conduction devices will be programmed according to bone conduction thresholds through the device prior to testing.  
 
Normal  hearing controls 
Hearing loss will be simulated in the normal hearing controls using ear plugs. Speech  perception  in noise performance will be measured  using sentences  presented  
in noise. Performance  will be evaluated  in the following conditions: 
 
1. Unaided  
2. U
nilateral  hearing  aid with contralateral  plug. 
 
 3. Unilateral  hearing aid + Digital Adaptive RM System  (using Roger™, 
Sonova) 
4. BAHA with bilateral plugs 
5. BAHA + Wireless  Audio- Streaming  Accessory  (using  the Mini 
Microphone 2+, Cochlear Corporation) 
6. BAHA + Digital Adaptive RM System  (using Roger™, Sonova) 
 
Speech  will be presented  from  the front at  [ADDRESS_189373] from the center of the cone of the loudspeaker presenting 
the sentences at 0 degrees azimuth, then spatially separated from the noise. The noise signal will presented from four loudspeakers located at approximately 30 degrees,  135 degrees, 225 degrees, and 330 degrees. 
 
Unilateral hearing aid and BAHA will be programmed to mild gain appropriate for testing in normal hearing controls.

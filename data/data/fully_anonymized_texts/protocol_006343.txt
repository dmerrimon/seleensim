Version 5.0  2 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  OVERALL STUDY DESIGN:  
Structure:  Prospective, multicenter, bilateral, non -randomized, 
open -label, comparative clinical stud y 
Number of Sites:  Up to 50 sites in the [LOCATION_003]  
Duration:  6 months; however, any subject that undergoes a 
lens repositioning procedure due to IOL 
misalignment, or  
 
 
at 6 months, will be followed through 
1 year postoperatively.  
Administration:  Surgeons will perform routine small -incision, cataract 
surgery and use the JJSV -recommended 
implantation  systems for lens implantation.  
Refractive target outcomes will be emmetropia for 
both eyes.  
Visit Schedule:  Subjects will be bilaterally implanted; the second eye 
is to be implanted within approximately one month 
after the first -eye surgery.   
All subjects will undergo a minimum of 9 visits: 
Preoperative for both eyes; Operative, 1 -day and 
1-week visits for each eye; and 1 -month and 6 -month 
visits for both eyes together.  In addition, a 1 -year 
postoperative visit will be required for subjects who 
undergo a lens repositioning procedure due to IOL 
misalignment at any time during the study, and for 
subjects who report  
 
visual symptoms  
 at 6 months.  
STUDY POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS:  
Condition:  Bilateral cataracts with corneal astigmatism in at 
least 1 eye of approximately 2.00  D to 3.00 D

Version 5.0  5 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  
The purpose of this  post-approval study is to evaluate the rates of botherso me visual 
symptoms for the higher -cylinder Symfony Toric IOLs, Models ZXT300 and ZXT375, 
compared to the lower -cylinder Symfony Toric IOL, Model ZXT150.  The first primary 
endpoint is the rate of bothersome visual symptoms   
 
 
.  The second primary endpoint will be the rate of 
those having a lot of difficulty with an activity due halos, glare or starbursts as measured 
in the PRVSQ.  
Other endpoints are individual visual symptom ratings included in the PRV SQ, rates of 
IOL repositioning procedures (secondary surgical intervention) d ue to IOL misalignment ,  
rates of explants due to visual symptoms, distance visual acuities, mean percent 
reduction in absolute cylinder, mean refractive cylinder, mean refractive cylinder 
compared to the preoperatively -predicted cylinder , mean spherical e quivalent, spherical 
equivalent compared to the preoperatively -predicted spherical equivalent , percent of 
eyes with cylinder and spherical equivalent (MRSE) within 0.50 D and within 1.00 D of 
the preoperatively -predicted spherical equivalent , rates of medical and/or lens findings, 
and rates of other adverse events.  Preoperatively -predic ted values will be based upon 
those generated from the TECNIS Symfony Toric IOL calculator.   
DATA ANALYSIS : 
The key time frame for analysis will be the [ADDRESS_31854] primary endpoint for 
this study will be the rate of bothersome visual symptoms,  
 
.  
The second primary endpoint will be the rate of those having a lot of difficulty with an 
activity due to halos, glare or starbursts as measured in the PRVSQ.   The primary 
endpoint results  will be compared between higher -cylinder toric IOL subjects and lower -
cylinder toric control IOL subjects at the 6 -month visit.  The  frequency, proportion and 
95% Confidence Interval (CI) will be reported for higher -cylinder and lower -cylinder 
control subjects.  This will be done for the  higher -cylinder (ZXT300 and ZXT375) and 
lower -cylinder (ZXT150) groups.  
Descriptive statistics will be used for reporting results.  Visual acuity data will be reported 
by [CONTACT_32475].  For questionnaire items, the frequency and proportion for eac h 
response will be reported.  For refractive data, descriptive statistics will include mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum and also the percent achieving 
absolute values within 0.5 0 D and 1.0 0 D of preoperatively -predicted  values.  

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION , INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 5.0  6 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  The frequency and proportion of primary and fellow eyes with adverse events or 
medical/lens findings will also be reported.   
STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES:  
Inclusion and exclusion qualifications will be assessed at the preoperative visit according 
to the in clusion/exclusion criteria.  The Informed Consent Document and Authorization 
for Use/Disclosure of Health Information form (HIPAA authorization) must be signed by 
[CONTACT_32476] -specific 
procedures.  Each subject will receive Symfony IOLs in both eyes, according to the 
TECNIS Symfony Toric IOL calculator, and will be placed in either the higher -cylinder 
group or the lower -cylinder control group based on the IOL with the highest toric power.  
Key preoperative data include ocular health and history, distance visual acuities, 
manifest refraction, keratometry, biomicroscopic slit -lamp findings, ocular symptoms and 
biometry.  The operative visit will include standard procedures for cataract surgery  and 
IOL implantation.  Key postoperative data collection includes non -directed visual 
symptoms, questionnaires, distance visual acuities, manifest refraction, keratometry, 
slit-lamp findings and adverse events.   
2. BACKGROUND/INTROD UCTION  
Amongst patient s undergoing cataract surgery, approximately 35 -41% of cataract 
patients have ≥ 0.75 diopter of corneal astigmatism, with 15% -20% having ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_31855] surgery (e.g., limbal relaxing incisions, etc.), toric IOLs are 
now commonly used for correction of aphakia and pre -existing ocular astigmatism.   
The TECNIS  Symfony Extended Range of Vision IOLs were designed in response to a 
patient need for lense s that can provide good distance vision, improved intermediate and 
near vision compared to standard monofocal IOLs, and less dysphotopsia compared to a 
multifocal IOL.  The Symfony IOLs utilize diffractive technology to mitigate the effects of 
presby[CONTACT_19555] b y providing an extended depth of focus, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_32461] a 
minimum and reducing chromatic aberration.  In addition, the Symfony Toric IOLs 
include an anterior aspheric optic with a toric surface to correct for ocular astigmatism.   
On July 15, 2016, JJSV received [LOCATION_003] FDA approval (P980040/S065) for the TECNIS 
Symfony Extended Range of Vision IOL, Model ZXR00, and the TECNIS Symfony Toric 
Extended Range of Vision IOLs, Models ZXT150, ZXT225, ZXT300 and ZXT375, for the 
visual correction of aphakia and pre -existing corneal astigmatism of 1 diopter or greater.  
Compared to an aspheric monofocal IOL, the lens provides improved intermediate and 
near visual acuity, while maintaining comparable distance visual acuity.

3. CLINICAL HYPOTHES IS 
The rate of bothersome vis ual symptom items  
 for the 
Symfony Toric IOL higher -cylinder group will be compared to  the rate for the 
lower -cylinder group.  The bothersome visual symptom items of interest are halos, glare, 
and starbursts.  
4. STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a prospective, multicenter, bilateral, non -randomized, open -label, 
comparative, 6 -month clinical study conducted at up to 50 sites in the [LOCATION_003].  Subjects 
who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be bilaterally implanted with Symfony IOLs, 
with either 1) Model ZXT300 or ZXT375 IOLs (higher -cylinder group), or 2) control Model 
ZXT150 (lower -cylinder control group) IOL, implanted in at least one eye, according to 
the TECNIS Symfony Toric IOL calculator.  The fellow eye will be allowed to have any  
Symfony IOL implanted, according to the TECNIS Symfony Toric IOL calculator, 
provided  it is the same or a lower toric power as the primary eye.   The eye with the 
highest toric power IOL will determine the model group.

In order to verif y subject eligibility and to optimize toric IOL selection and axis placement, 
investigators will use the web -based TECNIS Symfony Toric IOL calculator 
(www.TecnisToricCalc.com ) to determine the appropriate IOL model for each eye.  Note 
that the TECNIS Symf ony Toric IOL calculator provides toric IOL options based on 
predicted astigmatism, i.e., the vector sum of pre -existing corneal astigmatism and the 
expected effect of SIA.  For this study, subjects are to have corneal astigmatism in at 
least one eye that,  when taking SIA into account and using  the PCA algorithm, has 
approximately 2.00 D to 3.00 D (higher -cylinder group) or 1.00 D to 1.50 D 
(lower -cylinder group) of corneal astigmatism to be corrected, and subjects must qualify 
for implantation of the suita ble toric IOL by [CONTACT_32489].  
 
 
 
 
Predicted residual refractive cylinder must be ≤0.50 D for all toric 
eyes.  For all subje cts, the IOL model selections chosen by [CONTACT_32490].

Version 5.0  21 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  11.[ADDRESS_31862] will be considered a screen failure.   
 
 
 
 
 
Following lens insertion, Symfony Toric IOLs are to be precisely aligned with the 
intended axis of placement using the imaginary line formed by [CONTACT_32491]/optic junctions of the IOL, identifying the flat meridian of th e optic.  
Special care should be taken to ensure proper positioning of the Symfony Toric IOL at 
the intended axis following viscoelastic removal and/or inflation of the capsular bag at 
the end of the surgical case.  All viscoelastic must be carefully remov ed from the 
capsular bag.  Residual viscoelastic and/or over -inflation of the bag may allow the lens 
to rotate, causing misalignment of the Symfony Toric IOL from the intended axis.    
Operative case report forms will collect the following information:  
 Date of surgery  
 Operative eye  
 IOL model, power and serial number  
 Use of intraoperative wavefront analysis  
 Incision location  
 Surgical complications  
 Other surgical procedures  
 IOL placement (e.g., within capsular bag, proper alignment, etc.)  
 Wound closure (e.g ., suture required)

Any UADE ([LOCATION_003] 21CFR 812.3(s)) or [LOCATION_003]DE (ISO [ZIP_CODE]) is defined as any serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or  any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan (i.e., this protocol), 
application (incl uding a supplementary plan or application), or risk assessment, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
An SAE/ADE form will be completed by [CONTACT_32499].  
12.[ADDRESS_31875] COMPLAI NT/DEVICE DEFICIENCY  DEFINITION  
A product complaint/device deficiency is defined (21 CFR 820.3(b) and ISO [ZIP_CODE]) as 
any alleged deficiency related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness, or performance of a device.  Product complaints can pertain to any 
marketed JJSV  device being used in the study.  The investigator is to assess whether 
the deficiency could have led to a serious adverse event without suitable action or 
intervention or under less fortunate circumstances.

Version 5.0  29 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  12.[ADDRESS_31876], regardless 
of severity and whether or not attributed to the IOLs used in this study, are to be 
reported to JJSV  and recorded on the case report form correspondin g to the visit during 
which awareness of the event occurred.  Adverse events are also to be reported to the 
reviewing IRB as per the IRB’s reporting requirements.  If required, adverse events will 
be reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies (e.g., F DA) according to all applicable 
laws and regulations.   
All serious adverse events, whether anticipated or unanticipated, all adverse device 
effects and all device complaints, deficiencies or malfunctions with or without an adverse 
event, shall be reported  per the [LOCATION_003] Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR812) for sites 
in the [LOCATION_003] as follows:  
Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event that is not serious or device -related is to be reported to JJSV  in a 
timely manner.  Notification of non -serious and non -device re lated adverse events will 
occur by [CONTACT_32500].  Such adverse events are also to be 
reported to the reviewing IRB per their reporting requirements.  
Serious and/or Device -Related Adverse Event Reporting  
SAE’s and/or ADEs are to b e documented using the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Device Effect (SAE/ADE) CRF.  In the event of a n SAE, JJSV  must be notified 
immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection) .  Any SAE /ADE  is to be reported by 
[CONTACT_648], email and/or by [CONTACT_17258] a com pleted SAE/ADE CRF.  Any SAE or device -
related AE should also be reported to the investigator’s IRB per their reporting 
requirements.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) Reporting  
If during the stu dy, a serious adverse event occurs that may reasonably be regarded as 
study -device -related and was not previously expected in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence, the investigator is to report the UADE/[LOCATION_003]DE to JJSV  within 24  hours, and to 
the investi gator’s IRB as soon as possible.  Any UADE or [LOCATION_003]DE is to be reported by 
[CONTACT_648], email and/or submitting a completed SAE/ADE CRF.    
Complaints/Device Deficiency Reporting  
A general product complaint or device deficiency is to be reported to JJSV  in a timely 
manner.  Notification of complaints/device deficiencies will occur by [CONTACT_32501] “Complaint Form” CRF and/or by [CONTACT_32502].  
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION , INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 5.0  30 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  Any device deficiency that could have led to a serious adverse event without suita ble 
action or intervention, or under less fortunate circumstances, must be reported to the 
sponsor immediately (no later than 24 hours after detection ). Device deficiencies that 
could have led to a serious adverse event should also be reported to the inves tigator’s 
IRB per their reporting requirements.  
12.4  CA[LOCATION_003]L RELATIO NSHIP  
The investigator should always be alert to adverse events that may be related to the 
study device or the use of the study device (i.e., the procedure specific to the initial 
applicat ion of the device).  An attempt should be made in every case to determine the 
causality of the event.  The following definitions are to be used as guidelines in 
determining the relationship between the event and the study device and/or use of the 
device.   
Definitely related:  If the event is associated with the device and/or the use of the 
device beyond a reasonable doubt, a causal relationship exists 
between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the 
study device.  
Probably related:   There is a  reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the 
study device and/or the adverse event cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_5748].  
Possibly related:   The adverse event has not been determ ined to be related to the 
device or the use of the device, but no other cause has been 
identified and the device and/or the use of the study device 
cannot be ruled out as a possible cause.  
Unlikely to be related:  The possibility of a potential causal relat ionship between 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the device could 
exist, but the adverse event can be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748].  
Not related:  There is no possibility of a causal relationship between the 
adverse event and the devic e and/or the use of the study device 
and/or the adverse event can be attributed to another cause.  
If an adverse event is believed to be definitely, probably or possibly related to the study 
device and/or the use of the device, the event will be considered related to the study 
device and/or the use of the device.    
12.5  ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOW -UP 
For every serious or device -related adverse event, appropriate measures should be 
undertaken to treat and/or monitor the subject until resolution occurs.  Obtain and  
maintain in the subject's files all pertinent medical data relating to the event including the 
subject’s medical records and medical reports and/or judgments from colleagues or 
outside specialists who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject .  The 
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION , INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 5.0  31 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  investigator should keep JJSV  closely informed as to the outcome of serious and/or 
device -related adverse events, thereby [CONTACT_32503].  The SAE/ADE CRF within the electronic data cap ture 
system should be updated as needed each time the subject returns to the investigator or 
other specialist(s) for follow -up of serious and/or device -related adverse event until 
resolution of the event.  Any subject who is exited from the study due to a serious and/or 
device -related adverse event will be followed until the outcome is determined.  
13. PROTOCOL CHANGES  AND PROCEDURES  
If the investigator desires to modify any procedure and/or the design of the study, he or 
she must contact [CONTACT_32504] .  Any modifications (including additional data collection) require approval 
by [CONTACT_32505], as well as approval of the

18. RISK ANALYSIS  
POTENTIAL RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  
RISKS OF THE SYMFONY  TORIC IOLS  
The Symfony Toric IOLs are intended to compensate for corneal astigmatism and to 
mitigate the effects of presby[CONTACT_32507] a continuous range of high -quality vision 
by [CONTACT_32508].  Compared to an aspheric monofocal IOL, the lens 
provides improved intermediate and near visual acuity, while maintaining comparable 
distance visual acuity; however, glasses may still be needed to improve distance vision 
and/or to have useful vision for intermediate or near tasks.  The Symfony Toric  IOLs may 
cause a reduction in contrast sensitivity under certain conditions, compared to an 
aspheric monofocal IOL.  Some visual effects associated with the Symfony Toric IOL 
may be expected due to the lens design that delivers elongation of focus. These may 
include a perception of halos, glare, or starbursts around lights under nighttime 
conditions.  In addition, rotation of the  Symfony Toric IOL away from its intended axis 
can reduce its astigmatic correction.  Misalignment greater than 30° may increase 
postoperative refractive cylinder.  If necessary, lens repositioning should occur as early 
as possible prior to lens encapsulation. These risks are not unlike other lenses of this 
kind.   
GENERAL RISKS OF CAT ARACT SURGERY AND IO L IMPLANTATION  
There are ris ks and complications associated with cataract surgery and IOL implantation 
in general.  These can include worsening of vision, hemorrhage, loss of corneal clarity, 
inflammation, infections, retinal detachment, pupil changes, glaucoma, etc.  
Complications c an result in poor vision, loss of vision or loss of the eye.   
RISK MANAGEMENT  
Subjects will be closely monitored thought the trial duration.  The occurrence of adverse 
events and complaints will be assessed at each study visit and reported to JJSV  
accordi ng to Section 12, Adverse Events and Product Complaints.  Additionally, JJSV  
will monitor incoming data following the procedures outlined in Section 16, Monitoring .  
The Medical Monitor will ensure subjects are not exposed to additional risks  by 
[CONTACT_32509], device -related adverse events, and 
device -deficiencies that could have led to serious adverse events (Section 16.3, 
Medical  Oversight ).  

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION , INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 5.0  36 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The clinical performance of the Symfony Toric IOL, Models ZXT150, ZXT300 an d 
ZXT375, is expected to be similar to the non -toric Symfony IOL, Model ZXR00 ([LOCATION_003] 
FDA approval P980040/S065), with respect to mitigating the effects of presby[CONTACT_32478].  Compared to an aspheric monofocal IOL, the 
lens is  expected to provide improved intermediate and near visual acuity, while 
maintaining comparable distance visual acuity.  In addition, the Symfony Toric IOLs are 
expected to be similar to the TECNIS Toric Model Series ZCT IOLs ([LOCATION_003] FDA approval 
P980040/039)  for reduction in residual refractive cylinder.  
CONCLUSION  
The hazards/risks associated with the Symfony Toric IOL, Models ZXT150, ZXT300 and 
ZXT375, are acceptable and within those of JJSV ’s other advanced optic IOLs.  The 
potential clinical benefits of these lenses outweigh the residual risks when the device is 
used as intended.

All study -related correspondence, subject records, consent forms, Authorization for 
Use/Disclosure of Health Information Forms or similar medical treatment p rivacy law

20. TERMINATION OF T HE INVESTIGATION  
The clinical investigation will be suspended in the event that high levels of complications 
and/or adverse events occur that are unexpected in nature and/or severity and are 
possibly related to use of the study device.  The clinical investigation may be suspended 
if the Medical Monitor or IRB, upon review and evaluation of the clinical data, finds 
unacceptable clinical performance or the level of single or total complications and/or 
adverse events unacceptable for continuation of the investigation.  
If causality is shown not to be related to the study device, the study may be resumed in 
accordance with the IRB and regulations of the FDA. The study will be terminated if 
causality  is shown to be related to the study device.  
Additionally, the investigator or JJSV  may stop a subject’s participation at any time.  
JJSV  may also stop the study at any time for reasons it determines appropriate.  
However, no suspension of the study would be made to disadvantage the study 
subjects.  Following suspension of the study for any reason, all study subjects who have 
already received treatment should continue to be followed through completion of the 
study visit schedule.  
21. STATISTICAL METH ODS  
This section highlights the analyses to be performed for key study endpoints.  The 
6-month postoperative visit is the critical analysis time point for all endpoints.  Outcomes 
for subjects implanted with the higher -cylinder IOLs (ZXT300 and ZXT375) and the 
lower -cylinder control lens (ZXT150) will be reported separately.  Descriptive statistics 
will typi[INVESTIGATOR_32467], standard deviation, minimum, maximum for continuous data 
with frequency and proportion reported for categorical data.   
21.1 ANALYSIS POPU LATION  
For the primary endpoint, the primary analysis population will be all bilaterally -implanted 
subjects having available data at the 6 -month visit, with data reported separately for the 
higher - and lower -cylinder groups.  Data will also be reported for all su bjects, including 
bilateral subjects and those with only one eye implanted (having a phakic lens, a 
cataract or other IOL in the fellow eye).   
 
 
.   
 

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION , INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 5.0  38 PR/TIOL -205-STPA   
   
In addition to the primary population analyses discussed above, additional analyses will 
also be performed for the primary endpoint to evaluate the  
at the six -month visit who did not undergo repositioning or IOL removal.  
 
 
For other questionnaire items, bilaterally -implanted subjects with data at six months 
postoperative will be used for analysis.  Refraction, monocular visual ac uity, 
medical/lens findings and adverse event data will be reported for primary eyes (first eye 
implanted) and fellow eyes.  Data will be reported separately for the higher -cylinder 
group (ZXT300, ZXT375) and the lower -cylinder control eyes (ZXT150).   
21.[ADDRESS_31883] primary endpoint is t he rate of bothersome visual symptoms ,  
 
.  The second primary endpoint is  the rate of 
reported difficulty with an activity due to  one or more visual symptoms , determined by a 
“Yes” response to the question “Is there anything you have a lot of difficulty with, or do 
not do, because of [visual symptom]”) at 6  months postoperative .   
The frequency and proportion of subjects with bothersome visual symptoms for one or 
more visual symptoms , and the frequency and proportion of subjects reporting difficulty 
with an activity due to one or more  visual symptoms will be reported along with the two -
sided, 95% confidence interval at the [ADDRESS_31884] Size:   
Using an assumed value of 20% for bothersome visual symptoms  or difficulty with an 
activity due to visual symptoms,  and a sample size of 240 evaluable subjects per group , 
a two -sided 95% confidence interval will estimate the observed rate of bothersome 
visual symptoms to within 4.2 percentage points .  

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION , INC. CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 5.0  39 PR/TIOL -205-STPA  21.3 ADDITIONAL ENDP OINTS  
The frequency and proportion of subjects with each response will be reported for the 
individual visual symptom items for overall and with and without correction.   
The frequency and proportion achieving each acuity level will be reported for monocular 
visual acuity.   
Descriptive statistics will be reported for mean percent reduction in cyli nder, refractive 
cylinder, cylinder vs preoperatively -predicted cylinder, spherical equivalent and spherical 
equivalent vs preoperatively -predicted spherical equivalent .  The frequency and 
proportion of eyes within 0.50 D and within 1.00 D of the preoperat ively-predicted values 
will be reported for refractive cylinder and spherical equivalent.  Percent reduction in 
cylinder will be calculated for each eye using the following formula:   
100*((Postop Ref. Cyl. - Preop K. Cyl.)/(Target Ref. Cyl. - Preop K. Cyl . )) 
 Key: Ref. Cyl.=absolute refractive cylinder; K. Cyl.=keratometric cylinder;  
Refractive data will be referred to the corneal plane prior to determining percent 
reduction in cylinder . 
Enrollment data, demographic data, subject accountability data and operative 
complications/procedures will be reported using descriptive statistics.  Visual symptom 
findings, adverse events and other key data will be reported at 1 year for subjects who 
experienced a repositioning procedure during the study or who were rep orted with 
bothersome visual symptoms at the 6 -month visit.  
The frequency and proportion of primary and fellow eyes with medical/lens findings will 
also be reported.  In addition, rates of IOL repositioning procedures (secondary surgical 
intervention) due  to IOL misalignment, rates of explants related to visual symptoms , 
rates of refractive procedures performed during the study period,  and other adverse 
events will be reported .

B.  Ratings of Corneal Edema  
Corneal edema should be classified according to the haziness of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], the number of 
microcysts observed, and the clouding of the stroma.  
Amount  Grade  Description  
None  0 Normal transparency:  
a. No epi[INVESTIGATOR_32468] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_32469]  
b. No microcysts  
c. No stromal cloudiness  
Trace  +1 a. Barely discernible localized epi[INVESTIGATOR_32468] -epi[INVESTIGATOR_32469], and/or  
b. 1 to 20 microcysts, and/or  
c. Barely discernible localized stromal cloudiness  
Mild +2 a. Faint but definite localized or generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], sub -epi[INVESTIGATOR_32470]/cloudiness, and/or  
b. 21-50 microcysts  
Moderate  +3 a. Significant localized or generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], sub -epi[INVESTIGATOR_32471]/cloudiness and/or  
b. 51-100 microcysts  
Severe  +4 a. Definite widespread epi[INVESTIGATOR_32472], giving dull glass 
appearance to cornea or numerous coalescent bullae (please note the 
number and location of bullae), and/or  
b. >100 microcysts or bullae, and/or  
c. Numerous striae (please note the number and location of striae or folds)

pearls in the posterior capsule.  Red reflex mildly diminished.  
Moderate  +3 Moderate loss of transparency with difficulty visualizing the 
retina.  There may be multiple Elschnig’s pearls in the 
posterior capsule.  Red reflex markedly diminished.  
Severe  +[ADDRESS_31886] confluent Elschnig’s pearls 
and fibrous scarring.  Red reflex barely visible.  
 
E.  IOL Glistenings  
Use the following scale to grade IOL glistenings, using a slit beam 2.0 mm wide and 10.0  mm 
long:  
Amount  Grade  Description  
None  0 No glistenings visible  
Rare  +0.5 <10 glistenings visible  
Trace  [PHONE_518] glistenings visible  
Mild [PHONE_519] glistenings visible  
Moderate  [PHONE_520] glistenings visible  
Severe  +4 ≥ 40 glistenings visible

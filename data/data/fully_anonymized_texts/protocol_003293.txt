EGGO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Over 1/[ADDRESS_708812] higher rates of poor pregnancy 
outcomes including stillbirth, fetal growth problems , diabetes, hypertension, and maternal death.  
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a frequent pregnancy complication in obese women and is associated with 
increased risk of large infants, cesarean delivery, and high blood pressure.  Although treatment of GDM 
improves these outcomes, obese women seem to benefit less from treatment than non-obese women.  This 
is perhaps because obese women develop GDM earlier in  pregnancy than normal weight women, leading 
to the baby [CONTACT_543113] a longer period prior to diagnosis and treatment. 
The purpose of this study is to determine if scree ning obese women for gestational diabetes early in 
their pregnancy (at 14-20 weeks) improves pregnancy outcomes compared to screening obese women for 
gestational diabetes at the routine time (24-28 weeks). This study was created at UAB and will enroll 
1,160 obese women at two study sites: UAB and Ochsne r (New Orleans, LA).  A confidential, computer-
generated randomization scheme will be prepared by a designated study biostatistician.  Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_543114] (BMI ≥40.0 vs BMI <40).  Randomization will also be stratified for 
both participating sites.   
 2. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 
 
Patient characteristics at randomization will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_91727].  The two study 
groups will be labeled as Early (for early gestational diabetes screening 14-18 weeks) and Routine (for routine gestational diabetes screening 20-24 weeks) . For continuous variables, means/medians and 
standard deviations/interquartile ra nges will be reported.  To assess and/ or identify covariates for which 
adjusted sensitivity analyses might be conducted, Student  t-tests will be used to compare means between 
study groups.  Where appropriate, medians and quart iles will be reported and the Wilcoxon rank sum test 
will be used as an alternative comparison procedur e.  Categorical measures will be presented as counts 
and percentages and will be compared using the χ
[ADDRESS_708813] of association is not appropriate, Fisher’s exact test 
will be used.    Balance overall is expected because of  the large sample size and we expect approximately 
5% to be different by [CONTACT_3364], since we are not adjusting these baseline comparisons for multiple testing. Any group characteristics that are identified as statisti cally significantly different between the two groups 
at a 0.05 level of significance will be considered as covariates in multivariable models in subsequent analyses of the primary study outcome.  
 
  
 
3. PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS 
 
3.1. Primary Hypothesis #1: Impact of Early GDM Screening on the Primary Outcome (a Composite of Key Perinatal Outcomes)  
 
H
0: There will be no difference in the rate of the primary outcome (quantified by [CONTACT_543115]) in EGGO participants randomized to the Early screening 
group compared to participants random ized to the Routine screening Group.  
 
3.1.1.  Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is a composite of the following items: macrosomia, 
primary cesarean, pregnancy induced hypertension (gestational hypertension or preeclampsia), 
shoulder dystocia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia.  The occurrence of 1 or more of these items will be considered an  occurrence of the primary study outcome.  
Individual definitions of these outcomes are listed below. 
 
a. Macrosomia: Will be defined by [CONTACT_543116].  Macrosomia is a birth weight >4000 g.   
b. Primary cesarean:  A primary cesarean delivery for any indication will be considered as 
having the outcome of interest.  
 
c. Gestational hypertension: Defined by [CONTACT_88087] ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure 
≥90 without proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio <0.19 or mg ).  
 
d. Preeclampsia: Defined by [CONTACT_88087] ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 with 
proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 0.30).  Preeclampsia diagnosis will also be refined 
by [CONTACT_543117].  Severe preeclampsia will be defined as systolic blood pressure ≥160, 
diastolic blood pressure ≥110, platelets <100, AST >80 serum creatinine >1.2.
  
 
e. Shoulder dystocia: As documented by [CONTACT_543118]; defined as requiring more than 
routine downward traction to achieve delivery of anterior shoulder.  The length of  the 
shoulder dystocia and maneuvers required to relieve the shoulder dystocia will be documented.   
f. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: Neonatal bilirubin le vels will be recorded.  Hyperbilirubinemia 
will be defined >95th percentile gestational age and hour of life.  The treatment of 
hyperbilirubinemia (i.e. phototherapy) will also be recorded.   
g. Neonatal hypoglycemia.  Blood sugar levels will be abstr acted from neonatal charts.  
Neonatal hypoglycemia will be defined as blood sugar <35mg/dL.   
  
3.1.2. Analysis Plan:  This hypothesis effect of Early versus Routine GDM screening in obese pregnant 
women.  The χ
[ADDRESS_708814] of association will be used to evaluate wh ether the rate of the primary outcome differs 
between the treatment groups.  The primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis of all individuals 
randomized to the two treatment groups, regardless of whether evaluation plans were followed.  Risk 
ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (C Is) will be computed and presented.   
Standard comparison of the covariate characteristics at baseline between study groups will be 
undertaken (Section 2) to assess the randomization ba lance on measured covariates. Tests of significance 
will be two-sided and evaluated at the 0.05 level of significance.  Since the sample size for EGGO is 
large, it is unlikely that “important ” covariates (such as race, BMI or age) will be imbalanced through the 
 
randomization process.  Further, randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_44207] (BMI <40 and BMI ≥40) and site 
(UAB and Oschsner). 
In the unlikely event that imbalance occurs, adjust ment for covariates will be made by [CONTACT_543119]-odds of the outcome using multivariable logi stic regression including terms indicating group 
membership and each of the imbalanced covariates.  In  other words, the log-odds of the primary outcome 
for any individual will be modeled using the following form: 
 
lnቀ௉ሺ௢௨௧௖௢௠௘ ሻ
ଵି௉ሺ௢௨௧௖௢௠௘ ሻቁൌߚ଴൅ߚଵݔଵ൅∑ߚ௝ݖ௝. 
 
Above, x 1 = 1 if the patient is in the Early group and equa ls 0 if the patient is in the Routine group. 
The set of zj’s consists of all covariates in the model in cluding site. Hence, under this model, the term [ADDRESS_708815] for 
primary hypothesis #1, we will perform a statistical test of H0: 1 = 0 vs. H1: 1  0. Quantification of the 
treatment effect will be performed by [CONTACT_543120], exp( 1), to obtain an 
estimate of the odds ratio.  The confidence in terval will be determined similarly.   
The stratification by [CONTACT_543121].  The presence of a homogeneous effect across center and across BMI 
thresholds will be examined using the Breslow-Day test.   
 3.1.3. Sample Size for Primary Outcome:  Based on prior studies performed at UAB, the incidence of 
macrosomia, cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia, a nd preeclampsia in obese women with gestational 
diabetes was 56%.  Using a conservative estimate of these outcomes as 50%, to detect a 50% reduction in 
the incidence of adverse outcomes ( α=0.05, β =0.80), [ADDRESS_708816] be randomized to each diagnostic procedure in order to achieve 58 
gestational diabetics in each group.  Prior reports of the incidence of GDM are between 6-20% depending 
on ethnicity and the screening and diagnostic criteri a used.  Using an incidence of 10% GDM in obese 
women, 580 subjects per screening group are necessary .  Approximately 3,100 women per year attend the 
UAB clinic for obstetric visits, and approximately 40% of these women are obese.  Assuming a 50% acceptance of enrollment, we anticipate enrolling 620 women per year.  Therefore, we feel that we can enroll 1,160 subjects in 3 years.   
3.2. Interim Monitoring : One interim analysis, evaluating both efficacy and futility, will be conducted 
after [ADDRESS_708817] completed the study ([ADDRESS_708818] delivered).  Under the assumption 
that 10% of obese women have GDM, we expect to have approximately 30 gestational diabetics in each 
group.  Using an O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending fu nction and one interim analysis, we will use the 
following critical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543110]:  
 
At the interim look:   If χ
2 >7.82 (i.e. p < 0.005) then reject H 0 and consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; 
Otherwise, continue.   
 
At the final look: If χ2 > 3.91 (i.e. p < 0.048) then reject H 0.  
 
We do not propose a formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_543111], but note that the DSMB will be presented 
with safety data and information on study progress.  In  addition, we note that the overall sample size of 58 
gestational diabetics per group will provide 80% power for the hypothesized effect  size using a modified 
alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_708819] the 
DSMB in their evaluation of efficacy and futility. 
 
 
The interim analysis will focus only on outcomes specified in Section 3 of this Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Secondary outcomes may be presented at that time in aggregate form (only safety events will be presented 
by [CONTACT_2060]).  Formal statistical hypothesis t esting for those secondary ou tcomes will be conducted at 
the conclusion of the trial.  
 At the time of the interim analysis, the Ochsner st udy site will have contributed a small number of 
patients to the study.  These patients will be  excluded from the interim analysis evaluation. 
 
4. Secondary Hypotheses and Sub-Analyses 
 
For the primary outcome, separate analyses will be  conducted to evaluate each component of the 
composite.  In addition, the rates of preterm birth <37 weeks will be evaluated. Specific aims 2 and 3 will also be investigated.  
4.1. Specific Aim 2:  To test the hypothesis that a lower diagnostic threshold for GDM at 14-[ADDRESS_708820]-trimester testing. 
 
4.1.1.  Secondary Hypothesis #1: Identification of a blood sugar value identified at early GDM 
screening that detects GDM outcomes and reduces the need for third-trimester screening  
 H
0: There will be no association between early scree ning blood glucose levels and the rates of (a) 
hypoglycemic medication use, (b) the primary outc ome, (c) macrosomia, and (d) third trimester 
testing in EGGO participants randomized to the Early screening group  
 4.1.2.  Statistical Analysis:  Therefore, we will evaluate the ability of an early GDM screen to predict 
several outcomes.  We will compare early GDM screening to GDM testing at 24-[ADDRESS_708821] to the following outcomes: the need for hypoglycemic medications during pregnancy, the composite outcome from Specific Aim #1, macrosomia (a common complication of GDM), and third trimester testing.  Logistic regression models will also be considered.  R eceiver operator 
characteristics (ROC) curves will be created to identify an ideal cut point.  The area under the 
curve (the c statistic) will be  used to assess the models. 
 
4.2. Specific Aim 3:  To test the hypothesis that 1,5-anh ydroglucitol, a sensitive marker of recent 
hyperglycemic excursions, can be used as a simp le and sensitive serum te st for GDM in the obese 
population. 
 
4.2.1.  Secondary Hypothesis #2: Association between AG levels and GDM diagnosis  
 
H
0: There will be no difference in the mean AG levels in EGGO participants with GDM and in 
EGGO participants without GDM. 
 
4.2.2.  Statistical Analysis: The AG levels of women with and without GDM will be compared using a 
student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate.  A receiver operator characteristics curve will be created for AG to predict GDM (as diagnosed by a positive test at 24-28 weeks), need for hypoglycemic medications, and macrosomia.  Th e area under the ROC curve will be calculated 
and an ideal cut-point for AG will be determin ed.  The sensitivity, speci ficity, positive predictive 
value, and negative predictive value of AG will be determined. 
 
  
 
5. Additional Analyses 
 
The EGGO study provides an opportunity for investigation beyond the research hypotheses explicitly 
stated in the original grant application and stud y protocol.  The EGGO Steering Committee will assess the 
pre-specified secondary analysis concepts listed below for feasibility and potential for scientific impact.  
Approved concepts will be prioritized; the committee may not approve all concepts.  Furthermore the 
evaluation of some concepts is dependent upon know ledge of the study’s primary results and sufficient 
numbers of subjects enrolled with specific characteristics.   
 
Secondary analysis proposals may include: 
3. Any comparisons of non-GDM and GDM women 
4. Any lab comparisons 
5. Anything with obstetric complications as the outcome 
6. Neonatal outcomes 
7. Postpartum outcomes

3.1 Disease Background  
Patients with Parkinson Disease (PD) typi[INVESTIGATOR_75077], rigidity , and 
frequently rest ing tremor along with other hallmarks such as shuffling gait, decreased 
blinking, decreased arm swing, hypophonia, hypomimia, micrographia , and decreased 
smell and taste.  In the later stages of the d isease, dementia, postural instability , and 
freezing of gait are also common. Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the more debilitating 
motor complications of PD.1, 2  It is manifested by [CONTACT_75102] “sticking to the ground” for 
several seconds during active movement. FOG occurs initially when the patient is turning 
or when initiating gait (start -hesitation).  Later, it occurs when the patient reaches a 
destination, such as a chair, and the patient stops too soon, before fully reaching the 
desired desti nation.  
FOG is a complex disorder that can also be seen as an entity of its own in primary 
progressive freezing of gait (PPFG), primary akinesia with gait freezing (PAGF) , or in 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_75078], progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP), corticobasal syndrome (CBS) , and multiple systems atrophy (MSA).  FOG has 
been thought to be due either to a variant in the disease process in certain individuals, or 
potentially as a side effect of levodopa, one of the mainstay medications us ed to treat the 
symptoms of PD.  Earlier onset FOG  has been associated with earlier onset of 
dyskinesias and postural instability, the presence of hallucinations and greater 
neocortical Lewy Body burden.3 FOG in PD can occur both as a phenomen on of the 
“OFF state” which improves with addition of dopaminergic medications (i.e., either 
levodopa or dopamine agonists), but in an unknown percentage it also occurs in the “ON 
state” and does not respond to increased levodopa.  In fact FOG in the “ON state” is 
often reported to worsen with incrementally h igher levodopa doses.  
The presence of gait freezing results in a significant worsening of quality of life for 
patients. Freezing leads to decreased mobility, increased rates of falls , and subsequent 
fear of falling , which further limits mobility.4-[ADDRESS_81564] for FOG . Methylphenidate, a stimulant 
used in the treatment of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, inhibits presynaptic 
dopamine8 and the noradrenaline transporter. Used at high doses (1 mg/kg/day), 
methylphenidate has been shown to decrease the number of steps taken by [CONTACT_75103] (STN) DBS in the stand -walk-sit (SWS) test, 
but it has not been widely adopted due to cardiac side effects.[ADDRESS_81565]  Background  
The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is a part of the reticular activating system, and 
arousing stimuli simultaneously activate ascending projections to the intralaminar 
thalamus triggering high frequency cortical activity, and descending projections to the 
reticulospi[INVESTIGATOR_75079]. This has led to the PPN being

as a potential target for treating FOG in PD.10-12 PPN neurons fire at beta/gamma 
frequencies during waki ng and REM sleep but not during slow wave sleep.13 These 
oscill ations are mediated by [CONTACT_75104] N - and P/Q -type calcium 
channels.[ADDRESS_81566] shown that beta/gamma oscillations in PPN 
neurons were blocked by [CONTACT_50573] -93 (a CAMKII activation inhibitor), which suggests that at 
least some cells produce oscillations through the CAMKII pathway.   
Modafinil, a stimulant approved by [CONTACT_75105]  (decreases 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] a nd regulates sleep -wake cycles) , has a number of putative sites of 
action.[ADDRESS_81567] as KN -93 also inhibits the effects of 
modafinil.16, 17  Modafinil has also been shown to bind to the dopamine transporter and 
prevent dopamine reuptake, increasing the level of dopamine in the synaptic cleft.18  
Modafinil is a 1:[ADDRESS_81568] different pharmacokinetics 
(The half -life of R -modafinil is approximately three times that of S -Modafin il in humans). 
The effective elimination half -life of Modafinil is about 15 hours with linear kinetics upon 
multiple dosing of 200 -600 mg/day with steady  state reached after 2 -4 days of dosing  for 
narcolepsy .  Modafinil is absorbed orally with peak plasma concentrations in 2 -4 hours . 
The major route of elimination is metabolism (approximately 90%) by [CONTACT_75106].  In-vitro data suggests that Modafinil is a 
weak inducer of CYP3A activity in a concentration depen dent manner and therefore may 
reduce the effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g. steroidal 
contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, triazolam). Data also suggest that Modafinil is a 
weak inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 (war farin and phenytoin). Modafinil is 
also a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19 and therefore may increase concentrations of 
drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_75107] (e.g. phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole , 
and clomipramine). Modafinil may interact with some CNS active drugs that PD patients 
may be using including certain tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]2C19) and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6). 
Also concomitant administration of quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_75080].  
Based on data from the Garcia -Rill lab  and a prior unpublished trial at the Little Rock VA 
on Modafinil in PTSD patients, subjects were found to be more jittery at doses of 100mg 
and higher (unpublished, personal communicat ion). Therefore for this study low dose 
Modafinil at 50 mg orally daily will be trialed (the FDA approved recommended dosing for 
Narcolepsy is 200 mg/day for Narcolepsy).  Additionally small studies in elderly 
populations suggest decreased clearance of Moda finil in elderly populations. One study 
showed approximately 20% decrease in oral clearance in 12 subjects given a single dose 
of 200 mg modafinil (mean age 63 years, range 53 -72 years) , while a study with multiple 
doses of 300 mg/day Modafinil in 12 subje cts (mean age 82 years, range 67 -87 years ) 
showed mean plasma levels were two times those in historical younger subjects.

Date: 06/28/17  3.3 Rationale  
FOG is present in approximately 60% of patients with P D and is a major cause of gait 
impairment leading to falls, and the morbidity and decreased quality of life . Currently , 
other than levodopa therapy, which can be limited in later stages of disease when FOG 
occurs by [CONTACT_75108], no alternative treatments exist. Modafinil, as 
described above, has been shown by [CONTACT_75109] -Rill lab to modulate pathways in the 
PPN that link arousal and gait dynamics. Additionally , PPN DBS has also been shown to 
modulate gait  and falls  in patients. As such , we propose to study whether Modafinil can 
improve FOG  in PD. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , we will focus on recruiting PD patient s with FOG  
and use  a delayed start trial model to determine whether FOG  improves compared to 
placebo. We chose the delayed start trial model as opposed to just having a placebo arm 
as it will likely help with  recruitment and subject retention if all subject s know that at least 
during 3 months of the trial they will all be receiving active drug.  Additionally , preliminary 
data (unpublished, UAMS IRB#203234) from my lab suggests that PD patients with FOG 
have a faster rate of decline in objective gait parameters compared to PD patients, even 
over a period of 3 -6 months. Therefore , with the delayed start model we will also 
determine if there are any changes in the slope of decline in PD -FOG patients over the 
perio d of the trial.  
4.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
This is a single -center, prospective, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, delayed -
start pi[INVESTIGATOR_75081] 25  subjects with PD and FOG. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 
early start ( 24 weeks  active treatment) or delayed start ( 12 weeks  placebo followed by 12 weeks  
active treatment) oral Modafinil 50 mg/day.  Following 24 weeks of treatment, a 2 week washout 
of the drug will be performed with a follow -up assessment at 26 weeks.  
4.1 Primary Objectives  
4.1.1  To determine if 50 mg/day Modafinil decreases FOG  in PD patients with FOG 
compared with placebo as measured by [CONTACT_75110]  
(FOG -Q). 
4.1.2  To determine if 50 mg/day Modafinil decreased the decline stride length seen in 
PD patients with FOG.  
 
4.2 Secondary Objectives   
4.2.1  To determine if 50 mg/day Modafinil improves motor function in PD patients with 
FOG compared to placebo as measured by [CONTACT_75111].  
4.2.2  To describe the adverse events associated with Modafinil do sed at 50 mg/day for 
3-6 months in P D patients.  
4.2.3  To determine if quality of life is improved with Modafinil as measured by [CONTACT_75112] -39. 
4.2.4  To determine if sleep disorders are improved with Modafinil as measured by [CONTACT_75113][INVESTIGATOR_7110].

4.4 Endpoints  
4.4.1  Primary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To determine if 50 mg/day Modafinil decreases freezing of gait in PD 
patients with FOG compared with placebo as measured by [CONTACT_75115] (FOG -Q) after [ADDRESS_81569] 
6 weeks of either treatment arm will be included in this analysis . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To determine if 50 mg/day Modafinil decreased the decline stride 
length seen in PD patients  with FOG.  The rate of decline in stride 
length will be compared plotting the stride length at steady state in 
subjects in the early and late -start arms to determine if the rate of 
decline improves in subjects taking Modafinil in the early -start arm 
and wh ether this rate of decline also improves in the second phase of 
the trial in the delayed -start arm.  
We will also determine if at the completion of 24 weeks, the early -start 
arm has differential change in slope of other continuous gait 
parameters (stride w idth, gait cycle time, gait cycle velocity, swing and 
stance percent, total single and double support time, cadence) 
compared to the delayed start arm suggesting that Modafinil slows the 
progression of the gait decline.

Modafinil  
For this study Modafinil 50 mg oral capsules will be produced and dispensed by [CONTACT_75122]. Subjects will 
take Modafinil 50 mg capsule oral daily for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks depending upon 
whether they are in the early -start or delayed -start arm of the trial as described below 
(see Figure 1).  
Placebo  
For this study placebo capsules will be made of gelatin capsules filled with 
microcrystalline cellulose and will be identical to the Modafinil capsule. Subjects in the 
delayed start arm will receive 12 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks of Modafinil 50 
mg oral daily (see Figure 1)  
 
6.1.1  Dispensing

with the treatment regimen. Patients will also be asked to return the pi[INVESTIGATOR_75084]. If patients are unable to 
provide the pi[INVESTIGATOR_75085] a form stating their 
compliance with the study dosing regimen.  
6.2 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
 
The research pharmacy will create a randomization log, randomizing 20 subjects 1:1 to 
early start or delayed start modafinil (Figure 1). Subjects wi ll be assigned the next line in 
the log in order of treatment. Subjects in the early -start arm will receive Modafinil 50 mg 
oral daily  (a.m.)  for [ADDRESS_81576] 12 weeks of active treatment followed by [CONTACT_75125] 50 mg oral daily 
for weeks 13 -24 of the active treatment period. The drug will be washed out for a 2 week 
perio d with repeat assessments to determine any withdrawal symptoms.  
 
 
6.3 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity as described in section 9 . If 
patients develop the following toxic side effects to Modafinil 50 mg (current FDA dosing 
for narcolepsy is 4 times this dose at 200 mg), they will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
• Stevens -Johnson Syndrome  
• Angioedema and Anaphylaxis  
• multi -organ failure  
• persistent excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• psychiatric symptoms ( any out of  mania, delusions, suicidal ideations, 
paranoid delusions, or auditory halluci nations)  
• cardiovascular events  (chest pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea, ischemic T -wave 
changes on elect rocardiogram)  
 
 
Figure 1: Delayed -start trial model with 1:[ADDRESS_81577] 12 weeks followed by [CONTACT_75125] 50mg oral

6.4 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
All antidopaminergic agents (including typi[INVESTIGATOR_75086], 
antidopaminergic antiemetics and antidopaminergic antidepressants) are restricted 
during the period of this trial and would in any case be contraindicated for use in patients 
with Parkinson disease.  
6.5 Other Modalities or Procedures  
No other modalities (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy) or procedures (e.g., hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation) will be used in the protocol treatment.  
6.6 Duration of T herapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  a 
total of 24 weeks or until:  
• Disease progression  is documented per the judgment of the investigator  
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of t reatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  (see section 6.3)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in t he judgment of the investigator .

such as step t ime and length, stride time and length, stride velocity and acceleration, 
swing time, gait cycle time, center of pressure of each foot, center of body mass and 
coefficients of variation between these.  In addition, parameters of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_75088], center of mass variation during the freeze 
and amplitude and frequency of tremor in the legs during the freezing epi[INVESTIGATOR_75089].   The program also provides raw data of every sensor 
reading during footfall allowing for a large number of additional parameters to be 
calculated and based on initial results, these parameters may be assessed in the future. 
The sensor data is time locked to two cameras to allow for accurate characterization of  
foot falls.  Subjects will be assessed in the OFF levodopa state and 60 minutes after 
taking their regularly prescribed levodopa dose at each time point.

7.4 Removal of Subjects from Study  
Patients can be taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their own 
request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, 
behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will be 
documented and may include:  
▪ Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow -up permitte d); 
▪ Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
▪ Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
▪ Patient demonstrates disease progression (unless continued treatment with 
study drug is deemed appropriate at the discretion of the investigator);  
▪ Patient experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol unsafe;  
▪ Treating physician judges continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s 
best interest;  
▪ Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same t imelines as a 
serious adverse event);  
▪ Lost to follow -up. If a research subject canno t be contact[CONTACT_75126][INVESTIGATOR_75090] [ADDRESS_81586] b e documented and

8.0 Outcome Measures  
8.1 Improvement in FOG  
8.1.1  Motor assessments  
Giladi freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG -Q): Validated questionnaire with 6 
items rated 0 -4 for a total of 24 points in total. We will be looking for a 10% 
change in this questionnaire to suggest a subjective improvement in freezing of 
gait over the course of the study . 
 
UPDRS Part III motor score:  Validated rating scale used to quantify the 
movement disorders motor examination including items for bradykinesia, tremor, 
rigidity and gait.  
 
Gait and balance measures : Will evaluate for changes in steady state gait and 
balance measures using the assessments outlined in section 7.2 including mean 
and percent coefficient of variability in:  
• Stride length

8.1.2  Cognitive assessments : 
The following cognitive assessments will be administered by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Virmani or other 
trained study personnel. [CONTACT_75137] -Fausett (licensed psychologist) will supervise 
the interpretation of these results.  
 
Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA): commonly used scale to screen for 
cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson disease patients.  
 
Frontal assessment battery (FAB): commonly used scale to screen for frontal 
lobe dysfunction that can be suggestive of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_75091].  
 
SCOPA -cog: cognitive rating scale used in European trials to track cognitive 
function in Parkinson disease patients.  
 
Stroop  test: test of mental flexability and set shifting using colored words that 
FOG patients have been shown in some preliminary studies to have more 
difficulty with than PD without FOG patients.  
 
8.1.3  Psychometric, sleep and quality of life scales  
Epworth sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_50526] : scale commonly used in sleep medicine to evaluate 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_75092] (or undertreated) sleep apnea. 
As Modafinil has benefit in arousal, will track patients to see if they are reporting 
improved daytime sleepi [INVESTIGATOR_75093] .  
 
REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) screening questionaire : parasomnias are 
commonly reported in PD and RBD is a prominent non -motor feature that is 
thought to be a pre -motor symptoms of the disease . As reticular activating 
pathways play a role in sleep, this will be used as measure to see if sleep is 
altered by [CONTACT_75127].  
 
Apathy evaluation scale (AES) : Validated questionnaire to assess ap athy in 
patients.  Apathy has been reported as correlated with overall level of motor 
function and will be tracked to see if apathy improved with the treatment .  
 
PDQ -39: validated questionnaire to assess overall quality of life in PD patients 
and will be t racked to determine whether any objective improvement in FOG 
overall leads to improved subjective assessment of quality of life .

Parkinson disease it is FDA approved for the treatment of narcolepsy and has had a 
number of small clinical trials for use on various psychiatric conditions (ex. Depression  
and PTSD) but also is commonly used off label for daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. It has also been 
previously tested in Parkinson’s disease patients with fatigue (total of 53 patients).19, [ADDRESS_81588] recent safety update, please refer to the commercially available drug insert 
for Modafinil (PROVIGIL) . 
 
Modafinil has previously been FDA approved for use in patients with narcolepsy.  In 
clinical trials 151 pro tocol specified doses of up to 1600 mg/day have been administered 
to 32 subjects with no reported life -threatening events. Case reports of up to 4500 
mg/dose also have not reported life -threatening events but reported excitation, agitation, 
insomnia and mo derate elevation in hemodynamic parameters.  
9.1.1  Contraindications:  
• Allergic reaction to any of the ingredients  
• Have had a rash or allergic reaction to either Modafinil or armodafinil

Date: 06/28/17  9.1.2  Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
Modafinil is a controlled substance as it can be abused and/or lead to 
dependence. Keep in a safe place to avoid misuse and abuse.  
9.1.3  In-vitro data suggests that Modafinil is a weak inducer of CYP3A activity in a 
concentration dependent manner and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of 
drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g. steroidal contraceptives, 
cyclosporine, midazolam, triazolam). Data also suggest that Modafinil is a weak 
inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 (warfarin and phenytoin). Moda finil is 
also a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19 and therefore may increase 
concentrations of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_75107] (e.g. phenytoin, diazepam, 
propranolol, omeprazole and clomipramine). Modafinil may interact with some 
CNS active drugs that PD pa tients may be using including certain tricyclic 
antidepressants (TCAs) (metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19) and selective serotonin 
uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6). Also concomitant 
administration of quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_75094].  A 
recent report of a large overdose did not result in serious harmful effects.21 
9.1.4  Adverse Events:  
The following serious adverse reactions have been reported in  the FDA approved 
label for Modafinil and will be monitored for including:  
• serious rash (0.8%) including Stevens -Johnson Syndrome  
• Angioedema and Anaphylaxis (one case reported out of 1595 patients)  
• multi -organ hypersensitivity reactions  
• persistent sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• psychiatric symptoms (0.3% including: mania, delusions, suicidal ideations, 
paranoid delusions, auditory hallucinations with doses of 600 mg/day ) 
• effect on ability to drive and use Machinery  
• cardiovascular events  (chest pain, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspn ea, ischemic T -wave

9.3 Definitions  
9.3.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal  laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to 
the intervention.  
9.3.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of adverse events  will be  graded as follows : 
Mild:  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities.  
Moderate:  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.  
Severe:  the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or 
significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
9.3.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical occurrence that  meets one  or more of the following criteria : 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  should 
be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is life -threatening.  
(the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).

24 
Version No.: 4 
Date: 06/28/17  [IP_ADDRESS]  Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_75095] ≥ 24 hours . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Is an important medical event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be 
considered for reporting as a serious adverse event . The event may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home; convulsions that m ay not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.  
9.4 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the adverse event .  
 
Step 2: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol  therapy .  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
Step 3:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpec ted, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not 
listed in:  
• the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this 
protocol;  
• the drug package insert;  
 
Step 4 :  Determine whether the adverse event is a Serious Adverse Event  
9.5 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
9.5.1  Expedited Reporting  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] 24 hours of learning of any 
serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study .  
• The IRB must be notified  within 10 business days of any unanticipated 
problems involving ri sk to subjects or others” ( UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] ).  A UPI[INVESTIGATOR_75096], event or new information that is:  
1. Unanticipated or unexpected;  
2. Related to the research; and  
3. Involves new or increased risks to subjects or others.

25 
Version No.: 4 
Date: 06/28/17  • The FDA should be notified within 7 business days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_75097] -threatening adverse event with possible relationship 
to study drug, and 15 business days of the Sponsor learning of any event 
that is considered: 1) serious, 2) unexpected, and 3) at least possibly 
related to study participa tion. 
9.5.2  Routine Reporting  
• All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related to the study participation - are to be reported annually 
as part of regular data submission.  
9.[ADDRESS_81591]’s source document .

1. Experiences an intolerable adverse event  (see section 6.3) ;  
2. Develops a clinically sig nificant laboratory or ECG abnormality;  
3. Develops an allergic or anaphylactoid reaction to the medication;  
4. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75098]/or severity of 
adverse events justify discontinuation of the study   
10.[ADDRESS_81593] to estimate the how the study groups differ in their mean change from baseline.  A two 
group repeated measures linear model will be employed to determine significance for within each 
group and then to compare among the groups. Significance will be declared at the 5% level of 
significance and Bonferroni methods will be used for multiple comparisons.  This analysis 
approach will be applied to the primary and secondary responses . 
 
The stud y calls for [ADDRESS_81594] in excess of 80% power to detect a 1.[ADDRESS_81595] deviation estimates from previous researchers in si milar settings,22 the FOG -
Q (the primary response) has a standard deviation of 3.58. This implies that we will have power to 
detect a 6.265 (1.75*3.58) unit difference among time point means at the 5% level of significance. 
Power calculations are from ‘Tables of Sample Sizes in the Analysis of Variance’ published by

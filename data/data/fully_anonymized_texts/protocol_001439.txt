A. SPECIFIC AIMS: 
The following hypothesis  will be tested in this study:
1. Fecal  microbiota transplantation is a safe, tolerable and efficacious procedure.
2. The  fecal microbial diversity, composition and function in stool recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54987] a similar microbial diversity, composition and functionality as found in donor stool.
Primary objectives:  
1. To  determine the short term safety, tolerability and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation up to [ADDRESS_59472]-transplant in patients with
a. Recurrent  or refractory Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) not responsive to standard therapy in 
subjects without inflammatory bowel diseases 
b. Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responsive to standard therapy in subjects with inflammatory bowel 
disease.
c.   Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis without CDI who have required therapy beyond 5-ASA or 
mesalamine therapy alone 
Secondary objectives:
1. To  determine the long term safety, tolerability and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) up to 
one year post transplant in patients with
a. Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responsive to standard therapy in subjects without inflammatory 
bowel diseases 
b. Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responsive to standard therapy in subjects with inflammatory bowel 
disease.
c.   Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis without CDI who have required therapy beyond 5-ASA or 
mesalamine therapy alone
 
2. To  compare microbial diversity, composition and function in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54988] (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) with 
a. Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responsive to standard therapy in subjects without inflammatory 
bowel diseases 
b.  Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responsive to standard therapy in subjects with inflammatory bowel 
disease.

5. Stool  calprotectin levels will be measured in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54991]-FMT, [ADDRESS_59475] Kids’ Inpatient Database (HCUP-KID), there has been an increase in pediatric Clostridium difficile from 
a rate of 7.24/[ZIP_CODE] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54992] 1997 to 12.80/[ADDRESS_59476]-line treatments such as metronidazole and vancomycin are 
encountering “hypervirulent” and resistant strains of C. difficile such as North American Pulsed Field type 1 
(NAP1), restriction-endonuclease analysis (REA) type BI, or polymerase-chain reaction ribotype 027 (referred to 
collectively as the NAP1/B1/027 strain).6 The NAP1/B1/027 strain of C. difficile  has been deemed “hypervirulent” 
for its ability to produce binary toxin C. difficile [ADDRESS_59477] to the clinical 
resolution of acute diarrheal disease due to C. difficile.6 The problem is that after completing antibiotic treatment 
20-35% of CDI patients experience a recurrence of CDI.  Vancomycin tapers or fidaxomicin may be associated 
with a lower rate of recurrence.  Once recurrent CDI occurs, 45-65% of patients will continue to experience 
recurrent infections over several years and have a higher mortality.7-11 
Fecal microbial  transplantation (FMT) of healthy donor stool into the patient’s gut has emerged as one of 
the most effective treatments of recurrent CDI.12-14  Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), particularly 
ulcerative colitis  (UC) and indeterminate colitis (IC) but also Crohn’s disease (CD), are at increased risk of

recurrent CDI.25 
Colonoscopic instillation  into the right side of the colon of ~[ADDRESS_59479] rates 
of preventing further CDI (~90%).  The effectiveness of the oral capsule route, may be related to the total amount 
of stool ingested and ranges from 68 to greater than 90%.39-41  In a very recent randomized trial of oral capsule 
vs. colonic instillation of 150g of stool, ingestion of oral capsules was not inferior to colonoscopic administration 
(96% in both arms).41 
FMT is believed to restore  the normal microbiological balance in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54994], although there is some evidence that non-microbial molecular 
components, such as short-chain fatty acids and bile acids may also play a role.42,43  The normal microbiological 
balance may be perturbed in patients with C. difficile infection and or IBD.44
The overall  goal of this study protocol registered as ClinicalTrials.gov ID:[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 479696, is to 
better define the microbial and non-microbial components in donor stool that contribute to post-FMT changes in 
the microbiome in the following three groups of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:
a. Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responding to standard medical treatment without IBD, 
b. Recurrent  or refractory CDI not responding to standard medical therapy with IBD 
c. Ulcerative  colitis or indeterminate colitis without CDI who have required therapy beyond 5-ASA or 
mesalamine therapy alone 
D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
 
1. Rationale/overview:
It is  important to emphasize that this study is not designed to investigate clinical efficacy. FMT clinical 
efficacy for preventing further recurrence of CDI is now well established in the literature for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54995], with and without IBD.  However 
it remains to be determined what the key microbial or nonmicrobial components of the donor stool 
contribute to clinical efficacy.  Consequently this study is designed to:
a. Measure  baseline microbial imbalances in these three groups of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (i. recurrent or refractory 
CDI not responding to standard medical treatment without IBD, ii. recurrent or refractory CDI not 
responding to standard medical therapy with IBD iii. UC and IC without CDI.) compared to healthy 
donors.
b. Measure  whether FMT will alter recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54996] 12 weeks after the 
procedure.
c. Measure  short (12 weeks) and long term (one year) safety, tolerability and efficacy of FMT in these 
three groups of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
2. FDA statement  on requirement for IND for FMT.
The March  [ADDRESS_59480] 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54997]45 states: “We, FDA or Agency, are informing members of the 
medical and scientific community and other interested persons that we intend to exercise enforcement 
discretion under limited conditions, regarding the investigational new drug (IND) requirements for the use 
of fecal microbiota for transplantation (FMT) to treat Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection not 
responding to standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. FDA intends to exercise this discretion, provided that: 1) the licensed 
health care provider treating the patient obtains adequate consent from the patient or his or her legally 
authorized representative for the use of FMT products. The consent should include, at a minimum, a 
statement that the use of FMT products to treat C. difficile is investigational and a discussion of its 
reasonably foreseeable risks; 2) the FMT product is not obtained from a stool bank; and 3) the stool 
donor and stool are qualified by [CONTACT_55137]. A stool 
bank is defined, for the purpose of this guidance, as an establishment that collects, prepares, and stores 
FMT product for distribution to other establishments, health care providers, or other entities for use in 
patient therapy or clinical research. An establishment that collects or prepares FMT products solely under 
the direction of licensed health care providers for the purpose of treating their patients (e.g., a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54998]) is not considered to be a stool bank under this guidance. FDA does not intend to extend 
Approved: 7/25/2019
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: 7/1/2020
Stony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB)
July [ADDRESS_59481] to investigators for administration to subjects in accordance 
with the investigational plan under the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(3)) and [ADDRESS_59482] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. (See 21 CFR 312.10). FDA 
has developed this policy to assure that patients with C. difficile infection not responding to standard 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_54999], while addressing and controlling the risks that centralized 
manufacturing in stool banks presents to subjects. FDA intends for this to be an interim policy, while the 
Agency develops a comprehensive approach for the study and use of FMT products under IND.” At this 
time, since administration of FMT products from stool bank(s) has not been approved by [CONTACT_55138][INVESTIGATOR_307], administration of FMT products 
from stool banks cannot be offered to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55000].  
An IND (IND [ZIP_CODE])  was obtained from the FDA for performing FMT on UC and IC recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55001].
3. Research  Site(s):
The following research  sites are all located within Stony Brook University Medical Center (SBUMC).
a. Patient  and donor recruitment and screening. This will take place at Stony Brook University Medical 
Center (SBUMC) in both the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55002].  The Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic is located at [ADDRESS_59483]. Li’s laboratory within the Department of Medicine/Division of Gastroenterology research space 
located in in the Health Sciences Center Building (room HSC T17-080).  The research laboratory 
in the HSC Building is connected by a bridge to Stony Brook University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], allowing for rapid 
transport of the stool instillate to the Endoscopy unit on the 14th floor.
c. Colonoscopic  instillation of donor stool. Colonoscopic administration of the FMT will be performed 
in the Stony Brook University Endoscopy Unit located 
d. Processing  of stool samples for microbiome analysis.  The research stools samples obtained from 
the donor (at the time of transplant), and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (pre-FMT, [ADDRESS_59484]-FMT) will be processed in [CONTACT_55209]’s laboratory within the Department of Medicine/Division of

they consent to provide research samples and dietary information, they will be instructed on how to 
collect the research stool samples, complete the daily food diary one week prior to the FMT samples, 
reminded to stop antibiotics 48 h before the procedure.  The colonoscopic FMT procedure will be 
scheduled with colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_55030], so as to allow for donor screening results to be sent

with a complete history and physical to ascertain eligibility.  The donor will be consented to participate 
in the study, which requires undergoing stool and serological testing to assess for infectious 
pathogens that may theoretically be passed from the donor to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. The donor (as well as the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) will sign an acknowledgement form that if medical insurance does not cover the costs of 
these tests, the costs of the donor screening tests will be borne by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_55060] (Appendix 
N).  (The study team is in the process of applying for research grant funding that will cover the costs 
of donor screening for pathogens, but currently there are no research funds available to cover these 
costs). Once the donor has consented to the study, the donor will be instructed on collecting the stool 
to be used for the transplant, completing the one week food diary prior to providing the sample.  [CONTACT_55211] or [CONTACT_55210] will order the following laboratory tests for the donor to complete before the 
colonoscopic FMT is performed:
Stool tests :
C.  difficile toxin PCR (CPT [ZIP_CODE]) 
Routine  stool culture screen (CPT [ZIP_CODE]) - includes Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, 
Sorbitol negative E. coli or E. coli O157-H7 (Shiga toxin)
Giardia  Ag EIA (CPT [ZIP_CODE])
Modified  acid fast stain of stool (CPT [ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE]) Cryptosporidia, Cyclospora, 
Ova  and parasite with trichrome (CPT [ZIP_CODE]) includes Isospora
Vancomycin-resistant  enterococci (VRE), (CPT [ZIP_CODE])
Extended  spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL), (CPT [ZIP_CODE])
Carbapenem-resistant  Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) ,(CPT [ZIP_CODE])
Methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), (CPT [ZIP_CODE])
Blood tests :
HIV type  1 and type 2 screen (CPT [ZIP_CODE]/[ZIP_CODE])
Acute  Viral Hepatitis Panel: Hepatitis A IgM, Hepatitis Bs Ag, Hepatitis Bc IgM, Hepatitis C Ab

Syphilis  Rapid Plasma Reagin or RPR (CPT [ZIP_CODE]) 
Fluorescence  Treponemal Ab or FTA-Abs (CPT [ZIP_CODE])
Tuberculosis  (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold) (CPT [ZIP_CODE])
The laboratory  test results must be dated within [ADDRESS_59510] information for the donor’s PCP to forward the test results 
to.  The donor will be counseled to follow up with PCP to discuss the test results and the need for any 
further testing or treatment.

the procedure, and has avoided ingesting any of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s food allergens during the week prior 
to the transplant (see Appendix O).
d. 1-day  before FMT – initiate collection of donor stool.  The donor will have been given two stool 
collection kits at the  initial clinic visit.  The donor is instructed to collect one stool within [ADDRESS_59511] the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55062] 2 h before the FMT 
procedure is scheduled.
e. Day  of FMT. – Collection and evaluation of donor stool
Preprocedure. The  donor (or the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55063]) will deliver the stools to the 
Endoscopy Suite  for the research study team to pi[INVESTIGATOR_55064] [ADDRESS_59512] Form (Appendix P) either face to 
face or by [CONTACT_55146], to make sure no donor exclusions apply, prior to processing 
the stool to prepare the stool infusate, as described in the next section. 
ii. Protocol  for preparation of donor stool infusate for colonoscopic infusion. 
The donor stool  (refrigerated not frozen) is transported by [CONTACT_55147]. Li’s laboratory and 
processed for infusion via colonoscopy following standard operating procedures as previously 
described:44
Stool  preparation will occur in the biological safety hood
Universal  precautions will be adhered to. Those involved with mixing and/or handling the fecal 
transfusion material will wear a fluid-resistant gown, gloves, and mask with goggles, or eye shield 
Donor  stool will be transferred to a single-use disposable container
Preservative-free  normal saline (250-500 mL) at room temperature will be used to dilute the stool 
sample until it reaches a liquid slurry consistency
The  stool slurry will then be filtered to remove as much particulate matter as possible. This will be 
accomplished using gauze pads lining the inside portion of a plastic disposable funnel
The  filtered stool slurry will be divided into aliquots of 50 mL and will be used within an hour of 
preparation
iii. Protocol  for Processing and Analysis of Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55065]: As noted in sections [ADDRESS_59513] agreed to provide clinical data, blood and stool 
samples are consented under a separate consent under a separate IRB ((IRB net ID: 163184-15) for 
collection and storage of samples within the Stony Brook GI satellite Biobank, which operates as a 
module under the Stony Brook Biobank [LOCATION_001] State License for Biobanking.  The clinical data, 
stripped of patient health identifiers, will be assigned a patient ID and a visit ID and will be stored in 
the Stony Brook University Digestive Diseases Research Tissue Procurement Facility clinical 
database.  The patient samples will also be stripped of patient health identifiers and assigned a 
patient ID, visit ID and sample ID and will be archived within the Stony Brook University GI Biobank.  
The analysis of the samples and downstream products will including the following:
a. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_55066].  DNA will be extracted from peripheral mononuclear blood cells 
(in blood) as  previously described in [CONTACT_55209]’s laboratory.[ADDRESS_59514] effective means of obtaining accurate genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_55067]. If we submit the samples for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_55068], each of

July [ADDRESS_59515] tier of microbiome surveillance 
and will  measure taxa based microbial diversity and composition.43 This may involve shippi[INVESTIGATOR_55069] (University of Colorado).  If 
we submit these DNA samples to outside institutions for analysis, each of these samples will be 
assigned another sample ID, to further protect the privacy of the subjects, prior to submission of 
these samples  to an outside facility.  For all rRNA sequence datasets, we routinely screen for 
and remove  contaminating human DNA/RNA sequences by [CONTACT_55148]2 read-mappi[INVESTIGATOR_55070]; thus,  no human sequences will be analyzed beyond this step or will be included in 
public repositories.   We propose to measure the alterations in microbial diversity and composition 
before and after fecal microbial transplantation.  
c. Targeted  qPCR sequencing . To detect targeted microbial taxa and functions we will utilize 
targeted qPCR and reverse  transcriptase qPCR. These analyses will be carried out in [CONTACT_55209]’s 
and [CONTACT_55212]’s laboratory.46  
d. Fecal calprotectin.  Fecal  calprotectin is a marker of intestinal inflammation that will complement 
the colonoscopic  scores and patient questionnaires.  We propose to measure fecal calprotectin 
in each of the collected stools using the PhiCal commercial ELISA kit (CALPRO, Oslo, Norway) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions within [CONTACT_55209]’s laboratory. Frozen stools archived at
 -80oC will be batch extracted and analyzed along with the manufacturer’s control to avoid 
interassay variability.
e. Shotgun  metagenomics, bacterial metatranscriptomics, fecal metabolomics, fecal proteomic.  We 
propose to  conduct multiple omic studies on microbial function using the collected stool samples 
if we are successful in obtaining outside funding to support these studies.  This may require 
sending aliquots of samples or their downstream products to other institutions for analysis.  If so, 
the samples will be assigned another sample ID to further protect the privacy of the subjects 
before shippi[INVESTIGATOR_55071].  For all meta-omic sequence datasets, 
we routinely screen for and remove contaminating human DNA/RNA sequences by [CONTACT_55149]2 read-mappi[INVESTIGATOR_55072]; thus, no human sequences will be analyzed beyond this step or 
will be included in public repositories.
E.  STATISTICS:
The number  of patients enrolled will not be limited since a primary goal of this study is to establish safety, 
tolerability and efficacy of FMT.  It is anticipated that data from 80 FMTs with a balanced design of 20 FMTs 
performed on each of the following four groups of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (CDI without IBD, CDI with UC, CDI with CD, and 
UC without CDI) associated with this IRB protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov ID:[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 479696, IND for UC only 
[ZIP_CODE]), in combination with data from 20 FMTs performed on CD without CDI recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55073] a 
sister protocol (IRB 973349-5, ClinicalTrials.Gov ID [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], IND16795) will be needed to generate a 
power analysis on the multi-omic datasets.  A linear mixed model will used to compare alpha-diversity 
(ShannonH) and beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distance) between each time point (donor, pre-FMT, [ADDRESS_59516]-FMT) and each disease group as previously described.[ADDRESS_59517] interaction term, 
Group*FMT, will be used to estimate the differences between any two time points within a specific disease group. 
Covariance structure to model correlation among measurements from the same patient and his/her 
corresponding donor will be selected based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).  Possible covariance structures 
to model correlation among longitudinal measurement from the same patient and measurement in the 
corresponding donor included unstructured (UN), compound symmetry (CS), Toeplitz (TOEP), Heterogeneous 
CS (CSH) and Heterogeneous TOEP (HTOEP). Using the two-way interaction term between Group and FMT, 
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMIX) will be used to examine the possible change in individual OTU 
relative abundance after FMT in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55074]. The 
actual counts of each OTU will be assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution.47 The log-transformed 
overall sequence count for each individual at each time point will be considered as an offset. In case that there 
is model converging issue GLMMIX, generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be used. In GEE, the 
dependence structure was chosen based on Quasi Information Criteria (QIC). The p-values from comparison 
analysis of all OTUs will adjusted for multiple comparisons by [CONTACT_55150]-
Hochberg method  (FDR < 0.05). Principal coordinate analyses will be carried out using the R package vegan.

12Similar models  will be used to examine the difference in the expression level of a specific gene or protein 
based on metatranscriptomic data and metabolomic data between recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55075].  Beyond analysis of individual data-types integr-omic analyses that combine all data types 
(i.e. metabolomics, microbiome, and clinical) will rely on the use of Similarity Network Fusion,47 which performs 
unsupervised clustering of patients based on each datatype and then fuses the obtained networks, strengthening 
links in complementary networks. These analyses will reveal the relationships among taxonomic composition, 
microbiome diversity and function and metabolomics which implies the mechanism how FMT works. All analysis 
will be performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R 3.4.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria).
F. FUNDING STATUS,  DETAILS:
There is  currently no funding for the procedure or evaluation of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55076], or the laboratory 
screening of the donor.  The Simons Foundation Award is currently used to cover the costs of processing, 
sequencing and analysis of stool and blood samples.

symptoms.
The potential  benefits of having the fecal transplantation for treatment of UC or IC without CDI is 
improvement in their IBD symptoms.
Conducting research on  these samples, including the research proposed in this application may create new 
tests, treatments, or cures. If it does the subjects (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55089]) who have donated samples will not 
receive any money from those products.
4. Importance  of the Knowledge to be Gained:
This study will  enable us to contribute to the literature regarding the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of fecal 
microbiota transplantation. Additionally, by [CONTACT_55152], future integrations of the 
microbiome data not only with phenotype but also with genetic data and metabolomics data will be possible. 
This will enable further studies investigating the mechanism(s) by [CONTACT_55153]/or ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis.

Dear -
Thank you  for your interest. I am referring you to 
(IF ADULT  RECIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16139]) [CONTACT_55213], Professor of Medicine/Gastroenterology,Stony Brook Medicine  
(IF PEDIATRIC  RECIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16139]) [CONTACT_55210], Chief and Professor of Pediatrics/ Gastroenterology, Stony 
Brook Medicine.
We are  currently open to enrollment and accept local and out-of-state candidates.
However, we  need your gastroenterologist to be on board with this study, which is strictly observational 
and simply  asking if we can change your microbiome. In addition, we need you to select a healthy donor 
who fulfills the  attached screening criteria. The evaluation of both the patient (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55100]) 
and donor  takes place at Stony Brook Medicine, NY.  So, this requires two trips to Stony Brook.  One for 
the initial  recruitment and the second for the colonoscopic delivery of the transplant.  We do not cover 
travel costs,  donor screening costs or the cost of the colonoscopy (usually covered by [CONTACT_55163]). However,  costs of analyzing the stools for all microbiome-related studies will be 
covered by  [CONTACT_3019].
We prefer  no change in your medications and no biologic therapy for at least [ADDRESS_59531] office visit note 
should be  sent to us via fax 
(IF ADULT  RECIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16139]) ([PHONE_977]) ATTN: DR. ELLEN LI or email: 
[EMAIL_1029]
(IF PEDIATRIC  RECIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16139]) ([PHONE_976]) ATTN: DR. ANUPAMA CHAWLA or email: 
[EMAIL_1030]
It should  also include the most recent colonoscopy, pathology and imaging reports.
Please see  the attached documents, which you can share with your gastroenterologist.

Co-Investigators:  Ellen Li, MD PhD
Departments:  Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Medicine/Gastroenterology
When we say “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and 
other staff. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, permission from you is required and the assent (agreement) of your child may be required.
You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study. You are encouraged to take your time 
in making your decision. You may want to discuss this study with your friends and family. PURPOSE The purpose of this study is:
•To determine the safety and tolerability of fecal (stool) transplantation to treat Ulcerative 
colitis or indeterminate colitis. 
•Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease affecting the colon without a medical cure. The 
precise cause of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as UC, Crohn’s disease, or indeterminate colitis is unclear, however, genetics and the environment are thought to play a role. Studies have found that patients with UC  have a decreased prevalence of protective 
bacteria and an increase in harmful bacteria in the colon. Inflammation in the colon in these 
patients is thought to be due to this imbalance between helpful and harmful bacteria. Currently, the treatment of IBD includes steroids, anti-inflammatory medications and biological therapy, each with its own side effe cts. Given the role of the gastrointestinal 
bacteria in driving inflammation in patients with IBD, treatments that manipulate these bacteria have been investigated, including the use of medications containing beneficial bacteria (probiotics), with some benefit. Fecal transplantation (FMT), the transfer of gastrointestinal bacteria (microbiota) from a healthy donor via infusion of a liquid stool suspension, is proving to be an effective alternative treatment for medication-resistant UC or indeterminate colitis. The goal of this method is to remove the harmful bacteria in the colon and replace them with normal bacteria.Approved: 7/3/2019

Stony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB)
Page [ADDRESS_59544] found that this transplantation is helpful in improving the symptoms associated with IBD such as abdominal  pain and diarrhea. This study hopes to document 
fecal transplant’s safety, tolerability and effectiveness and improve or even eliminate your 
symptoms by [CONTACT_55164]-up routinely with you for one year. We will perform stool and genetic studies on you to see if the bacteria in your colon really did change after the transplantation and if any of your genes influence the composition of your colon bacteria. 
We expect to enroll a minimum of 100 patients in this study at Stony Brook University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
PROCEDURES 
If you decide to be in this study, your part will involve: 
•You will first have to choose somebody who will donate the stool which will be 
transplanted. The donor can be anyone who we will consent separately and who meets eligibility criteria to donate stool. He/she will be asked questions and screened by [CONTACT_55165]/she is a healthy candidate for stool transplantation. We will not share the lab results of your donor specimen with you even if they fail the inclusion criteria. 
•After the donor is chosen and he/she meets criteria to donate stool, we will give you a date for the fecal transplantation which will be done during a colonoscopy.
•If you are of child-bearing age, a pregnancy test will be given to you as a clinic standard of care before the colonoscopy procedure. If the test result is positive for pregnancy then we will not perform the fecal transplantation colonoscopy.
•During the week before fecal transplantation, we will ask you to record everything you have 
eaten on a diet record which we will provide to you. Stool for research will be collected 1-3 
days before your day of fecal transplantation.
•On the day before your transplant, you will be given instructions for a bowel prep to clean out your colon completely so it can be visualized well when we perform the fecal transplantation and make the procedure more effective. For the last [ADDRESS_59545] nothing to eat or drink.
•On the day of the transplantation, you will arrive at Stony Brook University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55117], located on the 14th Floor. There you will change into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55118] (IV) will be placed to provide you with fluids and sedation during the colonoscopy. Four teaspoons of blood will be taken for research, to perform genetic studies.
•Your donor’s stool will be prepared and while you are properly sedated the stool will be 
instilled into your colon.Approved: 7/3/2019

Page 3 of 9•At the time of scope and transplant, if the scope reveals anything clinically suspect that 
might require  a biopsy, or the physician decides that the colon is healthy enough, then the 
transplant will not be done.
•You will stay in the Endoscopy Suite, lying on your right side, for at least one hour. This is to 
maximize contact [CONTACT_55166]. If you are not cleared to depart after one hour, you will stay until the anesthesiologist (doctor who administered sedation during colonoscopy) does clear you to depart. You will be able to eat and drink right after you wake up and can resume normal activities as soon as the anesthesia wears off and you feel well.
•You will receive a phone call the day after the procedure, and  be asked various questions to 
determine your general well-being.
•You will then receive weekly phone calls for 12 weeks at a convenient time for you, to ask you further general well-being questions.
•You will keep another diet record during the first week post-transplant. [ADDRESS_59546] stool for research, similar to how you collected stool prior to your stool transplantation.
•You will keep another diet record during the [ADDRESS_59547] stool for research, similar to how you collected stool prior to your stool transplantation. 
•After your 12-week stool collection and testing you will receive monthly phone calls until 
one year after the transplant to determine your general well-being.
•If you are diagnosed with bacteria in your blood within past 4 weeks (28 days) of intended 
FMT, you will be excluded from the study.
When you are first recruited for the study, you w ill be assigned a coded number. Stool and blood 
samples collected from you and follow-up questionnaires will all have your coded number so your 
information will not be directly linked to your samples and medical or diet diary information.
RISKS / DISCOMFORTS The following risks/discomforts may occur as a result of you being in this study: 
•Although donor stool is vigorously screened for infectious agents, there is a still a rare risk 
of an infection with harmful bacteria and multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) being 
passed from the donor’s stool to you. MDRO are common bacteria that have developed resistance to multiple types of antibiotics. These bacteria are present on the bodies of some people and they can co-exist with normal bacteria and cause no symptoms (“commensal”) or lead to serious infection spreading to the blood and other organs (“invasive”). Invasive infection is more common in patients with compromised immunity. Infections caused by [CONTACT_55167], death and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Measures have been implemented for donor screening (exclude donors at higher risk of MDRO infection) and donor stool testing (exclude stool that tests positive for MDRO)Approved: 7/3/2019

Page 4 of 9•Uncommon risks associated with fecal transplantation that have been documented in the 
literature include crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fullness, passing gas, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and blood in the stool. Since this is a research study, not all risks associated with fecal transplantation are known at this time; there may be unforeseen risks associated with study participation. 
•There are risks associated with colonoscopy: infection, bleeding, and less than a 1% chance 
of a perforation or hole being created (A separate consent form for colonoscopy will be given on the day of fecal transplantation). 
•Your colitis may progress or get worse after the transplantation.
•When your blood is drawn, temporary pain and bruising where the needle enters the skin, 
and sometimes, fainting and/or infection. 
•There is a rare possibility that confidential information about you may be accidentally 
disclosed. 
•Some of the research that will be done on your blood are genetic studies. The genetic 
studies are only for research, and will not be us ed in making decisions about your care. We 
will not contact [CONTACT_55168]. 
BENEFITS 
The following benefits may occur as a result of being in this study: The potential direct benefit of performing fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of 
ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis is improvement or resolution of symptoms associated with 
having inflammatory bowel disease such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, poor appetite and minimizing the need for stronger medications that have their own associated side effects. 
The indirect benefits include contributions to our  knowledge regarding the safety and tolerability
of fecal microbiota transplantation. Additionally, by [CONTACT_55169], as well as performing genetic studies, we hope to see if there is a link between genetics and colonic bacteria as well as determine the relative abundance of each 
bacterium. This will also enable us to see if performing the stool transplant changed the 
composition of your stool and may one day lead to creating medications that increase healthy bacteria in the colon or target harmful bacteria.

PURPOSE 
The purpose  of this study is:
To determine  the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of fecal (stool) transplantation to 
treat Clostridium difficile infection. 
Clostridium difficile  is a bacteria that can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea which is often 
bloody. This can lead to not absorbing nutrients from food properly, becoming anemic, and 
feeling tired. In severe cases, patients have to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55123], antibiotics, or to treat their pain. Patients may even require colon 
surgery if the bacteria causes intractable pain and diarrhea or leads to a hole being created 
in the colon. It is also the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with increasing 
infection rates. The bacteria is usually treated with antibiotics such as metronidazole 
(Flagyl) or vancomycin, however these antibiotics do not work all the time due to resistant 
strains of Clostridium difficile. When a person is infected with these bacteria, he/she has a 
high percentage of this bacteria compared to all the other normal bacteria which are usually 
found in their colon. Fecal transplantation (FMT), the transfer of gastrointestinal bacteria 
(microbiota) from a healthy donor via infusion of a liquid stool suspension, is proving to be 
an effective alternative treatment for antibiotic-resistant Clostridium difficile . The goal of 
this method is to remove the harmful bacteria such as Clostridium difficile in the colon and

After  the donor is chosen and he/she meets criteria to donate stool, we will give you a date 
for the fecal transplantation which will be done during a colonoscopy.
If  you are of child-bearing age, a pregnancy test will be given to you as a clinic standard of 
care before the colonoscopy procedure. If the test result is positive for pregnancy then we 
will not perform the fecal transplantation colonoscopy.
During  the week before fecal transplantation, we will ask you to record everything you have 
eaten on a diet record which we will provide to you. Stool for research will be collected 1-3 
days before your day of fecal transplantation.
On  the day before your transplant, you will be given instructions for a bowel prep to clean 
out your colon completely so it can be visualized well when we perform the fecal 
transplantation and make the procedure more effective. For the last [ADDRESS_59553] nothing to eat or drink.
On  the day of the transplantation, you will arrive at Stony Brook University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55124], located on the 14th Floor. There you will change into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55125] (IV) will be placed to provide you with fluids and sedation 
during the colonoscopy. Four teaspoons of blood will be taken for research, to perform 
genetic studies.

instilled into your colon.
At the  time of scope and transplant, if the scope reveals anything clinically suspect that 
might require  a biopsy, or the physician decides that the colon is healthy enough, then the 
transplant will not be done.
You  will stay in the Endoscopy Suite, lying on your right side, for at least one hour. This is to 
maximize contact [CONTACT_55166]. If you are not cleared to 
depart after one hour, you will stay until the anesthesiologist (doctor who administered 
sedation during colonoscopy) does clear you to depart. You will be able to eat and drink 
right after you wake up and can resume normal activities as soon as the anesthesia wears 
off and you feel well.
You  will receive a phone call the day after the procedure, and be asked various questions to 
determine your general well-being.

you further general well-being questions.
You  will keep another diet record during the first week post-transplant. [ADDRESS_59554] stool for research, similar to how you collected stool 
prior to your stool transplantation.
If  symptoms of Clostridium difficile  infection reappear after your stool transplant, you will 
be asked to provide a stool sample to a laboratory to check for Clostridium difficile bacteria.
You  will keep another diet record during the 12th week post-transplant. [ADDRESS_59555] stool for research, similar to how you collected stool 
prior to your stool transplantation. 
After  your 12-week stool collection and testing you will receive monthly phone calls until 
one year after the transplant to determine your general well-being.
If  your doctor feels it would benefit you, s/he may recommend performing an additional 
transplant at some point during this study.
If  you are diagnosed with bacteria in your blood within past 4 weeks (28 days) of intended 
FMT, you will be excluded from the study.
When you are first recruited for  the study, you will be assigned a coded number. Stool and blood 
samples collected from you and follow-up questionnaires will all have your coded number so your 
information will not be directly linked to your samples and medical or diet diary information.
RISKS /  DISCOMFORTS 
The following  risks/discomforts may occur as a result of you being in this study: 
Although  donor stool is vigorously screened for infectious agents, there is a still a rare risk 
of an infection with harmful bacteria and multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) being 
passed from the donor’s stool to you. MDRO are common bacteria that have developed 
resistance to multiple types of antibiotics. These bacteria are present on the bodies of some

or lead to serious infection spreading to the blood and other organs (“invasive”). Invasive 
infection is more common in patients with compromised immunity. Infections caused by 
[CONTACT_55167], death and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Measures 
have been implemented for donor screening (exclude donors at higher risk of MDRO 
infection) and donor stool testing (exclude stool that tests positive for MDRO)
Uncommon  risks associated with fecal transplantation that have been documented in the 
literature include crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fullness, passing gas, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and 
blood in the stool. Since this is a research study, not all risks associated with fecal 
transplantation are known at this time; there may be unforeseen risks associated with study 
participation. 
There  are risks associated with colonoscopy: infection, bleeding, and less than a 1% chance 
of a perforation or hole being created (A separate consent form for colonoscopy will be 
given on the day of fecal transplantation). 
If  you have Inflammatory Bowel Disease, it may progress or get worse after the 
transplantation. 
When  your blood is drawn, temporary pain and bruising where the needle enters the skin, 
and sometimes, fainting and/or infection. 
There  is a rare possibility that confidential information about you may be accidentally 
disclosed. 
Some of the  research that will be done on your blood are genetic studies. The genetic 
studies are only for research, and will not be used in making decisions about your care. We 
will not contact [CONTACT_55168]. 
If  you have an additional fecal transplant, the same risks (as above) will again apply. 
BENEFITS 
The following  benefits may occur as a result of being in this study: 
The potential  direct benefits to you of having the fecal transplantation for treatment of Clostridium 
difficile is improvement in your diarrhea, abdominal pain, and eradication of the Clostridium 
difficile bacteria. The indirect benefits include contributions to our knowledge regarding the safety, 
efficacy and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation. Additionally, by [CONTACT_55177], as well as performing genetic studies, we hope to see 
if there is a link between genetics and colonic bacteria, as well as determine the relative abundance 
of each bacterium. This will also enable us to see if performing the stool transplant changed the 
composition of your stool and may one day lead to creating medications that increase healthy 
bacteria in the colon or target harmful bacteria.

As fecal  transplant for the treatment of Clostridium difficile  is now considered standard of 
care, we will obtain a prior authorization for colonoscopy to perform the transplant from 
your insurance company if needed. You may have to pay for a portion of the colonoscopy 
depending on your insurance plan. We encourage you to contact [CONTACT_55179].
All  stool tests and bloodwork for research purposes will be performed without any cost to 
you for participating in this study. 
ALTERNATIVES
An alternative to  performing the fecal microbiota transplantation is administration of 
additional antibiotics, some of which may have already been ineffective or trying 
combinations of different antibiotics that may or may not work in eradicating the disease.
The  other alternative to performing the fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium 
difficile is living with abdominal pain and diarrhea associated with this disease , which can 
eventually lead to malabsorption problems, anemia and potential for bowel perforation and 
need for surgery.
The  fecal microbial transplantation is approved as a treatment option by [CONTACT_55180]. You can get this treatment at any other facility in the [LOCATION_003] that

Stool  tests and bloodwork for research purposes will be performed without any cost to 
you for participating in this study.
Payments to  you:  You will not be paid for your participation in this study.
Risks/Discomforts:
Although  donor stool is checked for bad germs, there is a still a small chance of an 
infection being passed from the donor’s stool to you.
Uncommon  risks associated with fecal transplantation include crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], fullness, gas, 
bloating, diarrhea, fever and blood in the stool. Since this is a research study, not all 
risks associated with fecal transplantation are known at this time; there may be 
unknown risks associated with being in this study.
There  are risks associated with colonoscopy: infection, bleeding, and less than a 1% 
chance of a perforation or hole being created (A separate consent form for colonoscopy 
will be given on day of fecal transplantation).
If  you have Inflammatory Bowel Disease, it may get worse after the transplantation.

Benefits:  The potential direct benefits to you of having the fecal transplantation for treatment of 
Clostridium difficile is improvement in your diarrhea, abdominal pain, and eradication of the 
bacteria. 
The indirect benefits  include increased knowledge about the safety and effectiveness of fecal 
transplantation. Additionally, by [CONTACT_55186], 
as well as performing genetic studies, we hope to see if there is a link between genetics and colonic 
bacteria as well as determine the relative abundance of each bacteria. This will also help us see if 
performing the stool transplant changed the bacteria in your stool and may one day lead to 
creating medications that increase healthy bacteria in the colon or target harmful bacteria.

 DONOR  RESEARCH PERMISSION/CONSENT  FORM  (CDIFF/UC/IC)
Project Title:  Fecal microbial transplantation in patients with medication-refractory Clostridium 
difficile and/or Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_55116], MD
Co-Investigator:  Ellen  Li, MD PhD
Departments:  Pediatric  Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Medicine/Gastroenterology
When we say  “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the doctors and 
other staff. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, 
permission from you is required and the assent (agreement) of your child may be required.
You are  being asked to be a volunteer in a research study. You are encouraged to take your time 
in making your decision. You may want to discuss this study with your friends and family. 
PURPOSE 
The purpose  of this study is: 
To determine  the safety and tolerability of fecal (stool) transplantation to treat Clostridium 
difficile and/or Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis.
Ulcerative  colitis (UC) is a chronic disease affecting the colon, without a medical cure. The 
precise cause of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as UC, Crohn’s disease, or 
indeterminate colitis is unclear. However, genetics and the environment are thought to play 
a role. Studies have found that patients with UC have a decreased prevalence of protective 
bacteria and an increase in harmful bacteria in the colon. Inflammation in the colon in these 
patients is thought to be due to  this imbalance between helpful and harmful bacteria. 
Currently, the treatment of IBD includes steroids, anti-inflammatory medications and 
biological therapy, each with its own side effects. Given the role of the gastrointestinal 
bacteria in driving inflammation in patients with IBD, treatments that manipulate these 
bacteria have been investigated, including the use of medications containing beneficial 
bacteria (probiotics), with some benefit. Fecal transplantation (FMT), the transfer of 
gastrointestinal bacteria (microbiota) from a healthy donor via infusion of a liquid stool 
suspension, is proving to be an effective alternative treatment for medication-resistant UC

Page [ADDRESS_59569] them with normal bacteria.
Clostridium difficile  is a bacteria that can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea which is often 
bloody. This can lead to not absorbing nutrients from food properly, becoming anemic, and 
feeling tired. In severe cases, patients have to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55123], antibiotics, or to treat their pain. Patients may even require colon 
surgery if the bacteria causes intractable pain and diarrhea or leads to a hole being created 
in the colon. It is also the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, with increasing 
infection rates. The bacteria is usually treated with antibiotics such as metronidazole 
(Flagyl) or vancomycin. However, these antibiotics do not work all the time, due to resistant 
strains of Clostridium difficile. When a person is infected with these bacteria, he/she has a 
high percentage of these bacteria compared to  all the other normal bacteria which are 
usually found in their colon. Fecal transplantation is proving to be an effective alternative 
treatment for medication-resistant Clostridium difficile. The goal of this method is to 
remove the harmful bacteria such as Clostridium difficile in the colon and replace them with 
normal bacteria.
_______________________________(recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s  name) has one of these conditions and 
has named you as a potential stool donor so that the fecal transplantation can be 
performed. This study, hopes to document fecal transplant’s safety, tolerability and 
effectiveness and improve or even eliminate ___________________’s symptoms by

We  will perform stool studies on you to see if the bacteria in your colon really did change 
the composition of ___________________’s colonic bacteria. 
We expect to  enroll a minimum of 100 patients in this study at Stony Brook University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
PROCEDURES 
If you decide to  be in this study, your part will involve: 
Answering  a questionnaire to determine your eligibility to donate stool to the transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. 
If  you are eligible, you will be asked to have stool testing and blood work done in a 
laboratory to evaluate for infectious agents that may theoretically be transferred to the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55130]. 
If  all this testing is negative, then you and the stool recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55131] a date for the 
stool transplant and you will be told to avoid ____________________________ (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55132]) for up to one week before the transplant. 
During  the week before fecal transplantation, we will ask you to record everything you have 
eaten on a diet record which we will provide to you.

Page 3  of 7On  the night before or morning of fecal transplantation, you will be told to collect the stool 
using SaranTM Wrap, plastic hat, or a collection container. The stool will need to be collected 
prior to any contamination with the toilet bowl. The stool should then be kept in an airtight 
container which will be provided to you. 
The  stool may be kept at room temperature if used within [ADDRESS_59570] not be frozen. 
Stool  is to be transported from the home to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55133]. 
On  the day of transplant, you will come to Stony Brook University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Endoscopy 
Suite, located on the 14th Floor, and drop off the stool.  You will be asked if you had a fever 
in the previous 2 weeks or accidentally ingested _____________ (recipi[INVESTIGATOR_55113]) in the 
past week. 
When you are first recruited for  the study, you will be assigned a coded number. Stool samples 
collected from you will have your coded number, so your information will not be directly linked to 
your samples, medical or diet diary information.
RISKS /  DISCOMFORTS 
The following  risks/discomforts may occur as a result of you being in this study: 
When  your blood is drawn, temporary pain and bruising where the needle enters the skin, 
and sometimes, fainting and/or infection. 
As part  of the study, blood work to test for HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), Hepatitis B, 
Hepatitis C, and Syphilis will be performed. If these tests come back as positive, the results 
will be discussed with you in a confidential manner. If you do test positive for HIV infection, 
the importance of telling your sex or needle-sharing partners of possible exposure will be 
discussed. 
There  is a rare possibility that confidential information about you may be accidentally 
disclosed.

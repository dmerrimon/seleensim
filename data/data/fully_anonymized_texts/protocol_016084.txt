 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background Information  
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in the setting of congestive heart failure  (CHF)  is common , a marker 
of poor prognosis , and associated with accelerated mortality1,2,3. Currently available treatments 
targeted at secondary PH in CHF have not yielded positive results, which still leaves these patients 
with no productive therapy option today. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent and 
still largely under -diagnosed in CHF patients4. OSA is believed to have significant hemodynamic 
impact, which  may play a role in development of pulmonar y hypertension. Prior stud ies have 
shown that pulmonary pressures increase during sleep even in normal subjects5. In patients with 
OSA the PA pressures increase over different stages with a further spi[INVESTIGATOR_275681]6. The patho physiology  of pulmonary hypertension due to 
OSA is believed to be due to generation of significant intra -pleural negative pressures due to 
glottic closure and intermittent hypoxia causing pulmonary vasoconstriction6,7,8,9,10,[ADDRESS_336680] pressure ( APAP ) with fixed lower EPAP 
pressures may have a salutary effect on the  PA pressures  in the acute setting . 
We hypothesize that acute inpatient intervention with auto-adjusting  positive airway pressure 
therapy (APAP) in patients with decompensated CHF and OSA may significantly reduce PA 
pressures, and also reduce length of stay ( LOS) and NT-proBNP levels leading to improved patient 
outcome. With this approach APAP may offer a novel therapy option for these comorbid patients, 
desperately seeking for improvements in symptoms.  
4.2. Intended Use  
The AirSense™ 10  AutoSet ™ device is cleared for use by [CONTACT_275705]: 
The AirSense 10 AutoSet self -adjusting device is indicated for the treatment of obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) in patients weighing more than 66 lb (30 kg). It is intended for home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399].  
The humidifier is intended for single patient use in the home environment and re -use in a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/institutional environment.

The [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification14 provides a simple way of 
classifying the extent of heart failure. It places patients in one of four categories based on how 
much t hey are limited during physical activity; the lim itations/symptoms are in regard  to normal 
breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and or angina pain:  
NYHA Class  Symptoms  
I Cardiac disease, but no symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physic al 
activity, e.g. shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs etc.  
II Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight 
limitation during ordinary activity.  
ASAP -HF Clinical Study Protocol   FINAL VERSION 5/30/17  
20 
 III Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than -
ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20 –100 m).  
Comfortable only at rest.  
IV Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest . Mostly 
bedbound patients.  
NYHA Class determination should be performed by [CONTACT_275714]'s treatment group  once the subject has been randomized . 
10.2. Polygraphy  
Every subject in the study will undergo polygraphy  (including pulse oximetry) using ApneaLink Air 
at screening  while in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Data acquisition and analysis is described in the ApneaLink Systems 
Clinical Guide and data collection and the settings required for automatic scoring will be described 
in the Manual of Procedures . Completion of the test is defined as the time the report is  generated.  
10.3. AirSense [ADDRESS_336691] PAP therapy at the enrolling site for a comprehensive evaluation 
of systolic function , diastolic function and Doppler parameters. The primary echocardiographic 
endpoints are the change over time between treatment and control groups for the following 
parameters: Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), Right atrial pressures (RAP), Tricus pid 
regurgitation (TR)  jet, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) , and left ventricular systolic volume 
index (LVSVI) for subjects with reduced EF (HFrEF, LVEF <45%), and the ratio of transmitral Doppler 
early filling velocity to tissue Doppler early d iastolic mitral annular velocity determinant of mean 
left atrial pressure (E/e‘) in subjects with preserved EF (HFpEF, LVEF≥45%). Echocardiograms 
should be performed at the time of discontinuation of PAP therapy . 
10.5. Functional Capacity Testing  (6MWT ) 
The [ADDRESS_336692] (6MWT) serves as an objective evaluation of the response to medical 
intervention . The distance walked in 6 minutes (6MWD) on a hard, flat surface is measured. The 
6MWT  will be performed according to standard operating procedures specified fo r this protocol 
(see Manual of Procedures ). All subjects will be assessed for clinical stability immediately prior to 
ASAP -HF Clinical Study Protocol   FINAL VERSION 5/30/[ADDRESS_336693].  Exercise will be performed on a level 
indoor surface  following American Th oracic Society (ATS) guidelines in a way that minimizes 
variability . If there are any signs of medical instability, the attending physician will end the test 
before 6 minutes . 
10.6. Biomarker testing and specimen storage  
Blood will be collected and processed to obtain samples  for NTpro -BNP. All samples will be sent to 
the site’s local clinical laboratory for testing .  
11. SAFETY  
The investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects enrolled into the study at the  
study site. The investigator or qualified designee will enter the required initial and follow -up 
information regarding events on the appropriate eCRF within the EDC system. Investigators are 
responsible for following all serious adverse events (SAEs) unti l resolution, stabilization , or the 
event is otherwise explained , and to report serious adverse events as well as serious injury or 
death that were related to (caused by [CONTACT_275715]) the AirSense 10 AutoSet  study device  in 
accordance with their local  IRB/EC requirements. Investigators should follow usual clinical practice 
at their institutions for reporting serious events  to the regulatory authorities.   
11.1. Labeled Adverse Device Effects  
Expected adverse device events are determined to be mild and are rel ated to the interface (mask) 
between the AutoSet device and the subject. In this study any skin or eye irritation that is transient 
(ie, resolves within 24 hours following device use and requires no medical intervention), will not be 
classified as an adver se device effect.  
Mask   
 Mild skin irritation around the nose and forehead from the mask  
 Mild facial abrasions from ill -fitting mask interface  
 Eye irritation, caused by [CONTACT_275716]  
 Drying of the nose, mouth, or  throat  
 Nosebleed  
 Bloating  
 Ear or sinus discomfort  
 Eye irritation  
 Skin rashes  
12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Descriptive summaries including m edians, 25th and 75th percentiles will be presented for continuous 
variables; the number and frequency of subjects  in each category will be presented for nominal 
ASAP -HF Clinical Study Protocol   FINAL VERSION 5/30/17  
22 
 variables.  Statistical tests with a two-sided p-value <0.[ADDRESS_336694] of continuous APAP treatment  on both the primary and 
secondary outcomes in the study.  For continuous response (endpoint) variables, conventional general 
linear models will be used.  For endpoints where the respon se is dichotomous (binary), the logistic 
regression model will be used.  For time -to-event endpoints, the Cox regression model will be used.  
Subject  flow will be described using a CONSORT style diagram15. The primary analysis will be conducted 
on an intentio n-to-treat (ITT) basis. The ITT population includes all participants who are randomized.  
12.1. Primary analysis  
To be determined    
12.2. Secondary analyses  
Continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed analogously, possibly log -transformed if 
appropriate. Categorica l endpoints will be compared using a Fisher’s exact test.   
12.3. Justification of the Sample Size  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  
13. STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_275694] 22 subjects will be recruited to obtain the 20 evaluable subjects required for 
the primary endpoint.  
13.1. Discontinuation Criteria Related to the Study  
Discontinuation of the study may be decided due to safety events as determined by [CONTACT_275717].   
Each site investigator will oversee the pat ient safety at his/her site, including the review of all 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs), ensuring that 
appropriate study data are communica ted to the subject‘s physicians and  the IRB /EC, and that 
appropriate referrals or interventions are initiated.  Major unanticipated adverse events and 
unanticipated product problems will be reported to the IRB /EC.  
13.2. Discontinuation Criteria related to the Subject  
The subjects will be advised in the consent form that they have  the right to withdraw from the 
study at any time without prejudice. In the event that a subject drops out of the study, the Study 
Termination CRF should be completed. In the Study Termination CRF the investigator should 
record the reason for the subject ‘s termination. Once randomized, the subject stays within his/her 
group, and will be followed to the end of the study. Those subjects in whom protocol deviation or 
ASAP -HF Clinical Study Protocol   FINAL VERSION 5/30/17  
23 
 violation is noticed will remain in the intention -to-treat group and will be followed accordin g to 
protocol.  
14. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
14.1. Data Collection  
During the study , the investigator, sub -investigator(s), or study coordinator participating in the 
study will record progress notes to document all data required by [CONTACT_760].  
Any changes to information in the study progress notes, or other source documents, must be 
initialed and dated on the date the change is made by a clinician authorized to make the change.  
14.2. Study Documentation  
Throughout the conduct of the study, all required data will be entered into the eCRF for each 
subject. The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data 
reported in the eCRFs and in all required reports. Data entered into the eCRF must be consistent 
with source documents. Any cha nge or correction to an eCRF will be captured in the EDC system 
audit trail.

discrepancies, and missing information.  
14.3. Query Generation and Resolution  
Queries will b e generated based upon anomalous or missing data and will be tracked via the EDC 
System.  
Once all queries are resolved, the database will be verified by [CONTACT_275718]. In addition, as part of the routine  site monitoring, source 
documentation should  be reviewed against data entered into the EDC System.  
14.4. Data Storage  
Access to data maintained in the EDC System is strictly limited to authorized personnel.  
14.5. Study Files and Record Retention  
The investigator must  maintain adequate and accurate records as specified in Essential Documents 
for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial (E6, Section 8 of the ICH Guideline for GCP) to enable the conduct 
of the study to be fully documented and the study data to subsequently be ver ified. These 
documents should be classified into two separate categories: (1) investigator’s study file and (2) 
subject clinical source documents.  
ASAP -HF Clinical Study Protocol   FINAL VERSION 5/30/[ADDRESS_336695] be maintained in the study files : 
 Signed, dated current (within 2 years) curriculum vitae of Investigator and Sub -Investigator(s)  
 Assurance that the  IRB/EC complies with requirements set forth in Title 21 Part 56 of th e Code 
of Federal Regulations. The required documentation consists of name [CONTACT_275723]/EC, a current list of members including title, gender, occupation and any institutional 
affiliation of each member. A general assurance number from the Department of Health and 
Human Services may be substituted for this list.  
 Written notification (copy) to the Investigator from the IRB /EC approving the protocol  
 IRB/EC approved informed consen t (copy) and any other adjunctive materials to be used in the 
study as required.  
15. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC)  
The investigator must have written and dated approval from the IRB /EC for the protocol, consent 
form, subject recruitment materials/process (advertisements), and any other written informati on 
to be provided to subjects. The investigator should also provide the IRB /EC with a copy of the 
product labelin g information and any u pdates. The investigator will provide the IRB /EC with 
reports, updates, and other information (e. g., safety  updates and protocol amendments) as 
required by [CONTACT_19124].  
15.2. Protocol Deviations  
An investigator is required to conduct th is study in accordance wit h this Investigational Plan, 
applicable laws and FDA regulations, and any conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_275719]/EC and FDA. According to FDA regulation 21 CFR § 812.150(a)(4), an investigator shall notify 
the reviewing IRB /EC of any deviation  from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical 
well-being of a subject in an emergency. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later 
than five working days after the emergency occurred.  
A list of subjects with protocol devi ations will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_275696]. Prior to data base lock, an evaluation of 
subjects with significant protocol deviations will be performed to assess the appropriateness of 
their inclusion in the analysis.

 15.3. Risk Analysis and Confidentiality  
15.3.1.  Risk Determination of the Study  
The AirSense 10 AutoSet  device has been cleared  (K140124 ) by [CONTACT_275720]-adjusting 
treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients  weighing more than 66 lbs (30 kg). The 
device is intended for home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect o f 
an adjunctive therapy on the hemodynamics of  adult patients with acute decompensated  heart 
failure and severe sleep  apnea . Continuously t reating the patient  with the device  over a short 
period of time  is hypothesized to affect the pulmonary arterial pressure in these patients . 
Clinical personnel will observe the subject on the fitting and use of the AutoSet  device . The y will 
monitor the subject’s clinical parameters, which include hemodynamics and will intervene, if 
required.  
This study is considered to be of minimal  risk to the patients assigned to the AutoSet  arm of the 
study. PAP therapy is the most widely accepted a nd effective form of treatment for SDB, and the 
risks associated with its use in this study are reasonable in terms of knowledge gained and 
potential benefits to patients. By [CONTACT_5942], use of PAP therapy may be associated with minor side 
effects. Side ef fects may cause minor discomfort, especially in a patient who has not previously 
used PAP therapy. In this study, these side effects will not be classified as adverse events unless 
they do not resolve within a reasonable period of time when PAP therapy is discontinued.  
For patients diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and assigned to the usual  medical therapy arm of 
the study, the risk of not providing treatment for their sleep apnea is deemed as clinically 
acceptable. Subjects enrolled into the study have bee n living with untreated sleep apnea , often for 
many years. The study duration (48hrs while in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will not put these subjects at increased 
risk with regard to their sleep apnea; additionally, all subjects in the study will be counseled 
regarding trea tment of their sleep apnea when they are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
Subjects should be encouraged to discuss any issues they are having with PAP therapy during the 
study. The investigator should assess for changes in the health or well -being of the sub ject in 
response to general, non -directed questioning. Side effects should be documented on the site’s 
source documents. Any transient side effects, at a minimum, should be documented in the clinic 
record.  
15.3.2.  Subject Data Confidentiality  
All information and data collected for the ASAP -HF study concerning subjects or their participation 
in this investigation will be considered confidential. Only authorized personnel will have access to 
these confidential files. All data will be handled in accordance with appli cable local laws. 
Authorized FDA personnel or Regulatory Authorities have the right to inspect and copy all records 
pertinent to this investigation. All data used in the analysis and reporting of this investigation will 
be without identifiable reference to  specific subject name.  
ASAP -HF Clinical Study Protocol   FINAL VERSION 5/30/[ADDRESS_336696] permit clinical trial 
related monitoring, audits, IRB /EC review, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to 
source data/documents,  as appropriate.  
16.2. Polygraphy  Data  
Each participating site will be trained and follow the clinical guide for use of the ApneaLink Air 
device and interpretation of data produced in the report.  
16.3. Six-Minute Walk Test  
Each site must demonstrate the ability to follow a standardized protocol for performance of the 
test, including acceptable coaching phrases  according to methods described in 6MWT SOP .  
16.4. Echocardiograhpy  
Each site should have access to an experienced sonographer and imaging services in order to 
ensure image acquisition quality . 
16.5. Training  
Each site will be trained on  the clinical protocol, study manual, ApneaLink Air and AutoSet  
Instructions for Use, as required . In addition, training on the Data Management System will be 
conducted. If new study staff mem bers are employed at the site after the initiation, experienced 
site personnel must train new employees as noted above and document the training.  
16.6. Site Monitoring  
Each site will have an internal monitor to review the flow of the study and make sure that all  
procedures are being performed in a timely manner. T he monitor will verify that standards of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are being followed.  
16.7. Audits and Inspections  
FDA and any other regulatory agencies may request access to all study records, including source 
documents, for inspection and copying, in kee pi[INVESTIGATOR_275697].

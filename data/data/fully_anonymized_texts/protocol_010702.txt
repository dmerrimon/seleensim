May 11, 2020    CIP#1 2017 Revision  D  7.4 Ceramic Femoral Head  
The 36 mm BIOLOX delta® ceramic femoral head components are manufactured from the same ceramic material 
as the acetabular bearing insert components. The femoral head is secured to the femoral stem component with an interlocking taper.  There are two taper sizes: 11/13 and 12/14 and these sizes correspond to the appropriate femoral stem.  The femoral head is available in several outer diameter sizes and multiple offsets; only 36  mm 
heads will be utilized in this PAS to match the inner diameter of the ceramic bearing insert.  
7.5 Femoral Stem   
The stems  with the 36  mm C ERAMAX
® device include the S UMMIT® POROCOAT®, Tri -Lock® Bone 
Preservation Stem  (BPS) and the S -ROM® devices only. Refer to Exhibit K for a complete listing of permitted 
stems .

DISCLOSURE  
8.1 Study Desig n 
This is a prospective, non- controlled, non- randomized, multicenter study of the 36 mm Ceramic on Ceramic 
(COC) device.  
A new enrollment cohort of a minimum of [ADDRESS_1013465]- op clinic visits the following information will be obtained:  a Harris Hip evaluation, radiographic evaluation, 
subject evaluation and adverse event information (if applicable) .  The primary endpoint in this study is device 
survivorship at [ADDRESS_1013466] -op. A minimum of 80% of enrolled subjects will be confirmed to either have a 
surviving implant or to have had a revision at a minimum of [ADDRESS_1013467], their study participation will end if they withdraw consent, as per PI [INVESTIGATOR_21781], undergo a 
revision of either the acetabular shell and/or liner, are reported as deceased or when they have reached the final endpoint at [ADDRESS_1013468] -op is the primary endpoint in this study.  A revision is defined as the removal of 
any THA component(s), and device survival is defined as the lack of revision.  A 5- year Kaplan -Meier 
survivorship estimate of COC [ADDRESS_1013469] of revision for the COC 36  mm system is assumed to be a constant 1% per year, 
that is, h(t) = 0.01. The survival function for this hazard is  
𝑆𝑆(𝑡𝑡)=𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒�−� ℎ (𝑢𝑢)𝑑𝑑𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡
0�=exp (−0.01𝑡𝑡), 
so at
 5 years, a minimally acceptable level of survival is assumed to be  
p. 11 
 
Confidential  DePuy  Synthes  
May 11, 2020    CIP#1 2017 Revision  D  𝑆𝑆(10)=𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[−0.05]= 0. 951 . 
It will be demonstrated that the Kaplan -Meier 5 -year point estimate of survival is at, or higher than this minimally 
acceptable level of 95.1%.  
8.[ADDRESS_1013470] s will provide a minimum of 136 subjects (80% of enrolled subjects)  with 5-year follow-up.  
This will yield a 5 -year survivorship estimate that has an approximate 3.6% margin of error. In particular, Peto’s 
estimate
1 for the variance of a Kaplan -Meier survival estimate is  
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣�𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)�=�𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)�2�1−𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)�
𝑛𝑛(𝑡𝑡) 
where 𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡) is the estimate of survival at time t and 𝑛𝑛(𝑡𝑡) is the number of unrevised subjects at risk (still being 
followed) at time, and t.  Hence, if it is assumed that the point estimate of survival is at a minimally acceptable 
level of 95.1% for subjects in t his PAS , and there is a minimum of 136 subjects (80% of enrolled subjects) at 5-
years post -operatively upon which this estimate is based, then an estimate fo r the variance of the Kaplan -Meier 
survival estimate at 5 years is  
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣�𝑆𝑆̂(5)�=[0.951 ]2(0.049 )
136= 0. [ZIP_CODE]  , 
and a two -sided 95% confidence interval margin of error for survival at 5 years is anticipated  to be approximately 
1.96∗√0.[ZIP_CODE] = 3. 6%.   
A sample size of 170 enrolled subjects is therefore justified in order to obtain a 3.6% margin of error on a 5 year  
survivorship estimate. 8.5 Anticipated Number of Subjects with Minimum 5 Year Follow- up 
A minimum of 80% of enrolled subjects ( 136 subjects) will be confirmed to either have a surviving implant or to 
have had a revision at a minimum of [ADDRESS_1013471] in the study.

endpoints will be reported in each interim PAS report to FDA.     
8.8 Interim Analysis  
There are no planned interim analyses for the purpose of terminating the study early.  However, some statistical analyses may be performed for conference presentations or abstracts prior to the primary endpoint being reached.  
 Interim analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be carried out for each interim PAS report to FDA.  
8.9 Analysis Plan  
At the time of each interim PAS report, the following analyses will be presented for all subjects combined, as well as separately for each individual stem type that is represented in the PAS, and also separately for each individual cup type that is represented in the PAS:   
• Baseline summary statistics will be calculated for age, weight,  BMI , race, ethnicity and pre-op Harris Hip 
Scores for both cohorts. The proportion of each gender will be calculated.  
• Harris Hip score summary statistics and change from baseline statistics will be reported for each protocol defined post -op visit interval.  These will be provided for total Harris Hip score as well as the Harris Hip 
sub-scores (pain, function, activity, deformity, and range of motion) . These will be provided for total 
Harris Hip score as well as the Harris Hip sub -score s.  Results will be presented overall, as well as stratified 
by [CONTACT_139447] (non- obese vs. obese) according to BMI (subjects with BMI < 30 and with BMI ≥  30, 
respectively)
2. 
• Subject -reported outcomes will be reported for each protocol defined post- op visit interval.  
• Radiographic analysis will be reported for each protocol defined post-op visit interval.  
• Tabular displays of all cumulative reported adverse events will be provided by [CONTACT_60235], as well as by [CONTACT_17203] (intraoperative, postoperative -operative site, systemic, and o verall).  Tables will also be 
provided of adverse events over time. 
• A Kaplan -Meier survivorship analysis will be provided, with device survivorship as a function of post -op 
time.   A proportional hazards model will be provided, in which device survivorship is a function of post -
op time, and with BMI (at the time of index surgery) as a covariate.   Implant survival will be reported 
over time where greater than 40 hips are still at risk of revision.   
• For Subjects that are not able to return to clinic at the 3- or 4-year interval, device survivorship information 
will be obtained through telephone interviews and will be utilized in the Kaplan -Meier analysis of device 
survivorship for the primary endpoint analysis in the study.

• Undesirable shortening or lengthening of the limb; 
• Traumatic arthrosis of the hip from intraoperative positioning of the extremity; 
• Cardiovascular disorders including venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction; 
• Temporary or permanent neuropathies; 
• Delayed wound healing; 
• Infecti on; 
• Osteolysis;  
• Fracture, migration, loosening, subluxation, or dislocation of the prosthesis or any of its components, any of which may require a second surgical intervention or revision; 
• Periarticular calcification or ossification, with or without impediment to joint mobility;  
• Inadequate range of motion due to improper selection or positioning of components, by [CONTACT_741234][INVESTIGATOR_20804], and periarticular calcification; and  
• Death.  
 
These possible AEs are not unique to the C ERAMAX
® Ceramic Hip System and, as stated above, may occur with 
any total joint replacement surgery. 10.2 Potential Adverse Events (AEs) Associated with the C ERAMAX
® Ceramic Hip System  
The most commonly reported adverse events related to the  DePuy Synthes C ERAMAX® Ceramic Total Hip 
System are:  
• Wear of the ceramic acetabular components has been reported following total hip replacement.  Higher 
rates of wear may be initiated by [CONTACT_741235], metal, or other debris that can cause abrasion of the articulating surfaces.  Higher rates of wear may shorten the useful life of the prosthesis, and lead to early revision surgery to replace the worn prosthetic components.   
• While rare, fatigue fracture of the prosthetic component can occur as a result of improper assembly, trauma, strenuous activity, improper alignment, or duration of service. 
• Component dissociation. 
• Breakage or chippi[INVESTIGATOR_741228]/or ceramic acetabular insert.  
  There are no additional risks to the subject associated with participation in this study.  The evaluations included in the study are considered to be the standard of care for following total hip replacement patients.  Likewise, there is no personal benefit to the subject for participation in this study.  However, data collected in this study will contribute t o the safety profile of this Ceramic on Ceramic articulation.

• Other serious important medical events. Report when the event does not fit the other outcomes, but the 
event may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to 
prevent one of the other outcomes.  
Examples of procedur e related serious AEs (SAEs) may 
include: stiffness requiring manipulation of the hip under anesthesia, dislocation of hip requiring closed reduction, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
Examples of device related SAEs may include 
radiolu cent lines around the femoral component or 
device dislocation.  
Unexpected/ Unanticipated Adverse 
Device Effect (UADE)   Is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety, or any life -threatening problems, or death, caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the Clinical Investigation Plan, 
or application, or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associate with a device th at relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of Subjects.  A UADE will not be listed 
in the Instructions for Use (IFU).  
 
In the event of a UADE or serious adverse device  effect, 
the Investigator should institute appropriate therapeutic 
and follow -up measur es in accordance with good 
medical practice and notify the local IRB /EC.  The 
Investigator must document follow -up treatment in the 
“comment” section of the AE e CRF.  A full written report

May 11, 2020    CIP#[ADDRESS_1013477] notify FDA, all reviewing 
IRB/REB/EC ’s and all participating Clinical 
Investigators of all UADEs within [ADDRESS_1013478] receiving notice of the event.  In addition, the event will be reported to the DePuy 
Synthes Complaint 
Handling Unit (CHU) for investigation.  
Device Deficiencies   Are defined as in adequacy of a medical device with 
respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability safety 
or performance. Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors and inadequate labeling. Device deficiencies should institute appropriate therapeutic and follow-
up measures in accordance with good medical 
practice and notify the IRB /EC as applicable.  The 
Investigator must document follow -up tr eatment of the 
AE and the Sponsor will report the event to the DePuy 
Synthes Complaint Ha ndling Unit (CHU) for 
investigation.  
10.4 Definition of AE Severity  
An AE  may be: 
• Mild : Easily tolerated and transient in nature with minimal or no impairment of normal ac tivity . 
Intervention is not indicated. Clinical or diagnostic observations only and no impairment of normal activity.  
• Moderate: Poorly tolerated, sustained and interferes with normal activity and requires medical attention. Intervention is either noninvasive or not indicated. Activities of daily living can be sustained.  
• Severe: P oorly tolerated, requires intervention and significantly affects activities of daily life; or places 
the Subject at immed iate risk or harm.  
10.5 Adverse E vent (AE) Reporting  
The definition of an AE is provided above in Table 5 . Pre -existing medical conditions or symptoms reported 
prior to the surgical event are to be recorded as part of the medical history and not be recorded/reported as AEs. The only exception would be in the  event there is an exacerbation of a pre- existing medical condition or 
symptom(s) in the post- operative time frame, then an AE must be reported.   
 A record of each AE , except for  those anticipated AEs listed in  Exhibit L , including details of the AEs are 
reported beginning from surgery and until Subject participation has ended (study completed,  or consent 
withdrawn). Study sites have two (2) weeks from when they become aware of AEs to inform the Sponsor via the 
p. 23 
 
Confidential  DePuy  Synthes  
May 11, 2020    CIP#[ADDRESS_1013479] the Sponsor directly or your Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA) to report.  
 AEs must be followed to resolution, or until the study completion or consent withdrawal. When a Subject ends participation in the study (either completion or consent withdrawal) AEs must be reviewed and designated, if applicable, as “resolved” and an end date provided. If AEs are not resolved at the end of a Subject’s participation,  
they will be considered ongoing.   An AE should be reported for each AE – meaning, if edema  and bleeding occur secondary to a fall there will be 
two (2) AEs reported that can be attributed to a fall. Subjects should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously and may volunteer AE information at any time. At each evaluation, t he Subject should be asked if any AEs have 
occurred since their last evaluation.   If an event occurs at an outside institution, the Investigator should attempt 
to obtain, if possible, required AE information.   The Investigator will record the nature, severity, treatment and outcome of the AE, and will determine their association to the device and/or the study procedure (see Section 10.6 below) .  
 All UADE s, SADEs and SAEs,  defined in Table [ADDRESS_1013480] the Sponsor directly or your CRA to report.  
In the event of a UADE the investigator should institute appropriate therapeutic and follow -up measures in 
accordance with good medical practice and notify the ir IRB/EC.  The investigator must document follow -up 
treatment in the “comment” section of  the A E CRF.  A full written report of the event must be forwarded to 
DePuy Synthes within [ADDRESS_1013481] notify FDA, all reviewing IRB’s and all participating clinical investigators of all UADEs 
within [ADDRESS_1013482] receiving notice of the event.  In addition, the event will be immediately and electronically reported to the DePuy Synthes Complaint Handling Unit (CHU) for investigation. 10.6 Determination of Relationship to Device and/or Procedure  
The determinati on whether the AE is related to the device and/or procedure will be based upon whether a causal 
relationship between the device or procedure and the AE a reasonable possibility is , i.e., the relationship cannot 
be ruled out. A causal relationship cannot be ruled out if, in the medical judgement of the Investigator, the effect follows a reasonable temporal association with the use of the device and/or is confirmed by [CONTACT_741237], and/or  the effect is not reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_31388]’s clinical state.   Device related AEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_741238], if applicable, to the appropriate regulatory body.  10.7 Minimization of Risk  
Only trained orthopaedic surgeons with expertise in treating total hip conditions will participate in this study.  
 Investigators should refer to the instructions for use (package insert, Exhibit H ) for additional information and  
reference the surgical technique ( Exhibit D ).

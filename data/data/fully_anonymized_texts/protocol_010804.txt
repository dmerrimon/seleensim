Version Date: June 06, 2022 1 Detailed Protocol  Protocol Title: Treatment Engagement in Families with Substance Use and Psychosis: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_325790]: June 13, 2022   Original IRB Approval Date: September 15, 2020  Phase 1: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_195015] M. McCarthy, Ph.D., McLean Imaging Center, McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [ADDRESS_402403]., Belmont, MA [ZIP_CODE], [PHONE_6816] (office), [EMAIL_6362] (email).  Study Performance Site:  Admissions Building and McLean Imaging Center, McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [ADDRESS_402404]., Belmont, MA [ZIP_CODE]  I.  Background and Significance  Treatment Engagement Challenges: Psychosis and Substance Use Disorders. Co-occurring substance use disorders significantly increase the likelihood of treatment dropout for people with first epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743] (FEP) (Conus et al., 2010). This is a critical concern, because approximately 50-70% of people with FEP have a lifetime history of substance use disorder (Cather et al., 2018; Shinn et al., 2015), endorse recent tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use (Oluwoye et al., 2019), and approximately 30% of people with FEP disengage from treatment (Dixon et al., 2016; Doyle et al., 2014). Though evidence-based treatments are available for FEP and substance use (e.g., Kane et al., 2016), they cannot be effective if clients are not engaged in treatment. Insufficient readiness to engage in substance use treatment likely contributes to poor outcomes among clients with co-occurring substance use disorders and FEP. These results call for novel strategies to increase substance use disorder treatment engagement, which has the potential to make a significant impact on reducing substance use in this population.  Treatment Engagement Intervention. Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) is an evidence-based intervention that increases treatment engagement for substance use disorders regardless of diagnosis (Meyers et al., 1999). CRAFT acknowledges that people with substance use disorders may not be ready to change their substance use, and it capi[INVESTIGATOR_325791] (CSOs e.g., family members) as agents of change. Such families often seek additional support, as they experience elevated family distress associated with the identified patient’s (IP) addiction and psychosis (Orford et al., 2013). CRAFT has not been studied with CSOs of individuals with co-occurring substance use and psychosis to date. Targeting CSOs may decrease family distress and facilitate greater substance use treatment engagement in FEP IPs. In this context, the CSOs are the subjects of intervention.  Many individuals with FEP have frequent contact [CONTACT_325815] (Drapalski et al., 2018), but time, transportation, finances, and childcare are barriers to family members accessing additional services. Utilizing telemedicine (e.g., video conferencing) mitigates these barriers, and such technology typi[INVESTIGATOR_325792]-person therapy (Hulsbosch et al., 2017; Tse et al., 2015). å 
 Substance Use and Psychosis  
Version Date: June 06, 2022 2 Phase 1: We will first develop a CRAFT for FEP delivered via telemedicine (CRAFT-FT) manual/training protocol by [CONTACT_70974]-label cross-over feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_325793] (N=14) completing the first half of sessions in-person and the second half via telemedicine in counterbalanced order; we will also recruit corresponding FEP clients (N=14). Second, we will collect interview/focus group feedback on feasibility/delivery preferences to refine the manual. Third, we will further test the manual feasibility and collect feedback in a second two-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (CRAFT-F N=7; CRAFT-FT N=7); we will also recruit corresponding FEP clients in each condition (CRAFT-F N=7; CRAFT-FT N=7). FEP clients will complete assessments only, as the study intervention is targeted toward family members.  In light of COVID-[ADDRESS_402405]/staff safety concerns, we may forego the cross-over and randomized designs involving in-person visits to have family subjects participate in the CRAFT-FT via virtual visits only.  Phase 2: After developi[INVESTIGATOR_325794], we will take the adapted CRAFT-FT protocol, now termed CRAFT for early psychosis (CRAFT-EP), and conduct a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_325795]-EP plus treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU alone. Family members (N=40) will be randomized to CRAFT-EP + TAU (N=20) or TAU alone (N=20). The CRAFT-EP intervention nis targeted toward family members, but given participant feedback from the development stage of the study, FEP clients will now have the option for limited intervention participation if their family member is randomized to CRAFT-EP + TAU. We will also recruit FEP clients (up to N=40) for assessment purposes for CRAFT-EP + TAU (N=20) and TAU alone (N=20). If a FEP client subject does not have a family member participating in the study, the FEP client will be automatically be assigned to the TAU alone group. Total target enrollment is N=80 (N=40 family members and up to N=40 FEP clients). To account for potential attrition, an additional N=12 participants (N=6 family member and N=6 FEP clients) may be recruited, and the overall total enrollment would be up to N=92 (N=46 family members and N=46 FEP clients).   II.  Specific Aims  Phase 1: Develop a feasible telemedicine and in-person Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) protocol to improve treatment engagement for families with substance use and psychosis.   Hypothesis 1A: The adapted CRAFT protocol will be feasible as measured by [CONTACT_325816] (%) and participant satisfaction questionnaire/interview assessments.   Phase 2: Test preliminary efficacy of CRAFT-EP plus TAU compared to TAU alone.   Hypothesis 2A: CRAFT-EP will improve IP substance use treatment engagement compared to TAU as measured by [CONTACT_325817] 30-day sessions attended %.  Hypothesis 2B: CRAFT-EP will reduce FEP client substance use more than TAU as measured by [CONTACT_6270]-report past 30-day use, and biological verification of use (e.g., urine) when available.

Ratings will range from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for overall experience and convenience.  Time Frame: Up to 8 weeks 3. Title: Percentage of Participant Preference for In-person, Telemedicine, or Both Session Formats Description: Percentage of participant preference for in-person, telemedicine, or both sessions formats as assessed categorically during the Treatment Satisfaction Interview.  Time Frame: Up to [ADDRESS_402420] to participant satisfaction with the initial version of the CRAFT-F/FT protocol and session completion % at post-intervention. We will also review recorded interview/focus group data as qualitative feedback to inform a feasible revised protocol tailored to the unique needs of families with co-occurring substance use disorders and FEP. Following iterative feasibility testing of the revised protocol, we will again conduct descriptive statistics and collect feedback to confirm its feasibility. GLM and correlational analyses will be used to explore preliminary efficacy of the intervention and its relationship with sample characteristics.   Phase 2 Outcome measures for statistical analysis include: Primary Outcome 1 Title: Mean readiness to change substance use Description: Mean readiness to cutdown/quit using [most problematic substance] for the client with psychosis using importance-confidence-readiness rulers (0 = not at all to 10 = extremely). Time Frame: Baseline, mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) Secondary  Outcome 2 Title: Percentage of Session Attendance  Description: Percentage of treatment sessions attended by [CONTACT_325826] 30 days. 
 Substance Use and Psychosis  
Version Date: June 06, 2022 14 Time Frame: Baseline, mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) Outcome 3 Title: Substance Use  Description: Client Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) past 30 day substance use, urine toxicology screen for drugs of abuse. Time Frame: Baseline, mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) Outcome 4 Title: Family Wellbeing: Depression Description: Beck Depression Inventory-II total; scores range from 0 to 63 with higher scores representing more severe depressive symptoms.  Time Frame: Baseline, mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) Outcome 5 Title: Family Wellbeing: Anxiety Description: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Short Form; total scores range from 6 to 24 with higher scores representing more severe anxiety symptoms. Time Frame: Baseline, mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8) Outcome 6 Title: Family Wellbeing: Relationship  Description: General Happi[INVESTIGATOR_325807]; scores range from 1 to 10 with higher scores representing greater relationship happi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Time Frame: Baseline, mid-intervention (week 4), post-intervention (week 8)  For the randomized controlled trial phase, repeated measures random regression analyses comparing the rate of change between groups (CRAFT-EP + TAU vs. TAU alone) for the primary analyses (treatment engagement: FEP client readiness to change substance use), as well as secondary analyses (treatment engagement % session attendance, substance use outcomes, and family wellbeing measures). We will use a model for the mean of the outcome variable that includes terms for intervention, time, and the intervention-by-time interaction, and we will use generalized estimating equations to adjust standard errors for the correlation of observations within individuals. The coefficient for the intervention-by-time interaction term at after session 8 quantifies the difference between groups at session 8, adjusted for baseline. In separate analyses, we will use linear regression to explore the association between baseline predictor variables with treatment engagement, substance use, and family wellbeing outcomes. We will perform exploratory analyses of the 3-month follow-up time point and potential moderating effects of sex to inform the design of future studies.   Power. N/A  VII.  Risks and Discomforts  One potential risk is a breach of confidentiality. This could lead a subject’s employer, insurance company, or others to learn about their participation in the research study.   It is possible that some of the questions in the medical, personality or psychiatric assessments and tasks may cause subjects to become fatigued or emotionally upset and distressed, but this is unlikely and would be expected to be very mild should it occur. Subjects will be informed that they may take a break at any time or refuse to answer any questions that they wish. Study personnel will be trained to manage any distress that arises.  VIII.  Potential Benefits 
 Substance Use and Psychosis  
Version Date: June 06, [ADDRESS_402421] benefits to subjects. For participants assigned to the CRAFT-EP intervention, possible benefits may include gaining additional support and copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. Families with a history of psychosis and/or substance use may benefit in the future from what we learn in this study.   IX.  Monitoring and Quality Assurance  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325808]. Data and safety monitoring will take place continuously throughout the study during weekly study meetings, and we will review deviations and adverse events in monthly meetings. We will report both adverse events and all serious adverse events that occur during the study to the Partners IRB. We will provide the Partners IRB with a summary of any unexpected and related adverse events as well as any other unanticipated problems that occurred at the time during the annual continuing review.  Suicidality: If participants spontaneously report suicidality during the phone screen or study visit or if they endorse suicidality on an instrument (MADRS response 4 or 6 on item 10; SCID-5 response of 2 or 3 on A17 or affirmative response on OP9-OP12 and OP14; BDI-II response 2 or greater on item 9), research staff will implement the study suicidality standard operating procedures. Domestic Violence: If participants spontaneously report a history of domestic violence with a member of their current household or if they endorse such a history on an instrument (phone screen domestic violence question affirmative response involving a member of their current household, SCID-[ADDRESS_402422] to domestic violence involving a member of their current household), research staff will implement the study domestic violence standard operating procedures.   All adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be investigated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_325809].   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_325810]-approved protocol and will frequently monitor the overall progress of the study.   X.  References Cather et al. (2017).

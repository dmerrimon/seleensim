PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
 
Protocol Title:   A Randomized, Open-label, Phase 2 Study of Sipuleucel-T with Concurrent 
Versus Sequential Administration of Enzalutamide in Men with Metastatic Castrate-Resistant 
Prostate Cancer 
Protocol Number:  P12-2 
Clinical Phase:  [ADDRESS_690946], Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) 
is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate an immune response 
against prostate cancer.  It consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), 
including antigen presenting cells ([APCs], defined as large CD54-positive PBMCs) that have 
been activated in vitro with prostate antigen PA2024, a recombinant fusion protein composed of 
prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte-macrophage colo ny-stimulating factor. 
A dose of sipuleucel-T is prepared using PBMCs from a single leukapheresis procedure.  A 
minimum of 50 million APCs (the biologically active component of sipuleucel-T) are 
administered via a single intravenous (IV) infusion.  A complete treatment of sipuleucel-T will 
include 3 doses of autologous cells, infused at approximately 2-week intervals. 
Sipuleucel-T is indicated for use in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 
metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC ). 
Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor.  It is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
mCRPC who have previously received docetaxel.  The enzalutamide dose used in this study will 
be [ADDRESS_690947], Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  No reference product will be 
used in this clinical study. 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate peripheral PA2024-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel-T over time via a 
T cell stimulation index from a proliferation assay. 
Secondary Objectives: 
 To evaluate time to prostate-specific antigen ( PSA) progression.

 To estimate the percent of subjects who are PSA progression-free at 12 months. 
 To evaluate overall survival.  
 To determine the magnitude of peripheral immune response over time as determined by [CONTACT_14504]: 
– Peripheral PAP-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel-T over time via a T cell 
stimulation index from a proliferation assay. 
– T cell interferon- γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) response to 
P
A2024 and PAP. 
– Humoral response to PA2024 and PAP by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). 
– Chemokine and cytokine production via fluorescent immunoassay (Luminex® assay). 
 To evaluate safety. 
Exploratory Objectives: 
 To evaluate time to next anticancer intervention. 
 To evaluate time to first cancer-related opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. 
 To evaluate time to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
decline. 
Study Design and Duration: 
This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effects of sipuleuc el-T when 
administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide.  This study consists of [ADDRESS_690948]-
treatment visit ([ADDRESS_690949] study treatment).  The long term follow-up 
(
LTFU) phase will begin after the post-treatment visit and will continue until the subject’s death 
or until Dendreon terminates the study. 
Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel-T in addition to a total of 52 weeks of concurrent or sequential treatment with 
enzalutamide.  Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_532181] (≥ 25 ng/mL, yes or no) and

Proprietary and Confidential screening lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (≥ 200 IU/L, yes or no), both obtained from the 
central laboratory. 
Enzalutamide treatment will occur either concurrently with sipuleucel-T (concurrent arm), or 
following administration of sipuleucel-T (sequential arm): 
Concurrent Arm  
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T concurrent ly with enzalutamide (160 mg orally once 
daily).  Enzalutamide treatment will start [ADDRESS_690950] one partial (> 0 mL) 
infusion of sipuleucel- T will not receive any additional enzalutamide treatment, will 
undergo a post-treatment visit, and will enter the LTFU phase. 
Sequential Arm  
Subjects will receive sipuleucel-T followed by [CONTACT_171313] (160 mg orally once daily).  
Enzalutamide treatment will start approximately [ADDRESS_690951] one partial (> 0 mL) infusion of sipuleucel-T will not receive any

The study design is illustrated below. 
 
Abbreviation:  LTFU = long-term follow-up. 
 
Study Population and Sample Size:  Approximately 100 men with mCRPC, 18 years of age or 
older will be enrolled.  
Statistical Considerations: 
The study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference between the treatment arms for 
immune response over time evaluated on the basis of PA2024-stimulated T cell proliferation via 
tritiated-thymidine uptake.  The immune response population will consist of all subjects who 
receive [ADDRESS_690954] 10 weeks of enzalutamide.  PA2024 -specific T 
cell proliferation responses over time will be compared between the concurrent arm and 
sequential arm using a repeated measurement mixed model analysis. 
With 43 subjects per treatment arm (concurrent and sequential), there is 90% power to detect a 2-
fold difference in mean response between the arms at any time point assuming a coefficient of

States, comprising 29% of new cancer cases (241,740 new cancer cases).  Approximately 80% of 
prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the primary site.  An 
additional 12% are diagnosed when locally advanced, and a further 4% when the cancer has 
already metastasized (Howlader 2011 ).  Prostate cancer-related deaths typi[INVESTIGATOR_241399] a result 
of complications of metastatic disease, with an estimated 28,170 annual deaths in 2012  
(Siegel 2012). 
Treatment of localized prostate cancer typi[INVESTIGATOR_333364] a curative intent and may include radical 
prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, high intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, or 
hormone therapy.  Watchful waiting or active surveillance may be employed where the risks of 
the treatment outweigh the benefits, taking into account the patient’s age and general health 
status. 
Although primary therapy effectively cures the majority of patients, disease does recur in 
approximately 20% to 40% of individuals, where an increased level of serum prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) may be considered to be evidence of biochemical failure and progression to 
advanced disease ( Ward 2005 ). 
In men with recurrent disease, the current standard of care for androgen-dependent, advanced 
prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) using a luteinizing hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist, an LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy, which results in 
similar, and initially high,  anticancer activity, with response rates attaining 80%.  A peripheral 
antiandrogen, such as flutamide or bicalutamide, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_532143], but randomized Phase [ADDRESS_690964] not consistently demonstrated a survival benefit with continuous combined androgen 
blockade (ADT plus antiandrogen) as compared with ADT alone ( Klotz 2001 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_532144], virtually all patients with recurrent disease will progress and their disease will 
spread to distant sites, most commonly bones and/or regional lymph nodes ( Scher 1996 ,  
Small 1997) .  Disseminated or metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer  (mCRPC) is a 
noncurable and lethal disease with a median survival reported in recent Phase 3 studies ranging 
from 12.2 to 27.2  months (Kantoff 2010 , Ryan 2013 ). 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013  Page 13 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Until recently, docetaxel was the only therapy demonstrated to enhance overall survival in 
patients with mCRPC ( Petrylak 2004 , Tannock 2004 ).  However, since 2010, sipuleucel-T 
(Provenge®, Provenge 2012 ), cabazitaxel (Jevtana®, Jevtana 2012 ), abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®, 
Zytiga 2012 ), and enzalutamide (Xtandi®, Xtandi 2011 ) have all received Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of mCRPC based on their demonstrated ability 
to increase overall survival.  This increasing repertoire of approved agents for the treatment of 
mCRPC creates challenges within the treatment paradigm as there are currently no clinical data 
to inform how these agents are best sequenced. 
Although enzalutamide is indicated for the treatment of patients with mCRPC who have received 
prior chemotherapy, it has also been listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
Guidelines for prechemotherapy treatment of patients with mCRPC who have an evidence level 
2A.  Sipuleucel-T and enzalutamide both have the potential to be administered prior to 
chemotherapy to asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with mCRPC.  Because 
androgen ablation has been demonstrated to have immunostimulatory properties, there is 
potential synergy from combining the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide with  
sipuleucel-T (Mercader 2001 , Drake 2005 , Gannon 2009 , Sutherland 2005, Koh 2009,  
Madan 2008
).  An evidence-based approach to assess the consequences of concurrent or 
sequential therapy with enzalutamide and sipuleucel-T is therefore warranted to optimize the 
benefits of these agents within the therapeutic paradigm. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_690965] prostate cancer.  It consists of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), including antigen presenting cells (APCs, defined as large CD54-positive PBMCs) 
that have been activated in vitro with prostate antigen PA2024, a recombinant fusion protein 
composed of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) linked to granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (GM-CSF).  
Sipuleucel-T was approved in the [LOCATION_002] in 2010 for the treatment of men with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (hormone refractory) mCRPC ( Provenge 2011).  In the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076] D9902B (IMPACT), 512 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel- T 
(N=341 subjects) or control (N=171 subjects).  Overall survival was longer in the sipuleucel- T 
group (median of 25.8 months versus 21.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.98; P=0.03).  More than 3,339 infusions of sipuleucel-T and control (a 
product manufactured from PBMCs without activation with the PA2024 antigen), have been 
administered to men with prostate cancer in clinical trials.

Proprietary and Confidential Clinical data to support the safety of sipuleucel-T are provided from 904 subjects (sipuleucel-T, 
N = 601; control, N = 303) who participated in 4 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
controlled Phase 3 studies ( Provenge 2011).  Three of these studies were conducted in men with 
mCRPC (studies D9902B, D9901, and D9902A), and 1 study was conducted in men with 
androgen dependent prostate cancer (ADPC).  In the 4 randomized Phase 3 studies, adverse 
events (AEs) reported in ≥ 20% of all subjects were chills, fatigue, pyrexia, and back pain.  The 
most common AEs (observed in ≥ 5% of sipuleucel-T subjects as well as at least twice the rate of 
that in control subjects) included chills, pyrexia, headache, myalgia, influenza-like illness, and 
hyperhidrosis.  The majority of these events occurred within 1 day of infusion; were grade 1 or 2 
in severity; and were generally of short duration (i.e., resolved in ≤  2  days).  Grade 3 or 4 
events were reported in 27.6% of subjects in the sipuleucel-T group, compared with 28.4% in the 
control group.  Cerebrovascular events (CVEs) occurred in 3.5% of subjects in the sipuleucel- T 
group compared with 2.6% in the control group.  A registry of approximately 1,[ADDRESS_690966] previously received docetaxel ( Xtandi 2012).  Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor 
inhibitor that acts on several steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway. 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_532145], 1199 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral enzalutamide 
(160 mg per day, N=800 subjects) or placebo (N=399 subjects).  Overall survival was longer in 
the enzalutamide group (median of 18.4 months versus 13.6 months; HR=0.63; 95% CI: 0.53, 
0.75, P < 0.001) (Scher 2008 ).  Common AEs associated with enzalutamide includ ed some 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE,  
NCI 2010) grade 3-4 events that had a ≥ 2% absolute increase in frequency in the enzalutamide 
arm compared to the placebo arm.  These included asthenic conditions, peripheral edema, back 
pain, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, muscular weakness, musculoskeletal weakness, diarrhea, 
hot flush, hypertension, headache, dizziness, spi[INVESTIGATOR_532146], paresthesia, mental impairment disorders, hypoesthesia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_67705], lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_532147], insomnia, anxiety, hematuria, pollakiuria, 
fall, nonpathologic fractures, pruritus, dry skin, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].  Seven out of 800 enzalutamide-
treated subjects (0.9%) experienced a seizure and were discontinued from the study. Grade 3 and 
4 AEs were reported among 47% of enzalutamide-treated subjects and 53% of placebo-treated 
subjects (Xtandi 2012).

Proprietary and Confidential 6.8.4 Immune Gene Expression Analyses 
Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a heterogeneous disease, with varying symptoms 
and overall survival ranging from several months to several years ( Scher 2011 ).  The ability to 
accurately predict outcome in men with CRPC is a crucial element in understanding response to 
treatment.  While many studies have correlated clinical and laboratory variables with survival,  
the role that the immune system plays in controlling prostate cancer has not been fully studied, 
mainly due to the complexity of the immune system.  Moreover, immune response assays can 
only interrogate discrete pathways 1 at a time, rather than assess the complex interaction between 
the various cellular and secreted components that comprise the entire immune system.  Recent 
studies (Ross 2012 , Olmos 2012 ) have shown that gene-expression profiling of peripheral blood 
cells can yield prognostic information with regards to control of CRPC.  
An integrated and standardized system for collection, transport, and storage of whole blood 
specimens and isolation of either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or genomic deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) (e.g., PAXgene®), will allow analyses of immune gene expression by [CONTACT_532193]. 
At screening, an 8.5 mL blood sample will be collected for baseline immune genetic analysis in a 
specialized tube that stabilizes intracellular DNA (e.g., PAXgene® Blood DNA Tube). 
At all immune monitoring assessment time points, a 2.5 mL blood sample will be collected to 
assess immune gene expression profiles through analysis of intracellular RNAs in immune cells.  
These blood samples will be collected in a specialized tube containing an additive that stabilizes 
intracellular RNA (e.g., PAXge ne® Blood RNA Tube). 
Neither the subject nor the investigator will receive results from gene expression analysis. 
6.8.5 Sample Retention 
Samples from subjects who do not provide consent for additional optional research  
(Section 6.8.6) will be retained for up to 5 years following Dendreon’s completion of the trial 
and then will be destroyed. 
6.8.6 Additional Optional Research 
Subjects will be given the opportunity to allow Dendreon to retain their blood samples (obtained 
for immune response, lot release, product characterization, and gene expression analysis ) 
indefinitely and to use them for other testing.  No additional blood draws will be required beyond 
those already being collected as part of the study.  Additional research may include genetic 
testing and retained samples may be sent to outside laboratories for testing. 
 
PR-2303.00, [ADDRESS_691036] a refrigerated centrifuge, a monitored and alarmed refrigerator, and a 
freezer (-20°C or below) as well as containers and dry ice for shipment of blood samples.

visits and study activities. 
Dendreon will provide an approved protocol and any required amendments or administrative 
letters, as well as the IB and electronic CRFs.  Materials needed for the collection of laboratory 
samples, including immune monitoring samples, will be provided by [CONTACT_102666].  Dendreon will

7.[ADDRESS_691037] a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment.  
Adverse events include exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, an increase in frequency or 
intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756], a condition detected or diagnosed after 
product administration (even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study) or a 
continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at screening that worsen following the start of 
the study. 
7.1 Categories for Ranking Severity of Adverse Events 
The NCI CTCAE ( NCI 2010 ) will be used to score AE severity.  In general, the following 
general severity definitions apply: 
Mild (Grade 1):  The AE results in mild, easily tolerated symptoms, or is asymptomatic 
with clinical or diagnostic observations only.  Intervention is not usually 
indicated. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 43 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Moderate (Grade 2): The AE produces moderate symptoms with discomfort sufficient to 
interfere with some aspect of the subject’s normal daily activity.  Minimal, 
local, or noninvasive intervention is required. 
Severe (Grade 3): The AE is medically significant but not immediately life threatening, 
results in discomfort or disability which is incapacitating and prevents 
most normal daily activities, clearly damaging to the health, requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_532157]. 
Life Threatening   
(Grade 4):  The AE could reasonably result in death unless immediate medical 
intervention is undertaken. 
Fatal (Grade 5): The AE results in death. 
7.2 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments 
The following categories will be used to determine relatedness of AEs to study treatments: 
None: The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or concomitant 
medications administered to the subject. 
Possible: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study treatment, but could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
Probable:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
study treatment and cannot readily have been produced by [CONTACT_29320]’s 
clinical state, environmental factors, or other modes of therapy or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject. 
7.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194636], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  An important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
 
PR-2303.00, [ADDRESS_691038] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of dru g 
dependency or drug abuse. 
7.3.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
All SAEs reported or observed, regardless of relationship to study treatments, and any remedial 
action(s) required, will be collected at all visits from registration through the post-treatment visit.  
Only treatment-related SAEs, seizures, and CVEs (regardless of causality) ongoing at the time of 
the post-treatment visit will be followed by [CONTACT_117186], return to baseline, or 
the investigator determines no further improvement is expected.  Only new treatment-related 
AEs and SAEs, seizures, and CVEs (regardless of causality) will be collected after the post-

[IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Reporting Requirements 
Dendreon will notify the FDA and all participating principal investigators of any AE associated 
with the use of study treatments that is serious, unexpected and at least possibly related.  Such 
notification will be provided within 15 calendar days after Dendreon’s initial receipt of the 
information.  If the event was fatal or life threatening, FDA will be notified no later than 7 days 
after Dendreon’s initial receipt of the report.

or SAE report form. 
7.4.1 Safety Monitoring and Enrollment Suspension 
An internal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be notified within 48 hours of AEs with an 
outcome of death and nonfatal AEs with Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_691045] possibly related 
to the study treatment.  Consideration will be given to suspending enrollment to an arm for any 
of the following: 
 An AE with an outcome of death which is at least possibly related to the study 
trea
tment(s). 
 The occurrence of nonfatal AEs with Grade ≥ 3 toxicities (with the exception of Grade 3 
chills, pyrexia, fatigue, or asthenia) which are at least possibly related to study 
treatment(s) in more than [ADDRESS_691046] 10 subjects enrolled in an arm, or in more than 
30% of subjects in an arm at any time beyond enrollment of 10 subjects in that arm.  
If enrollment is suspended in either arm, study treatments will be discontinued in all subjects 
meeting any of the criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056] (Section  4.3), but may be continued in all other 
subjects.  Enrollment to the suspended arm will resume only with concurrence of the DMC and 
FDA. 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 General Considerations  
This Phase 2 randomized, open-label study is designed to assess the effects of sipuleucel-T when 
administered concurrently or sequentially with enzalutamide.  Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to 
either the concurrent arm or the sequential arm, stratified by [CONTACT_30776] (≥ 25 ng/mL, yes or no) 
and LDH levels (≥ 200 IU/L, yes or no).  In general, data will be summarized in aggregate and 
by [CONTACT_2939].  All statistical tests will be performed at the 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_691047] the null hypothesis of no difference between the treatment arms for 
immune response over time evaluated using PA2024-stimulated T cell proliferation via tritiated-
thymidine uptake.  The PA2024 proliferation responses over time will be compared between the 
concurrent arm and sequential arm using a repeated measurement analysis.  With 43 subjects per 
treatment arm (concurrent and s equential), there is 90% power to detect a 2.[ADDRESS_691048] been observed in a 
recent trial of sipuleucel-T in a similar population (data on file). 
8.3 Populations for Analyses 
The immune response population will be defined as subjects who receive 3 infusions of 
sipuleucel-T and 10 or more weeks of enzalutamide.  Analysis of immune response endpoints, 
including the primary endpoint, will be performed using this population.  This population will 
also be used to perform supplementary analyses of nonimmune response efficacy endpoints.  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects, regardless of whether 
they received treatment.  Analysis of nonimmune response efficacy endpoints will be performed 
using this analysis population. 
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_691049] 1 dose of enzalutamide.  All safety variables (e.g., AEs, laboratory data, and vital 
sign data) will be analyzed based on the safety population. 
8.4 Endpoints 
8.4.1 Primary Endpoint(s) 
The primary endpoint is peripheral PA2024-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel- T 
over time as measured via a T cell stimulation index from a proliferation assay.  This endpoint 
was selected because it has demonstrated the highest signal to noise ratio of all the T cell assays 
Dendreon has evaluated in prior studies of sipuleucel-T (data on file).  
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 48 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential 8.4.2 Secondary Endpoint(s) 
Immune responses over time for ELISPOT and ELISA are secondary endpoints as are peripheral 
PAP-specific T cell immune response to sipuleucel-T over time via a T cell stimulation index 
from a proliferation assay, and cytokine production by [CONTACT_532197].  Additionally, responder 
analyses by [CONTACT_532198], 
ELISPOT, and ELISA.  A positive response will be defined as having a post-baseline result 
exceeding a threshold value, determined on the basis of baseline and historical sipuleucel-T data, 
that ensures a sufficiently low false positive rate (i.e., 5% or less) for each immune response 
parameter.  The threshold will be antigen and assay dependent.   
Time to PSA progression is defined as: 1) the time from randomization to PSA progression, and 
2) the time from first enzalutamide treatment to PSA progression.  Those subjects who do not 
experience PSA progression will be censored in the analysis at the date of their last PSA 
assessment.  PSA progression, based on the randomization date (i.e., definition 1) will be defined 
for those subjects who experience a decline in PSA compared to baseline as the date that a 25% 
or greater increase in PSA and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more from the nadir is 
documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later ( Scher 2008 ).  
For those subjects who do not experience a decline in PSA compared to baseline, PSA 
progression is defined as the date a 25% or greater increase from the baseline value along with 
an increase in absolute value of 2 ng/mL or more after 12 weeks of enzalutamide treatment 
(Scher 2008).  PSA progression based on the first enzalutamide treatment (i.e., definition 2) will 
be defined in a similar manner except the most recent PSA value prior to the first enzalutamide 
treatment will be used as the baseline value. 
PSA progression time, based on the randomization date, will be calculated as follows for those 
subjects with PSA progression:  
Progression time (days) = [(PSA progression date) – (randomization date)] + 1. 
PSA progression time, based on the randomization date, will be calculated as follows for subjects 
who are censored:  
PSA progression time (days) = [last PSA assessment date –  (randomization date)] + 1. 
PSA progression time based on the first enzalutamide treatment will be defined in a similar 
manner except the first enzalutamide treatment date will be used instead of the randomization 
date. 
Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.  Those 
subjects alive at the time of database cut-off or lost to follow-up will be censored in the analysis 
at the earlier of the cut-off date or the day of their last documented visit or contact [CONTACT_568]. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 49 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Overall survival time will be calculated as follows for subjects who died prior to data cut-off:  
Survival time (days) = [(death date) – (randomization date)] + 1. 
Overall survival time will be calculated as follows for subjects who are censored: 
Survival time (days) = [(last contact [CONTACT_568]) – (randomization date)] + 1. 
8.4.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s) 
The time to next anticancer intervention is defined as the time from randomization to the first 
anticancer intervention.  Those subjects without an anticancer intervention will be censored at 
their last follow-up assessment when anticancer therapy information is collected. 
The time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_194607]-related pain is defined as the time from randomization to 
the first use of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_532158]-related pain.  Those subjects without a record of opi[INVESTIGATOR_194608]-related pain will be censored at their last follow-up assessment when opi[INVESTIGATOR_532159]-related pain is collected. 
The time to first ECOG performance status decline (i.e., increase in numerical value of ECOG 
performance status) is  defined as the time from randomization to the first decline in ECOG 
performance status by [ADDRESS_691050] disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_532199].  This 
summary will include, but will not be limited to, the following: 
 Number of subjects randomized. 
 Number of subjects infused.

unstructured, compound symmetry, heterogeneous compound symmetry, autoregressive (1), and 
heterogeneous autoregressive (1).  The variance-covariance structure providing the smallest 
Bayesian information criteria will be selected for the final model.  Fixed effect terms in the 
model will be tested for significance using type III sums of squares.  The formal test for 
difference between the treatment arms will be based on the p-value for the treatment arm effect 
unless a significant treatment by [CONTACT_23259] (p < 0.05) is observed, in which case by-visit 
treatment comparisons will be made using appropriate contrast statements.  Estimates of 
treatment effect and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided on the ratio 
scale obtained by [CONTACT_532200].  Immune responses over time for other assays will be analyzed using identical methods 
described for the primary efficacy analysis except for the ELISPOT,  which will be analyzed 
using ranks instead of on the logarithm scale. 
The response rate for each assay and for each antigen will be compared between treatment arms 
at each visit using Fisher’s exact test based on the immune response population.  In addition, 
analyses will be performed modeling response rates over time using appropriate methods to 
account for the correlation of responses over time within a subject. 
Time to PSA progression will be compared between the treatment arms using a Cox regression 
model with terms for treatment, baseline PSA (logarithm scale), and baseline LDH (logarithm 
scale) in the model based on the ITT population.  The estimated HR of the treatment effect and

APPENDIX 4 : INFUSION GUIDELINES 
Preinfusion Procedures 
DO NOT OPEN THE CLIMATE-CONTROLLED INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE 
SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_532168]. 
DO NOT INFUSE SIPULEUCEL-T UNTIL YOU RECEIVE WRITTEN APPROVAL 
SIGNED BY [CONTACT_532210] (IMF) 
QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) PERSONNEL VIA THE CLINICAL CELL PRODUC T 
DISPOSITION FORM (CPDF). 
Delivery Time Notification 
A courier service contracted by [CONTACT_532211]- T 
from the IMF to the clinical trial site infusion center. 
When the manufacturing schedule is determined for each subject, Dendreon Clinical Scheduling 
forwards a Subject Schedule Report to the Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), indicating the 
approximate delivery times for all [ADDRESS_691071] remain in the original, unopened shippi[INVESTIGATOR_256263], which is designed to 
maintain sipuleucel-T at 2ºC to 8°C until it is infused.  Quality control testing is performed on 
each sipuleucel-T product.  Due to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_532169], sipuleucel-T is 
routinely shipped to the infusion center before required QC release testing is complete.  
Dendreon’s QA personnel review the results and issue a written release called the CPDF, 
indicating whether the sipuleucel-T is “Approved” or “Rejected” for infusion, or if 
manufacturing was “Terminated” in process.     
The CPDF is faxed to the infusion center or pharmacy.  Upon receipt, the pharmacy, infusion 
staff, or CRC completes the section of the CPDF marked “Infusion Site Use Only” and faxes it to 
Dendreon at the number provided on the form.  This notifies Dendreon that the CPDF was 
received.  
If the sipuleucel-T does not meet Dendreon quality specifications and is rejected or terminated, 
Dendreon Clinical Scheduling contacts the clinical trial site to notify them of the sipuleucel- T 
 
PR-2303.00, [ADDRESS_691072]’s vital signs within [ADDRESS_691073]’s blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_532170].  
Sipuleucel-T Inspection and Expi[INVESTIGATOR_532171], open the polyurethane container 
and inspect the sipuleucel-T and the Final Product Label (FPL) affixed to the sipuleucel-T bag.  
The sipuleucel-T expi[INVESTIGATOR_532172].  The expi[INVESTIGATOR_532173].  Contact [CONTACT_532212][INVESTIGATOR_532174] .  Confirm the infusion 
will begin prior to the sipuleucel-T expi[INVESTIGATOR_532175].  If 
sipuleucel-T administration cannot begin prior to the expi[INVESTIGATOR_532176], do not 
infuse and contact [CONTACT_532213]. 
Occasionally, there is a delay in obtaining the CPDF due to operational or technical reasons. 
 If Dendreon indicates the CPDF is imminently pending, it is acceptable to administer the 
recommended premedications 30 minutes prior to the sipuleucel-T expi[INVESTIGATOR_242102].     
 If a CPDF marked “Approved” is obtained within [ADDRESS_691074] identifiers (name, initials, 
subject number, and lot or chain of identity [COI] number) on the CPDF and FPL match the 
intended subject.  Document this verification process in the subject’s medical record.  If any 
information on the CPDF or FPL is incorrect or is inconsistent, contact [CONTACT_532214]-T until the discrepancy is resolved.   
 
PR-2303.00, [ADDRESS_691075] the 
Dendreon Clinical Safety line.  
Sipuleucel-T Infusion Supplies 
Use a large-bore intravenous (IV) line suitable for blood transfusions to infuse sipuleucel-T; 18- 
or 20-gauge is recommended, but 22-gauge may be used when necessary.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_532177]-T infusions has a universal spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], a 10-20 drip/mL macro-drip chamber 
WITHOUT a cell filter, and a minimum of one injection port.  An infusion pump may be used, 
but is not required, to ensure the rate of infusion is controlled.   
Infusion Procedures 
DO NOT INFUSE SIPULEUCEL-T PRIOR TO RECEIPT OF A CPDF INDICATING 
SIPULEUCEL-T IS APPROVED FOR INFUSION.  
Sipuleucel-T Infusion 
Infuse sipuleucel-T over the shortest period that is well tolerated but not less than [ADDRESS_691076]’s medical record.  
If the subject develops an acute infusion reaction, slow the infusion and consult the section 
below on “Managing Acute Infusion Reactions” for recommendations regarding administration 
of additional medications.  It may not be necessary to immediately discontinue the infusion. 
If the infusion of sipuleucel-T is interrupted, do not resume the infusion if the sipuleucel-T bag 
will be held at room temperature for more than [ADDRESS_691077]’s medical 
record. 
Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Documentation 
Record all concomitant medications administered to the subject and all AEs. 
Document all concomitant medications administered, including all premedications, using the 
generic drug names, doses, routes, frequencies, indications, and start and stop dates in the 
subject’s medical record. 
 
PR-2303.00, 16 MAY 2013 Page 69 of 70                 Dendreon Corporation 
Proprietary and Confidential Describe any AEs, including start and stop dates (and duration if less than 24 hours), whether or 
not the event was serious, severity (based on the NCI CTCAE), relationship to sipuleucel- T 
(none, possible, or probable), and the outcome in the subject’s medical record. 
Refer to Section  7.[ADDRESS_691078] 30 minutes after the infusion.  Obtain vital signs within 30 
minutes (± 10 min) after completion of the infusion.  Document the subject’s blood pressure, 
heart rate, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_532178]’s medical record. 
Documentation 
Retain the original CPDF and file it in the subject’s medical record. 
Sipuleucel-T Return or Disposal 
Dispose of the sipuleucel-T bag and tubing according to institutional procedures for disposal of 
biohazardous waste that contains human blood.  Dispose of all packaging materials and gel packs 
appropriately.  
If instructed by [CONTACT_532188]-T, place the remaining sipuleucel-T in the 
original shippi[INVESTIGATOR_532179]. 
Managing Acute Infusion Reactions 
Refer to the current sipuleucel- T IB for a complete list of acute infusion reactions, including 
severity.  Some common acute infusion reactions, such as pyrexia and/or rigors (chills), may 
warrant slowing of the infusion rate.  If acute infusion reactions occur, the current infusion tim e 
and subsequent infusion times can be increased up to a total infusion time of 1.5 to 2.0 hours.  If 
the infusion of sipuleucel-T is interrupted, do not resume the infusion if the sipuleucel-T bag will 
be held at room temperature for more than 3 hours following removal from the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_34919].   
For subjects who experience a significant acute infusion reaction, including rigors, during or 
immediately following an infusion, the following guidelines may be helpful: 
 
PR-2303.00, [ADDRESS_691079] may be considered as an 
additional premedication. 
2. A narcotic such as meperidine may be used as treatment for an AE or as prophylaxis 
during subsequent infusions.   
3. Additional or other premedications may be considered according to institutional practices 
and/or local standards of care.  Steroids should not be used for premedication or 
treatment during sipuleucel-T infusions.  The use of steroids may suppress any 
immune response elicited by [CONTACT_102664]- T. 
4. For severe acute infusion reactions supportive care measures such as supplemental 
oxygen, bronchodilator therapy for wheezing, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_532180].

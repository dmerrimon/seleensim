Version 3: Date: 22Jun2021  [ADDRESS_263032], Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
 26-mL Applic ator will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_218875]. For dry surgical sites such as the abdomen or arm, the product will be applied for a period of at least [ADDRESS_263033]  surgical sites (such as the inguinal fold) for 2 minutes. The 
application area should be allowed to air dry for approximately 3 minutes.   
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  will be applied according to the 
prescribing information.  
Duration of Study: Each patient  will participate in the study for up to [ADDRESS_263034] -surgical follow -up for evidence of any SSI  or other AEs . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary  Efficacy Endpoint : The primary efficacy endpoint is  the occurrence of any SSI  within 30 days after 
surgery.  A secondary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint are subgroup analyses including: 
• Different types of SSI  classified as superficial incisional infection, deep incisional infe ction, or organ-
space infection  
• Clean (class I wound) or clean -contaminated (class II wounds) surgeries  
Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoints will be analyzed over the entire treatment and follow -up period.  
• AEs (including local application site reactions and allergic reactions)  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations:  The full analysis set includes all patients  who were randomized to study treatment, 
received the study treatment, and underwent surgery. The per -protocol (PP) subset includes all full analysis set 
patients  who had final follow -up at [ADDRESS_263035] -surgery. The safety subs et will include all patients who  were 
randomized to the study and received a study treatment and will be analyzed as they were treated.  
Statistical Analys es: All baseline data and efficacy and safety endpoints will be presented by [CONTACT_218902], standard deviation (SD) , 
median, minimum and maximum values for continuous variables. All data will be presented for all three of the analysis sets . 
AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms and will be grouped by [CONTACT_57501], organ, and class (SOC) designation. The severity, frequency, and relationship of AEs to investigational product s will be presented by [CONTACT_218903][INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
Listings of each individual AE including s tart date, stop date, severity, relationship, outcome, and duration will 
be provided. Each AE (based on preferred terminology) will be counted once only for a given study patient. If 
the same AE occurred on multiple occasions, the hig hest severity and relationship to investigational product 
will be assumed. Thus, study participants are not counted multiple times in a given numerator in the calculation 
of frequencies for a specific AE. The frequency and severity of skin irritation or allergic reactions at le ast 
possibly attributed to each product will also be presented.  The number and percentage of patients who were 
prescribed prophylactic antibiotics and antibiotics to treat an infection  as well as patient’s adherence to the 
 standard preop surgical instructions,  will also be summarized.

exceeds 13.2 in x 13.2 in (1126 cm2). 
6.4. Investigational Product Accountability 
Zurex requires Investigators to maintain accountability and adequate inventory security of the study material at all times. The Investigator or designee will: 
• Complete a Confirmation of Release and Receipt of Study Materials form upon receipt of the shipment and maintain and account for inventory on the Study Material Disposition form  
• Keep study materials in a secure storage area, accessible only to authorized 
individuals. 
• Dispense study material only to patient s properly enrolled into the study. 
• Return all unused study materials to Zurex Pharma, Inc. at the end of the study or 
dispose of unused study materials as agreed upon. 
7. Study Procedures  
7.1. Recruitment of Pati ents 
Patients anticipating undergoing clean (class I wound) or clean-contaminated surgery (class 2 
wound) will be identified during chart review. See Appendix A  for a description of wou nd 
classifications. If the potential participant is planning one of these procedures and otherwise 
appears to be eligible (e.g., ≥ 18 years old, no medical exclusions from chart review) , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_218879]/she will go 
through the informed consent procedure.  
7.2. Eligibility Screening  
Preliminary eligibility for study participation will be assessed  as described above. I f the patient 
appears to be an appropriate candidate for the study, a member of the study staff trained in 
human subjects’ protections will perform the informed consent process by [CONTACT_218904].  The study will be 
explained to the potential subject in lay terms and in a quiet, private setting. Potential subjects 
will be given as much time and privacy as necessary to review the informed consent and ask any

Version 2: Date: 15Apr2021  19  
Confidential   stratified permuted block randomization procedure will be performed via an interactive web -
based randomization system (IWRS) with type of surgery [ clean (class I wound) or clean-
contaminated (class II wounds) surgery ]) as the stratification variable.  
If the patient  is randomized and is never treated with one of the investigational products or never 
unde rwent surgery , then the patient  will be considered a randomization failure and an additional 
patient  will be randomized with the next randomization sequence a t the time he/she is 
randomized. The reason(s) that a patient  was considered a randomization failure or screen failure 
will be documented in source documents and e CRFs.  
7.4.2. Preoperative Surgical Instructions  
Each patient undergoing surgery at the MCW is instructed to shower with an antiseptic agent 
before the day of surgery. Additionally, the surgical staff follows standard preoperative surgical 
orders while preppi[INVESTIGATOR_218880]. The patient will be asked about adherence to the instructions before surgery  and the source documents will be checked for adherence to the 
standard preoperative surgica l orders /  activitie s the day of surgery.    
7.5. Interventions (Day 1) 
Patients will have the region surrounding the surgical site scrubbed with the assigned product as described in section 6.3. 
7.6. Assessments During the Inpatient Period  
During the post- surgical period while the patient is still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the surgical site and 
surrounding area will be examined for signs of infection or other deep incisional infection and if 
evident, this will be recorded. Local skin reactions (erythema, rash, or pruritus ) or other systemic 
allergic reactions  to the investigational product will be recorded. Other AEs will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_218905]: How are you feeling? If any antibiotics are prescribed 
for prophylaxis or treatment of an AE, these will be reported. On the day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
all of the above assessments will also be performed. The patient will be  given standard discharge 
instructions and a card with the name [CONTACT_218941] [CONTACT_218906]-
surgical complications. Patients will be scheduled for an examination appointment or possibly to come to the emergency room if any possibly serious complications have occurred.  
7.7. Assessments During the Outpatient Period  
If an o utpatient follow- up visit has been  scheduled, a physical examination should be performed 
including inspection of the surgical site for signs of an SSI and the skin at the application site for 
signs of an allergic reaction  and new antibiotic prescriptions. Other AEs should be assessed with 
an open ended question and data will be recorded.  
7.8. Telephone Assessment s 
Three- to-five days after  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218881], on study Day 30 or at any time a patient calls with a 
complaint,  a telephone scripted interview will be completed that assesses AEs and the patient  
should be queried if they had any other doctor’s office visits that might be indicative o f a post-
surgical problem indicative of an SSI or AE. If the patient cannot be contact[CONTACT_218907] 30, a 
person that they listed on the locator form should be called to determine if the patient died or is

(which involves any organ or space other than the incised layer of body wall that was 
opened or manipulated during the operation) (definitions in accordance with CDC -
2019  will be used). 
• SSI rates by [CONTACT_218908] (class I wound) or clean-contaminated (class II wounds) surgeries  
8.2. Safety  Endpoints  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed over the entire treatment and follow-up period. 
• AEs (including specifically local application site reactions and allergic reactions)  
9. Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety monitoring will be conducted throughout the study; therefore safety concerns will be 
identified by [CONTACT_218909], clinic staff, clinical monitor, medical 
monitor, and Zurex . 
The IRB, Medical Monitor, PI, Clinical Monitors and Zurex  will review any safety concerns 
throughout the trial. The roles of these individuals are described below. 
Medical Monitor: A Medical Monitor has been appointed for the study. The Medical Monitor 
will be available for making recommendations to the investigator and Zurex  on the severity of 
any SAEs, and the relatedness to the study interventions. The Medical Monitor will also be  
responsible for tracking and assessing trends in the AEs reported. 
Clinical Monitors: The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_218882], at 
mutually convenient times during and after the study, all study data. These monitoring visits 
provide Zurex  with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study and to obtain 
information about potential problems. The monitors will assure that submitted data are accurate 
and in agreement with any medical records or paper source documentation used; verify that 
investigational products are properly stored and accounted for, verify that patient s’ consent for 
study participation has been properly obtained and documented, confirm that research subjects 
entered into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assure that all essential 
documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed.  
Monitors will conduct a site initiation visit prior to the start of the study. At this visit, they will 
assure that proper study-related documentation exists, assist in training investigators and other 
site personnel in study procedures and GCP guidelines, confirm receipt of study supplies, and assure that acceptable facilities are available to conduct the study.  
Routine monitoring visits by [CONTACT_218910]’s representatives will be scheduled at appropriate intervals but more frequently at the beginning of the study. At these visits, the monitors will verify that study procedures are being conducted according to the protocol guidelines, monitor e CRFs 
against source documents, review AEs and SAEs, and perform drug accountability. At the end of the study, they will confirm that the site has the appropriate essential documents on file, advise on storage of study records, and inspect the return and destruction records for unused investigational products.

Confidential   10. Assessment  Methods  
All study assessments will be performed at the time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 3) that is somewhat flexible due to  different lengths of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_218883]. The following sections outline the details and 
procedures associated with  the assessments. All specified assessments will be recorded on a 
source document or the medical record and appropriate data will be transcribed into electronic case report forms (eCRFs) . 
10.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator and study site staff are responsible for the detection, documentation, classification, reporting, and follow up of events meeting the definition of an AE or SAE. 
10.1.1. Adverse Event  Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and may not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the administered treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational 
product. Pre-existing conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless there is a change in severity or frequency.  Planned surgeries will not be considered an AE. 
10.1.2. Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events  Definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one of the following: 
• Results in  death  
• Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in the risk information included in the Product Label for the drug. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study patient  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. 
10.1.3. Methods/Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Endpoints  
AEs will be assessed starting after the first administration of investigational product until the 
final follow -up at Day 30 . General symptoms will be collected via an open ended question: How 
have you been feeling since the last time we spoke? Elicited AEs will be assessed as described in 
section 10.1.4. 
Protocol Number: ZX -ZP-0113   Zurex Pharma, Inc.  
Comparative Evaluation of Pre -op products  
 
Version 2: Date: 15Apr2021  23  
Confidential   AEs will be documented in the medical/ source records, and recorded on the eCRF using 
accepted medical terms and/or the diagnoses that accurately characterize the event. When a 
diagnosis is known, the AE term recorded on the eCRF will be the diagnosis rather than a 
constellation of symptoms. The investigator will assess all AEs fo r seriousness, relationship to 
investigational product, and severity. When an event has not resolved by [CONTACT_138114], it will be 
documented on the AE CRF as “ongoing”. 
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed by [CONTACT_218911] (the event either resolved or stabilized and is not expected to resolve in the near term). At the follow-up telephone 
contact, AEs will be recorded and followed to resolution only if they are serious, or if the study 
physician assesses them to be clinically significant.  
10.1.4. Elicited Adverse Events  
In addition to asked the open ended question regarding AEs, local application site reactions will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_218912]. These include the appearance of 
erythema or rash, or patient reported pruritus (itching). 
10.1.5. Classification of Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Investigational 
Product  
For each recorded AE or SAE, a physician -investigator must make an assessment of severity  
according to the following criteria:  
Mild:  An event that is usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and does 
not generally interfere with the patient’s dai ly activities.  
Moderate:  An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the patient . The event is usually ameliorated with additional specific 
therapeutic interventi on. 
Severe:  
An event that interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical status. The event poses a significant risk of harm to the  
patient  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (prolonged) may be required, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_218884].  
Life-
threatening  An event that puts the patient  into imminent risk of death without 
intervention. 
The severity of application site reactions will be scored as shown in Table 4.

a Abbreviations: ADL = activities of daily living, BSA=body surface area.  The above scale is taken from the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0.  
The investigator must make an assessment of  relationship of the AE to the investigational 
product based on the following criteria: 
Unrelated:  The patient  did not receive the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational product is not reasonable, or there is another obvious cause of 
the AE/SAE.  
Unlikely:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product but there is 
another more likely cause of the AE/SAE. 
Possible:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal 
sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the 
investigational product is reasonable, but the AE/SAE could have been due to another equally likely cause. 
Probable:  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, and the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913]. 
Definite  
There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product, the temporal sequence of the AE/SAE onset relative to administration of the investigational product is reasonable, the AE/SAE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_218913], and the AE/SAE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the investigational 
product or investigational product class.  
10.1.6. Outcomes and Actions  Taken  
For each recorded AE or SAE, the investigator must make an assessment of outcome at the time 
of last observation, as follows: 
Fatal:  The patient  died.  
Resolved without Sequelae:  The AE or SAE has ended.  
Protocol Number: ZX -ZP-0113   Zurex Pharma, Inc.  
Comparative Evaluation of Pre -op products  
 
Version 2: Date: 15Apr2021  25  
Confidential   Resolved with Sequelae:  The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted 
from baseline.  
Unresolved – Ongoing:  The AE has not ended and is ongoing at the end of the 
reporting period or the investigator deems that further 
follow up is not medically required 
Unknown – Lost to Follow -up: Lost to follow -up at least 2  repeated , documented (15 
days apart)  unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_4677] . 
 
In addition, if the AE was treated (medications or other physical measures), this will also be 
recorded.  
10.1.7. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. 24-hour  Reporting Requirements (Initial  Report)  
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs to any patient  from the time of signing 
consent through the final follow -up telephone call whether or not related to the investigational 
product, must be reported within 24 hours  of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_149729]/SAE 
eCRF. This will trigger an automatic notification of the SAE via an email communication to 
Zurex and . will notify the Medical Monitor upon receipt of the 
notification and coordinate communications with the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 3-Day Supporting Documentation Requirements  
Written documentation for all SAEs must be received by  [CONTACT_218914] [ADDRESS_263048] be completed include the 
following: 
• AE/SAE eCRF ( revised if additional information is available ) 
In addition, scanned copi[INVESTIGATOR_218886].  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_41984]/ source documents pertinent t o the event (lab oratory  
reports, ECG tracings, medical chart notes, etc.). These should be identified only by 
[CONTACT_218915] (HIPAA). 
• Any other relevant information necessary to support the investigator’s judgment 
regarding the SAE’s relatedness severity to the investigational product OR by [CONTACT_218916]/Alternate.  
These paper documents may be submitted by [CONTACT_6972], as email attachments, or by [CONTACT_218917]’s eCRF casebook in the electronic data management system (EDMS).  
10.2. Demographics  
Demographics data include the patient’s age, gender, race, and ethn icity. These data will be 
collected by [CONTACT_218918] a source document and onto an e CRF.

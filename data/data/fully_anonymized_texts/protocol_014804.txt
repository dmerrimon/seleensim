Official Title: Prediction of Clinical Response to SSRI Treatment in Bipolar Disorder using Serotonin 1A Receptor PET Imaging Research Protocol Last approved by [CONTACT_26057]: 11/27/2020 Lay Summary of Proposed Research  Bipolar disorder is associated with alterations of chemicals in the brain, including one named serotonin. Treatment of depression in bipolar disorder can be accomplished by [CONTACT_257284] a type of medication named a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Serotonin signals in the brain occur through receptors in a way that is similar to a lock and key, where serotonin is a key and the receptor is a lock. One important receptor is the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor. This receptor has been found to be abnormal in bipolar disorder during periods of depression, as measured by a type of brain imaging called positron emission tomography (PET).  The amount of brain 5-HT1A receptor measured by [CONTACT_257285]. This project will measure the 5-HT1A receptors in bipolar depressed individuals using PET with the radiotracer [11C]-CUMI-[ADDRESS_312585] how patients respond to SSRI treatment when added to a mood stabilizer.  Background, Significance and Rationale  Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common psychiatric condition characterized by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_206115]. It is one of ten leading causes of disability worldwide and carries a significantly elevated risk for suicide. The pathophysiology of the disorder remains largely unknown and there are no imaging or diagnostic tests for the disorder. BD depression is the mood state most associated with disability and suicide, and patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_257262]. BD depression remains difficult to treat, with only three medications approved for its treatment. Moreover, treatment can only be given in a trial and error manner. For these reasons, there is a need for more knowledge of the pathophysiology of BD depression in order to design and select better treatment options. Several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), when combined with an anti-manic agent, for BD depression. Clinical trials of other SSRI’s have not demonstrated a class effect of the medications, however, despi[INVESTIGATOR_257263]. Treatment with SSRI’s also carries risks. A test to determine which patient with BD depression will respond to SSRI treatment would therefore be clinically useful. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows for the quantitation of serotonin receptor levels and affinity in the brain. The serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptor regulates serotonin neuron firing and release, and thereby [CONTACT_257286]. Our group developed a novel PET radiotracer for the 5-HT1A receptor, [11C] CUMI-101. This radiotracer has a straightforward and reliable synthesis process and is a partial agonist and therefore represents a technical improvement over [11C]WAY-100635 that has been previously used to measure binding to the receptor. [11C] CUMI-[ADDRESS_312586] binding in the 
autoreceptor. We found that PET imaging of the 5- HT1A receptor binding using [11C] WAY-100635 in BD depression found that high autoreceptor binding was associated with clinical remission from the disorder after patients received 3 months of naturalistic treatment. PET imaging with this radiotracer also found high autoreceptor binding to be associated with clinical response to antidepressant treatment in subjects with major depressive disorder. This protocol aims to evaluate whether PET scanning with [11C] CUMI-[ADDRESS_312587] clinical outcome after a protocol-driven six week treatment.  Specific Aims and Hypotheses  This protocol aims to evaluate whether PET scanning with [11C] CUMI-[ADDRESS_312588] clinical outcome after a protocol-driven six week treatment with an SSRI medication when added to a mood stabilizer medication. We hypothesize that higher brainstem raphe binding of [11C] CUMI-101 in the brain (BP) will predict a better clinical response to treatment. This result would be consistent with the finding that higher BP within the brainstem raphe of a similar radiotracer [11C] WAY-[ADDRESS_312589] population 18-60  Gender, Racial and Ethnic Breakdown  The target composition will be 75% White or Caucasian, 20% Black or African American, 5% Asian. Approximately 15% will be Hispanic and 85% will be non-Hispanic. 60% will be female and 40% will be male.  Describe settings where recruitment will occur  Patients will be recruited through referrals from treating outpatient psychiatrists, or from clinics, inpatient units and emergency department (ED) at Columbia University. Advertisements will be placed through the Columbia University website, on advertising sites such as Craig’s List, social medial websites and in print newspapers such as AM [LOCATION_001]. The study will be listed on Columbia's research study search engine, RecruitMe, and a website that describes the study will be created. Fliers will be posted around Columbia University Medical Center campus and the undergraduate campus at Morningside Heights. Outreach to mental health clinics, primary care clinics, support groups, community groups and facilities will be conducted in-person to best reflect the composition of the population in our city. Letters and fliers will be sent via mail or 
email to clinic directors of outpatient mental health clinics describing the study and asking for referrals. Messages will be posted on email list-serves of mental health clinicians describing the study and asking for referrals.  How and by [CONTACT_40402]/or recruited?  Study staff and investigators will contact [CONTACT_257287]. For patients in the ED or inpatient unit, only subjects who the clinical staff has identified as appropriate will be approached. The clinical staff will first ask the patient if he or she can be approached by [CONTACT_3647]. Only if the subject agrees to be approached will the staff from this study do so. All potential subjects will be given the telephone number of the research coordinators who will discuss the purpose and procedures of the research and screen the subjects for potential eligibility.

Research Procedures Valproate trial and medication washout: If patients are eligible to participate in the study, and if they are taking psychiatric medications at the time of recruitment, they will have all medications tapered off besides mood stabilizers indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder (specifically, either lithium, lamotrigine or valproate). If the subject is on a combination of any of these three mood stabilizers, they will continue with this combination for the study. The doses of  
the mood stabilizers will be changed as needed so that for one week before starting the SSRI medication one of the mood stabilizers will be in the therapeutic range - either serum level of lithium >0.6 mg/ml, serum level of valproate >40 mg/ml, or dose of lamotrigine greater or equal to [ADDRESS_312594] an effective anti-manic dose (serum level >40 mg/ml) for at least one week before starting SSRI medication. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_257266] 24 hours before the PET scan or MRI scan, and hypnotics will be permitted throughout the study. The patients will be off of all medications besides the mood stabilizer(s) for three weeks before PET scanning. This monotherapy treatment period is necessary to obtain imaging and clinical outcome data that are not significantly influenced by [CONTACT_257290]. This design also will allow us to measure the clinical response to an SSRI that is independent from a clinical response to starting valproate. Patients will meet with their psychiatrist at least weekly via phone or in person during this time. A CGI, HAM-D, YMRS and CSSRS will be performed at least weekly to detect new onset manic symptoms or clinical deterioration. Only patients who still meet the inclusion criterion of HAM-D>15, including the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_257267], at the clinical appointment one week before the scheduled PET scan will continue. Patients who no longer meet inclusion criteria at the end of the period, including those that are no longer sufficiently depressed, will not continue with imaging and will be offered up to 6 months of open label outpatient treatment.  Frequency of clinical visits: Throughout the study, outpatients will meet with a treating MIND psychiatrist at least once a week either in-person or on the phone. This meeting will be in-person at least once every other week. Subjects will do the washout on the [ADDRESS_312595] daily, except for weekends and holidays.  MRI/fMRI scans: All subjects will have an MRI of the brain prior to fluoxetine treatment to obtain information on brain structure and function. This information will help understand how brain structure, function and serotonin mechanism are inter-related. MRI scans will be obtained at the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_257268] a 3.[ADDRESS_312596] the option of visiting the MRI suite before the scan to enter a mock (fake) MRI scanner. The mock MRI scanner has the same dimensions as the real scanner so it allows participants to experience what it is like to be inside the actual magnet. The purpose of this is to have the subject be as comfortable as possible before the actual scan.  Patients will receive a combination of structural and functional MRI scanning lasting not more than 90 minutes. Structural scans will include T1-weighted, T2-weighted FLAIR and diffusion tensor imaging sequences. Resting state fMRI and arterial spin labeling MRI will be obtained to assess baseline brain activity while patients relax and focus their attention on a cross-hair in the field of view. The procedure will be immediately stopped if the subjects report significant distress. If the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_257269], the Neurological Institute’s MRI Center will be used.  PET imaging: Each subject will undergo a PET scan with [11C]-CUMI-[ADDRESS_312597] will be placed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_257270]. A head holder will be used to decrease head movement during the scan. A low dose computer tomography scan will be used to obtain data for attenuation correction. 16mCi or less of [11C]CUMI-[ADDRESS_312598] a clinical check in with a study physician within 48 hours of the PET scan for safety evaluation that will include an administration of the CSSRS.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: After imaging, patients will have baseline clinical rating scales. They will be started on fluoxetine or citalopram [ADDRESS_312599] weekly throughout the valproate optimization/medication washout and treatment phases. At each appointment, the clinician will administer the clinical global impression scale-I, the SAFETEE-GI and the CSSRS. If subjects receive a CGI-I of [ADDRESS_312600] such as medication adjustment. Subjects will receive Montgomerey Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), questions of BPRS related to psychotic symptoms, and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6. If subjects have no response in depression by [CONTACT_5875] [ADDRESS_312601] fluoxetine or citalopram levels checked at either week 4 to check for adherence. Patients will be asked about the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_257271]. Patients without alcohol or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_257272]/agitation (maximum dose equivalent to 4 mg of lorazepam per day). All patients may also receive zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_257273].  The medications that are started as part of study procedures (citalopram, fluoxetine or valproate) and all laboratory tests will be provided for free of charge to the participant. Patients will receive  six months of free outpatient treatment including the treatment obtained through this protocol, with treatment visits at least monthly. All outpatient follow-up visits and clinical assessments will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Martin Lan unless coverage is needed.  
The primary outcome of the study will be whether subjects have a greater than or equal to 50% change in MADRS score from baseline at any point in the six week trial. Subjects who achieve this will be considered “responders” and those that do not will be considered “non-responders”.  Eventually, “responders” will be compared to “non-responders” to evaluate differences in [11C] CUMI-101 binding potential in the brain. Scores of anxiety on the HAM-A and manic symptoms on the YMRS will also be evaluated for correlation with [11C] CUMI-[ADDRESS_312602] to follow up.  Criteria for Early Discontinuation  1) Intolerable side effects of medications 2) Refusal to continue regimen and willingness to receive open treatment  3) DSM-IV criteria for a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_257274] > 12 on the YMRS  4) During the washout/valproate monotherapy period, if subjects score a six (much worse) or seven (very much worse) on the CGI-I, the protocol will be discontinued. If the patients do not tolerate the washout because of marked agitation, severe anorexia such as inability to drink adequate amount of fluids or suicidal ideation or behavior with plan or intent, the protocol will be discontinued. In these cases, subjects will be offered open clinical treatment.  5) During the SSRI treatment phase, if there is clinical reason to change to open treatment, such as onset of psychotic symptoms, active suicidal ideation or a score on the CGI-I of 5 or 6 on two consecutive visits, the clinical team will evaluate whether the risks outweigh the benefits of continuing protocol.  6) If the patient requests withdrawal for any reason.  7) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_257275], for example if the subjects are unable to comply with the study procedures and rules.  Clinical treatment alternatives  
The proposed treatment is considered standard treatment. Several treatment guidelines for depression in bipolar disorder suggest a trial of either the olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-fluoxetine combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_257276], however. Other anti-manic agents also exist that could be used in place of valproate, including lithium, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_257277]. Valproate was chosen primarily because it has few effects on the serotonin signaling system, the scientific focus of the study.  Risks that could be encountered during the study period  1. Valproate initiation and washout period: Valproate has not been found to be effective on its own in treating depression in bipolar disorder. This medication needs to be started for patients not on any medications at the time of screening to limit the risks of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_257278]. It is possible that medications that patients are taking at the time of consent and that need to be tapered off as part of the research procedures are having a psychiatric treatment benefit. During this phase of changing medications to a mood stabilizer monotherapy, therefore, patients are at risk for worsening of the their depression or experiencing manic symptoms during the medication changes.  2. Discomfort during scanning (MRI and PET): It may be uncomfortable to lie motionless in the PET or MRI scanners and may cause some subjects to have anxiety.  3. MRI Scan: The MRI scanner takes images of the brain using a large magnet (3.0 Tesla). It is not associated with any known medical risks unless subjects have a heart pacemaker or metal in their body (ie. shrapnel or surgical prostheses) that can be affected by [CONTACT_40427]; medicinal patches can also cause burns in the magnet. There are no known risks associated with pregnancy but no one who is known to be pregnant will be scanned. Changes in the magnetic field of the scanner can stimulate peripheral nerves and sometimes cause sensations that are described as “tingling” or “twitching”, and can rarely cause a painful sensation. Some people feel nervous or claustrophobic feelings due to the scanner’s small space.  4. PET scan: There are some risks of exposure to radiation during the scan. For the [11C]CUMI- 101 compound, the single study exposure to the critical organ (pancreas in males) is 18.93 mGy (males) with the maximum proposed dose of 16 mCi (592 MBq). This is below the 5 Rem (50 mGy) single dose limit under the FDA guidelines 21CFR361.1. There is also a smaller exposure of radiation from the attenuation CT scan before the PET acquisition, significantly below the single dose limit under the FDA guidelines 21CFR361.1. The attenuation CT scan may have to be repeated only once if the subject leaves the scanner for any reason during the PET scan. In that scenario, the single study exposure will remain below the single dose limit under the FDA guidelines 21CFR361.1.  Maximum Proposed Dose of Radiation per PET scan and FDA Dose Limit per Single Study Exposure   Dosimetry Table for [C-11]CUMI-101 Exposure  

 * Critical organs  Summary Dosimetry Table for Entire Study  
 * Critical organs  5. Vascular access during PET scan: There is a small risk of infection or bleeding associated with intravenous catheters. A vasovagal reaction, which can include light-headedness, dizziness or more rarely, syncopy can occur with venous line placement. Syncopy is estimated to occur in <1% of phlebotomy procedures, but we have not found reports in the literature of its incidence for catheterization specifically.  6. Side effects of medications initiated as part of study procedures  a. Fluoxetine or citalopram: Potential side effects include nausea, sexual dysfunction (decreased sexual desire, anorgasmia or abnormal ejaculation), weight loss or gain, nervousness and/or insomnia, diarrhea or dry mouth. There is some risk that the SSRI will induce hypomania, mania or a mixed state.  

b. Valproate: Potential side effects include headache, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence, tremor, dizziness, weight gain, double or blurred vision or flu-like symptoms.  Valproate also has risk for rare but more serious reactions of hepatic failure, pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, hyperammonemia and multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions. Valproate is also teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy.  c. Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]: Potential side effects include diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, a drugged feeling and dry mouth  d. Lorazepam: Potential side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, a drugged feeling and some potential for tolerance or withdrawal symptoms  e. Diphenydramine: Potential side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, a drugged feeling and dry mouth  7. Interviews  Psychiatric interviews can be distressing at times, but some people find talking to a physician or psychologist helpful. All interviews will be performed by [CONTACT_215132].  8. Blood drawing: Drawing of blood will be performed with routine venipuncture procedures. These do carry minimal risk of physical discomfort, bleeding or bruising.  9. Pregnancy: Treatment with valproate is associated with teratogenicity and is considered contraindicated in pregnancy. For this reason, pregnancy is considered an exclusion criterion and will be evaluated at screening with a serum pregnancy test.  Describe procedures for minimizing risks  1. MRI scan: Subjects will have a screening interview before their scan with questions of whether they have a pacemaker or other metal in their body. Subjects will be asked to remove any medicinal patches from their body prior to scanning to avoid burns. Women of childbearing age will have a pregnancy test performed at the day of scanning. If the subject reports unpleasant sensations or feels uncomfortable during the scan, the MR technologist will stop the scan  immediately. Our research staff will be present at all times and a staff psychologist or psychiatrist will be available at all times should they be needed to comfort or treat the patient. From our experience, no subjects have had abnormal sensations that have persisted after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257279]. Because the MRI scan is designed for research purposes, it may not show problems that would be found on a clinical brain MRI scan ordered by a doctor for clinical purposes. However, the T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images acquired in this study, will be examined by [CONTACT_257291]. These scans may demonstrate gross structural abnormalities such as the presence of mass effects or hydrocephalus. Upon request, results will be shared with research subjects or a physician designated by [CONTACT_476].  2. PET imaging: To limit the risks of radiation exposure, subjects with radiation exposure in a research study in the previous year will only be included if the injected dose and dosimetry of 
the radiotracer are known and the cumulative annual exposure of the previous study and this study is lower than the annual limit for research subjects defined by [CONTACT_1622] (21 CFR 361.1, see below).  We have performed a number of studies to evaluate the safety of [11C] CUMI-101 including the FDA required toxicity study (intravenous) of CUMI-101 (CUNBID-101) in Sprague-Dawley rats sponsored by [CONTACT_186441] (NIMH) in the Toxicology Laboratory of SRI International. We proposed a total human dose of 10 microgram per injection and based on this dose male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (10/sex/group) were given a single iv dose of CUMI- 101 at 881 μg/kg (5286 μg/m2 , 1000 times the human dose, Group 2) or at 88.1 μg/kg (528.6 μg/m2, 100 times the human dose, Group 4), or 44.05 μg/kg (264.3 μg/m2, 50 times the human dose, Group 5) on Day 1 or twice a day at 440.5 μg/kg/injection (2643 μg/m2/injection, 500 times the human dose; total dose 881 μg/kg and 1000x human dose, Group 3). A control group (10/sex), Group 1, was given a single iv dose of vehicle, 5% ethanol in sterile saline, at an equivalent volume on Day 1. Animals were sacrificed on Day 3 or Day 15 (interim and terminal necropsy, respectively). The following parameters were evaluated for the toxicity evaluation: mortality/morbidity, clinical observations, body weights, food consumption, clinical pathology (hematology and serum chemistry), organ weights, and, at necropsy, macroscopic observation and microscopic histopathology. All animals survived until their scheduled necropsy. mid and high dose groups (Groups 2-4) displayed slight to moderate hypoactivity on Day [ADDRESS_312603] severity observed in the high dose group (Group 2). The animals recovered quickly from the hypoactivity within a few hours and appeared normal by [CONTACT_186442] 1. μg/kg (264.3 μg/mMale and female rats in the Rats in the low dose group at 44.05 2, 50x human dose) and the control group did not exhibit hypoactivity after dose administration. No drug-related effects were found for body weights, food consumption, organ weights, and macroscopic and microscopic evaluations. In conclusion, iv administration of CUMI-[ADDRESS_312604] level (NOAEL) is considered to be μg/kg (264.3 μg/m44.05 2) for a single iv dose administration. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is considered to be at least 881 μg/kg (5286 μg/m2) for a single iv dose administration. Although the groups with 1000-100 times human dose based on a 10 microgram showed only slight hypoactivity, we reduced the maximum injected mass of CUMI-101 to human subjects as 5 microgram per dose considering the no hypoactivity for a 50 times dose. Based on this dose the group 5 is now 100 times dosage based on a 5 microgram human dose and tolerate well in the toxicology studies. CUMI-101 has been successfully tested by [CONTACT_257292] 58 human volunteers, with >10 subjects receiving two doses of the tracer. No adverse effects were observed and the tracer gives a very reliable finding outcome measure with less than 10% CV on test retest. The total dose of [11C]CUMI-[ADDRESS_312605]. The safety of [11C]CUMI-101 in humans is supported by [CONTACT_257293]. Given a molecular weight of 371 g/mole, an injection of 13.0 to 20 mCi of [11C]CUMI-101with specific activity of ~1 to 2 Ci/μmol would be 2.4- 7.4 μg. The risk of an idiosyncratic reaction is acknowledged in the consent form. A physician will be present at the time of each injection of the radiotracer. Any adverse reaction to the radioactive drug (radiation related or not) will be reported to the IRB and JRSC at Columbia, as specified in 21 CFR 361.1 (d8) and the NYPSI IRB. [ADDRESS_312606] enough counts for reliable quantifications in lower binding regions, we seek an average dose of around 15 mCi.  3. Vascular access during PET scan: Placement of IV’s will be by [CONTACT_257294]. Any bleeding or hematoma formation will be treated with standard first aid procedures including application of pressure to the region. To reduce the risk of a vasovagal response, intravenous catheterization will be performed with subjects placed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], and subjects will be asked about a history of vasovagal responses with previous catherizations and blood draws.  4. Valproate optimization period: If the treating physician determines that treatment cannot be delayed safely, the patient will not be enrolled in the study.  5. Side effects of medications: Patients will be encouraged to report side effects of medications to their physicians. A rating scale for somatic symptoms, the SAFETEE-GI, will be administered regularly by [CONTACT_257295]. If the dose of fluoxetine or citalopram is increased to [ADDRESS_312607] a YMRS >12 or meet DSM-IV criteria for a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], they will be discontinued from the study and will be given appropriate anti-manic treatment.  6. Interviews: Patients will be informed prior to the interviews of the risks and the option of skippi[INVESTIGATOR_257280].  7. Blood drawing: Standard procedures for obtaining blood samples will be followed.  8. Pregnancy: Patients must agree at the time of consent to use a reliable form of birth control and to inform their treating psychiatrist if they become pregnant during the study. Pregnancy will be ruled out with a serum pregnancy test at screening. If the patient becomes pregnant during the study, they will not have imaging performed and all medications will be discontinued according to standard clinical practice, weighing the risks and benefits with the patient. Women will have a urine pregnancy test conducted on the day of the MRI scan to ensure pregnancy has not occurred since the screening. Women will also receive a urine pregnancy test at the time of PET scan to avoid radiation exposure in pregnancy and teratogenic effects of valproate. Women will also have a urine pregnancy test conducted within [ADDRESS_312608]’s consent. All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_186405]. Coded computer files will be stored in a database which is password protected and behind an institute and department firewall. In addition, subject names and other personal identifying information will be stored in an electronically secure database at [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute, the R2Net system for registration and tracking of research participants in the outpatient clinics. If information is transmitted electronically, it will be encrypted.  
Once a patient enrolls in the project he/she is given a code number that is used for all subsequent computer data and/or lab forms. The code list and patient names as well as all data are kept in locked files in locked offices with access limited to those directly responsible for maintenance of these files by [CONTACT_5051]. We will not apply for a Certificate of Confidentiality for this protocol.  The MRI report will be maintained as part of the clinical database at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute or Neurological Institute along with the subject’s name [CONTACT_257301]. For patients (only), their psychiatric diagnosis will not be part of the report. All subjects will receive feedback  about their scans. All results will be shared with research subjects in a manner that is consistent with the acuity and certainty of the finding, and will be communicated by [CONTACT_257296] a letter approved by [CONTACT_257297]. Results will be shared with the subject or a physician designated by [CONTACT_423].  Compensation and/or Reimbursement $250 for participation in the PET scan and $150 for participation in the MRI scan. Payment procedures are initiated at the time of completion of the scans. Payment is in the form of a check, usually received in the mail about 4-6 weeks after the research procedures.  References  Amsterdam, J. D. and J. Shults (2005).

Statistical Analysis Plan Statistics: Binding measures were analyzed first for the RN by [CONTACT_6486] a linear model with log(BPF) as outcome, using equal weighting of values.  Predictors included relevant pretreatment clinical variables.  Age and sex were considered as covariates, and they were removed from the model if they were not significant.  For analysis of data from multiple regions, a similar modeling strategy was taken, but fitting linear mixed effect models with participant as the random effect, and region also included as a fixed effect.   Prediction of clinical response was modeled linearly with MADRS score as outcome, controlling for initial MADRS score, and imaging or clinical predictors.  Demographic or clinical differences between clinical groups were calculated with student t-test or Fisher’s exact test.  Associations between outcome measure components and clinical variables were calculated using Pearson Correlation.  Significance was defined as p value less than 0.05 and all tests were two sided.  SPSS 12 for Mac OSX (www.spss.com) or R (www.R-project.org) were used for calculations.

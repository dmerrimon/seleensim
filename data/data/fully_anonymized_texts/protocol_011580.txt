CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIALSTUDY SYNOPSIS
Study Title: A Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinic al 
Trial of BBI608 plus Weekly Paclitaxel vs. Placebo plus Weekly 
Paclitaxel in Adult Patients with Advanced, Previously Treated 
Gastric and Gastro-Esophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
Study Number: BBI608-336 
Study Phase: III
Study Drug: BBI608 is a novel investigational orally administered small mol ecule 
anticancer drug that targets cancer stem cells (CSC). CSC are co nsidered 
to be fundamentally responsible for malignant growth, relapse, 
metastasis, and resistance to conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. BBI608 bl ocks 
CSC self-renewal and induces cell death in CSC as well as non-s tem 
cancer cells by [CONTACT_768950]3, ȕ-catenin and Nanog pathways. 
BBI608 has shown potent anti-tumor and anti- metastatic activities in 
pre-clinical gastric cancer models, and has shown highly synerg istic 
effect in combination with paclitaxel.
In a Phase Ib/II clinical trial, BBI608 in combination with week ly 
paclitaxel has been safely administered to more than 80 patients , with 
the Recommended Phase 2 Dose of BBI608 determined to be the ful l 
monotherapy dose. Adverse event (AE) profiles were similar to t hat of 
both agents in monotherapy, with no new or additive effects see n. 
BBI608 related AEs were generally gastrointestinal in nature, a nd most 
frequently CTCAE Grade 1 or Grade 2. Encouraging signs of activ ity 
were observed in patients with gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, with  
disease control in 6 of 7 patients, objective response in 3 of 7  patients 
(partial responses of 44%, 48%, and 100% respectively), and a m edian 
progression free survival of 23 weeks. Survival data is maturing .
Primary 
Objective:To compare overall survival (OS) of patients with pre-treated, advanced 
gastric and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma treated 
with BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel versus placebo plus weekly 
paclitaxel.  OS is defined as the time from randomization until  d e a t h  
from any cause.  
Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety profile of BBI608 administered daily plu s weekly 
p a c l i t a x e l  i n  p a t i e n t s  w i t h  p r e - t r e a t e d  a d v a n c e d  g a s t r i c / G E J  
adenocarcinoma, with safety assessed according to the National Cancer 
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCA E)
version 4.0. 
Study Design: This is a study which began as a randomized, double-blind, mult i-center, 
phase III study of BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel vs. placebo pl us 
weekly paclitaxel for adult patients with advanced, pre-treated  gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma who have failed first line therapy containing a 
fluoropyrimidine and a platinum-based agent. At the time of this 
amendment, patients remaining on study treatment will be unblin ded 
and the study will continue as a randomized, open-label, multi- center, 
phase III study of BBI608 plus weekly paclitaxel vs. weekly pac litaxel

present); and prior taxane therapy (yes vs. no). 
Until the time of this amendment, the study proceeded in 28-day (4-
week) cycles.  BBI608 or placebo was administered orally, twice  daily, 
with doses separated by 12 hours.  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2IV was
administered weekly, on day 1, 8, and [ADDRESS_1054831] by [CONTACT_768951]’s i nformed 
consent. Placebo will no longer be administered. 
Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks after 
randomization until objective disease progression.   
Study Population: This study will enroll patients with a cytological or histologi cally 
confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal ju nction 
(GEJ) that is metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable. Pa tients 
will have failed treatment with one regimen containing a t least a 
platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet  for unresectable or metastati c 
disease.  
Patients who have received prior taxane therapy may be enrolled , so
long as the taxane was administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
setting and progression occurred more than 6 months following 
completion of therapy.

Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: Until the time of this amendment, patients in this study receiv ed BBI608 
or matched placebo orally, daily, at 480 mg bid ( 960 mg total daily 
dose). In each cycle BBI608 was taken daily for 4 weeks (28 day s). 
BBI608 or placebo was administer ed twice daily, one hour prior or two

paclitaxel is discontinued due to toxicity, BBI608 may be conti nued as 
monotherapy until another discontinuation criterion is met. If B BI608 is 
discontinued due to toxicity, paclitaxel should be continued as  
monotherapy until another discontinuation criterion is met. The study is 
planned to close on September 15, 2017, at which time study med ication 
will no longer be provided. 
Statistical Methods: The primary study endpoint is Overall Survival (OS).  The study  i s  
designed to have a power of 90% and a two-sided alpha of 5% to detect 
a 24% reduction in the continuous risk of death (HR 0.76, which 
corresponds to an increase of median survival from 7.36 to 9.67  months) 
in the Intention to Treat (ITT) general study population. It is estimated 
that [ADDRESS_1054833] this reduction which would be 
observed by [CONTACT_4296] 700 patients over 24 months and following 
them for an additional 12 months (including up to 5% of yearly 
dropouts).  
There was one interim analysis in this study presented to the 
independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). Additional ly, 
DSMB reviewed safety during conduct of the study. The role and 
responsibility of the DSMB was defined in a separate Charter.
The interim analysis was performed on OS, the primary endpoint of this 
study, when at least 2/3
rdsof the required number of events (380) have 
been observed. This analysis, based on the stratified log- rank test 
adjusting for the stratification variables at randomization, te sted the

The comparison of the overall population was tested based on a 
generalization of the Lan-DeMets error spending function approac h 
using an O’Brien-Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_768918] H 0, controlling 
for a two-sided alpha of 5 % at the end of the study. For example, if 
exactly 380 deaths (67% of the required events) were in the lock ed 
database for the interim analysis, the nominal critical point f or rejecting 
H0would be 2.502, corresponding to a p-value of 0.012.  Thus H [ADDRESS_1054834] is < 0.012.

CONFIDENTIAL 9 CONFIDENTIAL2BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE
2.1 GASTRIC AND GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION (GEJ) CANCER
Gastric cancer and cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction (GE J )  a r e  a  s i g n i f i c a n t  c a u s e  o f  
morbidity and mortality worldwide and have the second highest de ath rate of all cancers with 
736,000 deaths recorded in 2008 [WHO, 2013] . Combined, they are the fourth most prevalent 
malignancy with nearly 1,000,000 new cases of gastric and GEJ c ancer diagnosed annually 
worldwide [Ferlay 2008] . In the [LOCATION_002], 21,600 new cases of gastric and GEJ canc er are 
estimated for 2013 with 10,990 dying from the disease [NCI 2013] . Surgery is considered the 
only potentially curative treatment, however, more than 70% of patients present with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease [Sugano 2008] . Out of the minority of presenting patients who 
qualify for curative surgery, most will develop disseminated ad vanced disease with a 5-year 
survival rate of only 20-25% [Arak  1994; Cunningham 2006] .
Standard treatment for unresectable and metastatic disease curren tly includes first-line 5-
fluorouracil (5-FU) and platinum chemotherapy based regimen (+/-  human epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] 2 (HER-2) antibody) with patients ultimately pr ogressing on first-line therapy or 
exhibiting primary refractory disease leading to a median survi val between 9 and 14 months 
[Cunningham 2008; Wagner 2006; Wagner 2010] . A meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_1054840]-line treatment option for advanced gastri c and GEJ cancer in the US and 
Europe [Wagner 2010] . A subsequent randomized phase 2 study, however, showed no ben efit 
with the addition of an anthracycline to a 5-FU and platinum reg imen [Enzinger 2010] .  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_768921], the past  decade has seen some progress in 
second-line therapy for this disease with approximately 20-50% of patients receiving second-line 
therapy world-wide [Pozzo 2004; Bouche 2004; Chau 2004a; Lee 2007] . Second-line therapy has 
shown a median survival of 5.[ADDRESS_1054841] -line therapy [Chau 2004a] . Three 
recent randomized phase III studies provide evidence to support  the use of second-line therapy in 
advanced gastric and GEJ cancer, showing survival benefit of sin gle agent docetaxel and 
irinotecan [Kang 2012; Thuss-Patience 2011; Cook 2013] . A meta-analysis of these three 
second-line gastric cancer trials (including a total of 410 pat ients) reported a significant reduction 
in the risk of death with a HR of 0.64 (CI 0.52-0.79 and P<0.00 01) with administration of either 
docetaxel or irinotecan chemotherapy [Kim 2013] . A recently published study of paclitaxel 
compared with irinotecan shows that the two treatments have simi lar effects on overall survival, 
progression free survival and response rate. Additionally, pacl itaxel was shown to have a superior 
safety profile to irinotecan with respect to gastrointestinal a dverse events such as anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [Hironaka 2013] . In addition to improvements in survival, 
second-line therapy has also led to improvement in patient qual ity of life and significantly 
improved symptom scores for pain [Cook 2013] . 
In 2013, ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-[ADDRESS_1054842], was reported to improve 
overall survival by 1.4 months as monotherapy in the second-lin e setting [Fuchs 2013], adding 
anti-angiogenic therapy to the gastric and GEJ cancer therapy a rmamentarium. Ramucirumab has 
also been studied in combination with weekly paclitaxel in the s ame patient population in the

2.2 CANCER STEM CELLS (CSC) AND GASTRIC AND GEJ CANCER
CSCs or cancer cells with stemness phenotypes are a sub-populat ion of cancer cells that have 
self-renewal capability, are highly malignant, and are consider ed to be fundamentally responsible 
for malignant growth, recurrence, drug-resistance and metastasi s. Moreover, CSCs are highly 
resistant to traditional chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_768922]. CSCs have been isolated from 
almost all major tumor types, including gastric cancer [Takaishi 2007A] . Targeting stem cells, 
therefore, holds great promise for fundamentally advancing canc er treatment.
Accumulating evidence indicates that CSCs play a key role in th e pathogenesis of gastric cancer 
[Takaishi 2008] . Cancer stem cells have been isolated from human gastric cance r using cell 
surface markers such as Lgr5 and CD44 [Barker 2010; Takaishi 2009] . These CSCs isolated 
from gastric and GEJ cancer patients display tumour-initiating properties, as well as resistance to 
chemotherapeutic agents. These findings suggest that the develo pment of cancer stem cell 
inhibitors represents a novel and compelling strategy for the t reatment of gastric and GEJ cancer.

disease. The gp130F/F mouse model for gastric cancer results in STAT3 hyper-activation , and 
these animals spontaneously develop gastritis and gastric tumor s within 6-8 weeks [Judd 2006; 
Ernst 2008] . Another mouse model, the T3b-SOCS3 cKO mouse, develops STAT3- mediated 
gastritis and gastric tumors within 8 weeks [Inagaki-Ohara 2012]. In particular, approximately 
20 to 50% of gastric and GEJ cancers feature dysregulation of S TAT3 signaling [Yu 2009; Tye 
2012, Gong 2005; Yakata 2007] . Moreover, activation of STAT3 pathway, as assessed in 
archival patient tumor samples, has been associated with reduce d survival [Kim 2009; Yakata
2007; Gong 2005; Lee 2009; Kanda 2004] . These data provide strong rationale for the 
development of gastric and GEJ cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_768923]3 activity.
2.4 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BBI608 IN PATIENTS WITH GASTRIC AND GE J CANCER
Based on compelling pre-clinical data, a Phase Ib/II study was i nitiated to evaluate the safety, 
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary signs of activ ity of BBI608 administered in

CONFIDENTIAL 11 CONFIDENTIALcombination with weekly paclitaxel in several solid tumors, inc luding gastric/GEJ cancer. This 
study showed that BBI608 can be combined safely with weekly pac litaxel, with the RP2D of 
BBI608 in this combination determined to be the full monotherap y dose (480 mg, twice daily). 
The Adverse Event (AE) profile is similar to that of both agent s in monotherapy, with no new or 
additive effects observed.  AEs possibly related to BBI608 were generally mild, consisting 
primarily of Grade 1 and 2 diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.  
To date, 7 subjects with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer have been e nrolled in this study. All 
patients had been pre-treated, with most having received multip le lines of therapy in the 
metastatic setting, including prior taxanes. The Disease Control  Rate (DCR) and Objective 
Response Rate (ORR) for BBI608 in combination with paclitaxel in the gastric/GEJ cancer
patients was found to be 6 of 7 enrolled and 3 of 7 enrolled, res pectively. Three patients had a 
partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 (100%, 45% and 48% regress ions of target lesions), and 
the additional three patients had prolonged stable disease (SD) —one with 25% regression.  
Historically, a DCR of approxima tely 40-60% and an ORR of appro ximately 5-21% have been 
observed in this setting with taxane monotherapy [Ford 2012; Graziano 2000; Kodera 2007; 
Hironaka 2013;Wilke 2014]. Furthermore, for these patients, median Progression Free Surviv al 
(PFS) was approximately 23 weeks,  which compares favorably with the median PFS (11.4
weeks) observed with weekly paclitaxel alone [Wilke 2014] . The phase II portion of the trial is 
ongoing, with enriched accrual of patients with previously treat ed gastric and GEJ cancer.
Currently, BBI608 combined with weekly paclitaxel has been admi nistered safely to more than 
[ADDRESS_1054846] line chemotherapy. Additional assessments will include Progression-Free 
Survival, Objective Response Rate, Disease Control Rate, Safety , Quality of life (QoL), 
Population Pharmacokinetics and putative predictive molecular m arkers.

CONFIDENTIAL 12 CONFIDENTIAL3BACKGROUND THERAPEUTIC INFORMATION
3.1 NAME [CONTACT_768992]608 
3.2 MECHANISM OF ACTION
BBI608 is a cancer stem cell (CSC) inhibitor. One of the hallma rks of CSCs is their ability to 
self-renew [Al-Hajj 2004] .A standard method of measuring self-renewal capacity is to asse ss the 
ability of CSCs to be cultured as spheres in the absence of ser um or attachment [Ponti 2005; Cho 
2008] .Treatment with BBI608 potently blocks in vitro sphere formation by [CONTACT_768956], as well 
as other types of CSCs. Moreover, BBI608 has also been shown to  target CSCs in vivo .
Treatment of nude mice bearing human tumor xenografts with BBI6 [ADDRESS_1054847] discovered that STAT3 is c ritical for the self-renewal and 
survival of cancer stem cells. Under normal conditions, STAT3 a ctivation is transient and tightly 
regulated in normal adult cells and adult stem cells. While ess ential for embryonic development, 
STAT3 deficiency is well tolerated in adult mice [Niwa 1998] .Moreover, conditional knock-out 
of STAT3 in mice is associated with undetectable or mild phenot ypes [Akira 1999] .Patients with 
Job’s syndrome also survive wel l with STAT3 dominant negative m utations [Holland 2007] .  
Increased levels of phospho-STAT3, the activated form of STAT3,  are observed in both 
preclinical gastric cancer models as well as in human gastric c ancer. Multiple animal models of 
gastric cancer support the role of STAT3 pathway activation in this disease. The gp130F/F mouse 
model for gastric cancer results in STAT3 hyperactivation and t hese animals spontaneously 
develop gastritis and gastric tumors within 6-8 weeks [Judd 2006; Ernst 2008] . In another mouse 
model, the T3b-SOCS3 cKO mouse, develops STAT3-mediated gastrit i s  a n d  g a s t r i c  t u m o r s  
within 8 weeks [Inagaki-Ohara 2012].  Approximately 20 to 50% of gastric and GEJ cancers 
feature dysregulation of STAT3 signaling [Yu 2009; Tye 2012, Gong 2005; Yakata 2007] .  
Moreover, activation of STAT3 pathway, as assessed in archival patient tumor samples, has been 
associated with lower patient survival [Kim 2009; Yakata 2007; Gong 2005; Lee 2009; Kanda 
2004] . These data demonstrate that STAT3 is an important regulator of  gastric and GEJ cancer 
proliferation and survival, as well as a key regulator of CSC-m ediated invasion and metastasis. 
Moreover, they establish a powerful rationale for the developme nt of gastric and GEJ cancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_67386]3 activity. 
STAT3 is closely linked to another important transcription fact or RQFRJHQH ȕ -catenin, the 
HIIHFWRURIWKH:QWVLJQDOOLQJSDWKZD\ȕ -catenin contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis in a

supporting the idea that Wnt pathway activation may play a role  in the initiation of gastric and

Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-[ADDRESS_1054848] s to promote tumor development 
in gastric mucosa of the animals [Oshima 2006] . Moreover, Lgr5, a recognized gastric cancer 
stem cell marker, is a Wnt pathway target gene [Van der Flier LG 2007] , and increased Wnt 
signalling leads to accumulation of Lgr5 positive self-renewing , multi-potent stem cells 
responsible for long term renewal of the gastric epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] [Barker 2010] .
In addition to the over- H[SUHVVLRQ RI ȕ -catenin, its localization has important clinical 
implications. 0HPEUDQRXVȕ -catenin is involved in maintaining cell-cell junctions and pro moting 
a less-aggressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_313463]. By [CONTACT_22242], nu FOHDUȕ -catenin is accumulated in human 
gastric cancer tumors [Brabletz 2005, Clements 2002, Nakatsuru 1992, Park 1999] and has been 
correlated with an invasive phenotype in intestinal-type gastri c cancers [Miyazawa 2000] .
Although nuclear E-catenin translocation (with or without demonstrated E-catenin mutations) has 
been reported in gastric cancer, the actual incidence has varie d greatly among studies with 
approximately 30-50% of tumors showing nuclear accumulation of E-catenin [Clements 2002, 
Park 1999, Ebert 2002] .  
A US based study evaluating [ADDRESS_1054849] of all 
gastric tumors show E-catenin nuclear localization, with E-catenin mutations occurring equally 
among the diffuse and intestinal types of gastric and GEJ cancer  [Clements 2002] .AK o r e a n  
study looking at 598 gastric cancer samples reported nuclear E-catenin incidence of 20% in 
intestinal gastric cancer and 84% in diffuse type of gastric ca ncer, with 86% of more advanced 
stage gastric cancers of both histologic types exhibiting nucle ar E-catenin staining. A separate 
s t u d y  r e p o r t e d 2 4 %  o f  e a r l y  s t a g e  g a s t r i c  c a n c e r s  a n d 8 0 %  o f  l y m p h node metastases of both 
histologic types of gastric cancer showing nuclear E-catenin translocation [Kim 2009] . A recent 
study from China looking at 144 gastric cancer samples reported a nuclear E-catenin frequency of 
56% with presence of nuclear E-catenin denoting a worse prognosis for overall survival [Liu 
2012].  A 1997 study evaluating 89 gastric carcinomas reported a statis tically significant 3-5 fold 
survival advantage in patients retaining normal membranous E-catenin staining irrespective of 
histologic type, grade or stage of gastric cancer [Jawhari 1997] . Although the reported incidence 
of nuclear E-catenin staining varies in the literature, these studies demon strate the presence of 
abnormally elevated levels of nuclear E-catenin in gastric and GEJ cancer and correlate nuclear E-
catenin localization with more advanced disease as well as decr eased survival.  This provides a 
strong rationale for the development of gastric and GEJ cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_768925] E-catenin 
nuclear localization.  
Studies conducted at [LOCATION_011] Biomedical have shown that BBI608 c an directly inhibit 
phosphorylated STAT3, and also blocks the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 in cancer cells. 
Moreover, treatment of cancer cells with BBI608 inhibits STAT3 reporter gene activity in a dose-
dependent manner. The ability of BBI608 to inhibit STAT3 nuclea r translocation in 
heterogeneous cancer cells and CSCs has also been demonstrated by [CONTACT_768957]. BBI608 treatment was also found to result in decreased  STAT3-dependent gene 
H[SUHVVLRQLQFDQFHUFHOOVLQFOXGLQJȕ -catenin. Furthermore, BBI608 has been shown to decrease 
ȕ-catenin levels in in vivo gastric cancer models (BBI’s unpublished data).

since bulk cancer cell progeny retain dependency on STAT3 as CS Cs, BBI608 has demonstrated 
inhibitory activities against a broad spectrum of heterogeneous cancer cells including those 
derived from pancreas, lung, cervix, breast, colon, head and ne ck, and prostate, as well as 
hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma, leukemia , and lymphoma (with IC 50

BBI608 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity as a monothe rapy in vivo in murine

BBI608 has also shown potent anti-tumor activity in a variety o f other human cancer xenograft 
models including colorectal (including k-Ras mutant), pancreatic, head and neck, breast, prostate,

3.4 GLP TOXICOLOGY STUDIES (28-DAY & 90-DAY)
BBI608 was evaluated in 28-day repeat-dose GLP toxicology studi es in both rats and dogs. Both 
species received BBI608 at dose levels of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/ day for 28 days followed by a 
14-day recovery period. In both species, adverse events were ob served in the high dose (100 
mg/kg) groups. Male rats in the 100 mg/kg group showed body wei ght loss, diarrhea, and 
decreased food consumption. Female rats in the 100 mg/kg group experienced weight loss only, 
which stabilized after the first week. In dogs in the 100 mg/kg g roup, weight loss, emesis, 
diarrhea, and soft/mucoid feces were observed in both males and  females. Clinical pathology and 
histopathology findings in rats at high dose were consistent wi th dehydration and diarrhea. There 
were no related pathologic or hist opathological findings in dog s at any dose level.  
Under the conditions of the study, the 28-day oral NOAEL (no ob served adverse effects level) in 
both rats and dogs was 30 mg/kg. From the rat NOAEL, conversion  to a human equivalent dose 
(HED) yields 180 mg/m2; and from the dog NOAEL, the HED is 600 mg/m2. This dose 
corresponded to BBI608 plasma levels in both species above the in vitro IC50, with exposure 
lasting beyond 10 hours.

receiving 40 mg/kg/day. Clinical pathology changes included mini mal decreases in total protein, 
albumin, and calcium in males and females given 40 mg/kg/day, a nd minimal to mild increases in
total white blood cell counts and associated absolute neutrophi l and absolute lymphocyte counts
in males and females given 40 mg/kg/day. Treatment-related micr oscopic findings in rats given 
40 mg/kg/day included: minimal to mild transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_768926]; minimal to moderate epi[INVESTIGATOR_126308], hyp erkeratosis, inflammatory cell

8.1 TREATMENT PLAN
Palliative and supportive care for other disease-related sympto ms and for toxicity associated with 
treatment will be offered to all patients on this trial. Detail s of interventions (e.g. medications 
such as antibiotics, analgesics, antihistamines, steroids, G-CS F, erythropoietin), procedures (e.g. 
paracentesis, thoracentesis), or blood products (e.g. blood cel ls, platelets, or fresh frozen plasma 
transfusions) should be recorded on the case report forms.
8.1.1 BBI608 Adverse Event Prophylaxis 
Gastrointestinal Prophylaxis 
The major adverse events associated with the use of BBI608 are g astrointestinal events (nausea, 
diarrhea, and abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and fatigue. Fatigue is often  secondary to gastrointestinal 
events. There is no hematologic toxicity associated with BBI608 . We recommend that pre-exiting 
laxative bowel regimens, such as stool softeners, be held starti ng the day prior to first dose of 
study treatment and may be resumed in cases of no bowel movemen t during the first [ADDRESS_1054887] ementation may be continued. Add itionally, prophylactic anti-
diarrheal medications, such as Loperamide and/or Diphenoxylate/ Atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], starting 1 day prior to 
start of BBI608 are strongly recommended for all patients. Detail s regarding the use of 
prophylactic medication for the management of common BBI608 rel ated gastrointestinal adverse 
events are specified in the supplementary Adverse Event Managem ent handout as well as in the 
Pharmacy Manual.
No hematologic toxicity relat ed to BBI608 treatment has been ob served.

The guidelines which follow outline dosing modifications and rec ommended interventions should 
the above adverse events occur. 
Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0 (see Appendix III).  If a patient experiences  several adverse events and 
there are conflicting recommendations, please use the recommend ed dose adjustment that reduces 
the dose to the lowest level.

** If paclitaxel dose is required to be reduced below 40 mg/m2, or if any life-threatening paclitaxel-related events occur, 
paclitaxel should be permanently discontinued.
When laboratory parameters indicate that the dose of paclitaxel  should be delayed, the 
infusion of paclitaxel scheduled for that day is not given.  Th e infusion is considered 
“missed”, and is not made up at another time.  The next paclita xel infusion would be

8.1.7 Concomitant Medications/Procedures 
Permitted Treatments:
All information regarding concomitant treatments (medications o r procedures) must be recorded 
on the patient’s CRF (including the name [CONTACT_768993] p rocedure and duration of 
treatment). 
As per the Summary of Product Characteristics for paclitaxel, a lthough CYP2C8 inhibitors or 
inducers are permitted, caution should be exercised when co-adm inistering these agents with 
paclitaxel. Similarly, caution should be exercised while co-adm inistering CYP1A2 inhibitors 
and/or substrates of CYP e nzymes 1A2, 2D6, 2C19 a nd 3A4 with BB I608. 
Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms wil l be offered to all patients. 
All palliative and supportive care measures may be administered  to patients in either study arm at 
the Investigator’s discretion. Incident palliative radiotherapy  is permitted in both study arms 
while on study, but requirement of radiation to the target lesi on(s) will qualify the patient as 
having disease progression.
Although patients will have either metastatic or locally advanc ed but unresectable disease at 
randomization, it is possible that a patient’s tumor may become  operable over the course of 
treatment. Resection is allowed, and it is recommended that pac litaxel be held for [ADDRESS_1054898]-surgic al recovery, whichever is longer.
BBI608 should be held 24 hours pri or to the surgery to 1 week aft er the surgery as tolerated. 
Non-Permitted Treatments:
Concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (except corticosteroids ), immunotherapy, biologic 
therapy OR other experimental agents should not be given to stu dy patients while on protocol 
treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL 42 CONFIDENTIAL10CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT OF STUDY ENDPOINTS
10.1 DEFINITIONS
10.1.1 Evaluable for Adverse Events: All patients who have received at least one dose of 
BBI608/placebo will be evaluable for adverse events from the ti me of their first dose of 
BBI608/placebo. 
10.1.2 Evaluable for Overall Survival (OS): All randomized patients will be included in the analysis of 
OS, which is defined as the time interval between the date of r andomization and the date of death 
from any cause. Patients who are still alive at the time of the  final analysis, or who have become
lost to follow-up will be censored at their last date known to be alive.  
10.1.3 Evaluable for Progression Free Survival (PFS): All randomized patients will be included in the 
analysis of PFS, which is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the 
date of objective disease progression or death, whichever comes  first. If neither event has been 
observed, then the patient will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.
Disease progression is defined as objective progression per REC IST 1.1 [Eisenhauer 2009] .I t  i s  
required to perform, whenever possible, a radiological confirma tion of the clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_210219]. In the situation where there is clinical sus pi[INVESTIGATOR_768939] 1.1, disease is def ined as clinical deterioration 
without objective evidence of progression.  
The date of disease progression is defined as the date when the  criteria for objective progression 
are first met. 
10.1.4 Evaluable for Objective Response Rate (ORR): Patients with measurable disease by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
at randomization will be included in the analysis of ORR which is  defined as a composite of 
Partial Response and Complete Response as classified according to the definitions set out below 
[Eisenhauer 2009] .For patients who discontinue protocol therapy prior to their fi rst objective 
assessment of response, it is imperative that an objective resp onse assessment be undertaken as 
close to the protocol specified schedule as possible. 
10.1.5 Evaluable for Disease Control Rate (DCR): Patients who have measurable disease by [CONTACT_393] 
1.1 at randomization will be included in the analysis of DCR whi ch is defined as a composite of 
Stable Disease, Partial Response and Complete Response as classi fied according to the 
definitions set out below [Eisenhauer 2009]. For patients who di scontinue protocol therapy prior 
to their first objective assessment of response, it is imperati ve that an objective response 
assessment be undertaken as close to the protocol specified sch edule as possible.
10.1.6 Evaluable for Quality of Life Assessment: All patients who have completed the baseline quality of 
life questionnaire and at least one other QoL questionnaire are  evaluable.
10.2 RESPONSE AND EVALUATION ENDPOINTS
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised international criteria 
(1.1) proposed by [CONTACT_39694] (R esponse Evaluation Criteria in S olid Tumors) committee.

CONFIDENTIAL 43 CONFIDENTIAL10.2.1 Measurable Disease: Measurable tumor lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimen sion (longest di ameter to be reco rded) as > [ADDRESS_1054914] x-ray 
and as > [ADDRESS_1054915] an identifiable soft tissu e component that meets these 
requirements (soft tissue component > [ADDRESS_1054916] scan). Malignant lymph nodes must be > 
15mm in the short axis to be considered measurable; only the sh ort axis will be measured and 
followed. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeter s (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). Previously irradiated lesions are not considered measurable unless progression has 
been documented in the lesion. 
10.2.2 Non-measurable Disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesion s are 
considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions without a measu rable soft tissue component, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions,  lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of lung o r  s k i n  a n d  a b d o m i n a l  m a s s e s  
followed by [CONTACT_347068]-measurable. Lesion s in previously irradiated areas 
are non-measurable, unless progression has been demonstrated.
10.2.3 Target Lesions: When more than one measurable tumor lesion is present at baseli ne all lesions up 
to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ ) representative of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will  be recorded and measured at 
baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of the ir size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in add ition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . Note that pathological nodes must meet the 
criterion of a short axis of > [ADDRESS_1054917] scan and only the short axis of these nodes will 
contribute to the baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (t hose with short axis > 10 mm but <
15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have  a  s h o r t  a x i s  < 1 0  m m  a r e  
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or follo wed (see 10.2.4). At baseline, the 
sum of the target lesions (longest diameter of tumor lesions pl us short axis of lymph nodes: 
overall maximum of 5) is to be recorded. 
After baseline, a value should be provided on the CRF for all i dentified target lesions for each 
assessment, even if very small. If extremely small and faint le sions cannot be accurately 
measured but are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too 
small to measure and indeed are believed to be absent, a defaul t value of 0 mm may be used. 
10.2.4 Non-target Lesions: All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measu rable lesions 
over and above those listed as target lesions are considered  non-target lesions . Measurements are 
not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and s hould be followed as “present” or 
“absent”.
10.2.5 Response: All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE from the start of st udy treatment until 
the end of treatment classified as outlined below: 
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of target  and non-target . Pathological lymph nodes 
must have short axis measures < 10 mm (Note: continue to record  the measurement even if < 10 
mm and considered CR). Residual lesions (other than nodes < 10 mm) thought to be non-
malignant should be further investigated (by [CONTACT_768967] [Eisenhauer 2009] ) before CR can be accepted. 
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of me asures (longest diameter for

14.3 SAMPLE SIZE AND DURATION OF STUDY
The primary study endpoint is Overall Survival (OS).  The study  is designed to have a power of 
90% and a two-sided alpha of 5% to detect a 24% reduction in the  continuous risk of death (HR 
0.76, which corresponds to an increase of median survival from 7 .36 to 9.67 months) in the 
Intention to Treat (ITT) general study population.  It is estim ated that [ADDRESS_1054939] this reduction which would be observed by [CONTACT_4296]  700 patients over 24 months 
and following them for an additi onal 12 months (including up to  5% of yearly dropouts).   
Assuming that 40% of deaths occur in patients who are biomarker -positive, the study will have 
90% power to detect a 31% reduction in the risk of death (HR 0. 69) at two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1054940] continued study follow up throug h to their deaths.

study. The role and responsibility of the DSMB will be defined in a separate Charter.
The interim analysis will be performed on OS, the primary endpo int of this study, when at least 
2/3rdof the required number of events (380) have been observed. This  a n a l y s i s ,  b a s e d  o n  t h e

versus
H1: survival on BBI608+paclitaxel > survival on placebo + paclita xel 
The comparison of the overall population will be tested based o n a generalization of the Lan-
DeMets error spending function approach using an O’Brien-Flemin g stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_768918] 
H0, controlling for a two-sided alpha of 5% at the end of the stu dy. For example, if exactly 380 
deaths (67% of the required events) were in the locked database  for the interim analysis, the 
nominal critical point for rejecting H 0would be 2.502corresponding to a p-value of 0.012.  Thus 
H0would be rejected, and superiority of BBI608 declared, early if  the p-value from stratified log-
rank test is  0.012. 
This trial was activated on October 2, [ADDRESS_1054942]. Given th at no safety concerns were identified 
by [CONTACT_4318], in cases in which a patient appears to be deriving  benefit from BBI608 and is 
tolerating treatment well, open-label continuation of study tre atment was permitted with patient 
consent.  
Due to study unblinding the analysis plan is amended as follows:  analysis will be conducted for 
primary endpoint of OS as outlined in Section 13.3. Patients wil l continue to receive treatment, if 
felt to be potentially beneficial by [CONTACT_58401], until a discontinuation criterion is met or 
until September [ADDRESS_1054943]. Additionally, all secondary and exploratory 
analyses will be performed as outlined in the protocol.

CONFIDENTIAL 60 CONFIDENTIAL14.6 CORRELATIVE STUDIES
The correlative science component of the BBI608-336 trial will include tumor and blood based 
assays to identify biomarkers of benefit from BBI608 therapy, a s well as biomarkers of BBI608 
resistance. The purpose of these studies is to explore the rela tionship between biomarkers and 
disease response. The research aims to validate molecular marker s such as genes (DNA) and gene 
products (mRNA or proteins), with measurements of their sequenc e, post translation 
modifications or degree of expression, that can guide the use of appropriate therapeutic treatment 
regimens. The ultimate goal of identifying molecular markers is  to improve subject responses and 
other measures of clinical benefit by [CONTACT_768973]’s tumor diagnostic profile 
with an anticancer agent that has demonstrated a therapeutic ad vantage in subjects with a similar 
diagnostic profile.
Using data from this and other trials, the relationship between  a number of molecular markers 
associated with the STAT3 ȕ-catenin and other related pathways, and the clinical outcomes w ith 
BBI608 therapy will be explored. Multiple molecular markers in a paraffin-embedded tumor 
tissue sample can be determined by [CONTACT_768974]. 
In addition to analysis of potential biomarkers of benefit from  BBI608 therapy, an analysis of 
markers of resistance to BBI608 will be conducted using blood s amples drawn at baseline as well 
at [ADDRESS_1054944] initiation of therapy. This analysis may involv e SNPs, CYPS, and metabolomics. 
Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, or cores (two 2 mm cores of t umor from the block) and 10-
[ADDRESS_1054945] available archival tissue 
may enroll on the study with permission of the Sponsor/CRO. 
Blood samples will be collected prior to dosing with BBI608 and  then at week 4 while on
BBI608/Placebo. 
The following analysis will be performed to investigate the rel ationship between endpoints and 
biomarker levels (e.g. STAT3, phospho-STAT3, E-catenin, etc): 
For each biomarker, Cox Proportional Hazards model will be used  to model the relationship 
between Overall Survival, Progression-Free Survival and duratio n of response with baseline value 
of the biomarker. The model will also include assigned treatmen t, interaction between treatment 
and biomarker, and will be stratified by [CONTACT_768975].
For biomarkers with post-baseline measurements, similar analysi s will be done with change from 
baseline of a biomarker as a covariate, for both time points. A n additional model that includes 
prognostic factors may be investigated. 
The relationship between the endpoint and binary biomarkers (e. g. baseline phospho-STAT3 
status,E-catenin, etc) will be also examined using the log-rank test, s tratified by [CONTACT_768976]. Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_768977]. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to desc ribe overall survival, 
progression-free survival and duration of response by [CONTACT_768978] s of the biomarker (e.g. phospho-
STAT3-high vs. phospho-STAT3-lo w) and by [CONTACT_1570].

will be investigated using logistic regression that includes as signed treatment and biomarker 
value and treatment-by-biomarker interaction, stratified by [CONTACT_768979]. 
An additional model that includes prognostic factors may be inv estigated. The relationship 
between response and binary biomarkers (e.g. baseline phospho-S TAT3 status or STAT3 status) 
will also be examined using the CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_768980] n t  a n d  b a s e l i n e  E C O G

Exploratory analyses, in addition to those described in this sec tion, such as alternative modeling 
approaches and analyses of other biomarkers are expected and ma y be performed. All analyses 
described in this section are based on availability of data.

Quality of Life Analysis
The Quality of Life (QoL) of patients will be assessed using EO RTC QLQ-30 while the patient 
remains on BBI608/Placebo as per Section 9.1. The EORTC QLQ-30 i s  a  s e l f - a d m i n i s t e r e d  
cancer specific questionnaire with multi-dimensional scales. It  consists of both multi-item scales 
and single item measures, including five functional domains, a global quality of life domain, three 
symptom domains, and six single items. Scoring of the EORTC QLQ -30 data will be completed 
following the procedures recommended by [CONTACT_768982] o n Quality of Life. For each 
domain or single item measure a linear transformation will be a pplied to standardize the raw 
score to range between 0 and 100. The quality of life data will  be analyzed to look for statistically

at time 2 (~8 weeks) and time 4 (~16 weeks) for the physical fu nction and global health 
status/quality of life subscale scores. Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare the difference at 
each of these two time points between two treatment arms for eac h of these two subscales. The 
Hochberg method [Hochberg 1988] will be used to adjust for four comparisons in the primary 
analyses. The proportion of patients in either arm with at leas t a minimum of 10 unit(s) 
deterioration in change scores at both 8 and 16 weeks will be c ompared by [CONTACT_111709]’s

such as culture, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, col our, mental or physical disability 
(except incapacity), sexual orientation, sex/gender, occupation , ethnicity, income, or criminal 
record, unless there is a valid reason (i.e. safety) for the ex clusion.  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Tri-Coun cil Policy Statement (TCPS), 
vulnerable persons or groups will not be automatically excluded  from a clinical trial (except for 
incompetent persons) if participation in the trial may benefit the patient or a group to which the 
person belongs.  
However, extra protections may be necessary for vulnerable pers ons or groups. It is the 
responsibility of the local investigator and Institutional Revi e w  B o a r d  ( I R B )  t o  e n s u r e  t h a t  
appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect vulnerable perso ns/groups. In accordance with 
TCPS, researchers and IRB should provide special protections for  those who are vulnerable to 
abuse, exploitation or discrimination. As vulnerable population s may be susceptible to coercion 
or undue influence, it is especially important that informed co nsent be obtained appropriately.  
Centers are expected to ensure compliance with local IRB or inst itutional policy regarding 
participation of vulnerable persons/groups. It is the center’s responsibility to ensure compliance 
with all local SOPs. 
Persons who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompe tent persons, or those 
physically incapacitated such as comatose persons) are not to b e recruited to this study. It is the 
responsibility of the local investigator to determine the subje ct’s competency, in accordance with 
applicable local policies and in conjunction with the local IRB  (if applicable).  
Subjects who were competent at the time of enrollment in the cl inical trial but become 
incompetent during their participation do not automatically hav e to be removed from the study. 
When re-consent of the patient is required, investigators must follow applicable local policies 
when determining if it is acceptable for a substitute decision maker to be used. The Sponsor will 
accept re-consent from a substitute decision maker. If this pat ient subsequently regains capacity, 
the patient should be re-consented as a condition of continuing  participation.

CONFIDENTIAL 65 CONFIDENTIAL16.3 OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT
Informed consent will be obtained for each participant/potentia l participant in this trial, in 
accordance with ICH-GCP section 4.8. The center is responsible f or ensuring that all local 
policies are followed.
Additionally, in accordance with GCP 4.8.2, the Sponsor may requ ire that participants/potential 
participants be informed of any new information may impact a pa rticipant’s/potential 
participant’s willingness to participate in the study at which t ime participants remaining on study 
treatment will be re-consented.  
Based upon applicable guidelines and regulations (Declaration o f Helsinki, ICH-GCP), a 
participating investigator (as defined on the participants list ) is ultimately responsible, in terms of 
liability and compliance, for ensuring informed consent has bee n appropriately obtained. The 
Sponsor recognizes that in many centers other personnel (as des ignated on the participants list) 
also play an important role in this process. In accordance with  GCP 4.8.5, it is acceptable for the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_768943].
The Sponsor requires that each participant sign a consent form p rior to their enrolment in the 
study to document his/her willingness to take part. The Sponsor may also require, as indicated 
above, that participants/potential participants be informed of new information if it becomes 
available during the course of the study and participants remain ing on study treatment will be re-
consented. In conjunction with GCP 4.8.2, the communication of this information should be 
documented. 
The Sponsor allows the use of translators in obtaining informed consent. Provision of translators 
is the responsibility of the local center. Centers should follow  applicable local policies when 
procuring or using a translator for the purpose of obtaining in formed consent to participate in a 
clinical trial. 
In accordance with ICH-GCP 4.8.9, if a subject is unable to rea d, then informed consent may be 
obtained by [CONTACT_111719] s ubject. This process must be 
thoroughly documented. 
16.3.1 Obtaining Consent for Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting 
Information from and/or about the subject (i.e. the pregnant fe male, the newborn infant, male 
partner) should not be collected about or from them unless or u ntil they are a willing participant 
in the research. The rights and protections offered to particip ants in research apply and consent 
must be obtained prior to collect ing any information about or f rom them. If the pregnant female is 
not a participant in the main trial, consent should be obtained  via use of the exposure/ pregnancy 
follow-up consent form.  
In the case of information collected about a new born, consent should be provided by [CONTACT_111720]. In cases where the legal guardian is the participant in the main trial, consent is 
obtained via the main consent. If the legal guardian is not the trial participant, consent should be 
obtained via the exposure/pregnancy follow-up consent. 
Participants will not be withdrawn from the main trial as a res ult of refusing or withdrawing 
permission to provide information related to the pregnancy /exposure . Similarly, male participants

CONFIDENTIAL 78 CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX IV - QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT
Introduction 
The assumption that control of symptoms will automatically impr ove quality of life is probably true but 
hasn't yet been tested, especially in determining how certain s ymptoms may or may not affect quality of 
life. Current literature reveals interesting things; two in par ticular are:
xadditional and useful information may be obtained from quality of life measurements 
xa growing consensus that the goal of medical care today for mos t patients is the preservation of 
function and well-being in everyday life.
We have reached the stage where the collection of information a bout psychological distress, social 
disruption, emotional trauma and painful side-effects is not on ly necessary but a routine component in 
many protocols. 
Quality of life data can be used in a variety of ways:
xto try to achieve the best possible outcome for patients
xto evaluate the extent of change in the quality of life of an i ndividual or group across time
xto evaluate new treatments and technologies
xto support approval of new drug applications 
xto try to provide the best value for health care dollars 
xto compare costs and benefits of various financial and organiza tional aspects of health care services
In the future, approval of not only drugs but also new therapie s or methods of delivery will most likely be 
based on a combination of quality of life, survival, response, and adverse event data. 
Instructions for Administration of a Quality of Life Questionna ire. The instructions below are intended as 
a guide for the administration of the Quality of Life questionn aire. 
1. Preamble
Quality of life data are collected for research purposes, and w ill usually not be used for the patient’s 
individual medical care. The assessment is in the form of a sel f-report questionnaire. Therefore, it 
must be completed by [CONTACT_11581] t only, without translation, coa ching or suggestions as to the "correct" 
answer by [CONTACT_188084].
The usual scheduled times to obtain the questionnaires are as f ollows: 
xpre-randomization or pre-registration (baseline)
xduring treatment 
xduring follow-up 
The information provided by [CONTACT_768985] e consent form signed by [CONTACT_4677].

Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-14
  
CONFIDENTIAL 79 CONFIDENTIALIf a particular question has not been answered, please document  the reason(s) in the appropriate space 
on the questionnaire. If the whole questionnaire has not been c ompleted, please document the 
reason(s) on the appropriate case report forms.
2. Pretreatment Assessment
It should be explained to the patient that the purpose of the q uestionnaire is to assess the impact of 
treatment on different areas of the patient's life, e.g.: psych ological distress, social disruption, side-
effects, et cetera.
Study staff should collect the questionnaire as soon as it has b een completed, check to see that each 
question has been answered and gently remind the patient to ans wer any inadvertently omitted 
questions. If a patient states that s/he prefers not to answer some questions and gives a reason(s), the 
reason(s) should be noted on the questionnaire. If a specific r eason is not given, this also should be 
noted on the questionnaire. 
3. Assessments During Treatment
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patien t before being seen by [CONTACT_106224], and 
prior to treatment on the day of treatment, as required by [CONTACT_111728]. If the patient 
does not have a doctor visit scheduled, or if it was not possib le for the patient to complete the 
questionnaire before being seen by [CONTACT_106224], s/he should stil l complete the questionnaire prior to 
treatment.
4. Assessments During Follow-up 
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patien t before being seen by [CONTACT_106224], for as 
long as the patient continues on Protocol therapy, as required by [CONTACT_768986]: 
•4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weeks or until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 o r hospi[INVESTIGATOR_768948]
•the first regularly scheduled 4 week assessment at which the pa tient has been off study therapy 
for a minimum of 28 days (+/- 3 days) if study therapy discontinuation occurred prior to 24 
weeks and until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] f or end of life care  
A patient may, on occasion, be reluctant to complete the questi onnaire because they feel unwell. In 
that case, you may express sympathy that things are below par, but state that this is exactly the 
information we require if we are to understand more about how q uality of life is affected. You may 
also remind them that it takes only a few minutes to complete.
It defeats the whole purpose of the assessment if it is delayed  until the patient feels better!
5. What If . . .
The patient should complete the questionnaires at the clinic. T he exception is that the design of 
some trials may require the patient to take the questionnaire h ome with them after leaving the 
clinic, and complete it on the specific day, because a return v isit to the clinic is not scheduled.
There may be circumstances when the patient does not complete th e questionnaire as required in 
the clinic. Three situations are described below. In these case s, it is beneficial if quality of life 
data can still be collected.
BBI608-336
Amendment 8
Amendment Date: 2017-JUL-[ADDRESS_1054964] the patient by [CONTACT_768987]. 
Ask the patient if s/he is willing to complete one:
If yes, mail a blank questionnaire to the patient, and make arr angements for return of the 
questionnaire in a timely fashion. Record the date it was maile d and the date received on the 
questionnaire. 
If this is not feasible, then ask the patient if s/he is willing  to complete a questionnaire over 
the phone. If the patient agrees, read out the questions and ra nge of possibilities, and record 
the answers. Make a note on the questionnaire that the question naire was completed over the 
phone. 
If no, note the reason why the questionnaire was not completed o n the appropriate case report 
form.
B. The patient goes on an extended vacation for several months a nd won't attend the clinic for 
regular visit(s).
Ensure that the patient has a supply of questionnaires, with in structions about when to 
complete them, and how to return them. If it is known beforehan d, give the patient blank 
questionnaires at the last clinic visit; if the extended absenc e is not known in advance, mail 
the blank questionnaires to the patient. Written instructions m ay help ensure that the patient 
stays on schedule as much as possible. 
C. The patient does not want to complete the questionnaire in cl inic. 
Should the patient not wish to answer the questionnaire in the clinic but insists on taking it 
home, and failing to comply with the patient's wishes is likely  to result in the questionnaire 
not being completed at all, then the patient may take the quest ionnaire home with instructions 
that it is to be completed the same day. When the questionnaire  is returned, the date on which 
the questionnaire was completed should be noted and a comment m ade on the questionnaire 
as to why the patient took it away  from the clinic before compl etion.

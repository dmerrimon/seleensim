the child survives, but has  him or her recover with comfort  and preservation of the heart and other vital organs through 
reduce d complications .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_128389], these problems continue to occur.  Additionally, 
recent concerns about the crisis surrounding opi[INVESTIGATOR_15834]/abuse have  had an effect reducing the use of these drugs even in 
situations where they are i ndicated.   
 Moving beyond pharmacologic strategies is one way to consider reaching the goal of increased comfort and 
reduced complications.  Acupuncture has been used for centuries to diagnose and treat a variety of medical conditions 
and is the practice of using certain anatomical points to achieve well -being in the patient.  Conventional  acupuncture 
techniques involve needle manipulation at a specific anatomical point, but this approach may be difficult, if not 
impossible, to use in the operating room (O R) because of physical access and time constraints.    
Electro -acupuncture (EA) can achieve the results of standard acupuncture with less time and utilizes electric 
current instead of needle manipulation to achieve its effects .  The electric stimulation is  provided through an acupuncture 
needle or a small electrode  pad, and can be transmitted using different wave forms. These waveforms have th e following 
theorized advantage s1:  Continuous and/or a dense -disperse wave for analgesia, and d ense-disperse wave f or blood 
circulation.  
With electro -acupuncture, the stimulation frequency plays an important role in the release of naturally occurring 
analgesics.  Evidence suggests that lower frequencies ( 2 Hz)  result in the release  of enkephalins and endorphins, where as 
higher frequencies (100  Hz) result in the release of dynorphins.2  Varying between high and low frequencies (continuous 
plus dense -disperse) endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_128390].   
There is controversy  about the optimal current. Most studies  have used current in the milliampere range and 
adjusted the current  to be just below the threshold where electrically stimulated movement is observed, or typi[INVESTIGATOR_128391]-range (1 -14mA). In contrast, there is a beli ef that the optimal current utilized should be in the microampere range.  
The Arndt -Shultz Law postulates that weak currents increase physiologic activity while strong current inhibit it.  
Adherents believe that micro currents (50 micro amps  -1000  microamp (1 Milliamp)) increase ATP concentrations while 
currents above [ADDRESS_144800] found 
effective in dealing with issues encountered during cardiac surgery . The only recent pediatric cardiac acupuncture study 
was a randomized control trial done by [CONTACT_128406] X et al.4 Their study looked at 70 non -complex congenital heart patients age 2 -
12 that underwent cardiopul monary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) with an aortic cross clamp. They stimulated point pericardial 6 (PC 6) 
bilaterally for  [ADDRESS_144801] at a frequency of 2 Hz. The mean amplitude used was 14±3mA.  
Lower troponin and C -reactive proteins were observed i n children receiving stimulation. Shorter ventilation times, 
shorter PI[INVESTIGATOR_128392], higher levels of naturally occur ring pain killers (β -endorphin) and lower levels of stress hormones 
(serotonin levels (5 -HT)) were seen in the EA group . 
Other adult cardiovascular studies have found similar advantages of stimulation of the PC -[ADDRESS_144802] on ischemic 
re-perfused myocardium by [CONTACT_128407].5 The patients receiving EA at PC 6 had higher superoxide 
dismutase levels and lower troponin  levels than the control group.4 Yang  et al. stimulated PC 6 along with LieQue lung 
(LU) [ADDRESS_144803] been shown to decrease 
complications. Qiang et al. added PC 4 to PC 6.  They stimulated for 30 minutes one to two hours prior to the procedure. 
Compared to their control group that did not get EA, the EA treatment group (stimulated with 2 and15 Hz at 7 -11mA) 
had a decreased incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio 0.327, 95% CI 0.140 –0.767, P 
= 0.010) at [ADDRESS_144804]. The points stimulated for this stud y were ZhongFU (Lung 1), Lung 7 and 
PC 4.10 Points used by [CONTACT_128408]. included Lung 1, Chize (Lung 5) and PC 4.10.  Their acupuncture group needed 
significantly less blood transfusion, less antibiotics for pulmonary infections, and had shorter duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
shorter ICU stays and lower medical costs. They stimulated their points at [ADDRESS_144805] stage 1 acute kidney injury (AKI). It is speculated that this AKI  is related to activation of 
sympathoexcitatory inputs modulated through renal afferent nerves. Recent studies have tried to decrease this incidence 
by [CONTACT_128409] [ADDRESS_144806] at 2 and 15 Hz with 1 mA reduced morphologic renal damage and attenuated renal tubular 
apoptosis.13  
A special consideration during cardiac surgery is that organ blood flow is also often affected by [CONTACT_105] -pulsatile 
flow or hypotension. Lele et al., in a controlled hypotension model in dogs, found that EA helped maintain better blood 
flow to the stomach and kidney, resulting in reduced apoptosis in those organs. Further, the apoptosis that was observed 
in the control animals’ brains did not occur in the animals receiving EA. Points used were large intestine (LI) -4, ST -36 
spleen (SP) - 6 and LI -11 stimulated bilaterally at 2 Hz with 3 -5 mA.14  
Research Plan:  
This study will help to identify whether electroacustimulation is a beneficial anesthes ia adjunct  in children undergoing 
procedures on their congenital heart defects.  
 
Electroacustimulation is a technique with minimal risks, which enhances the body’s innate abilities to deal with the 
stresses and pain of surgery.  Our goal is to optimize care for those patients with congenital heart disease by [CONTACT_128410] .   This study will examine com fort using age appropriate pain scoring systems . The 
complications this study will focus on are myocardial  injury which will be assessed by [CONTACT_128411], and 
renal injury assessed using AKIN criteria  
   
Treatment Groups:  
Subjects will be rando mized. Randomization will be done using block randomization with block sizes between 4 and 8.  
The sham procedure will use the identical set up as the treatment group, but those participants in the sham group will not 
receive the electro -stimulation.   
 
Group 1: Will have electrodes placed  at Pericardial 4 and 6, Large Intestine 4, and Stomach 36  and receive  
electroacustimulation (treatment) frequency will be at 2Hz and 100 Hz the amplitude will be 1000mA.  
 
Group 2:  Will have electrodes placed  at Pericar dial 4 and 6, Large Intestine 4, and Stomach 36 and  receive sham 
electroacustimulation (control) will not have stimulation.  
 
 
Duration of Treatment:  
The duration of treatment  (stimulation  or sham)  for subjects will be length of  surgical procedures on thei r congenital 
heart defects .  Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_144807] data on 
pain, and renal  injury.   
 
Objectives:  
 
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to identify whether ele ctroacustimulation is a beneficial anesthesia adjunct  in 
children undergoing procedures on their congenital heart defects.  Does it decrease myocardial injury and or need for 
myocardial support. Differences between the groups Troponin I levels pre -operative  and six hours postoperative will be 
evaluated.    
 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1) Evaluate  the incidence  discomfort  in the post - operative period.  
 
To evaluate the incidence and severity of pain assessed by [CONTACT_128412]/Infant Pain Scale (NIPS ) ( children age birth to 2 months) FLACC  (2 
months to 7 years or unable to communicate , or VAS (age 8 -18) every [ADDRESS_144808] procedure.   
 
2) Determine the incidence of  Acute kidney injury (AKI) between  these two treatment groups.  Acute Kidney Injury will  
be evaluated by [CONTACT_128413]. Creatinine and urines will be measured at [ADDRESS_144809]-operative  myocardial support:  
 
To assess th e need for myocardial support an inotropic score will be used and compared between the two groups. The 
Inotropic score will be evaluated every 6 hours for 48 hour between the 2 groups  
. 
 
Study Design:  
 
This is a single site, randomized, blinded, sham contr olled, parallel group study to identify whether electroacustimulation 
is a beneficial anesthesia adjunct  in children undergoing procedures on their congenital heart defects.  
 
Study subjects age’s birth to eighteen years, undergoing cardiac surgery for thei r congenital heart lesions will be 
considered for entrance into the study . The randomized subjects will receive either electrostimulation  or sham during 
their surgery for CHD.  Subjects are expected to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [ADDRESS_144810] by[CONTACT_6476]/aortic clamp 
removal .  Urine samples will be obtained pre -surgically after placement of the Foley   and every [ADDRESS_144811] . 
 
Number of Subjects planned:  
Approximately 108 patients, over the two years, with randomi zation of 54 allocated to each group.  
● Electroacustimulation (treatment) frequency will be at 2Hz and 100 Hz the amplitude will be 1000mA.  
● Sham electroacustimulation (control) will not have stimulation  
 
Study Population:  
Inclusion criteria:   
Subjects mu st fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in the study:  
 
1) Patients 0 -18 years of age undergoing  procedures on their congenital heart defects.  
Additionally, patients with coar ctation of the aorta for repair will be c onsidered as a separate  group and eligible 
for enrollment.  
2) Willing to provide written Assent/Consent in English.  
 
Exclusion criteria :  
Subjects will be excluded if they fulfill any of the following exclusion criteria:  
1) Patients with skin lesion over mo re than 50% of acupuncture sites.   
2) Patients in renal failure.  
3) Patients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  
4) Unwilling to provide written Assent/Consent in English.  
 
Concomitant Treatment:  
  All subjects will receive a standard anesthetic of propofol, rem ifentanil and dexmedetomidine at doses needed to 
maintain a stable BIS number and lack of movement.  When possible neuromuscular blocking agents will not be used. A 
morphine  infusion will be used for postoperative pain control based on need.  Those allergi c to morphine  will receive a 
substitute opi[INVESTIGATOR_128393].  
 
 
Study Procedures:  
Screening:  
Review of consent form - Subjects that provide written assent/consent and meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will 
be included into the study. Su bjects may withdraw consent to participate at any time. Participation in the study is 
voluntary.  Adverse events will be recorded after informed assent/consent obtained.  
 
Surgery:  Treatment/Sham  
Eligible subjects will undergo blood sampling (3.5cc ) and urin e sample (0.5-2cc) will be obtained prior to 
stimulation/sham.   
 
All subjects will have electroacustimulation pads  applied at four points bilaterally:  pericardial 4 (PC 4), pericardial 6 (PC 
6), large intestine 4 (LI 4) and stomach 36 (ST 36).  No needles  will be used . (Appendix A; 1)  
 
Subjects will be randomized. Randomization will be done using block randomization with block sizes between 4 and 8.  
The sham procedure will use the identical set up as the treatment group, but those participants in the sham  group will not 
receive the electro -stimulation.  Stimulation/sham will begin as soon as possible after induction of anesthesia and 
obtaining baseline laboratory samples of urine and blood.  
 
Group 1: Receive electroacustimulation (treatment) frequency will  be at 2Hz and 100 Hz the amplitude will be 1000mA.  
 
Group 2: Receive sham electroacustimulation (control) will not have stimulation.  
Subjects will undergo procedures on their congenital heart defects.  
 
Blind:  
The anesthesia provider will be blinded as to whether the electroacustimulation device is actually turned on or not. The 
research coo rdinator will hold the blind. T he electroacustimulation machine will be placed in an opaque bag to secure the 
blind.  The current is below the threshold to stimulate the muscle so that no movement will be visible . It is also below the 
sensory threshold so that it will not produce any discomfort in the subjects.  
 
Stimulation/Sham will be continued until the patient is ready for transport to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890].  
 
Post-Operative:  PI[INVESTIGATOR_128394]/Sham will be discontinued.  
 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_128395].  
 
Subject  comfort will be assessed using age appropriate West Virginia University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128396] U niversal Pain Assessment Tool or the Neonatal/Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) will be recorded in the 
electronic medical record (EMR) every [ADDRESS_144812] surgery. Total amount of 7cc of blood will be 
obtained for this study.  WVUH lab will process samples.  
 
Research urine samples (.05 -2cc) wi ll be collected at  6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after by[CONTACT_6476]. The urine samples will be 
stored in a -80 degree freezer and analyzed by [CONTACT_128414], 
Neutrophil gelatinase – associated lipocalcin (NGAL), WNT4.  
 
AKIN criteria will be used to evaluate AKI every [ADDRESS_144813] x -ray and creatinine levels , (used for AKIN),  are standard of care 
measurements and the data will be collected for this research project . 
 
An Electrostimulation Documentation Guide has been developed for the staffing. (Appendix A 2) 
 
Tool/Instruments to be used in data collection:  
Tools and instrume nts for data collection: secured Excel data base; Neonatal/Infant Pain Scale (NIPS); AKIN stage; 
Inotropic Scores; RACHS categories (Appendix A3 -6).  
 
Variables:  
Detailed descriptions of the variables are given in Appendix B .  The information collected for  each patient will include 
the following variables.  Outcomes : Pain score; inotropic score; Narcotic use ; renal laboratory values: creatinine, 
neutrophil gelatinase -associated lipocalin (NGAL), WNT4, AKIN score; superoxide dismutase; indicator for pneumoni a; 
time-to-extubation (intubation time, extubation time); length of pediatric intensive care unit (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) stay (arrival time, 
discharge time).  Other variables : Age, sex, cardiac defect, cyanosis, RACHS score, cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_128415] 
(CPB) , cross  clamp time and  surgery start and end time, occurrence of nausea, vomiting event, urine output, number of 
lobes with atelectasis.  
 
Analytic methodology  
Randomization:  Eligible participants will be randomized to the acupuncture treatment or control group using a  randomly 
varying block randomization method to ensure equal distribution among treatment groups.[ADDRESS_144814] and provide this information only the study personnel who will be setting up the acupuncture 
device.  Each participant will be assigned a unique number that will follow the patient through the study.  The study 
number and participant’s name [CONTACT_128418] a secure electronic database; this information will be linked to the 
randomization assignment to create a crosswalk file.  It will be stored in a separate password -protected database.  At the 
end of the study, the cross -walk file will b e used to link the patient data and treatment allocation.  
 
Sample size:  
Predicated on the primary aim, the sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_128397] a two -sided two -sample t -test with unequal 
variance t -test with an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 80%.  A morphine equivalent dose of 0.71 mg /kg was used fo r 
the control group and 0.57 mg/ kg for the acupuncture group. This represents a conservative 20% change between the 
control and acupuncture group. The standard deviation of the control g roup was estimated t o be 0.3 mg /kg for the control 
group and 0.[ADDRESS_144815] had a potential enrollment and retention of approxim ately 74 
patients per year accounting for a 25% non -consent rate and a 2% drop -out rate. This project is well powered for 
statistical significance and feasibility for a 2 -year study.  
 
Data collection:  
The data will be retrieved from the EMR and imported or entered into a secured EXCEL database.   
 
Statistical analysis plan:  
For all aims, univariate statistics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, min, max and skew) will be used to describe 
the collected data.  Parametric approaches (e.g. t -test, Pearso n’s correlation, and chi -squared test) will be used when the 
data satisfy the required statistical assumptions; they will be used to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics 
between treatment and control.  If the distributional assumptions are untenable, then the Mann -Whitney test, Spearman 
correlation, and Fisher’s exact test will be used.  We will use the Box -Cox or the exponential transformation when the 
absolute value of skew is greater than 0.4. 
To address the overall difference between the  control and the acupuncture group, we will look at the score changes 
between baseline and [ADDRESS_144816] based on the difference in outcome will be used to 
compare the two treatment groups.  For the categorical outcomes, a logistic regression model (generalized linear model 
with binary or multinomial outcome) will be used to compare the two treatment groups’ at baseline and [ADDRESS_144817] the two time point s.  This approach will provide 
consistency of modeling methodology for the secondary analyses.  Adjusted models will be considered (e.g. glm 
regression with identity and/or logit links) to account for any data imbalances, potential confounders, etc.  Minim ally, a 
RACHS score adjustment will be assessed for its relevance.  
A secondary analysis will be used to describe the longitudinal (repeated measures) outcome trends.  A generalized 
linear mixed -effects regress ion model will be used for longitudinal data.   Both unadjusted and adjusted trends will be 
assessed. We will account for both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation variance -covariance structures.  The 
generalized linear model approach will permit trend characterizations for either continuous or catego rical outcomes under 
the same generalized linear model framework.  
All results, predicated on formal hypothesis testing methodology, will use an alpha -level of 0.[ADDRESS_144818] recent version of the R language for statistical 
computing and graphics.

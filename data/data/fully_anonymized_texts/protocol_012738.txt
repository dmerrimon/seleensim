Protocol  Title:  
An Interventional  Efficacy  And  Safety,  Phase 2, Randomized, Double -Blind, 3-Arm Study 
To Investigate  Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir  in Nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770365]  12 Years  Of 
Age With Symptomatic COVID -19 Who Are Immunocompromised 
Brief Title:  
A Study to Learn  About  the Study Medicine Called  Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir  in People  at Least 
12 Years of Age With COVID -19 Who Are Immunocompromised 
Regulatory Agency  Identification  Number(s):  
 
US IND Number:  [ADDRESS_1057221]/CTIS  Number:  2022- 001362- 35 
ClinicalTrials.gov  ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Pediatric Investigational  Plan  Number:  NA 
Protocol  Number:  C4671034  
Phase:  2 
 
 
Rationale:  
Patients with COVID -19 who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of progressing 
to severe illness due to prolonged infection, limited contribution by [CONTACT_770422], and  increased  potential  for viral  resistance.  Emergence of  variants  that 
are resistant to available treatment also puts the wider population at risk. Patients who are immunocompromised may benefit from extended treatment durations. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  (5, 10, and 15-day dosing 
durations) for the treatment of COVID -19 in nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770366]  
≥12 years  of age and weigh  ≥40 kg who  are immunocompromised (main  study population).  
In addition, this study will also evaluate the efficacy and safety of a second treatment course 
of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, or 15- days) in an additional population of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770367] a rebound in COVID- 19 within 
14 days following completion of an initial 5- day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(population with rebound).

Overall Design:  
This Phase 2, randomized, double -blind study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, and 15- day dosing durations) for the treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_1057223] 12 years and 
weigh ≥40 kg who are immunocompromised (main study population). In addition, this study 
will also evaluate the efficacy and safety of a second treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, or 15- days) in an additional population of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770367] a rebound in COVID- 19 within

 14 days following completion of an initial 5- day treatment  course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(population with rebound). 
Participants in the additional population with rebound will be recruited during the enrollment 
phase for the main study population. Enrollment of the population with rebound will stop after the main  study population is fully  enrolled  or after  [ADDRESS_1057224] been enrolled, whichever occurs sooner. 
Participants  will be screened  on the same day as randomization or 1 calendar  day before 
randomization. The total study duration is up to 24 weeks, including study intervention 
administration through Day 15 or Day 16, safety assessments through Day 44, efficacy assessments through Week 24, and long- term follow -up at Weeks 12 and 24. 
An independent E- DMC  will review  unblinded data to ensure the safety  of participants  on an 
ongoing basis throughout the duration of the study. 
Number of Participants:  
Up to approximately 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. The study will randomize approximately 150 participants in a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, 
resulting in approximately 50 participants in each treatment arm (main study population). Randomization of the main  study population will be stratified  by [CONTACT_770423] (yes/no). Enrollment of participants in the main  study population considered  immunocompromised 
based solely on receiving corticosteroids or TNF blockers will be capped at approximately 25%. 
In addition, the study will also randomize an additional population of up to  
50 nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770366] (in a 1:1:1 randomization ratio) who are 
immunocompromised with a rebound in COVID -19 within  14 days following  completion  of 
an initial 5 -day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (population with rebound). 
Randomization for the population with rebound will not be stratified by [CONTACT_770424]. Enrollment of participants considered immunocompromised based solely on receiving corticosteroids or TNF  blockers in the additional population with rebound will not be capped.  
Note:  "Enrolled" means  a participant's, or their legally  authorized  representative’s,  agreement 
to participate in a clinical study  following completion of the informed consent/assent process 
and screening. A participant will be considered enrolled if the informed consent/assent is not withdrawn prior to participating in any study activity after screening. Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled.

The efficacy  and safety  data will be analyzed  and summarized  separately  for the main  study 
population and the additional population with rebound. 
No formal  interim analysis  will be conducted for this study. 
Ethical  Considerations:  
Previous studies have demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
in adults at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID -19 illness, which included 
participants who were immunocompromised. The FDA has granted EUA for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and 
pediatric patients (12 years of age and older) with positive results of direct SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1057230] immune response if infected, they may benefit from an extended duration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.  The most  common adverse events  described  with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
treatment are allergic reactions, change in taste, diarrhea, headache, and vomiting. Taking into account the measures to minimize risk to study participants, the potential risks identified in association with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are justified by [CONTACT_770426]. Additional potential benefit to 
individual pregnant study participants treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may include 
reduction in risks associated with severe COVID -[ADDRESS_1057231] agree to use appropriate contraception methods.

 2. INTRODUCTION  
Nirmatrelvir,  a potent  and selective SARS -CoV -2 3CL  orally  administered  protease  inhibitor, 
is being investigated in participants with COVID -19 who are immunocompromised. 
2.1. Study Rationale  
Patients with COVID -19 who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of progressing 
to severe illness due to prolonged infection, limited contribution by [CONTACT_770427], and increased potential for viral resistance.1,2 A limited number of 
participants who were immunocompromised participated in Study C4671005 (EPIC -HR, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Such patients may benefit from extended treatment durations. The purpose 
of the study is to evaluate  the efficacy  and safety  of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  (5-day, 10-day, and 
15-day dosing durations) for the treatment of COVID -19 in nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], symptomatic 
participants ≥[ADDRESS_1057256] 40 kg who are immunocompromised 
(main study population). 
In addition, this study will also evaluate the efficacy and safety of a second treatment course 
of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, or 15- days) in an additional population of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770367] a rebound in COVID- 19 within 
14 days following completion of an initial 5--day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(population with rebound). 
2.2. Background  
COVID- 19, caused  by [CONTACT_7547] -CoV -[ADDRESS_1057257] been  approved 
or authorized for emergency  use by  [CONTACT_770428].5 
Duration and sufficiency of vaccine protection may be inadequate in patients who are 
immunocompromised.2,6 Even with the administration of a booster dose, 
immunocompromised patients may  be less likely  to develop strong immune protection from 
vaccines.  
Currently authorized/approved vaccines may not be as effective against potential outbreaks from new coronavirus variants.

paused  as Omicron  variants  of concern  (BA.1  and BA.2)  have  reduced  in vitro  susceptibility 
to these agents and these antibody regimens are not expected to provide clinical benefit.9 
An additional  preventive  treatment,  tixagevimab  co-packaged  with cilgavimab,  has received 
EUA for pre -exposure prophylaxis in patients with moderate to severe immune 
compromise.10 
In December 2021, the FDA granted EUA for a 5 day course of treatment for 2 separate oral 
antiviral agents, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir11 and molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654]12, for the treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_1057260] 
experienced  symptomatic  relapses  of SARS -CoV -2 infection  following completion  of a 
5-day course  of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.
14-[ADDRESS_1057261] a potential 
re-infection event. A retrospective review of 483 high- risk patients treated with 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reported 4 (0.8%) of patients experienced rebound of symptoms.  
Median  time to rebound was reported  as [ADDRESS_1057262] following the completion of a 5- day course of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may indicate these patients require additional therapy to achieve 
sustained viral clearance.  
Certain comorbidities and characteristics such as an immunocompromised status and older age increase an individual’s risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_21337] -19.
18,19 COVID -19 may pose 
a unique threat to patients who are immunocompromised because COVID -19 vaccines are 
less effective in preventing infection.2,6 In addition, immunocompromised patients may be at 
risk for prolonged infection. Prolonged viral shedding in immunocompromised patients with influenza infection is well -documented and is associated with an increased frequency of 
treatment -resistant virus variants.
20,21 Prolonged viral shedding in immunocompromised 
patients  with SARS -CoV -2 infection  has also been  observed and has been  associated  with the 
emergence of treatment -resistant and novel virus variants.22,23 
Given  the risk for prolonged viral infection  in patients  who are immunocompromised, this 
patient population may benefit from longer duration therapy.  
In this study of participants with symptomatic COVID -19 who are immunocompromised 
(including an additional  population of symptomatic  participants  with rebound in COVID -19), 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir will be administered for 5, 10, or 15 days.

 2.2.1. Clinical Overview  
The safety and efficacy of a 5 -day treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in adults was 
demonstrated in Study C4671005 (EPIC -HR, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]2), which enrolled 
nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770375], including participants who were immunocompromised, 
with laboratory- confirmed diagnosis of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1057263] 1 risk factor for 
progression to severe disease and with a COVID -19 symptom onset of ≤5 days. In the 
analysis of the primary endpoint from all participants enrolled in Study C4671005, an 89% reduction in COVID -19-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770376] 3 days of symptom onset was observed. 0.72% of participants who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119839] 28 following randomization (5 of 697 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770377]),  compared  to 6.45%  of participants  who 
received placebo and were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47163] (44 of 682 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] 9 subsequent deaths) (p<0.001). In a secondary endpoint, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reduced the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770378] 88% compared with placebo in participants treated within 5 days of symptom onset; 0.77% of patients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769122] 28 following randomization (8 of 1039 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770377]) 
compared with 6.31% of patients who received placebo (66 of 1046 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] 
12 subsequent  deaths)  (p<0.001). Treatment  with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  was safe and well 
tolerated.
24 
On 22 December  2021, the US FDA  granted  EUA  to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  for the treatment 
of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age or older 
weighing ≥40 kg) who are at risk for progression to severe disease.11

Potential  Risk  of Clinical Significance  Summary  of Data/Rationale  for Risk Mitigation  Strategy  
Study  Intervention(s): Nirmatrelvir  
Emesis  In Study C4671005, vomiting occurred at a greater 
frequency in the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  group  than in 
the placebo group.  AEs will be monitored,  and participants  may 
receive antiemetics if needed.  
Hypertension  Transient  increases  in systolic,  diastolic,  and mean 
blood pressure were observed in the preclinical 
studies.  In Study C4671005 (adults  at high risk for 
severe disease),  a small  imbalance  in hypertension 
AEs (1% vs <1%) was reported.  Vital  signs  and all AEs will be monitored  in the 
study.  
Refer  to Section  8.4. 
Reduced  maternal  and fetal weight  In rabbit  embryo -fetal development  toxicity  studies, 
nirmatrelvir -related lower maternal body weight 
change and food consumption were observed at 
1000 mg/kg/day but were not considered adverse 
based on low magnitude of difference from control and lack of impact on absolute body weights.  
Nirmatrelvir  -related,  adverse,  lower  fetal weight 
(0.91x control)  was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day.  Lower  dose of 300 mg q12h  is used in this study.  
Study  Intervention(s): Ritonavir  
Gastrointestinal disturbances (including diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting  and abdominal  pain)  Frequently reported  adverse reaction  in HIV- positive 
patients who are HIV -positive at 600 mg BID.  Lower dose of 100 mg twice daily is used in this 
study. There will be close observation of AEs. In addition  to ongoing review  of AEs by [CONTACT_456], 
an E-DMC will review safety data as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Taking study  intervention  with food may improve 
tolerability.  
Neurological  disturbances  (eg, paresthesia, 
including oral paresthesia, dysgeusia and 
dizziness)  Frequently reported  adverse  reaction  in patients  who 
are HIV -positive at 600 mg BID.  Lower  dose used in this study.  There  will be close 
observation of AEs.

 2.3.2. Benefit  Assessment  
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has been shown to have SARS -CoV -2 antiviral activity in vitro. 
Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was demonstrated in adults at 
increased risk of progressing to severe COVID -19 illness, which includes participants who 
are immunocompromised. The EMA has granted conditional approval for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  for the treatment  COVID- 19 in adults  who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID -19.
26 The FDA has 
granted EUA for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir11 for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 in 
adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing ≥40 kg) with positive 
results of direct SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1057264]  immune  response  if infected,  potential 
benefits from an extended duration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir therapy may include a shorter 
time to reduction in viral RNA levels, clinical recovery, prevention of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and a 
lower probability of progressing to more severe illness or death.  
2.3.3. Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Considering the current COVID -19 global pandemic, the high burden of both mortality and 
morbidity, the potential  for future  epi[INVESTIGATOR_770379], the lack of readily  available outpatient 
treatment  options, and the measures  taken  to minimize  risk to study participants,  the potential 
risks identified in association with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are justified by [CONTACT_770430].

4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1. Overall  Design  
This Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, and 15- day dosing durations) for the treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_1057266] 12 years and 
weigh ≥40 kg who are immunocompromised (main study population). In addition, this study 
will also evaluate the efficacy and safety of a second treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, or 15- days) in an additional population of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770367] a rebound in COVID- 19 within 
14 days following completion of an initial 5- day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(population with rebound). 
Participants in the additional population with rebound will be recruited during the enrollment 
phase for the main study population. Enrollment of the population with rebound will stop after the main  study population is fully  enrolled  or after  [ADDRESS_1057267] been enrolled, whichever occurs sooner.  
Eligible  participants  (main  study population and additional  population with rebound)  for this 
study will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive:  
• nirmatrelvir  plus ritonavir  orally  q12h for 5 days followed by [CONTACT_770431] q12h for 10 days; or  
• nirmatrelvir  plus ritonavir  orally  q12h  for 10 days followed by [CONTACT_770431] q12h for 5 days; or  
• nirmatrelvir  plus ritonavir  orally  q12h for 15 days.

Page  44  
 Participants will be screened on the same day as randomization or 1 calendar day before 
randomization. For the main study population, enrollment of participants considered immunocompromised based solely on receiving corticosteroids or TNF blockers will be capped  at approximately 25%. Enrollment  of participants  considered immunocompromised 
based  solely  on receiving  corticosteroids  or TNF  blockers  in the additional  population with 
rebound will not be capped. 
For the main  study population, randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_770432] (yes/no)  
(Section 10.9.4, Point #4). Randomization for the population with rebound will not be 
stratified  by [CONTACT_770433].  
The total study duration is up to [ADDRESS_1057268] completed the Week 24 visit. In addition, both analyses (primary and follow -up) will include separate results for the main study 
population and the additional population with rebound. 
An independent  E-DMC  will review  unblinded data to ensure  the safety  of participants  on an 
ongoing basis throughout the duration of the study ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
Patients with COVID -19 who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of progressing 
to severe illness due to prolonged infection, limited contribution by [CONTACT_770434], and increased potential for viral resistance.
1,2 Emergence of variants 
that are resistant to available treatment also puts the wider population at risk. Patients who are immunocompromised may benefit  from  extended  treatment  durations. The purpose  of the 
study is to evaluate the  efficacy  and safety  of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  (5, 10, and  15-day dosing 
durations) for the treatment of COVID -19 in nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770366]  
≥12 years  of age and  weigh  ≥40 kg who  are immunocompromised (main  study population).  
In addition, this study will also evaluate the efficacy and safety of a second treatment course 
of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (5 -, 10-, or 15- days) in an additional population of nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770367] a rebound in COVID- 19 within 
14 days following completion of an initial 5- day treatment course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(population with rebound).

 4.2.1. Diversity of Study Population  
This is a global study and the US diversity strategy will include sites with the potential to 
support the recruitment of diverse populations. In the US, medical institutions with varying characteristics,  such as urban and suburban institutions,  will be included. The strategy  to help 
ensure diversity includes:  
• Providing investigators  with recruitment materials  for both potential  participants  and 
other HCPs;  
• Creating  individual  site recruitment  plans  in collaboration with sites and providing 
supplemental diverse recruitment tools;  
• Developi[INVESTIGATOR_770381];  
• Translating  all patient -facing  materials  into US Spanish;  
• Educating site staff on the importance of including diverse  participants;  
• Monitoring diverse enrollment, in real time;  
• Implementing  additional  strategies  to mitigate  trending below  goals.  
4.2.2. Choice of Contraception/Barrier Requirements  
Human  reproductive  safety  data are limited  for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir,  but there is no 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_770382]. Therefore,  the use of a highly effective method of contraception is required  for 
female participants who are not pregnant at entry (see Appendix 4).  
4.2.3. Collection  of Retained  Research  Samples  
Retained  Research  Samples  will be collected  and stored  for further analyses  which  may,  for 
example, provide greater understanding of the study intervention. 
4.2.4. Inclusion  of Pediatric Participants  
Individuals of all ages are susceptible to SARS -CoV -2 infection. While younger patients 
appear to be less affected than the adult population and typi[INVESTIGATOR_770383], children are at risk for MIS -C. Certain subsets of the pediatric population may 
present with severe disease, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770384]. Risk factors for severe disease include neonatal age group and pre -existing medical conditions including 
children who are immunocompromised. There is an urgent need for safe and effective therapeutic interventions for individuals of all age groups that can reduce viral transmission, improve time to clinical recovery and prevent the progression of infection to more severe disease,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  and death  in the current  COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_901],  as well as for potential 
future coronavirus epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509].

 This study includes participants of 12 years of age and older and weighing ≥[ADDRESS_1057269] Sheet  for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  where  FDA has granted EUA for the 
treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age 
and older and weighing ≥40 kg).11 
4.3. Justification for Dose  
On 22 December 2021, the US FDA granted EUA to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for the treatment 
of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and pediatric patients ([ADDRESS_1057270] 40 kg) who are at risk for progression to severe disease, including patients 
who are immunocompromised. The recommended dose is 300 mg nirmatrelvir co-  
administered with 100 mg ritonavir q12h for 5 days. This dose was well tolerated in EPIC - 
HR and reduced the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377304] 89% compared with placebo in 
symptomatic  adult  participants  with COVID -19 who were at increased  risk of progression to 
severe disease.  
Based  on pharmacokinetic  modelling  and simulation,  the authorized  dosing  regimen  is 
expected to result in comparable plasma exposures of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in 
participants 12 years of age and older and weighing ≥40 kg as observed in adults.  
In this study, in addition to the authorized 5- day treatment regimen of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(300/100 mg q12h), 10- day and 15- day treatment durations will be studied. Patients who are 
immunocompromised may have higher viral RNA levels and prolonged viral shedding, 
which has been associated with more severe COVID -19 and the development of resistant 
viral variants. Consequently, these patients may benefit from longer anti -viral treatment 
durations to prevent an increase in viral RNA levels once treatment is completed. A 
quantitative systems pharmacology model of SARS -CoV -2 infection has been developed to 
describe SARS -CoV -2 viral RNA dynamics and was used to simulate the effects  of different 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment durations in immunocompromised patients.[ADDRESS_1057271] that a nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dosing duration of [ADDRESS_1057272] dose and exposure evaluated (500 mg of nirmatrelvir plus 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 10 days).
28 The safety and effectiveness of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have not been established in pediatrics.  
Results from the renal impairment study  showed that the adjusted geometric mean (90% CI) 
test/reference ratios comparing moderate renal impairment (test) to normal renal function 
(reference) for nirmatrelvir AUC inf and C max was 187.40% (148.52%, 236.46) and 138.12% 
(113.18%, 168.55%), respectively.29 Due to the increase in exposures  of nirmatrelvir  in those 
with moderate renal impairment, and verified by [CONTACT_493754], the 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose in patients with moderate renal impairment was reduced to  
150 mg/100 mg.

 Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be shipped by [CONTACT_770438]/ritonavir. [COMPANY_007] does not permit the shipment of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir by  [CONTACT_2319]. 
The tracking record of shipments, including temperature monitoring data, and the chain of custody of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  must  be kept in the participant’s  source  documents/medical 
records.  
6.1.1. Administration  
The first dose of study intervention will be administered  at the site. 
Nirmatrelvir [ADDRESS_1057280] of nirmatrelvir 150 mg or placebo for nirmatrelvir tablets and 1 bottle of ritonavir capsules or placebo for ritonavir at the subsequent Day 5 and Day 10 visits. Participants will be instructed to take:  
• 2 tablets  of nirmatrelvir  150 mg or  placebo for  nirmatrelvir q12h;  
• 1 capsule of ritonavir 100 mg or placebo for ritonavir q12h.  
o Participants with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 
m
2 or eCrCl ≥30 to <60 mL/min at screening) will receive either 1 tablet of 
nirmatrelvir 150 mg and placebo for nirmatrelvir or 2 tablets of placebo for nirmatrelvir ( Section 6.6). The dose for ritonavir remains unchanged (ie, 
participants  will receive 1 capsule of ritonavir  100 mg or placebo  for ritonavir 
q12h).  
Participants should take the first dose of study intervention on Day 1, during the in- person 
visit; that is, participants should take 2 tablets of nirmatrelvir 150 mg and 1 capsule of 
ritonavir  100 mg at the same time and no more  than 15 minutes  apart.  The study intervention 
should be taken  every  12 hours  (±4 hours), but no more  than twice  in a calendar  day. Timing 
of the second dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be adjusted slightly to allow participants to select a convenient [ADDRESS_1057281] dose.  Once  the dosing schedule  is adjusted, 
subsequent doses should be taken every 12 hours (±4 hours). 
If a dose is delayed, it should be taken as soon as possible, but no later than 4 hours before 
the next scheduled dose, and then resume the normal dosing schedule. If the participant misses a dose by [CONTACT_726] 8 hours, the participant should not take the missed dose and instead  take the next dose at the regularly  scheduled time.  The participant  should not double 
the dose  to make up for a  missed  dose. Dosing  should be  stopped at the end of the treatment 
period (30 doses total). Any remaining tablets and/or capsules at the Day 5, Day 10, and Day 15 visits should be returned.

 Participants  will swallow  the study intervention whole  and will not  manipulate  or chew  the 
study intervention prior  to swallowing. Participants  may take the study intervention with or 
without food. Taking study intervention with food may improve tolerability. Refer to the 
IPM for additional dosing and administration instructions. 
6.2. Preparation,  Handling,  Storage, and Accountability  
The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_770385]/ritonavir  capsules  are safe for administration  to 
pediatric participants.  
Study intervention will be self-administered  by [CONTACT_770439]/caregiver.  
1. The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate conditions (eg, 
temperature)  have been  maintained  during transit for all study interventions  received 
and any discrepancies  are reported  and resolved  before  use of the study intervention.  
2. Only  participants  enrolled  in the study may receive study intervention and only 
authorized site staff may  supply, prepare, and/or administer study intervention. 
3. All study interventions must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. At a minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations 
must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking days must indicate  the minimum and maximum temperatures  since previously documented upon 
return to business.  
4. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported  to [COMPANY_007]  upon discovery along with actions  taken.  The site should actively 
pursue options for returning the study intervention to labeled storage conditions, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the study intervention. Specific details regarding the excursion definition and information to report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IPM.  
5. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by [CONTACT_770440].  Site staff will instruct participants  on the proper  storage 
requirements for take -home study intervention. 
6. Study interventions should be stored in their original  containers.  
7. The investigator, institution,  head  of the medical  institution  (where  applicable),  or 
authorized site staff is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records), such as the IPAL or sponsor -approved equivalent. All study 
interventions will be accounted for using a study intervention accountability

 form/record.  All nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  that is taken  home  by [CONTACT_2299],  both used 
and unused, must be returned to the investigator by [CONTACT_2299]. Returned study 
intervention must not be redispensed to the participants.  
8. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the IPM. All destruction must be adequately documented. If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental  regulations, institutional policy, and any special  instructions 
provided by [CONTACT_4618].  
Upon identification  of a product  complaint,  notify the sponsor  within  1 business  day of 
discovery as described in the IPM.  
6.2.1. Preparation  and Dispensing  
A qualified staff member will dispense the nirmatrelvir/ritonavir using unique container 
numbers  via an IRT system  in the bottles  and blister  cards  provided, in quantities  appropriate 
according to the SoA . A second staff member will verify the dispensing. The 
participant/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the bottle and blister 
cards, as provided throughout the course of dosing and return the bottle and blister cards, as appropriate to the site at the next study visit. 
The study intervention will be administered in a blinded fashion to the participants.  
6.3. Assignment  to Study  Intervention  
Allocation  of participants  to treatment groups  will proceed  through the use of  an IRT system. 
The site personnel  (study coordinator  or specified  designee)  will be required to enter  or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s ID and password, the protocol number, 
and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a randomization number  corresponding to  the assigned  treatment  group, and  DU or  container  number(s) when 
study intervention is being supplied via the IRT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the participant number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files.  
For the main study population, randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_770441] (yes/no). Enrollment  of participants  who are considered  immunocompromised solely  based 
on corticosteroids or TNF blocker use will be capped at approximately 25% for the main study population.  
Randomization for the population with rebound will not be stratified by [CONTACT_770424]. Enrollment of participants considered immunocompromised based solely on receiving corticosteroids  or TNF  blockers  in the additional  population with rebound will not be capped.  
Study intervention will be  dispensed at  the study visits summarized  in the  SoA .

further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.4. Blinding  
This is a double -blind study.  
6.4.1. Blinding  of Participants  
Participants  and their caregivers  will be  blinded to their assigned  study intervention.  
6.4.2. Blinding of Site Personnel  
Investigators and other site staff will be blinded to participants’ assigned study intervention.  
 
Participants  will be  assigned  to receive study intervention according  to the assigned  treatment 
group from  the randomization scheme.  Investigators  will remain  blinded to each participant’s 
assigned study intervention throughout the course of the study. In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded 
study intervention records  at the site(s)  to verify  that randomization/dispensing has been  done 
accurately.  
6.4.3. Blinding of the Sponsor  
Sponsor staff will be blinded to participants’ assigned study intervention.  
Sponsor staff who are not directly involved with the conduct of this study will prepare analyses  and documentation containing unblinded data while  the study is ongoing to support 
interactions with the E -DMC.  
The study will be unblinded after all participants complete the Day 44 visit (or ET prior to Day 44 visit)  and analyses  through Day 44, including the primary  efficacy  endpoint  analyses, 
will be conducted.  
Details  of the unblinded  sponsor  staff supporting the E-DMC  and the timing  of unblinding 
will be outlined in the Unblinding Plan.  
6.4.4. Breaking  the Blind  
The IRT will be programmed with blind- breaking instructions. In case of an emergency,  the 
investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such  a determination. If  the investigator  decides  that unblinding is  warranted,  the 
investigator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_185604] a participant’s  treatment  assignment  unless  this could delay  further management

 of the participant.  If a participant’s  treatment  assignment  is unblinded, the sponsor  must  be 
notified within [ADDRESS_1057283] dose. Site personnel  will review  the participant -completed  electronic dosing diary  daily  during the 
study intervention period, preferably after the participant has self -administered the morning 
dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.  If any noncompliance  with dosing is suspected,  site personnel 
will promptly contact [CONTACT_40744], to remind them of the relevant study 
procedures and/or entering the information in the electronic diary as applicable. 
When  participants  are dosed  at the site, they will receive  study intervention  directly  from  the 
investigator  or designee,  under  medical  supervision. The date and time of each dose of study 
intervention administered in the clinic will be recorded by [CONTACT_770442]. The 
dose of study intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study intervention.  
When participants self -administer study intervention(s) at home, compliance with study 
intervention will be assessed  at each visit.  Compliance  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_770443]/capsules  and 
direct questioning, if applicable during the site visits and documented in the source documents.  
A record of the number of nirmatrelvir tablets/ritonavir capsules dispensed to and taken by [CONTACT_770444].  
The following noncompliance  cases  will be considered  medication  errors  (see 
Section 8.4.10).  
• Participants interrupting study intervention for 2 consecutive doses;  
• Participants  taking either  nirmatrelvir  or ritonavir  alone  for 2 consecutive  doses;  
• Participants who have an overall study intervention compliance <80% or >115%.  
In addition to the above listed- medication errors, any deviation from protocol -specified 
dosing (eg, missed  single  dose or partial  dose)  should be recorded  as a protocol  deviation and

 the investigator  or designee  is to counsel  the participant/guardian and ensure  steps  are taken 
to improve compliance.  
6.6. Dose Modification  
The dose may need  to be modified  on Day 5 or Day 10, based  on the eGFR  or eCrCl  result 
from the point -of-care device:  
• Participants  with a  Day  5 or Day  10 eGFR  <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or eCrCl  
<60 mL/min will receive a wallet consisting of 1 tablet of nirmatrelvir 150 mg and 
placebo  for nirmatrelvir  or 2 tablets  of placebo  for nirmatrelvir.  The dose of ritonavir 
remains unchanged.  
• Participants  with a Day  5 or Day  10 eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or eCrCl  
>60 mL/min,  will receive  a wallet  consisting of [ADDRESS_1057284]- of-care treatments,  as 
advised by [CONTACT_219875].  
6.8. Treatment  of Overdose  
Study sites should warn parents/caregivers to store the study intervention out of reach of children  and to provide  close supervision when  intervention will be self-administered  by [CONTACT_197503].  
For this study, any dose of nirmatrelvir/placebo  greater  than 900 mg (or any dose greater  than 
450 mg for participants on the reduced nirmatrelvir/placebo regimen) or ritonavir/placebo 
greater than 300 mg within a 24- hour time period will be considered an overdose.  
There is  no specific treatment for an overdose.  
In the event  of an overdose, the investigator  should:  
1. Contact [CONTACT_185605] 24 hours. 
2. Closely  monitor  the participant  for any AEs/SAEs  and laboratory abnormalities  as 
medically appropriate and at least until the next scheduled follow -up. 
3. Document  the quantity  of the excess  dose as well as the duration of the overdose  in 
the CRF.  
4. Overdose is reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  only when associated with an SAE.

case- by-case basis).  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by [CONTACT_770445].  
6.9. Prior and  Concomitant Therapy  
Hormonal  contraceptives  that meet  the requirements  of this study are allowed  to be used in 
participants who are WOCBP (see Appendix 4).  
Prior Therapy  
Use of an antiviral or monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_1057286]  completed  a recent (ie,  within  14 days)  initial 5-day course  of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (see Section 10.9.5).  
Permitted  During  the Study  
Participants  may receive concomitant  medications,  including SoC therapy  for COVID -19, in 
addition to study intervention, unless listed as prohibited medication (see Appendix 8) or as 
defined in Section 5.2. However, use of antiviral therapy, including monoclonal antibody therapy, is prohibited through the entire treatment period, except for participants who progress to severe or critical COVID -19.
30 
 
SoC therapy is defined as any therapy that is approved and used as indicated by [CONTACT_595334]  (including approvals  for emergency  use, compassionate  use, or through 
similar regulatory guidance), or any therapy as recommended by a relevant national (or a reputable international) scientific body (eg, WHO, ECDC, CDC, NIH).  
 
Sites  should consult  with  the sponsor  if a new  SoC  option becomes  available  after  study 
initiation.  Investigator  should ensure  that any recommended  SoC therapy  is not a strong 
inducer of CYP3A4 or highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance.  
Ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Participants will receive ritonavir for at least 5 days and up to 15 days but as treatment is blinded, some concomitant medications ( Appendix 8, 
Table 5) may require  monitoring of drug levels,  consideration of temporary  withdrawal  of the 
concomitant medication, or dose adjustment throughout the study treatment period and 
following completion of the blinded treatment duration period.

 Prohibited During the Study  
Use of a non-study antiviral or monoclonal  antibody therapy  for the treatment  of COVID -19 
within 15 days after randomization is prohibited, except for participants who progress to 
severe or critical COVID -19.30 
Nirmatrelvir  and ritonavir  are both primarily  metabolized  by [CONTACT_9058]  P450 (CYP) 3A4. 
In addition, ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, concomitant use of 
medications that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 and which are contraindicated in 
combination with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (see Appendix 8) are prohibited during study 
treatment.  
Additionally, coadministration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir with other medications that are not contraindicated but are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for clearance may require dose 
adjustment or additional monitoring. Investigators should reference Appendix [ADDRESS_1057287] of these medications  and consult  the [COMPANY_007]  medical  monitor  for guidance 
on coadministration with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.  
Medications or substances that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 and that are contraindicated 
in combination with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir must be discontinued for an appropriate washout 
period prior to the first dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and are prohibited for the duration of 
the study treatment period and for [ADDRESS_1057288] dose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
(Appendix 8). The appropriate washout period for CYP3A4 inducers should be determined 
based  on the prescribing information for the concomitant  medication  and in consultation with 
the medical monitor.  
7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation  of Study  Intervention  
It may be necessary  for a participant  to permanently  discontinue  study intervention. Reasons 
for permanent discontinuation of study intervention include the following:  
• AE of Grade  3 severity  or greater  and considered  by [CONTACT_770446];  
• SAE  considered  by [CONTACT_770447];  
• Requirement for prohibited concomitant medication;  
• Participants  who become  pregnant  during the  course  of the study;  
• Study terminated by  [CONTACT_3211];  
• Withdrawal by  [CONTACT_770448]/ritonavir 
Protocol C4671034  
Final  Protocol  Amendment  01, 13 September  2022  
PFIZER  CONFIDENTIAL

Page  61  
 • If post-screening  eGFR  <30 mL/min/1.73  m2 or eCrCl  is <30 mL/min  the participant 
will be instructed to discontinue any remaining study intervention doses as soon as 
study staff become aware of the eGFR results.  
In the event  that a participant  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], study intervention may continue  to be 
administered, as feasible, and based on medical judgment of the investigator. 
Note  that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent  withdrawal  from  the study. 
If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant should remain in the study 
to be evaluated for all subsequent scheduled assessments. See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow -up for any further 
evaluations that need to be completed.  
In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the appropriate CRF/in the medical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt  of study intervention or also from  study procedures, posttreatment study follow -up, 
and/or future collection of additional information. 
7.2. Participant  Discontinuation/Withdrawal  From  the Study  
A participant  may withdraw  from  the study at any time at their own request.  Reasons  for 
discontinuation from the study include the following:  
• Refused  further study procedures;  
• Lost to follow -up; 
• Study terminated by  [CONTACT_3211];  
• Withdrawal  of consent/assent  by [CONTACT_7078]/legal  guardian or by a child  who has provided 
assent during any phase of the study. 
At the time of discontinuing from the study (if before Day 44), if possible, an early 
discontinuation visit should be conducted. See the SoA for assessments to be collected  at the 
time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be 
completed.  
The early  discontinuation visit applies  only to participants  who  are enrolled/randomized and 
then are prematurely  withdrawn  from  the study. Participants  should be questioned regarding 
their reason for withdrawal. 
If a participant  withdraws  from  the study at any time,  they may request  destruction of any 
remaining samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document any such 
requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly. 
If the participant withdraws from the study at any time and also withdraws consent (see 
Section  7.2.1)  for disclosure  of future information, no further evaluations  will be performed

Page  [ADDRESS_1057289] continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The only 
exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent/assent for any further 
contact [CONTACT_219879]. Participants  should notify the investigator  in writing  of the decision  to withdraw 
consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be 
explained  in detail in  the medical records  by [CONTACT_11168], as to whether the withdrawal is 
only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that 
vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law.  
7.3. Lost  to Follow -Up 
A participant  will be considered  lost to follow -up if the participant  repeatedly  fails to return 
for scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. 
The following actions  must  be taken  if a participant  fails to be available for a required  study 
visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315]. Counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned  visit schedule,  and ascertain  whether  the participant  wishes  to and/or  should 
continue in the study;  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make every  effort  to regain  contact  [CONTACT_6635]  (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address  or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_219880]’s medical record; 
• Should the participant  continue  to be unreachable,  the participant  will be considered 
to have withdrawn from the study. 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
8.1. Administrative  and Baseline  Procedures  
The investigator  (or an appropriate  delegate at  the investigator  site) must  obtain  a signed and 
dated ICD before performing any study- specific procedures.  
Study procedures  and their timing  are summarized  in the SoA. Protocol  waivers  or 
exemptions are not allowed.

Page  [ADDRESS_1057290]  information  will be provided to the investigator  site prior 
to initiation of the study.  
The total blood sampling volume for individual adult participants in this study is 
approximately 260 mL. The total blood sampling  volume  for individual  pediatric  participants 
is approximately 195 mL. The actual collection times of blood sampling may change.  
Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by [CONTACT_4618], provided the total volume  taken  during the study does not exceed  550 mL during any period 
of 56 consecutive days. For pediatric participants, every effort will be made to ensure that blood volume  collections  do not exceed  1% of the total blood volume  at any single  time and 
3% of the total blood volume during any period of 4 weeks.  
8.1.1. Baseline  Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical  History  
Medical  history in addition to COVID- 19 disease  history and demographics  will be collected 
at screening. Smoking status will be collected. Complete medication history of all prescription or nonprescription drugs (including vaccinations), and dietary and herbal supplements taken within [ADDRESS_1057291] dose will also be collected.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary  Contacts  
On Day  [ADDRESS_1057292] 2 individuals who can be contact[CONTACT_770449]  (repeat/update as needed).  Secondary  contacts  may be used to determine  if 
a participant is lost to follow -up or for a vital status check.  
8.1.2. Home  Health  Visits  
A home  health  visit may be utilized  to facilitate  scheduled visits.  Home  health  visits  include 
a healthcare provider  conducting an  in-person study visit at the participant’s  location, rather 
than an in- person study visit at the site. The following may be performed during a home 
health visit (see the SoA ): 
• Review  and record  study intervention(s), including  compliance and  missed  doses.  
• Review  and record  any AEs and SAEs  since the  last contact.  Refer  to Section  8.4. 
• Review  and record  any new concomitant  medications  or changes  in concomitant 
medications since the last contact.  
• Review  and record  contraceptive method and results  of pregnancy  testing.  Confirm 
that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer to Appendix 4. 
• Collect clinical laboratory, PK, and biomarker samples.  
• Collect  NP swab  samples.  
• Collect  vital signs. 
• Confirm  the participant has  completed the  PRO assessments.  
• If the HCP  is unable  to collect  AEs,  concomitant  medications  or contraception  use, 
the site should contact [CONTACT_135388] a follow -up telephone call to collect the 
additional information. 
It is recommended  that the investigator  discuss  temporary  or permanent  discontinuation of 
study intervention with the study medical monitor. 
8.1.3. Mobile Visits  
In the event that an in -person visit is not feasible at the site, the following may  be performed 
by a licensed  healthcare professional  at an alternate  site approved  by [CONTACT_11168]  (see the 
SoA): 
• Review  and record  study intervention(s), including  compliance and  missed  doses.

additional information. 
8.1.4. Telehealth  Visits  
Telehealth  visits  are not intended to replace in-person visits;  however, may be used to assess 
participant safety and collect data points if an in -person visit is unable to be performed.  
Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare information and services via telecommunication  technologies  (eg, audio, video,  videoconferencing software)  remotely, 
allowing the participant and the investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and safety monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit (see the SoA ): 
• Review  and record  any AEs and SAEs  since the  last contact.  Refer  to Section  8.4. 
• Review  and record  any new concomitant  medications  or changes  in concomitant 
medications since the last contact.  
• Review  and record  contraceptive method and results  of pregnancy  testing.  Confirm 
that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. Refer to Appendix 4. 
• Collect  vital signs  (pulse  and O
2 saturation  using  pulse  oximeter  device at home; 
temperature if available).  
Study participants  must  be reminded  to promptly  notify site staff about  any change  in their 
health status.

and symptoms of COVID -19, and PRO assessments in the study diary. 
Participants  will receive daily  reminders  to complete entries  on their own as specified  in the 
SoA. The diary should be completed at approximately the same time every day. Staff will 
review the participant’s study diary online as specified in the SoA . 
The diary allows recording of these assessments only within a fixed time window (next calendar day), thus providing an accurate representation of the participant’s experience at  
that time. The participant is able to make revisions to incorrect entries before pressing the save or submit button. In the event that a participant becomes aware of an error in data after the entry is saved, a change to the diary data may only be made by [CONTACT_770450] a data clarification form. Data reported in the participant diary  will be transferred 
electronically  to a third -party  vendor, where they will be available for review  by [CONTACT_493764] -based portal. 
8.2.2. COVID- 19-Related  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770386] ’ COVID -19-related  medical visits  (ie, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770387], 
urgent care, emergency room ≤24h) will be collected during study visits, including level of 
care (ICU status) and dates of utilization, including admission and discharge, as applicable.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  >24 hours  is defined  as >24h of acute care in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770388], including Emergency Rooms or temporary facilities instituted to address medical 
needs of those with severe COVID -19. This includes specialized acute medical care unit 
within an assisted living facility or nursing home. This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_295363]/or clinical trial execution. 
8.2.3. Oxygen  Support  Details  
Type  of oxygen support  (eg, oxygen supplementation received,  mechanical  ventilation  or 
ECMO received in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) will be collected.  
8.2.4. PRO  Assessments  
Only  adult  study participants  ≥18 years  of age at the time of screening  will be asked  to 
complete PRO assessments. PRO assessments will be recorded in the study ediary.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Global Impression Questions  
Three questions will be included in the ePRO to assess patient -reported global impression 
items: a) return  to usual  health;  b) return  to usual  activities; and c) overall  COVID -19-related 
symptoms.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. SF-36 v2® Health  Survey  (Acute  Form)  
SF-36 v2® Health Survey (the acute form) is a 36 -item questionnaire that measures 
functional  health  and well-being from  a patient’s  perspective  over 1-week  recall  period. It  is 
a generic questionnaire and can be used across age (adults), disease, and treatment groups. 
The questionnaire consists of 8 health domain scales: physical functioning (10 items), 
role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health (5 items), vitality (4 items), 
social functioning (2 items), role -emotional (3 items), mental health (5 items), reported  
health  transition  (1 item)  and 2, physical  and mental  component  summary  scores.  Each  health 
domain scale raw score is transformed to 0 -100 scale which can then be converted to  
norm -based  T-scores  (Mean=50,  SD=10). SF-36 v2® Health  Survey will be completed  as 
specified in the SoA . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. WPAI  
COVID- 19 impacts manual and office -based work, and results in missed work due to illness 
or quarantine  and loss of productivity.32 The WPAI -GH is being  implemented  for COVID -19 
(ie, WPAI -COVID -19) in order to evaluate change from baseline in work burdens. The 
WPAI -GH has demonstrated validity, reliability and sufficient predictive value to measure 
the impact  of disease on absenteeism,  presenteeism,  and overall  productivity in a manner  that 
can also be monetized. 33 
The WPAI -COVID -19 consists of 6 questions that refer to the following assessments for 
work productivity: 1 = currently employed, 2 = hours missed due to health problems, 3 = hours missed other reasons, 4 = hours actually worked, 5 = degree health affected productivity while working (using a 0 to 10 VAS), and 6 = degree health affected productivity in regular  unpaid activities.  The recall  period for questions  2 through 6 is 7 days. 
Four main outcomes will be generated from the WPAI -COVID -19 and reported as:  
1) percent  work  time missed  due to COVID- 19 for those  who are currently  employed,  
2) percent impairment while working due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1057294] 7 days, 3) percent overall work impairment due to 
COVID- 19 for those who are currently employed, and 4) percent activity impairment due to 
COVID- 19 for all respondents.
33 The WPAI -COVID -19 will be completed  during site visits, 
as specified in the SoA . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. EQ-5D-5L Scale  
The EQ-5D is a validated,  standardized,  generic instrument that is a preference- based  health 
related quality of life questionnaire in cost effectiveness and HTA.34-36 Recently, a version 
was developed called EQ -5D-5L with 5 response levels on each dimension compared to the 
3 response levels in the EQ -5D-3L.34-40 
Measurement properties of the EQ -5D-5L demonstrated to be a valid version of the 3 level 
questionnaire that improved measurements by [CONTACT_770451], reducing the ceiling, and establishing convergent and known groups validity.
34,36,38,39 Both the EuroQol 
EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L versions  are well established  instruments  used to measure health 
states and utilities in various diseases areas and assess mobility, self care, usual activities,

8.2.5. COVID- 19 Signs  and Symptoms  
On Day 1, participants will complete the COVID -19 signs and symptoms ( Appendix 10) in 
the study diary, before receiving study intervention. COVID -19-related symptoms will be 
evaluated in accordance with FDA guidelines. Participants will record a rating of their 
symptom  severity  over the past 24 hours  based  on a 4-point  scale in which  0 is reported  if no 
symptoms were present; 1 if mild; 2 if moderate; and 3 if severe.  
 
Vomiting  and diarrhea will each be rated  on a 4-point  frequency  scale  where  0 is reported  for 
no occurrence, 1 for 1 to 2 times, 2 for 3 to 4 times, and 3 for 5 or greater.  
 
Sense of smell and sense of taste will each be rated on a 3 -point Likert scale where 0 is 
reported  if the sense of smell/taste  was the same as  usual, 1 if the sense  of smell/taste  was 
less than usual, and 2 for no sense of smell/taste.  
8.3. Safety  Assessments  
Planned  time  points  for all safety  assessments  are provided in  the SoA . Unscheduled safety 
measurements may  be obtained at any  time during the study to assess any  perceived safety 
issues.  
8.3.1. Targeted  Physical  Examinations  
Physical  examinations to  be completed before administration of study  intervention.  
A targeted  physical  examination  will include, at a minimum,  cardiopulmonary assessments. 
Investigators should pay special attention to any previously identified or new AE/targeted condition that the participant  has experienced. Height  and weight  will also be measured  and 
recorded  at screening, though height  may be self-reported  for participants  ≥[ADDRESS_1057295] physical 
examination findings that are identified during the active collection period and meet the 
definition of an AE or SAE ( Appendix 3) must be reported according to the processes in

 If such values  do not return  to normal/baseline  within  a period of time judged reasonable by 
[CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified.  
See Appendix [ADDRESS_1057299] abnormalities.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Alternative Facilities  for Clinical Safety  Laboratory Assessment  
If a local laboratory is used, qualified study site personnel must order, receive, and review 
results. Site staff must collect the local laboratory reference ranges and certifications/ accreditations  for filing  at the site. Laboratory test results  are to be provided  to the site staff 
as soon as possible . The local laboratory reports should be  filed in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory report should be recorded  on the CRF.  
8.3.5. Pregnancy  Testing  
A serum or urine pregnancy test is required at screening. Following screening, pregnancy tests may be urine or serum tests, and must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL. Pregnancy  tests will be performed in WOCBP at the times listed in the SoA . Pregnancy tests 
will also be done  whenever  1 menstrual  cycle is missed  during the active treatment period (or 
when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected) and at Day 44 or ET visit. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_1202]/ECs or if required by [CONTACT_427]. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (eg, an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is 
required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded if the serum pregnancy result is positive.  
For female pediatric  participant  who  becomes  pregnant, this  information  will be  shared  with 
the study participant’s parent/guardian if the participant’s age is within specific range based 
on local/country regulations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. At-Home  Pregnancy  Testing  
A home  urine  pregnancy  testing  kit with a sensitivity  of at least 25 mIU/mL  may be used  by 
[CONTACT_22860], if compliant with local regulatory  requirements. 
The pregnancy test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol. 
8.4. Adverse Events,  Serious  Adverse Events,  and Other Safety  Reporting  
The definitions  of an AE and an SAE  can be found in  Appendix 3 . 
AEs may  arise from symptoms or other complaints reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_2416]  (or, when  appropriate,  by a caregiver,  surrogate, or the participant’s  legally

 authorized  representative),  or they may arise from  clinical  findings  of the investigator  or 
other healthcare providers (clinical signs, test results, etc).  
The investigator  and any qualified  designees  are responsible  for detecting,  documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue 
and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the 
event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7.1).  
During the active collection  period as described  in Section  8.4.1, each participant/parent/legal 
guardian/legally authorized representative will be questioned about the occurrence of  AEs in 
a nonleading manner.  
In addition, the investigator  may be requested  by [CONTACT_770453] -up 
information in an expedited fashion.  
8.4.1. Time  Period  and Frequency  for Collecting  AE and SAE  Information  
The time period for actively eliciting and collecting  AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”)  for each participant  begins  from  the time the participant  provides  informed  consent, 
which is obtained before undergoing any study- related procedure and/or receiving study 
intervention, through and including a minimum of [ADDRESS_1057300] be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety 
immediately upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after the 
participant  has concluded  study participation.  However,  if the investigator  learns  of any SAE,

report the SAE to [COMPANY_007] using the PSSA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting  SAEs  to [COMPANY_007] Safety  
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in Section 8.4.1 are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety using PSSA  immediately upon awareness and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. The investigator  will submit  any updated SAE  data to the sponsor  within  24 hours  of its being 
available.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording  Nonserious  AEs and SAEs  on the CRF  
All nonserious  AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which  begins  after obtaining informed  consent  as described  in Section  8.4.1, will be recorded 
on the AE section of the CRF. 
The investigator  is to record  on the CRF  all directly  observed and all spontaneously reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by [CONTACT_2299].  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by [CONTACT_456], any nonserious AE that is 
determined  by [CONTACT_770454].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study.  
Reporting of AEs and SAEs  for participants  who fail screening  are subject  to the CRF 
requirements as described in Section 5.4. 
8.4.2. Method  of Detecting  AEs and SAEs  
The method of recording,  evaluating, and assessing  causality  of AEs and SAEs  and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. Care will be taken  not to introduce  bias when  detecting  AEs and/or  SAEs.  Open -ended  and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.4.3. Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization,  the event  is otherwise  explained, 
or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3).  
In general,  follow -up information  will include  a description  of the event  in sufficient  detail  to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications

Page  [ADDRESS_1057302]  the safety  of participants  and the safety  of a 
study intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory  authority  and other 
regulatory agencies  about  the safety  of a study intervention under  clinical  investigation.  The 
sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/ECs, and investigators. Investigator  safety  reports  must  be prepared  for S[LOCATION_003]Rs  according  to local  regulatory 
requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives S[LOCATION_003]Rs or other specific safety information (eg, summary or 
listing  of SAEs)  from  the sponsor  will review  and then file it along with  the SRSD(s)  for the 
study and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 
8.4.5. Environmental  Exposure,  Exposure  During  Pregnancy  or Breastfeeding,  and 
Occupational Exposure  
Environmental exposure occurs when a person not enrolled in the study as a participant 
receives unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_273478]. Such exposure 
may or may not lead to the occurrence of an  AE or SAE. Persons at risk for environmental 
exposure  include  healthcare providers, family  members,  and others  who may be exposed. An 
environmental exposure may include EDP, EDB, and occupational exposure. 
Any such exposures  to the study intervention under  study are reportable to [COMPANY_007]  Safety 
within 24 hours of investigator awareness.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy  
An EDP  occurs  if: 
• A female participant  is found to be newly  pregnant  while  receiving  or after 
discontinuing study intervention. 
• A male  participant  who is receiving  or has discontinued study intervention 
inseminates a female partner.  
• A female nonparticipant  is found to be pregnant  while  being exposed or having been 
exposed to study intervention because of environmental exposure. Below are 
examples of environmental EDP:  
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 
Protocol C4671034  
Final  Protocol  Amendment  01, 13 September  2022  
PFIZER  CONFIDENTIAL  
CT02 -GSOP  Clinical Protocol  Template  Phase  1 2 3 4 (01 April  2022)  
Page  74  
 • A female family  member  or healthcare provider  reports  that she is pregnant  after 
having been exposed to the study intervention by [CONTACT_78262]. 
• A male  family  member  or healthcare  provider  who has been  exposed  to the study 
intervention by [CONTACT_219891].  
The investigator must report EDP  to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness,  irrespective  of whether  an SAE  has occurred.  The initial information  submitted 
should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). 
• If EDP occurs in a participant or participant’s partner, the investigator must report  
this information to [COMPANY_007] Safety using the EDP Supplemental form within PSSA, regardless  of whether  an SAE  has occurred. Details  of the pregnancy will be collected 
after the start of study intervention and until a minimum of [ADDRESS_1057303] administration of study intervention. 
• If EDP  occurs  in the setting  of environmental  exposure, the investigator  must  report 
information to [COMPANY_007] Safety using PSSA. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF;  however, a  copy  of the completed  case report  from  PSSA  is maintained  in the 
investigator site file.  
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for 
all EDP  reports  with an unknown outcome. The investigator  will follow  the pregnancy until 
completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] Safety of the outcome as a follow -up using PSSA. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can 
be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified  and, if clinically  possible, the structural  integrity  of the terminated  fetus 
should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).  
Abnormal  pregnancy  outcomes  are considered  SAEs.  If the outcome  of the pregnancy  meets 
the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly in a live -born baby, a terminated fetus, an 
intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.  Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety as SAEs follows:  
• Spontaneous  abortion including miscarriage and missed  abortion should be reported 
as an SAE;  
• Neonatal  deaths  that occur  within  [ADDRESS_1057304] 
to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as  
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir

Page  75  
 SAEs  when  the investigator  assesses the infant  death  as related  or possibly related  to 
exposure to the study intervention.  
Additional information regarding the EDP  may be requested by [CONTACT_456]. Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delays). In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator  will provide  the participant  with the Pregnant  Partner  Release of Information  
Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant  was given  the Pregnant  Partner  Release of Information  Form  to provide  to his 
partner.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding  
An EDB  occurs  if: 
• A female participant  is found to be breastfeeding  while  receiving  or after 
discontinuing study intervention. 
• A female nonparticipant  is found to be breastfeeding  while  being exposed or having 
been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental EDB is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports that she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by [CONTACT_78262].  
The investigator must report EDB to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the PSSA. When EDB occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure 
information  does not pertain  to the participant  enrolled  in the study, so the information  is not 
recorded on a CRF. However, a copy of the completed SAE Case Report from PSSA  is 
maintained in the investigator site file.  
An EDB report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accordance with authorized use. However,  if the infant  experiences  an SAE  associated  with such a drug,  the SAE  is reported 
together with the EDB.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure  
The investigator must report any instance of occupational exposure to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness using the PSSA, regardless of whether there is an associated  SAE.  Since the information  about  the occupational  exposure  does not pertain  to a 
participant  enrolled  in the study, the  information  is not recorded  on a  CRF;  however, a  copy 
of the completed SAE Case Report from PSSA  must be maintained in the investigator site 
file.

 Medication  errors  include:  
• Medication  errors  involving participant  exposure  to the  study intervention;  
• Potential medication  errors  or uses outside  of what  is foreseen  in the protocol  that 
do or do not involve the study participant. 
• The administration of expi[INVESTIGATOR_336249];  
• The administration of an incorrect study intervention;  
• The administration  of an incorrect  dosage;  
• The administration of study intervention that has undergone temperature 
excursion from  the specified  storage  range,  unless  it is determined  by [CONTACT_770455].  
Such  medication  errors  occurring  to a study participant  are to be captured  on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the  AE page.  
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by [CONTACT_1149], as determined by [CONTACT_1275], the medication  error is recorded  on the medication  error page of the CRF  and, if 
applicable, any  associated  AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on the  AE page of the 
CRF.  
In the event  of a medication  dosing error,  the sponsor  should be notified  within  24 hours.  
Medication  errors  should  be reported  to [COMPANY_007]  Safety  within  24 hours  using  PSSA  only when 
associated with an SAE.  
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  
A blood sample of approximately 1 mL, to provide approximately 0.5 mL plasma, will be collected  for measuring  plasma  concentrations  of nirmatrelvir  and ritonavir  (if feasible)  as 
specified in the SoA . 
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the laboratory manual  or by [CONTACT_456]. The actual  date and time (24-hour clock  time)  of each 
sample will be recorded.  
The actual times may change, but the number of samples will remain the same. All efforts will be made to obtain the samples  at the exact  nominal  time relative  to dosing. Collection  of 
the baseline sample obtained <[ADDRESS_1057305] time of the collection is noted on the source document and the CRF. This protocol deviation does not apply to samples that are specified to be collected “at any time”.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Endpoint(s)  
The primary  endpoint, summarized  separately  for the main  study population  and the 
population with rebound, is the proportion of participants with sustained NP swab 
SARS -CoV -2 RNA <LLOQ  (defined  as <2.0 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL)  from  Day  15 through Day  44. 
Sustained  is defined  as NP swab  SARS -CoV -2 RNA level  not ≥2.0 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  at any 
study visit (through Day  44) following the  first study visit where the  participant's  NP swab 
SARS -CoV -2 RNA <LLOQ.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Main  Analytical Approach  
The primary descriptive analysis will summarize, separately for the main study population 
and the population with rebound, the number and proportion of participants with sustained 
NP swab SARS -CoV -2 RNA <LLOQ (defined as <2.0 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from Day [ADDRESS_1057310]-baseline for the treatment 
of COVID -19 will be considered as not achieving sustained NP swab SARS -CoV -2 RNA 
<LLOQ  in the primary  analysis. In addition, 95% CIs for the proportion of participants  with 
sustained NP swab SARS -CoV -2 RNA <LLOQ from Day 15 through Day 44 for each 
treatment  arm will be calculated.  The difference in proportions  for the primary  endpoint  and 
associated 95% CI will be calculated for each pairwise comparison of the treatment arms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Supplementary Analysis/Analyses  
Supplemental  analyses  will be performed  for the  primary  efficacy  endpoint:  
1. An analysis  of the primary  endpoint  will be conducted excluding data after the date of 
non-study antiviral or monoclonal antibody start for participants receiving non- study 
antiviral or monoclonal antibody therapy post -baseline for the treatment of  
COVID -19. 
2. An analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted to include all NP swab SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1057311]- baseline for the treatment of COVID -19. 
9.3.3. Secondary Endpoint(s)/Estimand(s) Analysis  
Details  on the definitions  and analyses  of secondary endpoints  will be described  in the SAP. 
Secondary endpoints include:  
• Time  to first NP swab  SARS -CoV -2 RNA<LLOQ (<2.0  log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL)  for 
participants with NP swab SARS -CoV -2 RNA ≥LLOQ at baseline.  
• Time  to sustained  NP swab  SARS -CoV -2 RNA <LLOQ  (<2.0 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) 
through Day 44 for participants with NP swab SARS -CoV -2 RNA ≥LLOQ at 
baseline.

 9.3.6. Other Analyses  
Pharmacogenomic  and/or  biomarker  data from  samples  collected  as described  in the SoA, as 
well as Retained Research Samples may be retained for future analyses; the results of such 
analyses are not planned to be included in the CSR. 
Rates  of detection  of cell culture  infectious  virus  over time will be characterized  during the 
trial and will be reported in a separate report outside of the CSR. PRO  data (SF-36, WPAI,  EQ-5D-5L, and global  impression questions)  will be collected 
during the trial and are not planned to be included in the CSR.  
Results  from population PK  analyses will be  reported in a  separate report outside of the CSR.  
9.4. Interim  Analyses  
No formal  interim analysis  will be  conducted for this study. 
9.5. Sample Size Determination  
Up to approximately 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. 
The study will randomize approximately 150 participants in a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, 
resulting in approximately 50 participants in each treatment arm (main study population). In addition, the study will also enroll up to 50 additional nonhospi[INVESTIGATOR_770366]  (in a 1:1:1 randomization ratio)  who are immunocompromised with a rebound in 
COVID- 19 within 14 days following completion of an initial 5- day treatment course of 
nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (population with rebound).  
Analyses will be conducted after the main study population is fully enrolled and have completed the Day [ADDRESS_1057312] completed the Week 24 visit. In addition, both analyses (primary and follow -up) will include separate results for the main study 
population and the additional population with rebound. 
As no formal hypothesis testing will be performed for this study, no power calculation was 
carried  out to assess the number  of participants  required  for each  treatment arm.  For the main 
study population, the goal of the primary analysis is to estimate the treatment effect for each duration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.  The smaller  numbers  of participants  in these groups  will be 
reflected in the precision of the estimate of the primary endpoint. Table [ADDRESS_1057313]  sizes  would be excluded based  on the expected  width  of the confidence interval  around 
the estimate of the proportion of participants with sustained NP swab SARS -CoV -2 RNA 
<LLOQ  (defined  as <2.0 log
10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL)  from  Day 15 through Day  44 with a sample  size 
of 50.

10.1.2. Financial Disclosure  
Investigators  and subinvestigators  will provide  the sponsor  with  sufficient,  accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible  for providing information  on financial  interests  during the course  of the study 
and for 1 year after completion of the study. 
10.1.3. Informed  Consent/Assent  Process  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Informed  Consent  Process  
The investigator or the investigator’s representative will explain the nature of the study, 
including the risks and benefits, to the participant or their legally authorized representative and answer all questions regarding the study. The participant or their legally authorized representative should be given sufficient  time and opportunity to ask questions  and to decide 
whether or not to participate in the trial.  
Participants  must  be informed  that their participation  is voluntary. Participants  or their legally 
authorized  representative  (if allowed  by [CONTACT_56819])  will be required  to sign a statement 
of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, privacy and data protection requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/EC or study center.  
The investigator  must  ensure  that each participant  or their legally  authorized representative is 
fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study, the sharing of data related to the 
study, and  possible  risks  associated  with  participation, including the  risks  associated  with  the 
processing of the participant’s personal data.  
The participant  or their legally  authorized  representative must  be informed  that their personal 
study- related data will be used by [CONTACT_10999].  
The level  of disclosure  must  also be explained  to the participant  or their legally  authorized 
representative.

local regulations.  
A copy of the ICD(s)  must  be provided to the participant  or their legally  authorized 
representative (if allowed by [CONTACT_427]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Informed  Assent  Process  
The investigator or their representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
participant  and their parent(s)/legal  guardian and answer  all questions  regarding  the 
study. The participant  and their parent(s)/legal  guardian  should be given  sufficient  time and 
opportunity to ask questions and to decide whether or not to participate in the trial. 
When consent is obtained from a participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian, the participant’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must be subsequently obtained when the participant has the capacity  to provide  assent,  as determined  by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. If  the investigator  determines  that a 
participant’s decisional capacity is so limited they cannot reasonably be consulted, then, as permitted by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the 
participant’s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the study participant does not provide their own assent, the source documents must record why the participant did not provide assent (for example, the child is not of assenting age per local regulations or policies), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent  was the participant’s  parent(s)/legal  guardian, the consent  signer’s 
relationship to the study participant, and that the participant’s assent was obtained or  
waived.  If assent  is obtained verbally, it must  be documented  in the source  documents.  
If study participants  are minors  who reach  the age of majority  or if a child  reaches  the age of 
assent (per local IRB/EC requirements) during the study, as recognized under local law, the child or adolescent must then provide the appropriate assent or consent to document their willingness to continue in the study. For an adolescent who reaches the age of consent, parental consent would no longer be valid. If the enrollment of emancipated minors is permitted by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC and local law, the participant must provide documentation of legal 
status to give consent without the permission of a legally authorized representative. 
Participants and their parent(s)/legal guardian must be informed that their participation is 
voluntary. The Participant’s  parent(s)/legal  guardian will be required  to sign a statement  of 
informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH 
guidelines, HIPAA requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/EC or study center.

The investigator  may initiate  study- site closure  at any time upon notification  to the sponsor 
or designee/CRO if requested to do so by [CONTACT_22846]/EC or if such termination is 
required to protect the health of study participants.  
Reasons  for the early  closure of a study site by [CONTACT_219900]: 
• Failure  of the investigator  to comply with the protocol, the requirements  of the 
IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or the ICH GCP guidelines;  
• Inadequate recruitment of  participants by [CONTACT_093];  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the ECs/IRBs,  the regulatory authorities,  and any CRO(s)  used in the study of 
the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_770458]/ritonavir

appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up. 
Study termination  is also provided for in the clinical study agreement.  If there  is any conflict 
between the contract and this protocol, the contract will control as to termination rights. 
10.1.10. Publication  Policy  
For multicenter trials, the primary publication will be a joint publication developed by [CONTACT_770459](s)  of the study covering all study sites. 
The investigator agrees to refer to the primary publication in any subsequent publications. [COMPANY_007] will not provide any financial compensation for the investigator’s  participation in the 
preparation  of the primary  congress  abstract,  poster, presentation, or  primary  manuscript  for 
the study. 
Investigators are free to publish individual center results that they deem to be clinically 
meaningful after publication of the overall results of the study or [ADDRESS_1057322]  to the other 
requirements described in this section. 
The investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] an opportunity to review any proposed publication or  
any other type of disclosure of the study results (collectively, “publication”) before it is 
submitted or otherwise disclosed and will submit all publications to [COMPANY_007] [ADDRESS_1057323], remove any previously undisclosed confidential  information  before  disclosure, except  for any study- intervention  or [COMPANY_007] -related 
information necessary for the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the  
study results. For joint publications, should there be disagreement regarding interpretation 
and/or presentation of specific analysis results, resolution of, and responsibility for, such disagreements will be the collective responsibility of all authors of the publication. 
For all publications relating to the study, the investigator and [COMPANY_007] will comply with 
recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including those established by [CONTACT_4717]. The investigator will disclose  any relationship  with [COMPANY_007]  and any relevant  potential  conflicts  of interest,  including 
any financial or personal relationship with [COMPANY_007], in any publications. All authors will have access to the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports (in their original format) required to develop the publication. 
10.1.11. Sponsor’s Medically Qualified Individual

 To facilitate access to their investigator and the sponsor’s MQI for study- related medical 
questions or problems from non- study healthcare professionals, participants are provided 
with an ECC  at the time of informed  consent. The ECC  contains, at a minimum,  (a) protocol 
and study intervention identifiers, (b) participant’s study identification number, (c) site 
emergency phone number active 24 hours/day, 7 days per week, and (d) [COMPANY_007] Call Center number.  
The ECC is intended to augment, not replace, the established communication pathways between  the participant  and their investigator  and site staff,  and between  the investigator  and 
sponsor study team. The ECC is only to be used by [CONTACT_219904], as a means  of reaching  the investigator  or site staff related  to the care of a 
participant. The [COMPANY_007] Call Center number is to be used when the investigator and site staff are unavailable.  The [COMPANY_007] Call Center number is not for use by [CONTACT_240875]; if a 
participant calls that number directly, they will be directed back to the investigator site.

 10.2. Appendix  2: Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The following safety  laboratory  tests will be performed  at times  defined in the SoA section  of 
this protocol. Additional laboratory results may be reported on these samples as a result of 
the method of analysis or the type of analyzer used by [CONTACT_20019], or as derived from calculated values. These additional tests would not require additional collection of blood. Unscheduled clinical  laboratory measurements  may  be obtained at  any time during the 
study to assess any perceived safety issues. 
If deemed  necessary  to confirm  eligibility,  additional laboratory assessments at screening 
may be performed at the local laboratory at the investigator’s discretion.

10.3.1. Definition of AE 
 
AE Definition  
•  An AE is any  untoward  medical occunence in a patient or clinical  study 
paiiic ipant, tempora lly assoc iated with the use of study  interventio n, whether or not 
conside red re lated to the study interventio n. 
 
• Note:  An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable  and u nintended sign (includ ing an 
abno1mal  laborato1y  finding), symptom , or disease ( new or exacerbated) 
tempora lly assoc iated with the use of study intervention.  
 
 
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
•  Any abno1mal  laborato 1y test results  (hematology , clinical chemistiy, or urina lysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, ECG , radiol ogical  scans,  vital sign measurements) , 
including those t hat worsen from  baseline, cons idered clin ically significa nt in the 
medical and  scientific judgment of the invest igator. Any abno 1mal laborato 1y test 
results that meet any  of the co nditio ns below must be  recorded as an AE:  
 
• Is associated  with accompa nying symptoms.  
 
• Requir es additiona l diagnost ic testing or medicaVs urgical  intervention.  
 
•  Leads  to a change in study  dosing  (outside  of any protoco l-specified  dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from  the study , significa nt addit ional 
conc01nita nt drng ti·eatment,  or othe r therapy.  
 
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or inte1mittent p reexisting cond ition, includ ing an 
increase in either frequency a nd/or intensity of the cond ition.  
• New conditio n detected  or diagnosed after study  intervention adtninisti·ation , even

Events  Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any clinically  significa nt abno1mal  laborato 1y finding s or other abno1mal  safety 
assessme nts that are associate d with the underlying  disease,  unless judged by  [CONTACT_770462] r the paiticipant 's cond ition.  
 
• The disease /disorder being  studied  or expected  progression , signs,  or symptom s of 
the disease /disorder being studied , unless more  severe than expected for t he 
paitic ipant's condition. 
 
• Medical  or surgical  procedure (eg, endoscopy, appe ndectomy):  the cond ition t hat

10.3.2. Definition  of an SAE  
 
An SAE  is defined as  any untoward medical occurrence that,  at any dose , meets  one 
or more of the criteria listed below:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening  
The te1m "life-threatening" in the defin ition of "serious" refers  to an event in which the 
paitic ipant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does  not refer  to an  event that 
hypothetica lly might have caused death if it were more severe. 
c.  Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219855] , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770393] s that the paiticipant h as been admitted (usually 
involving  at least an overn ight stay)  at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770394]·d for obse rvation 
and/o r treatment that would not have been appropr iate in the physician's office o r 
outpatie nt setting . Comp lications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n ai·e AEs. If a 
complicat ion prolong s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770395] s any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. Whe n in doubt as to whet her "hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]" occuned o r was neces saiy, the 
AE should be considered ser ious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54725] a preexi sting cond ition t hat did not wo rsen 
from baseline is not conside red an AE.

d. Result s in persistent or significant  disability /incapacity  
• The te1m  disability mean s a substantial  disrnption of a person's ability to  conduct 
nonnal life functions . 
•  This definition is not intended  to include  exper iences of relatively minor  medical 
significance,  such as uncomplicated headache , nausea , vomit ing, diaiThea,  
influenza , and accide ntal trauma (eg, sprained ankle),  that may interfe re with or 
prevent eve1yday life functions but do not  constitute a substantial disrnpt ion. 
e. Is a congenital  anomal y/birth defect  
f. Is a suspected tran smission via a [COMPANY_007]  product  of an infectious  agent , pathogenic 
or nonpathogenic  
The event  may be suspected from  clinical  symptoms  or laborato1 y finding s indicat ing 
an infectio n in a pa1ticipant exposed to a [COMPANY_007] product. The  tenns "su spected 
transmission" and "transmi ssion " are considered syno nymous. These cases a re

• Medical  or scientific judgment  should  be exercised by  [CONTACT_770464]1ting is approp riate in other situations,  such as significant  
medical  events that may jeopardize the paiticipant o r may require  medic al or 
surgical  interventio n to preve nt one of the other outcomes  listed in the above 
definit ion. These events should usually be co nsidered ser ious. 
• Example s of such events  include  invasive  or malignant cancers , intensive treatment 
in an eme rgency room  or at home for alle rgic bronc hospasm , blood dyscras ias or 
convu lsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689], or deve lopment of  diug

•  The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis  of the event based  on signs , 
symptoms , and/or other clinical info1mat ion. Wheneve r possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs /symptoms)  will be docume nted as the AE or SAE.  
Assessment of Inten sity 
The investigator wi ll make an  assessment of intensity for each AE a nd SAE reported 
during  the study and assign it to 1 of t he following catego ries, which are based  on the 
DAIDS  Table for Grading  the Sever ity of Adult  and Pediatric Adverse Events43, version

An event  is defined  as "serious" when it meets  at least  1 of the predefi ned outcomes  as 
descr ibed in t he definit ion of an SAE , NOT wh en it is rated as severe.  
 
 
Assessment of Causality 
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship between  study  interventio n 
and each occu nence of each AE or SAE . The investigator wi ll use cl inical 
judgme nt to dete 1mine the relations hip. 
 
• A "reasonable possib ility" of a relatio nship conveys that there ar e facts, ev idence, 
and/o r argume nts to suggest  a causal  relatio nship, rather than a relatio nship cannot 
be rn led out. 
• Alternative causes , such as underly ing disease(s),  concomita nt therapy,  and other 
risk fac tors, as well as the temporal  relationship of  the event to study intervention 
administration , will be considered and investigated . 
 
• The investigator  will also consult the IB and/or prod uct info1matio n, for marketed 
products , in their assessme nt. 
 
• For each AE or SAE , the investigator must document  in the medical  notes  that they 
have reviewed the AE or SAE and have prov ided an  assessment of causa lity. 
 
• There may be situat ions in which an SAE  has occm Ted and  the investigato r has 
minimal  info1mat ion to include  in the initial repo1i to the sponsor. However , it is

very important that  the investigator always make an assessment of causality 
for every  event  before the  initial transmission of  the SAE  data to the sponsor.  
• The investigator may change their opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up 
info1mati on and send an SAE follow-up repo1t with the updated  causality 
assessm ent. 
 
• The causality assessm ent is one of the criteria used when dete1minin g regulato1y 
repo1ting requirements. 
 
•  If the investigator does not know wh ether or not the study intervention caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as "related to study intervention" for repo1ting 
pmposes, as de fined by [CONTACT_78269]. In a ddition, if the investigator detennines that 
an SAE is assoc iated with study proced ures, the investigator mu st record this 
causal relationship in  the source documents and CRF, and repo1t such an 
assessm ent in t he dedicated section of PSSA and  in acco rdance w ith the SAE 
repo1ting requirements. 
 
 
Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
•  The investigator is obligated  to perfonn or aiTan ge for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations, as m edically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_103], to elucidate the nature and/o r causality o f the AE  or SAE as full y as 
possible. This may includ e add itional laborato 1y tests or investigations, 
histopathological exainin ations, or consultation with other healthcai·e providers. 
 
• If a paiticipant dies durin g pa1ticipation in t he study or during a recog nized 
follow-up pe riod, the investigator will prov ide [COMPANY_007] Safety with a copy  of any 
postmo1tem fin dings, inclu ding histopathology. 
• New o r updated infonnation will be recorded in the originally submi tted 
documents. 
• The investigator will subinit  any updated SAE data to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1057327]  
• The prim aiy mechanism for reporting an SAE  to [COMPANY_007] Safety  will be the 
electro nic DCT (eSAE or PSSA) .

• If the electronic syste m is unavailable, then the site will use the pape r fonn (see 
next section) to repo1i the event within 24 hours. 
 
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic DCT (eg, eSAE or PSSA)  or

•  After the study is completed at a given site, the electro nic DCT  will be taken 
off-line to p revent the entiy of new data or changes to exist ing data . 
 
• If a site receives  a repo1i of a new SAE from a study paiiic ipant or receives updated 
data on a previously repo1ied SAE after the electi·onic DCT has been taken off-line, 
then the site can report this infonnatio n on a paper SAE fonn (see next section) or 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety by [CONTACT_756]. 
 
 
SAE  Reporting  to [COMPANY_007] Safety  via the CT SAE  Report  Form  
• Facsimile ti-ansmission of the CT SAE Repo1i Fo1m is the prefened method to 
ti·ansrnit this infonnation to [COMPANY_007] Safety . 
 
•  In circumstances when the facsimile is not wo rking, an alternative method should

 10.4. Appendix  4: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance  
10.4.1. Male Participant Reproductive Inclusion  Criteria  
No contraception methods are required for male participants in this study, as the calculated 
safety  margin  is ≥100 fold between  the estimated  maternal  exposure due to seminal  transfer 
and the NOAEL  for serious manifestations of developmental toxicity  in nonclinical studies.  
10.4.2. Female Participant  Reproductive Inclusion  Criteria  
The criteria below are part of Inclusion Criterion 1 (Age and Sex; Section 5.1) and specify the reproductive requirements for including female participants.  Refer  to Section  10.4.[ADDRESS_1057328] of contraceptive methods permitted in the study.  
• A female participant  is eligible  to participate  if at least 1 of the following conditions 
applies:  
• Is not a WOCBP (see definition in Section 10.4.3).  
• OR 
• Is a WOCBP  who is pregnant (at  least  14 weeks  gestation).  
• OR 
• Is a WOCBP  who is not pregnant at screening  and agrees  to use a highly effective 
contraceptive method (failure  rate of <1%  per year)  during the intervention  period 
and for at least [ADDRESS_1057329] dose of study intervention, which corresponds to the time needed to eliminate any reproductive safety risk of the study intervention(s). If a highly effective, user -dependent method is chosen, she 
agrees to concurrently use an effective barrier method of contraception. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. 
The investigator is responsible for review  of medical  history, menstrual  history, and recent 
sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.  
10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing  Potential  
A woman  is considered  fertile  following menarche and until becoming  postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility  is unclear  (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents  or athletes)  and a menstrual  cycle cannot 
be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.

 Women  in the following categories  are not considered  WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal.  
2. Premenopausal  female  with 1 of the following:  
• Documented  hysterectomy;  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656];  
• Documented  bilateral  oophorectomy.  
For individuals with permanent  infertility  due to a medical  cause other than the above (eg, 
mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to 
determining study entry. 
Note:  Documentation for any of the above categories  can come from  the site personnel’s 
review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history 
interview.  The method of documentation should be recorded  in the participant’s  medical 
record for the study. 
3. Postmenopausal female:  
• A postmenopausal state is defined  as no menses  for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. In addition:  
• A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range must be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women  under 50 years  of age and not using hormonal 
contraception or HRT. 
• A female on HRT  and whose menopausal status  is in doubt will be required  to use 
one of the highly effective nonestrogen hormonal contraception methods if she wishes to continue her HRT during the study. Otherwise, she must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
10.4.4. Contraception  Methods  
Contraceptive use by [CONTACT_770465]/regulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical trials. 
The following contraceptive methods are appropriate for this study: 
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency  
1. Implantable progestogen-only hormone contraception associated  with inhibition  of 
ovulation.  
2. Intrauterine device.

Page  108  
 3. Intrauterine hormone- releasing  system.  
4. Bilateral  tubal occlusion.  
5. Vasectomized  partner:  
• Vasectomized  partner  is a highly effective  contraceptive method provided that the 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has 
been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. The spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days. 
Highly Effective  Methods That Are User  Dependent  
6. Combined (estrogen - and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception  associated 
with inhibition of ovulation: 
• Oral + barrier*  
• Intravaginal + barrier*  
• Transdermal  + barrier*  
7. Progestogen-only hormone contraception associated  with inhibition  of ovulation:  
• Oral + barrier*  
• Injectable  + barrier* 
Sexual Abstinence 
8. Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability  of sexual  abstinence needs  to be evaluated 
in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
* Acceptable barrier methods to be used concomitantly  with options 6 or 7 for the study 
include any of the following: 
• Male or female condom, with or without spermicide;  
• Cervical  cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide;  
• A combination of male condom with either  cervical  cap, diaphragm, or sponge with 
spermicide (double-barrier methods). 
Because  ritonavir may reduce the effect  of estradiol -containing contraceptives  when  agents 
are co-administered,  a barrier method or other nonhormonal method of contraception  must

10.5. Appendix  5: Genetics 
Use/Analysis of DNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention, 
susceptibility to, and severity and progression of disease. Therefore, where local regulations  and IRBs/ECs  allow,  a blood sample  will be collected  for DNA analysis.  
• The scope  of the genetic research  may be narrow  (eg, 1 or more  candidate genes)  or 
broad (eg, the entire genome), as appropriate to the scientific question under investigation.  
• The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors involved in the response  to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  or study interventions  of this class  to 
understand treatments for the disease(s) under study or the disease(s) themselves. 
• The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the CSR or in a separate study summary, or may be used for internal  decision  making without  being included  in a 
study report.  
• The sponsor  will store  the DNA samples  in a secure storage  space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality. 
• The samples  will be retained  as indicated:  
• Retained  samples  will be stored  indefinitely  or for another  period as per local 
requirements.  
• Participants  may withdraw  their consent  for the storage  and/or  use of their Retained 
Research Samples at any time by [CONTACT_7328] a request to the investigator; in this case, any remaining material will be destroyed. Data already  generated from the samples 
will be retained to protect the integrity of existing analyses.  
• Samples  for genetic research  will be  labeled  with a code.  The key between  the code 
and the participant’s personally identifying information (eg, name, address) will be 
held securely at the study site.

 10.6. Appendix  6: Liver Safety:  Suggested  Actions  and Follow -Up Assessments and 
Study Intervention Rechallenge Guidelines  
Potential  Cases  of Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by [CONTACT_20023])  are termed  “tolerators,” while  those  who show  transient  liver injury but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.” In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participants fail to adapt and therefore are “susceptible” to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as DILI. Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 × ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are “adaptors” or are “susceptible.”  
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or  ALT precede T bili elevations (>2 × 
ULN)  by [CONTACT_749835].  The increase in T bili typi[INVESTIGATOR_770398]/ALT  is/are 
still elevated  above  3 × ULN  (ie, AST/ALT  and T bili values  will be elevated  within  the same 
laboratory sample). In rare instances, by [CONTACT_29623] T bili elevations are detected, AST/ALT 
values might have decreased. This occurrence is  still regarded  as a potential  DILI.  Therefore, 
abnormal  elevations  in either  AST  OR ALT  in addition to T bili that meet  the criteria  outlined 
below  are considered  potential  DILI (assessed  per Hy’s  law criteria)  cases  and should always 
be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.  
The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s  individual  baseline values  and underlying conditions. Participants  who present 
with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values:  
• Participants  with AST/ALT  and T bili baseline values  within  the normal  range  who 
subsequently present with AST OR ALT values ≥3 × ULN AND a T bili value  
≥2 × ULN with no evidence  of hemolysis  and an alkaline  phosphatase  value  
<2 × ULN or not available.  
• For participants  with baseline AST  OR ALT  OR T bili values  above  the ULN,  the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:  
• Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values  ≥2 times  the baseline values  AND ≥3 
× ULN;  or ≥8 × ULN (whichever  is 
smaller).  
• Preexisting  values  of T bili above  the normal  range:  T bili level  increased  from 
baseline value by [CONTACT_219911] ≥1 × ULN or if the value reaches ≥3 × ULN (whichever is smaller).

individually based  on clinical  judgment;  any case where uncertainty  remains  as to whether  it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.  
The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably  within  [ADDRESS_1057331] and  ALT and T bili for suspected Hy’s law 
cases, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT/INR, total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration should also be  given 
to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology.  A detailed history, including relevant information, such 
as review of ethanol, acetaminophen/paracetamol (either by [CONTACT_20025] a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications), recreational drug, or supplement 
(herbal)  use and consumption, family  history, sexual  history, travel  history, history of contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis  A, B, C, D, and E infection, liver imaging  (eg, biliary  tract),  and collection  of serum 
samples  for acetaminophen/paracetamol  drug and/or  protein adduct  levels  may be warranted.  
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of  AST/ALT  and 
T bili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases if no other  reason  for the LFT abnormalities  has yet been  found. Such potential  DILI  (Hy’s  law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. 
A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of 
reasonable investigations  have  been  received  and have excluded  an alternative  etiology.

 10.8. Appendix  8: Prohibited  Concomitant  Medications  That  May  Result  in DDI 
Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are both primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Therefore, 
concomitant use of any medications or substances that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 and that are contraindicated  in combination with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir  are prohibited without  the 
appropriate washout prior to the first dose of study intervention. 
A nonexhaustive list of prohibited and precautionary medications is provided below 
(Table 4 and Table 5 ). If a medication is not listed as contraindicated, it should not 
automatically  be assumed  it is safe to coadminister.  Appropriately qualified  site staff will 
review  all concomitant  medications  to determine  if they are prohibited. The [COMPANY_007]  study team 
is to be notified of any prohibited medications taken during the study. After consulting with the sponsor, the investigator will make a judgment on the ongoing participation of any participant with prohibited medication use during the study. 
This list of  drugs  prohibited for potential  DDI  concerns  with the study intervention may  be 
revised during the course of the study with written notification from sponsor, to include or 
exclude  specific  drugs  or drug categories  for various  reasons  (eg, emerging  DDI results  for 
the IMP, availability  of new information in literature on the DDI potential of other drugs).  
This is not an all-inclusive  list. Site staff  should consult  with  the sponsor  or designee  with 
any questions regarding potential DDI.

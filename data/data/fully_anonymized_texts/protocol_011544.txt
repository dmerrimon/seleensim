Ibuprofen plus/ minus APAP. randomized trial Version 07182018 2Specific Aims
More than 2.5 million patients present to US emergency departments (ED) annually with low back 
pain.(1) Up to ½ of ED patients with acute, new onset low back pain (LBP) report persistent moderate 
or severe pain one week after the ED visit.(2-5) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are 
an effective treatment of acute LBP, though their impact is only modest.(6) Combining NSAIDS with 
oxycodone,(3) skeletal muscle relaxants,(2, 3) or diazepam(5) does not improve outcomes. 
The role of acetaminophen in acute LBP is incompletely understood. Aggregated data suggest 
acetaminophen is ineffective monotherapy for acute LBP,(7) but only limited high quality data are 
available.(8) Similarly, only scant published data are available on the combination of NSAIDs + 
acetaminophen for acute LBP, though these data suggest the possibility of benefit.(9) 
Given the poor pain and functional outcomes that persist beyond an ED visit for acute LBP, we 
propose a clinical trial to determine whether combining acetaminophen with an NSAID is more 
effective than NSAID monotherapy for the treatment of acute, non-traumatic, non-radicular low back 
pain. We will test the following hypothesis:
A daily regimen of ibuprofen + acetaminophen will provide greater relief of LBP than ibuprofen + 
placebo one week after an ED visit, as measured by [CONTACT_909947]: 2018-9182

Ibuprofen plus/ minus APAP. randomized trial Version [ADDRESS_1277352] representation of patients with musculoskeletal back pain 
who are likely to respond to the investigational medications and who would not be considered 
candidates for spi[INVESTIGATOR_6844]. We hope for a widely generalizable 
study and therefore will not require diagnoses to be contingent on advanced imaging studies. 
Inclusion criteria:
-Present to ED primary for management of LBP, defined as pain originating between the lower border 
of the scapulae and the upper gluteal folds. Flank pain, that is pain originating from tissues lateral to 
the paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_6845], will not be included.
- Musculoskeletal etiology of low back. Patients with non-musculoskeletal etiologies such as urinary 
tract infection, ovarian cysts, or influenza like illness will be excluded. The primary clinical diagnosis, 
at the conclusion of the ED visit, must be a diagnosis consistent with non-traumatic, non-radicular, 
musculoskeletal LBP.
-Patient is to be discharged home. 
- Age 18-69 Enrollment will be limited to adults younger than 70 years because of the increased risk of 
adverse medication effects in the elderly.
-Non-radicular pain. Patients will be excluded if the pain radiates below the gluteal folds in a radicular 
pattern. 
-Pain duration <2 weeks (336 hours). Patients with more than two weeks of pain are at increased risk 
of poor pain and functional outcomes.(10)
-Prior to the acute attack of LBP, back pain cannot occur more frequently than once per month. 
Patients with more frequent back pain are at increased risk of poor pain and functional outcomes.(10) 
-Non-traumatic LBP: no substantial and direct trauma to the back within the previous month
-Functionally impairing back pain: A baseline score of > 5 on the Roland-Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (Appendix)
Exclusion criteria:
-Not available for follow-up
-Pregnant 
-Chronic pain syndrome defined as use of any analgesic medication on a daily or near-daily basis
-Allergic to or intolerant of investigational medications
-Contra-indications to investigational medications: 1) known peptic ulcer disease, chronic dyspepsia, 
or history of gastrointestinal bleed 2) Severe heart failure (NYHA 2 or worse) 3) Chronic kidney 
disease (GFR <60ml/min) 4) Current use of anti-coagulants 5) cirrhosis (Child Pugh A or worse) or 
hepatitis (transaminases 2x the upper limit of normal)
Investigational medication.
A. The acetaminophen arm: Ibuprofen 600mg+ acetaminophen 500-1000mg, orally, every 6 hours
B. The placebo arm: Ibuprofen 600mg+ placebo, orally, every 6 hours

Ibuprofen plus/ minus APAP. randomized trial Version 07182018 4In an effort to maximize effectiveness while minimizing side effects, patients will be instructed to 
take one ibuprofen plus one or two acetaminophen capsules every 6 hours. If one capsule of the 
acetaminophen affords sufficient relief then there will be no need for the patient to take the second 
acetaminophen capsule. However, if the patient has not experienced sufficient relief within 60 
minutes of taking one of the acetaminophen/ placebo capsules, they will be instructed to take the 
second capsule. All study patients will be given a seven day supply of ibuprofen and the 
acetaminophen. 
Outcome measures.
1. Roland Morris LBP Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)--Reproduced in the Appendix. This 24-item 
LBP functional scale is recommended for use in LBP research.(11) Its yes/ no format is amenable to 
telephone follow-up. We have used it successfully to obtain post-ED follow-up in five previous LBP 
studies involving more than 1500 patients.
2. Ordinal pain scale (“severe”, “moderate”, “mild”, or “none”). Study participants will be asked to 
describe their worst back pain in the previous 24 hours.
3. Medication requirements: “What medications did you use to treat your low back pain in the previous 
24 hours?” 
4. Low back pain frequency: “Over the last 24 hours, how often were you in pain?  Not at all, Rarely, 
Sometimes, Usually, Always”.  Low back pain symptomatology is quite variable. Some patients may 
experience no pain unless they move a certain way. Others may experience a constant low level of 
pain. This question will help determine the burdensomeness of the LBP in the patient’s daily life.
5. Satisfaction, as measured by [CONTACT_6857]: The next time you go to the ER with low 
back pain, do you want to get the same combination of medications?
Primary outcome
The change in Roland Morris Disability scale between the baseline ED visit and the one week follow-
up (Roland-Morris baseline  - Roland-Morris 1week ). The baseline questions will refer to the time period 
immediately prior to ED presentation (Before you came to the ER today, were you able to…..)..
Secondary outcomes
   The following outcomes will be assessed 48 hours and one week after ED discharge:
1. Worst LBP over the previous 24 hours, using a four point ordinal scale: severe, moderate, mild, 
or none
2. Frequency of low back pain using the five point Likert scale: Not at all, Rarely, Sometimes, 
Usually, Always
3. Use of any analgesic or LBP medication within the previous [ADDRESS_1277353] ED discharge able to return to all usual activities
6. Number of visits to any healthcare provider.
7. Satisfaction with treatment 
8. Frequency of adverse events including 
-GI side effects (dyspepsia, nausea, and bleeding)
-All other side effects

Ibuprofen plus/ minus APAP. randomized trial Version [ADDRESS_1277354] will perform randomization in blocks of 4 based on a sequence generated at 
http://randomization.com.  Ibuprofen will not be masked. Acetaminophen and placebo will be masked 
by [CONTACT_909948], which will be packed with scant amounts of lactose and 
sealed. This masking will take place in a secure location inaccessible to ED personnel. Patients will be 
presented with two bottles of medication tablets. The bottle containing the ibuprofen will be labeled in 
a typi[INVESTIGATOR_324615]. The second vial, containing acetaminophen or placebo will be labeled as 
investigational medication. 
Details of protocol
Prior to discharge from the ED and after the patient’s pain has been controlled, the healthcare provider 
will refer appropriate patients to study personnel for screening. Research associates will ascertain 
baseline socio-demographic information, low back pain history, and baseline variables discussed 
above. A urine pregnancy test will be performed. Research personnel will provide each patient with a 
15-minute educational intervention. This will be based on NIAMS’s Handout on Health: Back Pain 
information webpage (available at http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Back_Pain/default.asp) 
Research personnel will review each section of the information sheet with the patient and elicit 
questions. Patients will be discharged with two medication vials, one containing ibuprofen and one 
containing acetaminophen or placebo. Patients will be cautioned not to take off protocol LBP 
medications without first consulting with a healthcare provider. Patients will be cautioned not to drink 
alcohol while using study medications. Patients will be encouraged to follow-up with their primary 
care physician. Follow-up phone calls will be conducted [ADDRESS_1277355], express courier or 
home visit will be used to obtain follow-up information.
Analysis
An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed among all patients for whom primary outcome data is 
available. The primary outcome will be a comparison of the change in RMDQ between baseline and 
one week. The mean difference between groups will be reported with 95%CI—if this 95%CI does not 
cross zero, the result will be considered statistically significant. For patients with missing 7 day follow-
up data, we will perform two sensitivity analyses in which we assume universally good outcomes 
among all patients with missing data in one arm and universally bad arms among those with missing 
data in the other; we will the reverse these assumptions. Secondary outcomes will be reported as rates 
with 95%CI. The between group difference will be reported with 95%CI. A per protocol efficacy 
analysis will be conducted among those patients who use the investigational medication at least once.
Sample size calculation
We based assumptions on a recently completed RCT of LBP treatment.(3) The mean improvement in 
RMDQ among those who receive an NSAID alone was 10.2. The standard deviation was 8.9. A widely 
accepted minimum clinically important improvement of [ADDRESS_1277356]-to-follow-up (typi[INVESTIGATOR_6847]-to-follow-up rate is 5%) and 
to ensure sufficient power for the per protocol analysis (in our previous ED-based LBP studies, up to 
1/[ADDRESS_1277357] not used the medication more than once), we intend to enroll 60 patients 
in each arm (total n= 120)

will not be an interim analysis.
Consent
Study personnel will obtain informed consent once the patient’s pain has been controlled and the 
patient is ready for discharge from the ED. The attending physician will assess the patient’s capacity to 
consent to participate in this study. 
Risks/Benefits
NSAIDs and acetaminophen are commonly used in more than 2.[ADDRESS_1277358] part, these are minor 
events. Acetaminophen is generally well tolerated but can cause liver toxicity if used in excess. Non-
steroidals can cause life-threating gastro-intestinal bleeding, but this is unlikely in patients screened for 
gastro-intestinal illness who will take the medication for one week only. Non-steroidals increase 
cardiovascular and and risk of renal injury and may worsen blood pressure control
Data Storage & Confidentiality
Data will be stored and maintained in REDCap. Data analysis will occur on password-protected 
computers. Consent documents will be maintained in locked research cabinets. Only study personnel 
will have access to the data and consent documents.

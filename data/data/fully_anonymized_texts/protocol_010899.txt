 6. DEVICE  
6.1 Device Description  
Cheetah Medical’s Noninvasive Starling SV is a portable, non- invasive, c ardiac output detector 
system. The Starling SV  system measures the c ardiac output by [CONTACT_137302]. Bioreactance is a measure of the electrical characteristics of a volume of tissue and 
fluid. In the case of c ardiac output measurements, the relevant tissue includes the heart and the 
immediate surrounding volume of the thorax. The relevant fluid is blood. 
 Cheetah Medical's Starling SV  electrode is a double electrode sensor. Within each s ensor , one 
electrode is used to transmit a high frequency sine wave into the body, while the resulting  voltage is measured at the adjacent electrode. Four  electrodes are  
placed at specific areas of the thorax, the impedance to the current flow calculated, and  
the electrical bio reactance waveform constructed .  This information is used to determine cardiac 
output.  The Starling SV device also measures and displays associated hemodynamic parameters 
based on calculations of measurements alr eady incorporated into the Starling SV device.  These 
parameters are: Cardiac Index (CI), Ventricular Ejection Time (VET), Total Peripheral Resistance Index (TPRI), Stroke Volume Index (SVI), Stroke Volume Variation (SVV), Cardiac Power (CP), Cardiac Power Index (CPI) and Thoracic Fluid Content (TFC). Fluid responsiveness is indicated by a change in SV of > +10% in response to a fluid challenge.

6.2 Device Accountability  
The Starling SV  system (monitor and electrode disposables) will be supplied by [CONTACT_137303].    
6.3 Device Indication for Use 
The Starling SV with NIBP and SpO2 functionalities is a portable, hemodynamic monitoring 
non-invasive Cardiac Output monitoring device that monitors and displays a patient’s Cardiac Output (CO) in Ltr/Min with a Non Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP) function that non-invasively measures and displays blood pressure (diastolic, systolic and mean arterial pressure) and heart rate and with a SpO2 function that non-invasively measures and displays blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).  The device displays associated hemodynamic parameters based on measurements or calculations of measurements already incorporated into the Starling SV.  These parameters are:  
• Cardiac Index (CI),  
• Stroke Volume (SV),  • Stroke Volume Index (SVI),   • Stroke Volume Variation (SVV),  • Heart Rate (HR),  
• Ventricular Ejection Time (VET),  
• Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR),  
• Total Peripheral Resistance Index (TPRI),   
• Cardiac Power (CP),  
• Cardiac Power Index (CPI),   • Blood Oxygenation (SPO2) • Oxygen Delivery Index (DO2I),

 • Electrical impedance of the chest cavity (Z0),  
• Thoracic Fluid Content (TFC),  
• Thoracic Fluid Content change from preset time period (TFCd) and  
• Thoracic Fluid Content from baseline (TFCd0).   • Changes in SV, CO and other hemodynamic parameters which are derived by 
[CONTACT_137304]® as a result of posture  
 The Starling SV with NIBP and SpO2 functionalities is intended for use within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137286] (e.g., outpatient clinics) that provide patient care).  
 
6.4 Device Procedure(s)/ Training  
All sites will receive  device training on the Cheetah Starling SV system prior to study initiation.  
 6.5 Fluid  Assessment -Passive Leg Raise (PLR) 
The passive leg raise (PLR) shall  be followed according to the following guidelines: 
• Select PLR Test from main menu on Starling SV  system  
• With patient in s emi-recumbent position (30 -45°), obtain three minutes of monitoring for 
average baseline SVI  
• With patient legs raised to 45 degree angle, obtain three minutes of monitoring for peak 
SVI value  
• Fluid responsiveness is indicated by a Δ  SVI ≥  +10%

Training on study protocol requirements will be provided for the entire study team at the 
initiation of the study.  It is ultimately the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all clinical site personnel participating in this study are adequately trained.  
 To ensure uniform data collection and protocol compliance, Cheetah Medical and/or designee will perform study initiation visits to review the clinical protocol, techniques for the identification of eligible subjects, instructions on in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137291], and methods for 
soliciting data from alternative sources.  
 11.2.[ADDRESS_155889] review of the current trial.  The Sponsor may provide needed assistance in responding to regulatory audits.   
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
12.1  Sample Size Estimation  
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:[ADDRESS_155890] of care. The primary effectiveness endpoint for this study is the difference between the two treatment groups in mean  fluid balance at ICU dischar ge. 
 Minimum enrollment (N
min) in the study will be set at 120 subjects (80 Starling SV and 40 
control) to power at 80% for possible demonstration of superiority for the secondary endpoint of creatinine levels as a measurement of change from baseline. The secondary endpoint for change in creatinine levels at 120 evaluable subjects displays 80% power at a two -sided alpha level of 

Page 23 of 34 
 
Cheetah Medical –Evaluation of fluid volume in patients with sepsis and refractory hypotension  Clinical Protocol  
  Rev. H 
 0.[ADDRESS_155891] of -1.4 mg/dL with a 
standard deviation of 2.5 mg/dL.  Under an assumption of a treatment effect of -[ADDRESS_155892] deviation of 3 L, the sample size of 120 evaluable subjects provides 92.7% power in a test of superiority for the primary effectiveness endpoint.  The trial will incorporate a sample size re -estimation (SSR) at the time of the interim look based 
on promise for superiority in the key secondary endpoint. Methods for the SSR have been described in detail in previous literature. The maximum enrollment being considered for this trial is 210 total enrolled (N
max = 1.75 times N min). 
 An interim analysis incorporating a SSR will take place when [ADDRESS_155893] been enrolled and completed endpoint evaluations. The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_55467]. It is assumed that the acute endpoint assessments will be fully informed at the time of the interim analysis.  
 At this point, the primary study endpoint will be tested as final, and will not incorporate an alpha spend.  The conditional power to claim superiority (CP
sup) on the key secondary endpoint for change in 
creatinine levels will be computed. The conditional power (CP sup) will be calculated based on the 
interim results of the key secondary endpoint, with the specific interest of demonstrating superiority. CP
sup is defined as the approach that quantifies the statistical power to yield an 
answer different from that seen at the interim analysis. The data will be partitioned into three zones based on CP
sup unfavorable zone (CP sup<50%),  promising zone ( 50%≤ CPsup<80%), and 
favorable zone (CP sup≥80%).  
 
12.[ADDRESS_155894] will be exited from the study.  Adverse events will be reported for all enrolled subjects through the time of study exit.  
 12.2.2 Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  
The intent- to-treat population (ITT) will consist of any subjects that have signed the ICF, me et 
study eligibility criteria,  and are randomized to the treatment or control arm of the study.   
 12.2.3 Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT)  
Subjects will be included in the Modified Intent- to-Treat group if they sign the ICF, meet study 
eligibility criteria, are ran domized, and in the treatment group receive monitoring for the first  [ADDRESS_155895]. The mITT population represents the Primary  and Secondary  Analysis population for this study. 
 

Page 24 of 34 
 
Cheetah Medical –Evaluation of fluid volume in patients with sepsis and refractory hypotension  Clinical Protocol  
  Rev. H 
 12.2.4 Per- Protocol (PP)  
Subjects will be included in the Per-protocol group if they sign the ICF, are randomized and have 
the assigned procedure completed, meet critical study eligibility criteria and have no major pr otocol 
deviations (defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan),  and, in the treatment group, receive 
monitoring for the first 72 hours of study enrollment. The PP population represents a subgroup analysis population for this study.   
12.3 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary endpoint is an evaluation of the difference  between the two treatment groups in  
mean fluid balance (L) at  [ADDRESS_155896]. The following 
hypothesis will be tested:  
 
Ho: μc - μT = 0 
Ha: μc  - μT ≠ [ADDRESS_155897] deviation, as well as 95% confidence intervals. A t- test for superiority at a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_155898] the hypothesis that μt is significantly less than μc. If it can be established that the difference 
is greater than 0 points (i.e. μC > μT), superiority will also be claimed.  12.[ADDRESS_155899] significant. The endpoints will then be tested in order at adjusted levels of significance (i.e. E1: 0.05/k, E2: 0.05/k-1; E3: 0.05/k-2, where k=numbe r of specified 
endpoints). Once an endpoint fails, all following endpoints will not be tested. Following is a list of key secondary endpoints:  Following is a list of key secondary endpoints for formal testing:  
• Length of ICU stay (days) until subject is medically ready for discharge  
• Number of days free from ventilator  use (30 day period)  
• Requirement for mechanical ventilation  
• Number of days free from  vasopressor use  
• Changes in serum creatinine levels from baseline  
• Requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT)  
 Additional secondary endpoint have also been identified for testing, but will not be included in the formal statistical testing procedures for key secondary endpoints:  
• Incidence of Adverse Events (AE)  

Page 25 of 34 
 
Cheetah Medical –Evaluation of fluid volume in patients with sepsis and refractory hypotension  Clinical Protocol  
  Rev. H 
 • Number of ICU readmissions  
• Mortality rate  
• Mean volume of treatment fluid  
• Incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) 
• Discharge location  
• Mean difference in fluid balance at ICU discharge  
 
 
Additional sub-analyses have been planned for the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Primary and secondary endpoints will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_137310]:  
• Patient disease state  
• Patients determined to be fluid responsive vs non-fluid responsive  
• AKI measures in patients determined to increase serum creatinine levels from baseline vs decrease serum creatinine levels from baseline  
• Enrollment time frame  
 
12.[ADDRESS_155900] demographics, clinical history, risk factors, and pre- procedure 
patient characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum and maximum) for continuous variables  and frequency tables or percentages for categorical variables.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_155901] Accountability and Missing Data  
Subjects enrolled in this study are followed for a short  time period , and missing data in this study 
is expected to occur at a low rate.  All efforts w ill be used to prevent missing data.  These efforts 
include, but are not limited to, complete site training and regular monitoring to help to minimize missing data.  
 Subjects without the minimum amo unt of monitoring [i.e. throughout first 72 hours of study 
enrollment,] and measurements specified in the protocol will be considered as missing in the final analysis.  The impact of missing data on the study will be evaluated via sensitivity analyses if more than 5% of subjects do not have evaluable data for the primary outcome.  In the final report, the number and proportion of subjects eligible for and compliant with each analysis population will be presented.

2 (100)VERSION HISTORY
Global Clinical Study Protocol Version 8.0 is arising from:
Outsi de of  US Clinical Study  Protocol  version 7.0 (Outside of US )
US (only) Clinical Study Protocol versio n 7.0 ( US)
Clinical Study Protocol version 8.0
Rationale for protocol amendment:
Changes were made to clarify  operati onal and statisti cal aspects of the protocol, including 
minor editori al changes throughout the document to c orrect ty pographical errors and improve 
consistency and clarit y.
Changes to secondary  efficacy in term s of addit ion of objectives and outcome measures as 
well as the ordering were made to harmonize D5740C00002 with the other phase 3 trials in 
the Roxadusta t dialysis program  (FG-4592 -064, 1517- CL-0613 and FG-4592- 063).
Adjudicated CV events from this study  will be part of the pool ed anal ysis across the study  
program. This strategy  was adopted to ensure that the overall number of events is high enough 
to prov ide adequate power to address CV No harm. Thus, all analyses of CV safet y will be 
conducted in accordance with the Pooled SAP (PSAP) .
Summary of changes from Clinical Study Protocol version 7.0 (US) and Clinical Study 
Protocol version 7.0 ( Outside of US) to version 8.0:
All below changes are updated in relevant sections of the study protocol.
General changes throughout the document:
Estimated date of study  com pletion changed throughout the ent ire docum ent to Q3 2018.
Rationale for change: Revisio n and cl arificat ion of estimated date of study  com pletion.
Synopsis and Section 2.1. Primary safety objectives
The previous texts on primary  object ive is moved to the sect ion on primary safet y objective.
New texts stating that pooled CV safet y analyses are now de scribed in the PSAP.
Rationale for change:
Harm onizes D5740C00002 with the other phase [ADDRESS_379451] ive and its outcome m easure s is designated for US FDA . 
Another outcome measure designated for EU health authorit y, namely, Hb change fro m 
baseline (BL) t o the average Hb of weeks 28 to 36, without having received rescue therapy 
(i.e. RBC transfusio n for all subjects and ESA for roxadustat subjects) within 6 weeks prior to

program, to serve as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_309519] y, and facilitates 
assessment of pool ed efficacy and safet y across the phase 3 program .
Synopsis and Section 2. 2
. Secondary efficacy objectives
Here are the main changes as fo llows:
1.The efficacy of roxadustat based on the change from baseline in Hb averaged over 
Week [ADDRESS_379452] ive.
2. P roporti on of  total  time of Hb ≥10 g/dL from  week 28 to week 52”, is added as a new 
outcom e measure for the secondary  efficacy objective based on Hb response and level 
during the study .
3.The secondary  efficacy object ive with itsoutcom e measure rel ated to com posite 
rescue -therapy  isreplaced by a corresponding objective related to RBC transfusio n.
Proporti on and number of subjects receiving RBC transfusio n as rescue therapy  are 
also reported . 
4.The secondary  efficacy object ive with itsoutcom e measure rel ated to self-reported 
healt h status using EQ -5D-5L is removed
5.Addit ional secondary  efficacy object ives with their outcome measures related to LDL 
cholesterol  and IV i ron are added. 
Rationale for change : 
To harm onize wi th the secondary object ives of the other phase 3 studies in the pro gram .
Synopsis and Section 2.2. Secondary safety objectives
Two CV safety  related secondary  safet y objectives are removed. 
Rationale for change:
They  are to be addressed in the pooled analyses across the phase 3 program according to the 
PSAP .
Synopsis and Section 8.2 Sample size estimate
The description of the determinat ion of the sample size related to CV safet y has been 
shortened.
Rationale for change:
Reference to a more detailed descript ion of the requirements for sample size to address CV 
safet y for this indicati on is made to the pooled statistical analysis plan.

12 (100)Inclusion Criteria
Added text to modify Inclusio n Cri teria # 3, specifically it now reads as fo llows (added text i s 
italicized):
Receiving or initiating hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for treatment of native kidney end -
stage renal disease (ESRD ) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_379466] access consisting of an 
arteriovenous fistula, AV graft, or tunneled (permanent) catheter. Patients on peritoneal 
dialysis must have a functioning peritoneal dialysis catheter in place .
Rationale for change:
Study  D5740C00002 (Rockies) was designed to allow for both incident and stable dial ysis 
patients to be enrolled. The incident dia lysis populati on is recogni zed to have higher
cardi ovascular event rates, higher mortalit yrates, and higher ESA dose requirement for 
anemia therap y. Because the stable dialy sis (conversi on) pati ents were enrolled at a much 
more rapi d rate in thi s phase [ADDRESS_379467] risk, 2 wks to 4 mo nths, is captured.
Dose and treatment regimens 
Initial dosing of Roxadustat an d Epoeti n Alfa will be based upon current dose at screening 
visit 1 for patients already  receiving ery thropoi etin analogue therapy.
Rationale for change:
Incident dialysis pat ients frequent ly are on ti trated dosing of ESA and this change simplifies 
the initial dosing strategy .
Dose and schedule and Dosing of epoetin alfa (active control)
Deleted paragraphs covering self -administrati on.
Rationale for change:
Acco mmo date si tes where pati ents are dialyzed at hours when site staff cannot be present.

Removed and replaced by  a ref erence to the document.
Rationale for amendment:
Study  D5740 C00002 was designed to allow for both incident and stable dialy sis pat ients to 
be enrolled. The incident dia lysis populati on is recogni zed to have higher cardi ovascular
event rates, higher mortalit yrates, and higher ESA dose requirement for anemia therap y. 
Because the stable dial ysis (conversio n) pati ents were enrolled at a much more rapi d rate in 
this phase 3 program than incident dial ysis pat ients, there were few incident dial ysis 
patients enrolled when the original target for this study was reached. The primary intent is 
to further support the enro lment of incident dial ysis pati ents to improve representation o f 
incident dia lysispatients for the pooled analy sis in the roxadustat phase 3 program. 
The incidence dialysis patient populat ion is an important subset of the intended pat ient 
popul ation for the roxadustat Phase 3 dialysis studies; including these pat ients will help 
evaluate the safet y and efficacy of roxadustat in all dialysis pat ients.
The primary  purpose of thi s protocol  amendment is harmo nization of  D5740C00002 with the 
other phase 3 trials in the roxadustat dialysis program, allowing the program to demonstrate 
both efficacy and safet y across popul ations studied. Addit ionally , the amendment allows 
further recruit ment of newly  initiated (incide nt) dialysis patients (on dialysis ≥2 weeks but ≤4 
months at randomizat ion).

(CTCAE) versio n 4.0 has been removed and replaced by a reference to the 
docum ent.
Rationale for amendme nt:
Rockies was designed to allow for both incident and stable dialysis pat ients to be enrolled. 
The incident dialysis populat ion is recognized to have higher cardiovascular event rates, 
higher mortalit y rates, and higher ESA dose requirement for anemia th erapy . Because the 
stable dialysis (conversio n) patients were enrolled at a much more rapid rate in this phase 3 
program than incident dialysis pat ients, there were few incident dialysis pat ients enro lled, 
especially  incident di alysis pat ients from the US, when the original target for this study  was 
reached. The primary  intent for thi s US -only amendment is to further support the enrolment 
of US incident dialysis patients to improve representation of incident dialysis pat ients in the 
US for the pooled analy sis in the roxadustat phase 3 program.

Summary of main changes from edition  3.0 to 4.0:
Concomitant medications
Deleted text `Due to a potential…at the healt hcare provi ders discretion`
Added text to new section Statins [IP_ADDRESS]
`When co administered with roxadustat, hy droxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase 
inhibitor (statin) exposure was increased [ADDRESS_379471] ion. Goals of lipid lowering treatment 
shoul d be maintained as clinically indicated. The recommend ed m aximum  daily statin doses 
are: simvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 
40 m g (20 m g if eGFR<30), pi [INVESTIGATOR_2830] 2 mg (1 mg if eGFR<30)
Rationale :
In vitro studies indicated an inhibitory  potential  of roxadustat for transporters OATP1B1 and 
BCRP, so formal drug: drug interaction studies with simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin 
were conducted. When preliminary results became available, the Clinical Study  Protocol  
concomitant medicat ion sect ion was up dated:
simvastatin 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC
atorvastatin 1.3-fold increase in Cmax, 2 -fold increase in AUC
rosuvastatin 4-fold increase in Cmax, 3 -fold increase in AUC
The CSP al ready  included maximum recommended statin doses based on in vitro data ; 
rosuvastatin exposure when administered with roxadustat was higher than predicted, so the 
maximum reco mmended rosuvastatin dose was reduced from [ADDRESS_379472] ion in the context of local prescribing informat ion and lipid 
guidelines. Reco mmendat ions for pravastatin, pi[INVESTIGATOR_309520].

16 (100)[IP_ADDRESS] Phosphate binders
When coadministered with phosphate binders, roxadustat exposure was reduced. Patients should be 
advised to discuss with the investigator before changing their phosph ate binder dose or dosing time. To 
optimize absorption of roxadustat, subjects should take roxadustat at least 1 hour before or 3 hours 
after their phosphate binder.
Rationale :
In addition to new statin data, preliminary results of a drug: drug interactio n study with sevelamer 
carbonate and calcium acetate indicate 40 -50% reduced roxadustat exposure with concurrent
administration. A recommendation to take roxadustat at least 1 hour before or 3 hours after phosphate 
binder was also added to the concomitant medication section.
Concomitant medications
Moved herbal medicine text “ Use of herbal medicine…to continue at the same dose” fro m 
7.7.1 to a new section [IP_ADDRESS] Herbal medicine
Rationale :
In addit ion, preliminary results of a drug: drug interaction stu dy with sevelamer carbonate and 
calcium acetate indicate 40 -50% reduced roxadustat exposure with concurrent administration. 
A reco mmendat ion to take roxadustat at least 1 hour before or 3 hours after phosphate binder 
was also added to the concomitant medic ation sectio n.

algorithms for Correction and Maintenance
Maximum dose reduced fro m lower of 3.5 m g/kg or 400 m g to 3.0 m g/kg or 400 m g
Rationale:
Dosing simplified to reduce risk of prescriber/pat ient error and provide slow, steady  Hb ri se to 
and maintenance wit hin desired range of 11+1 g/dL. 
Dose algorithm was adjusted to reflect results of pharmaco metric modeling and simulation 
using the simplified dosing regimen

Study design
This is a Phase 3, mult icenter, randomized, open -label, active -controlled study  to eval uate the 
efficacy  and safety  of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia in dialysis 
patients. Pati ents on hem odialysis (HD) o r peritoneal dialysis (PD) who have been treated with 
an ery thropoi etin analogue or have an indicat ion for treatm ent wi th an ery thropoi etin analogue 
will be evaluated for eligibilit y and rando mized at a 1:1 ratio to treatment with roxadustat (with 
disconti nuation of prior ery thropoi etin analogue therapy) or to an active -control  group treated 
with epoetin alfa.

and laboratory  values.
Target subject population
Approxi mately 2000 anemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis 
or peri toneal dialysis wit h an indicat ion for treatment with an ery thropoi etin analogue.
Duration of treatment
The study  will consist of three study  periods as follows:
 Screening Period: Up to 6 weeks
 Treatment Period: Patients will be rando mized (1:1) to open- label treatm ent wi th 
either roxadustat or epoetin alfa. A study  end date will be declared and commo n close -
out will occur when the target number of CV events has been accrued. The expected 
durati on of  treatm ent is est imated to be up to 4years
 Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period : [ADDRESS_379481] , dosage and mode of administration
Roxadustat
Roxadustat will be administered orally  three times a week (TIW). St udy drug doses must be 
administered at least 2 days apart but no more than 4 days apart (e.g., Monday , Wednesday, 
Friday). Sel ection of roxadustat starting dose will utilize a conversion table (Section 7) for 
patients currently treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue. Patients not currently treated with an 
erythropoi etin analogue will init iate roxadusta t using a tiered weight -based dosing scheme. 
Patients wi th dry weights between [ADDRESS_379482] ments are permitted starting at week 4 and at intervals of every  
4weeks thereafter in order to achieve an Hb le vel of 11 g/dL and maintain an Hb o f 11±1 g/ dL. 
However, dose adjust ments can be done at any t ime if dose reduction is required for excessive 
erythropoi esis. Study  drug will be dosed TIW throughout the study  treatm ent peri od unl ess 
downward dose adjust ment requi res a change to twice or once weekly.
Epoetin alfa 
Initial dose select ion of epoetin alfa for patients treated with an eryt hropoiet in analogue will be 
determined using a conversio n table based on the patient’s current ery thropoi etin analogue dose

erythropoi etin at study  entry  will be 50 IU/kg TIW with subsequent dose adjust ments to achieve 
an Hb l evel of 11 g/dL and maintain an Hb o f 11±1 g/dL, consistent with approved prescribing 
inform ation or the Summary  of Product Characteristics for epoetin alfa.
Rescue therapy  guidelines are provi ded to optimize standardizat ion of the use of rescue therapy  
by [CONTACT_309547] y of the individual  study patients.
In the event of excessive erythropoi esis, the dose may be adjusted or put on hold at any  time.
Statistical methods
Sample size determination
Primary efficacy variable: With at least [ADDRESS_379483] 99% power 
to demo nstrate non -inferiorit y of roxadustat versus epoetin alfa for the primary efficacy  endpoint 
(i.e., Hb change fro m baseline to the average level during the evaluat ion peri od defined as Week 
28 until Week 52). This assumes a difference (roxadustat minus epoe tin alfa) of -0.30 g/dL, a 
non-inferiorit y margin for this difference of -0.75 g/dL and a standard deviat ion of 1.25 g/dL.
To contribute adjudicated CV events for the pooled CV analyses across the phase 3 program: 
approximately  2000 subjects will be random ized in a 1:1 ratio to either roxadustat or active 
control , i.e. epoetin alfa. The sample size for this study  is driven by  [CONTACT_309548] 3 program in dialysis -treated CKD subjects (which consists 
of four stu dies in total targeting 611 subjects with MA CE events ).The three other studies in the 
study  program  are FG -[ADDRESS_379484] an and the pooled statistical analysis plan.

35(100)1. I NTRODUCTION
1.[ADDRESS_379496] igational novel  drug in devel opment f or the 
treatm ent of anemia associated with chronic kidney  disease (CKD), including end -stage renal 
disease (ESRD) . It is current ly in glo bal Ph ase 3 clinical development and has not been 
marketed in any country . Roxadustat i s a potent and reversible orally  active hypoxia -inducible 
factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF -PHI) that transient ly induces hypoxia -inducible factor 
(HIF) stabilizat ion and leads to a funct ional HIF transcript ional response that mimics the 
erythropoi etic response associated with exposure of humans to intermittent hy poxia 
(Semenza 1998
). HIF induces expressio n not only of erythropoi etin, but al so the
erythropoi etinreceptor and proteins that promote iron reabsorption and recy cling 
(Peyssonnaux et al  2008 ). Thus, roxadustat pharmacologically st imulates ery thropoi esis via 
the HIF pathway  and in a manner consistent with the body ’s norm al homeostati c response to 
hypoxia, but under normoxic condit ions. Potential advantages of roxadustat compared with 
erythropoi etin analogues for treatment of anemia in patients with CKD treated with dialysis 
include oral administrati on, greater cardiovascular (CV) safet y and reduced need for 
intravenous (IV) iron therapy . The clinical  data collected thus far suggest that roxadustat is 
generally safe and well tolerated in healt hy adult patients, and in dialysis and no n-dialysis 
CKD pati ents wi th anemia treated up to 60 weeks. Informat ion from the clinical studies 
conducted with roxadustat can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The obj ective o f the current study  is to assess the efficacy ,safet y and tol erabili ty,with the 
primary  focus on Hem oglobin efficacy and CVsafety of roxadustat in pat ients with ESRD 
treated by  [CONTACT_2900] (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]).
1.[ADDRESS_379497] an indicat ion 
for treatm ent w ith an ery thropoietin analogue.
1.2.2 Rationale for doses 
Starti ng doses of roxadustat were studied in three ways in the Phase 2 program : mg per kg 
weight
-based dosing, tiered weight -based dosing or a fixed starting dose regardless of weight.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Roxadustat
Study Code D5740C00002
Version 8.0
Date 19September 2018
36(100)Dose adjust ments were allowed at regular 4 -week intervals to maintain, increase or decrease 
the dose according to pre -specified rules. Addit ional rules were provi ded to minimize 
excessive erythropoi esis. These dose adj ustm ent rules are adopted in this study  with minor 
modificati ons. 
For pati ents treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue at study entry, selection o f initial 
roxadustat dose in this study  will utilize a conversion table based on the patient’s current 
erythropoi etin analogue dose at screening visit 1 . Pati ents not currently  treated wi th 
erythropoi etin analogue will init iate roxadustat using a tiered weight -based dose dosing 
scheme. Patients with dry weights between 45 and 70 kg will receive 70 mg of roxadustat as 
starting dose.  Patients with dry  weights between 71 and 160 kg will receive 100 mg of 
roxadustat for init ial dosing.
Doses will be administered at a frequency o f three times a week (TIW) throughout the study  
treatm ent peri od unless downward dose adjust ment requires a change to twice or once weekly.
In the event of excessive erythropoi esis, the dose may be adjusted at any  time. The maximum 
dose of roxadustat allowed will be the lower of 3.0 mg/kg or [ADDRESS_379498] ice 
guidelines and approved prescribing inform ation for epoetin alfa. The init ial dose of epoetin 
alfa will be selected based on the ery thropoi etin anal ogue regimen used prior to the entry  into 
the study .  Pati ents who were not receiving an ery thropoi etin analogue at study  entry  will 
initially receive epoetin alfa at a dose of 50 IU/kg three times weekly .  Adjustments in the 
total weekly  dose or frequency of epoetin alfa dosing should subsequently be made to achieve 
an Hb of 11 g/dL and maintain Hb levels of 11±1 g/dL.
1.2.3 Rationale for control group
The c ontrol  group will be treated with epoetin alfa in accordance wit h accepted clinical 
practi ce guidelines and approved prescribing informat ion for epoetin alfa in this patient 
popul ation. Epoetin alfa is a frequent ly used eryt hropoiet in analogue agent and is approved for 
use in treatment of anemia associ ated wi th CKD in dialysis pat ients. 
1.2.4 Rationale for hemoglobin level
This study  seeks to achieve and m aintain Hb wi thin the range of 11±1 g/dL. This level is 
chosen to improve the clinical manifestations of anemia, reduce RBC transfusio n and improve 
qualit y of life, wi thout affect ing CV risk. Systematic reviews have found that anemia
correcti on in patients with CKD improved exercise tolerance, energy  and physical  functions 
(Gandra et al 2010, Johansen et al 2010 ). Also, a number of studies and meta analyses have
addressed the issue of clinical benefit versus potential risk upon anemia correcti on in CKD 
(Phrommint ikul et al 2010, Strippo li et al 2004). In a recent update, the [ADDRESS_379499] that ery thropoi etin analogues be started at Hb below 10 g/dL and should 
generally not be used to maintain Hb above 11.5 g/dL ( Johansen et al 2010 , KDIGO 2012 ). In 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 19September 2018
37(100)contrast, the Cleveland Clinic reco mmends target hemoglo binlevel  for both predi alysis CKD 
and ESRD patie nts should be 11 to 12 g/dL ( Lascano et al 2010 ).
Unlike Hb levels above 13 g/dL where the data indicates CV harm ( Pfeffer et al  2009 ), there 
is a paucit y of data on the po tential risk of CV adverse events when Hb below 12 g/dL i s 
achieved. Further, other factors than the exact Hb level may contribute to t he CV risk 
associ ated wi th erythropoi etin analogue use. These include toxic effects of higher doses of 
erythropoi etin ana logue ( Andrews et al201) and a too rapid increase in hemoglo binupon 
anemia correcti on (Singh 2010).
Roxadustat acts via a different mechanism of act ion than ery thropoi etin analogues and supra -
physio logic ery thropoi etin concentrations have not been observed in pat ients treated with 
roxadustat ( Yu et al 2013). Wi th the proposed dosing regimen, the risk of rapid rises of Hb 
levels is minimized. Finally, in clinical pract ice, it is difficul t to m aintain individual patient 
Hb values wit hin a very  narrow range and the p roposed range (11±1 g/dL) is in line with 
achievable levels in practice.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
The primary  benefit for patients rando mized to roxadustat is expected to be the correction of 
anemia, including the relief o f associated si gns and symptom s and an improved qualit y of life. 
Roxadustat is expected to be at least as safe as parenteral ery thropoi etin anal ogues.
An established dose adjust ment algorithm will be used during the study  to titrate roxadustat 
doses to enable pat ients to achieve and maintain Hb levels, while closely mo nitoring the rate 
of rise of Hb levels. Roxadustat doses may be held and therape utic phlebotomy  is allowed in 
the event of excessive erythropoi esis. 
Dosing o f epoetin alfa in the epoetin alfa group will be consistent with approved prescribing 
inform ation. Adverse and serious adverse events, and laboratory  parameters including 
electro lytes, liver enzymes, and iron indices, will be closely mo nitored to ensure the safet y of 
treatm ent wi th roxadustat or epoetin alfa. 
In studies with healt hy subjects, headache and dizziness were commo n events which occurred 
at a hi gher frequency wit h roxa dustat compared to placebo. An increased frequency of mild to 
moderate m uscul oskeletal  pain was also noted with high doses of roxadustat. These findings 
were not observed at the usual therapeut ic dose range in the Phase [ADDRESS_379500] 
pronounced at supra -therapeuti c doses (5 m g/kg). At the high clinical dose of 2.75 mg/kg, the 
increase was modest (about 10 bpm fro m baseline, placebo corrected). In the Phase [ADDRESS_379501] not ident ified any major risks 
related to roxadustat, which was well tolerated by  [CONTACT_309550].

38(100)The safet y of treatm ent wi th roxadustat and epoeti n alfa will be carefully mo nitored and an 
independent Data Safety  Moni toring Board (DSMB) will perform periodic assessments of 
safet y data to detect any  potential  safety signals that m ay arise during the study  and advise the 
International Coordinat ing Investigator and Sponsor accordingly. 
Based on data so far obtained, treatment with roxadustat is expected to be efficacious in 
treating anemia in patients with CKD. The safet yprofile of the co mpound, together with the 
safet y monitoring implemented would minimize the risk to study  parti cipants. The benefit -risk 
in this study  is therefore deem ed acceptable.

1.4 Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, mult icenter, randomiz ed, open -label, active -controlled study  to eval uate the 
efficacy and safety of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia due to 
CKD in dialysis pat ients (hemo dialysis or peri toneal  dialysis). This study  is planned to 
rando mize approximately 2000 patients from approximately 250 centers worldwide.
1.4.1 Treatment duration and dosing
The study  periods are as fo llows:
 Screening Period: Up to 6 weeks
Treatment Peri od: Patients will be rando mized (1:1) to open- label treatm ent wi th 
roxadustat or epoetin alfa. Roxadustat will be started at doses of 70 mg for patients 
with dry weights between 45 and 70 kg and 100 mg for patients with dry  weights 
between 71 and 160 kg. T his dose will be subsequent ly titrated. Pati ents currently 
treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue and randomized to receive roxadustat will 
discontinue prior ery thropoi etin analogue therapy and init iate treatm ent wi th 
roxadustat at a starting dose accordi ng to Table 4Secti on 7to achi eve and m aintain
Hb 11±1 g/dL. Epoetin alfa dosing will be done in accordance with accepted 
clinical practice guidelines and approved pres cribing informat ion.
The expected duration of treatment is est imated to be up to 4 years. A study  end 
date will be declared and commo n closeout will occur when the target number of 
CV events has been accrued.
 Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period: 4 weeks. Pati ents who di scont inue study  
medicat ion or protocol -specified study  visits will  be followed up for CV events, 
vital status and hospi [INVESTIGATOR_309523]  (EOS), unl ess consent to 
participate is withdrawn.
1.4.2 Randomization
A total o f approximate ly 2000 patients will be randomiz ed at 1:1 rati o to roxadustat or epoetin 
alfa via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)/ Interactive Voice Response System 
(IVRS).

Patients currently treated with an ery thropoi etin anal ogue who are randomized to the 
roxadustat group will discontinue prior ery thropoi etin anal ogue therapy  and ini tiate treatm ent 
with roxadustat at a starting dose according to Sectio n 7. Pati ents not currently  treated wi th an
erythropoi etin analogue will init iate roxadustat with dose selection based on body  weight. 
Roxadustat will be dosed orally three times a week (TIW) throughout the Treatm ent Peri od 
unless dose reduction is required based on Hb levels.
Epoetin alfa
Patients currently treated with ery thropoi etin analo gue who are rando mized to the epoetin alfa 
active control group will be treated with epoetin alfa dosing regimen as described in Sect ion 7
. 
Initial dosing of epoetin alfa in pat ients not currently  treated wi th erythropoi etin analogue will 
be 50 IU/kg TIW with subsequent dose adjust ments of ery thropoietin analogue made based on 
Hb levels consistent with approved prescribing information.
During the screening period, eligibilit y will be confirmed at a minimum o f 2 screening visits. 
If eligible, the patient will be randomized at the rando mizat ion visit. During the treatment 
period, pati ents will be contact[CONTACT_309551] 1, and will attend study  visits every  
two weeks from weeks 2 to 20. After week 20, study  visits will occur every  four weeks unt il 
the end of treatment period. A study  end date will be defined based on when the planned 
number of events are estimated to be accrued; the end of treatment (EOT) visit will occur as

The fo llowing restri ctions apply in the study :
Female pat ients of childbearing poten tial and m ale pati ents (non -surgi cally  sterile i .e., 
vasectomy ) with a female partner of childbearing potential must, if not practicing complete 
sexual abst inence, agree to practice a dual method of contraception, for example, a 
combinat ion of the fo llowing: (1) oral contraceptive, depo progesterone or intrauterine device; 
and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm).
Contraceptive methods must be practiced upon being rando mized to the study and through 
12weeks after the last dose of study  treatm ent. If  a pati ent di scontinues prematurely , the 
contraceptive method must be practiced for [ADDRESS_379514] be

prejudice to further treatment.
2. Invest igator’s decisio n, including but not limited to these examples:
Incorrectly randomized patient in who m the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria 
violation would put the patient at undue risk
Adverse event (AE) for which the invest igator thinks continued treatment may 
put the patient at undue risk
Severe non -compliance to study  protocol  
Pregnancy
Need for m ore than one cycle of ery thropoi etin analogue rescue in patients 
treated with Roxadustat
Patients who receive organ transplantation during the study
Each permanent discont inuat ion from study  medicati on shoul d be co mmunicated to the study 
team . For decisi ons around perm anent discont inuatio n the [COMPANY_008] study  physician can be 
consulted as appropriate. Study  assessments or fo llow-up should be cont inued in all cases if 
possible, see Section 4.
3.9.[ADDRESS_379518] 
Patients perm anent ly discontinuing study medicat ion should be given convent ional therapy, if 
applicable, and should always be asked to continue the regular study  visits as described below.
A pat ient who decides to discont inue study  medicat ion will always be asked about the 
reason(s) to discontinue study  medicat ion and the presence of AEs (if any). These data will be 
ascertained and documented by [CONTACT_309553]. AEs 
will be fo llowed up (see Secti ons 4and 6.4); and the pat ient shoul d return all study  
medicat ions.
Discontinuation from study medication is not the same as complete withdrawal from the 
study (withdraw al of consent), which has a direct impact on the potential validity of all 
study data, and should be avoided wherever possible. It is essential to collect as much 
data as possible for all patients throughout the study and especially all potential 
endpoint events.
All discont inued patients unless consent withdrawal will be fo llowed up for vi tal status and 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_309524] (see Secti on [IP_ADDRESS] ).
If the patient permanent ly discont inues study medi cation pri or to cl osure of the study , there 
shoul d be several different options for their continuation in the study  as described below:
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Roxadustat
Study Code D5740C00002
Version 8.0
Date 19September 2018
48(100)[IP_ADDRESS] Patient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discontinuation Visit and 
then continue in -person study visits
The pat ient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discont inuat ion Visit (PTDV) and 
then cont inue in-person study  visits according to plan. This is the preferred option and 
patients who discont inue study  medicat ion will always be asked if they agree to this ap proach. 
If agreed, as above, the patient will undergo their PTDV within 15 days after the study  
medicat ion is stopped. The PTDV includes the same assessments as the EOT visit. The patient 
will cont inue attending subsequent study visits according to schedul e (Table 1), or if needed 
with reduced frequency until end of study  is declared (i.e., when the prespecified number of 
primary  events has been reached). The patient will then return for their EOS visit as soon as 
feasible ,but no l ater than 60 days after the study  closure has been declared. It is essent ia
l that 
the pati ents attend the EOS visit in person whenever possible.
At PTDV, the physicians caring for the patient will decide upon treatment the patient should 
receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient refuses to continue in -person study visits but agrees to undergo 
modified follow -up
If the patient agrees, the PTDV should be done. In all subjects permanent ly discont inuing 
study  drug, all  adverse e vents and potential endpoints should be captured during the 28 days 
following study  drug di scont inuat ion. Bey ond 28 days following study  drug di scontinuat ion, 
for subjects who refuse to continue in- person study visits but agree to modified follow -up, all 
SAEs shoul d be captured as well as any  information(for exam ple, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_309525]) 
relevant to the fo llowing adj udicated events:
 Death
 Non-fatal MI
 Non-fatal stroke
 Heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
 Unstable angina leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
 Pulmo nary embo lism (PE)
 Vascular access thrombosis (VAT)
 Hypertensive emergency
Addit ionally , informat ion about anemia treatment fo llowing study  drug di scont inuat ion (for 
example, ery thropoi etin analogue use) should be documented in the eCRF.
Examples of modified fo llow
-up include in -person study  visits occurring at a different 
frequency  and/or wi th fewer study  procedures (for example, without laboratory  assessments)

subject’s treating physician; and periodic medical record review. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient refuses any form of follow -up
If the patient refuses a n
yform of follow-up, he/she official ly withdraws from  the study and 
withdraws consent. Th is approach should be avo ided if possible and is further described in 
Secti on 3.10. All available fo llow-up opti ons (including modified fo llow-up as described in 
section [IP_ADDRESS]) should be discussed with the patient, and the pa tient’s refusal o f all fo llow-up 
options shoul d be docum ented. Patients who agree to any  form of follow-up or contact [CONTACT_309554] (for exam ple, one phone call during the study  closeout peri od), have not wi thdrawn 
consent. At the end of the stud y, vital status on all  such pati ents will  be collected from  
publicly available sources, in accordance wit h local reg ulations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Restart of study medication
Whenever possible, restart of rando mized study medicat ion shoul d be encouraged. However ,
if a pat ient has perm anent ly discont inued study  drug and a PTDV has been performed, study  
drug should not be restarted.
If pat ient has been treated with ery thropoi etin analogue as rescue, see Section 7.7.4 for 
guidance on whe n study  drug treatm ent can be restarted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] End of study procedures
If a patient is unable to attend the EOS visit in person, telephone contact [CONTACT_309555], 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689], SAEs and vital status, should be made to ascertain endpoint and AE 
information. 
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
Patients are at any  time free to withdraw from the study  (i.e., discont inue study  medicati on 
perm anent ly and wi thdraw from  visit assessments), without prejudice to further treatment 
(withdrawal  of consent). Wi thdrawal  of consent from  the study  must be ascertained and 
docum ented by  [CONTACT_309556] (ICF). The withdrawal addendum to ICFshould be 
signed and dated by  [CONTACT_309557] a nd the investigator, if possible. Such pat ients will always 
be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The reason for permanent 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent wi th the study  medicati on and the date of the last intake of the 
study  medicat ion must be docum ented in the eCRF. 
To ensure validit y of study  data, i t is very  important to collect as much data as possible 
throughout the study  and especially  vital status (dead or alive) at the EOS. The invest igator or 
delegate will  therefore attem pt to co llect informat ion on all patients’ vital status from publicly 
available sources at the EOS visit, in accordance with local regulations ,even if Informed 
Consent has been withdrawn co mpletely.

patients).
3.10.2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (invest igational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs. The Invest igator will fo llow up AEs outside of the clinical study . 
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrolment /randomi zation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. Patients who agree to 
continued study participation following investigational product discontinuation, 
including modified follow -up such as telephone calls or medical record review, hav e not 
withdrawn consent.

5.2 Safety assessments
Safety will be assessed throughout the study . A complete baseline profile of each patientwill be 
established through demographics, medical history, clinical laboratory  values, vital signs, 
physical assessments, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). During the course of the study , vital 
signs, com plete and targeted phy sical as sessments, laboratory  tests, and ECGs will be performed 
at regular intervals. 
Adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAEs) and ongoing conco mitant m edicati on usage 
will be mo nitored and recorded throughout the study . SAE reports will be evaluated in dividually  
to assess for the impact of the event, if any, on the overall safet y of the product and on the study

until reso lved, stable, or until the patient’s EOS visit. See Section 6for details on AE and SAE 
reporting.
Safety will be assessed through:
 Adverse events
 Laboratory  parameters 
 Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, ECG)
 Adjudicated cardiovascular, cerebrov ascular and thro mbotic/thro mboembo lic events
5.2.1 Cardiovascular events
MACE+ events (death, non -fatal MI, non -fatal stroke, heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309526]) shoul d be reported as SAEs in the eCRF and will be

Standard [ADDRESS_379532] be evaluated in clinical 
context (based on patient’s medical history  and conco mitant m edica tion) and the invest igator 
shoul d determine if it is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormalit ies should be 
reported as an AE.
Only the visit, ECG date, heart rate (HR), RR Interval, PR Interval, QRS Interval, QT Interval, 
overall interpret ation and relevant comments will be recorded in the eCRF. ECG recordings will 
be kept as source documents.
5.2.5 Vital signs
The vital signs, blood pressure and heart rate, will be assessed at the visits as described in the 
Study  Plan, Table 1and recorded in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Heart rate and blood pressure
At most visi ts, HR and BP will be measured according to usual clinical pract ice and recorded.
On specific visits indicated in Table [ADDRESS_379533] 5 min. The position o f the pati ent 
shoul d be comfortabl e with the arm  where the blood pressure is recorded to b e within the level o f 
heart (the middle o f the cuff on the upper arm is at the level o f the right atri um (the midpoint of 
the sternum ). The pati ent will be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during 
the measurement procedure. Preferably  measurement will be d one wi th an electroni c autom ated 
oscillo metri c device. The same device should preferably  be used for the pati ent during the course 
of the study  and in the same arm. Blood pressure will be measured in triplicate with at least one -
minute intervals between me asurements. In HD patients BP and HR will be assessed prior to 
initiation of the dialysis procedures. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients BP and HR will be 
assessed when they  com e to the clinic. All the three readings will be reported in the eCRF. 
The he art rate will be assessed by  [CONTACT_309561] 30 s immediately  after each 
recording of the blood pressure. It could be also performed with an oscillo metric device if this is 
used for blood pressure measurement. The triplicate heart rate assessmen ts will recorded in the 
eCRF.
Blood pressure m easurem ents are to be obtained prior to init iation of each dialysis procedure.
5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Patient reported outcomes
All study  patients will  be asked to com plete the Euro Qualit y of life (QoL) H ealth Utili ty Index 
questionnaire at time po ints indicated in the Study  Plan, Table 1. The questionnaires should be 
completed by  [CONTACT_309562].

61(100)[IP_ADDRESS] EuroQol Health Utility Index –EQ-5D-
5L
TheEQ-5D- 5L is a self -reported questionnaire measuring utilit y values. The EQ -5D consists of 
the EQ -5D descript ive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ -5D descript ive 
system  com prises 5 dimensio ns of healt h: mobility; self -care; usual act ivities; pain/disco mfort; 
and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate 
probl ems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self -rated 
healt h status on a graduated (0 -100) scale, wher e the endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable 
healt h state’ and ‘worst imaginable healt h state’ with higher scores for higher HRQoL. EQ 5D 
healt h states, defined by [CONTACT_20367] -5D descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary 
index by  [CONTACT_2931] a for mula that essentially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the 
levels in each dimensio n. The index can range from 1 for full healt h to 0 for being dead, but it 
can also be below 0 indicat ing a healt h state worse than being dead.
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration of patient -reported outcome
All patient -reported outcomes (PROs) are paper -based and will be administered at baseline and 
according to Study  plan,Table 1and recorded in the eCRF.
Each center must allocate the res ponsibilit y for the administration of the quest ionnaire to a 
specific individual (e.g., a research nurse, study  coordinator) and if possible assign a back -up 
person to cover if that individual is absent. The [COMPANY_008] Study  Team  (or del egate) will 
provi de rel evant training in administration of the questionnaire. The significance and relevance 
of the data need to be explained carefully  to parti cipating patients so that they  are m otivated to 
comply with data collect ion.
The instructions for complet ion of t he PRO questionnaire are as fo llows:
 The EQ -5D- 5L must be completed prior to any other study  procedures (following 
Inform ed Consent) and before discussio n of disease progress to avoid biasing the 
patient’s responses to the questions. They must be completed in private by [CONTACT_102]
 The patient should be given sufficient time to complete at their own speed
 The patient should not receive help from relat ives, friends or clinic staff to answer the 
questionnaire. However, if the patient is unable to read the que stionnaire (e.g. is 
visually impaired) the quest ionnaire may be read out by  [CONTACT_309563]
 On co mpletion of the questionnaire it should be handed back to the person responsible 
for questi onnaire who shoul d check for completenes s
 Only one answer should be recorded for each question

5.4 Pharmacokinetics
5.4.1 Collection of samples
Venous blood samples (4 mL) for determination of roxadustat concentration in plasma will be 
collected at week 4 and week 8, only for patients taking roxadustat. Patients will be instructed 
NOT to take the study  medicati on on the day  of week 4 visi t (not necessary  for week 8). If a 
dose of the study  medicat ion is scheduled for that day , the dose can be given AFTER the 
collect ion of the blood sample. For both visits the date and time of sample co llection wil l be 
recorded as well as the last dosing date and time of study  medicati on. 
Samples will  be collected into appropriately  labelled tubes containing sodium -heparin as 
anticoagulant. Immediately  after collect ion, blood samples will be kept on melt ing ice unt il ready 
for centrifugat ion, which must be done within [ADDRESS_379534] ion. Bl ood sam ples will be 
centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes at room temperature in order to obtain plasma. Plasma will 
be harvested and transferred into an appropriately labell ed amber polypropylene storage tube and 
stored at -20°C or below, within [ADDRESS_379535] es frozen. All applicable shippi[INVESTIGATOR_309532]. Further 
details will be provided in the laboratory  manual.
5.4.2 Determination of drug concentration
For the pati ents receiving roxadustat, samples for pharmacokinet ic (PK) determinat ion will be 
analysed by [CONTACT_309564], [COMPANY_008] R&D, using 
validated bioanaly tical methods. Full details of the analy tical methods used will be described in a 
separate bioanalyt ical report.
The pl asma concentration data will be li sted, summarized on the basis of time intervals and 
plotted in scattering with t ime relat ive to the immediate preceding roxadustat dosing t ime. A 
popul ation PK analysis o f data collected in the CKD dialysis program will be performed using 
the non -linear mi xed-effects m odelling technique as outlined in a populat ion PK analysis plan.
5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples
PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanaly tical Report finalizat ion orsix months after 
issuance o f the draft Bi oanaly tical Report (whi chever is earlier), unless requested for future 
analyses.
Incurred sample reproducibilit y analysis, if any , will  be perform ed al ongside the bioanalysis of 
the test samples. The results fro m the evaluat ion will  not be reported in the Clinical Study  Report 
but separately in a Bioanalyt ical Report.

Pharmacogenetic samples  
will be collected at baseline, i.e., at (week 0) randomization visit.
5.6.1 Collection of phar macogenetic samples
The patient’s consent to participate in the pharmacogenetic research components of the study is 
mandatory. Patients may participate in the study  without participating in genetic sampling. 
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients at (week 0) 
randomization visit.  Alt hough genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is 
preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding patient s who may withdraw due to an AE, 
such patient s would be important to include in any ge netic analysis. If for any reason the sample 
is not drawn at the randomization visit it may be taken at any visit un til the last study visit, 
before starting the closure period. Only one sample should be collected per patient for genetics during the study. 
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.

necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Sect ion 6.2. On the

The only epoetin alfa to be used in the study  is Procri t®, Eprex® and Epogen® .
In countri es where epoetin alfa is not expected to be marketed for the duration of study , or where 
local regulati ons prevent reimbursement, Eprex will be centrally  supplied by [CONTACT_38227]. In 
these centrally supplied countries only , pati ents requi ring Eprex doses >45,000 IU/week or 
15,000IU/administration should not be enrolled.
7.2 Dose and treatment regimens
7.2.1 Randomization
Eligible pat ients will be randomized to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization schedules will be prospectively prepared. Automated randomization and 
assignment to treatment arm will be provided by [CONTACT_10966]/IVRS. The randomizat ion in this study  
will be stratified by [CONTACT_1606] .
The number of tablet bottles (or amount of epoetin alfa supplied b y [COMPANY_008]) that will be 
dispensed may  vary depending on the dose. Dispensation will be managed by  [CONTACT_10966]/IVRS. The 
administration will be detailed on a dosing card. Doses administered will be recorded in the 
eCRF.
7.2.[ADDRESS_379553] dose of stud y drug shoul d be administered on Day  1 (week 0), and will mark the 
beginning of the treatment period. This should correspond to a day  when the next dose of 
erythropoi etin analogue would have been administered in pat ient currently treated with 
erythropoi etin analogue. All rando mizat ion visit study  procedures including laboratory  blood 
draws are to be completed prior to administration of the first dose of study  drug. All dose 
adjustm ents shoul d be based on Hb values using Hemocue, a point -of-care device, at v isits 
specified in Table 1. Hb values will be recorded in the eCRF (screening) and IWRS (during 
treatm ent peri od).
Missed dose should not be replaced.
7.2.3 Dosing of Roxadustat
Roxadustat will be dosed orally three time s a week (TIW) throughout the treatment period unless 
dose reduction is required based on Hb levels. For hemodialysis patients, it is reco mmended that 
roxadustat is taken after completion of the hemodialysis sessio n
.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients treated with erythropoietin an alogue at study entry 
Patients randomized to roxadustat will discont inue any prior ery thropoi etin analogue therapy and 
start roxadustat. The starting dose of roxadustat will be based on the current ery thropoi etin 
analogue dose at screening visit 1 (Table 4). If  the mean hemoglo bin during the screening phase 
(e.g. the average of central laboratory  values at vi sit [ADDRESS_379554] of visit 2 value, i f applicable) is less than 10 g/dL, the starting dose will be

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383]
8.1 Statistical considerations
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979]. A comprehensive SAP will be 
prepared prior to database lock.  It is recognized that Regulatory  Authorities might requi re 
different efficacy  and/or safet y endpo ints or al ternate analyses for approval. The endpoints and 
analyses described in this protocol are intended for the US (FDA) submissio n. Regio nal SAPs 
will fully  describe any changes to endpoint s or analyses that differ fro m those described in this 
protocol . 
8.2 Sample size estimate
Primary efficacy variable: With at least [ADDRESS_379564] 99% power 
to demonstrate non -inferiorit y of roxadustat versus epoetin alfa for the primary efficacy  endpoint 
(i.e., Hb change fro m baseline to the average level during the evaluat ion peri od defined as Week 
28 until Week 52). This assumes a difference (roxadustat minus epoetin alfa) of 
-0.30 g/dL, a 
non-inferiorit y margin for this differ ence of -0.75 g/dL and a standard deviat ion of 1.25 g/dL.
To contribute adjudicated CV events for the pooled CV analyses across the phase 3 program: 
approximately  2000 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either roxadustat or active 
control , i.e. epoetin alfa. The sample size for this study  is driven by  [CONTACT_309548] 3 program in dialysis -treated CKD subjects (which consists 
of four studi es in total targeting 611 subjects with MACE events). The three other studies in the 
study  program  are FG -4592 -064, 1517 -CL-0613, FG-4592- 063.

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would res ult in the 
subject ’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved wit hout hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309540] i n itself a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject wasenrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations whe re important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913], disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion ofserious.  
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.

95(100)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the fo llowing factors when deciding if there
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
 Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the 
administration of the su spect drug?
 Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
proper ties?
 De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
 No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_309581], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally 
recommend or support a re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the re levant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be asse ssed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form tha t, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:

Aminotransferase and Total Bilirubin -Hy’s Law
1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The invest igator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any  point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria ar e met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_309582] (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/H L cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of study  medicat ion  irrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP). The el evations do not have to occur at the same t ime or within a specified time frame.
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN  together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  The el evati ons do not have to occur at the same t ime 
or wi thin a specified time frame.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF PO TENTIAL HY’S LAW CAS ES
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive revi ew of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3xULN
 AST ≥ 3xULN
 TBL ≥ 2xULN
When a pat ient meets any of the identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in combination, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative).

98(100)The Investiga tor will also rem ain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_19690]
 Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Sectio n 2of this Appendix 
for definit ion) by [CONTACT_309583] (including 
both central and local laboratory  resul ts)
4. FOLLOW -UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient do es not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
 Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow
-up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
 Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
 Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician
 Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
 If at any  time (in consulta tion wi th the Study  Physici an) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures

99(100)5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMEN T OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL crite ria are m et.
No later than [ADDRESS_379584] and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and fo llow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causalit y assessment as per above
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the 
outcom e of the re view

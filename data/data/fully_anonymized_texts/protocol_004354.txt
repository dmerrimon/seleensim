Version Date: 08/12 /17 Brief Summary/Abstract  
This study is designed as a prospective, double arm, study.  Patients with a diagnosed rupture of the anterior 
cruciate ligament (ACL) who are scheduled for surgical reconstruction will be considered for enrollment.  
Eligible subjects will be allocated to one of two groups  based on the location of the tibial tunnel  (anterior vs. 
posterior) during the surgical procedure.  The study population will consist of patients 16 -50 years of age, 
with ACL rupture, who are seeking surgical reconstruction.  Patients with active infection, previous ACL 
surgery, multiple ligament knee injury, previous joint modifying surgery in target knee within 12 months of 
planned procedure, flexion contracture, valgus alignment, pathologic ligament instability, knee 
osteoarthritis, inflammatory joint disease, metabolic bone disease (marked bone  loss or moderate to severe 
osteoporosis), comorbidities such as type 1 diabetes, connective tissue disorder, or morbid obesity 
(BMI  ≥35) will be excluded.  
 
Subjects will return for follow -up visits at 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_181806] -operative time point  (retrospective aspect of the st udy) .  
 
The primary objective of this study is to collect data on subjective and objective measures of knee related 
functio n in subjects with an anterior vs. posterior placed tibial tunnel through [ADDRESS_181807] to : 
1. Clinically significant difference of at least [ADDRESS_181808] 2.4 mm knee joint laxity  (KT-1000)  
 
Background  
1. Provide the scientific background, rat ionale and relevance of this project.   
 
Although extensive research has been carried out on ACL Femoral Tunnel placement, very little attention has 
been given to the tibial tunnel.  Staubli et al. suggest that the tibial tunnel be placed in the center of the ACL 
footprint, which they described as being approximately 43% of the way (anterior to posterior) across the 
proximal tibia at its widest extent.¹ However, others have suggested that a more anterior placement may yield 
improved biomechanical² and clinical³ results.  The center of the ACL footprint and the posterior aspect of the 
anterior horn of the lateral meniscus does not yield tibial tunnel placement a consistent percentage of the way 
across the tibial plateau4, therefore, guidelines should be based  on intraoperative fluoroscopic measurements.  
However, the question remaining is what percentage of the A -P distance across the tibia is the ideal location 
for the tibial tunnel in ACL reconstruction.  This study will help answer that question.

Statistical Considerations  
1. Is stratification/randomization involved? Yes.  
 
►IF YES, describe the stratification/ randomization scheme. 
Block r andomization will be completed a priori  via a random number generator.  20 subjects will be allocated 
to group within each block (1 0 per group).  Group assignments will be sealed in an opaque envelope each 
containing a number from [ADDRESS_181811] will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the 
treatments (group) described below.  Randomization envelope #[ADDRESS_181812] for 
the second and so on.  Group assignment for enrolled subjects  will be determined intra -operatively.  Prior to 
the determination of group assignment, the treating surgeon will drill two tibial tunnel guide pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], assessing 
pin placement via fluoroscopy, to ensure that one tunnel is anterior and the other is posterior to the 35% line.  
The sealed envelope will then be opened following confirmation of guide pin placement, and the procedure 
will be performed in accordance with the randomized group assignment.  
 
Patients with a prior history of ACL reconstruction who enter the study post- operatively will be assigned to the 
appropriate group based on graft placement (anterior or posterior)  that was performed for clinical care .  
 
►IF YES, who  will generate the randomization scheme?  
__X_ _ Other :  Study coordinator  
 
2.  What are the statistical considerations for the protocol?  
We have designed the study in a way that will make it easy to match an appropriate statistical procedure to 
test our primary hypotheses.  Subjective and objective measures of knee function will be evaluated at 6, [ADDRESS_181813]- surgery.  
 
3.  Provide a justification for the sample size used in this protocol.   
Sample size for IKDC and KT -1000 side-side differences are calculate d based on the expected between- group 
differences observed at the final time point  of this study – [ADDRESS_181814] a 8 -point difference in IKDC score between groups assuming 
variability of 12 points in  IKDC score.6  These estimates account for 20% attrition.  Estimates are calculated to 
find statistically significant differences allowing for 5% type I error rate and power exceeding 80%.   
 
4.  What is your plan for primary variable analysis?  
We will use  independent t tests to determine group differences at each time point.

Version Date: 08/12 /17 7.  Will data from multiple sites be combined during analysis?  Yes 
 
7(a).  Does the study involve randomization?  Yes  
 
IF YES, will randomization be done at each site or among sites?   
Randomization will be done at each site.  
 
7(b).  Has the sample size calculation considered the variation among sites? Yes  
 
7(c).  When combining the data from multiple sites to assess the study results, is the effect of the 
treatment to be tested (or the association to be tested) assumed to be the same across sites or vary 
among sites? What is the modelling strategy?  
Yes.  The effect of the treatment (placement of tibial tunnel) will be assessed using standard measures 
of joint laxity and patient -reported function.  We have no evidence to believe that these outcomes 
differ between sites under standard protocols.  
 
7(d). Is there a common protocol used in all sites? NO 
 
IF NO, how will differences among sites, such as those related to the implementation, 
inclusion criteria, patient characteristics, or other sites characteristics, be considered to 
assess the study results?  
Potential subjects will be identified, screened, and eligibility criteria reviewed in a similar 
manner at each institution.  Each practice will follow the s ame criteria for enrollment.  
Statistical considerations will be employed following the completion of data collection to 
account for differences in patient characteristics/ demographics.

Risk/ Benefit Analysis  
1.  What are the potential benefits for the participant as well as benefits , which may accrue to society in 
general, as a result of this study?  
The risks include knee soreness from the physical exam and radiation exposure from x -ray.  Benefits from a 
clinical perspective include providing evidence to improve clinical care through surgical intervention.  
 
2.  Do the anticipated benefits justify asking subjects to undertak e the risks?   
The risks to the subject are low and the potential benefit to society, through knowledge gained about ACL 
outcomes, is great, therefore the risk -benefit ratio is optimal.

publication.  This “permission” may come in the form of a contract with the sponsor or a material transfer 
agree ment (MTA) with others.  A contract/ MTA is needed to share the data outside of UVa even if the data 
includes no HIPAA identifiers and no code that could link the data back to a HIPAA identifier.   
• No data will be shared outside of UVa, beyond using data for a grant application and or publication, 
without a signed contract/MTA approved by [CONTACT_156867]/ OSP or written 
confirmation that one is not needed.  
• No specimens will be shared outside of UVa without a signed contract/MTA approved by [CONTACT_156868]/ OSP or written confirmation that one is not needed.  
 
Prisoners  
If the original protocol/ IRB application stated that no prisoners would be enrolled in this study and subsequently 
a subject becomes a prisoner, the study team must notify the IRB immediately.  The study team and IRB will 
need to determine if the subject will remain in the study.  If the subject will remain in the study, the protocol 
will have to be re -reviewed with the input of a prisoner advocate.  The prisoner advocate will also have to be 
involved in the review of future continuations, modifications or  any other reporting such as protocol violations 
or adverse events.   
 
Prisoner - Individuals are prisoners if they are in any kind of penal institution, such as a prison, jail, or juvenile 
offender facility, and their ability to leave the institution is re stricted. Prisoners may be convicted felons, or 
may be untried persons who are detained pending judicial action, for example, arraignment or trial.  
For additional information see the OHRP website at  http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/populations/index.html  
 
Compensation in Case of Injury  
If a subject requests compensation for an injury, the study team should notify the IRB -HSR (924 -
9634/2439847) the UVa Health System Patient Relations Depar tment (924 -8315).  As a proactive courtesy, the 
study team may also notify UVa Health System Patient Safety and Risk Management (924 -5595).  
 
On request, the study team should provide the Risk Management Office with the following 
information/documents:  
• Subj ect Name [CONTACT_156905]  
• Research medical records  
• Research consent form  
• Adverse event report to IRB  
• Any letter from IRB to OHRP  
 
Subject Complaints  
During a research study, the study team may receive complaints from a subject.  If the study team  is uncertain 
how to respond to a complaint, or is unable to resolve it with the subject, the study team may contact [CONTACT_1201] -
HSR (924 -9634/243 -9847), the UVa Health System Patient Relations Department (924 -8315).

Version Date: 08/12 /[ADDRESS_181827] understands what is being covered in the consent form.   
Questions might include:   
• Would you summarize for me what you believe will be done to you if you are in this study?  
• Would you benefit from this study?  
• What do you feel are the risks of being in this study?  
 
Potential subjects will be given an opportunity to ask questions.  Their level of understanding will 
dictate how much time will be spent covering each item.  Once all of their questions have been 
answered, if they decide to participate, they will be asked to sign the consent form.  The person 
obtaining consent will sign the form and subjects will be given a copy of the signed consent form. Study 
procedures will then begin.  The informed c onsent process for each individual subject will be 
documented in the subject’s medical record.  
 
 
6. Will subjects sign a consent form for any part of the study? Yes  
 
7.  Will the study procedures be started the same day the subject is recruited for the stu dy? No 
 
 
8.  Is there the potential to recruit economically or educationally disadvantaged subjects, or other 
vulnerable subjects such as students or employees?  Yes 
 
IF YES, what protections are in place to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects so 
that any possible coercion or undue influence is eliminated?   
All potential subjects will be provided the same study description and list of eligibility criteria.  
All subjects will be compensated equally.  Additional benefits beyond those described wi ll not 
be offered to any participants.  
 
9. Do you need to perform a “dry run” of any procedure outlined in this protocol?   No

Version Date: 08/12 /17 APPENDIX:  Participation of Children  
In the state of Virginia a person under the age of 18 is considered a child.  
1. Explain why this research topic is relevant to children.    
this topic is extremely relevant to children given the continued high prevalence of ACL injury in youth 
populations.  Sporting activity through adolescents is advocated from a global health perspective, t hereby 
[CONTACT_156888].  
 
2. Is the knowledge being sought in this study already available for children or is it currently being acquired 
through another ongoing study?   No  
 
3. Provide data that is available in adults in order that the IRB may judge the potential risk in children.  If 
there is no adult data available, provide reasons why not.  If this information is available in a sponsor’s 
protocol, you may reference the section # here and not duplicate the information.    
Surgical reconstruction is standard of care for a complete rupture of the ACL.  It is unknown whether 
directing the placement of the tibial tunnel to a more anterior or posterior position during this procedure 
will yield better patient outcomes.  Therefore, these is no data to support one technique (placement) over 
the other, which is the purpose of this study.  ACL reconstruction poses no additional risk in children 
beyond that in adults.  
 
4. Is the potential subject population likely to include wards of  the state or children who are more at risk 
for becoming a ward of the state?  YES   
INSTRUCTIONS:  
• There are provisions in the research regulations that pertain to the participation of children 
who are considered wards of the state.  A “ward,” in this context signifies any child who has been 
adjudged dependent by a court and who is under the care or custody of a public official or agency, 
which may include foster children, or any child under the control of the Department of Social Services 
in the state of Virginia.  An incarcerated youth is a child who is in penal custody or otherwise detained 
within the criminal justice system.  These children are often under the care of the Department of 
Youth Services and some may also be wards of the state.  Recruiti ng a ward of the state for research 
may be a very infrequent or unlikely event.  It is important that these children not be discriminated 
against with regards to enrollment in research especially if the research offers a potential for benefit. 
However, the ir enrollment requires additional IRB determinations including the IRB appointing an 
advocate.  Therefore, you are asked to consider the possibility of enrolling a ward of the state based 
upon eligibility criteria and the population of your study.  
• If the study will enroll subjects from patients at UVa, this question MUST be answered YES  
►IF YES:  If the caregiver is someone other than the person providing permission for the child to 
participate, the study team may wish to consider the use of an additional form for them.  (example:a 
child is in foster care however the biological parent has not lost legal custody and provides their 
permission for the child to participate, but the foster parent will be the person involved in driving the 
child to their study vi sits.  This form might address things such as who will receive the compensation 
for driving the child to the visits - the foster parent or the biological parent).

Page 29 of 41 
Version Date: 08/12 /17 ►IF YES and if neither  of the items 4a or 4b listed below is answered YES, children who are w ards of 
the state must be excluded from this protocol. Add “wards of state” as an additional exclusion criteria.  
 
4a. Is the research is this protocol related to the childs’ status as a ward of the state?   No  
 
4b. Is the research to be conducted in schools, camps, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], institutions, or similar settings in 
which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards?    Yes 
 
4c. Are you aware of the following requirement?  
If the consent form contains a signature [CONTACT_156907], if at any time during the course of the research, it becomes known that a potential subject 
is a ward of the state or that a child already enrolled in this protocol becomes a ward of the state.  
Yes 
 
5. Does this study involve a placebo arm? No 
 
6. Will UVa researchers conduct the study outside the state of Virginia? No 
 
Payment  
INSTRUCTIONS:  
 
What is the difference between compensation and reimbursement?  
 
A reimbursement is used when the subject is paid back for travel expenses such as mileage, lodging, food 
while traveling.  Receipts or mileage must be submitted for a reimbursement.  
Compensation  is "payment" for things such as time, discomfort, inconvenience.  
Total possib le compensation should reflect the true value of the total possible dollar amount per participant 
for one year involvement in the study whether it be cash, check, gift card, goods, etc. or a combination of 
these items.  
 
Retention “Gifts” - gifts may be give n to a subject periodically during the study to remind them they are in the 
study.  Sponsors may provide such items as water bottles, birthday cards etc. to the subject.  NOTE:  Cash or 
gift cards are NOT allowed as retention items.  
 
1.  Are subjects being reimbursed for travel expenses (receipts /mileage required) ?No 
 
2.  Are subjects compensated for being in this study? Yes 
 
►IF  YES, answer  the following  questions  (2a-2d).  
2a. What is the maximum TOTAL compensation to be given over the duration of the protocol?  
$100.00

Clinical Trial 
 
Page 30 of 41 
Version Date: 08/12 /17  
2b. Explain compensation to be given.  
Subjects will be compensated $50.00 for the successful completion of study visit 4 and 5 (12 and 24 
months) , with a maximum of $ 100.[ADDRESS_181828] of care.  
 
Subjects will not be compensated if the 12 and 24 month visits are home visits.  Compensation is given 
only for in clinic visits at 12 and 24 months du e to travel expenses, as well as the additional time for 
completion of the strength and gait analyses on the 24 month visit.  Subjects will only receive 
compensation for the 12 month visit if they come in for a clinic visit  and for the 24 month visit if th ey 
come in for a clinic visit  and the gait and strength analyses are  done.  
 
2c. Is payment pro -rated?  
Yes.  Subjects will be compensated $50.00 for completion of study visits 4 and 5 only (12 and 24 
months) , even if they do not complete the entire study.  
 
2d.  Is money paid from UVa or State funds (including grant funds) or will items such as gift cards be 
distributed through UVa?  Yes 
 
2d(i).  How will the researcher compensate the subjects?  
 
__X__ Check issued to participant via UVA Oracle or State system

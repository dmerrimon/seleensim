x 3 days.  Refer to Section 6 for chemotherapy treatment details.
Procedures:
At specific time points as outlined in the schedule of assessments, subjects will undergo the following assessments/procedures: collection of informed consent, general medical history including previous treatments for NHL, physical exam including vital signs and performance status, neurologic assessments, blood draws for complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panels, cytokines, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte subsets, anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies, replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) and anti-CD19 CAR T cell analysis. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine or serum pregnancy test. 
Subjects will also undergo a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), brain 
magnetic resonance image (MRI), a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT/CT), possible bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy and leukapheresis.
Subjects will have lumbar punctures performed for the collection of CSF (see Section 11.9 and SOA) 
before and after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.
Routinely throughout the conduct of the study, subjects will be asked to report concomitant medications 
and adverse events and will have their disease assessed.
Methodology/Study Design: This is a Phase [ADDRESS_824982] will proceed through the following study periods:
Screening
Enrollment/Leukapheresis period

142.OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of anakinra as preventative management 
of neurotoxicity, as measured by [CONTACT_620330], following axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with aggressive refractory NHL. 
The key secondary objectives include assessment of rate and severity of cytokine release 
syndrome and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
in terms of DOR, ORR, PFS, and OS .
Exploratory objectives to include comparison of Zuma-1 CRS/NT grading criteria to new ASBMT criteria, levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood, levels of cytokines in serum and CSF, incidence of anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies and other investigation of potential biomarker development based on assessment of blood cells, tumor cells and the proposed actions of the investigational product.
2.1 Study Design
Study 19-348 is a Phase 2 single center, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
anakinra when combined with axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma.   
Approximately 20 subjects with aggressive refractory NHL, including DLBCL, PMBCL, high 
grade lymphoma or TFL will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of anakinra in combination with axicabtagene ciloleucel.  If the initial regimen is determined to be safe, the study may be expanded beyond the initial 20 patient cohort. A SRT comprised of the study sponsor and Kite/[COMPANY_009], will review the safety data and make recommendations on further study conduct
For study requirements assigned to each study period, please refer to the schedule of assessments 
(SOA) and Section [ADDRESS_824993] will proceed through the following study periods:

3. BACKGROUND
3.1 Disease Background and Rationale
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of cancers originating in B 
lymphocytes, T lymphocytes or natural killer cells.  In the [LOCATION_002], B cell lymphomas represent 80-85% of cases reported.  In 2013, approximately 69,[ADDRESS_824994] prevalent hematological malignancy and is the seventh leading site of new cancers among men and women and account for 4% of all new cancer cases and 3% of deaths related to cancer 
2.  Large 
B-cell lymphomas represent the most common sub-group of NHL 3.
3.1.1 Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of large B-cell lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30% of NHL cases.  There are approximately 22,[ADDRESS_824995] line combination chemotherapy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] R-CHOP) or who do not respond to their last course of combination chemotherapy, as the disease is mostly insensitive to subsequent combination chemotherapy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] R-ICE, R-ESHAP) (Table 1).

6.  Seshadri et al analyzed 120 
patients who did not respond to second line platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (e.g., R-ICE) and showed that only 14% responded to their third line therapy 
7.  Ardeshna et al followed 19 
patients with large B-cell lymphoma, and 9 patients with TFL who did not respond to second line chemotherapy.  Only 5 of the 28 total patients (18%) responded to third line chemotherapy

3.1.2 Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma and Transformed Follicular Lymphoma
Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) has distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular 
characteristics compared to DLBCL.  PMBCL is thought to arise from thymic (medullary) B cells and represents approximately 3% of patients diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma.  PMBCL is typi[INVESTIGATOR_620301] a slight female predominance 
14,15.  Gene expression profiling suggests deregulated pathways in PMBCL overlap 
with Hodgkin lymphoma.  Initial therapy of PMBCL generally includes anthracycline-containing regimens with rituximab with or without involved field radiotherapy.  A recent Phase 2, prospective study of infusional dose-adjusted etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) demonstrated radiotherapy may not be required

Follicular lymphoma (FL), a B cell lymphoma, is the most common indolent (slow-growing) form of NHL, accounting for approximately 20% to 30% of all NHLs.  Some patients with FL will transform (TFL) histologically to DLBCL which is more aggressive and associated with a poor outcome.  Histological transformation to DLBCL occurs at an annual rate of approximately 3%

17for 15 years with the risk of transformation continuing to drop in subsequent years.  The biologic 
mechanism of histologic transformation is unknown.  Initial treatment of TFL is influenced by [CONTACT_115230][INVESTIGATOR_620302]-containing regimens with rituximab to eliminate the aggressive component of the disease 
17.  
Treatment options for relapsed/refractory PMBCL and TFL are similar to those in DLBCL.  Given the low prevalence of these diseases, no large prospective randomized studies in these patient populations have been conducted.  Patients with chemotherapy refractory disease have a similar or worse prognosis 
18 to those with refractory DLBCL.  
In addition, the international, multicohort retrospective non-Hodgkin lymphoma research (SCHOLAR-1) study retrospectively evaluated outcomes in patients with chemorefractory DLBCL, PMBCL, and TFL.  SCHOLAR-1 integrated data from two Phase 3 studies (LYSARC-CORAL and Canadian Cancer Trials Group LY.12) and 2 observational cohorts (MD Anderson Cancer Center and Mayo Clinic/University of Iowa Specialized Program of Research Excellence).  Among 861 patients, 635 were included based on chemorefractory search criteria.  Outcomes were consistently poor, regardless of refractory subgroup and across cohorts.  The results of SCHOLAR-1 indicated that patients with chemorefractory, aggressive DLBCL represent a homogenous patient population with a response rate of 26% (complete response [CR] rate of 7%) and median overall survival of 6.3 months 
19.
3.1.3 High Grade B-cell Lymphoma
In 2016, the World Health Organization introduced a new category of large B-cell lymphomas 
called high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) 20.  This designation includes large B-cell 
lymphomas with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements that are phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_620303] B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable (this latter category has since been eliminated).  MYC rearrangements in large B-cell lymphomas are associated with a poor prognosis that is worsened in cases of concomitant BCL2 and/or BCL6 alterations, ie, double- or triple-hit lymphomas.  As such, patients with HGBCL are likely to face poor survival outcomes.
3.2 T cell Therapy for Aggressive Refractory Lymphomas
3.2.1 Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
Axicabtagene ciloleucel are anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) autologous human T cells 
that have been engineered to express an extracellular single chain variable fragment (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an intracellular signaling part comprised of signaling domains from CD28 and CD3ζ (CD3-zeta) molecules arranged in tandem (Figure 2). 
An anti-CD19 CAR vector construct was previously designed, optimized and initially tested at the 
Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, IND [ZIP_CODE]) (Figure 2.) 
21,22.  The scFv is 
derived from the variable region of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC63 23.  A portion of 
the CD28 costimulatory molecule is added, as murine models suggest this is important for the anti-tumor effect and persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
24.  The signaling domain of the CD3-zeta

18chain is essential for T cell activation.  These fragments were cloned into the murine stem cell 
virus-based (MSGV1) vector, utilized to genetically engineer the autologous T cells.  
Kite Pharma performed larger scale clinical development of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells, 
and named this therapeutic engineered cell product axicabtagene ciloleucel. Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel was FDA approved in 2017 based on data from the Zuma-1 study which demonstrated objective response rates upwards of 83%, with a median OS that has not been reached (Locke, Lancet Oncology 2018).  Real world data of axicabtagene has demonstrated similarly robust response rates and durability, but further emphasized the need for improved toxicity management. This real world experience demonstrated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
and neurotoxicty rates of 96% and 76% with grade ≥ 3 events seen in 17% and 38% respectively 
(Jacobson et al, ASH 2018).

chills, hypotension, hypoxia, and when extreme, macrophage activation syndrome. Manifestations 
of neurotoxicity vary and include confusion, obtundation, seizures, hallucinations, aphasia, ataxia, 
and more rarely, profound cerebral edema25. The future success and application of commercial 
product to a broader population of patients is limited by [CONTACT_620331]

19toxicities. CRS is managed in the inpatient setting with administration of the anti-IL6 receptor 
antibody tocilizumab, with or without steroids, only after the onset of CRS in the setting of clinical decline
25. The CRS associated with CAR T cells shares many pathogenic features of macrophage 
activation syndrome26. CAR-T related neurotoxicity is thought to be cytokine mediated in the 
setting of macrophage and endothelial activation and is predominantly managed with steroids alone
27, because tocilizumab has no therapeutic efficacy against CAR T cell-related neurotoxicity. 
Tocilizumab has been studied in the prophylactic setting as part of the third cohort of ZUMA-1; these data showed that despi[INVESTIGATOR_620304], investigators found that there was an increase in the incidence of severe neurotoxicity. This was felt to be related to the poor CNS penetration of tocilizumab, which may have led to increased intracerebral levels of IL-6.
[ADDRESS_825000], has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis related macrophage activation syndrome, as well as in recent mouse models of CRS and neurotoxicity in which lethal CRS and neurotoxicity were abrogated with the use of anakinra (figure 3)

tocilizumab-refractory cytokine release syndrome, and have noted improvements in neurologic function. These data suggest that IL-[ADDRESS_825001] (rhIL-1ra). Endogenous IL-1 is induced 
by [CONTACT_620332]. Anakinra can be administered subcutaneously. Anakinra is currently FDA approved for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Sub-cutaneous and intravenous administration of anakinra have been studied in multiple contexts. 
Anakinra was administered intravenously to patients with sepsis in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the 1990s
32-34. In these trials, rhIL-1ra was administered using different 
regimens; all included an intravenous (IV) loading dose of 100 mg administered over about 60 seconds and followed by [CONTACT_620333] 8 or 12 h by a volumetric infusion

20pump at a constant rate (17-133 mg/h, n=74, or 1- 2 mg/kg/h, n=941) for 72 h. The frequencies of 
(serious) adverse events were not significantly different between the treatment and placebo groups. No unique clinical or laboratory adverse events were significantly more frequent in the anakinra-treated patients compared to the placebo group, and there was no evidence of delayed resolution of infection or increased frequency of secondary infections in the anakinra-treated group
34. Before 
these trials of rhIL-1ra in sepsis, a phase I study of rhIL-1Ra administered intravenously at different doses had been conducted in [ADDRESS_825002] occurred designed to assess the safety of 
patients receiving anakinra monotherapy and combinations with other immunosuppressive agents. One such study by [CONTACT_620334]. included 1414 patients receiving a variety of concurrent medications for RA including some disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), as well as patients who were DMARD-free. Concurrent DMARDs included MTX, sulfasalazine, 
hydroxychloroquine, gold, penicillamine, leflunomide, and azathioprine. Although Serious 
infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_620305] (2.1% versus 0.4% in the 
placebo group), this was ultimately felt to be secondary to combination with other 
immunosuppressive agents and therefore should be monitored36.
Several pharmacokinetic studies have been performed for subcutaneous treatment. In subjects with RA, maximum plasma concentrations of anakinra occurred 3 to 7 hours after subcutaneous administration of anakinra at clinically relevant doses (1 to 2 mg/kg; n = 18); the terminal half-life ranged from 4 to 6 hours. In RA patients, no unexpected accumulation of Kineret was observed after daily subcutaneous doses for up to 24 weeks. The mean plasma clearance of Kineret in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) and moderate (creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min) renal insufficiency was reduced by 16% and 50%, respectively and no significant dose reduction was recommended upon FDA approval. 
Refer to the most recent version of the package insert from the FDA label for additional details 
surrounding the anakinra.
3.4 Correlative Studies Background
Correlative studies will be performed on peripheral blood, bone marrow/tumor biopsies and, if available, CSF samples to evaluate PK/PD markers related to safety and/or efficacy. The effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel T cells may depend on the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells in subjects. Therefore, the expansion and persistence will be monitored by [CONTACT_620335]. Samples will be collected per the protocol Schedule of Events (see 11.1 Schedule of Events). Periodic 
monitoring of anti-inflammatory cytokines secretion will be performed to determine correlation between axicabtagene ciloleucel efficacy and/or toxicity; in addition,  CD19 expression on tumor cells will be evaluated at the eligibility and in subjects failing to achieve a complete response.

Additionally, different T cell subsets  have demonstrated different effector function and persistence and, therefore, T cell immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_620307]. Peripheral blood samples will be analyzed for cytokine/chemokine levels by [CONTACT_620336]. Tumor tissue will be analyzed for CD19 expression by [CONTACT_145170]/or flow cytometry. Additional clinical samples testing may be performed based on the Exploratory Endpoints as listed in Section 
2.4.
All research samples will be delivered, processed, and frozen as per SOP to either Kite/[COMPANY_009] (for 
VCN and cytokine analysis) or the Maus/Immune Monitoring Laboratory at the MGH Cancer Center for storage and bulk analyses (all other correlative studies). Documentation of sample receipt, processing, and storage and primary data from the research analyses will be collected and stored by [CONTACT_620337]. All research analyses will be performed based on assay-specific SOP using qualified assays.

5.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of any protocol-specific therapy or intervention. Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol-specific therapy or intervention begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied. The registration process includes registration of the participant for study related, as well as initiation of treatment plan related activities. An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the protocol-specific eligibility checklist. This does not include registration with Kite/[COMPANY_009] for manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel which will be performed separately by [CONTACT_620339]. 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol-specific therapy and/or intervention. 
Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If the subject does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the subject must be taken off-study in the CTMS (OnCore) with an appropriate date and reason entered.

6.3 Rationale for Study Treatment Dosing 
6.3.1 Rationale for Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy 
Increasing levels of lymphodepleting chemotherapy correlates with clinical responses to adoptive cell therapy 
38.  Specifically, there appears to be a link between adequate lymphodepletion and 
adoptively transferred T cell expansion and function in pre-clinical models.  The depth and duration of the lymphodepletion in preclinical models correlate with anti-tumor activity of the adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD8+ T cells 
39.  Lymphodepletion may function by 
[CONTACT_472020], eliminating T regulatory cells, or enhancing antigen presenting cell activation 
40.  Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is a potent 
lymphodepleting regimen.  Optimizing the doses of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to improve the depth and duration of lymphodepletion may enhance the activity of axicabtagene ciloleucel.  
As per the FDA approved label for axicabtagene ciloleucel, the lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
dose in will be cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m

The proposed patient population mirrors that of Zuma-1, a multicenter phase 2 study of

IL-6 is a primary mediator of CRS and possibly neurotoxicity, IL-6R targeting is insufficient to prevent these toxicities
29,43. CRS and neurotoxicity prophylaxis has been attempted with 
tocilizumab and although lower rates of CRS were observed, high, if not higher rates of Grade 4+ neurotoxicity were seen (Locke ASH 2017). IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been targeted in various inflammatory states including rheumatoid arthritis and refractory macrophage activation syndromes
30,44.  Recent animal data has demonstrated that IL-1 plays a key role in CRS 
and neurotoxicity and may even prime the myeloid compartment for subsequent IL-6 signaling and activation. Anakinra dosed subcutaneously can achieve 95% bioavailability with a time to peak of 3 to 7 hours, making it ideal for daily prophylactic dosing. Weight based dosing of anakinra 
at 100 mg (if <50kg) vs 200 mg (if ≥50kg) was selected based on currently approved dosing as 
well as substantial clinical data demonstrating safety at doses beyond 200mg45. Daily dosing was 
selected given the short half-life of Anakinra and ongoing cytokine production during CAR-T expansion, as seen in pre-clinical animal models and prior clinical trial experience

Subjects can decline to continue to receive study required treatment and/or other protocol required 
procedures at any time during the study but continue to participate in the study.  This is referred to as partial withdrawal of consent.
If partial withdrawal of consent occurs, the investigator must discuss with the subject the 
appropriate process for discontinuation from investigational product, study treatment or other protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_471993], completion of procedures and the associated data collection as outlined in the SOA. The level of follow-up and method of communication should also be discussed between the research staff and the subject and documented in the source documents.
Withdrawal of full consent from a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further 
protocol required therapy or undergo procedures and the subject does not wish to continue further study follow-up.  Subject data collected up to withdrawal of consent will be retained and included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted by [CONTACT_427], publicly available data (death records) can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study. 
As part of the study sites may be asked to conduct searches of public records, such as those 
establishing survival status, if available, to obtain survival data for any subject for whom the survival status is not known. Sites may be also asked to also retrieve autopsy reports to confirm status of disease at the time of death. 
The investigator and/or sponsor can also decide to withdraw a subject from the investigational 
product and/or other protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], protocol procedures, or the study as a whole or at any time prior to study completion.

7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
In the case of medical or natural emergencies (i.e. holidays, snowstorms, acute infection) occurring 
after initiation of chemotherapy, the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel may be delayed up to one week at the investigator’s discretion. Subjects who do not initiate chemotherapy within 4 weeks of enrollment will be withdrawn; however, their CAR T cell product will be stored for up to 1 year if they re-enroll at a later date. No modifications to the doses will be made at the physician level. 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP websitehttp://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. CTCAE 4.[ADDRESS_825026] as a historical control.

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration or has an association with a worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event.

For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the disease under 
investigation report the signs and symptoms.  Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should also be reported as adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF. 
The investigators clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from 
treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject request to withdraw from protocol required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53392], the subject should undergo the procedures outlined in the Month [ADDRESS_825029] 1 of the following serious

358.4 Procedures for AE and SAE Collection and Reporting  
8.4.1 Reporting of Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for reporting adverse events directly related to study related 
procedures following study registration (leukapheresis) which includes mandated biopsies, lumbar punctures and/or lab draws. Following enrollment (cellular therapy infusion and initiation of anakinra), the investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_620342] [ADDRESS_825032] use, are monitored and reported.  After 3 months, targeted adverse events including (eg, neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary malignancies) will be monitored and reported for [ADDRESS_825033].
For subjects who are enrolled, but do not receive axicabtagene ciloleucel, and/or the investigational 
product, the adverse event reporting period ends [ADDRESS_825034] study-specific procedure (eg, leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy). 
The investigator must address the below for adverse events: 
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome (if not known, signs or symptoms)
Dates of onset and resolution
Severity
Assessment of relatedness to investigational product, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 
axicabtagene ciloleucel or study procedures
Action taken
In reviewing adverse events, investigators must assess whether the adverse event is possibly 
related to 1) the investigational product (anakinra), 2) lymphodepleting chemotherapy, 3) axicabtagene ciloleucel or 4) any protocol-required study procedure.  The relationship is indicated by a yes or no response and entered into the CRF.  A yes response should indicate that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment or procedure and the adverse event.  Additional relevant data with respect to describing the adverse event will be collected in the CRFs.
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an 
abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, abnormal laboratory findings that result in new or worsening clinical sequelae, require therapy or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.

36The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or resolution.  If 
a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event reporting period for non-serious 
adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is started.
8.4.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Non-serious CRS events Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_825035] that occur after signing of the consent through 3 months after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  After 3 months, only serious targeted adverse events (e.g., neurological, hematological, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary malignancies) observed by [CONTACT_472047] [ADDRESS_825036].   For subjects who screen fail or are enrolled but do not receive axicabtagene ciloleucel, and/or anakinra, the 
reporting period for serious adverse events ends [ADDRESS_825037] procedure (e.g., screen procedure, leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy).  
Serious events that the investigator assesses as related to axicabtagene ciloleucel and/or 
anakinra should be reported regardless of the study period.
All serious adverse events and non-serious CRS events ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_825038] be submitted within 24 
hours following the investigators knowledge of the event using a Medwatch Report Form. For 
all SAE’s, submit Medwatch Report forms to the IND  Sponsor, health authorities per local 
reporting guidelines, and Kite/[COMPANY_009] ([EMAIL_201]). Progression of the malignancy 
during the study should not be reported as a serious adverse event. Adverse events associated with disease progression may be reported as serious adverse event.  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome within [ADDRESS_825039], within 6 months of completing the axicabtagene ciloleucel and anakinra administration,

9.1.2 Storage & Stability
Each axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion bag is individually packed in a metal cassette. 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen and supplied in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper. Axicabtagene ciloleucel must be stored at ≤ 150°C immediately after axicabtagene ciloleucel receipt and inspection until the time of thawing and infusion. The site will follow standard operating procedures and/or guidelines for logging or other documentation practices required for inventory and/or storage of cell therapy products. 
For storage in the vapor phase freezer:
oEnsure the cassette is stored in a designated location within the chosen vapor 
phase freezer to prevent potential mix-up with other products. 
oPer institutional SOPs and/or guidelines, log the temperature of the vapor phase freezer at the time the axicabtagene ciloleucel is placed in the vapor phase freezer.

10. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES
10.1 Biomarker Studies
N/A, no biomarker studies.
10.2 Laboratory Correlative Studies
Biomarker analysis will be performed on blood and tumor samples to evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic markers for axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Prognostic markers specific for large B-cell lymphoma and related to the tumor immune environment may also be evaluated in archived and fresh tumor biopsies. 
The presence, expansion, persistence, and immunophenotype of transduced anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells will be monitored in the blood primarily by [CONTACT_79435], complemented by [CONTACT_4133].  Expansion and persistence in peripheral blood will also be monitored by a CD19 CAR specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR).  
Levels of serum cytokines will be evaluated in serum to characterize the pharmacodynamic and 
safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel in combination with anakinra.  The following pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and immune modulating cytokines may be included in the panel:  IL-
6, IL-15, IL-17a, TNF-, GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-12p40/p70 and IL-13; immune effector molecules: 
Granzyme A, B and Perforin; correlates of acute phase response: CRP and SAA; Chemokines 
MIP-1, MIP-1β, MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-8.  In addition, IL1Ra, IL2Rα and ferritin, will also be 
measured.   
Lumbar punctures for collection of CSF samples will be performed at the following time points:  
after eligibility is confirmed and prior to start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion on Day 5 (± 3 days), and at the Week 4 visit (± 3 days).  Collection of CSF samples will enable measurement of baseline cytokine levels prior to axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion.  Changes in levels of cytokines after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion will be measured at the time of peak CAR T-cell expansion (Day 5) and at Week 4 when it is anticipated that cytokine levels would return to baseline levels.

56If a subject progress in the LTFU phase, the subject will continue to be followed for survival status 
and subsequent therapy for the treatment of NHL.  A PMBC sample (for anti-CD19 CAR T cells) and serum (for cytokine evaluation) should be collected at the time of progression, prior to starting any subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
The following procedures/assessments will be completed for subjects who are enrolled, but do not 
receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or anakinra, at the time points outlined in the SOA:
Subsequent therapy for the treatment of NHL
Survival status
Disease assessment per standard of care
Adverse/Serious Adverse Event reporting and concomitant medication documentation 
until [ADDRESS_825076] procedure (e.g., leukapheresis, lymphodepleting  chemotherapy). 
Should the subject fail to return to the clinic for a scheduled protocol specific visit, sites will need 
to make [ADDRESS_825077] an option to receive a second course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel without administration of anakinra prophylaxis under the following 
conditions:
Subject had no better than a PR 
Subjects disease subsequently progresses
CD19 tumor expression confirmed locally by [CONTACT_620355]-
treatment.  A portion of the biopsy should be sent to the central laboratory. 
Subject continues to meet the original study eligibility criteria with exception of prioraxicabtagene ciloleucel use in this study.  Screening assessments should be repeated if clinically indicated, as determined by [CONTACT_093], to confirm eligibility.
Subject has not received subsequent therapy for the treatment of lymphoma
Toxicities related to lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), with the exception of alopecia, have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or returned to baseline prior to re-treatment
There is a second infusion available from the patient’s original manufacturing.

57The decision to administer re-treatment should be made in consultation with the Sponsor.  In 
addition, a discussion regarding benefits and risks of retreatment and including the potential need to undergo leukapheresis a second time for the manufacturing of axicabtagene ciloleucel should occur with the subject prior to performing any study related procedures or treatment.  This conversation should also be recorded in the subject’s source document.  
A maximum of [ADDRESS_825078] been re-treated 
upon progression.  Three of the re-treated subjects (indolent lymphoma/leukemia) experienced durable responses to retreatment after an initial response and disease progression. Given limited experience with re-treatment, re-infusions will be censored from the primary end-point and efficacy outcomes will be analyzed separately.

Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 8.0 
(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).
13.1 Data Reporting
13.1.1 Method
The Office of Data Quality (ODQ) will collect, manage, and perform quality checks on the 
data for this study.
13.1.2 Responsibility for Data Submission
Investigative sites within DF/HCC or DF/PCC are responsible for submitting data and/or 
data forms to the Office of Data Quality (ODQ) in accordance with DF/HCC policies.
13.2 Data Safety Monitoring
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of medical oncologists, research nurses, pharmacists and biostatisticians with direct experience in cancer clinical research.  Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI, study team and Kite/[COMPANY_009]. The DSMC will review protocols up to, but not more than four times a year with the primary focus being accrual, protocol adherence, audit results and summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up. Given the collaborative nature of this protocol, there will be an an additional safety review team (SRT) comprised of the study sponsor/PI [INVESTIGATOR_620299]/[COMPANY_009] meant to review all study safety data and make recommendations on further study conduct as described below.  As both axicabtagene ciloleucel and anakinra are FDA approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_620324], the goal of the SRT will be to observe for unforeseen toxicities not previously observed in the initial phase I/II studies that led to FDA approval of both agents. Specific guidance as outlined in section 8.4.4. 
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year with the frequency determined by 
[CONTACT_159952]. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up-to-date participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_825093] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring within 30 days of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up; any response information; audit results, and a summary provided by [CONTACT_3476].

63The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of anakinra as preventative management 
of neurotoxicity.  Secondary objectives will include evaluate the impact of anakinra  as preventative management of CAR-T related CRS, to evaluate the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in combination with preventative anakinra in terms of DOR, ORR, PFS, and OS in comparison to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_620325]-1 study.
14.1 Study Endpoints
Primary Endpoint:
Rate and severity of neurotoxicity as per CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_825094] 30 days of 
infusion. 
Secondary Endpoints:
Rate and severity of CRS as per Lee [ADDRESS_825095] 30 days of infusion in 
comparison to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_620325]-1 study. 
Duration of response (DOR): Among subjects who experience an objective response, DOR is defined as the date of their first objective response to disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
[ADDRESS_825096] evaluable disease assessment date and their response will be noted as ongoing.
Objective response rate (ORR): ORR is defined as the incidence of either a complete 
response or a partial response by [CONTACT_472050] 
1.  All subjects that do not meet the criteria for an objective response by [CONTACT_620358]-responders.  
Progression-free Survival (PFS): PFS is defined as the time from the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per the revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
[ADDRESS_825097] evaluable disease assessment date.  
Overall survival (OS):  OS is defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
to the date of death.  Subjects who have not died by [CONTACT_620359].
Exploratory Endpoints:
Levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood
Levels of cytokines in serum and CSF
Incidence of anti-axicabtagene ciloleucel antibodies
Investigation of potential biomarker development based on assessment of blood cells, 
tumor cells and the proposed actions of the investigational product.

64Rates of CRS/NT based on grading used in Zuma-1 (i.e. Lee 2014 for CRS, and CTCAE 
version 4.03 for neurotoxicity) vs ASTCT consensus guidelines 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of prophylactic regimens or earlier 
interventions on the rate and severity of CRS and neurologic toxicities.  The assessment of ORR is a secondary objective, and the analysis will be descriptive. 
14.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration
The anticipated enrollment in this study is approximately 20 patients over a 2-year period. The 
goal is to accrue one patient/month to the study protocol over this period. 
With [ADDRESS_825098] 86% power to detect a decrease in the neurotoxicity rate from 
45% to 15% via a two-sided exact binomial test with a significance level of 0.05.  The secondary objectives of this study include analyses the rate and severity of CRS as well as efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, PFS, OS) and levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells and cytokines in the blood.
All subjects will be followed for survival for up to approximately [ADDRESS_825099] had the opportunity to be followed 
for 30 days, respectively.  
The rate of grade 2+ neurotoxicity will be evaluated using a Simon’s two-stage design. Initially, 8 
patients will be enrolled. If 3 or more of the initial 8 patients experience grade 2+ neurotoxicity, enrollment will be terminated early or dosing modification discussed. The probability of early termination is 0.78 if the true rate of grade 2+ neurotoxicity is 45% or higher. Otherwise, enrollment will continue to a total of 20 patients. The treatment will be considered promising if 5 or fewer of 20 patients experience grade 2+ neurotoxicity. The two-stage design provides 86% power to demonstrate that the treatment is associated with a favorable neurotoxicity rate if the true rate is 15%. In contrast, there is a 4% (alpha) probability of concluding that the treatment has a favorable neurotoxicity rate if the true rate is 45% or higher.
Safety Interim Analysis
The SRT will review AE and SAE information on a regular basis throughout subject treatment in

66In the event of changes in the safety management using steroids, sensitivity analyses will explore 
the effect of these changes on outcomes via stratification and/or adjustment for use of steroids in multivariable models.
14.[ADDRESS_825103] incidence rates of treatment-emergent CRS, neurologic toxicities, axicabtagene ciloleucel-related adverse events, and ORRs will be summarized. DOR, PFS, and OS will also be summarized. 
Analysis Subsets  
Full Analysis Set: the full analysis set will consist of all enrolled subjects and will be used for 
summaries of subject disposition.
Modified Intent to Treat Set (mITT): the modified intent to treat set will consist of all subjects 
enrolled and treated with the target dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel, 2 x 10
6 CAR T cells/kg (range 
1 x 106 to 2.4 x 106 CAR T cells/kg) and at least one dose of anakinra. This analysis set will be 
used for all efficacy analyses.
Safety Analysis Subset: The safety analysis subset is defined as all subjects treated with any dose 
of axicabtagene ciloleucel and at least one dose of anakinra. For retreated subjects, only the initial treatment will contribute to the safety analyses while events following retreatment will not be included in the safety analysis. 
Retreatment Subset: Separate safety and efficacy analyses will be conducted in subjects who are 
retreated. These analyses will include data from non-initial treatments and follow the inclusion criteria specified above for safety and efficacy analysis.  
Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments
This is a single arm, open-label study and subjects and investigators will be aware of treatment received.  Data handling procedures for the the study will be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and maintain the validity and credibility of the study.  These procedures will be outlined in the study statistical analysis plan and Trial Integrity Document.

78APPENDIX B
Revised IWG Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007)
Complete Remission (CR):  CR requires all of the following: 
Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-
related symptoms if present before therapy. 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphoma (large cell, mantle cell and follicular lymphomas are all typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid):  in subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown:  in subjects without a pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (≤ 1.[ADDRESS_825119] diameter if > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_825120] decreased to ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  
The spleen and/or liver, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on basis of physical exam or CT scan, must should be normal size on CT scan and not be palpable on physical examination and nodules thought to represent lymphoma must no longer be present.  
A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_330389].  The bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_620318].  The biopsy core sample must be a minimum of 20 mm in length. 
Partial Remission (PR): PR requires all of the following:
≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_825121] 2 perpendicular dimensions, should be from different regions of the body if possible and should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes if possible.  
No increase in size of nodes, liver or spleen and no new sites of disease.  
If multiple splenic and hepatic nodules are present, they must regress by ≥ 50% in the SPD.  There must be a > 50% decrease in the greatest transverse diameter for single nodules.   
Bone marrow is irrelevant for determination of a PR.  If patient has persistent bone marrow involvement and otherwise meets criteria for CR the patient will be considered a PR.
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphoma:  for subjects with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET scan was positive before therapy, the post-treatment PET scan should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  Note: in subjects with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated in subjects with one or at most two residual masses that have regressed by 50% on CT scan.

79Stable Disease (SD): 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD.  PET should be positive in typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphomas.
Progressive Disease: Defined by [CONTACT_37408]:  
≥ 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the products of at least two lymph nodes, or if a single node is involved at least a 50% increase in the product of the diameters of this one node.  
Appearance of a new lesion greater than 1.5 cm in any axis even if other lesions are decreasing in size
Greater than or equal to a 50% increase in size of splenic or hepatic nodules 
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis. 
Lesions should be PET positive in typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphomas unless the lesion is too small to be detected by [CONTACT_10052] (<1.[ADDRESS_825122])

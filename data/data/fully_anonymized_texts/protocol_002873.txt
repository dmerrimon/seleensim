NOTE : The VAX-MOM study is divided into 3 main aims/phases. Each aim/phase informs the 
next, and will be submitted separately for IRB approval, as we cannot predetermine details for 
each aim/phase until the prior aim/phase has been completed. Aim/phase 1 was previously 
submitted and approved. We are now (current protocol) on aim/phase 2, which is being 
submitted for single IRB review, with the University of [COMPANY_002]ster RSRB acting as the IRB of 
record for all study sites.  
 
1. PURPOSE OF STUDY (ALL AIMS/PHASES) 
 
Infants under 6 months of age are at increased risk of both influenza (flu) and pertussis 
disease, and pregnant women who get influenza are more likely than non-pregnant women to 
have serious complications, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], death, preterm labor and premature 
birth. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that women receive 
a flu vaccine in flu season, and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis 
(Tdap) vaccine during each pregnancy (ideally between 27-36 weeks) to lower the risk for flu 
and pertussis disease for both themselves and their infants. However, only half of pregnant 
women in the US receive a flu and Tdap vaccine, respectively; only 33% of women receive 
both vaccines. Lack of vaccination stems from a combination of patient (lack of knowledge, 
vaccine hesitancy), provider (suboptimal communication skills, missed opportunities), and 
system (e.g., lack of standing orders and patient reminders) factors. An effective intervention 
is needed to improve flu and Tdap vaccination rates for pregnant women. 
 
This multi-site project has four key aims/phases. Aim/Phase 1  is to measure baseline 
flu/Tdap vaccination coverage and provider knowledge, attitudes and behaviors for flu/Tdap 
vaccination in participating OB/GYN practices within 4 health systems in [LOCATION_001] and 
[LOCATION_004]. Aim/Phase 2  is to use a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) (practice-
level randomization) to measure the effect of a multi-component quality improvement (QI) 
intervention (VAX-MOM: training in communication, provider prompts, standing orders + 
feedback on rates) on vaccination rates and provider attitudes, and to measure costs of the 
intervention. Aim/Phase 3  is to develop a translational plan/toolkit for OB/GYN practices 
and health systems for maternal vaccination.

complications that lead to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Our group has shown that the average annual rate 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96256] 4.5 per 1000 among children 0 to 5 months of age.1,2

in VAX-MOM StudyFlu infection rates are similar in pregnant women to the general population, but pregnant 
women are at higher risk of severe flu complications, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017]3-6 
and are at increased risk of adverse perinatal and neonatal outcomes.7,8 According to CDC, 
from 1990–2016 infants <[ADDRESS_106438] 6 months of life had an age-specific 
pertussis incidence of 78 per 100,000; 43% of those with reported infection were 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].10 While infants start DTaP vaccine at 2 months and vaccination rates are high, 
they are not well protected until they complete their primary series at 6 months of age. 
 
Effectiveness of maternal vaccination  
A 2016 systematic review showed that maternal flu vaccination provided “substantial 
benefit for infants and mothers,”11 with reduced rates of preterm birth and low birth weight. 
Infants <6 months of age whose mothers had received flu vaccine had a 63% reduction in 
laboratory-confirmed flu and a 29% reduction in respi[INVESTIGATOR_96257]; mothers had a reduction of 36% in the rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_96258].12 
Maternal flu vaccination is 91.5% effective in preventing flu-associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96259].13 In a cohort study of mother-infant pairs, the rate of pertussis was 43% lower 
among infants whose mothers received prenatal Tdap than among infants whose mothers did 
not;14 protection was seen only among infants whose mothers received Tdap at >[ADDRESS_106439] serum concentrations of pertussis antibodies15 and, that 
maternal Tdap receipt at 30-32 weeks gestation was associated with significantly higher 
infant serum concentrations of Tdap antibodies at birth and 2 months of age.16 
 
Barriers to Vaccination 
There are many barriers to influenza and Tdap vaccination for pregnant women. Our 
team has conceptualized these barriers into a widely used model; the VAX-MOM study will 
address multiple components by [CONTACT_96300], prompts 
and/or standing orders, provider feedback, and patient education/reminders to overcome 
these barriers (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 4 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 Patient Barriers  include vaccine hesitancy, lack of knowledge of the benefits and risks of 
flu or Tdap vaccine or protection for the baby, concerns about vaccine safety generally and 
during pregnancy, low perceived susceptibility to infection, and lack of access.17,18 
Vaccination rates are lower for younger women, Blacks, those with public insurance, lower 
income, and inadequate prenatal care.19,20-22 Provider Barriers  include missed opportunities 
for vaccination, lack of a vaccine recommendation or weak endorsements by [CONTACT_96301] (the most important predictor in many studies),19,20-22  various 
suboptimal practice operations, insufficient knowledge, financial barriers, and lack of 
reminder recall.23,24,25 System Barriers  include the lack of a tracking or reminder system, as 
well as suboptimal staff training, and challenges with vaccine purchase and storage.22,26

 4. STUDY DESIGN & PROCEDURES ( AIM/PHASE 2 ONLY ) 
 
Brief Overview of Aim/Phase 2:   
Using a clustered RCT (randomizing practices), we will allocate half of the practices within each 
health system to the VAX-MOM intervention and the other half to standard of care. We will 
measure the impact of the intervention on vaccination rates (primary outcomes) and missed 
opportunities and process metrics (secondary outcomes) (see Table 4). Finally, if VAX-MOM is 
successful, we will provide the control practices the intervention during Year 3.   
 
Design and Procedural Details of Aim/Phase 2: (also see Figure 2 for Timeline) 
 
Step 1) Deliver VAX-MOM training/intervention to randomized practices: 
 
Randomization Details:   
Practices will be the unit of randomization. We will assign practices using a covariate 
constrained randomization strategy as follows: First, we will use data from Aim #[ADDRESS_106443] the primary outcomes. We will perform 
constrained randomization to allocate practices within each health system to 
intervention/control arms and ensure each arm has similar baseline flu and Tdap 
vaccination rates, percent of patients covered by [CONTACT_5556], number of OB providers, and 
number of patients. Specifically, we will use these variables to construct and evaluate a 
balance criterion, which is the sum of the squared difference between standardized group 
means on these variables. We will generate randomization separately by [CONTACT_96304]. 
We will generate all possible combinations of eligible practices in 2 arms (using a SAS 
macro), and define an acceptable set of randomizations that result in balanced variables 
(generally the lowest 10% on the balance criterion). From this set of randomizations, we 
will select one set at random, and then randomly assign each practice to intervention vs 
control group.  
 
Intervention Details:  
Once randomization has been completed, and “intervention group” practices have been 
identified, multiple quality improvement (QI) techniques will be aimed at practice 
providers, nurses, and staff.  
 
 Identification of “vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” at each intervention site:  At each site, 
the affiliated medical director will select one “vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” for the practice. 
Each identified vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96267] e-mailed an Information Sheet (see 
“InformationSheetVaccineChampi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]…”  document) by [CONTACT_96305], outlining the basic study goals as well as their involvement in tasks 
throughout the training and intervention adoption phases of the study (see 
“Consent Process” section). The position of vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96268], and if 
they do not wish to accept the role, they may decline and another individual will 
be identified by [CONTACT_96306]. The vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96269] a 
lead role throughout the study intervention, including: 
Page 9 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 o assisting with the dissemination of e-learning training modules and the 
scheduling of a follow-up site-specific meeting 
o acting to ensure training content is being appropriately adopted into 
practice workflow procedures 
o fielding questions from site personnel regarding the logistics of study 
interventions  
o acting as an ongoing liaison between the site personnel and study staff 
o leading bi-monthly discussions regarding immunization rate feedback with site personnel (see step 2 for further detail) 
o planning for and completing monthly PDSA cycles (see step 2 for further 
detail) 
o monthly completion of the “Practice Time/Cost Survey” (see step 4 for 
further detail) 
 
 Delivery/discussion of training modules : Each site will receive training focused 
on 3 main areas of content (see Table 3). This training will be delivered first via 
an online e-learning platform, and next via an in-person or virtual site meeting.

Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 o E-learning platform: Module content will first be disseminated to practice 
site personnel via an online e-learning platform (i.e., Articulate). Study 
coordinators will obtain e-mail addresses for the site personnel from either 
the health system liaison or the associated vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and will then 
e-mail a training content link to all appropriate site providers, nurses, and 
staff. Attached to this initial e-mail will be an Information Sheet 
describing the study goals and training phase details, as well as their 
involvement throughout the duration of the 12-month QI intervention (see 
“TrainingPhaseEmail…”  and “ InformationSheetTrainingPhase… ” 
documents; also see “Consent Process” section for more detail). After 
reviewing the Information Sheet and discussing any questions/concerns 
with study staff, site personnel will be asked to access and complete the 
training lessons prior to their scheduled site meeting.  
 
Embedded at the conclusion of the online training module, will be a link to 
a brief REDCap survey (see “TrainingModuleCompletionSurvey…”  
document) to obtain information regarding those who have fully 
completed the training. A list of practice personnel who have successfully 
completed the online training will be stored in a password-protected 
Excel/Word file by [CONTACT_96307]. The names will not be linked 
with any other study data. The list will be accessible only by [CONTACT_96308]/CNE 
credit.  
 
Note: For intervention sites that have completed the e-learning training 
during the first half of the calendar year (i.e., prior to July), site personnel 
may be asked to additionally complete an abbreviated “flu booster” e-
learning module just prior to flu season of that same year (e.g., in 
Aug/Sept). This abbreviated version (approx. 15 minutes to complete) will 
contain content (see table 3) only applicable to influenza.  
 
o Site Meeting: Following the online training, all site personnel will meet with study staff either in-person or via a virtual Zoom meeting. The 
meetings (both virtual and in-person) will be audio and video recorded 
using a laptop or handheld recording device (in-person meetings) or via 
the Zoom recording option (virtual meetings) (see “Audio/Video 
Recording” and “Privacy and Confidentiality” sections for more detail). 
These archived video files will allow for the review of meeting content by 
[CONTACT_96309], or by [CONTACT_96310] a second time. 
 
During the site meeting, study staff will briefly review online training 
content, allow time for the sharing of comments/questions from site 
personnel, and lead a discussion regarding the application of training 
content ideas specifically to that practice site. During this meeting, study 
staff will also present site personnel with their current immunization rates. 
Page 12 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.[ADDRESS_106444]-protected 
Excel/Word file. The names will not be linked with any other study data. 
This list will be accessed for the purposes of confirming those who should 
receive MOC credit. 
 
Note: For intervention sites that have completed their site meeting during 
the first half of the calendar year (i.e., prior to July), site personnel may be 
asked to participate in a second abbreviated “flu booster” site meeting just 
prior to flu season of that same year (e.g., in Aug/Sept). This abbreviated 
meeting (approx. 15 minutes) will discuss content (see table 3) only 
applicable to influenza.  
 
o MOC/CME/CNE Credit: To encourage the completion of online trainings and the attendance at site meetings, providers and nurses will be offered 
CME/CNE credit for completing learning modules, and MOC/QI credit 
for attending office systems change meetings and reviewing practice rates.  
 
Step 2) Monitor adoption of VAX-MOM training content at randomized practices: 
 
To monitor the adoption of VAX-MOM training content (changes in communication 
techniques, workflow optimization, etc.) at each practice site, each vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96271]: 
 
1. Lead a discussion regarding immunization rate feedback  with practice providers, 
nurses, and staff on a bi-monthly basis (every-other month). The champi[INVESTIGATOR_96272] (e.g., Ob/Gyn, nurse, desk staff, etc.) within the practice.  They will e-mail 
study staff with a list of individual attendees for the purposes of tracking those 
receiving MOC credit. They will also report aggregate numbers on a monthly 
basis using the “Practice Time & Cost Survey.”  
 
The site-specific flu and Tdap vaccination rates will be obtained from either: 1) 
the EHR report builders for each health system ( possible for all 4 health 
systems ), or 2) manual chart review ( possible for only NY health systems ). 
Obtained rates will be sent either via secure e-mail directly to the study 
coordinator in each corresponding state, or uploaded to the secure shared Box 
folder. The study coordinator will then disseminate the vaccination rates for each 
site to all corresponding site personnel (see “RateFeedbackTemplate…” 
document).  
 
2. Develop PDSA cycles/goals  on a monthly basis utilizing knowledge about current workflow efficiency and data from vaccine rate reports. Vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96273] (see  “PDSASurvey…” document) to guide progress 
with their respective teams. The template will help them decide upon specific 
Page 13 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 intervention activities appropriate for their setting, track those involved with each 
activity, compare results from the activity to previous performance, and focus on 
changes that may need implementation during future cycles. PDSA cycle logs 
will be shared with study staff via a secure REDCap survey (same 
“PDSASurvey…” document formatted on the REDCap platform) sent to the 
vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96274]. 
 
During the final quarter of the 12-month intervention phase, a study team 
member will observe a subset of NY intervention sites in-person in order to 
collect qualitative data regarding workflow and communication techniques as 
described in the sites’ submitted PDSA cycle logs. Specifically, the study team 
member will observe select OB/GYN practice nurses and staff for 1-2 days per 
site, and will document the ways in which the targeted intervention techniques 
are implemented within the practice (see “ InterventionObservationNotes …” 
document). Observation notes will then be compared with submitted PDSA cycle 
log information and analyzed for consistency.  
 
Of Note : Although study staff will observe OB/GYN practice nurses and staff 
during patient encounters, practice patients will NOT be the target of the 
observation, and no identifying patient information will be collected. Rather, the 
focus of observation will be the select practice personnel only. Any patient-level 
information recorded during the observation will be done so in a generic manner 
such that the patient could not be identified on the basis of the notes (e.g., 
“…when patient indicated that they did not want a Tdap vaccine, the nurse 
stated, ‘The doctor may talk to you more about that when she comes in.’” ). The 
study staff will only observe the initial nurse/staff interaction with the patient, 
and will not continue to observe once the provider (doctor or midwife) enters for 
the visit.          
 
3. Complete the “Practice Time/Cost Survey”  on a monthly basis (see step 4 for further detail).  
 
To monitor study staff effort during this phase, study staff will participate in the 
following activity in an ongoing basis: 
 
4. Complete the  “Study Staff Time/Cost Survey”  on a monthly basis (see step 4 for 
further detail). 
 
 
 
Step 3) Compare intervention vs. control practices: 
 
Using the “RE-AIM” framework (see Table 4) we will compare intervention practices to 
control practices using multiple data sources. We will focus on one primary outcome and 
multiple secondary outcomes. 
 
Primary Outcome: Following the conclusion of aim/phase 2 (12-month duration), we will 
assess the “Effectiveness” of the intervention by [CONTACT_96311]. 
 
Page 14 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 Secondary Outcomes: Following the conclusion of aim/phase 2 (12-month duration), we 
will assess the remaining “RE-AIM” domains including “Reach,” “Adoption,” 
“Implementation,” and “Maintenance.”

Details for EHR data extraction:  
 Measure Description (also see “EHRDataExtraction …”  document) 
We will work with our experienced UCLA analysts (initial planning of required data 
fields and subsequent analysis of data output) and health system report builders 
(algorithm development) to extract EHR data for the purposes of evaluating basic flu and 
Tdap vaccination rates and additional secondary outcomes (see Table 5).

 Measure Procedures 
 
Each health system (URMC, RRH, UCLA, and LADHS) will have its own “report 
builder.” The report builder will be in charge of collecting the electronic health record 
(EHR) data from their own health system and putting it into a format (report) that can be 
easily understood and analyzed by [CONTACT_464]. 
 
Bi-Monthly Feedback Reports : The report builder for each health system will create 
vaccine rate feedback reports utilizing extracted EHR data for intervention sites on a bi-
monthly basis. These reports will be sent either via secure e-mail directly to the study 
coordinator in each corresponding state, or uploaded to the secure shared Box folder. The 
study coordinator will then disseminate the vaccination rates for each site to all 
corresponding site personnel. 
 
For NY health systems, in the event an automated EHR feedback report cannot be 
generated in time for any given month, the identified vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96275]. All vaccine 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_19035]/or study personnel conducting manual chart review will have completed 
all appropriate eRecord training prior to accessing patient charts. Of those patients who 
delivered during the identified month, at least 20% will be reviewed. For each chart 
reviewed, the vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96276] (or lack 
thereof) of influenza and Tdap immunization as well as Covid vaccination when possible, 
and will share results with the study team via secure e-mail.  
 
Final EHR Data Analysis : Additionally, at the conclusion of aim/phase 2 (12-month 
duration) each health system report builder will create a final EHR report for both the 
intervention sites as well as the control sites capturing updated baseline information from 
2019 and 2020 (now needed due to COVID pause), as well as detailed intervention 
information from 2021 and 2022 (information indicated in Table 5 that was not captured 
during monthly reports). These final reports will be uploaded to a shared folder on the 
secure Box platform, accessible by [CONTACT_96313] (EHR report builders, Drs. Cindy 
Rand and Peter Szilagyi, and Study Coordinators) and the UCLA data analysis team. This 
report will allow for the comparison of vaccination rates and secondary outcomes Table 5. EHR Data Extraction Categories 
Primary  Flu vaccines received during flu season (Sept-April)  
 Tdap vaccine s received  during 27 -36 weeks of pregnancy  
Secondary  Vaccine refusal (as documented in EHR)

 between intervention and control sites. In the event that the final automated EHR reports 
cannot be generated in a timely manner by [CONTACT_96314], study personnel and/or a 
medical student (after being added to the study protocol) will conduct manual EHR chart 
reviews to collect the data. They will be appropriately trained in the EHR system 
requiring access, prior to conducting the chart reviews.  
 
Details for Provider & Nurse Survey:  
 Measure Description 
The Provider & Nurse Survey (see “ProviderNurseSurvey…”  document) is an 86-
question survey consisting of Likert scale, multi-option and open-ended questions. The 
survey takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. The survey assesses opi[INVESTIGATOR_96277], Tdap and COVID-19 vaccinations, patient refusal of those vaccinations, 
barriers to those vaccinations, policies and procedures within provider offices as they 
relate to vaccinations, and basic demographic information. 
 
 Measure Procedures 
At the conclusion of aim/phase 2, all providers (MD, residents, NPs, PAs and CNMs) and 
select nurses from both the intervention and control sites will be asked to complete the 
survey. Surveys will be e-mailed (see “ProviderNurseSurveyInviteEmail…”  document) 
to providers and select nurses by [CONTACT_96315], using the secure web 
application REDCap. E-mail addresses will have previously been obtained from the 
health system liaisons or vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96278]. An Information Sheet (see “Consent Process” section for more 
details) will be embedded in each e-mail. 
 
After initial survey distribution, if the subject does not click on the survey link embedded 
within the e-mail, the REDCap platform will automatically disseminate a reminder e-mail 
to the subject (identical content as initial invite e-mail). They will receive this reminder e-
mail every [ADDRESS_106445] clicks on the 
survey link, they will be redirected to the secure survey site where they may answer 
survey questions at their own pace. Subjects may stop and restart at any time, and may 
skip any questions they do not wish to answer. At the conclusion of the survey, they will 
receive an automated confirmation message to assure them that the process is complete. 
 
Details for Practice Culture Survey:  
 Measure Description  
The Practice Culture Survey (see “PracticeCultureSurvey…”  document) is a 15-item 
Likert scale survey which takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. The survey 
assesses opi[INVESTIGATOR_96279], decision making, stress/chaos and leadership 
domains within a practice site. 
 
 Measure Procedures 
At the conclusion of aim/phase 2, select providers (MD, residents, NPs, PAs and CNMs), 
nurses and staff from the intervention sites will be asked to complete the survey. Surveys 
will be e-mailed (see “PracticeCultureSurveyInviteEmail…”  document) to personnel by 
[CONTACT_3490] 17 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.[ADDRESS_106446] previously been obtained from the health system liaisons or vaccine 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_96280]. An 
Information Sheet (see “Consent Process” section for more details) will be embedded in 
each e-mail. 
 
After initial survey distribution, if the subject does not click on the survey link embedded 
within the e-mail, the REDCap platform will automatically disseminate a reminder e-mail 
to the subject (identical content as initial invite e-mail). They will receive this reminder e-
mail every [ADDRESS_106447] clicks on the 
survey link, they will be redirected to the secure survey site where they may answer 
survey questions at their own pace. Subjects may stop and restart at any time, and may 
skip any questions they do not wish to answer. At the conclusion of the survey, they will 
receive an automated confirmation message to assure them that the process is complete. 
 
Step 4) Evaluate cost of the VAX-MOM intervention: 
 
Practice Time & Cost Survey (see “PracticeTime&CostSurvey…”  document): A survey aimed at evaluating the amount of time and money devoted to VAX-MOM intervention 
activities will be sent by [CONTACT_96316][INVESTIGATOR_96281] a monthly basis. The survey will be completed by [CONTACT_96317][INVESTIGATOR_96282]/cost estimates pertaining to the month prior. 
 
Study Staff Time & Cost Survey (see “StudyStaffTime&CostSurvey…”  document): A 
survey aimed at evaluating the time and cost efforts of VAX-MOM study staff will be 
sent to study personnel on a weekly basis via REDCap. 
 
Final Time & Cost Analysis:  
Upon completion of aim/phase [ADDRESS_106448] a final time/cost analysis. Our two-fold 
cost measures are (a) total intervention cost to implement the VAX-MOM program 
aggregated at the four health-system level under a cost analysis and (b) cost per 
additional flu or Tdap vaccination under a subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis.

During aim/phase 2, we will utilize subjects from a total of 37 participating practices across 
both NY and CA. “Subjects” refers to both a) the providers, nurses, and staff at the participating 
OB/GYN practice sites and b) data from practice patients (pregnant women) gathered via 
electronic health record (EHR). A list of all participating practices and corresponding 
demographic information is below (Table 6).

Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
Every effort will be made within this project to ensure that women, racial and ethnic 
minorities will be included in all aspects of the research. Practices selected from two states 
include a broad spectrum of size, regional location as well as public and private practices. 
These variables will ensure racial/ethnic diversity among study subjects that will mirror the 
state of [LOCATION_001] and [LOCATION_004]’s racial and ethnic distribution as shown in the enrollment 
table. In [LOCATION_001] and [LOCATION_004], an estimated 57% of Obstetrician/Gynecologists are 
female. Therefore, we anticipate a slightly higher percentage of females among the provider 
study subjects. Patient study subjects will all be female.  
 
Inclusion of Pregnant Women 
Although the research project involves OB/GYN practice sites, study staff will not have 
direct contact [CONTACT_96318], nor do study efforts place the patients’ pregnancy at 
risk. All pregnant patients, at both the intervention and control sites, will continue to receive 
their expected standard of care for the entirety of their pregnancy. 
 
Page 21 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 Inclusion of Children 
Pregnant patients receiving care at eligible practices will be considered part of the study 
population. As the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends 
influenza and Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, the intervention, performed by [CONTACT_96319], will include pregnant patients that are aged less than 
[ADDRESS_106452] upon: performance evaluations, job 
advancement, or the loss/gain of benefits (e.g., salary increases, time off).  
 
6. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA & RECRUITMENT METHODS  
 
All Participating Sites (Intervention & Control) During aim/phase 1 of the study, health systems (URMC/RRH/UCLA/LADHS) within 
each state were chosen because a) their size allowed for an ample sampling of patients 
and practitioners (i.e., large subject pool) and b) they allowed for a broad spectrum of 
geographic and socio-economic diversity (e.g., privately and publicly insured, ethnic 
multiplicity, rural and urban locations, etc.). Prior to the start of the project, Drs. Rand 
and Szilagyi contact[CONTACT_96320], and letters of support were 
obtained (see attached Letters of Support for each system).  
    
Intervention Sites 
As described in the “Randomization” subsection of the “Study Design & Procedures” 
portion of the protocol, study sites from the larger pool were selected to be part of the 
“intervention group” using specific constrained randomization procedures within each 
health system (see section 4 of protocol for more details). All remaining sites were 
allocated to the “control group.” 
 
Practice-Level Personnel 
 
Criteria/Recruitment Method for Vaccine Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]: 
At each site, the affiliated medical director will select one “vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” for the 
practice. The vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96283] a 
lead role throughout the study intervention, including their ability to complete all 
monthly and bi-monthly tasks listed in “Step 1” of the “Study Design and Procedures” 
section. The position of vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96268], and if they do not wish to accept 
the role, they may decline and another individual will be identified by [CONTACT_96321]. 
 
Criteria/Recruitment Method for Remaining Site Personnel: 
By [CONTACT_15094] (and with the support of health system and practice site leaders) all remaining 
providers, nurses, and practice staff employed by [CONTACT_96322], are able to 
participate in the quality improvement initiative. 
Page 22 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 Patient-Level Study Subjects 
 
Criteria for EHR Data from Practice Patients (Pregnant Women): 
Baseline vaccine rates for each practice site were established during aim/phase 1 of the 
study, and contained EHR information from practice patients who were identified as 
having a live birth within the time period of summer 2018 to summer 2019. Due to a 
COVID-19 related pause in study activity, updated baseline vaccine rates will also be 
obtained during aim/phase 2 for the 2019-2020 time period. All subjects are female and 
some are <18 years of age.  
 
To establish vaccine rates for the ongoing feedback reports, EHR information will be collected bi-monthly (every 2 months) from intervention sites during the entirety of the 
intervention phase (see timeline depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 2). EHR information will reflect 
practice patients who are identified as being eligible for flu or Tdap vaccine within the 
specified 2-month time period. Again, all subjects will be female and may be <18 years 
of age.  
 
To establish the final vaccine data reports (for intervention vs. control comparison), detailed EHR information (see Table 5) will be collected from both intervention and 
control sites for the 2021-2022 time period. 
 
7. CONSENT PROCESS 
 
Health System, Practice Site, & Site Personnel Level  
 
Health System & Practice Site Consent: 
 
Health System support (and subsequently site-level support) was previously obtained 
during aim/phase 1 of the study, as described in the “Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria & 
Recruitment Methods” section of the protocol.  
 
Site Personnel Consent:   
Delivery of Training Content & Involvement in 12-Month QI Intervention  
(All site personnel: completion of e-learning module, attendance of follow-up site 
meeting, and participation in monthly/bi-monthly discussions of rate feedback and 
PDSA cycles)  
 
This study involves commonly accepted quality improvement efforts aimed to 
improve upon the standard of care in medical settings, such as the completion of 
e-learning modules and in-person trainings specifically related to practice goals, 
the review of practice metrics (vaccine rates) by [CONTACT_8786], discussion of 
office workflow procedures/efficacy, and trainings in optimal communication 
techniques.  
 
We are therefore seeking a waiver of documentation of consent and a waiver of 
HIPAA authorization  for the training portion of the study. More specifically, we 
are requesting this waiver because: a) the training portion of the study is no 
Page 23 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 greater than minimal risk, b) the purpose of the study/intervention and a basic 
framework of the trainings will be clearly outlined for participants in the 
Information Sheet (see “InformationSheetTrainingPhase…”  document) e-mailed 
to them at the onset of the intervention phase, c) ample time will be given to 
personnel to review the Information Sheet in full and ask questions of study staff 
regarding the quality improvement effort and/or specific tasks involved in the 
training phase, and  d) PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or 
entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) for authorized oversight of the research 
study, or (iii) for other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be 
permitted by [CONTACT_36869]. 
 
We will attach an Information Sheet (cited above) to the first e-learning invite e-
mail, describing the study goals and training phase details, as well as site 
personnel involvement throughout the duration of the 12-month QI intervention 
(e-mailed to site personnel just prior to the training phase). Study staff will field 
any and all questions from potential study subjects prior to their module training 
and subsequent site meeting.  
 
Assessment of Intervention Adoption: Surveys & Rate Feedback  (Selected Vaccine Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]: completion of bi-monthly rate feedback 
discussions and monthly PDSA cycles and Practice Time & Cost Surveys) 
 
The assessment of intervention adoption by [CONTACT_96323] a medical setting, including the ongoing review of 
practice metrics (vaccine rate feedback sessions), the development and assessment 
of practice goals (PDSA Cycles), and the evaluation of personnel efforts to 
achieve these goals (Time & Cost Survey).  
 
We are therefore seeking a waiver of documentation of consent and a waiver of 
HIPAA authorization  for the training portion of the study. More specifically, we 
are requesting this waiver because: a) the assessment portion of the study is no 
greater than minimal risk, b) the purpose of the study/intervention and a 
description of the assessment tasks will be clearly outlined for vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96284] (see “InformationSheetVaccineChampi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]…” document) 
e-mailed to them at the onset of the assessment phase, c) ample time will be given 
to each vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96285]/or specific 
tasks involved in the assessment phase, and  d) PHI will not be reused or disclosed 
to any other person or entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) for authorized 
oversight of the research study, or (iii) for other research for which the use or 
disclosure of PHI would be permitted by [CONTACT_36869]. 
 
As soon as they are selected, each identified vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96267] e-mailed 
(see “VaccineChampi[INVESTIGATOR_96286]…”  document) an Information Sheet (cited above) 
by [CONTACT_96324], outlining the basic study goals as well as 
their involvement in tasks throughout the training and intervention adoption 
Page 24 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.[ADDRESS_106453]. The position of vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96268], and if they do not wish to accept the role, they may decline and another individual will be identified by [CONTACT_96325]. 
 
Assessment of Intervention Adoption: In-Person Observation  (Select Nurses and Staff: observation of workflow and communication techniques) 
 
The in-person observation of intervention adoption involves commonly occurring 
procedures within a medical setting, including the ongoing documentation and 
review of daily workflow and communication procedures.  
 
We are therefore seeking a waiver of documentation of consent and a waiver of 
HIPAA authorization  for the in-person observation portion of the study. More 
specifically, we are requesting this waiver because: a) the observation portion of 
the study is no greater than minimal risk, b) the purpose of the observation will be 
clearly outlined for nurses and staff in the Information Sheet (see 
“InformationSheetInPersonObs…”  document) e-mailed to them prior to the 
scheduled observation, c) ample time will be given to each nurse/staff to review 
the Information Sheet in full and ask questions of study staff regarding the 
observation, and  d) PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or 
entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) for authorized oversight of the research 
study, or (iii) for other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be 
permitted by [CONTACT_36869]. 
 
Prior to in-person observation, the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_25733]’s 
vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96287] 1-2 days that would be optimal for study staff to 
be onsite. Once the observation schedule has been determined, all nurses and staff 
who are scheduled to work on the specified day(s) will be e-mailed an 
Information Sheet (see “InformationSheetInPersonObs…”  document) by [CONTACT_33662], which they may review at their own pace prior to the 
observation date. They may e-mail the project coordinator with any questions, or 
bring questions to the attention of the study staff on the scheduled visit day prior 
to the start of any observation. The content of the Information Sheet will be 
reviewed again by [CONTACT_96326]/staff on the visit day prior to 
the start of any documented observation (any nurses/staff not previously known to 
be working that day will be given a hard copy of the Information Sheet upon 
arrival by [CONTACT_96327]). 
 
As stated previously, although study staff will observe OB/GYN practice nurses 
and staff during patient encounters, practice patients will NOT be the target of the 
observation, and no patient information (in either individual or aggregate form) 
will be collected. Rather, the focus of observation will be the select practice 
personnel only. Information recorded during the observation session will be 
Page 25 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 written in a generic manner such that specific nurses/staff/patients will not be 
identifiable. Notes will describe the general workflow processes and 
communication methods used, rather than specific unique behaviors or exact 
dialogue. For example, study staff may document “…when patient declined to 
receive the Tdap vaccine, the practice nurse gave them an informational handout 
and told them the doctor may speak with them further .” The study staff will only 
observe the initial nurse/staff interaction with the patient, and will not continue to 
observe once the provider (doctor or midwife) enters for the visit. Although the 
patient is not the study subject, prior to each observation, study staff will explain to the patient in simple language the purpose of the observation (i.e., to take notes 
regarding the nurse/staff work routine), and any patient that communicates 
discomfort or preference to not be observed, will not be observed.           
 
Provider & Nurse Survey and Culture Survey Dissemination  
We are seeking a waiver of documentation of consent and a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization  for the Provider & Nurse Survey and Culture Survey portion of the 
study. We are doing so because: a) the surveys are no greater than minimal risk (a 
brief online survey with unobtrusive questions), b) a detailed Information Sheet 
(see “InformationSheetProviderNurseSurvey…”  and 
“InformationSheetPracticeCultureSurvey…”  documents) will be made available 
to each subject prior to the start of the survey, c) ample time will be given to each 
subject to consider participation (subjects are notified of the survey via e-mail and 
can review the information sheet and/or ask questions of study staff for as long as 
necessary before deciding about survey completion), d) no identifiers will be 
included on the survey form (only subject IDs), and the separate document linking 
subject name [CONTACT_96343] a limited number of 
study staff, will be kept under double-locked conditions, and will be destroyed 
three years after study completion, and e) PHI will not be reused or disclosed to 
any other person or entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) for authorized 
oversight of the research study, or (iii) for other research for which the use or 
disclosure of PHI would be permitted by [CONTACT_36869].  
 
Patient (EHR) Level  
 
EHR Data Extraction:  We are seeking a waiver of consent and a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization  for the EHR data extraction portion of the study. We are doing so because: 
a) we believe that this research cannot be practicably conducted without such a waiver, as 
we cannot feasibly obtain consent and HIPAA authorization from all potential subjects 
(10,000+ in total subject pool), b) site liaisons and report builders have routine access to 
patient records, c) a minimal number of patient-level data fields will be extracted from 
the EHR (just enough to complete analysis) d) a plan to protect EHR data during all data 
transfers will be implemented (see “Privacy & Confidentiality” section for details), e) any 
individual-level data will be destroyed three years after study completion, and f) PHI will 
not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) 
Page 26 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 for authorized oversight of the research study, or (iii) for other research for which the use 
or disclosure of PHI would be permitted by [CONTACT_36869]. 
 
8. AUDIO/VIDEO RECORDINGS  
 
All site meetings (both virtual and in-person) held during the training phase may be audio 
and/or video recorded using a laptop or handheld recording device (in-person meetings) or 
via the Zoom recording option (virtual meetings) (see “Privacy and Confidentiality” section 
for more detail). These archived audio/video files will allow for the review of meeting 
content by [CONTACT_96309], or by [CONTACT_96328] a second time. 
 
The archived site meeting audio/video files will be stored on a secure Box platform, 
accessible only to study staff and site personnel from the corresponding practice site (each 
site will have their own Box folder ensuring meetings from other sites are not viewable to 
outside personnel). Invites to the secure Box folder will be e-mailed from study coordinators 
directly to site personnel. As soon as the video files have been uploaded to the secure Box 
platform, they will be deleted from the laptop or handheld recording device. Once the study 
has been fully completed, all video files will be deleted from the shared Box folder.  
 
9.   RISKS TO SUBJECTS 
 
Practice Level Risk: This project involves  QI trainings/interventions which aim to improve 
upon the existing communication techniques and workflow procedures at each intervention 
practice site. Planned study trainings/interventions are widely accepted among medical 
practices (e.g., practice providers/nurses/staff attending an informational meeting regarding 
the risk of influenza in the pregnant population), and do not involve any novel high-risk 
changes to practice structure or procedures. Practice sites in the control group will continue 
to utilize “best-practice” guidelines. Thus, at the practice level, anticipated overall study risk 
is very low.  
 
Site Personnel & Patient Level Risk: The primary risk to site personnel and practice 
patients is the risk of a breach of confidentiality, though overall risk remains low.  
 
To reduce risk, personal information being collected from site personnel or practice patients 
(EHR data) has been minimized, and when possible is being collected in aggregate form.  
 
A number of policies, procedures, and technical safeguards (described in the “Privacy & 
Confidentiality” section of this protocol) will be in place to ensure that there is no breach of 
confidentiality as a result of this study.

 10.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS 
 
Practice personnel will receive targeted training related to: influenza and pertussis disease as 
it pertains to the pregnant population, communication, and optimization of office workflow 
as it relates to the improvement of immunization rates within their practice. As such, practice 
personnel who participate in both the training and ongoing QI portions of the study will have 
the opportunity to apply for MOC, CME, or CNE credit. 
 
There are no anticipated benefits for practice patients beyond those inherent to the 
overarching study goals (i.e., an improvement in flu and Tdap immunization rates). 
 
11.  COSTS FOR PARTICIPATION  
 
There will be no costs incurred by [CONTACT_4317].  
 
12.  PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  
 
For completing each “PDSA Cycle” survey and “Practice Time & Cost” survey, each vaccine 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_96288] $5. Payment will be in the form of a gift card or check, and will be mailed 
to the vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96289] 12 month intervention phase. Payment made 
will be the cumulative total of all completed monthly surveys (12 PDSA surveys + 12 Time & 
Cost surveys = 24 total surveys), for a maximum payout of $120 (24 surveys x $5 = $120). 
Additionally, if manual chart review is necessary for any NY practice sites, each vaccine 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_96288] $[ADDRESS_106454] online survey. This address information will be accessible only by [CONTACT_464], and will 
be deleted as soon as the payment has been mailed. 
 
For completing the “Provider & Nurse Survey” portion of the study, each subject will receive 
$40. For completing the “Practice Culture Survey” portion of the study, each subject will receive 
$10. For both surveys, payment will be in the form of a gift card or check, and will be mailed or 
e-mailed to the subject within 6 weeks of survey completion. Subjects will enter their home 
address and e-mail information into a secure REDCap field at the beginning of each online 
survey. This information will be accessible only by [CONTACT_464], and will be deleted as soon as the 
payment has been sent. 
 
Additionally, subjects completing the above surveys will be entered into a drawing for a $[ADDRESS_106455] 
information collected in the address/e-mail field of their REDCap survey.

Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 For serving as an intervention site, a single practice-level payment will be offered in the amount 
of $250. This payment will be in the form of a gift card or check, and will be disseminated to the 
vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96290]. Payment may be used for any practice-wide 
item(s) deemed beneficial by [CONTACT_96317][INVESTIGATOR_2394]. If manual chart review is necessary at a 
practice site (and thus additional payment to the vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96291]), the $[ADDRESS_106456] WITHDRAWALS 
 
During aim/phase 1 of this study (August 2019-July 2020) all health systems and affiliated 
practice sites agreed to participate in this quality improvement effort. While we do not anticipate 
a high level of subject/site withdrawals, any site wishing to end their involvement in the quality 
improvement initiative may do so at any time. Any practice personnel wishing to abstain from 
participation in quality improvement activities (trainings, ongoing meetings, adoption of new 
workflow procedures) are free to do so. Any vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96292] 12 month intervention period, will still receive payment for 
all completed surveys prior to their withdrawal. All subjects (practice personnel) are free to 
discontinue participation at any time, without consequence.  
 
14.  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBJECTS AND RESEARCH DATA 
 
The following data collection and storage procedures will be implemented at each study site, to 
ensure that subject privacy and confidentiality are maintained throughout the entirety of the 
research process:  
 
Data obtained via e-mail and REDCap during the training phase: 
(Site personnel names collected during the e-learning modules and site meetings) 
 
Study coordinators will maintain a list of site personnel who have successfully completed 
their e-learning modules and who attended follow-up site meetings.  These names will be 
obtained via e-mails from the vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_19035]/or REDCap surveys. The lists will be 
stored in password protected Excel/Word files on a password protected computer for the 
purposes of confirming requests for MOC, CME and CNE credit. No additional study 
information (e.g., future survey responses) will be contained within this file.  All files will be stored on a secure server within each university system (URMC/UCLA). These individual-
level training completion files will be deleted once they are no longer necessary (i.e., once all 
credit applications are in). Only aggregate data, not individual names, will be stored long-
term by [CONTACT_96329] (i.e., 
the total number of providers, nurses, and staff who did/didn’t complete the training).  
 
Data Obtained via REDCap during the intervention adoption & assessment phase: 
(PDSA cycles, Time & Cost Surveys, Provider & Nurse Survey, Practice Culture Survey) 
 
For study measures completed via a REDCap survey, all subject names and corresponding e-
mail addresses will first be collected by [CONTACT_96330] 29 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.2022  
 identified health system liaisons (Courtney Olson-Chen for URMC, Caitlin Dwyer for RRH, 
Jessica Hsu UCLA and Judy Chen for LADHS) or the assigned vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] (not yet 
determined) for each site. The names, e-mail addresses, site locations, and an assigned 
subject ID for each person, will be stored in a password protected Excel/Word file on a 
password protected computer. No additional study information (e.g., survey responses) will 
be contained within this file. All files will be stored on a secure server within each university 
system (URMC/UCLA).  
 
Once e-mail addresses have been obtained, each study coordinator will upload the e-mail 
addresses onto the secure REDCap platform. Surveys will automatically be disseminated to 
the appropriate subjects in the appropriate timeframe (weekly, monthly, bi-monthly) through 
previous REDCap programming completed by [CONTACT_9137]. Completed REDCap 
survey data will be exported in an Excel/Word file and stored under double-locked conditions on a secure server within each university system (URMC/UCLA), before transfer 
to the UCLA Health Sciences Box platform (a regulated platform frequently used by [CONTACT_96331]) for analysis by [CONTACT_46776]’s UCLA data specialists .  
 
Surveys for which payment (gift card or check) is given will request home address 
information within the survey questionnaire. This information will temporarily remain on the 
secure REDCap platform and/or secure university server, and will be utilized by [CONTACT_96332]. All personal address information will be 
destroyed once payments for phase [ADDRESS_106457] been fully completed.  
 
Data Obtained via EHRs: 
 
EHR data reports will be generated only by [CONTACT_96333]. A minimal number of patient-level data fields (only those needed for analysis) will 
be extracted from the EHRs. For data verification purposes, identified study staff will check a 
small percentage of patient eRecord files to ensure the accuracy of generated EHR reports. 
The identified individuals will have access to EHR files and will complete all appropriate 
eRecord training prior to conducting data verification. All individual level data will be stored 
in encrypted form on the secure Box platform. Whenever possible, data will be stored in 
aggregate form. “Rate Feedback” reports received by [CONTACT_96334] (no individual patient information), 
and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_96293] a study ID# rather than a name. 
 
All Research Data : All individual-level research data (saved in encrypted form) will be stored on the secure UCLA Health Sciences Box platform (a regulated platform frequently 
used by [CONTACT_96335]). Aggregate data will be stored on secure 
university servers and/or the secure Health Sciences Box platform. Analyzed data reports 
from the UCLA data specialist will be sent in a de-identified form via secure e-mail to the 
project PI [INVESTIGATOR_96294]. Any files linking subject name [CONTACT_96344]# (e.g., REDCap survey 
files, personnel ID files for feedback reports) will be password protected and stored on secure 
university server systems accessible only by [CONTACT_464].

 15. DATA / SAMPLE STORAGE FOR FUTURE USE 
 
Hard copy data : Due to the online (e.g., REDCap) nature of data collection during phase [ADDRESS_106458]-copy documents will be created or stored.  
 
Electronic data: 
 
Site Meeting Attendance:  
Files containing site meeting attendance records will be stored in password protected 
Excel/Word files on password protected computers. No additional study information 
(e.g., survey responses) will be contained within these files. All files will be stored on a 
secure server within each university system (URMC/UCLA). Once all MOC, CME and 
CNE credit requests have been completed, attendance records will be destroyed.  
 
E-learning modules, PDSA cycles, Time & Cost Surveys, Provider & Nurse Survey, 
Practice Culture Survey: 
Survey data is stored immediately upon completion by [CONTACT_96336]. Study staff 
will then access the secure password-protected survey site to generate data reports when 
needed.  These data reports will be stored on password-protected computers within the 
locked offices of study staff (double-locked conditions) using the secure university 
servers. Any personal address information  obtained from study subjects for the purposes 
of payment will be destroyed once payments for phase [ADDRESS_106459] names.   
 
EHR data output:  
Individual-level EHR data reports (saved in encrypted form) and aggregate EHR data reports will be stored on the secure UCLA Health Sciences Box platform (a regulated 
platform frequently used by [CONTACT_96335]). Analyzed data 
reports from the UCLA data specialist will be sent in a de-identified form via secure e-
mail to the project PI [INVESTIGATOR_96294].  All data will be stored 3 years beyond study 
completion.  
 
16. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 
This study presents no more than minimal risk, however there is still a risk to privacy and 
confidentiality. Prior to the start of aim/phase 1, the research team from both NY and CA met to 
create a data safety monitoring plan. PIs, team members, and representatives from each study 
clinic regularly discuss communication and action plans in the unlikely event that an adverse 
event occurs. Information on how to contact [CONTACT_96337], mail or email is readily 
apparent to all participating providers and care team members. Though adverse events are not 
anticipated, should any occur they will be reported to the site PI (“team leader”) in each state and 
then to the IRB at the time of the event, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_96295], as needed.

 17. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN 
 
Primary outcomes (receipt of Flu and Tdap vaccines) are binary and our main explanatory 
variable will be an indicator for study arm. We will employ intent-to-treat analyses using 
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with practice random effects, an approach 
recommended for group-randomized RCTs in which the goal is to estimate the causal effects of 
interventions on individuals, adjusted for clustering within groups. This method performs well in 
situations where the number of observations per cluster is large and for unequal cluster sizes. 
Models will assume a binomial distribution and a log link function in order to compare 
vaccination rates between study arms in terms of risk ratios. We will adjust for all practice-level 
variables included in the randomization balancing criterion, as well as patient-level race/ethnicity 
(and prior year vaccination status for the flu analysis). Hypothesis tests will be two-sided with 
alpha = 0.025, reflecting a 2-fold Bonferroni correction for the co-primary endpoints of Flu and 
Tdap vaccination status, ensuring a familywise type I error rate of 0.05. Analyses will be 
performed using SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 
 
Power Analysis: We assume national vaccine rates for flu (49%) and Tdap (54%). Adjusting for clustering of patients in practices, and assuming an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 1% 
(consistent with previous work), this sample size provides >80% power to detect an overall 
increase of 6.[ADDRESS_106460] (a simplification of the planned mixed model 
analysis described above), a test-level alpha of 0.025, and a sample size of 5,000 pregnant 
women organized into 16 practices per study arm. 
 
Final Time/Cost Analysis:  
Upon completion of aim/phase [ADDRESS_106461] a final time/cost analysis. Our two-fold 
cost measures are (a) total intervention cost to implement the VAX-MOM program aggregated at 
the four health-system level under a cost analysis and (b) cost per additional flu or Tdap 
vaccination under a subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis. To derive a policy implication 
regarding the sustainability of programs, we will estimate costs and ICER estimates from the 
health system perspective. 
 
Total Cost: To make these cost measures comparable to similar past interventions of 
reminders and educational programs, we will estimate cost with one-year time horizon, 
excluding the cost to purchase, store and administer vaccines. We will estimate the total 
intervention cost, summing non-personnel costs (e.g., EHR hardware, software, and materials) 
and personnel costs. The personnel costs will distinguish research costs from intervention costs 
(e.g., practice-level meeting and collecting EHR data). The dollar values of these personal costs 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_96338] “time efforts” (weekly reported by [CONTACT_96339] a 
REDCap email survey) with the nationally representative “hourly-wage rates” by [CONTACT_96340], derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  
 
Cost-Effectiveness: We will develop a standard decision model for our cost-effectiveness 
analyses. The effectiveness measures are the rates of flu and Tdap vaccination estimated under 
Aim 2b.  
 
Page 32 of 34 
Version Date: 6.22.[ADDRESS_106462] for the control group (costControl) is zero. To make separate ICER 
estimates for flu and Tdap vaccination, the Tdap-vaccination-specific costStudy will be 
estimated during non-flu season (April to September) first and applied for calculating the flu-
vaccination-specific costStudy during a flu season (October to March), assuming the Tdap-
vaccination-specific costStudy is constant throughout a year. Using the developed standard 
decision model, we will conduct probabilistic analyses to generate point estimates and 95% CIs 
for ICERs and one-way sensitivity analyses to determine conditions for being lower than the 
thresholds of cost-effectiveness, e.g., healthcare-system based quality improvement interventions 
to improve flu vaccination uptake targeting general populations (median ICER $51 among 23 
interventions) and healthcare workers (median ICER $125 among 6 interventions) reported by a 
systematic review. 
 
Hyp. : Cost per additional flu or Tdap vaccination under the VAX-MOM is lower than past 
similar interventions.

r-tPA 2mg in 20cc 0.9% NaCl divided into two (2) 10cc syringes to administer 
in two (2) pulse sprays, 10cc each, th rough the infusion port with 10cc 
syringes.  Unilateral PE: 2mg total in 20cc admi nistered in two (2) 10cc syringes. 
Bilateral PE: 4mg total in 40cc administ ered in two (2) 10cc syringes into each 
PA for a total of four (4) syringes, two (2) into each PA. 
Infusion:   
Unilateral PE: r-tPA 5mg in 500cc 0.9% NaCl infused at 1.00mg/hr at an 
infusion rate of 100cc/hr, through the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter until r-tPA mixture has completely infused . Total r-tPA dose (pulse spray and 
infusion) is 7mg. Bilateral PE: r-tPA 5mg in 500cc 0.9% NaCl infused at 1.00mg/hr at an 
infusion rate of 100cc/hr bilatera lly through each Bashir™ Endovascular 
Catheter, until r-tPA mixture has complete ly infused, for a total r-tPA dose of 
1.0mg/hr through each catheter. Total r-tPA dose (pulse spray and infusion)

ANTICOAGULANT 
DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION Pre-procedure:  There is a choice of anticoagulation to be administered 
according to the investigator’s standard of care.   
1. If the investigator’s standard of care is to use heparin, unfractionated 
heparin (UFH) will be administered by [CONTACT_440115].   
2. If the administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), such as 
enoxaparin (Lovenox®), is the investigator’s standard of care, administer 1mg/kg sub-Q every 12 hours. 
BEC Procedure:  Choose one of the two scenarios below according to the 
investigator’s standard of care:  
1. If heparin was administered pre-procedure or patient received LMWH 
1mg/kg SQ >[ADDRESS_557923] on heparin infusion in the IR suite / cath lab. Once r-tPA infusion is started, decrease heparin infusion dose to five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
2. If LMWH was administered ≤ 12 hours pre-procedure, start BEC procedure 
without heparin in the IR suite / cath lab, until patient is [ADDRESS_557924] 
dose of LMWH. Then start infusion of UFH at five (5) to eight (8)  units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.   
Post-BEC Procedure:  Heparin infusion at the completion of the BEC 
procedure and during the r-tPA infusion: 
1. Continue heparin administration through the side arm of the sheath at five 
(5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  If bilateral BECs are in place, the heparin infusi ons must be administered into each 
sheath.  Administer half (or approxi mately half) the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_440116]. 
2. If subject has not reached [ADDRESS_557925] dose of LMWH in the IR suite 
/ cath lab, then in the ICU start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8)  
units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
Post r-tPA Infusion:  Once r-tPA infusion is complete, increase UFH dose to 
target aPTT within therapeutic range (aPTT suggested 60-80 sec). Replace r-
tPA infusion with standard heparinized saline through the basket infusion line 
connector of the BEC(s) at 30cc/hour to  maintain patency until removal.  
Sheath Removal: Stop UFH for at least one (1) hour prior to sheath removal, 
unless the operator believes that the UFH, in the best interest of the patient, 
should not be stopped prior to and during sheath removal.  Remove sheaths according to standard of care. 
Anticoagulation Post-Sheath Removal: Re-start anticoagulation within one 
(1) hour post sheath removal with LM WH 1mg/kg SQ q [ADDRESS_557926] of care. If physicians choose to use DOACs then patients should be 
properly loaded according to the current guidelines.

(RMMS) regards each lung as having [ADDRESS_557939] to the MM, however, the RM score allows for a ﬁner 
distinction of partial obstruction in sev en major arteries; the main pulmonary 
artery, left and right pulmonary artery, left and right interlobar arteries, left 
and right basal trunks. Partial obstruction is classi ﬁed into three categories 
based upon cross-sectional diameter reduction: 0.5 for 1–33%, 1.0 for 34–
66%, and 1.5 for 67–99% obstruction. As in the MM scoring system, the weighted score of the major supplying ar tery is compared with the sum of its 
tributaries, and the larger number is recorded. For example, if thrombus 
obstructed the lumen of a basal trunk v essel by 50% (score =1.0 x 7), but its 
four segmental tributaries were fully occluded (score = 2.0 x 4), the higher value of 8 would be recorded as th e RMM score. A cumulative score is 
calculated by [CONTACT_440124]. Similar to the MM score, 
the RMM score can range from 0 to 20 per lung, for a maximum of 40 bilaterally.

TERM DEFINITION   
TIA Transient ischemic attack 
Troponin Cardiac troponins are the most sensitiv e and the most specific biochemical 
markers showing myocardial injury. El evated troponin can also be seen in 
acute pericarditis, myocarditis, acute PE, severe cardiac failure, sepsis and 
acute renal failure as well as in myocardial infarction.  In acute PE, the 
mechanic load of the right ventricle is increased because of the increased 
pulmonary vascular resistance following pulmonary artery obstruction. That 
can lead to acute right ventricular dilatation. The dilatation and hypokinesia 
of the right ventricle may cause severe myocardial ischemia and increase the 
troponin levels. Increased serum Troponin levels support the diagnosis of 
severe PE.

4.1 Clinical Problem   
Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and acute 
pulmonary embolism (PE). PE occurs when a deep  vein thrombus breaks loose and embolizes 
to the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death 
after myocardial infarction and stroke and is a major global health problem.1,2    
 
Raskob et al (2014) conducted a literature search a nd review and found that there is a strong and 
consistent association between an increase in incidence of VTE and increasing age. They found 
the annual incidence increased from between 2 and 7 per 1,000 populati on for those 79 and 
younger to between 3 and 12 per 1,000 population for those aged 80 and older.  This finding has 
major implications for the treatment of the elderly in the US healthcare system.2 It is important 
to note that 60 percent of the VTE events are associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].3 The number of 
deaths from VTE in the [LOCATION_003] has previously been reported to be approximately 300,000 
annually.3,4 Clinically, study subjects may present with DVT or PE, or both.  With many of the 
known risk factors, advanced age, immobility, su rgery, obesity, increasing in our society, this 
number only continues to grow.  Because there is  no national surveillance program for VTE, the 
precise number with VTE of all types is unknown.5,6 
 
Patients who present with PE may be classified into  low risk, intermediate risk (submassive) or 
high risk (massive) PE. Both massive and submassive PE cause right ventricular (RV) 
dysfunction, while massive PE in addition causes systemic hypotension.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_440092] (CT) to diagnose the PE, 
echocardiography to assess right and left ventricu lar function, and cardiac biomarkers, such as 
troponin I, and BNP to assess the degree of myocardial ischemia/strain associated with the PE.  
Patients categorized as having a low-risk PE do not have evidence of hemodynamic compromise 
or RV dysfunction.  Low risk PE patients are not included in this study for obvious reasons.[ADDRESS_557943] been utilized.8-10 However, systemic administration of 
thrombolytics carries a prohibitively high risk of bleeding: Up to 7% intracranial bleeds and up 
to 20% major bleeding rates; he nce the attraction of delivering thrombolytics in much lower 
dosage directly into the clot to treat this potentially life-threatening condition.[ADDRESS_557944] been developed and utilized.   The percutaneous devices include 
manual thrombus fragmentation using a balloon di latation catheter or a pi[INVESTIGATOR_3828] (off-the shelf

produce greater fragmentation of the clot comp ared to off-the-shelf technologies mentioned

catheter directed low-dose fibrinolysis using r-t PA (EKOS, Bothell WA). With this technology, 
the EKOS ultrasound device was used to deliver t-PA in patients with massive and submassive 
PE at 1mg/hour over 24 hours (unilateral PE), and 2mg/hr over 12 hours (bilateral PE).[ADDRESS_557947] reported that th e ultrasound component of the EKOS device does 
not contribute to the effectiveness of the tr eatment of submassive and massive pulmonary 
embolism.  Kuo et al (2015) found in a real-wor ld registry, for CDT that incorporated [LOCATION_003]T, 
there was no advantage in patients treated with US AT vs standard CDT. These data suggest that 
CDT may be performed effectively without  the added cost associated with [LOCATION_003]T.[ADDRESS_557948] infusion 
catheters, Bloomer et al (2017) reported a st udy for the Safety of CDT for massive and 
submassive PE: Results of a multi-center registry and Meta-analysis. Bloomer et al found in a 
subgroup analysis comparing patients treated with EKOS to those treated with standard infusion 
catheters, that there were similar PA pressure changes after CDT and similar complication rates. 
CDT is associated with a low major complication rate.17  
Tafur et al (2016) conducted a Systematic Revi ew and Meta-Analysis of Modern Literature. 
They concluded from their study current clinical evidence does not show that [LOCATION_003]T is superior 
to other CDT methods.18   
Overall, CDT decreased PASP, decreased RV to LV diameter ratio, and reduced the Modified 
Miller Index scores.  The goal of CDT is to substantially reduce thrombus burden, as assessed 
by [CONTACT_440126], which rema ins high with currently available catheters, 
with or without [LOCATION_003]T.   
While it is critical to reduce RV/LV ratio, it is of great importance to both short-term and long-
term patient outcomes to decrease the thrombus burden as much as is feasible.  Even a small 
reduction in the clot burden can translate in to a marked improvement in RV function and 
improve acute survival. However, much more e ffective reduction in the residual clot burden is 
required to reduce the long-term complicati ons of PE, including disabling post-PE syndrome 
and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).[ADDRESS_557949] unprovoked VTE. Therefore, the treatme nt options for patients who present with DVT 
and/or acute PE must continue to evolve to increase efficacy, decrease side effects, limit long-
term complications, and provide an improved qua lity of life for these patients. This study is 
focused on the treatment of patients with acute  submassive PE with an interventional device

burden.   
 
The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has been designe d to administer therapeutic agents in the 
peripheral vasculature.  Because of the unique desi gn of the catheter, with its six expandable 
infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter  has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger 
central channel for blood flow, thereby [CONTACT_3874]’s own endogenous fibrinolytic agents 
to lyse the clot, and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of a catheter-administered 
thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus.  E xpansion of the multiple arms of the basket in 
the infusion catheter causes fissu ring of the clot. The net result is that a greater surface area of 
clot is exposed to both endoge nous and exogenously administ ered lytic agents, thereby 
[CONTACT_3875]. 
 
This study will utilize the Bashir™ Endovascular Ca theter and the Bashir Endovascular Catheter 
with a short basket (Bashir™ S-B endovascular catheter) to administer catheter directed 
thrombolysis in patients with submassive PE who have consented and meet all eligibility 
criteria.  The Bashir™ and Bashir™ S-B e ndovascular catheters represent a new methodology 
for localized catheter-based delivery of thrombolyti cs. The thrombolytic to be used in this study 
is r-tPA (Genentech Corporation, South San Francisco, [LOCATION_003]).[ADDRESS_557951] ered lower doses of r-tPA over a shorter period 
of time.  While each group showed a statisti cally significant reduction in RV/LV ratio at [ADDRESS_557952]-procedure, the reduction in residual clot burden was noticeably lower (6%) in patients 
treated with the smallest dose of  r- tPA for the shortest time period (4/8 mg r-tPA over 2 hours) 
compared to those treated with the highest dose for the longest duration (26% reduction in clot 
burden; 12/24 mg r-tPA over 6 hours). This illustrates the discordance between reduction in 
RV/LV diameter ratio and reduction in clot burden, as well as a dose response relationship. 
between the dose of r-tPA administered and the reduction in clot burden.30 It is much easier to 
achieve the former than the latter with low doses of r-tPA for shorter periods of time. There is 
clearly also a lot of room for improvement if 74% of the clot burden still remains after the 
highest dose of infusion in the OPTALYSE study.21

This protocol is confidential prop erty of Thrombolex, Inc and in no wa y should be distributed all or in

Catheter from what was administered in the SEATTLE II study, i.e. 24mg over 12 hours 
(bilateral PE) or 24 hours (unilateral PE), becau se of its unique features described previously, 
as well as our experience in the First- in-Man study just completed with the BEC in patient with 
acute submassive pulmonary embolism (see below).20 We therefore propose to utilize the 
following regimen: r-tPA 2mg in 20cc administered,  1.0mg in two 10cc increments  into the 
PA for a total of [ADDRESS_557954] has bilateral pulmonary embolisms. The pul se sprays will be followed by a 5mg infusion 
at 1.00mg/hr until complete for unilateral PE, a nd 5mg infusion into each pulmonary artery for 
bilateral PE, at 1.0mg/hr until complete.  This is  a total of 10.0mg over approximately five hours 
(pulse spray 1.0mg x 2 sprays = 2mg plus infusi on at 1.0mg/hr x 5 hours = 7mg for unilateral 
PE). For bilateral PE, we propose to administer  the same pulse spray and same infusion dose 
into each PA for a total of 14mg administered.  This is a substantially lower dose and a shorter 
duration of treatment compared to SEATTLE II for the treatment of PE in a similar patient 
cohort.   
4.[ADDRESS_557955]-in-man study has been completed.  Nine  subjects were enrolled, treated, and followed 
through 30-day follow-up.  Patients received 2 X 1mg pulse sprays of r-tPA into each affected 
pulmonary artery followed by a total of 10mg r-t PA over 8 hours. The total dose of r-tPA for 
unilateral PE was thus 12mg and for bilateral PE 14mg.  Through 30-day follow-up there were 
no deaths, BEC or r-tPA related major bleeding, or device related adverse events. After 48 hours 
the RV/LV ratio decreased from 1.52  0.26 to 0.97  0.06 (p = .0009: 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.82: 
36.7% reduction) as assessed by [CONTACT_440127] (Medical Metrics, Houston, TX). 
Thrombus burden measured by [CONTACT_440128] 
(Medical Metrics, Houston, TX) decreased from 25.4  5.3 to 16.0  4.0 (p = .0005: 95% CI = 
5.5 to 13.4: 37.1% reduction). BEC CDT appears safe, preliminary evidence shows that this 
platform technology leads to significant reducti on in RV/LV ratio and thrombus burden.  The 
study protocol permitted to enroll up to ten (10)  subjects.  The sponsor stopped enrollment on 
December 3, 2019 due to the consistent results shown across the sites after nine (9) subjects

5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE 
The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter (BEC) and the BEC Short Basket (S-B) are devices intended for 
the localized infusion of therapeu tic agents into the pulmonary arte ry and peripheral vasculature. The 
distal infusion segment of the device contains an e xpandable radial array of conduits with a total of 48 
laser drilled orifices used for the delivery of the ther apeutic agents at multiple cross-sectional points of 
the target vessel location. The infusion segment ca n be expanded and collapsed  by [CONTACT_3876] (slider) 
located on the handle at the proximal end of the devi ce. The infusion line connector is also located on 
the handle.22 The difference between the BEC and the BEC S-B is solely in the length of the basket. In 
its unexpanded state, the basket of the BEC 12.5c m long and the BEC S-B basket is 10cm long. The 
choice of device used will be at the physician’s di scretion based on the patient’s anatomy.

1. Physical Examination  – The physician will perform a physical exam 
within [ADDRESS_557971] meets eligibility 
criteria.  
 
2. RV/LV Diameter Ratio  – The RV/LV ratio will be measured within [ADDRESS_557972] meets the eligibility 
criteria of an axial RV/LV ratio ≥ 0.9, as determined by [CONTACT_251198].  The independent core lab pr otocol will be followed for data 
acquisition.  The CTA will be sent to the core lab for analyses.  
 
3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  – A 12-lead ECG will be performed 
prior to the procedure.  
7.1.4 Anticoagulation 
Pre-procedure:  There is a choice of anticoagulation to be administered 
according to the investigator’s standard of care.  
1. If the investigator’s standard of care is to use heparin, unfractionated 
heparin (UFH) will be administered by [CONTACT_440135].  
2. If the administration of LMWH, such as enoxaparin (Lovenox®), is the 
investigator’s standard of care, administer 1mg/kg sub-Q every 12 hours.  
BEC Procedure:  Choose one of the two scenar ios below according to the 
investigator’s standard of care:  
1. If heparin was administered pre-procedure or patient received LMWH 
1mg/kg SQ >[ADDRESS_557973] on heparin infusion in the IR suite / cath lab.  Once r-tPA 
infusion is started, decrease dose of heparin to five (5) to eight (8) 
units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. ACTs may be checked if 
standard of care. 
2. If LMWH was administered pre-procedure, start BEC procedure without 
heparin in the IR suite / cath lab, un til patient is [ADDRESS_557974] dose of 
LMWH.  Then start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a 
maximum of 1,000 units/hr. ACTs may be checked if standard of care. 
 
Post-BEC Procedure:  Heparin infusion at the completion of the BEC 
procedure and during the r-tPA infusion: 
1. Continue heparin administration through the side arm of the sheath at five 
(5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  If bilateral 
BECs are in place, then one-half of the dose of the heparin infusion must 
be administered into each sheath for a total prescribed dose.  Administer 
half (or approximately half) the dose pr escribed by [CONTACT_440136]. 
Thrombolex, Inc. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_440084]: G200009  
Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_557975] dose of LMWH in the IR suite / 
cath lab, then in the ICU start dose of UFH at five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr 
up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
 
Post r-tPA Infusion:  Once r-tPA infusion is complete, increase UFH dose to 
keep aPTT within therapeutic range (aPTT suggested 60-80 sec).  Replace r-
tPA infusion with standard heparinized saline at 30cc/hr on an infusion pump 
through the basket infusion line connector of the BEC(s) to maintain patency 
until removal of the BEC(s).   
 
Sheath Removal: Stop UFH for at least one (1) hour prior to sheath removal, 
unless the operator believes that the UFH, in the best interest of the patient, 
should not be stopped prior to and duri ng sheath removal.  Remove sheaths 
according to standard of care. 
Anticoagulation Post-Sheath Removal: Re-start anticoagulation within one 
(1) hour post sheath removal with LMWH 1mg/kg SQ q12hrs or UFH at 
therapeutic doses for 24hrs post sheath removal.  After 24hrs post sheath 
removal, physicians can start therapeu tic anticoagulation according to their 
standard of care.  If phys icians choose to use DOACs then patients should be 
properly loaded according to the current guidelines.  
7.1.5 Data Collection 
The following data will be collected and documented in the CRF in addition to 
the required pre-procedure testing.

1. Prepare all r-tPA solutions and IV infusion mixtures in Section 8.3  prior to 
opening the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter (BECs).  The Bashir™ S-B 
Endovascular Catheter may be preferred fo r smaller patients or for treatment of 
thrombus in the left pulmonary.   
2. Prepare the relevant BEC(s) for use: 
a. Ensure that the infusion basket of th e BEC can be expanded and collapsed by 
[CONTACT_440137].  
b. With the basket expanded, flush the basket infusion port with standard flush 
solution. Observe for flush solution ex iting the infusion holes of the basket.  
Collapse the basket. 
c. Flush the wire lumen of the BEC observing that flush solution exits the tip of 
the catheter.   
3. Using a .018in x 300cm length steel core  non-hydrophilic guidewire, introduce the 
wire into the central lumen of the long sheath. 
4. Backload the BEC onto the 0.018in guidewire and advance towards the long sheath. 
DO NOT insert the BEC into the sheath.   
5. Attach a three-way stopcock to the infusion basket port of the BEC. 
6. Commence r-tPA infusion via the stopcock on the basket infusion line connector 
using an infusion pump. Start the infu sion through the BEC PRIOR TO inserting 
the catheter into the sheath. This is to maintain patency durin g catheter insertion, 
advancement, and positioning in the patient.

Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_557985] flow by [CONTACT_3884] r-t PA at the prescribed rate 100cc/hr for 
unilateral PE and bilateral PE, as stated in Table 2.  
9. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_440096] n expand the infusion basket of the BEC. 
9.5 Pulse Spray of r-tPA for Unilateral and Bilateral PE 
a. Unilateral PE :  With the catheter in the target PA , and after verifying that the basket 
portion of the catheter has exited the sheath under fluoroscopy, and with the 
guidewire in place, expand the basket of the catheter to the desired diameter making sure that the infusion limbs are expanded to less than the diameter of the vessel wall. 
b. Turn stopcock off to the infusion and administer 10ml (1.0mg r-tPA in 10ml) of 
pulse spray, from the [ADDRESS_557986], collapse the basket and re-expand 
the basket. 
d. Repeat this with the second 10cc syringe (1.0mg r-tPA in 10ml) over 10-15 seconds. 
e. As soon as the pulse sprays are administered, turn the stopcock open to the r-tPA 
infusion to restart the r-tPA via the infusion port of the BEC. 
Please note: Even if the clot appears to be primarily unilateral, the default should be 
to use a second BEC in the contralateral pu lmonary artery if there is any substantial 
clot on the contralateral side.   
f. Bilateral PE : Repeat, using a second BEC, steps a-e for bilateral PE. 
g. Once pulse sprays are complete, the basket(s) should remain expanded. 
h. Remove the guidewire(s), attach a 3-way stopcock and connect fluid or cap off the 
line. (See specifics at 9.9.3).  
Please note that the BEC is to be placed in the optimal location to treat the PE.  It is 
NOT to be used to selectively cannulate multiple branches of the pulmonary 
vasculature in multiple locations  to administer the r-tPA.  
9.6 r-tPA Infusion – Prior to Departing the IR Suite / Cath Lab 
1. For unilateral PE: The total r-tPA infusion is 5mg at 1.0mg/hr. Using an IV pump 
at 100cc/hr, infuse the 500cc of 0.9% NaCl with the 5mg r-tPA at 1.0mg/hr until 
infusion is complete (approximately 5 hours). 
2. For bilateral PE:  The r-tPA infusion is 5mg at 1.0mg/hr into each BEC. Using two 
(2) IV pumps at 100cc/hr, infuse the 500cc of 0.9% NaCl x 2 simultaneously for 
1.0mg/hr into each PE until complete (approximately 5 hours), for a total infusion 
dose of 10mg.  
Thrombolex, Inc. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_440084]: G200009  
Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_557987]-BEC Procedure 
Heparin infusion at the completion of the BEC procedure and during the r-tPA infusion 
1. Continue heparin administration through the side arm of the sheath at five (5) to 
eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a maximum of 1,000 units/hr.  If bilateral BECs are in 
place, the heparin infusions must be administ ered into each sheath.  Administer half 
(or approximately half) the dose prescribed by [CONTACT_440138]. 
2. If subject has not reached 8hrs post last does of LMWH in the IR suite / cath lab, 
then in the ICU start dose of UFH to five (5) to eight (8) units/kg/hr up to a 
maximum of 1,000 units/hr. 
9.8 Maintaining Patency Through the Central Lumen of the BEC(s) During Transport 
to ICU 
To maintain patency of the central lumen (guidewire lumen) of the BEC(s) during 
transport to the ICU, follow hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440097], unless 
the BEC central lumen is not going to be u sed for PA pressure monitoring in the ICU 
and it is capped off.  
9.9 Preparation in IR Suite / Cath Lab for Transfer to ICU 
1. Suture sheaths in place. 
2. Secure r-tPA and heparin drips to maintain infusions in the ICU. 
3. The BEC central lumen (guidewire lumen) may be used to monitor PA pressures in 
the ICU. 
a. Option #1: Connect fluid to central lumen (guidewire lumen) at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440098] (e.g. heparinized saline at 500 units/500cc .9% NaCl or 100 units/500cc .9% NaCl or .45% NaCl or other standard of care 
saline concentration, or normal saline wi thout heparin) using pressure tubing to 
the stopcock  to maintain patency until removal of the BEC(s).  Using this set-
up provides the option of monitoring th e PA pressures in the ICU during the r-
tPA infusion.   
b. Option #2:    If the central lumen of the BEC(s) is/are not going to be used for 
monitoring pressure in the ICU, the centr al lumen may be capped off prior to 
leaving the IR Suite / Cath Lab. 
4. Securing the device(s):   
a. For CFV Access: tape device to thi gh.  Then follow step “5” below. 
b. For Right IJ Access: Cover the catheter with a sterile sleeve (such as the sleeve 
that comes with a Swan-Ganz catheter) tape  device to left pectoral area with the 
shaft of the catheter placed posterior to the neck.  Then follo w step “5” below. 
Do the opposite for Left IJ access. 
5. Place a strong adhesive dressing, such as Tegaderm™ (3M™, St Paul, MN) or 
equivalent tape over the handle and the actua tor (slider) to make sure the handle and 
actuator (slider) are secure and cannot be moved.

10.1 r-tPA Infusion – Intensive Care Unit 
1. r-tPA Infusion:  Maintain the r-tPA Infusion thr ough the infusion line on the side 
of the handle of the BEC in the ICU for a pproximately five (5) hours from start of 
the infusion in the IR suite / cath lab.  Th e infusion should run at the rate prescribed 
in this protocol until the infusion is complete. See section 8.[ADDRESS_557990]-r-tPA Infusion: 
1. Maintain BEC Infusion Basket Patency: Once the  r-tPA infusion is complete, 
maintain patency through the infusion basket of the BEC(s) by [CONTACT_3866] r-tPA 
infusion with heparinized saline (per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109210] e.g. 500 units/500cc 
.9% NaCl or  100 units/500cc .9% NaCl or other standard of care heparinized concentration) using an infusion pump, at 30cc/hr, until the BEC(s) is / are 
removed.  Please note this solution must be heparinized. 
2. Anticoagulation Post-r-tPA infusion:  At the completion of r-tPA infusion,

(suggested 60-80sec).  
3. Physical Exam:  A physical exam is required to be performed as soon as possible 
after the completion of the r-tPA infusion.  
10.3 The Completion of r-tPA Infusion in the ICU  
1. The BEC catheter(s) will be removed as soon as possible at the end of infusion only 
by [CONTACT_440139]. Collapse 
the basket(s) of the BEC(s).  
2. Remove the BEC by [CONTACT_440140](s) carefully into the sheath(s) and then 
removing them from the body. Do not remove the sheath(s) at this time. 
3. Please note: If pressurized tubing set-up was used to monitor the pressure through 
the central lumen of a BEC in the ICU, aseptically remove the tubing from the port 
at the back of the BEC and set aside for using for step 5a below.   
4. Back bleed the sheath(s) and flush with heparinized saline. 
5. Attach pressure tubing to the side arm of  the sheath(s) and record the following: 
a. Final hemodynamic parameters (PAS, PAD,  PA Mean) – record from each PA 
if bilateral PE with bilateral sheaths in place. 
b. S

(after accounting for a 20% attrition rate of  subjects who are enrolled and treated) in a 
prospective, non-randomized, multi-center st udy. The following assumptions were used 
to determine the required sample size for the study: 
 This study would have an attrition rate of subjects enrolled and treated no greater 
than 20%. 
 A mean reduction of 28% in the primary efficacy endpoint (RV/LV diameter 
ratio) after 48 hours in BEC-treated patie nts.  It will be compared to the 
performance goal of 20% reduction in RV/LV diameter ratio after 48 hours. 
 A standard deviation (SD) on the scale of percent change for the primary efficacy 
endpoint (RV/LV ratio) of 25%. 
 An interim analysis will be conducted on ce data on [ADDRESS_558020] been 
collected, in order to obtain preliminary efficacy results using the primary 
efficacy endpoint. To constrain the overa ll type I error rate, an O’Brien-Fleming 
alpha spending function will be utilized, in which a stringent type I error rate of 
alpha=0.0038 will be used for the interi m analysis, leaving alpha=0.0212 for the 
final analysis, when study data are complete. 
Alpha values for interim and final analyses were obtained from the R package ldbounds 
function bounds(), which calculates alpha give n the type of spending function, timing 
of the interim analyses, and overall type I erro r desired.  The parameters used to obtain 
these alpha values were O’Brien-Fleming spending function, single interim analysis at

The primary efficacy endpoint is reduction in the chest CT-measured RV/LV diameter 
ratio assessed by [CONTACT_440147]  48 ± 6 hours of 
initiation of treatment.  
20.2.2  Hypothesis:  
The predicate device for Bashir Endovascula r Catheter is the EkoSonic Endovascular 
System (EKOS, Bothell, WA). The SEATTLE II Study reported a reduction in RV/LV 
diameter ratio of -0.42 ± 0.36 (mean ± SD ) in [ADDRESS_558023] measurement of RV/LV diameter ratio. We hypothesize that RV/LV 
diameter ratio measured at 48 hours compared  with measured ratio at baseline will be 
reduced on average by [CONTACT_726] 20%. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analytical methods:   A change score d will be calculated:  
𝒅ൌ   𝑹𝟒𝟖െ𝑹𝟎
𝑹𝟎 
that expresses the change as a propor tion of the baseline value, where R 0 and R 48 are  ୖ୚
୐୚ 
at time [ADDRESS_558024]-treatment, respectively.  A larger decrease from baseline 
will result in a change score with a greater magnitude and a negative sign.  The change 
score will be compared to the benchmark va lue of 20% in a one-sided hypothesis test: 
𝑯𝟎:𝒅൒െ 𝟎 .𝟐 
𝑯𝑨:𝒅൏െ 𝟎 .𝟐 
The distribution of the change score will be examined to assess whether the normality 
assumption is met, using both graphical methods  (Q-Q plots and histograms) as well as 
multiple hypothesis tests of norma lity (Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, 
Anderson-Darling, and Cramer-von Mises).  Multiple hypothesis testing methods will 
be employed to assess normality because the c hoice of the most powerful test depends 
on the distributional qualities of the data; if the different tests do not result in the same 
conclusion, more weight will be given to the method that is best suited to the observed 
distributional qualities of the data ( e.g., heaviness of tails).  If the data are determined 
to be normal based on these methods, a t test will be done; if not, a one-sample Wilcoxon 
Thrombolex, Inc. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_440084]: G200009  
Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_558025] (the non-parametric altern ative to the one-sample t test) will be done. 
In addition, the t-test will be presented for the primary endpoint analysis regardless of 
the normality of the test results. 
The test will be performed twice: once at the interim analysis (with α=0.0038) and once 
at the final analysis (with α=0.0212).  If the p-value is less than α at either analysis, then 
the test will be considered statistically significant.  
20.2.3  Primary Safety Endpoint:  
The primary safety endpoint is major bleed ing within 72 hours of procedure initiation 
of r-tPA infusion (the start of the infu sion). Bleeding events are classified by [CONTACT_440148] (ISTH).  
20.2.4  Hypothesis:  
The comparator device for Bashir Endovascu lar Catheter is the EkoSonic Endovascular 
System (EKOS, Bothell, WA), and results from the study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of this device were the basis fo r the performance goal of 14.9% proposed for 
this study. The SEATTLE II Study reported a 10%  (standard error=2. 45%) of moderate 
to severe bleeding in treated subjects within 72 hours of the treatment initiation.  The 
hypothesis is that the bleeding rate in this study will not exceed 10% + 2*SE = 14.9%.  
A one-sided, one-sample exact test of a binomial proportion p will be used to test the 
hypotheses below. 
𝑯𝟎: 𝒑൒𝟎 .𝟏𝟒𝟗 
𝑯𝑨:𝒑൏[ADDRESS_558026] a type I error rate of 0.025. 
20.2.5  Secondary Endpoints:  
Descriptive statistics will be generated fo r the secondary endpoints listed below.  For 
continuous measures (e.g., Modified Miller  Index comparing [ADDRESS_558027] therapy to 
baseline), the mean and 95% confidence limits will be calculated, along with the 
median, standard deviation and range.  For frequency outcomes (e.g., device success), 
results will be reported as the overall frequenc y of occurrence as well as the percentage 
of subjects.    
1. Device Success: The number of devices with therapy delivered without a device 
failure. 
2. Refined Miller Score as measured on contrast enhanced chest CT (CTA) within 48 
hours after the completion of the r-tPA in fusion compared to baseline as measured 
by [CONTACT_440119].  
3. All-cause mortality at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440087] 30-day follow-up.

5. AEs through 30-day follow-up. 
6. UADEs through 30-day follow-up. 
7. Recurrent PE through 30-day follow-up.  
8. Clinically Relevant Non-Major bleeding: Any sign or symptom of hemorrhage 
(e.g. more bleeding than would be expected  for a clinical circumstance, including 
bleeding found by [CONTACT_3868]) that does not fit the criteria for the ISTH 
definition of major bleeding but does meet at least one of the following criteria:  
a. Requiring medical intervention by a healthcare professional.  
b. Leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3820].  
c. Prompting a face to face (i.e., not just a telephone or electronic 
communication) evaluation.  
9. Technical procedural complications. 
10. Systolic PA pressure measured at comp letion of infusion after BEC(s) removal 
and compared to baseline. 
11. Cardiac output (CO by [CONTACT_440149]) and cardiac index 
(CI) following completion of the r-tPA infusion compared to the baseline. 
20.2.[ADDRESS_558029] whether study site is 
a predictor of the primary efficacy and saf ety outcomes.  Two regression models will 
be fit: a linear regression model having RV/LV diameter ratio as the dependent variable, 
and a logistic regression model having whet her major bleeding occurred (as defined by 
[CONTACT_440150] 72 hours of initiation of r-tPA infusion) as the dependent variable.  Each 
model will include site as an in dependent variable and test the hypothesis that study site 
was a significant predictor of each dependent va riable.  If the hypothesis tests show that 
site is not a significant predictor of either outcome, it will be concluded that the study 
sites do not differ substantially in terms of  outcome, and the data from sites will be 
pooled for analysis of all primar y and secondary endpoints.   
For the primary endpoints, descriptive statis tics by [CONTACT_440151]: the mean ± 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximu m RV/LV diameter ratio, and the proportion 
of patients experiencing major bleeding, will  be calculated for each study site and 
presented in a table to facilitate site comparisons.  
If the hypothesis tests reveal site differen ces for either outcome, analyses will be 
performed to compare study sites in term s of participant baseline characteristics ( e.g., 
demographics, medical history) as well as othe r variables that could influence clinical 
outcome such as eligibility criteria.  Anal yses of primary and secondary endpoints will 
be conducted separately for each study site, and the results of the site comparisons will 
be used to inform how to in terpret site-specific results. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed to dete rmine if RV/LV diameter ratio and the 
proportion of patients experiencing major bleed ing differ by [CONTACT_440152],

maximum RV/LV diameter ratio, and the pr oportion of patients experiencing major 
bleeding) will be calculated for each demogr aphic subgroup and presented in a table to 
facilitate group comparisons.  Regression m odels will be fit (linear regression for 
RV/LV diameter ratio, logistic regressi on for major bleeding) having each primary 
endpoint as the dependent variable and dem ographic group as the independent variable.  
A separate regression model will be fit fo r each combination of endpoint and 
demographic variable to formally test the hypothesis of subgroup differences in each 
primary endpoint.  
Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess the impact of missing data for the 
primary endpoints.   The methods for this an alysis are described in detail in Section 8 
of the Statistical Analysis Plan (THR O-STAT-2019-01), “Handling of Dropouts and 
Missing Data.” If subjects become COVID-19 positive after enrollment and during the 
study, a subgroup analysis will be performed. Refer to Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
(THRO-STAT-2019-01) for additional details. 
20.3 Analysis Populations  
All enrolled subjects who receive the study treatment will be included in the Intent-to-
Treat (ITT) population.  The ITT will consis t of subjects who both provide informed 
consent to participate and have the BEC (or first of two BECs for bilateral PE) 
introduced into the sheath. The modified ITT (mITT) population are evaluable subjects 
defined as members of the ITT who have data available to assess the primary efficacy 
endpoint of reduction in RV/LV ratio as m easured by [CONTACT_22242]-enhanced chest CT 
(CTA) at screening and RV/LV ratio as measured by [CONTACT_22242]-enhanced CTA at 48 
hours after completion of r-tPA treatment.  The patients comprising the mITT 
population are evaluable patients.  Members of the ITT population who remain in the 
study long enough to comple te the 30-day follow-up period will comprise the Per-
Protocol (PP) population.   
The mITT population will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint.  The ITT 
population will be used to analyze the primary safety endpoint, as well as all secondary 
safety and device endpoints that do not require 30 days of follow-up ( e.g., device 
success, clinically relevant non-major bleedi ng, technical procedural complications).  
The PP population will be used to analyze sec ondary endpoints that require 30 days of 
follow-up: all-cause mortality, SAEs, AEs, UADEs, and recurrent PE through 30-day 
follow-up).   
Up to [ADDRESS_558031] 100 subjects complete the 30-day follow-up period, and be included in the 
primary efficacy analysis.  Each site will ha ve an enrollment cap such that no more than 
20% (n=20) of participants are enrolled at a single site.

Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_558032] (DSMB) will be selected to review the study conduct, 
feasibility data, and safety data and will review all types of adverse events reported in this study 
and adjudicate as required.  The independent DS MB shall have the final adjudication for the 
events.  A data safety charter will be est ablished and will be approved by [CONTACT_4318].  
Qualifications for the DSMB members, at a mi nimum, shall include current experience with 
catheter directed thrombolysis for the treatment  of submassive pulmonary  emboli, management 
of the patient post-treatment and extensive resear ch experience. Adherence to the study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_440109].   
The DSMB shall have CEC responsibilities as we ll.  This hybrid committee include CEC 
responsibilities that include providing an independent  expert review of data on clinical events 
based on protocol-specific definitions.  The CEC review ensures that events critical to the 
analysis of study results are assessed in a unifo rm manner. This facilitates reliable pooling of 
data within a trial and with predicate trials and improves the validity of comparisons with 
published data.  In addition to study endpoints, the CEC will provide asses sment of other events 
or areas of concern at the request of the DSMB or Sponsor (e.g., device malfunction or failure, 
serious anticipated adverse events versus ser ious unanticipated adverse events). Member 
selection will be based on: 
 Balanced composition;  
 Relevant expertise;  
 Complete independence from the Sponsor and conduct of the trial;  
 Evaluation and documentation of an y Conflict of Interest; and  
 Commitment to flexible schedules for th e duration of the project life cycle.

Patient enrollment may be paused or termin ated early if the Sponsor or DSMB, and/or 
CEC determines that the potential benefits of  the investigational device are unlikely to 
outweigh the risks associated with continuation of the trial.

Age 18 years of age to ≤ [ADDRESS_558065] Scan (CTA), RV/LV diameter ratio ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_558066] scan (CTA) as determin ed by [CONTACT_3878].  They must not 
have had a CVA or TIA within one (1) year, head trauma, active intracranial,  or intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_440112] (1) year prior to inclusion in the study, any active bleeding from a major organ within 
one (1) month prior to inclusion in the study, an intracranial condition(s) that may increase the risk 
of bleeding, a bleeding diatheses, a hematocrit le ss than 30, platelet count less than 100,000/ μL, 
INR greater than 1.5 if currently on warfarin (Coumadin®), and each patient cannot have  an aPTT 
greater than [ADDRESS_558067] 
of eligibility criteria.   
2. OVERVIEW OF EFFICACY 
The Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter is intende d for the controlled and selective infusion of 
physician-specified fluids, including thrombolytics, into the peripheral vasculature.  A First-in-man 
study was recently completed for the treatment of subjects with submassive pulmonary embolism.  
The study included administration of r-tPA through the BEC in the form of pulse sprays followed 
by [CONTACT_440156].  Subjects with unilateral embolism were administered a 2mg pulse 
spray through the basket of the BEC into the pu lmonary artery (PA) followed by [CONTACT_60801] 
10mg over approximately eight hours for a total do se of 12 mg.  Subjects with bilateral embolisms 
were administered 2mg pulse sprays into each pulm onary artery followed by [CONTACT_60801] 5mg of 
r-tPA into each PA over eight hours for a total of 14mg.  Nine subjects were enrolled and treated.  
After 48 hours the RV/LV ratio decreased from 1.54  0.26 to 0.97  0.06 (p = .001: 95% CI = 
0.33 to 0.82: 36.7% reduction) as assessed by [CONTACT_440157] (Medical Metrics, Houston, 
TX). Thrombus burden measured by [CONTACT_440158] M iller Index as assessed by [CONTACT_205374] (Medical Metrics, Houston, TX) decreased from 25.4  5.3 to 16.0  4.0 (p = .001: 95% CI = 
5.5 to 13.4: 37.1% reduction).

3. OVERVIEW OF SAFETY 
In the First-in-Man study mentioned above, the stu dy results revealed an excellent safety profile 
for the BEC.  There were no adverse events or serious adverse events related to the device and 
there were no adverse events or serious adverse events related to the r-tPA.   
4. POTENTIAL RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION 
 
A. Potential Risks to Research Subjects 
The potential risks in the RESCUE study related to the device can be categorized in the following 
way in Table [ADDRESS_558072] category is not 
applicable, as the RESCUE study is the delivery of a therapy.

Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_558073] physician hazards , which should be addressed and 
mitigated with a reasonable level of certainty. 
Device Related SAEs Events attributable to the investig ational use of the device which produce 
an injury that is life threatening, results in permanent impairment or damage to the body, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body. 
Device Related AEs  (non-serious) Events attributable to the investigational use of the device which do not 
produce an injury or illness that is life-threatening, does not result in permanent impairment or damage to the body, or does not require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body. 
Procedure-related 
Complications Due to 
the Investigation This includes not just the device use, but risks related to the investigation 
itself to which the subject would otherwise not be exposed, e.g. risk of 
anesthesia during procedures involving an investigational device. 
Risks associated with the study itself Risks the subject may be exposed to that do not directly result from use 
of the device and would not be expected as part of usual care outside of 
the investigational setting. Examples include additional procedures (such 
as medical imaging) for ascertainment of study endpoints. 
Risk from false-positive or false-negative results for diagnostics N/A – The BEC is not a diagnostic device. 
 
A description and analysis of the risks to research  subjects related to the device and the study are 
listed below for each category in Table 3 above.  
Basic Safety: Physician hazards may include exposur e to blood and body fluids, which is standard 
for any invasive procedure in the interventional la b.  Physicians and sta ff wear personal protective 
equipment to prevent exposure.  This is not uni que to the investigational device in the RESCUE 
study.  There is no electrical power required for this device, so electrical safety issues are not 
relevant.   
Device Related SAEs or Device Related AEs (Non-Serious):   Device related SAEs may include 
allergic reactions, hematoma at access site, hemorrhage, intimal dama ge, ischemia, pain and 
tenderness, vascular thrombosis, vessel perforation,  and vessel spasm.  These adverse events will 
be categorized as serious only if one of the following conditions applies:  
An adverse event is any undesirable experience as sociated with the use of a medical product in a 
patient. The event is serious and will be collected when the patient outcome is: 
Thrombolex, Inc. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_440084]: G200009  
Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_558074] resulted in the death of the patient.  
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged) - Report if admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440101] a result of the adverse event. 
Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355103] (e.g., life-threatening; required 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically 
important event).  
4. Disability or Permanent Damage - Report if the adverse event resulted in a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal li fe functions, i.e., 
the adverse event resulted in a signific ant, persistent or permanent change, 
impairment, damage or disruption in the pa tient's body function/structure, physical 
activities and/or quality of life. 
5. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect - Report if you suspect that exposure to a 
medical product prior to conception or duri ng pregnancy may have resulted in an 
adverse outcome in the child. 
6. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment  or Damage (Devices) - 
Report if you believe that medical or surgical intervention was necessary to 
preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or prevent permanent damage 
to a body structure, either situation suspected to be due to the use of a medical 
product. 
7. Other Serious (Important Medical Events) - Report when the event does not fit the 
other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes. 
Examples include allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) 
requiring treatment in an emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood 
disorders) or seizures/convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The 
development of drug dependence or drug abuse would also be examples of 
important medical events.  
 
Procedure Related Complications Due to the Investigation:  These complications are unrelated 
to the BEC and may include access site pseudoane urysm, anemia, arrhythm ia, bleeding requiring 
blood transfusion, cardiac arrest, death, ecchymos is, hematuria, hemodynamic instability, heparin 
induced thrombocytopenia, infec tion, pain at access site, perfo ration, pneumothorax, pulmonary 
infarct, shock, skin necrosis (if on warfarin).  
Risks Associated with the Study Itself : The risks associated with  the study itself are discussed 
below. The additional risks are not expect ed to be above standard of care.

Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_558075] sh ould be distributed all or in part 
without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. B. Risk Mitigation and Risk Minimization 
 
1. Basic Safety:  There is no expected increase in basic safety concerns.  The sites selected 
are highly experienced in the protection from blood borne pathogens and the use of the 
BEC does not increase this risk.  Additionally , regarding radiation exposure for the staff 
and physicians, the procedure times are s hort compared to some interventional 
procedures.  The procedure time in the Firs t-in-Man study from local anesthetic to last 
wire out of the patient was a mean of 57 minutes (with a range of 43 minutes to 72 
minutes).  
 
2.  Device Related SAEs:   Allergic reaction – Staff monitor the subject for reactions and 
medicate the study subject accordingly.   
Hematoma at access site – This is potentially due to the venous stic k technique.  We are 
minimizing the potential for a hematoma by [CONTACT_440160].   
Hemorrhage – We are preventing hemorrhage by [CONTACT_440161]-CDT and hemodyna mic monitoring.  Having this expertise 
prior to study site selection will minimize the possibility of hemorrhage due to 
perforation.  Additionally, the dose of r-tPA is  less than the dose in other studies.  The 
RESCUE protocol requires a certain heparin do se and lovenox dose.  This is to prevent 
over anti-coagulation in the study subjects.   
Intimal damage – There is the potential fo r intimal damage with any interventional 
procedure within the vasculatu re.  This is minimized by [CONTACT_440162].  
Ischemia may be minimized by [CONTACT_440163], shorter time to improved 
ventilation and perfusion in the pulmonary embolism patient.   
Vascular thrombosis is prevente d with anti-coagulation.   
Vessel perforation is prevented by [CONTACT_440164]-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_440113]-CDT.   
Vessel spasm may occur but can be minimized  with highly experienced operators.  The 
potential for spasm is much less in venous treatment than with arterial treatment.   
 
3. Procedure-Related Complications: The procedure-related co mplications listed above 
will be mitigated by [CONTACT_440165], lab staff, and research staff.  In the 
First-in-Man study use in the pulmonary artery, the device was inserted through a long 
sheath that was placed in the pulmonary artery  prior to the BEC insertion.  This allows 
for easy insertion from the sheath outside of the patient into the right side of the heart 
and the pulmonary artery within the sheath.   The physicians place the device in the 
interventional lab by [CONTACT_440166] e sheath, and by [CONTACT_440167].  The entire basket is made of nitinol components; 
therefore, the entire basket is radiopaque under fluoroscopy.  This same technique will 
be used in the RESCUE study.  This mi nimizes the possibility of the BEC causing 
damage to the vasculature when bei ng inserted through the vasculature.

Protocol THRO-CLIN-2019-[ADDRESS_558076] sh ould be distributed all or in part 
without written permission from Thrombolex, Inc. 4. Risks Associated with the Study Itself: The CTA imaging is a requirement for the 
primary endpoint analysis.  Site staff will be trained on the image acquisition protocol 
and they will be qualified in advance to ensu re they have the proper imaging equipment 
to perform the tests.  Both of these requi rements should help reduce the exposure that 
could result from redoing study-required imaging.  If the 48-hour CTA is not standard 
of care, one extra CTA would be required for the study subject, a small increase in 
radiation exposure. The in-lab imaging is standard of care for the practicing 
interventionalist.  
 
C. Summary 
  Overall, the actions taken to mitigate risks include the following: 
1. Select qualified sites and investigators that meet strict criteria; 
2. Provide detailed didactic and hands-on device training; 
3. Ensure all investigators inspect the devi ce and prep the device and test it for 
functionality before use; 
4. Provide core lab requirement training; 
5. Support study procedure as needed with procedure and research experts to guide 
physicians and staff. 
 
5. POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
The potential benefit from BEC treatment of pulm onary embolism is effective treatment for the 
condition, as reduction in clot burden has b een demonstrated by [CONTACT_290730]/LV ratio reduction and 
decrease in refined Modified Miller Score in the Fi rst-in-Man study.  Additionally, there may be a 
lower bleeding risk with the BEC because of low r-tPA dose and shorter infusion times compared 
to what was required in SEATTLE II.  The design of the BEC creates multiple channels where 
blood can flow to increased exposure of the clot su rface area to fluid, e ndogenous lytics, exogenous 
lytics (e.g., r-tPA), thus potentially having a greater reduction in clot burden than other PM-CDT 
devices that create only a single channel.  This benefit remains to be seen in a larger population; 
therefore, the RESCUE study is being conducted.   
6. CONCLUSIONS 
As demonstrated in the First-in-Man study, the potential benefits outweigh the risks of treating 
patients with the BEC.

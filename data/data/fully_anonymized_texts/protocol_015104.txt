Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, [ADDRESS_283218] a disproportionately high rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_234401] [1]. While 
breathing tubes and mechanical ventilators are lifesaving supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], children have 
significantly higher short -term morbidity related to mechanical ventilation. These include higher 
rates of nosocomial infections, complications such as upper airway obstruction (UAO) after 
extubation (removal of the brea thing tube), exposure, tolerance and withdrawal from sedatives 
and analgesics used during mechanical ventilation, ventilator induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_234402], and significant increases in healthcare costs .  They may develop long term morbidity 
with neur odevelopmental impairment from inflammation associated with ventilator associated 
lung injury,  prolonged exposure to sedatives, functional impairment, and in some cases death 
from complications re lated to mechanical ventilation  [2-6].   
Shortening the amount of time children spend on mechanical ventilation would significantly 
reduce this morbidity.  There is a wealth of data that clinicians wean ventilators too slowly for 
many patients [2, 7, 8] .  At the same time, extubation failure rates may be as high as 20 - 50% in 
some neonates and infants, arguing that current tools inadequately gauge who is ready for 
extubation.  Finally, 40% of neonates and infants are managed with non -invasive ventilation 
after extubation, and are often left on this therapy days longer than needed due to lack of 
evidence based methods to wean this support.  
The key physiologic principle that drives weaning from mechanical ventilation surrounds effort 
of breathing.  The clinical surrogates for effort of breathing are based on clinical examination, 
are subjective, and have high inter -rater variability. Direct measurement of effort of breathing is 
possible using minimally invasive techniques with naso -esophag eal tubes, spi[INVESTIGATOR_75029], and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_234403] (RIP) bands. We have strong preliminary data from a 
completed N IH funded investigation here at CHLA  (CCI -11-[ZIP_CODE])  involving > 400 
mechanically ventilated children (neonates to adolescent)  that objective measures of effort of 
breathing may aid clinical decision making regarding readiness for extubation, detecting and 
managing complications after extubation such as upper airway obstruction (UAO), and titrating 
noninvasive ventilation support .   We have recently applied for RO1 award to conduct a follow 
up study which would be a randomized controlled trial comparing  an objective measure of effort 
of breathing (esophageal manometry) guided approach to a more conventional ventilator 
protocol, in corporating current evidence.  Our hypothesis is that this protocol will lead to faster 
ventilator weaning, by [CONTACT_234429][INVESTIGATOR_65172].  To do this, 
we plan to incorporate physiologic measurements and calculations which w ill be displayed as 
part of a software program we have developed, provide recommendations to the clinicians who 
will ultimately accept or reject the protocol recommendations, and provide feedback as to why 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, [ADDRESS_283219] the  ventilator is managed  [8]. 
The convalescent phase represents a period of relative stability, but ventilator reductions (or 
weaning) have not begun.  The weaning phase is variable, and represents the time frame thro ugh 
which ventilator support is reduced until the breathing tube is removed (extubation).  However, 
weaning may continue after extubation when patients are placed on non -invasive ventilation, and 
ultimately the patient may fail weaning, and require re -intubation.  This may  be from unresolved 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, neuromuscular, or central nervous system disease, but may also be a 
direct consequence of complications of endotracheal intubation, including upper airway 
obstruction (UAO). Currently, clini cal assessment of disease stability, and effort of breathing is 
used to determine which phase the patient is in, and ultimately when it is time to begin weaning, 
how quickly to wean, when to extubate the patient, and whether the patient is failing extubati on.  
For the most part, this a ssessment of EOB has largely been based upon subjective clinical 
assessment  [8].  
 
Several studies in pediatrics have demonstrated two important phenomena to highlight the 
potential roo m for improvement in ventilator weaning strategies: (1) patients with unplanned 
extubation often do not fail extubation (suggesting they could have been extubated sooner than 
the cli nicians had planned to extubate  them) and (2) extubation failure rates bas ed on clinical 
assessment and decision making regarding extubation readiness range from 8 -50%.  This implies 
that current clinical assessment tools are inadequate at predicting who is likely to fail extubation.  
Moreover, previous studies on pediatric mech anical ventilation weaning have highlighted that 
nearly half of the patients are ready for extubation simply after they have had close to 24 hours in 
the convalescent phase of ventilation, and do not need a prolonged weaning phase  [7].   
 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, [ADDRESS_283220] important metric to consider in the clinical context  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_234404]: how the patient responds to the changes in pressure, resistance, and flow to 
maint ain ventilation and oxygenatio n. In physics, the term “work” is used to characterize the 
concept of force applied over a distance (or pressure across a volume). In the clinical setting, 
work of breathing can be calculated from the curve of esophageal pressure versus tidal volume. 
The w ork per breath can be computed from the area enclosed by a n esophageal pressure -tidal 
volume curve. However , the term “work” does not entirely characterize the effort necessary for a 
patient to breathe as it does not take into account the duration of contr action nor the energy 
required for isometric contractions of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_234405], the b etter term to use is 
“effort” of  breathing (EOB). While dependent upon the mechanical propert ies of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_36557], effort of breathing is more specifically an assessment of the load opposing respi[INVESTIGATOR_234406]. Metrics of EOB describe the activity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_234407]. Fundamentally, sustained periods of increased EOB 
eventually lead to respi[INVESTIGATOR_234408]. As such, 
therapeutic interventions , such as intubation and mechanical ventilation , are targeted at reducing 
EOB .  R esolution or normalization of EOB is hallmark for determining how to decrease 
ventilator support as mechanical ventilation is weaned.   
 
One of the most widely accepted methods for evaluating EOB in the p ediatric population is 
pressure. rate product (PRP). It i s an effective tool to measure effort of breathing as it takes into 
account the product of respi[INVESTIGATOR_234409]. It takes into account both isometric and productive contractions of th e 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_234410].  We have used PRP at CHLA for numerous clinical studies  on both invasively and non -
invasively ventilated patients  [9-13] [14]. We also have extensive experience with PRP 
measurements on animals  [15] [16].  
 
Preliminary Data from CHLA  (unpublished) : From the m ost recent set of investigations we have 
done at CHLA using an interim analysis on 350 children in our PI[INVESTIGATOR_234411]  (CCI -11-
[ZIP_CODE]) , we have found that effort of breathing values obtained prior to extubation while on 
minimal ventilator support are predict ive of weaning failure - particularly for the use of non -
invasive ventilation after extubation.  Moreover, effort of breathing values just after extubation, 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, 2021  
5 
 as well as the change in this value from the intubation value, is predictive of re -intubation.   
These values appear more predictive than current evidence based methods ( Rapid Shallow 
Breathing Index), and clinical estimation of extubation readiness.  This forms the rationale for 
the proposed study to use PRP based measures to study weaning and extubatio n readiness.  
 
Evidence based protocols  
 
While clinical judgment forms the basis for most current weaning strategies and ventilator 
management during even the acute phase of illness, there are evidence based guidelines that have 
been developed, largely fro m data from adults with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]  [8, 17] .  
We have developed a suite of tools to implement the evidence based guidelines for ventilator 
management, both for the acute phase of ventilation,  and for weaning, using a modification of 
the adult -based guidelines.  These protocols have been funded through grants from the National 
Institutes of Health (R21 PI [INVESTIGATOR_234412]), and have been vetted through the NIH funded 
Collaborative Pediatric Crit ical Care Research Network.   
Preliminary Data from CHLA (published):  We have previously demonstrated using data from 
our own institution, that clinicians frequently do not follow evidence based guidelines regarding 
ventilator management, and there are pot entially lost opportunities to improve our ventilator 
management by [CONTACT_234430] [17].  These protocols will form the basis 
for ventilator management as part of this study, and effort of breathing calculat ions will be added 
on top of these existing guidelines.  The suite of software tools simply gather data from the 
available clinical data at the bedside (laboratory feeds, ventilator connections), determine what 
the current best -evidence would suggest be do ne for the patient based on these parameters, and 
make a recommendation to the clinician. Ultimately, the clinician will determine whether to 
accept or reject the recommendation, and provide an explanation for why the recommendation 
was rejected to eventua lly improve the adherence to the protocol.   
 
Trans pulmonary pressure  
While implementing current evidence based guidelines has the potential to reduce length of 
mechanical ventilation and minimize risk of ventilator induced lung injury, there is the potent ial 
to improve on the current best evidence through optimization of ventilator support during the  
acute phase of illness.  Trans pulmonary pressure based titration of ventilator settings has 
demonstrated utility in the management of adult patients with ARDS  to improve oxygenation  
[18].  Preliminary Data from CHLA (unpublished):  We have preliminary data here as part of 
another approved study (CCI -13-[ZIP_CODE]) that there may be differences between clinician chosen 
ventilat or settings, and  recommendations based on trans pulmonary pressure. However, what is 
unclear and impossible to ascertain with the previous study design, is whether there would be a 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, 2021  
6 
 difference between ventilator settings recommended by [CONTACT_234431] -Pulmonary Pressu re (with the use 
of esophageal manometry), and the current best evidence based guidelines.  Our preliminary data 
demonstrates that TPP measurements are simple to obtain, may be different than clinically 
chosen values for, in particular, Positive End Expi[INVESTIGATOR_234413] (PEEP), and that changing  
PEEP values to normalize TPP is safe, with no significant change in cardiac output or oxygen 
delivery.     
 
 
Upper Airway Obstruction  
 
Preliminary Data from CHLA (published and unpublished) : Our preliminary data sugg ests close 
to 25% of children have upper airway obstruction (UAO) after extubation.  Those with UAO 
have a fourfold higher rate of re -intubation than those without UAO.  Moreover, there is an 
extremely high rate of variability in the clinical assessment of  UAO  [19], with practitioners 
frequently disagreeing on the presence of UAO (kappa values 0.2 -0.4).  We have developed an 
objective parameter to gauge UAO severity which integrates esophageal manometry and RIP 
signals. This parameter is displayed on the software to aid in decision -making, along with the 
integrated waveforms from RIP and esophageal manometry for clinical interpretation.   In 
preliminary analysis of the [ADDRESS_283221] developed, to aid in clinical decision -making.   
 
Software (Stage of development and validation):  
There are two pi[INVESTIGATOR_234414].  Neither of the software 
suites are specifically FDA approved.  However, they have been developed iteratively and  tested 
relatively extensively at times during clinic al care  and as part of already approved investigations .   
1.  CDS tool for implementing evidence based guidelines.   This tool has been developed in 
Microsoft Access over the past [ADDRESS_283222]. Newth has received NIH grants to iterate 
on this protocol (the evidence based recommendations), and they have been modified 
through the Collabo rative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network.  The software 
receives automated feeds from our electronic data resources in real time - and when an 
evaluation is due; it will pull in data and make a recommendation.  The recommendations 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, 2021  
7 
 are transparent - and the physicians can drill down to the rules to understand why the 
recommendation was made.  The physicians (or their surrogate - the respi[INVESTIGATOR_234415]) can then accept or reject the 
recommendation. If the rec ommendation is rejected, they will be asked to provide 
feedback as to why.  We have used this tool intermittently for clinical care for the last [ADDRESS_283223] ventilator support, it asks 
the providers if a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated. If the answer is yes, then the 
second pi[INVESTIGATOR_234416]  (See flow di agram below) .  
While this tool has been developed in Microsoft Access, to support better integration with 
the clinical workflow in the ICU, it has been migrated to a web -based platform. This 
enables it to be used on devices that have web -connectivity, and can interface with the 
current VDI systems in the ICU.   
 
2. Monitoring software integrating esophageal manometry, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and RIP signals.   
This software package has been developed extensively over the last [ADDRESS_283224]. 
Khemani’s NIH funded inv estigation.  It is a data capturing tool, enabling signals to be 
post-processed for the sake of interpretation for the NIH funded UAO study.  The device 
(Bicore II) is FDA approved through 510K equivalence, as are all the sensors. These have 
been used in t he ongoing UAO study with no complications. However, the software 
package (Polybench, Applied Biosignals) is capable of real time and near -real time 
display of data and calculations. These have been crucial during the UAO study to ensure 
the data being cap tured was reliable and representative of the patient state.  There have 
been [ADDRESS_283225] -processing program

Study Overview  
 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, 2021  
9 
 This is a single center prospective trial in the 24 bed multidisciplinary me dical -surgical pediatric 
intensive care unit (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]) at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723]. All patients intubated and 
mechanically ventilated with an anticipated length of intubation > 48 hours will be eligible. 
Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are d elineated below.   
 
5. Eligibility and Recruitment  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 
All patients intubated and mechanically ventilated in our Pediatric ICU with an anticipated 
length of intubation > [ADDRESS_283228] a  corrected ges tational age less than 37 weeks or  
contraindications to nasoesoph ageal catheter placement ( nasopharyngeal or esophageal 
abnormalities)  or RIP bands (abdominal wall defects such as omphalocele).   Patients with lower 
airway obstruction (asthma or bronchiolitis), confirmed by [CONTACT_234432][INVESTIGATOR_038] (standard 
practice in ICU) w ill also be excluded because the evidence based guidelines do not specifically 
address these patient populations.   
 
6. Methods and Procedures  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent Process  
 
All mechanically ventilated patients will be screened daily for potential  eligibility.  Parents or 
guardians will be asked to sign all consent forms as all the patients meeting criteria for the study 
will be either too young for the study, or sedated while on a mechanical ventilator . These forms 
include the consent form for the  study, the HIPAA Waiver, and the experimental subject’s Bill of 
Rights. The study will be explained to parents using non -medical language in the primary 
language of the parents using an interpreter as needed. Parents will have the opportunity to ask 
quest ions and voice concerns, and will be given the opportunity to withdraw from the study at 
any time.  
Study Treatments

 Schematic illustrati ons are displayed in Figures 1 -5. After consent, an esophageal catheter will 
be placed. The CDS tool for ventilator man agement will be placed at the bedside (on a laptop 
computer) for each enrolled patient, and recommendations regarding changing ventilator support 
will be provided to the clinicians every [ADDRESS_283229] evidence. Twice a day, trans pulmonary 
pressure measurement will be obtained (a.  on the current PEEP/FiO2 combination - as 
recommended by [CONTACT_234433] b.  PEEP will be changed to  make 
transpulmonary pressure zero ).  TPP measurements are obtained through an expi[INVESTIGATOR_234418]. 
This methodology will be identical to what is already approved as part of another ongoing 
investigation at CHLA  (CCI -13-[ZIP_CODE]) .  This data will be tracked to help generate a new 
protocol based on TPP. PEEP will be returned to the previous level after TPP calculations are 
complete.  Once the patient meets criteria for spontaneous breathing (see flow diagram below , 
Figure 1 ), they will enter the effort of breathing weaning arm of the study.   
 
In this weaning arm of the study, there will first be an oxyg enation test to ensure the patient can 
tolerate lower levels of PEEP and FiO2 in preparation for weaning. If they fail, they will go back 
to the previous ventilator settings and an oxygenation test will not be repeated again for 24 
hours.  If they pass, th ey will go to a 2 hour Spontaneous breathing trial.  Esophageal 
manometry, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_234417] (RIP) bands will be in 
place.  If they pass based on clinical criteria as well as guidance from the esophageal manometry 
proto col regarding effort of breathing and other pi[INVESTIGATOR_234419] (such as direction of 
the Konno M eade plot as an indication of neuromuscular weakness) the recommendation will be 
to extubate. If the clinician elects not to extubate, the reasons wil l be tracked.   
 
If patients fail the SBT, they will be placed on the previous PEEP (prior to oxygenation test) and 
PS equal to the delta P (PIP -PEEP) on the previous ventilator support. The protocol will then 
make recommendations every 2 hours regarding w eaning based on whether PRP has been in a 
range to wean, or a range to go back up on support  (Figure 2) .  Clinicians will ultimately decide 
whether or not to accept these recommendations, and again reasons for rejection will be tracked. 
Once the patient ac hieves PS level of ≤ [ADDRESS_283230] the recommendation, 
and again reasons for rejection will be tracked.  If the patient passes the SBT, the 
recommendation will be for extubation.  If the patient fails the SBT, PS will be returned to its 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, [ADDRESS_283231] prior to extubation, who were enrolled in the UAO  study.  
From this data, over 90% of the patients who were extubated successfully had a PRP on PS < 
250, and a PRP on CPAP < 400. Hen ce, the recommendations will be to wean PS if PRP is < 
250, to maintain PS if PRP is between 250 and 400, and to increase P S if PRP is > 400.  
Ultimately, the clinician will make the final determination regarding whether or not to make the 
wean, or to extubate the patient.  
 
The decision to begin non -invasive ventilation after extubatio n will be left to the clinician.   NIV 
management will be per clinician choice, and we will not impleme nt a NIV protocol.   
  
Diaphragm ultrasound measurements will occur daily, and will be conducted by [CONTACT_234434] -other ’s measurements.  We will place an ultrasou nd probe over 
the right hemi -diaphragm just lateral to the nipple line between and compute Diaphragm 
Contractile Activity (DCA).  DCA is obtained by [CONTACT_234435] m thickness on inspi[INVESTIGATOR_234420].  We will also use ultrasound to measure diaphragm thickness on exhalation and 
monitor how this changes serially over time as a measure of the architecture of the diaphragm.

Study Outcomes  
 
The following study outcomes will be followed for each of the proposed study objectives.  
 
1. Objective:  To refine the esophageal manometry based effort of breathing weaning 
protocol so that it can be used easily, and can a ttain high protocol adherence for eventual 
use in a randomized controlled trial. Outcome:  protocol adherence for each 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, 2021  
13 
 recommendation, as well as qualitative data on the reasons for rejection of the 
recommendation.  This will guide refinement of the protoco l.  
2. Objective:  To demonstrate that integration of these two pi[INVESTIGATOR_234421]. Outcome:  PRP 
values used to generate each recommendation will be tracked, and raw data will be 
recorded at least twice daily to compare calculated PRP values from the software 
program to the post -processing  program we currently use for the UAO study. Will also 
track reasons for rejecting recommendations (above), specifically targeting any 
recommenda tions which were rejected because of perceived problems with the software 
or calculations (incorrect data etc).  
3. Objective:  To determine the potential magnitude of reduction in length of mechanical 
ventilation afforded by [CONTACT_234436] a weaning tool, to help determine estimated sample 
size for a future randomized controlled trial. Outcomes:  The primary outcome is the total 
length of ventilation (invasive and non -invasive).  Secondary outcomes include length of 
invasive ventilation, length of non -invasive venti lation, re -intubation rates, use of inhaled 
medications to treat UAO, use of steroids for UAO, post -extubation ICU length of stay.   
Sedation level will be tracked as this is a potentia l confounding variable, as well as fluid 
balance, details about endotra cheal tubes, use of blood pressure medications, as well as 
procedures.    
4. Objective:  To obtain data regarding the pot ential difference between Trans pulmonary 
pressure guided PEEP management and management recommended by [CONTACT_234437] a PEEP/F iO2 titration table. Outcomes : TPP values on evidence based 
protocol determined PEEP, and that which would be needed to make TPP zero. This will 
be used to guide the development of another ventilator protocol based on TPP for 
eventual use in a randomized c ontrolled trial.   
5. Objective:  To determine the reproducibly of diaphragm ultrasound measurements 
between a trained provider with experience in ultrasound (M. Elkunovich), and the other 
study investigators. Outcome: inter -observer variability in DCA and Dia phragm thickness 
measurements between study investigators and [CONTACT_234442].  This will serve as 
feasibility data and training to ensure that the other investigators can perform these 
measurements for follow up studies.  After an initial training phase, e ach provider will be 
required to perform a minimum of [ADDRESS_283232]. Elkunovich, 
with DCA and DTe measurements required to be within +/ - 10% of [CONTACT_234442]’s 
values.   
 
Methods of Data Collection  
 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, [ADDRESS_283233] -protected  computer and any printouts will be stored in a 
locked cabinet in the office of the investigators.  Ultrasound images will be annotated in real 
time, and stored per -provider, uploaded wirelessly through the Qpath system (which is used for 
clinical point of care ultrasounds ).     
Study Termination  
 
The endpoints of the study for indi vidual patients will occur [ADDRESS_283234] all of the stated objectives. By [CONTACT_234438]  
1.  Refining esophageal manometry protocol : It is anticipated that 40% of patients will pass 
the initial SBT. This means that [ADDRESS_283235].  Based on preliminary analysis of the 20 
 
 
Effort of breathing guided ventilator management for children: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_234398]: March 2, [ADDRESS_283236] if the revised protocol attains high adherence.  
2. Software pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928] : Each patient  should receive at least [ADDRESS_283237] -processing program, allowing > [ADDRESS_283238] 
comparison.  
3. Magnitude of reduction: It is anticipated that the expected duration of MV for those with 
anticipated lengths > [ADDRESS_283239] deviation for length of ventilation to use in future calculatio ns.     
4. TPP separation:  It is anticipated that 20 patients should yield a minimum of 60 TPP 
measurements (average 3/patient) which can be used to identify a potential separation 
between PEEP recommended by [CONTACT_760], and that which would be recommended  by 
[CONTACT_234439].  From the preliminary data we have to date (approximately 9 patients), 
there appears to be an average separation of [ADDRESS_283240] 50% of the observations ( 95% Confidence Interval  40-60%) there would be a 
separation of at least 2  cmH 20, it would facilitate development of a protocol.   To achieve 
this level of confidence, we would need a minimum of 50 observations.  
5. NIV protocol: It is anticipated that 40% of patients who are extubated will be placed on 
NIV after extubation. This means that [ADDRESS_283241].

 6. Ultrasound:  For each provider the mean bias and precision of DCA and Dte 
measurements will be compared against [CONTACT_234443] hunovich’s with the requirements that the 
mean bias be no more than 10% , with precision in the range of +/ - 20%.

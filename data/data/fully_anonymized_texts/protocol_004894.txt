PRECIS
Chronic delta hepatitis is a serious form of chronic liver disease caused by [CONTACT_713308] D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major 
structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. Based on previous and ongoing clinical 
trials demonstrating effectiveness against HDV, we propose to treat 26 adult patients with 
chronic delta hepatitis using the combination of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) 
lonafarnib (LNF), the protease inhibitor ritonavir (RTV) and peginterferon lambda-
1a(lambda).  In this phase 2a open label study, the safety and antiviral effects of triple 
therapy with LNF, RTV and lambda for a period of 6 months. After dosing, all patients 
will be monitored for 24 weeks off therapy.  Nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy will be 
instituted/continued during this study to prevent the possibility of HBV reactivation/flare 
for the duration of participation in this clinical trial. Patients with quantifiable HDV RNA 
in serum will be enrolled. At each clinic visit, patients will be questioned about side 
effects, symptoms and quality of life, undergo focused physical examination, and have 
blood drawn for complete blood counts, HDV RNA, and routine liver tests (including 
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, and albumin). At the end of 
the treatment, patients will be admitted to the clinical center and will undergo repeat liver 
biopsy and HVPG measurements, repeat physical examination, assessment of symptoms 
(using a symptom scale questionnaire), complete blood counts, routine liver tests, and 
hepatitis B and D viral markers. The primary therapeutic endpoint will be a decline of 
HDV RNA viral titer of 2 logs at the end of therapy.  The primary safety endpoint will be 
the ability to tolerate the drugs at the prescribed dose for the full course of therapy. This 
clinical trial is designed as a phase 2a study assessing the antiviral activity, safety and 
tolerance of fixed doses of lonafarnib, ritonavir and peginterferon lambda.

BACKGROUND
Chronic Delta Hepatitis
The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is an incomplete RNA virus, which is composed of a 1.7 kb 
single-stranded circular genomic RNA, virally encoded small and large delta antigens, 
and a surrounding lipid envelope.1 HDV only infects persons who are also infected with 
hepatitis B virus (HBV), because its lipid envelope is embedded with HBV surface 
antigen (HBsAg).2–4The HBsAg envelope protein provided by [CONTACT_713309] a means for the virus to enter and exit the hepatocyte.   
HBV and its antigens are not necessary for the replication of HDV once it has entered the 
cell, but they are necessary for spread of the infection to other cells, the development of 
acute and chronic hepatitis D and transmission of delta hepatitis to others.[ADDRESS_970896] severe and dreaded form of human viral hepatitis.  HDV 
infection leads to chronic hepatitis in a high proportion of persons, is associated with 
progression to cirrhosis in 5 to 10 years in up to 80% of cases and poor outcomes.[ADDRESS_970897] shown a lack of efficacy of nucleos(t)ide 
analogues used in chronic HBV infection for chronic HDV. 8–10The American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines suggest therapy with 
alpha interferon for chronic HDV infection, however recent results have identified the 
need for alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In a large multicenter randomized clinical trial, the Hep-
Net/International Delta Hepatitis Intervention Trial (HIDIT-1), sustained HDV RNA 
clearance with interferon based therapy with or without adefovir for [ADDRESS_970898]-treatment 
relapse.11 Additionally, the Liver Diseases Branch of the NIDDK has recently published 
its long-term peginterferon HDV study, which evaluated increasing the doses of 
peginterferon (up to 360 mcg/wk) for up to 5 years.  In this study, only 39% achieved the 
primary endpoint of histological improvement or loss of serum HDV and HBsAg at 3 
4
years and at the end of the study, only 23% seroconverted HBsAg.[ADDRESS_970899] alpha 
interferon.15 The recommended treatment duration with peginterferon alfa- 2a in patients 
with chronic HBV is for 48 weeks.
Other approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713284] B include oral nucleoside/nucleotide 
analogues: lamivudine (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_54736]-HBV, 3TC), adefovir dispi[INVESTIGATOR_96471] (bis-POM PMEA, 
Hepsera), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread), entecavir (Baraclude), and L-
deoxythymidine (Telbivudine/LdT, Tyzeka). Currently, Entecavir or Tenofovir are 
considered first line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713284] B. 15These agents are potent inhibitors 
of the HBV polymerase and reduce serum levels of HBV DNA, which is usually 
followed by [CONTACT_713310]. 
Lamivudine monotherapy has been evaluated in chronic hepatitis D by [CONTACT_713311] (95-DK-199) and by [CONTACT_713312] [ADDRESS_970900].  Lamivudine resulted in rapid decreases in HBV DNA levels (which 
were low to begin with) but had no effect on HDV RNA levels, serum aminotransferase 
levels, or histology.  Similarly, short-term combination therapy of alpha interferon and 
lamivudine has been found to be largely ineffective.17 A possible use of lamivudine in 
chronic delta hepatitis, however, is the uncommon patient with high levels of HBV DNA.  
The pattern of high HBV DNA levels despi[INVESTIGATOR_713285] 20% of patients with this disease seen at the Clinical Center of the NIH.  
In these patients, inhibition of HBV may be important particularly because suppression of 
HDV RNA may be followed by [CONTACT_713313]. In 19 patients with 
HIV/HDV18 long term exposure to nucleotide analog tenofovir lead to significantly 
reduced HDV RNA in addition to completely suppressing HBV DNA13. In this current 
study, clinically approved nucleoside analogues for chronic HBV infection will be used 
to prevent the possibility of on-therapy and post-therapy HBV flares.  
Prenylation Inhibitors
Prenylation is a post-translational lipid modification that involves the covalent addition of 
either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl prenyl lipi[INVESTIGATOR_713286] 
5
cysteine residues at or near the C-terminus of proteins.1 These reactions are catalyzed by 
[CONTACT_32576] (FTase) or the geranylgeranyltransferases (GGTases).19,20 The 
substrate for FTase or GGTase I is a characteristic tetrapeptide found in the amino acid 
sequence of the protein referred to as a CXXX box motif (where C is a cysteine and X is 
one of the last three amino acids at the C-terminus of the protein).[ADDRESS_970901] of 
prenylation is to promote membrane association of the modified protein.  Prenylation also 
plays a major role in protein-protein interactions.20 
The novel idea of prenylation inhibition was originally developed as a therapeutic 
approach for cancer, as exemplified by [CONTACT_713314] (FTI) BZA-5B to 
prevent prenylation of the farnesylated oncogene RAS.19 Various phase I/II/III trials in 
oncology with FTIs have revealed a favorable side effect profile, with good safety and 
relative lack of toxicity, and ease of administration as they are taken orally.19
Prenylation Inhibitors in Chronic Delta Hepatitis
Prenylation plays a vital role in the viral life cycle of HDV, which allows for therapeutic 
opportunities for eradication.  The HDV genome has a single open-reading frame that can 
encode two proteins: a small or a large delta antigen.  The large delta antigen differs from 
the small one by [CONTACT_713315] 19 amino acids on its C-terminus. The production 
of small and large delta antigens is dependent upon editing of the HDV RNA to change 
the stop codon which ends the production of small delta antigen and allows “read 
through” to the next stop codon which produces the large delta antigen.  The small delta 
antigen is essential for genome replication, whereas the large delta antigen (LHDAg) 
performs other functions such as transactivation of various genes and mediation of 
assembly and release of HBsAg-enveloped particles.[ADDRESS_970902] on general 
protein synthesis; however, there was significant prenylation inhibition on the production 
of complete, infectious HDV virions.5 More recently, in an in vivo mouse model of HDV, 
these compounds were able to completely clear HDV viremia to below the limit of 
detection.5These results demonstrate that prenylation inhibitors can indeed effectively 
inhibit HDV viremia and may prove to be an important therapeutic target in patients with 
hepatitis D infection.  Lonafarnib is an orally bioavailable tricyclic farnesyltransferase 
inhibitor that is metabolized by [CONTACT_35233] P-450 (3A4) system and has been shown 
to have anti-tumor activity in various phase I, II and III trials and anti-HDV properties in 
preclinical models.  
[ADDRESS_970903]-in-humans for HDV proof-of-concept (POC) study, the Liver Diseases Branch 
of the NIDDK completed a phase 2a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
evaluating the safety and utility of the prenylation inhibitor, Lonafarnib (LNF) dosed for 
4 weeks, in patients with chronic HDV (12-DK-0046).  In this POC study, compared to 
patients who received placebo, patients receiving lonafarnib 100 mg orally twice daily for 
4 weeks experienced mean HDV RNA declines of 0.73 log IU/ml declines in serum 
(p=0.04) and patients who received lonafarnib 200 mg orally twice daily for 4 weeks 
experienced a 1.54 log IU/ml decline of HDV RNA in serum (p=0.002) (Figure 1).  Mean 
lonafarnib serum concentrations significantly correlated with mean change HDV RNA 
from baseline to the end of therapy (R2=0.76, p<0.0001) (Figure 2). As expected, since 
lonafarnib works on host machinery, there was no evidence of viral resistance. In the 
lonafarnib 100 mg BID group, side effects included mild nausea (25%), diarrhea (37.5%), 
anorexia (12.5%), and abdominal bloating (12.5%). In the lonafarnib 200 mg BID group, 
side effects included nausea (75%), diarrhea (75%), anorexia (62.5%), dyspepsia (75%), 
vomiting (37.5%), mean weight loss of 4kg (75%).  There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events nor serious adverse events.

After the completion of this study, colleagues from the University of Ankara Medical 
School performed a single center, phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_713287]-1 (LOnafarnib 
With and without Ritonavir in HDV-1) to further explore the utility of LNF in chronic 
HDV infected patients ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   This study was designed as a 7-arm, parallel, 
open-label clinical trial designed to dose 21 patients across 7 groups (3 patients per 
group) as follows: Group 1: LNF 200 mg BID for 12 weeks; Group 2: LNF 300 mg BID 
for 12 weeks; Group 3: LNF 100 mg TID for 8 weeks; Group 4: LNF 100 mg BID + 
ritonavir (RTV) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks; Group 5: LNF 100 mg BID + Pegylated 
interferon (PEG-IFN) alpha 2a 180 mcg weekly for 8 weeks; Group 6: LNF 200 mg BID 
+ PEG-IFN alpha 180 mcg weekly for 8 weeks; and Group 7: LNF 300 mg BID + PEG-
IFN alpha 180 mcg weekly for 8 weeks.
In this study, all subjects receiving LNF experienced an HDV RNA viral load decline.  In 
the LNF monotherapy groups (Group 1, 2 and 3), subjects in group [ADDRESS_970904]-treatment compared to baseline.  Group 3 subjects were discontinued at week 5 due 
to unforeseen circumstances related to drug supply, however demonstrated mean declines 
of 1.4 logs of HDV RNA at week 4.  The adverse events in the monotherapy groups 
(groups 1-3) were noted to be similar to what was demonstrated in the NIDDK POC 
study and were predominantly GI related (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea and weight loss).  
Adverse events were grade 1 and 2 (CTCAE), without any grade 3 or 4, and severity of 
AEs worsened with higher doses. 
In subjects that received LNF combination regimens, group 4 subjects (LNF 100 mg BID 
+ RTV 100 mg daily for 8 weeks) demonstrated 2.4 log reduction in HDV RNA after 4 
weeks of therapy and 3.2 log reduction after 8 weeks of therapy (Figure 3).  In addition to 
8
this viral decline, all subjects demonstrated normalization of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) levels while on therapy (Figure 4).  Compared to the same LNF dosing in the 
NIDDK POC study (group 1 – LNF 100 mg twice daily), subjects receiving the same 
dose with ritonavir boosting demonstrated higher mean serum LNF concentrations with 
resultant greater HDV RNA declines by [CONTACT_5875] 4 of therapy (Figure 5).

Mean LNF Serum Conc (ng/mL)
The remaining combination groups in this study (groups 5-7) received varying doses of 
LNF (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg daily with PEG-IFN alpha). Group 5 subjects receiving 
LNF 100 mg + PEG-IFN alpha 180 mcg weekly demonstrated a mean HDV RNA 
decline of 3 logs along with declines in ALT.  Unfortunately, higher doses of LNF (200 
and 300 mg daily) with PEG-IFN alpha in groups 6 and 7 were poorly tolerated and 
resulted in discontinuations in all subjects within 4 weeks of initiation.  Subjects 
receiving the lower dose of LNF in group 5 experienced grade 1 and 2 adverse events 
which was less severe than those in group 6 and 7 (Figure 6)
Figure 6: GI adverse events observed with different treatment regimens in the 
LOWR-1 study.
As a follow-up to the LOWR-1 study, the Ankara University School of Medicine initiated 
the LOWR-2 study which was a phase 2 dose-optimization study in hopes of identifying 
optimal combination regimens of LNF and RTV+/- PEG-IFN alpha.   This single center 
study evaluated dosing combinations of LNF + RTV with and without PEG-IFN alpha 
for 12, 24 or 48 weeks.  In this study, aside from the varying doses of LNF ranging from 
10
25 mg BID to 100 BID plus ritonavir, 20 subjects received LNF 25 mg (low dose) or 50 
mg (high dose) BID with RTV 100 mg BID for 24 or 48 weeks and 14 subjects received 
the same dosing (25 mg or 50 mg LNF BID + RTV 100 mg BID) with PEG-IFN alpha 
180 mcg weekly for 24 or 48 weeks.  In subjects that received therapy for 24 weeks, both 
low and high doses of LNF with RTV resulted in 5 of 14 subjects (36%) achieving an 
HDV RNA level below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and one subject 
achieving HDV RNA PCR negativity at week 24.  However, the response rates were 
notably improved with the addition of PEG-IFN alpha to the low and high doses of LNF 
with RTV (Figure 7), with 4 of 5 (80%) of patients achieving <LLOQ at week 24 and 3 
of 5 (60%) of patients becoming HDV RNA PCR negative at week 24.  Additionally, 60-
78% of subjects normalized their ALT levels at week 24.  Adverse events were 
predominantly grade [ADDRESS_970905] common side effects being nausea, diarrhea, 
fatigue, weight loss, anorexia and vomiting, similar to what was seen in the NIDDK POC 
and LOWR-1 studies.

In conjunction with the clinical trials performed at Ankara University, the Liver Diseases 
Branch, NIDDK recently completed the all-oral combination study (LOWR-3) which 
evaluated the safety and utility of once-daily ritonavir-boosted lonafarnib at doses of 50, 
75 and 100 mg once daily for 12 and 24 weeks (15-DK-0170). This phase 2a double-
blinded, placebo controlled, clinical trial randomized 21 patients into one of six groups: 
LNF 50, 75, or 100mg + RTV 100mg once daily for 24 weeks (12 patients) or 12 weeks 
of placebo followed by [CONTACT_713316] 50, 75, or 100mg + RTV 100mg once daily for 12 weeks (9 
patients). Additionally, all subjects were maintained or initiated on hepatitis B nucleoside 
analogue therapy to prevent the possibility of HBV related flares. After 12 weeks of 
therapy, median HDV RNA decline from baseline was 1.60 log IU/mL (LNF 50 mg), 
1.33 (LNF 75 mg) and 0.83 (LNF 100 mg) (p=0.001). In subjects treated for 24 weeks, 
HDV RNA levels significantly differed from placebo.  During the course of the study 6 
subjects achieved HDV RNA levels below 125 IU/mL where 3 were below the lower 
11
limit of quantification (<14 IU/mL) and 1 achieved HDV RNA negativity.  LNF serum 
concentrations correlated with ritonavir levels (R=0.45, p<0.0001). Adverse events were 
mild to moderate and included nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, anorexia, diarrhea, and 
weight loss and were all CTCAE grade 1 or 2.  There were no treatment discontinuations 
for adverse events.  (unpublished data- manuscript in process).
Ritonavir boosting of Lonafarnib
Through inhibition of metabolic enzymes including cytochrome P-[ADDRESS_970906] is achieved through 
ritonavir’s ability to inhibit the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme, thereby [CONTACT_713317], including area under the curve (AUC), maximum 
concentration, minimum concentration and half-life.22 The use of ritonavir as a 
therapeutic booster in patients with chronic liver disease and chronic hepatitis B and/or C 
have been evaluated successfully in multiple previous studies.23,24 In hepatitis C, one such 
successful example of the use of ritonavir with Danoprevir, which successfully enhanced 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of Danoprevir, thus allowing a lower dose of danoprevir 
and enabling higher plasma trough concentrations with lesser exposure to Danoprevir.25–
[ADDRESS_970907] lonafarnib levels has been 
demonstrated in the already completed HDV LOWR-1 (Figure 5 above), LOWR-2 and 
LOWR-3 (Figure 8 below) studies performed in Ankara, Turkey and the NIDDK.  The 
use of ritonavir boosted LNF has demonstrated the ability to substantially increase serum 
drug levels of LNF while minimizing the drug exposure to the gastrointestinal tract.  In 
the LOWR-3 study performed by [INVESTIGATOR_308024], the combination of LNF 
and RTV were well tolerated and safe for 24 weeks without electrocardiographic changes 
or pancreatitis.

In the LOWR-HDV-2 study in Ankara, Turkey, which evaluated differing doses of 
lonafarnib and ritonavir (LNF/RTV 100/50 mg twice daily, LNF/RTV 100/100 mg once 
daily, LNF/RTV 150/100 mg once daily and LNF/RTV 100/100 mg twice daily) for 3 
months, a mean HDV RNA decline >1.5 log IU/ml was demonstrated in 8 patients after 1 
month of therapy. Notably, the dosing of LNF/RTV 100/100 mg once daily showed a 
continuous HDV RNA decline with a mean decline of  >3log HDV RNA IU/ml . 
Therefore, ritonavir has demonstrated success as a pharmacokinetic booster of lonafarnib 
as it  optimizes the pharmacokinetic profile of lonafarnib while allowing for a lower dose 
(with less side effects) and still maintaining the antiviral activity of lonafarnib.
Peginterferon lambda therapy in chronic viral hepatitis
IFN-lambda is a type III of IFN with different structural features, receptor characteristics, 
and biological activities than IFN- (Type I). IFN-lambda was first reported in the early 
2000s28. IFN-lambdaand IFN- share the common interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 
induction pathway that leads to broad-spectrum antiviral activities (Figure 9). The 
biological activity of Lambda is derived from its recombinant human IFN λ1 moiety. 
Lambda binds to the human Type III IFN receptor leading to receptor dimerization. 
Receptor dimerization activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways 
initially mediated by [CONTACT_167193]/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription) pathway. 
13
Figure 9: Mechanism Action of Type I and Type III Interferons 
Lambda is a covalent conjugate of human recombinant non-pegylated  IFN lambda 
(IFN ) and a 20-kDa linear PEG chain. Lambda has been investigated extensively in the 
treatment of CHB and CHC, and is now being investigated in CHD.  
As of March 2017, over 3,700 subjects (including 237 healthy subjects; 197 subjects with 
HBV; 3,276 subjects with HCV; and 12 subjects with HDV) have received Lambda or 
comparator in [ADDRESS_970908] evaluated the 
antiviral activity of lambda IFN and chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection.  
In chronic HBV infection, lambda interferon was evaluated as monotherapy in a dose 
finding study in interferon naïve patients (LIRA-B)22.  Subjects were randomized to 
receive weekly lambda 180 or 240 µg or interferon alpha at 180 µg for 48 weeks.  The 
240 µg dose was discontinued for development during the study and only 13 patients 
received this dose.  Hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion rates were comparable for 
interferon lambda and alpha groups at week 48 (17.5% versus 16.9%, respectively) 
however lambda noninferiority was not met at week [ADDRESS_970909]-treatment. (13.8% versus 
30.1%, respectively; lambda versus alpha 80% CI).  Lambda was well tolerated at single 
subcutaneous doses of up to 5 mcg/kg and multiple subcutaneous doses of up to 180 µg 
administered weekly for 48 weeks.  Interestingly, known side-effects of interferon alpha 
(constitutional symptoms, neurologic events, flulike symptoms, musculoskeletal 
symptoms, and psychiatric events) were lower in the interferon lambda 180 ug group 
(50%) compared to the IFN alpha group (72.3%).  
The antiviral activity of lambda interferon against HCV has had the most extensive 
patient experience amounting to >[ADDRESS_970910] ranged from 24-48 weeks and lambda interferon dosing has  ranged from 
80, 120, 184 to 240 µg per week23,24.  In patients with HCV genotype 1 and 4 infection, 
14
there was a significant relationship between lambda exposure (based on AUC or C Max) 
and undetectable HCV RNA at week 4, with the largest difference between ages and dose 
levels between the 120 and 180 µg exposure ranges. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_713288].  Based on promising phase 2 
HCV studies, phase 3 studies in chronic HCV infection were performed evaluating fixed 
180 µg doses of lambda in combination with Ribavirin and daclatasvir and telaprevir for 
24–48 weeks in genotype is ¼ infection and 12–24 weeks in genotype 2/3 infection31.
In general, lambda interferon has been generally well tolerated by [CONTACT_713318]. Compared to alpha interferon, there is a lower frequency of musculoskeletal 
(myalgia, arthralgia, and back pain) and flu-like symptoms (chills, pyrexia, and pain) and 
a notable lack of hematologic toxicity in the WBC or platelet lineages in subjects 
receiving Lambda interferon based regimens.  Laboratory abnormalities have generally 
been of low grade and self-limited. When study regimens included concomitant RBV 
administration, decreases in hemoglobin levels were observed as expected; however, 
anemia was less frequent and milder with Lambda/RBV than with alfa/RBV. 
Hematologic toxicity was also reported less frequently in groups treated with Lambda 
compared with alfa.
Lambda Inteferon in Chronic HDV Infection
Lambda has demonstrated in vivo activity against hepatitis D and hepatitis B viruses. In 
an HBV/HDV-infected human liver chimeric mouse model, Lambda reduced HDV and 
HBV viremia by 1.2-log and serum HBsAg level by 2.5-fold after 4 weeks of treatment.24 
The 4 weeks of Lambda treatment also decreased intrahepatic genomic/antigenomic 
HDV RNA by 6.1/2.2-fold and intrahepatic HBV RNA by 8.6-fold in the mice. 
In a first-in-humans for HDV, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial, Lambda interferon 
monotherapy is currently being explored (NCT:02765802) in New Zealand, Pakistan and 
Israel.  The Lambda Interferon MonoTherapy study (LIMT) study, has completed 
enrollment and initiation of dosing in [ADDRESS_970911]-therapy follow-up.  At the AASLD liver meeting in October 2017, the 
study investigators reported interim results 32 describing that 10 of 33 patients had 
reached 24 weeks of therapy.  6 of 10 patients were responders, achieving >/= 2 log 
decline or below the lower limit of quantitation in HDV RNA at week 24 (Figure 9).  
Preliminary results also demonstrated that lambda interferon had comparable anti-HDV 
activity to historical peginterferon alpha at 24 weeeks of therapy.  These preliminary 
results appear comparable to peginterferon alpha therapy at similar time points where 15 
of 91 subjects (16%) achieved HDV RNA negativity by [CONTACT_5875] 8 and 19 of 91 subjects 
(21%) achieved HDV RNA negativity by [CONTACT_5875] [ADDRESS_970912] included grade 3 elevations in ALT in 3 patients and 
jaundice in 3 patients, two of which required permanent drug discontinuation and 1 
required temporary interruption and resumption at a reduced dose. Constitutional 
symptoms were much milder and less frequent than historical data with IFN alfa.

Figure 9: Mean viral load change from baseline to week [ADDRESS_970913] described that 
the existence of cirrhosis (regardless of etiology) is associated with microbial dysbiosis 
and changes in intestinal microbial composition.  Specifically, in patients with cirrhosis, 
pathogenic species appear to be more likely to translocate across the gut wall34. 
In addition to the data in cirrhotic patients, emerging data suggests bacterial translocation 
(BT) may occur at earlier stages of compensated liver disease and can also contribute to 
progression of liver disease. Kupffer cells (KC) express Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) that 
are highly sensitive to lipopolysacharide LPS-triggered TLR activation. Additionally, 
KC, are also potent activators of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which play a vital role in 
hepatic fibrogenesis. 35 In an in vivo mouse model, Seki et al reported a mechanism that 
promotes the pro-fibrogenic response where LPS binds to TLR-4 on the HSC which, in 
turn, leads to KC chemotaxis as well as to sensitization of HSC to TGF-β signaling.36 
Henao-Mejia and Elinav in another landmark study described that bacterial translocation 
through TLR-4 and TLR-9 dependent pathways drove non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
16
(NAFLD) and its progression to steatohepatitis37. These and other studies outline the role 
of microbial products in activation of key intracellular events involved in liver 
inflammation and fibrosis, thus conceptually establishing a link between BT to the portal 
system and liver disease progression. Other studies have also suggested that BT to the 
systemic circulation may occur in earlier stages of liver fibrosis. 38,39 In the serum of 
chronic hepatitis B and C patients in different stages of liver fibrosis, elevated levels of 
soluble CD14 (sCD14), a macrophage-derived marker of LPS bioreactivity were 
identified. 45 In addition, evidence of portosystemic shunting and decreased Kupffer cell 
function was described in pre-cirrhotic HCV patients using highly sensitive quantitative 
liver function tests and SPIO-MRI imaging respectively27,40.
Microbiome diversity and bacterial translocation in chronic HDV patients has not been 
described in the literature. We plan to assess the fecal microbiota diversity and its 
bacterial translocation in chronic hepatic D (HDV) and their changes during treatment 
with lonafarnib, ritonavir and lambda. The initial focus would be to recapi[INVESTIGATOR_713289].

STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS
Study Procedures
Physician Visit – history and physical, vital signs, review of symptoms, 
concomitant medications, symptom questionnaire and review of medication 
compliance while on treatment. 
History and Physical – 
oFull H&P : A full history and physical examination will be performed at 
the screening visit as well as inpatient visits. 
oInterim H&P : An interim history and physical covering liver and 
medication related symptoms as well as a limited physical exam will be 
performed during all other visits. 
Concomitant medication query (including dose and indication for each).  
Documentation of concomitant medication, which may be CYP3A, 2C9, and P-gp 
substrates, will be performed.
Hepatitis B Treatment To prevent the possibility of a hepatitis B flare during the 
study, all patients will be treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues while on the study 
(24 weeks of entacavir or tenofovir + lonafarnib/ritonavir/lambda and [ADDRESS_970922]-therapy monitoring phase). Patients who are 
not on nucleos(t)ide analogues prior to starting lonafarnib/ritonavir/lambda will 
be started on either entecavir or tenofovir (which are first-line nucleos(t)ide 
analogues recommended by [CONTACT_713323]) 
prior to instituting HDV therapy (to reduce the risk of a hepatitis B flare). HBV 
viral loads will be monitored after starting nucleoside analogue therapy at each 
outpatient visit during the entire course of study participation.  Adequate HBV 
suppression (serum HBV DNA level <20 IU/mL or undetectable) must be 
achieved on nucleoside analogue therapy prior to starting HDV therapy which 
will allow for improved determination of response to experimental HDV therapy.  
Patients will be informed about the possible adverse effects of these medications 
during their pretreatment clinic visits and via the package insert that is provided 
with the medication.  Patients will also be offered multiple opportunities to ask 
questions about these medications during their clinic visits. For patients started on 
20
nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy as a result of their participation in this protocol, 
the medication will be administered under this protocol after the consent has been 
signed and eligibility is determined. If the patient has been taking a nucleos(t)ide 
analogue prior to enrolling in this study, the specific nucleos(t)ide(s) analogue 
will be continued. The currently approved nucleoside analogues for hepatitis B 
include: lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, entecavir and telbivudine.20   At the 
conclusion of participation in this study, subjects that were prescribed nucleoside 
analogue therapy by [CONTACT_713324] (if 
clinically indicated) and they will receive this therapy from their outside 
physicians.  For subjects that are started on nucleoside analogue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713292], nucleoside analogue therapy may be 
continued after completion of this study if clinically indicated.  If this is the case, 
therapy will be continued under the 91-DK-0214 protocol, with encouragement 
that therapy should be received from their outside physicians.  Otherwise, if not 
clinically indicated, nucleoside therapy will be discontinued at the conclusion of 
participation in this study.   
Symptom Questionnaire provides information on categorical presence of 
symptoms as well as their severity, pattern and frequency (Appendix 1)
EKG – Patients will undergo electrocardiogram (EKG) evaluations collected in 
digital format due to the rare instances of asymptomatic bradycardia, PR 
prolongation48 and QT/QTc interval prolongation described in oncologic trials 
with use of lonafarnib.48, 49  
Imaging
oUltrasound and Fibroscan -  An abdominal ultrasound with sheer wave 
elastography and vibration controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan ®) 
will be performed for clinical staging of liver disease and to evaluate for 
hepatocellular carcinoma, masses or any other findings that may preclude 
a safe transjugular liver biopsy with hepatic venous pressure gradient 
measurements.  
oMRI A structural examination of the liver will be performed via magnetic 
resonance imaging with gadolinium. An MRI without contrast will be 
performed in the event that contrast cannot be administered.
Liver Biopsy with Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) 
Measurements
oTransjugular Liver Biopsy with HVPG : A transjugular liver biopsy 
will be performed in the interventional radiology suite with measurement 
of hepatic venous pressure gradient. If size of core during one pass 
permits, a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_713293] -80 C for further 
analysis.
oPercutaneous Liver Biopsy – in the event that the transjugular liver 
biopsy cannot be performed (ie: technical difficulty), a percutaneous liver 
biopsy will be performed. 
21
Consults
oReproductive - A reproductive endocrinology or urological consultation 
for evaluation of current and future reproductive potential, the potential of 
reversibility in the event that reproductive toxicity occurs, and guidance 
on potential contraceptive methods will be obtained. Sperm samples will 
be obtained, wherever possible, based on the recommendations of the 
consult.  Sperm sampling will be offered and if obtained, given that the 
normal spermatogenesis cycle is [ADDRESS_970923] prior to starting therapy.
oOpthalmologic – an ophthalmogic evaluation including vision testing as 
well as retinal exams will be performed. 
Medication Compliance Assessment Compliance with drug dosing will be 
monitored through patient diaries and pi[INVESTIGATOR_713294].  Patients will 
be asked to complete drug diaries as they take their study medication including 
the date and time. They will be asked to bring unused medication with them and 
the residual pi[INVESTIGATOR_713295]. If compliance falls below 90%, the 
patient will be counseled about the importance of complying with drug therapy 
and made aware that if compliance falls below 80% their participation in the 
study may end.  If compliance falls eblow 80%, the patient may be withdrawn 
from the study.  Reasons for non-compliance will be assessed and documented in 
the patients record.
LABORATORY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS
Baseline Labs - prothrombin time (PT/INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), 
reticulocyte count, plasma haptoglobin level, anti-HBc.
Routine Labs - complete blood count (CBC with differential), acute care panel 
(sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, glucose, urea nitrogen, 
eGFR ), mineral panel (albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus), hepatic panel 
(alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin), lipid panel 
(total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL), LDH, CK, serum uric acid and total 
protein, urinalysis. 
Monthly Labs - PT, thyroid panel, pregnancy test
Serology Labs - HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe, anti-HDV, 
quantitative HBsAg levels.
Pancreatitis Monitoring: amylase, lipase
Viral Kinetic and Pharmacokinetic Assessment (VK and PK): includes HDV 
RNA and HBV DNA qualitative tests via polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) 
or a quantitative PCR (qPCR) for viral titer.  One red top tube (10 mL) will be 
obtained and stored in -80 for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of lonafarnib, 
ritonavir and lambda.  
22
Reproductive Panel - In males, AM levels of inhibin B, luteinizing hormone 
(LH), total and free testosterone, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) will be 
obtained. In females, AM levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, 
progesterone, antimullerian hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 
dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA), dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_21907] (DHEAS), 
testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone 
(17-OHP) will be obtained.
Immunological Studies -  30 - 50 ml of whole blood will be collected for 
immunological studies at specified time points described in table 1.    5 mm of 
liver tissue at baseline and end of therapy will also be collected for 
immunological studies, provided sufficient liver tissue is available after the 
required amount is obtained for histopathology.  An additional pass will not be 
performed to obtain additional tissue for immunological studies.
Research Blood for Storage - 7 ml of serum will be collected and stored at -80 
C in the NIDDK clinical core lab. 
Fecal Microbiome and Bacterial Translocation (BT) analysis - we plan to utilize pyro-
sequencing techniques to survey microbial diversity in patients’ fecal samples. Patients 
may refuse the microbiome portion of the study and still participate in other portions of 
this study.  Prior to stool sample collection, all the patients will continue their routine 
diets.  At each visit, a specific medication history (including prescription and OTC 
medications) and dietary recordings (appendix 2) will be taken. Samples (stool and 
serum) will be elicited at the time points shown in Table 2 and stored in -80C for future 
analysis.
SPECIMEN PREPARATION, HANDLING AND STORAGE
When appropriate, blood will be drawn in pediatric tubes and the amount of blood that 
will be drawn from adult patients (i.e., those persons 18 years of age or older) for 
research purposes shall not exceed NIH Clinical Center rules over any eight-week period.  
HDV RNA testing will be done by [CONTACT_956]. Quantification will be 
performed at The Doctors Laboratories (TDL).  TDL has performed the HDV 
RNA quantification for previous lonafarnib studies including LOWR-1 through 
LOWR-4 and the LIMT (lambda interferon for HDV) study.  There currently is a 
lack of standardization across available HDV RNA quantitative assays and no 
commercially approved assay exists in the [LOCATION_002]. The lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) for this test is 14 IU/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) 
is 2 IU/mL . If the test does not detect the virus, the result will be reported as 
“<LLOQ, target not detected.” If the test detects the presence of the virus but was 
not able to accurately quantify the number of copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the result will be reported as 
“<LLOQ, target detected.”.  
HBV DNA will be tested at the NIH Clinical Center utilizing the COBAS 
Ampliprep/COBAS Taqman HBV v2.[ADDRESS_970924], which is an FDA approved assay 
intended for the use as an aid in the management of chronic HBV infection.  
23
Resistance monitoring will include determination of baseline isolate sequence 
analysis to enable identification and monitoring of changes in viral genome 
sequences as a function of treatment duration. Analysis of drug-treated patients 
will enable an assessment of background genomic variability. Any clinical 
evidence of breakthrough or rebound (defined as a greater than 1 log increase 
above an observed viral load nadir or HDV RNA that becomes quantifiable 
following a reduction to <LLOQ, target not detected) will prompt a more in-depth 
analysis that will focus first on the region encoding the CXXX box, as changes in 
the prenylation substrate sequence represent a logical potential mechanism of 
escape from prenylation-inhibiting drugs such as lonafarnib. Because other 
unanticipated mechanisms of resistance could theoretically be operative, however, 
we would anticipate also performing full genome sequencing to enable maximally 
unbiased assessment for candidate resistance mutations. Samples for analysis of 
potential host polymorphisms in the farnesyl transferase gene wil be collected 
from all subjects.  We will also have the ability to engineer any identified 
candidate resistance mutation back into an HDV vector competent for in vitro 
replication, in order to confirm that the mutation is indeed causative of any 
suspected decreased sensitivity to lonafarnib.
Immunological Studies – 
oChronic delta hepatitis is characterized by a lymphomononuclear infiltrate 
of the liver.  The relative composition of this cellular infiltrate (HDV-
specific T cells versus HBV-specific T cells versus nonspecific by[CONTACT_713325]), the antigenic targets within HDV that are recognized by [CONTACT_75327] T 
cells and the contribution of the HDV-specific T cell response to disease 
progression are not known.  
oWe aim to define the HDV-specific T cell response in blood samples of 
HDV/HBV-coinfected patients in the chronic stage of disease prior to 
treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated 
from blood samples.  The HDV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell response to 
recombinant delta antigen will be assessed by [CONTACT_199932] (IFN, 
TNF, IL-2) by [CONTACT_713326]-linked 
immunospot assays.  Individual responses will be mapped with [ADDRESS_970925] 
identified in a rare case of a patient who spontaneously recovered from 
HDV infection (Heller, Rehermann, unpublished).   
24
Fecal Microbiome and Bacterial Translocation (BT) Bacterial DNA will be 
extracted from patient serum and stool using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Patients’ dietary history of the day prior 
to stool sample collection and any changes made in medication use since 
screening visit will be recorded.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a 
conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene will be performed with two universal 
primers, forward primers (27F-Bac, 5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) and 
reverse primers (543R-Bac, 5’-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC-3’) to detect and 
identify the bacterial DNA. For each sample, uniquely barcoded universal primers 
will be used for multiplexing. Amplified PCR products will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_713327]. Amplicons 
will undergo deep sequencing to be performed at SAIC-Frederick Inc. Sequences 
with a minimum length of 200 bp will be analyzed using mothur (version 1.21.0) 
for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Taxonomic classification will be done 
using the RDP Classifier and phylogenetic tree will be generated using the 
Clearcut program. Blood will be drawn and used to measure microbial cell wall 
products, (LPS, peptidoglycan and beta-D-glucan), host response markers and 
selected cytokines. 
Specimen Shipment
Specimens will be shipped using Federal Express in insulated and refrigerated specimen 
boxes.

Unscheduled Visits
Data from unscheduled visits may be used in the study analysis.  Unscheduled visits may 
occur due to the development of unexpected symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, or side 
effects which may require clinical follow-up outside of the scheduled visits.  Additional 
evaluations, including laboratory, radiologic and EKG evaluations may be performed 
based on presenting symptoms or clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798].
Remote Visits
In the event that circumstances beyond our control preclude the travel of one or more of 
the study participants to the NIH Clinical Center for a visit, or otherwise would put their 
health at greater risk (i.e. epi[INVESTIGATOR_696145]), we will endeavor to establish 
capabilities for remote visits. Specifically, for safety visits, the study team will arrange 
for local laboratory studies to be done, which include comprehensive metabolic panel, 
Liver function tests (including Tbili, AST and ALT), CBC with diff, PT/INR, HBV DNA 
quantitative and HDV quantitative measurements and conduct a telehealth visit with the 
patient. This telehealth visit will adhere to HHS guidance 
(https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/emergency-
preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-telehealth/index.html) and can use all 
telehealth modalities under the good faith provision during a pandemic/epi[INVESTIGATOR_713296]. Unscheduled visits, due to safety, may 
also be conducted remotely through telehealth and/or offsite laboratory and radiologic 
studies and/or in conjunction with a local physician with the supervision of the study PI. 
The laboratory studies will be performed through Quest or LabCorp or with the local 
physician, and results will be sent to the study team for safety monitoring and 
[ADDRESS_970930] research blood at these visits to be sent to the NIH Clinical Center when possible, 
to address study outcome measures. During a pandemic affecting patient travel, serial 
missed research collections will not be considered major study deviations and will be 
reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.
Monitoring of Patients Discontinuing Therapy
Therapy will be stopped for intolerance to lonafarnib, ritonavir and/or lambda (which is 
carefully defined in table 4). Patients who stop therapy due to intolerance, withdraw 
because of an adverse event, self-discontinue therapy or drop out from the study will be 
considered as treatment failures. Patients in whom therapy is stopped early or who 
discontinue treatment on their own will initially be followed in the same manner as those 
who do not respond as defined in the protocol.  After treatment is discontinued, the 
patient will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_970931] participated in studies done by [CONTACT_713328].

Fecal microbiome and Bacterial Translocation (BT) analysis
With the recent introduction of highly sensitive analytical methods, the ability to 
meticulously describe the intestinal microbiome in health and disease has allowed for 
identification of fecal microbial dysbiosis.  More recently, investigators have begun 
evaluating associations between the fecal microbiome and bacterial translocation in 
chronic liver disease, advanced liver disease and its potential contribution in poor 
outcomes in liver disease. 
In this study, for research related purposes, we plan to utilize pyro-sequencing techniques 
to survey microbial diversity in patients’ fecal samples. Patients may refuse the 
microbiome portion of the study and still participate in other portions of this study.  Prior 
to stool sample collection, all the patients will continue their routine diets.  At each visit, 
a specific medication history (including prescription and OTC medications) and dietary 
recordings (appendix 2) will be taken. Samples (stool and serum) will be elicited at the 
time points shown in Table 2 and stored in -80C for future analysis.Testosterone

At the time of analysis, we intend to evaluate the relationship between specific 
microbiome maps and the occurrence of BT. In addition, species homology between 
blood and fecal samples will be determined by [CONTACT_223883]. 
Bacterial DNA will be extracted from patient serum and stool using QIAamp DNA mini 
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Patients’ dietary history of the day 
prior to stool sample collection and any changes made in medication use since screening 
visit will be recorded.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for a conserved region of the 
16S rRNA gene will be performed with two universal primers, forward primers (27F-
Bac, 5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’) and reverse primers (543R-Bac, 5’-
ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC-3’) to detect and identify the bacterial DNA. For each 
sample, uniquely barcoded universal primers will be used for multiplexing. Amplified 
PCR products will be analyzed by [CONTACT_713329]. Amplicons will undergo deep sequencing to be performed at SAIC-
Frederick Inc. Sequences with a minimum length of 200 bp will be analyzed using 
mothur (version 1.21.0) for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Taxonomic classification 
will be done using the RDP Classifier and phylogenetic tree will be generated using the 
Clearcut program. Stool samples will be collected at the beginning of study, every [ADDRESS_970932] treatment. (Table  2)
Blood will be drawn and used to measure microbial cell wall products, (LPS, 
peptidoglycan and beta-D-glucan), host response markers and selected cytokines. This 
blood samples will be collected whenever we collect the stool sample. (Table 2).

Immunologic Analysis
Chronic delta hepatitis is characterized by a lymphomononuclear infiltrate of the liver.  
The relative composition of this cellular infiltrate (HDV-specific T cells versus HBV-
specific T cells versus nonspecific by[CONTACT_145111]), the antigenic targets within HDV that 
34
are recognized by [CONTACT_75327] T cells and the contribution of the HDV-specific T cell response 
to disease progression are not known.  
We aim to define the HDV-specific T cell response in blood samples of HDV/HBV-
coinfected patients in the chronic stage of disease prior to treatment. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be isolated from blood samples.  The HDV-specific CD4 
and CD8 T cell response to recombinant delta antigen will be assessed by [CONTACT_713330] (IFN, TNF, IL-2) by [CONTACT_713326]-linked 
immunospot assays.  Individual responses will be mapped with [ADDRESS_970933] identified in a rare case of a patient who spontaneously recovered from 
HDV infection (Heller, Rehermann, unpublished).   
Design of the Trial/Statistical considerations
This study is designed as a phase 2a FDA regulated clinical study evaluating the utility of 
combination triple therapy of lonafarnib, ritonavir and lambda interferon in patients with 
chronic HDV infection. This study should show if HDV suppression is possible; assist in 
suggesting if this dose is effective for viral suppression; and how well lonafarnib, 
ritonavir and lambda interferon are tolerated. Thus, assessment of virologic response is 
the primary therapeutic endpoint and safety/tolerability is the primary safety endpoint.   
Measurement of HDV RNA levels will be performed in two batches, the first batch will 
be analysed after the last patient has completed treatment, and the second batch when the 
last patient completes post-therapy follow-up. 
In order to achieve a primary virologic response goal of a 2-log decline in HDV RNA in 
serum at end of [ADDRESS_970934] size was found to be -1.1.  
𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 =2672.231 ―267223.1 
240500.8=―1.1
Based off prior interferon based studies, we would also include a potential drop out rate 
of 30%.  Thus, the sample size desired will be [ADDRESS_970935] between 30-32 venipuncture during their course of participation.  The 
amount of blood that will be drawn from adult patients (i.e., those persons 18 
years of age or older) for research purposes shall not exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 
mL, whichever is smaller, over any eight-week period.
2.The risks and hazards of liver biopsy. Patients will undergo liver biopsy as part of 
this study (as described above).  The major side effects of liver biopsy are pain, 
infection and bleeding. 
a.Transjugular Liver Biopsy: Localized neck pain, hematoma and bleeding 
are reported in 6.5% of patients that undergo transjugular liver biopsy.50 
This is transient (lasting one to twelve hours) and is usually mild, rarely 
requiring analgesics. Severe pain requiring prolongation of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713297] [ADDRESS_970936] 
been reported to be punctured during routine liver biopsies include lung, 
colon, gall bladder, kidney, or adrenal gland. Bacteremia occurs in 1-2% 
of persons undergoing liver biopsy.  In the absence of bile duct 
obstruction, this is almost always self-limited and is rarely symptomatic.  
Significant bleeding after liver biopsy is the most serious side effect of this 
procedure.  In the absence of a blood coagulation defect or hepatic 
malignancy, significant bleeding is rare, occurring in less than one in a 
thousand cases of liver biopsy.  A transjugular liver biopsy will not be 
performed if patients have evidence of coagulopathy unresponsive to 
vitamin K (INR >1.5) or low platelets (Platelets < 50,000 k/uL) which 
may place them at a potentially higher risk for bleeding.  Death due to 
bleeding after liver biopsy has been reported to occur in less than [ADDRESS_970937] been 2 reported complications. One of the complications was bile 
leak that required endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) and stenting to fix the leak. The patient recovered without long-
term sequelae. After this, the technique of transjugular liver biopsy at the 
clinical center was changed to minimize the risk of this happening again. 
A second patient developed mild itching after intravenous contrast 
administration. This resolved with Benadryl administration and the 
procedure was completed without further complication. Patients will be 
monitored for [ADDRESS_970938] presence of a 
leak. If this occurs, appropriate intervention will be performed. 
b.Percutaneous Liver Biopsy: In this protocol, it is intended that most 
patients will undergo a transjugular liver biopsy.  However, there may be 
rare instances when a transjugular liver biopsy cannot be performed for 
technical reasons.  An example of this would be due to rare anatomical 
variations of the hepatic vein that do not allow for advancement of the 
liver biopsy needle and catheter into a suitable position for acquisition of 
[ADDRESS_970939] evidence 
of coagulopathy unresponsive to vitamin K (INR >1.5) or low platelets 
(Platelets < 75,000 k/uL) which may place them at a potentially higher 
risk for bleeding. As such, the transjugular liver biopsy, percutaneous liver 
biopsy and HVPG measurements will be described in depth (along with 
the intended choice to perform either the transjugular liver biopsy or 
percutaneous liver biopsy) to the patient with an opportunity to ask 
questions prior to the intended schedule procedure.  The required NIH 
Clinical Center procedural consents will also be completed for all 
procedures as well.   
A thorough description of the percutaneous liver biopsy and its hazards 
and discomforts will also be included in the general consent form for 
patient reference as well.  A percutaneous liver biopsy is performed by 
[CONTACT_713331][INVESTIGATOR_713298], through the intercostal muscles and 
into the liver.  The needle is quickly withdrawn applying suction pressure.  
Local anesthesia as well as sedation (usually with midazolam) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_21997].  The biopsy is done with the patient lying on his/her back with the 
right arm above the head.  Sterile technique is used and the optimal site for 
the biopsy is chosen on the basis of physical examination for maximal 
liver dullness as well as ultrasound to demonstrate the position of the liver, 
gall bladder, and kidneys.  The biopsy itself is done using an in-and-out 
motion with the needle being in the liver for less than one second.  
However, the biopsy requires approximately 30 minutes of preparation 
and monitoring of blood pressure and pulse regularly over the next 12-24 
hours.  In clinical practice, liver biopsies are usually done as an outpatient 
procedure; in the Liver Diseases Branch, we prefer to keep the patient 
overnight after the biopsy.  The major hazards and discomforts of 
percutaneous liver biopsy are pain, fainting, bacteremia, puncture of 
another internal organ, and bleeding.  The discussion below is supported 
by [CONTACT_713332].  At the NIH, Medical Staff Fellows or Senior Staff of the Liver 
Diseases Branch, all of who are fully trained and credentialed in 
performing liver biopsies, performs liver biopsies.  Furthermore, all liver 
biopsies by [CONTACT_713333] a member of the Senior Staff.  The staff are quite proficient 
at liver biopsy technique since an average of 2 to 10 liver biopsies are 
done each month.  Two of the complications of liver biopsy can be 
considered common (pain and fainting), the remaining are quite rare 
(bacteremia, puncture of another organ, severe bleeding).  (1) Local pain 
and discomfort at the liver biopsy site occurs in about 20% of persons 
37
undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy.  This is transient (lasting one to 
twelve hours) and is usually mild, rarely requiring analgesics.  (2) Fainting 
or a vasovagal attack occurs in about 2% of patients undergoing liver 
biopsy.  Patients who faint after liver biopsy are typi[INVESTIGATOR_713299].  The vasovagal attack 
occurs within 1 to 2 minutes of the biopsy and can occur even in a 
completely sedated patient (who appears to be asleep). Serious 
complications of vasovagal attacks have not been reported but they can be 
quite distressing to the patient and staff.  (3) Asymptomatic bacteremia 
occurs in 1-2% of persons undergoing liver biopsy.  In the absence of bile 
duct obstruction, this is almost always self-limited and is rarely 
symptomatic. Of [ADDRESS_970940] 36 
years, omplications occurred in 135 (4%) biopsies with 33 (1%) resulting 
in major complications. Severe pain occurred in 78 (2.3%) subjects and 
bleeding occurred in 21 (0.6%) subjects. Biliary injury occurred in 8 
(0.2%) biopsies. Three subjects died as a result of massive intraperitoneal 
bleeding.41 
3.The risks of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements: The 
hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) will be measured during transjugular 
liver biopsy as a combined procedure in patients that participate in this study. 
Portal pressure measurements will not be performed if the patient has evidence of 
coagulopathy unresponsive to vitamin K (INR >1.5) or low platelets (Platelets < 
50,000 k/uL) which may place them at a potentially higher risk for bleeding. 
Portal pressure measurements will be repeated at the end of therapy (week 24).  
This will be done as a direct measure for portal hypertension and is expected to 
provide a more dynamic, functional assay of the direction of change in liver 
disease to follow the evolution of disease and the need for additional clinical 
intervention. Portal pressure measurements were initially used as a diagnostic test 
for portal hypertension and as part of the work up of patients with chronic liver 
diseases.52 Normal gradients are less than 5mmHg. It is accepted that decreasing 
the gradient to 12 mmHg or less will prevent variceal bleeding. It has also become 
clear that portal pressures convey prognostic information, which is an 
independent predictor of mortality in patients with liver disease related to 
cirrhosis.42–[ADDRESS_970941] for measuring portal 
pressures.
Hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements are typi[INVESTIGATOR_713300]. They are normally performed as combined procedures 
along with a liver biopsy to further aid in staging of liver disease.  Aside from the 
38
inherent risks of each individual procedure (percutaneous liver biopsy or 
transjugular liver biopsy or portal pressure measurements), there is no published 
added risk (in adults or pediatrics) in performing the combined procedure of 
portal pressure measurements with a liver biopsy. We are not aware of any series 
describing complications of this technique in detail. It is a technique that the 
clinical center interventional radiologists have considerable experience with, as it 
is essentially cannulation of a central vein. Furthermore, the remainder of the 
procedure is very similar to venous sampling, a technique used to locate 
endocrine tumors, again a common procedure at the clinical center. At the clinical 
center interventional radiology practice involves central venous cannulation and is 
done under ultrasound guidance and not the Seldinger technique. As such it is 
expected that complications at the puncture site would be less common.  
The most likely, although rare, risks of portal pressure measurement are bleeding, 
thrombosis, and arrhythmias. Other complications are far less likely. It is 
estimated that the most likely complications would, at most, occur in less than 5% 
of procedures and the less likely complications would, at most, occur in less than 
1% of procedures. 
a) Bleeding is most likely to occur at the site of catheterization and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_96684] a hematoma. It can occur at the time of the procedure or a 
few hours later (rebleeding). Very rarely the measurement catheter can tear or 
rupture the vein internally and cause internal bleeding. This may necessitate 
surgical repair or transfusion. 
b) Thrombosis occurs as a result of introducing a catheter into a vessel 
and is uncommon. Anticoagulants can be given during the procedure at the 
discretion of the radiologist, however this increases the risk of bleeding. 
Anticoagulants can be used to treat thrombosis, if necessary, and also rarely 
thrombolytics. 
c) Arrhythmias are caused by [CONTACT_713334]. Patients will be monitored throughout the procedure 
by [CONTACT_605559]. Arrhythmias are usually aborted just by [CONTACT_713335] a less sensitive area. Should abnormal rhythms persist they will be 
treated appropriately. 
d) Highly unlikely risks include the introduction of infection, pain, 
pneumothorax, arterial puncture, vocal cord paralysis, compression of adjacent 
structures by a hematoma, pseudoaneurysim formation, cardiac rupture, cardiac 
tamponade, and death. 
4. Risk of ionizing radiation: The only exposure to radiation in this study is from 
fluoroscopy which will be utilized during the transjugular liver biopsy and portal 
pressure measurements. The potential amount of radiation to be received in this 
study is 2.5 rem that is below the guideline of 5 rem per year allowed for adult 
research subjects by [CONTACT_110712].
5. The risks and discomfort of vibration controlled transient elastography 
(Fibroscan®): The Fibroscan® procedure is very similar to a regular ultrasound 
39
examination and both are considered to be procedures with less than minimal risk 
to patients. Fibroscan® measures how quickly the wave is transmitted through the 
liver, which gives a measurement of the liver stiffness. The vibration and 
measurement of liver stiffness is repeated a total of [ADDRESS_970942] been reported.  
6.Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan (MRI):  MRI scanning may cause anxiety in 
some patients since current equipment used at the Clinical Center uses a closed 
tube. Patients will be offered sedatives such as Valium if they express concern 
about being in a closed space. The MRI will be performed for clinical purposes 
will be used to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
7. Risk of Gadolinum: Gadolinum can cause an allergic reaction and nephrogenic 
systemic fibrosis (NSF). NSF causes fibrosis of the skin and connective tissues 
throughout the body. Patients develop skin thickening that may prevent bending 
and extending joints, resulting in decreased mobility of joints. Patients at risk are 
those with acute or chronic severe renal (kidney) insufficiency (glomerular 
filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73m2). The eGFR will have to be greater than >30 
ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_970943] will be 
performed. 
8. Risks related to clinical relevance: Standard clinical tests that are performed by 
[CONTACT_713336].  Clinical tests not performed at the NIH 
will be reviewed as part of the medical record review.  Other non-CLIA certified 
tests will not be included in the medical record or routinely discussed with the 
patient.  In view of the research nature of this protocol, the non-CLIA certified 
results can not be meaningfully interpreted outside of the narrow focus of this 
study.
9.Risks related to the use of questionnaires:  The quality of life questionnaires will 
be distributed to all subjects in this study.  These questionnaires will not be 
analyzed in real time but will be analyzed in batch form at a later date.  There are 
no risks to completing the questionnaires and we do not expect to uncover 
additional medical problems with these questionnaires that would not otherwise 
be evaluated during routine clinical visits during the course of participation in this 
study.  
10.The risks and hazards of lonafarnib therapy.   Lonafarnib is an orally bio-
available tricyclic farnesyl transferase inhibitor that has been shown to have anti-
tumor activity in various phase I and II trials and anti-HDV properties in various 
preclinical models and five recently completed phase [ADDRESS_970944] been completed with lonafarnib alone or in combination with a 
variety of chemotherapeutic regimens. This has amounted to the administration of 
lonafarnib to >7000 subjects.   Specifically, the administration of lonafarnib to 
patients with known liver disease and chronic HDV infection is >120 subjects, to 
date.
In initial animal studies, lonafarnib was well tolerated and had no major end-
organ toxicities at repeated doses of 15 mg/kg up to 6 months in rats and 10 
mg/kg up to 1 year in monkeys; these doses result in systemic exposures that are 
less than those attained at a clinical dose of 200 mg twice per day (BID).  At 
higher doses, representing animal to human exposure multiples similar to that 
seen in humans at [ADDRESS_970945] doses for reproductive effects on fertility (10 mg/kg in rats) and embryo-
fetal development (15 mg/kg in rats and <10 mg/kg in rabbits) result in systemic 
exposures less than those attained at a clinical dose of [ADDRESS_970946] dose for peri- and postnatal development in rats was >20 mg/kg, the highest 
dose evaluated.  Lonafarnib was not mutagenic or clastogenic.  
Metabolism studies conducted in vitro have shown that cytochrome P450 
enzymes, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, were mainly responsible for the oxidative 
metabolism of lonafarnib.  This metabolism was studied extensively in vivo and 
the principle metabolic pathways were similar in rats, monkeys and humans and 
primarily involved oxidation or dehydrogenation, and combinations of these two 
processes.  No metabolites specific to humans were detected in vitro or in vivo. 
The main route of excretion was fecal, with urinary excretion representing <2% of 
the administered dose.  Lonafarnib also causes mixed induction/inhibition of 
hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes in rats and monkeys when administered once 
daily for [ADDRESS_970947] shown that doses ranging 
from 25 mg to 200 mg twice daily (BID) are safe and well tolerated.  Doses of 
100, [ADDRESS_970948] been employed in various phase II studies 
involving solid tumors and hematologic malignancies47,48 In the initial dose-
finding phase 1 trial, minor hematologic and non-hematologic side effects were 
seen.48 The hematologic side effects included transient reversible neutropenia and 
transient reversible thrombocytopenia.  At doses of less than 200 mg twice daily, 
these grade 1 toxicities (NCI common toxicity criteria) were seen in 3 of 12 
patients.47 At the 200 mg twice-daily dose level, no toxicities were seen.  At 
higher doses, 300 mg BID and 400 mg BID, 2 of 6 individuals experienced grade 
4 dose limiting toxicities of neutropenia and 1 of 6 experienced grade 4 dose 
41
limiting toxicity of thrombocytopenia during a median treatment duration of 40 
days.47
The major non-hematologic side effects that were observed were gastrointestinal 
and consisted of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and anorexia which were mild and did 
not require intervention (grade 1 and 2) within the 200 mg twice daily group. 
Other toxicities that were observed included grade 1 or 2 elevation of liver 
enzymes; reversible grade 1 or 2 elevated plasma creatinine levels. At the higher 
doses of 300-400 mg twice daily, toxicities observed included; transient fever 
(grade 2), asymptomatic sinus bradycardia (55 beats/min) resolving at the end of 
therapy, reversible (grade 3) neurocortical toxicity consisting of disorientation and 
confusion. During the above-mentioned phase [ADDRESS_970949] replicated 
similar grade 1 and 2 side effects of; diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, 
anorexia, asthenia, fever/infection, hemorrhage, increase of serum creatinine, 
increased liver function tests and rash.49,[ADDRESS_970950] study, patients were treated 
for a median duration of 185 days. Currently, there are various phase I, II and III 
investigational studies ongoing ( www.clinicaltrials.gov) with no significant safety 
alerts (www.fda.gov). 
To date, lonafarnib has been administered to >120 subjects with chronic liver 
disease and chronic HDV infection at doses ranging from 50 mg once daily to 300 
mg twice daily.  In the NIDDK studies (proof-of-concept study (12-DK-0046) and 
the LOWR-3 (15-DK-0170)), patients underwent digitized electrocardiography 
(baseline, each study visit during therapy, and 1-2 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374]), 
ophthalmologic examinations with retinal photography (baseline, [ADDRESS_970951]-therapy) and 
evaluations for reproductive toxicity (specialist consultations, serological testing 
and transvaginal ultrasounds on day 3 of menstrual cycle for females (12-DK-
0046 only)).  No patients were found to have any significant changes in these 
parameters at any time during participation in these studies.  
In our proof-of-concept, lonafarnib was administered at doses of 100 mg BID and 
200 mg BID in a total of 12 patients.  During this study, patients underwent 
digitized electrocardiography (at baseline, weekly while on therapy and weeks 1 
and 2 after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374]), ophthalmologic examination with retinal 
photography (at baseline, end of therapy and [ADDRESS_970952]-therapy) and 
evaluations (specialist consultations, serologic testing and transvaginal 
ultrasounds on day 3 of menstrual cycle for females) for reproductive toxicity (at 
baseline, end of therapy and [ADDRESS_970953]-therapy). No patients were found to 
have any significant changes in these parameters at any time during participation 
in this study. Regarding symptoms encountered in this study, side effects of 
lonafarnib included mild nausea (25%), diarrhea (37.5%), anorexia (12.5%), and 
abdominal bloating (12.5%) in the lonafarnib 100mg bid group. In the lonafarnib 
200 mg BID group, nausea (75%), diarrhea (75%), anorexia (62.5%), dyspepsia 
42
(75%), vomiting (37.5%) and mean weight loss of 4kg (75%) were found. There 
were no grade [ADDRESS_970954] function not 
coded for by [CONTACT_713337], the risk of resistance development could be 
mitigated. As proof of absence of viral resistance with prenylation inhibitors in 
HDV, population-based sequencing of LDAg (codons 115-215) at baseline, end 
of therapy and 24 weeks after end of therapy was performed in our recently 
completed study (12-DK-0046).  Analysis at these time points revealed no 
changes in viral sequences thus confirming the absence of viral resistance. 
An additional risk that may be encountered with the therapy of HDV includes an 
increase in liver function tests during and after therapy, the risk of a flare in HBV 
(≥2 log increase and a total HBV DNA over 2,000 IU/mL) as the HDV viral load 
goes down, and an increase in HDV viral load after therapy is ended.  Flares in 
liver function tests are not uncommon with the start of treatment of HBV disease 
and necessitate a careful and frequent review of liver function tests.  We will treat 
all the patients with nucleoside analogues for HBV, the selection being made by 
[CONTACT_178447]’s condition and history of prior anti-HBV 
therapy. It should also be noted, that lonafarnib has undergone extensive analysis 
and has exhibited neither synergy nor antagonism in combination with the 5 
available HBV antiviral medications. A flare in HDV viral load after termination 
of lonafarnib will be monitored closely and interferon therapy may be started as 
determined by [CONTACT_093].  It should be noted that when interferon is used for 
HDV it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_713301] a year, and cessation of therapy may be associated 
with flares of HDV. 
11.The risks and hazards of Ritonavir therapy. Ritonavir is an orally bio-available 
protease inhibitor, which was used as a pharmacokinetic booster 
(coadministration of 100mg Ritonavir) of second protease inhibitor or other anti-
retroviral agents. In this study, ritonavir will be used as a pharmacokinetic booster 
of Lonafarnib. The most common side effects (>10%) of ritonavir are nausea, 
diarrhea, vomiting, altered sense of taste (taste perversion), abdominal pain, 
arthralgia, back pain, cough and loss of appetite. If it is used more than [ADDRESS_970955]/ALT can exceed [ADDRESS_970956] mild (Child- Pugh Class A) to moderate 
43
(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. There is no safety data 
available for severe (Child- Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment patients. 
Ritonavir is not recommended in patients who have severe hepatic 
impairment. As we are not going to enroll decompensated liver disease 
patients, it should not be a problem. 
b. Pancreatitis has been observed in those who developed 
hypertriglyceridemia. If clinical symptoms or laboratory abnormalities 
(increased serum amylase or lipase), pancreatitis should be considered. 
Patients should be evaluated and Ritonavir should be discontinued if a 
diagnosis of pancreatitis is made. 
c. Allergic reaction/Hypersensitivity including urticarial, mild skin eruptions, 
bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Cases of anaphylaxis, 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], Stevens-Johnson syndrome have also been 
reported. We will discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop.
d. Prolong PR interval in some patients. Post-marketing cases of second or 
third degree atrioventricular block have been reported in patients. The 
effect on PR interval of co-administrating with other drugs that prolong 
PR interval (calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, digoxin and 
atazanavir) has not been studied. But caution should be undertaken when 
co-administration of Ritonavir with these drugs, especially with those 
drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A.
e. Metabolism of Ritonavir is mainly through cytochrome P450 CYP3A4. 
21Concurrent usage of other moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers will lead to change in plasma concentration of concomitant 
medications, resulting prolonged therapeutic or adverse effects. Patients 
who are taking these medications should be excluded. 
12. The risks of the combination of Lonafarnib and Ritonavir. In the LOWR-2 study, 
the combination of lonafarnib (25 mg and 50 mg BID) and ritonavir, a total of 18 
patients were treated, with 7 patients reporting grade 1 adverse events (GI adverse 
events namely nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia and vomiting.) with 
lonafarnib [ADDRESS_970957]-treatment ALT flares with normal liver function. AEs were mostly grade 1-2 
intermittent diarrhea; 4 patients had grade 3 AE (2 diarrhea; 1 asthenia, 1 weight 
loss). There was 1 SAE (traumatic jaw fracture, unrelated to LNF). 
13. The risks of the combination of Lonafarnib, Ritonavir and HBV therapy. During 
the NIDDK study 12-DK-0046, 5 of 14 patients were on nucleos(t)ide analogues 
while on lonafarnib monotherapy.  During this 28-day study, there were no 
additional side effects that could be attributed to the use of a nucleos(t)ide 
analogue in combination with lonafarnib. Similarly, in the LOWR-2,3 and 4 
studies, nucleos(t)ide analogues were used in combination with lonafarnib and 
ritonavir with no adverse events pertinent to the combination noted.  Ritonavir has 
44
been used in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogues in HIV approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_713302]. Nucleos(t)ide analogues for hepatitis B function through 
a different mechanism of action and have different pharmacokinetics and side 
effect profile.  As such, it is believed that there is no added risk of the 
combination of lonafarnib, ritonavir and a nucleos(t)ide analogue for hepatitis B.    
14. The risks and hazards of lambda interferon therapy
Lambda has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies. A lower frequency 
of musculoskeletal (myalgia, arthralgia, and back pain) and flu-like symptoms 
(chills, pyrexia, and pain) was observed across Phase [ADDRESS_970958] generally been of low grade and self-limited. 
When study regimens included concomitant RBV administration, decreases in 
hemoglobin levels were observed as expected; however, anemia was less frequent 
and milder with Lambda/RBV than with alfa/RBV. Hematologic toxicity was also 
reported less frequently in groups treated with Lambda compared with alfa.
The main safety finding associated with Lambda treatment has been the higher 
frequency of transaminase elevations, accompanied, in some cases, by [CONTACT_713338] (direct) bilirubin, but without evidence for impaired liver 
synthetic function such as decreased albumin or increased INR. The 
hyperbilirubinemia cases resolved with no laboratory evidence of sustained 
hepatic dysfunction following dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug. 
In one study, 3 cases of concurrent ALT and TBILI elevations in patients with 
HCV treated with Lambda/RBV/asunaprevir (ASV) met program-defined criteria 
for pDILI; this led to discontinuation of this regimen in future development plans. 
Frequencies of concurrent ALT/AST and TBILI elevations across studies were as 
follows: 18.2% for Lambda/RBV/ASV, 3.6% for Lambda/RBV, 2.3% for alfa-
2a/RBV/ASV, and 3.5% for alfa-2a/RBV. 
In another study in patients with HBV, 4 subjects (5.0%) in the Lambda 180-g 
group and [ADDRESS_970959] (7.7%) in the 240 g group, and [ADDRESS_970960] (1.2%) in the alfa 
group met the laboratory criteria for pDILI. In 5 of the 6 cases, an alternative 
explanation (early, on-treatment, host-mediated ALT flare) was identified.
In vitro data did not suggest a hypothesis-driven metabolism- or transporter-
related rationale for the clinically observed differences in rates of 
hyperbilirubinemia between subjects treated with alfa-2a or Lambda, but 
retrospective analysis of safety data from the EMERGE study (Zwirtes 2016) 
found that hyperbilirubinemia events occurred within the first 12 weeks of 
treatment, and the temporal pattern of mean total bilirubin level in the Alfa/RBV 
group was similar to that observed in the Lambda 120 and 180 mg groups 
(although with lower quantitative values for Alfa), suggesting a similar 
underlying mechanism of hyperbilirubinemia, probably RBV-induced hemolysis, 
for Lambda and Alfa treatments during the first 4–[ADDRESS_970961] with baseline cirrhosis and 
Gilbert’s disease developed Grade [ADDRESS_970962] subsequently resumed therapy at a lower 
dose. In the Phase 3 study (AI452017) in GT-2, -3 HCV-infected subjects, 3 of 
approximately 70 randomized subjects with preexisting compensated cirrhosis 
developed decompensated cirrhosis while on treatment with Lambda. All 3 
subjects were Child- Pugh Class A at entry and had evidence of portal 
hypertension. Two of these subjects subsequently recovered; however, [ADDRESS_970963] 
died of infectious complications. Based on these data, Lambda appears to be 
associated with decompensation of cirrhosis especially in the context of portal 
hypertension. Enrollment of cirrhotic subjects in current studies is restricted to 
compensated cirrhotic subjects (Child-Pugh Class A) without evidence of portal 
hypertension.
In analyses of the cardiac effects of Lambda, no evidence of a clinically 
meaningful impact on QT/QTc interval or other key ECG parameters was 
detected in 32 healthy subjects given a single dose of Lambda 80 to 240 g or in 
176 patients with HBV treated with Lambda 180 g for 24 weeks. A slight 
increase in mean ΔQTcF was seen in the HBV patients. Lambda was not 
associated with AEs of ventricular arrhythmias or QT/QTc prolongation.
15.The risks of the combination of Lonafarnib, Ritonavir, Lambda Interferon 
and HBV therapy: The risk of combination therapy with lonafarnib, ritonavir 
and lambda interferon are not known Lonafarnib, in combination with ritonavir 
was administered along with alpha interferon to [ADDRESS_970964] been modified because the National Cancer Institute (NCI) designed the original 
version with use for cancer trials and not for clinical trials in liver disease.  The modified 
[ADDRESS_970965] and 
ALT values will be evaluated in the context of each individual’s baseline values.  Rather 
than utilizing specific cutoff values, which may not be in the best interest of each subject, 
if the investigator identifies a significant elevation in liver related laboratory tests which 
may jeopardize the patient’s safety, the drug may be discontinued. This is further defined 
below.  If the female becomes pregnant, the patient’s obstetrician will be provided with 
the standard of care guidelines to prevent HBV transmission. Medications will be stopped 
if pregnancy occurs, with the exception of HBV therapy, given the risk of hepatitis B 
flare during pregnancy.  Lonafarnib, ritonavir and lambda interferon will not be restarted 
unless another cause for the abnormality or symptom is found.

In addition to the above rules, all subjects who meet criteria for a treatment related 
liver event will undergo the following clinical work up:
Ultrasound of the liver should be performed, including doppler, for 
subjects with a bilirubin level greater than 1.5 times baseline 
If clinically feasible, a liver biopsy should be performed. 
o When a percutaneous biopsy is contraindicated, a 
transjugular biopsy may be discussed. 
Liver and chemistry labs should be performed weekly (minimally 
include ALT, AST, bilirubin, INR, alkaline phosphatase, albumin 
and gamma-GT) until the bilirubin returns to baseline value. 
HBV DNA and HDV RNA should be monitored weekly 
5 ml of serum plus 5 ml of plasma should be collected for possible 
later biomarker analysis

DEFINITION AND MANAGEMENT OF ON-TREATMENT ALT FLARES
On treatment flares will be managed per guidelines defined in Table 4. Post treatment 
ALT flares are defined as ALT ≥ grade [ADDRESS_970988]-treatment flares 
are defined as ALT  ≥ grade [ADDRESS_970989]-treatment flares may undergo an evaluation for other 
causes of liver disease, as well as may be initiated on Peg-interferon alpha per discretion 
of the study investigator.

and efficacy measurements.  Additionally, an outside data/safety monitor will be utilized.  
[CONTACT_713350], MD from the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the 
University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD will serve as the data/safety 
monitor and will review data every two weeks during the course of the study, or sooner 
based on clinical necessity. Yearly reports are made to the NIDDK/NIAMS IRB 
regarding safety and efficacy. 
DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN
Data will be maintained electronically on electronic case report forms (eCRF). Data 
reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress 
note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record. Clinical data 
(including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and 
clinical laboratory data will be entered into CRIS, which is 21CFR Part [ADDRESS_970991] include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study endpoints that 
are serious adverse events (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in accordance with 
the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study 
intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator 
must immediately report the event to the sponsor.
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until 
the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. 
The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as 
possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the 
[ADDRESS_970992] notify FDA and all participating investigators 
in an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from 
clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 
calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
The IND associated with this study (113137), in which the NIDDK is the sponsor, is 
associated with lonafarnib and lambda interferon.  The FDA has not requested an IND for 
the use of ritonavir in combination with lonafarnib. Study procedures will be subject to 
audits and/or monitoring visits to ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable 
regulatory requirements consistent with the NIDDK quality assurance program plan and 
applicable FDA guidelines.  Audit and/or monitoring visit results will be reported to the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_81734].   Study documents and 
pertinent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81735].
RECRUITMENT STRATEGY
We will advertise on the NIH web site and through letters sent to local physicians and 
clinics for patients.  
Recruitment of Women, Minority Individuals and Children.
Delta hepatitis is a rare disease in the general population.  The major risk factors are 
injection drug use and hemophilia.  It is rare to find the disease in childhood, the majority 
of children with delta hepatitis being immigrants from areas of the world where it is 
common (Eastern Europe, Amazon Basin).  In addition, hepatitis is often mild in 
children.  Finally, FTIs have not been adequately evaluated for safety and efficacy in 
children. We therefore do not plan to recruit children below the age of 18.
Women are less likely to have HDV, as one of the risk factors, hemophilia is a disease of 
males.  Notwithstanding this, every effort will be made to  find both women and 
members of minorities with HDV.  To increase the representation of both women and 
minority individuals in this trial, we plan to advertise widely. 
CONSENT PROCESS
Informed consent begins with the initial approach of an investigator to a potential subject 
(for example through a flyer or advertisement) and continues (a) until the completion of 
the research study, (b) until the individual completes study participation, (c) the subject 
withdraws him/herself from the study or (d) the subject is withdrawn from the study by 
[CONTACT_093]. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from the participant prior to any screening 
visits, study procedures or treatments. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_713305]. Sufficient time and opportunity will be given for discussion of the research as 
well as to answer any questions they may have, taking care to minimize or eliminate the 
perception of coercion or undue influence. The participant and the investigator will sign 
[ADDRESS_970993]'s permanent CC medical 
record. The consent process will additionally be documented in the electronic medical 
record (CRIS).
RESEARCH USE, STORAGE AND DISPOSITION OF HUMAN SUBJECT’S 
SAMPLES AND DATA.
Patients will have serum and stool stored from selected time points during this study.  
The serum specimens will be used for repeat virological testing and special tests as 
needed and the stool tests will be used for microbiome analysis.   Samples may be used to 
assess factors associated with response or non-response to therapy.    These samples will 
be tested in the Liver Diseases Branch or the routine clinical services of the Clinical 
Center.  Residual samples may be used for future research related to liver disease and its’ 
associated conditions.  If residual samples are evaluated by [CONTACT_713339], this will be done so only after all identifying data have been removed from all 
samples and all applicable tech transfer are initiated.   ARUP and The Doctors 
Laboratory will perform all HDV RNA quantitative testing for this protocol. All samples 
sent to outside collaborators, ARUP and The Doctors Laboratory will be numbered and a 
key to the number system will be stored and backed up by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_226723].  Research records and data as well as sera will be stored indefinitely in our 
locked offices and freezers, the medical record department and the pathology department.  
These materials will be protected and tracked by [CONTACT_713340] a compulsive filing system in our locked offices and freezers.  
There will be redundant storage of clinical information in the medical record department 
and our offices. Computer files will be maintained on password-protected computers and 
servers.  Serum samples will be processed and stored by [CONTACT_713341].  These samples will be stored in locked freezers inside locked rooms.  Access to 
these samples will require written approval from the Liver Diseases Branch chief, and 
will be recorded by [CONTACT_713342].  This should minimize the risk of 
loss or destruction of information and specimens.  If that were to occur we would report it 
to the IRB.  We do not plan to destroy this personal medical information or research 
subject sera after completion of the study because it may be critically important for 
physicians (here or elsewhere) to have access to this information when caring for these 
patients in the future.  If requested, Eiger Biopharmaceuticals (who will be providing the 
Lonafarnib, Ritonavir and Lambda), will have access to the clinical data only after all 
personal identifiers have been removed.  They will also be included in all serious adverse 
event notifications.
Data Sharing: 
After obtaining consent for data sharing, de-identified data collected from  demographic, 
dietary, quality of life, and symptom questionnaires, biochemical testing of urine, serum, 
radiological and liver biopsy samples of study participants will be made available without 
cost to researchers and analysts through NIH/ NIDDK data repositories. Data will be 
submitted at the time of publication. Users must agree to the conditions of use governing 
access to the public release data, including limitation of research to investigations 
58
consistent with the participants’ consent, restrictions against attempting to identify study 
participants, destruction of the data after analyses are completed, reporting 
responsibilities, restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper 
acknowledgement of the data resource. 
Study Alternatives: 
Alternatives to the study may be offered at the NIH or at outside medical centers and are 
routine therapy with interferon for 12 months, being monitored on no therapy, or 
awaiting results of this or other studies of therapy of chronic delta hepatitis. Patients who 
choose to enroll in this clinical trial, if not previously treated, may delay therapy with 
interferon for up to 48 weeks.  For this reason, if a patient has advanced disease, the study 
investigators may choose to recommend treatment with interferon before enrollment 
(either by [CONTACT_713343] 91-DK-0214 or outside of the NIH).
REMUNERATION/COMPENSATION
No compensation is offered to study participants.

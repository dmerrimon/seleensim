1.  Background and Significance  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) remains a major public health crisis: Drug overdoses continue to contribute 
over 70,[ADDRESS_792291] role in this 
ongoing epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]1. Individuals with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) therefore continue to die each year despi[INVESTIGATOR_598939].  
Medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) reduces overdose mortality : MOUDs (i.e. buprenorphine and 
methadone) are gold -standard tr eatments for OUD because they will reduce overdose mortality by [CONTACT_598969] 70%2. Unfortunately, close to 50% will relapse and discontinue  treatment within 6 months3.  
Neurocognitive deficits play a critical role in relapse to illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] : Individuals w ith OUD have a 
strong attentional bias  towards drug -related cues over neutral cues. This process is automatic, fast, and 
operates largely outside of conscious awareness. With greater attention paid to these cues, subjective  
cravings  then emerge4. The resul ting cravings in turn enhances the attentional bias even further, creating a 
self-sustaining cycle that can lead to relapse. Furthermore, individuals with OUD demonstrate poor decision 
making , preferring smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed reward s5. Finally , individuals with OUD 
demonstrate heightened reactivity to stressors6.  Together, these neurocognitive deficits contribute to the 
risk of relapse. A problematic feature of these deficits is their persistence long after abstinence is achieved, 
highlighting the difficulty in sustaining recovery in the long -term. As such, these deficits are important 
targets to improve treatment outcomes of individuals being treated with MOUD.  
There are no evidence -based psychosocial or pharmacologic adjuncts to e xisting medications to 
improve outcomes : Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive -behavioral therapy and drug counseling 
teach individuals to manage cravings, and have robust empi[INVESTIGATOR_598940]. 
However, in numerous cl inical trials, these psychosocial treatments have been largely ineffective for those

Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792292] interventions for individuals 
with OUD currently engaged in medication treatment.  
CBD has emerged as a possible intervention : We will address this need by [CONTACT_14664] a study of CBD 
which has promise as an adjunctive treatment to MOUD. In humans, CBD administration has been shown 
to reduce attentional bias for tobacco -related cues in individuals with tobacco use disorder, as well as for 
cannabis -related cues among individuals who are regular cannabis smokers.  CBD also significantly reduced 
cue-induced cravings compared to placebo in those with OUD but not taking MOUD9,10. In both animal 
and human studies, CBD appears to target brain regions that mediate neural responses to drug -related cues, 
indicating the relevance of CBD in modulating the attentional and motivational saliency of drug -related 
cues, which contribute to the  risk for relapse11. In addition, CBD appears to attenuate the reactivity to 
stressors among individuals with social anxiety disorder. Stress -reactivity is another important driver of 
relapse risk among OUD patients. However, no human studies have been con ducted in individuals with 
OUD to examine the impact of CBD on neurocognitive deficits  including stress reactivity . Therefore, the 
critical question this study aims to answer is whether CBD can reduce cue - and stress -reactivity, reduce 
attentional bias to drug-related cues, and improve decision making in individuals with OUD .  
 
 
2. Specific Aims and Objectives  
 
To evaluate the impact of CBD on cue- and stress -reactivity, decision making, and attentional bias in 
individuals with OUD currently in treatment with  medications for OUD (MOUD).  
• Approach : In a double -blind, placebo -controlled, cross -over trial, reward -related neurocognitive 
processes will be assessed after administration  of CBD 600mg or placebo  
• Primary Outcome : The primary outcomes is cue-induced cravings (Opi[INVESTIGATOR_59813]) . 
• Secondary Outcomes:  The secondary outcomes are  impulsive decision making (Iowa Gambling Task , 
Monetary Choice Questionnaire), attentional bias (Visual Probe Task) , and physiologic and sub jective 
stress -reactivity.  
• Hypothesis : Individuals with OUD in MOUD treatment taking CBD will demonstrate less cue -induced 
cravings,  stress -reactivity,  poor decision making , delayed discounting, attentional bias and stress 
reactivity than those receiving placebo

Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792295] Selection  
 
The proposed study is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, cross -over trial. The study will enroll 10 adult 
subjects with OUD currently receiving MOUD treatment with sublingual buprenorphine or methadone.  
Recruitment will occur from the outpatient programs that treat OUD patient at Brigham and  Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598941]’s Faulkner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598942], MA, and at the Rutland Regional 
Medical Center in Rutland , Vermont.  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
• Age 18 to 65  
• English speaking  
• Receiving either buprenorphine or methadone for treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_598943] 3 
consecutive months prior to enrollment  
• Agreeable to abstaining from using any cannabis or CBD products for the duration of the trial.  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
• Any self-reported use of cannabis or CBD products in the past 30 days  
• Current marijuana users  
• Baseline depression ( PHQ9 ) or anxiety ( GAD7 ) scores of greater than 10  
• Currently pregnant  
• Hepatic liver enzymes greater than 3x upper normal limit  
• Hypersensitivity to  cannabinoids , sesame oil (CBD solution comes in sesame oil emulsion) , or 
artificial strawberry flavoring.  
• Currently taking any medications with known significant pharmacokinetic interactions with CBD  
 
Subject recruitment  procedures : 
• We will use a variety of approaches to recruit for this study. We will use posted flyers at BWH 
clinical sites where OUD patients are being treated, and advertisements posted on Rally website . 
We will  also utilize the Patient Gateway messages sent directly  to active patients  by [CONTACT_598970]-approved letter for recruitment . Potential participants will be identified by [CONTACT_598971]:  February [ADDRESS_792296] and also with a diagnosis of an  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].  In addition, research staff will 
approach clinical staff during the staff meetings.  
• The RA will be largely responsible for identifying and recruiting potential participants.  
• Individuals will be recruited as soon as IRB approval is o btained and will continue until target 
sample size (n=10) is reached or when project period ends on December 31, 2022.  
• Individuals will be recruited from the [LOCATION_011] area, and patients being treated for OUD at BWH 
affiliated clinical programs.  
• OUD is pres ent in about 3% of [LOCATION_005] residents, and we have over 500 active OUD 
patients across BWH affiliated clinical programs with OUD and therefore should be able to reach 
recruitment target.  
• At our clinical sites, Black and Latino patients are over -represented, and therefore our study will 
likely recruit an ethnically and racially diverse participant population.  
 
 
5. Subject Enrollment  
 
Adults with a DSM -5 diagnosis of OUD and who are currently in treatment with buprenorphine or 
methadone will be recruited. Patients with OUD at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH)  and Brigham 
and Women’s Faulkner (BWF) will be referred to study staff by [CONTACT_598972]. Their health care providers, who will be known to the potential 
subject and will have first -hand knowledge of the patient’s medical history, will (1) first give approval for 
his/her p atient to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]/approached for research purposes, (2) initially introduce the study to the 
patient, and (3) obtain the patient’s permission, verbally during the course of providing medical care, to 
be contact[CONTACT_66696]. Subjects will also be recruited from the Partners Clinical Trials website, 
http://Rally.partners.org , as well as print advertisements and flyers posted at the clinics. Study visits will 
be conducted at the BWH Center for Clinical Investigatio n. Study staff will perform a preliminary screen 
on the telephone or virtually to establish suitability for the study. If suitable, a study staff will schedule 
the individual for a baseline visit  which will be performed remotely or  in-person.  Informed consent will 
be obtained at the baseline visit in -person or remotely, after which the full inclusion and exclusion criteria 
will be applied.  For remote consenting, s tudy staff will utilize  the Mass General Brigham REDCap 
eConsent.  Those who meet criteria will then be randomized to either CBD first or placebo first, and 
scheduled for the two study visits.  
 
 
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Overall approach : A total of 3 study visits are planned ( Table 1 ) The first visit is the baseline visit, and 
the other two are double -blind placebo -controlled medication visits, where either CBD or placebo will be 
administered.  Participants will be randomized using a random -number generator in a 1:[ADDRESS_792297] will then be scheduled for their study visits 2 and 3 during which they 
will receive CBD or placebo in random order  in double -blind fashion . Visits 2 and 3 will be  scheduled at

Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792298] 1 week apart to function as a washout. Baseline visit will take no longer than an hour, and the 
subsequent visits will take no more than 2 hours to complete.  
 
Visit 1: Baseline  
Participants will provide written informed consent, obtain ed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a nother  study physician. The 
blood and urine samples collected during the Baseline Visit will be used for inclusion/exclusion purposes. 
Specifically, participants who are currently pregnant (as confirmed by [CONTACT_598973]), or have hepa tic 
liver enzymes greater than three times the upper normal limit (as confirmed by [CONTACT_598974], or 
LFTs) will be excluded. Subjects will also complete baseline PHQ9, GAD7, BPI, TLFB, COWS, 
PANAS, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2570].  
 
Visit 2: CBD or placebo  
After arrival to the study site, the participant will receive either the CBD 600mg or placebo, immediately 
followed by [CONTACT_598975], blood pressure, PHQ9, GAD, BPI, TLFB, COWS, opi[INVESTIGATOR_598944], and urine sample for toxicology testing. Hear t rate and blood pressure will be monitored every 
30 minutes (vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure) following receipt of CBD or placebo. At [ADDRESS_792299], visual probe task, Iowa gambling task, monetary choice questionnaire (MCQ), and the 
mirror tracing persistence task (MTPT) .  Just prior to and after the MTPT task, subjects will provide 
salvia sample and complete the positive and negative aff ect scale (PANAS). An additional saliva sample 
will be collected 20 minutes after the MTPT task.  
 
Visit 3: CBD or placebo  
The same procedures for Visit [ADDRESS_792300] 1 week after visit 2. 
The order in which CBD or p lacebo is administered will be randomized.  
 
Cannabidiol:

Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792301] Identification  
Subjects will receive 600mg of oral CBD or matching placebo. Cannabidiol will be provided using 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] ™ oral solution 100mg/mL.  Drug will be procured by [CONTACT_598976] 
(IDS) pharmacy and the pharmacy at Rutland Regional 
Medical Center. The CBD or matching placebo will be 
placed in in oral syringes for the subjects to self -administer 
at the study site. CBD wi ll be stored at room temperature 
(68 to 77 F) in its original bottle and in an upright position. 
Once opened, CBD has a shelf life of 84 days.  
 
Primary Outcome : The primary outcomes is the change in 
cue-induced cravings (Opi[INVESTIGATOR_59813]).  
Secondary Ou tcomes:  The secondary outcomes are 
impulsive decision making (Iowa Gambling Task, Monetary 
Choice Questionnaire), attentional bias (Visual Probe Task), 
and physiologic and subjective stress -reactivity.  
 
Assessments : 
o Patient Health Questionnaire 9 -item (PHQ 9): 
Assessment of depressive symptoms  
o Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item (GAD7): 
Assessment of anxiety symptoms  
o Brief Pain Inventory  (BPI): Pain severity and 
interference assessment.  
o Time -line follow back  (TLFB): A method of 
assessing for  recent substance use  using a calendar . 
o Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9721]  (COWS): Assessment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351].  
o Opi[INVESTIGATOR_598945]12: A 3 -item tool to assess current cravings, cravings when exposed to triggers, 
and likelihood of using if placed in an e nvironment that the individual previous used opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
o Cue-induced craving13: Participants will be shown both illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related and neutral images on 
a computer screen for one minute each using a standardized protocol . The order in which the cues 
will be presented will be randomized and counter balanced. Participants will rate their cravings on 
a visual analog scale. The cue exposure procedure will end with a standardized debriefing 
exercise.   It is important to note that cue -exposure is a safe paradig m for studying craving in this 
population when employing debriefing procedures.  
o Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ)14: This is a 27 -item self -report tool used to measure 
delayed discounting, or the degree to which individuals prefer smaller immediate rewa rds 
compared to larger delayed rewards. Participant are asked to choose between a smaller (in dollars) 
immediate reward and a larger delayed reward.

Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792302] Identification  
o Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)15: This is a task to measure decision making, which utilizes four decks 
of cards (A, B, C, D). Participants are instructed to maximize profits by [CONTACT_598977]. Cards from decks A and B earn more profits but lead to even higher occasional losses leading 
to net long -term losses, while decks C and D yield low profits but only low occasional losses 
resulting in a net long -term profit.  
o Visual Probe Task16: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related and neutral images will be used. Each trial will begin with a 
fixation point lasting 500ms. A pair of images then will appear on the left and right of the screen 
for either a short (200ms) or long (500ms) stimulus duration to assess automatic orientating and 
controlled attention processing, respectively. Image pairs will be replaced by a probe in the location 
of either the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related or neutral image. Th e probe will remain until the participant responds 
to identify the probe orientation by [CONTACT_598978].  
o Mirror Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT)17,18: This task functions to elicit a stress response and 
measures distress t olerance. Participants are asked to trace a red dot along the lines of a geometric 
shape (e.g., star) using the computer’s mouse, but the mouse moves the red dot in the reverse 
direction. Each time the participant moves the mouse out of the lines or hesita tes for more than [ADDRESS_792303] Schedule (PANAS) : Subjective stress reactivity  will be measured 
using the Negative Affect subscale of the PANAS, a routinely used measure of both positive and 
negative emotions. This will be administered before and after s tress induction with MTPT.  
o Salivary cortisol : Hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) -axis response will be measured by 
[CONTACT_598979], immediately after, and 20 -minutes after 
the stressor task.  
 
Compensation : Participants will be reimbursed for travel/parking. In addition, subjects will be compensated  
$100 for completing the baseline visit , $50 for visit 2  and $100 for completing visit 3 ( $250 total for 
completing all visits).  We will utilize the Advarra payment systems to provide the study compensation.

study will be stopped prior to its co mpletion if: (1)  the intervention is associated with adverse effects that 
call into question the safety of the intervention; (2)  difficulty in study recruitment or retention will 
significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; (3)  any new  information becomes 
available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4)  other situations occur that might

7. Risks and Discomforts  
 
The well -being of th e study participants is of utmost importance. The in -depth screening procedure has 
been designed to ensure that individuals with any underlying medical or psychiatric illness are identified 
that may place them at greater risk for experiencing adverse effec ts during the study. The protocol raises 
several areas of concerns: confidentiality, emotional distress, adverse reactions to study procedures , 
suicidal ideation, and cannabidiol medication.  
 
Confidentiality : Confidentiality is of utmost importance given t he sensitive nature of the illness and data 
collected. During research there is always a possibility for a breach of confidentiality, which may 
potentially cause personal, social, occupational, legal, and other harm. Our research team is very aware of 
the importance of maintaining strict confidentiality and has prior experience dealing with sensitive 
information. The following precautions will be used to protect the privacy of participants and maintain 
confidentiality of research data: all staff will be tra ined in confidentiality and data security procedures; 
privacy will be maintained by [CONTACT_598981][INVESTIGATOR_207645], 
sound -proof rooms; data will be de -identified and coded with unique ID numbers; data will be securely  
stored in locked filing cabinets in locked rooms; electronic data will be stored in password protected 
documents located on password protected computers and secure servers; the key linking participants 
names and ID numbers will be stored in a separate pas sword protected document in a password protected 
computer; access to data storage areas will be restricted to authorized study personnel; and all analysis 
will be conducted on de -identified data. While breach of confidentiality is possible, these safeguard s will 
ensure that such a breach will be highly unlikely.  
 
Emotional distress : Some patients may experience discomfort or embarrassment related to providing 
urine samples or answering questions about substance use and other personal behaviors. They could also 
experience unexpected encounters with friends or associates while in the study. However, based on prior 
studies with this population, we expect the degree of distress to be very limited. All research personnel 
will be extensively trained on study proc edures, including the conduct of the interviews that elicit 
personal information, and the importance of being sensitive to and respectful of all participants. In cases 
where emotional distress does occur, research personnel will be trained on how to identi fy and address it, 
and when to terminate an interview. Multiple levels of back -up support for research personnel will be 
 
 
 
Research Consent Form  
General Consent Form Template  
Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792305] , and will be able to ensure that appropriate 
services are received.  
 
Advers e reactions to study procedures : The study  procedure s will end with a standardized relaxation 
and debriefing exercise.  Before participants are discharged from each study session, their well -being will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_207679] a standardized safet y and adverse events questionnaire will be used to 
assess any adverse events. If needed, participants will be referred for further clinical evaluation and 
assistance. It is important to note that cue -exposure and stress -exposure are safe paradigm s for stud ying 
this patient population when employing debriefing procedures.  
 
Suicidal ideation : Patients with OUD frequently have psychiatric co -morbidities, namely depression. 
Participants who disclose any suicidal ideation during the study (either through spontaneous expression of 
suicidal ideation, or self -reported on the PHQ -9) will result in e mergent evaluation by a licensed clinician 
member of the study staff for appropriate assessment and triage. Any disclosures will be handled within 
existing legal mandates, clinical practice, and social norms. Consistent with standard clinical practice, 
when possible, disclosures will be discussed with the participant to determine the best management 
options. This may include notifying the outpatient providers or family members, referring to medical 
treatment, calling emergency services, or escorting the par ticipant to the Emergency Room at Brigham 
and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. When required by [CONTACT_2371], the police department will be notified. The candidate is a 
board certified psychiatrist and has extensive experience managing acutely distressed patients with mental 
or substance use disorders.  
 
Cannabidiol medication safety : All subjects in this trial will receive a single dose of 600mg of 
cannabidiol. Cannabidiol (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) is approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the treatment of seizures associa ted with two rare and severe forms of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. However, cannabidiol is 
not approved by [CONTACT_598982][INVESTIGATOR_2427]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_377721] a previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_598948] 600mg administered to OUD patients for 3 consecutive days in a single -arm open -label design.  
That protocol was reviewed by [CONTACT_598983] d it me t the regulatory criteria for an exemption from the requirement for 
the Investigational New Drug (IND) submission, and we therefore received the FDA IND exemption 
letter November 13, 2019. This protocol uses the same medication (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]), at the same dose (600mg), 
for the same patient population (OUD on buprenorphine or methadone), and will administer for  only one 
dose instead of three consecutive days.  As such, we feel an additional FDA IND is not required to 
conduct this trial. Although this proposed clinical evaluation is for an “off -label” indication of 
cannabidiol, it does not involve a route of admi nistration or dosage level or use in a patient population or 
other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated 
with the use of the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] (cannabidiol). The proposed dose is within FDA -approved mg/kg maximum 
daily dose limits. There are now two randomized placebo -controlled studies of administering 400mg or 
800mg of cannabidiol to participants with opi[INVESTIGATOR_207647]. Nonetheless, 
cannabidiol may cause participants to exp erience side effects such as: somnolence; decreased appetite; 
diarrhea; transaminase elevations; fatigue, malaise, and asthenia; rash; insomnia, sleep disorder, and poor 
quality sleep; infections; and suicidal thoughts or actions. All participants will be told of these potential 
side effects, and the screening procedures, including liver function tests, are in place to minimize these

9. Statistical Analysis  
 
For all analyses, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data. All comparisons will utilize paired 
t-tests or non -parametric tests where appropriate. Alpha will be s et at 0.05 for all analyses.  
Primary outcome:   
• Cue-reactivity : Cue -reactivity will be defined as the difference between baseline craving scores 
and the craving scores in response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related or neutral cues.   
Secondary outcome:  
• Subjective cravings : Craving scores will be rated on a 0 to 10 visual analog scale  for each of the 3 
items.   
• Attentional bias : This is calculated as the difference in reaction time (RT) between when the probe 
replaced the neutral compared with the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related images (i.e. RTneutral – RTopi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]).  
• Delayed discounting : Based on their re sponses to the MCQ, the rate of discounting, or k value, is 
calculated, which range from 0.[ZIP_CODE] to 0.25. Higher values indicate greater discounting and 
impulsivity.  
• Impulsive decision making : A net score from the IGT is calculated by [CONTACT_598984] (i.e. (C+D) - (A+B)), 
where negative scores indicate decision -making that favors immediate rewards despi[INVESTIGATOR_598949].

Version Date:  February [ADDRESS_792307] Identification  
• Distress tolerance : This is measured as the leng th of time in number of seconds that participants 
engage in the third MTPT task.  
• Subjective stress reactivity : Subjective stress reactivity will be calculated as the difference in the 
negative affect score from PANAS before and after the stressor task.  
• Physiologic stress reactivity : Physiologic stress reactivity will be calculated as the difference in 
salivary cortisol levels and skin conductance before and after the stressor task.  
Power analysis : The estimated mean change in cue -induced cravings scores f rom prior studies is -1.5 (SD 1.5). 
Based on this estimate, and a conservative estimate of a correlation of r=0.60 between the two time points, a 
sample size of 10 is needed for 88% power and two -tailed alpha set at 0.[ADDRESS_792308]. A poin t 
estimate of the difference in the change and the 95% confidence interval will be reported. Conversely, if the 
change in cravings is not normally distributed, then a sum rank test will be used.

Common side effects:  
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• Decreased appetite  
• Diarrhea  
• Increase in liver enzymes  
• Feeling very tired and weak  
• Rash  
• Sleep problems  
• Infections  
 
Less common side effects:  
• Suicidal thoughts or actions (about 1 in 500)

and symptoms of liver problems during treatment with cannabidiol:  
• loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting; fever  
• feeling unwell, unusual tiredness  
• yellowing of the skin or the  whites of the eyes (jaundice)  
• itching  
• unusual darkening of the urine  
• right upper stomach area pain or discomfort  
 
Cannabidiol may cause you to feel sleepy, which may get better over time. Other medicines (e.g.  
clobazam) or alcohol may increase sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other 
dangerous activities until you know how cannabidiol affects you.  
 
Like other antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006], cannabidiol may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very  small number 
of people, about [ADDRESS_792324] any of these symptoms, especially 
if they are new, worse, or worry you:  
• thoughts about suicide or dying  
• attempt to commit suicide  
• new or worsening depression  
• new or worse ning anxiety  
• feeling agitated or restless  
• panic attacks  
• trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (insomnia)  
• new or worsening irritability  
• acting aggressive, being angry, or violent  
• acting on dangerous impulses  
• an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania)  
• other unusual cha nges in behavior or mood  
 
As with any drug, an allergic reaction can occur.  Allergic reactions can be mild or more serious, and can 
even result in death.  Common symptoms of an allergic reaction are rash, itching, skin problems, swelling 
of the face and t hroat, or trouble breathing.  If you think you are having an allergic reaction, call the study 
doctor right away.  If you are having trouble breathing, call 911 immediately.

breastfeeding infant, is unknown and may be harmful.  Because of these unknown risks, women 
cannot take part in this study if they are:  
• Pregnant  
• Trying to become pregnant  
• Breastfeedin g 
 
If you are a menopausal woman and have not had a menstrual period for the past [ADDRESS_792326].  Methods of surgical sterilization include having 
had a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries), a tubal 
ligation (having your tubes tied), and transvaginal occlusion (plugging the opening of t he tubes with a 
coil).  All other female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test before starting the study drug.  
 
If you are sexually active and able to become pregnant, you must agree to use one of the birth 
control methods listed below.  You must us e birth control for the entire study and for at least one 
(1) month after your last dose of study drug.  
 
Acceptable birth control methods for use in this study are:  
• hormonal methods, such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, injections, vaginal rings, or 
implants 
• barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide (a foam, 
cream, or gel that kills sperm)  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• abstinence (no sex)  
 
If you miss a period, or think you might be pregnant during the study, you must tell the stu dy 
doctor immediately.  If you become pregnant, you must stop taking the study drug and stop 
taking part in the study.   
 
Risks of Taking Cannabidiol  with Other Medications

effects that can happen when taking cannabidiol with other drugs.  
 
Risks of Blood Draws  
 
You may have a bruise (a black and blue mark) or pain where we take  the blood samples.  There is also a 
small risk of infection, lightheadedness, and/or fainting.  
 
 
Risks of Gathering Sensitive Information  
 
Some people may find answering questions about their emotional state and substance use or other 
personal behaviors upsetting. Although safeguards are put in place to protect your privacy, it is possible 
that a breach in confidentiality could occur. In that event, there is a risk of confidential sensitive 
information being accessible by [CONTACT_2312]. This could be emotionally  distressing.  
 
Risks Regarding the Psychological tests  
 
As described above, we will be using a computerized psychological tests  to see how cannabidiol affects 
your cravings, decision making, attention to drugs, and reaction to stressors. Some of these tests will

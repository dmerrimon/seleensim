1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Repurposing a histamine antagonist to benefit patients wit h pulmonary 
hypertension  (REHAB -PH) 
  
Study Description : Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one of many condition s that put 
stress and strain on the right side of the heart. This stress and strain can 
cause right heart failure. Although there are medications to treat PAH, 
there are curr ently no medications that act directly on the heart to 
improve right heart function. This is different than left heart failure  where 
one of the cornerstones of treatment is medication targeted at the heart 
to improve left heart function.  
 
Famotidine is a w ell-tolerated, over -the-counter, and inexpensive 
medication. Preliminary results suggest that famotidin e may help the right 
heart to adapt and strengthen when stressed instead of fail; however, 
these results are suggestive and not definitive. A randomized controlled 
trial is required to evaluate the possibility that famotidine can impact right 
heart function.  
 
Objectives:   
 Primary Objective :   
To determine whether famotidine increases six -minute walk 
distance at 24 weeks in men and women with pulmonary arterial

REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.[ADDRESS_890806]    Semi-annually  
As per clinical practice guidelines, patients will be seen every three  to six  months with blood work and 
six-minute walk testing. These elements (visit, laboratory  draw, comprehensive metabolic panel, 
complete blood count, BNP, pregnancy test, 6 minute -walk distance, and NYHA functional class) will be 
collected as  part of routine medical care and abstracted from the medical record as research endpoints. 
The pregnancy test can be performed as either a blood or urine test. A blood -based pregnancy test is 
preferred; however, if a urine test is used then it must be per formed by  [CONTACT_660496]. Echocardiograms are often part of routine medical care and will be 
abstracted from the medical record as research endpoints; however, the frequency may be influenced 
by [CONTACT_1758]. To avoid any concern about overlap, any echocardiogram occurring more frequently than 
annually will be considered research. It is anticipated that 1 of the 2 echocardiograms will fit this 
research definition. Other research elements include mass spectrometry for H 2 antagonists, the 
emPHasis -10 score, study procedures, and sub -study components.  
 
** These procedures will not be performed if the visit is done remotely.  
 
[ADDRESS_890807] that myocardial H2 receptors contribute to 
myocardial  fibrosis and are important mediators of heart failure. Our work has shown a l ower incidence 
of heart failure in community dwelling adults who use H2 receptor antagonists and a lower all -cause 
mortality in veterans with pulmonary hypertension who u se H2 re ceptor antagonists. A previous 
randomized controlled trial showed that famotidine improved b -natriuretic peptide, left ventricular 
morphology, and [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Functional Class in participants with Heart Failure and 
Reduced Ejection Fraction (left heart failure). H2 receptor antagonism is an appealing therapeutic ta rget 
that is well aligned with current NIH priorities of repurposing existing, inexpensive, and well -tolerated 
medications for novel use in other disease states.  
 
We will study intermediate range clinical efficacy o f famotidine in participants with pulmonary 
hypertension. We will also assess the safety of famotidine in participants with pulmonary hypertension.  
 
There are two sub -studies proposed for the REHAB -PH tr ial. One sub -study involves cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing and the other sub -study involves invasive hemodynamic evaluation using right heart 
catheterization. Understanding the relationship between therapy, exercise response, and invasive 
hemodynamic ass essment is important for all pulmonary arterial hypertensi on (PAH) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660475] -specific therapy. To date, nearly all therapeutic trials for 
participants with PAH have focused on medications intended to lower pulmonary vascular resistance 
and right heart afterload. Few studies have evaluated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660476] (<right heart ta rgeted therapy=). Targeting myocardial 
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.[ADDRESS_890808] small to moderate differences. The co -primary intent of these sub -studies is to begin to 
understand appropriate end -points in trials of right heart targeted therapy. This more exploratory 
motivation is intended  to complement but not supplant primary and secondary outcome measures 
including six -minute walk distance, BNP, and right ventricular struc ture and function by 
[CONTACT_660497]. Lessons learned from  resting, exercise, and invasive meas ures will 
be used to inform subsequent trials of right heart targeted therapy using famotidine and/or other 
compounds. We will study exercise response and invasive hemodynamic differences in participants with 
pulmonary hypertension with and without exposur e to famotidine.

improved mortality in a cohort of veterans with pulmonary hyperten sion. This raises the strong 
possibility that H 2 receptor antagonism is important in heart failure and likely alters the natural history 
of right heart failure.

this trial could  inform future trials that benefit t he larger community of patients with a range diseases 
complicated by [CONTACT_660498] (not related to PAH). Finally, results from the trial have the potential  
to benefit the health care system by [CONTACT_1541] a low cost adjunctive therapy for PAH patients, whose 
therapy currently represents a major expense for the health care system. These benefits may outweigh 
any risk associated with study procedures both for the study participant and the larger community.  
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINTS  
Primary    
To determine whether famotidine 
increases six -minute walk distance 
at 24 weeks in men and women 
with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.  
 The primary end -point is th e change 
in six-minute walk distance (6MWD)  
between baseline and  24 weeks.  This 
will be compared between treatment 
groups.  The six -minute walk 
distance  is simple, 
reproducible, and well 
tolerated in patients 
with PAH.  The 6MWD 
has been the primary 
outcome measure for 
the majority of pi[INVESTIGATOR_660477], treatment 
outcome, and surviva l. 
Secondary    
To determine whether famotidine 
reduces BNP at 24 we eks 
 
To determine whether famotidine 
improves [LOCATION_001] Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class 
at [ADDRESS_890812]

additional pulmonary vasodilator)  
 
Tertia ry/Exploratory    
Exercise sub -study:  
 
To determine whether famotidine 
increases maximal oxygen uptake 
in individuals with pulmonary 
arterial hypertension at 24 weeks  
 
To explore changes in other metrics 
of the exercise response (oxygen 
uptake, Ve/VCO2 ratio, total

relative to placebo over 24 weeks.  
 
 
Right heart catheterization sub-
study:  
 
To determine whether famotidine 
increases str oke volume index at 24 
weeks  
 
To explore whether famotidine is 
associated with differences in 
wedge pressure, right atrial 
pressure, and/or pulmonary 
vascular resistance at 24 weeks The primary analyses will be the 
change in oxygen consumption (VO2) 
for t he exercise sub -study and the 
change in stroke volume index (SVi) 
for the right heart catheterization 
sub-study conducted using the 
intent -to-treat (ITT) population.  
 
Qualitative descriptions of other 
exercise and hemodynamic markers 
including mean, media n, and 
distribution will be presented 
stratified by [CONTACT_1570] . While the two 
proposed sub -studies 
are powered to detect 
plausible, but large 
differences in exercise 
response or invasive 
hemodynamic markers, 
these studies are not 
powered to detect 
small to moderate 
differences. The co -
primary intent of these 
sub-studies is to begin 
to understand 
appropriate end -points 
in trials of right heart 
targeted therapy. This 
more exploratory 
motivation is intended 
to complement but not 
supplant primary and 
secon dary outcome 
measures.  
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.[ADDRESS_890813] on functional outcomes (si x-minute walk distance  
and CPET ), patient -reported outcomes (emPHasis -10 questionnaire , Appendix 1 ), and metrics of right 
heart stress and  strain (echocardiography, BNP, and invasive hemodynamics). Right heart failure is the 
key driver of morbidity and mortality for patients with PAH. Treatm ents for pulmonary vascular disease 
have been developed over the last twenty years; however, there are  no cardiac -targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660478]. Our work and the work of others strongly suggests that H2 
receptor signaling is important in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure and antagonism of 
the H2 recept or may improve the natural history of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The 
potential importance of this approach is augmented by [CONTACT_660499] -
tolerated and inexpensive over -the-counter medication for gastro -esophageal reflux. Inexpensive and 
well-tolerated medications are important for all diseases; however, are particularly needed for patients 
with pulmonary vascular disease where current medicatio ns targeting the pulmonary vasculature are 
notable for their extreme  expense and high side effect profile.  
  
4.[ADDRESS_890814] on the health care  system. If we show efficacy, 
this represents a high value addition for patients and  society.  
 
The choice of 24 weeks was not arbitrary. A previous randomized controlled trial showed that 
famotidine relative to an active control (teprenone) improved b -natriuretic peptide, left ventricular 
morphology, and [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Functional Class over 24 weeks in participant s with Heart 
Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction (left heart failure). 
 
To avoid contamination of the placebo arm by [CONTACT_660500] -the-counter H2 receptor 
antagonists for acid reflux, we  will provide all participants with a comprehensive lis t of H2 receptor 
antagonists to avoid during the trial. We will also provide Calcium Carbonate and Omeprazole for acute 
and chronic control of acid reflux symptoms during the trial. This will help to m inimize inadvertent 
contamination of the control arm through self -treatment of acid reflux.

information is required to ensure transparent reporting of scree n failure participants, to meet the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to 
queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
 
5.[ADDRESS_890820]. Potentially eligible participants  will be recruited at the time of their clinic visit 
or if time permits, they will  receive a one page letter via mail describing the study  and/or a phone call 
from the study coordinator  in anticipation of their next visit to clinic. During the potential participan t9s 
clinic visit, they will be approached and invited to participate in the REHAB -PH study by [CONTACT_660502]. A research coordinator will follow -up with any patient 
who is willing or c onsidering participation in the study. This may include scheduling a baseline visit in -
person at the clinic visit and/or following up by [CONTACT_756].  
 
Retention is a vital consideration for the success of th e study. As we have done in other studies, we will 
maximize retention by [CONTACT_660503]. Staff conducting adherence and retention efforts will be trained to conduct effective 
informe d consent to assure that participants fully understand the demands and nature of the study 
before they enroll. Clinical center staff will carefully review study requirements with the subjects, 
explain the concept of random assignment and what each tr eatmen t involves, and stress the importance 
of follow -up assessment even if they are not adhering to their assigned treatment. Participants will be 
nominally remunerated for their participation to offset travel and parking costs. Clinic staff will, at each 
visit, convey our appreciation for their participation in the study.  Concerns about individual participants

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_890822] . Participants will receive either 20mg 
of famotidine or placebo. H2 receptor antagonists are widely available, over -the-counter medications 
and acid reflux (their current indication) is common. Over -dose with an H2 receptor antagonists has not 
been described; however, to avoid contamination of the placebo arm by [CONTACT_660500] -the-
counter H2 receptor antagonists for acid reflux, we will provide all participants with a comprehensive list 
of H2 receptor antagonists to avoid during the trial. We will also provide Calcium Carbonate and 
Omeprazole for acute and chronic control of acid reflux symptoms during the trial. This  will help to 
minimize inadvertent contamination of the control arm t hrough self -treatment of acid reflux. We will 
employ adherence and retention principles and procedures that  are standard in the cardiology trials unit 
at the University of Washington . In addition, the degree to which this approach is effective will be 
evaluated through a mass -spectrometry based assay for the presence of any H2 receptor antagonist in 
the blood of study participants at the end of the trial. Ideally H2 receptor  antagonists will be seen in 
100% of the assays in the active arm and 0% in the con trol arm. Significant deviation from this expected 
finding will be considered in the inference on results.  
 
The placebo contains an inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_660480], the placebo tablets 
will be  identical in size, shape, color, and appearance to the famotidine tab lets.  
 
Famotidine and matching placebo tablets will be in bottles containing [ADDRESS_890823] 12 weeks of the study.   
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
Participants will be randomized to either take a placebo or a 20 mg tablet of famotidine, per oral, once a 
day for 24 weeks.  
 
6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
6.2.1  ACQUISITION  AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Harborview Medical Center Investigational Drug Services (HMC IDS ) will distribute famotidine and 
placebo tablets for the University of Washington Medical Center Investigational Drug Services (UWM C 
IDS) to dispense. U WMC IDS will store  the famotidine  and placebo  and dispense the pi[INVESTIGATOR_660481] w ill then give them to the subjects. The subjects will self -administer the pi[INVESTIGATOR_660482] -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.8

Kirkland Signature [CONTACT_660529] 20 mg tablets. HMC IDS  will provide famotidine 20mg 
placebo capsules (Placebo) and over -encapsulation of famotidine 20  mg tablets (Famoti dine)  to the 
University of Washington Medical Center Investigation al Drug Services (UWMC IDS) . UWMC IDS will 
place the tablets in [ADDRESS_890824] STORAGE AND STABILITY  
 
The bottles of famotidine and matching placebo should be stored at controlled room temperature of 
15°C 3 30°C (59°F 3 86°F). Each bottle will have an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  
 
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
Subjects will be ran domly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms  using permuted block 
randomization : (1) placebo or (2) famotidine. Subject randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_18642]/WHO 
Functional Class (NYHA/WHO Functional Class II versus Class III/IV) to ensure balanced representation of 
this important marker of severity. A randomization code will be computer -generated by [CONTACT_660504] (CRO) Axio Research , LLC. Subjects meeting study entry criteria will be randomized 
via an interactive web response system (IWRS). The randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_660505] (who is not on the project team) or designee and maintained 
in a secure and limited -access location separate from the study investigator and members of  the project 
team. The study subject, investigative staff, the Sponsor, the Sponsor study team (includes contractors 
and vendors), excluding the unblinded study site pharmacist will be blinded to treatment assignments 
during the study.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE  
 
Study drug counts will be conducted at all study visits. Per protocol cohorts include 80% compli ance with 
the once daily intervention. A total of 91 tablets will be provided at each study visit. A count of unused 
medications at the 12 and  24-week follow -up visit will be logged in a drug accountability log and used to 
determine compliance with the intervention.  
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 
For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only  by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the Case Report Form (CRF ) are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications and supplements.  
 
Participants are prohibited to take H2 receptor antagonists during the trial.  
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.[ADDRESS_890825] any  new  medication s added  between the visits.  
 
According to p harmacokinetic analyses, single doses of famotidine 20mg raised intragastric pH to mean 
values of 5.0 (similar for when doses were given in the ev ening or after breakfast). There were no 
cumulative effects with repeated doses. However, there are many studi es that have shown 
tachyphylaxis with repeated doses of H2RAs occurring after approximately a week of therapy. Repeated 
doses of H2RAs are associated with decreased time of gastric pH maintained above 4.0.   
 
The impact on the availability of pulmonary vasodilators is as follows:  
 
" Sildenafil: no interaction  known ; delayed rate of absorption with high -fat meals but not antacids 
(time delay 1 hr, reduced maximum concentration by 29%)  
" Tadalafil: no significan t interaction  known ; antacids reduced rate s of absorption with  no change in 
overall exposure; no significant effects observed with the co -administration of nizatidine 300mg  
" Riociguat: no information available specifically with H2RAs; however, concurrent use with antacids 
is associated with up to 50% reduction in riociguat maximum serum conc entration and 25% 
reduction in exposure; recommended to separate the administration of antacids and riociguat by 
[CONTACT_2669] 1 hr; specific mechanisms for these interactio ns are unknown but riociguat solubility is pH -
dependent, and therefore, increases in gastric pH may be partially responsible  
" Bosentan: no interaction 
" Ambrisentan: no interaction  
" Macitentan: no interaction  
" Oral treprostinil: no interaction; bioavail ability is increased by [CONTACT_660506], high calorie meals by [CONTACT_8622] 
49% but not known to be impacted by [CONTACT_660507]  
" Selexipag: no interaction; time to peak concentration may be delayed with food but not known to 
be impacted by [CONTACT_660507].

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 EFFICACY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
At the baseline visit participants will be consented and in clusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed 
for e ligibility. Participants will then undergo a standardized clinical assessmen t with medical history, 
symptom assessment including NYHA functional class, vital signs  (includes height, blood pressure, heart 
rate, oxygen saturation), weight,  and physical exami nation. Demographics will be collected. A blood 
draw will include safety laboratories including comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, 
BNP, and pregnancy test (for pre -menopausal women) . The pregnancy test can be performed as either a 
blood o r urine test. A blood -based pregnancy test is preferred; however, if a urine test is used then it 
must be performed by  [CONTACT_660508] i n the medical record.  All participants will  have  
serum collected for mass -spectrometry  at the end of the  study  to evaluate for contamination of the 
study  design  by [CONTACT_660509] -the-counter H2 receptor antagonists. Serum, plasma, and blood

and emPHasis -10 measure of health- related quality of life. They will also complete a 6 minute walk 
distance (6MWD) at their baseline visit . Distance, BORG dyspnea scores, peak heart rate, oxygen 
saturation , and heart rate recovery at one minute  will be collected to characterize the walk.  
 
Participants who are not participating in the right heart cathete rization or exercise sub -studies will be 
randomized and  study drug will be dispensed at this visit. Participants will be  instructed to take one 
tablet daily (20 mg of famotidine or placebo)  the following day which will represent day zero and entry 
into the study . An antacid (Calcium Carbonate) and proton pump inhibitor (Omeprazole), both over -the-
counter medications, will be provided by a study physician to participants as needed for short and long 
term heartburn control in an effort to try and minimize contamination of the study question by 
[CONTACT_660510] H2  receptor antagonist use by [CONTACT_660511] -treat heartburn with over -the-
counter medications.  
 
Individuals who are participating in the right heart catheterization or exercise sub -studies will be 
randomized and study drug will be dispensed  at their last baseline study assessment. These participants 
will also be instructed to take one tablet daily (20 mg of famotidine or placebo) the day following 
randomization and dispensing of the study drug.  
 
Regardless of the participation in sub- studies , all baseline assessments need to be completed within 14 
days prior to the start of study drug (not inclusive of the date the first dose of study drug is taken). The 
day study drug is taken will be considered day 0.   
 
Week 4 phone call will be on day 28 ± 7. This visit will address study drug adherence and adverse events.  
 
Week 12 visit will occur at day 84 ± 7. This visit w ill include a standard clinical assessment with a 
symptom assessment including NYHA Functional Class, vital signs, weight, and physical examination. 
Participants will also have a [ADDRESS_890829] via FedEx overnight shippi[INVESTIGATOR_660485]. In person visits will be encouraged.  
 
Week 24 visit will occur at day 168 ± 7 and will inc lude all components included in the baseline visit:  a 
standard clinical assessment with a symptom assessment including NYHA Functional Class, vital signs, 
weight, and physical examination. Participants w ill also have a [ADDRESS_890830] is preferred; however, if a urine test is used then it must be performed by

Participants in the invasive hemodynamic and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) sub -studies will 
have the option to do both tests on the same day or separate days, but within the 3 days of the final 
visit.    
 
8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
 
Any unfa vorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laborato ry finding), symptom or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is 
considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.  
 
8.2.2  DEFINI TION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
 
Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
" Death  
" Life -threatening  
" Event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
" Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
8.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
AEs are graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  An experience that is transient, & requires no special treatmen t or intervention. The 
experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activiti es. This includes transient 
laboratory test alter ations.  
Moderate : An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatm ents. The experience 
impacts usual daily activities. Includes laboratory test alterations ind icating injury, but without 
long -term risk.  
Severe:  An experience that requires therapeutic intervention. The experience interrupts usual 
daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment it 
becomes an SAE.

[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
Expected AEs associated with famotidine include:  
Headaches  
 
Although expected AEs associated with right heart catheterization are uncommon, they include:  
Pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, redness, irritation, b ruising, or development of a small 
hematoma/bleeding, allergic reactions in rare instances (e.g. hives or difficulty breathing from l idocaine 
or catheters) , infection, damage to nearby [CONTACT_341050] (artery, vein, nerve, lung), hypertensive crisis,

of the normal visit structure by a participant or surrogate.  Events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
8.2.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.8 
 20 Jan 2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   21 Deaths and u nexpected, but definite, probable, or possibly -related SAEs are reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_660489] 48 hours through the use of an e- mail transmitted SAE report form copi[INVESTIGATOR_660490], 
executive secretary of the DSMB, an d DSMB Chair.  
 
In addition, all events that meet the definition of an una nticipated problem (in the PI9s opin ion) should 
be reported to the UW IRB within 10 days using the Zipline Online portal.  
 
An unanticipated problem is a problem or event that meets all of the following criteria:  
" Unexpected 3 The harm (or potential harm) is inconsistent with risk information previously 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) in terms of nature, severity, or 
frequency as well as the characteristics of the study population.  
" Related or probably related to participation in the resear ch; 
o Probably related: There is a reasonable probability (more likel y than not) that the 
incident, experience or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_660513] s involved in 
the research, or that it is associated with the use of any drug, biologic, or medical device 
that is part of the research.  
" Suggests that the research places (or did place) one or more subjects or others at a greater risk  
of harm than was prev iously known or recognized. This includes physical, psychological, 
economic, educational advancement, or social harm.  
Reports are required within 24 hours  for qualifying medical problems covered by [CONTACT_660514] (HSAP), a breach of confidentiality, or inappropriate use of protected 
health information.  
In addition, the IRB requires a report within 10 days fo r serious non- compliance, continuing non -
compliance (serious or non -serious), emergency deviation from IRB approved procedures to eliminate  
an apparent hazard to subjects or others, complaints that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051], 
audit notification from a federal agency, information that indicates a new potential risk (e.g. new 
publication), and all DSMB report s.  
 
Expected S(AE)s are not required to be reported to the UW IRB outside of continuing review.

withdrawn from the study. This is anticipated to occur  uncommonly if ever. The clear clinical 
recommendation in pulmonary arterial hypertension is dual -method contraception and the risk of death 
with pregnancy is p rohibitive. Unintended or intended pregnancy is a very rare event in the pulmonary 
vascular disease clinic.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): The primary endpoint is the difference in 6 -minute walk distanc e.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  The secondary endpoint is the difference between treatment groups in 
BNP, NYHA functional class, TAPSE, right ventricular basa l diameter, emPHasis- 10 score, and number of 
participants with an escalation of routine clini cal treatments for PAH for each visit . 
 
We hypothesize that famotidine use in individuals wi th PAH will improve 6 -minute walk distance over 24 
weeks relative to placebo.  
 
We further hypothesize that over 24 weeks famotidine  use in individuals with PAH will lower BNP, 
improve the NYHA functional class, increase the TAPSE, diminish the r ight ventricular basal diameter, 
improve the emPHasis -10 score, and minimize the need to e scalate routine treatment for PAH (diuretics 
and pulmonary vasodilators).  
  
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.[ADDRESS_890838] of the medications used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  
 
The field is appropriately shifting toward larger event driven trials; however, we did not feel  a larger 
event driven trial of famotidine was warranted at this jun cture. The current proposal is the first 
randomized evaluation of this drug and this pathway in individuals with right heart failure and/or PAH 
and a smaller Phase II trial was felt to be a  more appropriate next step.  
 
For the RHC sub -study, the initial sample size was set at [ADDRESS_890839] large differences.  
 
Size of difference  SV index (mL/m2)  Total sample size  n per group  power

As the study progressed, recruitment into this invasive ar m appeared to be more feasible and the 
sample size was increased to 20 participants.

REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.8 
 20 Jan 2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   24 9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
Intent -to-Treat Population: All subjects who are randomized will comprise the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population. The ITT population will be analyzed for the primary and secondary endpoint analyses and will 
comprise the safety population used for all safety analyses.  
Per Protocol Population: Subjects in the ITT population who se famotidine medication reconciliation 
suggest adherence to study drug for 80% or more of administered doses will be evaluated as the per 
protocol population. The per -protocol population will be used in the sensitivity analyses of the primary 
and secondary endpoints. A second per protocol population will include participants for whom H 2 
receptor antagonists are detected by [CONTACT_660515] H 2 
receptor antagonists are not detected.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Except where otherwise noted, all tests will be two -sided and statistical significance will be determined at 
the 0.05 level.  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The primary endpoint is the difference between treatment groups in the change of 6 -minute walk 
distance (6MWD) between baseline and [ADDRESS_890840] will be provided with associated 95% confidence interval (CI).  
 
Missing 6MWD at  [ADDRESS_890841], baseline right ventricular diameter, and baseline BNP. The 
multiple imputation wil l use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which assumes that the varia bles in 
the imputation model have a joint multivariate normal distribution (MVN). The number of imputations 
to be performed will be 100. One hundred is selected because it is not too large that it requires heavy 
computations and is not too small (such that the Monte Carlo error is still small enough at around 0.[ADDRESS_890842] deviation). The <proc mi= procedure in SAS will be used to impute the missing 
observations.  
 
Although every eff ort will be made to avoid missing data, a range of approaches to missing 6MWD will 
be considered as sensitivity analyses representing a range of conservative and anti -conservative biases 
to describe the range of possible differences.  
 
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint  
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will include:  
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.8 
 20 Jan 2023  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   25 " a linear regression model using a worst case scenario (WCS) method of imputation  
" a linear regression model of the 24 week 6MWD without imputation (complete case analysis)  
 (1) The worst case scenario method of imputation will impute zero for all missi ng 6MWD at week 24.     
 (2) The linear regression method will model the [ADDRESS_890843] estimates and 95% CIs will  be presented.  
 
Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint  
Additional analyses of the relative change in 6MWD will in clude the proportion of participants who 
achieve a minimally important change in 6MWD of 31.[ADDRESS_890844] the null hypothes is 
that there is no difference between the treatment groups, logistic regression adjusted for the NHYA 
functional class (stratification variable) will be used. The difference betw een treatment groups will be 
provided with associated 95% CI. Subjects missin g the 24 week 6MWD will not be counted as having 
achieved a minimally important change.  
 
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median and range) of BNP (untransformed and log -
transformed), NYHA functional class, right heart strain, TAPSE, right ventricular basal diameter, 
emPHasis -10 score, and number of participants with an escalation  of routine clinical treatments for PAH 
for each visit will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Change in these param eters (log -transformed value 
for BNP) will be evaluated between the treatment groups using linear reg ression adjusted for the value 
at baseline and NYHA functional class (stratification variable). The difference with 95% CIs will be  
reported.  
 
The BNP is expected to vary by [CONTACT_660516]. An additional sens itivity analysis will be 
performed with the difference of log -transformed BNP between baseline and week 24 as the outcome, 
with the predictor variables being baseline log -transformed BNP, treatme nt group, baseline NYHA 
functional class, and an interaction term between treatment group and base line NYHA functional class.  
 
Missing data in the secondary outcomes will be imputed in an analogous fashion to the primary 
outcome including sensitivity analy ses to define the range of uncertainty imposed by [CONTACT_11368] 
(worst case scenario and complete case analysis). The worst case scenario is di fferent by [CONTACT_72246]. BNP 
and right ventricular basal diameter will be set to the highest value in the observed pop ulation. TAPSE 
will be assumed to be zero, emPHasis -[ADDRESS_890845] escalated PAH specific care.  
 
 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
All reported (S)AEs will be co ded using MedDRA and grouped by [CONTACT_6764]. (S)AEs will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_660517]. Incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_660518], severity, and relationship to study drug. If an AE is reported more th an once for a given 
subject, the greatest severity and the worst -case relationship will be presented in tables. The number of 
SAEs and AEs will be summarized for each treatment group as follows: (i) The proportion of subjects 
with at least one (S)AE, (ii) The average number of (S)AEs per subject, and (iii) The rate of (S)AEs per 
REHAB -PH PROTOCOL  Version 1.[ADDRESS_890846] week of follow -up. Histograms showing the frequency of the number of (S)AEs in each treatment 
group will be included. Rates of (S)AEs by [CONTACT_447420] C lass (SOC) will be pre sented by [CONTACT_6490]. Poisson regression modeling will be used to derive ra te ratios and 95% CIs for each SOC. Rate 
ratios will be compared using a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_890847] for Poisson count data.  
 
Safety lab data at each study visit and changes fro m baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. In 
addition, clinical laboratory summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_20625]: (i) incidence of 
significant abnormalities by [CONTACT_765]; (ii) tables summarizing the frequencies of subjects below, wit hin, and 
above the normal reference ranges at baseline and end of study; and (iii) tables displaying baseline to 
end of study shifts in each laboratory value (shifts between  below, within or above normal range).  
 
Although drug discontinuation is anticipat ed to be infrequent, the proportion of subjects permanently 
discontinuing study drug will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. Drug discontinuation events will be 
categorized as: (1) Permanently discontinued study drug and (2) Permanently discontinued study dr ug 
and withdrew from study. The reason for permanent drug discontinuation will be summarized. The 
number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660491] . Poisson regression modeling will be

characteristics such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index, use of concomitant 
medications, and markers of pulmonary hypertension dis ease severity (e.g., right ventricular structure 
and function, BNP, 6-minute walk distance, [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) functional class). 
Continuous measures will be analyzed using t -tests and categorical variables will be analyzed using chi -
square, Fisher9s exact, or Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel tests.  
 
9.4.6  DSMB REVIEW OF ONGOING DATA   
 
Reports to the DSMB will focus on trial integrity (recruitm ent, protocol deviations/violations, 
completeness of follow -up and adherence) and safety. Comprehensive safety interim reports will be 
provided semi -annually to the DSMB. Comprehensive, safety repo rts will include detailed summaries of 
all SAEs, AEs, laboratory parameter listings, drug discontinuations and withdrawals as well as other 
pertinent safety data. The DSMB will recommend continuation or discontinuation of the study based on 
these interim r eviews. Because of the length, size, and scope of the proposed s tudy interim analyses for 
efficacy or futility will not be performed.

CONFIDENTIAL   27 10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1.1  INFO RMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT  AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given  to the 
participant  and written documentation of informed consent is r equired prior to administering study 
intervention .   
 
All participants will be given a list of H2 receptor antag onists to avoid during the trial.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual9s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual9s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the participant  will be asked to read and review the document.  A 
study team  member  will explain the research study to the participant  and answer any questions that 
may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  participant9s comprehension of 
the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and o f their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the wr itten consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing.  The participant s will be given adequate opportunity to consider all o ptions by [CONTACT_660519] a later time if they would like 
to participate. The participant  will sign the informed consent document prior to any p rocedures being 
done specifically for the study.  Participant s must be in formed that participation is voluntary and that 
they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent 
document will be given to the participant s for their records. The informed consent process will be 
conducted and  documented in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before 
the participan t undergoes any study -specific procedures.  Study -specific procedures (like right heart 
catheterization) may be scheduled but not performed before consent is obtained. Many of the study 
endpoints including the six -minute walk distance, BNP, NYHA functional class, and e chocardiogram are 
also part of routine clinical care. As such clinically obtained testing within the specified time window 
may be used as part of  the baseline research assessment. Because these tests are not <study -specific= it 
is not considered a violation if they are obtained before consent is ob tained. The rights and welfare of 
the participant s will be protected by [CONTACT_660520] q uality of their medical care will not 
be affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
 
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE

With the participant9s approval and as ap proved by [CONTACT_141238] ( IRBs ), de-
identified biological samples will be stored at the University of Washington  with the same goal as the 
sharing of data with the NIH data banks. A transcript wide analysis of RNA samples  may be performe d. 
These samples could be used for future studies on any topic related to pulmonary vascular disease or 
right heart failure . The NIH will be provided with a code -link that will allow linking the biological 
specimens with the phenotypic data from each participant, maintaining the blind ing of the identity of 
the participant.  
 
During the conduct of the study, an individual participant  can choose to withdraw consent to have 
biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with regard to 
biosample storage may  not be possible after the study is completed  and data has been submitted to the 
NIH data banks .  
 
When the study is  completed , access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the 
University of Washington.

     IRB Number: Pro00077402 Date Approved 9/18/[ADDRESS_1099125]  TITLE OF RESEARCH:  Single-arm, Phase II Study Evaluating the Clinical Impact of Navigation on Delays and Racial Disparities Starting Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Adults with Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer: The NDURE Study   SUMMARY                                                                                                                                         You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. Research studies are voluntary and include only people who choose to take part. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new patient navigation intervention can decrease delays starting radiation therapy after surgery for white and African-American head and neck cancer patients. Participation in this study involves meeting with study coordinator twice and meeting with a patient navigator at least three times over the course of approximately five months. All five visits will correspond with appointments you already have scheduled at MUSC. The patient navigator will help you identify and overcome any barriers that may prevent you from starting radiation on time, such as transportation, explaining the treatment process, coordinating appointments, and sharing of information with you and your team of doctors. There are no physical risks to you by [CONTACT_514746]. However, there is the possibility you may feel uncomfortable or upset talking about your cancer.  Although it is not known, there is the prospect that participating in this research study will directly benefit you. Specifically, it is possible that the intervention will decrease delays starting radiation therapy after head and neck cancer surgery, which in turn may decrease cancer recurrences and improve survival. It is also hoped that the information gained from the study will help improve care for patients with head and neck cancer.    A. PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH  Please read this consent form carefully and take your time making your decision. As your study doctor or study staff discusses this consent form with you, please ask him/her to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand. You are being asked to participate in this study because you are expected to have surgery and radiation for head and neck cancer. The study is sponsored by [CONTACT_514747]. The investigator in charge of this study is Evan Graboyes, MD. The study is being done at one site: the Medical University of South Carolina. Approximately 45 subjects will take part in this study.

B. PROCEDURES  If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen: 1. The researchers will check your medical records to gather information about your diagnosis and treatment.  2. You will meet with the study coordinator to fill out baseline questionnaires.  3. You will meet with a patient navigator at least three times over the course of three months (from surgical consultation to initiation of post-operative radiation therapy [PORT]). The navigator will work with you to identify and address barriers before they cause breakdowns in care from the time of surgery until PORT begins. These sessions will be audio-recorded to help ensure that the navigator thoroughly identifies and helps solve your barriers. 4. You will meet with the study coordinator to complete questionnaires about your experience after your last visit with the patient navigator, to help us improve the process for future patients.  C. DURATION  Participation in the study will consist of five visits, lasting [ADDRESS_1099126] the confidentiality of your private information.  E. MEDICAL RECORDS AND/OR CERTIFICATE OF CONFIDENTIALITY Information about your study participation will be in your medical record. If you are an MUSC patient you have an MUSC medical record.  Results of research tests or procedures could be included in your MUSC medical record, although the current study does not involve any such research tests or procedures. All information within your medical record can be viewed by [CONTACT_351775]. We will make every effort to keep confidential all research information in the medical record that identify you to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371].

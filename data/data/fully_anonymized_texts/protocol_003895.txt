Newtown, PA [ZIP_CODE]  
Study Phase:  Phase 2  
Study Sites:  Approximately 15 sites  
Indication:  Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease  
Rationale:  Therapeutic interventions aimed at counterbalancing the effect of vasopressin may be effective in delaying disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).  
Objectives:  The primary objectives of this study are:  
• To characterize the safety and tolerability of lixivaptan following multiple doses in ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function (chronic kidney disease CKD1 and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal functi on 
(CKD3).  
• To characterize the PK profile of lixivaptan and its major metabolites (WAY -
141624, WAY -138451, and WAY -138758) following multiple doses of 
lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with relatively preserved kidney function (CKD1 and CKD2) and moderately impaired renal function (CKD3). 
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To characterize the effect of lixivaptan on urine osmolality over a 24 -hour 
period following multiple doses of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects.  
• To characterize the time course of the hem odynamic effect of lixivaptan on 
urine output, total kidney volume, liver volume, circulating  vasopressin, and 
serum creatinine in ADPKD subjects. 
Subject Population:  The subjects will be m ale or female, between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive) at 
the time of Screening, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2 
(inclusive) at the time of Screening.   The subjects will have an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cohort 1  and 3 ), or eG FR ≥  30 to <  60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cohort 2  and 4 ), with eGFR calculated by [CONTACT_104748][INVESTIGATOR_10444] ( CKD -EPI) equation.   Subject s will have been  
diagnosed with ADPKD based on  modified Ravine criteria . 
Study Design:  This is a Phase 2, open -label, parallel -group, multiple dose study designed to 
evaluate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of multiple BID doses of 50 and 200 mg lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects with chronic kidney disease in stages CKD1, CKD2 or CKD3.

1.1 Background  
Lixivaptan (also known as VPA-985, BIIB030, and CL 347,985) is a potent, non-peptide 
selective antagonist for the vasopressin V [ADDRESS_574211] of increased free water 
excretion, thus decreasing urine osmolality (U osm), increasing urine flow and increasing 
serum osmolality (S osm) as well as restoring normal levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine 
3’,5’-monophosphate ( cAMP ).2   
The Sponsor ( Palladio Biosciences, Inc. ) is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_450503] (ADPKD).  Lixivaptan had previously 
been under development for the treatment of symptomatic hypervolemic and euvolemic 
hyponatremia associated with heart failure (HF)  and syndrome of inappropriate anti- diuretic 
hormone secretion (SIADH).   
Additional background information for l ixivaptan  can be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
1.2 Overview of ADPKD 
Definition  
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary kidney disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_450521], liver and other organs.  It results from loss -of-function mutations in either of 2 genes ( pkd1  and pkd2), 
encoding transmembrane polycystin proteins PC1 (polycystin 1) and PC2 (polycystin 2), respectively.  
In the kidney, loss-of-function mutations in pkd1 or pkd2 disrupt the normal differentiated phenotype of the renal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  The se mutations  lead to elevated intracellular 
levels of  cAMP, which in turn results in increased cellular division and apoptosis, a loss of 
mitotic polarity, a disruption of the normal differentiated cellular phenotype, cyst formation, and fluid secretion into renal cysts.
[ADDRESS_574212]; and liver cyst infections cause

(ALP) levels.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_450504], which in turn promotes cell proliferation and electrolyte secretion.
[ADDRESS_574213] tolvaptan (JYNARQUE®) was 
approved in the US to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_450505].  However, because of the risk of serious liver injury, Jynarque is only available through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).  
The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) granted a positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_450506] V
[ADDRESS_574214] tolv aptan ( JINARC®) in [ADDRESS_574215] rapi[INVESTIGATOR_450505].  The Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Hum an Use ( CHMP ) recommended additional monitoring of the 
risk of liver damage with tolvaptan.  Similar approvals were granted in Japan, Canada, and Australia/New Zealand.  The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) did not grant 
approval to tolvaptan for the treatment of ADPKD primarily due to concerns regarding liver safety.  
1.[ADDRESS_574216] of vasopressin and/or normalizing 
intracellular levels of cAMP may be effective in delaying disease progression in ADPKD.7  
This hypothesis was confirmed by [CONTACT_450522] (Brattleboro rats) .  When these rats were crossed with rats harboring a 
PKD mutation, their offspring did not develop cysts,
[ADDRESS_574217] in the drug class of vaptans.  In Europe, tolvaptan (JINARC®) is 
approved to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of ADPKD in 
adults with CKD stage 1 to 3 at initiation of treatment with evidence of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_198291].  Approval was granted based on the findings from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trial TEMPO 3:4, the largest placebo-controlled Phase 3 study ever conducted in ADPKD.  The trial 
randomized 1445 patients with ADPKD with a total kidney volume of ≥  750 mL and an 
estimated creatinine clearance of ≥  60 mL/min to tolvaptan or placebo.  Ove r a 3-year period, 
tolvaptan delayed the worsening of kidney function, a therapeutic effect that was 
subsequently found to have disease-modifying properties, and slowed the progression of 
kidney enlargement .
12,13  Importantly, the TEMPO 3:4 trial also demonstrated that, in patients 
receiving tolvaptan, there was a strong, inverse relationship between the magnitude of the 
aquaretic response, measured by [CONTACT_450523], and the loss of renal function 
during the study.14  Because complete vasopressin suppression is ensured if urinary 
osmolality is lowered to <  300 mOsm/kg, these findings strongly suggest that achieving 
urinary osmolality reduction below this target threshold can be considered a predictive biomarker of clinical efficacy of vasopressin antagonists for the treatment of ADPKD .
14 
More recently, the results of REPRISE, a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] P hase 3 study with tolvaptan for the 
treatment of ADPKD, were published.15  This trial randomized 1370 patients with later stage 
ADPKD, which was defined as having a baseline estimated eGFR of  < 65 mL/min for 
patients in the 18-55 age group or < 45 mL/min for patien ts in the 56-[ADDRESS_574218] that was comparable to the one seen in the TEMPO 3:4 study (35%; p < 0.0001).  Taken together, the results of these two studies demonstrate that the efficacy of vasopressin antagonism is maintained across multiple time periods and stages of disease.  
The evidence supporting the potential utility of lixivaptan for the treatme nt of ADPKD is 
provided by [CONTACT_450524], a pharmacodynamic biomarker of effective vasopressin antagonism that is correlated with efficacy in ADPKD , as discussed below.  
Lixivaptan ameliorates disease manifestations in the PCK rat model of PKD 
The PCK rat, an orthologous model of human polycystic kidney disease (PKD) caused by a 
splicing mutation in the pkhd1 gene, is one of the best-studied models in the field of PKD research because it is characteri zed by a phenotype that is highly reminiscent of human 
disease.
[ADDRESS_574219] of lixivaptan in the PCK rat can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB).  
Lixivaptan causes sustained suppression of urine osmolality to levels that are associated with therapeutic efficacy in ADPKD  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 18 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  The expectation about the efficacy of lixivaptan in ADKPD is supported by [CONTACT_450525] .  
Clinical studies conducted with lixivaptan in healthy subjects and various patient populations 
(patients with hypervol emic and euvolemic hyponatremia and patients with ESRD) 
demonstrated that treatment with lixivaptan readily suppressed urinary osmolality to levels below the target threshold of 300 mOsm/kg, irrespective of the specific  patient population 
tested .  Importantly, the magnitude of the effect observed with lixivaptan wa s comparable to 
the effect observed with tolvaptan in the same patient populations.  In addition, like 
tolvaptan, treatment with lixivaptan was associated with  a rapid -onset and fully reversible 
increase in serum creatinine. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with 
lixivaptan can inhibit vasopressin receptor signaling to the extent necessary to observe 
clinical efficacy of a vasopressin antagoni st for the treatment of ADPKD.
[ADDRESS_574220] of lixivaptan on urine osmolality can be 
found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). 
1.[ADDRESS_574221]. Compared with conventional diuretics, lixivaptan increased urinary volume output about 3 to 4 times more than furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide at comparable doses and decreased urinary osmolality.  Four identified human metabolites of lixivaptan (WAY -
137930, WAY -138451, WAY -138758, and WAY -141624) were found to be weakly active or 
inactive as vasopressin V
[ADDRESS_574222] .  It 
was previously developed for treating disease states associated with water retention , e.g. 
euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia .  Pharmacokinetic ( PK), safety , tolerability and 
efficacy data for lixivaptan are available from 36 clinical studies, including 22 P hase 1 
studies in healthy and/or CKD subjects, [ADDRESS_574223] common adverse events (AE)  were headaches, dizziness, thirst, orthostatic hypotension, 
and t achycardia events .   
Additional information regarding the clinical evaluation of lixivaptan  can be found in the IB. 
Even though lixivaptan was never tested in ADPKD patients , proof of concept for the 
potential utility of lixivaptan for the treatment of ADPKD is provided by [CONTACT_450526] V [ADDRESS_574224] tolvaptan.  Results from the TEMPO 3:[ADDRESS_574225] development and renal 
insufficiency of ADPKD in adults with CKD stage 1 to 3.  The TEMPO 3:4 trial showed that 
tolvaptan slow ed the progression of kidney enlargement and delayed the worsening of kidney 
function.12  The study also established suppression of urine osmolality to <  300 mOsm/kg a s 
a predictive pharmacodynamic marker of clinical efficacy for a vasopressin V2 antagonist for 
the treatment of ADPKD.  More recently , the REPRISE P hase 3 study with tolvaptan 
demonstrated that the efficacy of vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonism is maintained in 
patients with later stage ADPKD.15   
1.7 Study Rationale  
This study is being conducted to directly characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK), safety, and 
pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of lixivaptan following administration of twice per day (BID) oral doses of 50 and  200 mg for 7 days in subjects with both autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 1 (CKD1), stage 2 (CKD2) or stage 3 (CKD3).  These proposed PK, safety, and PD assessments will be used to guide appropriate lixivaptan dosing recommendations for subjects wi th ADPKD and 
mild or moderate CKD.

ADPKD subjects with chronic kidney disease in stages CKD1, CKD2 or CKD3 .  The study 
will be conducted at multiple  Clinical Research Units ( CRUs ) in the [LOCATION_002] ( US). 
For all subjects , this study includes a Screening period of 42 days (Day -44 through Day -3), 
i.e. up to [ADDRESS_574229] up to 4 days  (up to 3 nights).  Subjects will be admitted  to the 
CRU in the afternoon of Day -[ADDRESS_574230] 3 days  (2 nights).  Subjects will return to the CRU to be 
admitted  in the afternoon of Day 6 and will be discharged from the CRU in the morning of 
Day 8.   Alternatively, s ubjects  may be offered the option to remain admitted to the CRU for 
the entire duration of the dosing period, i.e. from  the initial admission on  Day -2 (or Day -1 
where applicable) until discharge on Day 8.   
Except for the AM and PM doses on Days 1, 6, and 7, and the AM doses on Days 2, [ADDRESS_574231] 
self-administered doses in a Study Dosing Diary (Section 5.7.1).  
Enrolled subjects will be assigned according to CKD classification to take one of 2 dose 
regimens ( Table 5-1) for 7 days .  Each dose regimen includes morning (AM) and evening 
(PM) oral administration of lixivaptan .  Doses will be administered with ap proximately 10 
hours separation between the AM and PM doses as follows.  When subjects are confined to the CRU, the PM dose will be administered 10 ± 0.25 hours after the AM dose .  When 
lixivaptan is self -administered, t he PM dose will be administered  10 ± 1.[ADDRESS_574232] s will maintain adequate hydration throughout the study by [CONTACT_450529] a 
predetermined daily fluid intake regimen  (Section  5.9).  
To be enrolled, subjects must meet the following diagnostic criteria for ADPKD (modified Pei-Ravine criteria):  
• For subject s with fa mily histo ry of ADP KD, a minimum of  3 cys ts per kidney by 
[CONTACT_450530] y or 5 cy sts by [CONTACT_14781] ( CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging ( MRI); or 
• For subject s without fa mily histo ry of ADP KD, a minimum of  [ADDRESS_574233] a confirmed 
CKD Classification  of CKD1, CKD2 or CKD3 ( Table 3-1 and  see Appendix 1), and meet the 
other inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria (Section 4.1).

Study assessments including PK blood sampling, urine collection, PD blood sampling, 
physical examination findings , vital signs, ECGs , clinical laboratory tests, and  monitoring of 
AEs will be performed at the timepoints presented in  Table 12-1.  Adverse events and serious 
AEs (SAE)  that are related to stud y participation (e.g., protocol- mandated intervention) will 
be recorded from the time the subject  signs the Informed Consent For m (ICF) until the start 
of lixivaptan dosing.  All other AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the start of lixivaptan dosing until exit from the study .  Assessment windows are presented in  Table 12-2.  
3.1.1 Rationale of Study Design  
The I/E criteria in S ection  4.1 were chosen to recruit an adequate number of subjects 
representative of the ADP KD population to achieve the study’ s primary objectives as 
presented in S ection  2.1.1.   
Based on existing clinical evidence with lixivaptan and the related vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan, the PK and PD properties of lixivaptan are not expected to differ in ADPKD subjects with CKD1 and CKD2 stages, therefore these subjects with relatively preserved kidney function will be combined into one study group.  This approach decreases the total number of subjects that need to be recruited without compromising the study obj ectives.  
Conversely, subjects with moderately impaired renal function (CKD3 stage) may show distinct PK and PD responses to lixivaptan and will be enrolled into a separate group. 
The PK profile of lixivaptan and its metabolites will be monitored for 3-[ADDRESS_574237] dose of lixivaptan (Day 7 PM).   
Palladio Biosciences  PA-[ADDRESS_574238] tolvaptan,12 lixivaptan may be associated with transient and 
reversible decreases in Total Kidney V olume (TKV).  In order to characterize the time course 
and magnitude of these pharm acodynamic effects of lixivaptan in ADPKD subjects, the study 
design includes measurements of serum creatinine, plasma copeptin as a marker for circulating  vasopressin, and TKV at three time points: at baseline, after completion of the 
scheduled treatment period and [ADDRESS_574239]  SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA  
4.1 Selection of Study Population  
Approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 15 sites  (or more as necessary 
to recruit subject s) in the US .  Subject s will be assigned to study treatment only if they meet 
all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 
Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can 
potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of  the study, regulatory acceptability, or subject  
safety.  Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential . 
4.1.[ADDRESS_574240] meet the following 
inclusion cr iteria : 
1. Capable of understanding the written informed consent, provides signed and witnessed written informed consent, and agrees to comply with protocol requirements and study- related procedures.  
2. Male or female, between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive) at the time of Screening.  
3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m
2 (inclusive) at the time of 
Screening.  
4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cohort 1 and 3), 
or eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Cohort 2 and 4) , with eGFR calculated by [CONTACT_103062]- EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908] (Section 12.1). 
5. Subject  has been diagnosed with ADPKD by [CONTACT_450531]:  
• For subject s with family history o f ADPKD, a minimum of  [ADDRESS_574241] or MRI; or 
• For subject s without family history of ADPKD, a minimum of [ADDRESS_574242] count, medical records may be used in association with the Screening visit.  Alternatively, in the absence of sonography or radiography evidence from medical records , subjects may be included at the discretion of the Investigator 
until a modified Ravine diagnosis can be confirmed through the baseline MRI assessment (see section 6.1.6).   
6. Considered by [CONTACT_450532], based on medical evaluation that includes medic al and surgical history, as well as a complete physical examination 
including vital signs, ECG, and laboratory test results.  A single repeat assessment is permitted for any laboratory, ECG, or vital sign parameter required for enrollment. 
7. Female subjects must: 
• be non-pregnant and non- lactating; 
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 26 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  • be either postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for ≥  12 months and, if 
confirmation is necessary based on Investigator discretion, a confirmed follicle 
stimulating hormone [FSH] ≥  40 mIU/mL), surgically sterile (de fined as having 
undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy), practice total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred lifestyle (periodic abstinence is not acceptable), or agree to use an appropriate method of birth control consistently throughout the study and continue to use this method for 30 days after study drug administration.  
Double barrier methods of non-hormonal contraception are permitted in this study.  Acceptable forms of contraception include the following:  
 intrauterine devi ce, including Mirena
® 
 female condom with spermicide (cream, spray, gel, suppository, contraceptive sponge, or polymer film) 
 diaphragm with spermicide (with or without a condom) 
 cervical cap with spermicide (with or without a condom) 
 male sexual partner who  agrees to use a male condom in addition to female 
subject ’s use of spermicide (cream, spray, gel, suppository, contraceptive 
sponge, or polymer film) 
 male sexual partner who has been vasectomized for at least 3 months prior to Screening and who has obtained a follow-up negative sperm count 
 bilateral tubal ligation  
 Essure
® procedure  
Estrogen -based hormonal contraception is not permitted in this pharmacokinetic 
study due to the potential for interaction with lixivaptan.   
8. Male subjects who are sexually activ e with a partner of child- bearing potential must 
either be sterile (vasectomy with history of a negative sperm count following the procedure); practice total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred lifestyle (periodic abstinence is not acceptable); use a male condom with any sexual activity; or agree to use a birth control method considered to be appropriate by [CONTACT_737] (such as  hormonal contraception or one of the methods identified above for female 
subjects of childbearing potential) f rom the time of Screening until [ADDRESS_574243] agree not to donate sperm for a period of 90 days after study drug administration.

4.[ADDRESS_574250] as the date signed written informed consent is provided through the End of Study assessment , which will be on Day 35 or the 
date of Early Termination  (ET) for subject s who are withdrawn prior to the End of Study 
assessment . 
4.2.1 Reasons for Withdrawal /Discontinuation  
Subject s may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to 
their future medical care by [CONTACT_78760].  Every effort should be made 
to keep subject s in the study and, in the case of voluntary withdrawal, to inquire as to the 
reason(s) for withdrawal .  The reasons for subjects not completing the study will be recorded. 
If a subject withdraws for any reason after having received study drug, the subject will be asked to complete ET procedures, which will be the same as those scheduled to be performed prior to discharge from the CRU on Day 8.  If a subject voluntarily withdraws before receiving the study dr ug, no additional safety assessments or testing will be required. 
A subject  may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 
1. Does not meet the protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria. 
2. Noncompliance with the protocol. 
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 30 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  3. A serious or intolera ble AE that , in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], requires withdrawal 
from the study, including but not limited to  laboratory safety assessments that reveal 
clinically significant (CS) hematological or biochemical changes from the baseline 
values , other than changes that are expected for vasopressin antagonists, and 
symptoms or an intercurrent illness that justifies withdrawal.  M ild elevation s in serum 
creatinine or serum sodium are known pharmacodynamic effects of vasopressin antagonists like lixivaptan  and are transient and reversible.  Therefore, patients should 
not be withdrawn due to mildly elevated serum creatinine or serum sodium.  Cases 
where eGFR has declined by 25% or more from baseline should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
4. Lost to follow-up. 
5. Other (e .g., pregnancy, development of contraindications of use of study drug). 
6. The subject  withdraws consent, or the Investigator or Sponsor decide to discontinue 
the subject ’s participation in the study.  
7. The Investigator will also withdraw a subject if  the Sponsor t erminates the study . 
Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the Investigator will confer with the Sponsor.  If a subject  is discontinued because of an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved or 
stable as determined by [CONTACT_737] .  Any subject  may withdraw his or her consent at any 
time.  
Subject safety will be closely monitored throughout the study and the study will be conducted following GCP.  The entire study may be stopped at any time at the discretion of the Inves tigator in consultation with the Sponsor. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_574251]  withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal 
shall be recorded by [CONTACT_183093] 
(eCRF ).  Whenever possible, all subject s who discontinue study treatment or withdraw from 
the study prematurely will undergo all end-of- study assessments at  the time of ET .  Subject s 
who fail to return for final assessments will be contact[CONTACT_450534].  Methods for follow up will consist of [ADDRESS_574252]  for a reason rel ated to the study drug (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_18959]), then the subject  is considered discontinued from the study.  Discontinued 
subject s will be replaced if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034]. 
If a subject  does not complete the study for a reason that is unrelated to the study drug, the 
subject  may be replaced if the Sponsor instructs the site to do so.  The decision regarding the 
replacement of subject s will be documented.

5.2 Blinding and Randomization  
This is an open-label study and no blinding procedures will be used.  Following enrollment, 
subjects  will be centrally assigned to one of 4 cohorts depending on CKD status ( Table 5 -1) 
and based on a predetermined algorithm.  The [ADDRESS_574254] 2 males or females will be included in the 8 subjects (i.e., can be up to a 
25%/75% spl it of male/female or 75%/25% split of male/female)  assigned to each cohort. 
Similarly, at least [ADDRESS_574255] s assigned  to one of the 2 dose levels of lixivaptan ( Table 5-1) will receive oral 
lixivaptan BID (AM and PM) from Day 1 through Day 7.  The PM dose will be administered 
approximately 10 hours after the AM dose.

When subjects are confined at the CRU, each dose of study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_26359].  A hand and mouth check will be performed immedia tely 
after each study drug administration to verify that the study drug was swallowed.  The determination of plasma concentrations of lixivaptan  during the analytical phase will provide 
further confirmation of treatment compliance.  
Subjects will maintain a  diary of outpatient administration of lixivaptan  as described below.   
5.7.1 Study Dosing Diary 
Subjects will maintain a Study Dosing Diary for the duration of the outpatient treatment period (Day 2 to Day 6) and during the week immediately following the last dose of lixivaptan (PM dose on Day 7).  Subjects will be asked to record in the Study Dosing Diary each self -administered dose of lixivaptan , including date and time of dose and number of 
capsules taken, any subject -reported AEs and any other medications ta ken, including over-
the-counter medications.

This will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and OTC medications.  Any changes in prior or concomitant medications will also be recorded in the subject ’s eCRF.  
Any concomitant medication deemed necessary for the well -being of the subject during the 
study may be given at the discretion of the Investigator after consideration of the clinical situation and the potential for masking symptoms of a more significant underlying event (Section 5.8.1) .  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that details regarding

Upon entering the study, each subject will be instructed about the importance of not taking any medication (including OTC medications) without consulting the Investigator. 
5.8.1 Permitted  Therapy  
Allowed medications include those typi[INVESTIGATOR_450508], CKD and their complications, with th e exception of tolvaptan.  These include angiotensin II receptor 
blockers ( e.g., valsartan, candesartan, telmisartan, irbesartan)  and angiotensin -converting 
enzyme inhibitors (e.g., enalapril, lisinopril).   
Acetaminophen, at doses ≤ 1 g per day, is permitted for use any time during the study in 
subjects who usually take acetaminophen to control epi[INVESTIGATOR_75714].  Higher daily doses of acetaminophen may be allowed on a case- by-case basis upon the Investigator’s discretion 
and only in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  The use of acetaminophen at any dose is not permitted in subjects who cannot recall taking acetaminophen at least once in the prior 12 
months.   
Non-sedating antihistamines (other than loratadine) and decongestants may be permitted on 
an as -needed basis.  Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (up to 325 mg per day) is permitted.   
Chronic use of other concomitant medications that are required to treat a medical condition 
may be permitted, unless otherwise prohibited (Sections 4.1.2 and 5.8.2), on a case -by-case 
basis upon the Investigator’s discretion in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  All 
medications should be stable for [ADDRESS_574266] of care rather than on a stable dose.

21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  Lixivaptan has the potential to inhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrates, 
including atorvastatin , simvastatin, and amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. T herefore, care should be exercised 
when administering lixivaptan in combination with these substrates.   In order to minimize the 
potential for AEs due to drug- drug interactions,  prior to enrollment in the study, the 
Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, should consider potential dose adjustments or alternative therapeutic options that are not CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin to replace simvastatin or atorvastatin) or that have a high therapeutic index.  If subjects are receiving simvastatin as background medication  and it is not possible to 
replace simvastatin with rosuvastatin, the dose of simvastatin should be decreased to < 20 mg daily in subjects who are administered the 50 mg BID dose of lixivaptan and < [ADDRESS_574267] abstain from taking certain prescription and  non-prescription drugs 
or supplements during the period prior to Day  1, and until after the final assessment on 
Day 35.   
The following medications are strictly prohibited for all subjects within 30 days prior to study drug administration  on Day 1 (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) and until after the 
final assessments on Day 35: 
• Treatment with tolvaptan or conivaptan; 
• Treatment with any investigational drug or device;  
• Treatment with somatostatin analogs (e.g. lanreotide, pasireotide, octreotide, etc.);  
• Treatment with mTOR kinase inhibitors (e.g. everolimus, sirolimus, etc.) ;

The use of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 substrates is not prohibited, however care should be exercised when administering lixivaptan in combination with these substrates ( Section 5.8.1) 
due to the potential for drug- drug interactions.   
5.9 Diet, Fluid, and Activity Control  
During confinement at the CRU, subjects will receive standardized meals ( breakfast, lunch, 
dinner, and sna ck) at scheduled times that do not conflict with other study -related activities.  
Meals or snacks may be provided to subjects per the Investigator’s discretion.  Patients will 
be advised to maintain their normal diet upon discharge from the CRU. 
During Day s -[ADDRESS_574269] , and replenish fluids 
overnight with each epi[INVESTIGATOR_450509].  During CRU confinement, water consumption will be freely available to all subjects and dail y fluid intake will be recorded.  Fluid intake will 
not be recorded outside of the CRU.  The Investigator will assess ongoing fluid needs (e.g., by [CONTACT_450535], urine output, laboratory testing, etc.) as necessary in order to maintain adequate hydration of the subject throughout the study.  Special care must be taken if subjects are at an increased risk of water loss , e.g. in case of vomiting or diarrhea.  
Patients will refrain from c onsumption of grapefruit or Seville oranges (or their juices) from 
[ADDRESS_574270] dose of study medication until after the final PK assessment.  Consumption of caffeinated beverages (coffee, tea, sodas, etc.) will be permitted  during the 
study, however subjects must be advised to limit their consumption to two caffeinated drinks (12-16 fl. oz. each) per day.  Energy drinks with caffeine are prohibited. 
Patients will be advised not to consume alcohol from 72 hours before admission to the CRU on Day -1 or Day - 2, as the case may be, until discharge from the CRU on Day 8, and for 72 
hours before the final end of study assessment.  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 38 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  Subjects will refrain from strenuous exercise from 48 hours prior to Check- in (Day -1) and 
during the study through the final end of study assessment. 
Patients who are smokers will be allowed to smoke ≤  [ADDRESS_574271] . 
The study assessments to be performed at each visit and timepoint are specified in the study 
schedule of a ssessments (Table 12-1 ).  Assessment windows are presented in  Table 12-2.  
6.1 Safety and Tolerability Assessments 
The safety and tolerability of lixivaptan  will be assessed by [CONTACT_238798], physical 
examinations, vital sign measurements, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters ( hematology, 
clinical chemistry including liver function tests, and urinalysis), and the questionnaire for 
tolerability .  Additional safety assessments may be performed as needed at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  Safety assessments will be performed at scheduled intervals from Day  -2 
through the end of study assessment as presented in the study s chedule of a ssessments  
(Table 12-1 ).  Assessment windows are presented in  Table 12-2.  
6.1.1 Body Height, Weight, and BMI  
Body height (centimeters) and weigh t (kilograms) will be measured  to the nearest tenth , and 
BMI will be calculated (BMI  [kg/m2] = body weight [kg] / height2 [m2]).  Assessment 
windows are presented in Table 12-2.  
6.1.2 Physical Examinations and Medical History  
Complete  physical examinations will include, at a minimum, general appearance and 
assessment of the following systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, and throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], cardiovascular system, gastr ointestinal system, neurologic  system , blood and lymphatic 
systems, and the musculoskeletal system.  A licensed physician or qualified designee will 
conduct the examinations. 
Brief  physical examinations include, at a minimum, assessment of the following systems: 
skin, head, eyes , and throat, c hest and heart auscultation , abdominal examination, neurologic 
condition (i.e., alert and oriented x3; not including cranial nerves), and edema and hydration 
assessment.  A licensed physician or qualified designee will conduct the examinations. 
Physical examination s may be performed at various unscheduled time poi nts if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  Symptom- directed physical examinations will be performed as 
appropriate for subjects experiencing AEs.  
Medical history and demographic data, including initials , sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be 
recorded  at the timepoints  specified in the study schedule of assessments  (Table 12-1).  
6.1.3 Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will include systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and body temperature and will be performed at the timepoints specified 
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 40 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  in the study schedule of assessments  (Table 12-1 ).  Assessment windows are presented in 
Table 12-2.  
Subject s will remain at rest in a seated  position for a minimum of [ADDRESS_574272], before an ECG and/or blood draw. 
6.1.4 12-Lead Electrocardiograms 
Electrocardiogram  parameters of heart r ate, ventricular  rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT 
interval (uncorrected), and QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’ s 
formula ( QTcF ) will be performed at the timepoints specified  in the study schedule of 
assessments ( Table 12-1) .  Assessment windows are presented in Table 12-2. 
Electrocardiograms  will be obtained with the subject  remaining in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -
recumbent  position following [ADDRESS_574273] should be measured in the same position, i.e. either all in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_450510] a semi-recumbent position.  If other procedures are scheduled at the same timepoint, the ECG should be obtained after  vital sign  measurements and/or before the scheduled blood 
draw .   
For all subject s, ECGs will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_29517] a qualified 
designee.  The ECGs will be classified as being one of three categories:  normal, abnormal 
but not clinicall y significant (NCS ), or abnormal and CS.  All CS findings will be reported as 
AEs. 
6.1.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood and urine specimens will be collected for the clinical laboratory ( hematology, clinical 
chemistry, and  urinalysis ), pregnancy tests (all female subjects) and FSH tests (if necessary 
for postmenopausal female subjects) at the timepoints specified in the study schedule of assessments ( Table 12-1) .  A confirmatory assessment should be obtained as soon as possible 
for any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory parameter.   Mild elevation s in serum 
creatinine or serum sodium are know n pharmacodynamic effects of vasopressin antagonists 
like lixivaptan , therefore confirmatory assessment s for serum creatinine and serum sodium 
will be at the Investigator's discretion .   
Assessment windows are presented in Table 12 -2.  Clinical laboratory parameters for analysis 
are presented in Table 6-1.

6.1.6 MRI Assessment  
In order to investigate lixivaptan ’s pharmacodynamic effect on kidney and liver volume, 
patients will undergo a standardized abdominal MRI assessment without use of intravenous 
contrast for the determination of combined renal volume of both kidneys (total kidney volume or TKV) and liver volume (LV) at 3 timepoints as specified in  Table 12-1:  
1) at baseline (any time from Screening until CRU admis sion);   
2) immediately after completion of the 7 -day treatment period (Day 8 or 9); and  
3) at the final End of Study assessment  (Day 35 
± 2).   
Given the importance of performing the second MRI assessment within a short time interval after the last dose of study medication (PM dose on Day 7), it is recommended that all MRI assessments be scheduled for each subject at the time of the Screening visit.  Assessment 
windows are presented in Table 12-2.   
Occasionally, patients may be unable to continue into the study after completing their 
Screening visit and baseline MRI assessment (for example, due to changed personal circumstances or for not meet ing laboratory inclusion criteria ).  These patients may 
subsequently qualify for the study and be rescreened at a later time.  In this case, their prior baseline MRI assessment may be used instead of obtaining a new baseline MRI scan ; 
Palladio Biosciences  PA-[ADDRESS_574274] volume (total cyst volume of both 
kidneys) and combined renal parenchyma volume (total parenchyma volume of both kidneys) may be determined  for a subset of subjects at a later date. 
In the absence of sonography or radiography evidence at the time of the Screening visit, the baseline MRI assessment could be used to confirm a subject’ s diagnosis of ADPKD 
according to modified Ravine criteria.  
Subjects with ferro -magnetic prostheses, aneurysm clips, severe claustrophobia or other 
contraindications or exclusions interfering with MRI measurements will be excused from this 
procedure, but may participate in the study providing that all other eligibi lity criteria are met.  
Investigator should seek MRI safety guidance from local MRI facility.  
6.1.7 Urine Osmolality and Specific Gravity  
Spot urine collections will be obtained at the timepoints specified in the study schedule of assessments ( Table 12-1).  Subjects will be asked to completely empty their bladders [ADDRESS_574275] the time course of urine osmolality and specific gravity upon dosing.  Urine osmolality measurements will be per formed  at the central 
laboratory, whereas t he determination of urine specific gravity will be performed in the CRU 
in two manners: using dipsticks provided by [CONTACT_450536], 
where available.  
6.1.8 Questionnaire for Tolerability  
A questionnaire will be provided in the study reference manual that will assess how well patients tolerate aquaresis -associated events due to the planned lixivaptan  doses.  The 
questionnaire will be completed at 2 timepoints as specified in the study schedule of assessments ( Table 12-1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Collections  
Instructions regarding the collection,  processing, and shipment of laboratory samples is 
detailed in a separate laboratory  manual .  All samples will be given a unique ide ntifier.  The 
exact clock time of dosing, as well as actual sample collection date and time will be entered on the eCRF. 
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 43 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  Blood samples for the PK analysis of lixivaptan  will be collected at the timepoints specified 
in the study schedule of assessments  (Table 12-1 ).  Assessment windows are presented in 
Table 12-2. 
6.1.9 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance , as outlined 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] below. 
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled into this study 
regardless of its causal relationship to study drug. A treatment- emergent AE ( TEAE) is defined  as any event not present before exposure to 
study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after 
exposure to study drug. 
An SAE  is defined as any event that results in death, is immediately life threatening, requires  
in-subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical 
events  that may not result in death, be life threatening, or re quire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21684], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse 
Events  
AEs and SAEs that are related to stud y participation (e.g., protocol-mandated intervention) 
will be recorded from the time the subject  signs the ICF until the start of study treatment.  All 
other AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the start of study treatment until exit from the 
study.  Other changes in health or new symptoms occurring during the screening period will be recorded as medical history . 
At every study visit, subject s will be asked a standard nonlea ding question to elicit any 
medically related changes in their well -being .  They will also be asked if they have been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter  medications).  
In addition to subject  observations, A Es will be documented from any data collected that is 
deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., laboratory values, physical 
examination findings, vital signs, or ECG changes) or identified from review of other documents (e.g., subject  diaries) that are relevant to subject  safety.  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 44 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  [IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All A Es reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  
Information to be collected includes drug treatment, dose, event term, time of onset, 
Investigator-specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome.  Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported.  All A Es will be followed to adequate resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (e .g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those 
that worsen from b aseline, deemed  to be CS  in the medical and scien tific judgment of the 
Investigator are to be recorded as A Es or SAEs.  
However, any safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_216581]’s condition, are 
not to  be reported as A Es or SAEs.  
Any AE that meets SAE criteria (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) must be reported to the Medical Monitor 
and Sponsor (or designee) immediately (i.e. within 24 hours) after the time site personnel first learn about the event.  Investigators should record a ll SAE details available , including 
investigator causality assessment,  on an Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the 
EDC system  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  Notification of SAE entry will 
be generated and sent to Palladio Drug Safety and its designee by [CONTACT_27950]. In the event the EDC system is unavailable, a completed SAE Report Form should be submitted to IQVIA drug safety via email at [EMAIL_8638]  or via fax at [PHONE_1198]. 
If questions arise regarding SAE report submission, please contact [CONTACT_450537] 1 -[PHONE_7069].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
AEs should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death using the 
following definitions: 
• Mild (Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate (Grade 2): Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning. 
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 45 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  • Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt the participant ’s normal daily activities and 
generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually 
incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): Events that place the participant  at immediate risk of 
death or are disabling. 
• Death (Grade 5): Events that result in death.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  Adverse events characterized 
as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator ’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs.  The causality is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug itself caused or contributed to an AE. 
If the final determination of causality is unknown and the Investigator does not know 
whether the study drug caused the event, then the event will be handled as “possibly related 
to study drug ” for reporting purposes.  If the Investigator’ s causality is “unknown, but not 
related to study drug ”, this should be clearly documented on study records. 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study drug will be assessed and recorded on the eCRF.  Terms used to describe the degree of causality between a study 
drug/investigational product and an AE are: definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or not related.   The best estimate at the time of reporting of the causal relationship between the 
experimental intervention and an AE and the degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the criteria specified in Table 6 -2. 
Table 6-2 Guideline for Assessment of Adverse Event Causality  
Relationship to Study Drug  Description  
Not Related  The AE is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., underlying disease, 
environment) or exposure to the investigational product has not occurred .  
Such events MUST have an alternative, definitive etiology documented in 
the subject's medical record.  
Unlikely Related  A potential relationship between study drug and the AE could exist (i.e., 
the possibility cannot be excluded), but the AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_450538] (e .g., could readily have been produced by 
[CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or could have been due to environmental or other interventions).  
Possibly Related  The AE and administration of study drug are reasonably related in time and/or follow a known pattern of response, and the AE can be explained equally well by [CONTACT_450539] (e.g., could readily have been 
produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or could have been due to 
environmental or other interventions).  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 46 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  Probably Related  The AE and administration of study drug are reasonably related in time 
and/or follow a known pattern of response, and the AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_450540].  
Definitely Related The AE and administration of study drug are related in time, and a direct 
association can be demonstrated (e.g., disappears or decreases with reduction in dose or cessation of drug/inves tigational product and recurs 
with re -exposure).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Subject s Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page of the eCRF and followed to 
satisfactory resolution , until the Investigator deems the event to be chronic or not CS , or until 
the subject  is considered to be stable.  
6.[ADDRESS_574276] results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (e .g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, felt to be CS  in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
Investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
However, any safety assessments that are associated  with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by [CONTACT_216581]’s condition, are 
not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
6.[ADDRESS_574277] be reported within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence to the Medical Monitor and to IQVIA Lifecycle Safety on the 
paper pregnancy reporting form to [EMAIL_8638] .  
The pregnancy must be followed-up to determine outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and status of mother and child, even if the subject was discontinued from the study.  Pregnancy complications and terminations of pre gnancy will be reported as an SAE if SAE criteria are 
fulfilled.  Spontaneous miscarriages must be reported as an SAE. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the Investigator’ s attention 
after the subject has completed the study, and considered by [CONTACT_425852], must be promptly reported to the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor.

 Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using validated software and  using actual 
sampling times.  The calculation of PK summary statistics will be performed using  validated 
software .   
Calculation of accumulation r atios (Day 7/Day 1), metabolite to parent ratios for each 
metabolite, an  assessment of dose proportionality, or additional calculations may be made as 
appropriate to fully characterize available data.  Additional details regarding the PK 
parameter calculat ions are presented in the SAP. 
7.2 Pharmacodynamic  Parameters  
The PD analysis will include assessments of urin e osmolality and urine output , total kidney 
volume, liver volume, plasma  copeptin, and s erum creatinin e in ADPKD subjects (see Table 
12-1) .  Pharmacodynamic data will be listed and summarized as detailed in the SAP.  
7.3 Safety Variables  
The safety analysis will include c linical laboratory findings (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
and urinalysis), 12- lead ECGs,  vital signs , physical examination findings , assessments of 
AEs and the questionnaire of tolerability .  Safety data will be listed and summarized as 
detailed in the SAP.  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 49 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  7.4 Sample Size Calculations  
Calculations were performed assuming a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.30 and 0.41 for 
lixivaptan C max and AUC, respectively.  Assuming lognormal distribution, this implies that 
the variances for the logarithm of C max and AUC are 0.086 and 0.155, respectively.  Under 
these assumptions and a random sample of 8 observations, the probability is 0.90 that the point estimate of the population central value (observed geometric mean) for lixivaptan C
max 
and AUC will be within (84.3%, 118.6%) and (79.5%, 125.7%) of the population central value (the median), respectively.  
From the perspective of tolerability assessment for multiple dose regimens, for the true population incidence rates of 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50 for a given AE, the probabilities 
that the AE would not be observed in a group of 8 subjects administered l ixivaptan are given 
in Table 7-1.

21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  7.7 Statistical Analysis Methodology 
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® software Version 9.2 or higher .  All 
continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: number of 
non-missing observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: frequency counts and percentages.  All data will be listed in data listings.   Missing 
data will not be imputed but will be analyzed as missing . 
Further details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions are described i n the 
SAP.  The SAP may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this section may be p erformed if 
deemed appropriate in the plan. 
7.7.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The parameters describing the PK will be derived from plasma concentrations  of lixivaptan 
and its metabolites and actual sample draw times using noncompartmental analysis.  For 
summary of  plasma and urine concentrations, concentrations below the limit of quantification 
(BLQ) will be treated as zero for the calculation of all summary statistics except for the calculation of geometric mean and CV% of geometric mean, where they are treated as  
missing . 
Plasma concentration data for lixivaptan and its metabolites will also be displayed graphically on linear and semi- logarithmic scales.  The following plots will be presented for 
the concentration -time data: 
• Individual subject plasma concentration  profile versus time, stratified by [CONTACT_450541]. 
• Arithmetic -mean concentration (±SD) versus time, stratified by [CONTACT_210141]. 
Additional details regarding the PK parameter calculations are presented in the SAP. 
7.7.2 Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The change from baseline in urine osmolality, serum creatinine, plasma  copeptin, TKV and 
LV after multiple doses of lixivaptan  will be summarized by [CONTACT_210141] (CDK1/2 
and CDK3), and at each scheduled time point using des criptive statistics (n, mean, SD, 
median, m inimum, and m aximum).  
Except for the case of urine osmolality, t he baseline value is the last value observed prior to 
first administration of study drug and any values  after first administration of  study drug are 
regarded as post -baseline values .  The change -from -baseline variables  will be calculated as 
the post- baseline val ue minus the value at baseline. 
For urine osmolality assessments, t he baseline value for each time point after first 
administration of  study drug is the value observed at the corresponding time point on Day -1 
(or Day 1 for the AM predose assessment only).  A ny values  after first administration of  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-[ADDRESS_574284] -baseline val ue minus the value at baseline.  The number of subjects 
who show suppressed urine osmolality, defined as spot urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg for 
24h, on Day 1 (AM predose) compared with Day 8 (AM predos e) will be determined.   
7.7.3 Safety Analyses  
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
All laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_450542] (n, mean, SD, median, m inimum, and m aximum).  
The baseline value is the last value observed prior to first administration of study drug and any information taken after first administration of study drug is regarded as post baseline information.  The change -from -baseline variables  will be calculated as  the post -baseline 
value minus the value at baseline.   Change from baseline on continuous data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics at each scheduled time point by [CONTACT_210141].  For categorical data, change- from -baseline will be summarized using frequency and 
proportion at each scheduled timepoint by [CONTACT_210141]. 
Individual data listings of laboratory results will be presented for each subject .  Values 
outside of the laboratory's reference range (i. e., those with low or high val ues) wi ll be 
flagged in the laboratory listings.  
For all continuous laboratory variables, a shift table comparing the baseline value (normal, 
low, and high) to last observation on treatment will be presented. 
For urinalysis, a shift table comparing the bas eline value to the maximum value will be 
presented by [CONTACT_210141] (using number of subjects with results of negative, trace, or 
positive). 
ECGs  
A listing will be provided for Investigator- identified ECG abnormalities  from safety ECGs .  
Overall evaluation of safety ECG s will be summarized by [CONTACT_450543] s as normal or abnormal, and the relevance of the 
abnormality will be summarized by [CONTACT_450544] . 
In addition, a summary shift table comparing baseline interpretation (normal, abnormal - NCS, abnormal - CS) to the Investigator interpretation at each time point will also be presented.  
Continuous ECG parameters including heart rate, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, 
QT interval ( uncorrected), and QTcF interval will be summarized for renal function group 
and over each scheduled timepoint in terms of absolute values using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, m inimum, and m aximum).  
Palladio Biosciences  PA-102 Page 52 of 66 
 
21-Mar-2019  Confidenti al Information  Version 5  Vital Signs  
Changes from baseline in vital signs at each scheduled timepoint will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_450545] (n, mean, SD, 
median, m inimum, and m aximum).  The baseline value is defined as the last value observed 
prior to first administration of study drug.  The change from baseline is defined as the 
post- baseline value minus the baseline value.  There will not be any imputation for missing 
values.   All vital sign data will be listed individuall y by [CONTACT_450546] . 
Physical Examination s 
Changes in baseline in physical examination findings  (Normal, Abnormal -NCS,  
Abnormal- CS) will be summarized using counts and percentages for renal function group 
and will also be listed individually for each schedule d time point. 
Adverse Events  
An overall summary of the number and percentage of subject s in each category will be 
presented, as will an overall summary of the number of events in each category.  The number 
and percentage of subject s reporting AEs in each category above will be summarized by  [CONTACT_450547] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) assigned to the event using MedDRA. 
All AE data will be listed for all subject s.  Bo th the Investigator’s verbatim terms and the 
MedDRA preferred terms will be listed for each subject .  Listings will also include the SAEs , 
start and end time and date of AEs , relationship to study drug, severity, and action taken for 
the AEs.   A summary of  deaths ( for all deaths, AE outcome, not AE term, is death) will be 
provided by [CONTACT_450548] s by [CONTACT_210141].

Summary of Changes in the Conduct of the Study (from Section 9.8.[ADDRESS_574313] of the Study  
There were 2 protocol versions that were not implemented or submitted to the IRB. Protocol  
versions 1 and 2 were marked final and dated 19 March 2018 but the version number 1.0  
remained unchanged in the footer of both ve rsions. Refer to Note to File (dated 23 February  
2020) in Appendix 16.1.1 to distinguish between the 2 documents.  
Protocol version 3 (dated 24 April 2018) was the first protocol version submitted to the IRBs  and 
amended. There were [ADDRESS_574314] was enrolled. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_450513] 16.1.1. Brief summaries of the changes are outlined

Protocol version 4 (dated 09 January 2019) implemented the following changes:  
• Clinically relevant changes that affected the type or frequency of protocol procedures, or  
the addition of information to the protocol that influenced clinical decision making or  
consent:  
− Increased eligible age t o 65 years for inclusion in the study;  
− Provided flexibility in screening procedures;  
− Allowed the use of the low progesterone -releasing intrauterine device Mirena;  
− Limited hormonal contraception exclusion to estrogen -containing contraceptives.  
Progesterone -only contraceptives were allowed.  
− Allowed inclusion of subjects with elevated bilirubin due to Gilbert’s Syndrome  
at the discretion of the investigator.  
− Allowed inclusion of subjects with contraindications to or interference with MRI  
asses sments provided they met all other inclusion criteria. Clarified that no MRI  
tests would be conducted on these subjects.  
− Added exclusion of subjects who showed signs of liver toxicity on tolvaptan  
therapy.  
− Clarified batch number of investigational prod uct. 
− Clarified fluid intake recommendations before the first dose of study drug and  
while taking study drug.  
− Allowed supi[INVESTIGATOR_450514].  
− Clarified nature o f pregnancy test at EOS visit.  
− Added Day 11 to the Assessment Window table.  
− Clarified the appropriate time window for time values that were on the extremes  
of each time interval.  
• Clarified text which included corrections of typos, text changes for co nsistency or other  
clarifications which did not affect clinical decision making or consent. These included  
deletion of mesylate, the counter -ion of fenoldopam from the exclusion criteria.  
• Administrative changes, including changes of names or roles of com panies or personnel  
and/or contact [CONTACT_3031]. These changes did not affect clinical decision making or  
consent.  
 
Protocol version 5 (dated 21 March 2019) implemented the following changes:  
• Clinically relevant changes that affected the type or frequency of protocol procedures, or  
the addition of information to the protocol that influenced clinical decision making or  
consent:  
− Extended screening duration from 4 weeks to 6 weeks.  
− Increased study duration by [CONTACT_1121] 14 days to Screening.  
− Updated information on the status of the vasopressin V [ADDRESS_574315]  
tolvaptan (JYNARQUE®) in the US.  
− Provided flexibility to stop enrollment of CKD1 subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3 if  
sufficient experience with CKD2 subjects had not occurred.  
− Provided the use of a home nursing service to draw blood if repeat lab tests were  
needed during Screening.  
− Deleted amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_450515] a  
CYP3A4 substrate and not an inhibitor.  
− As inhibition of CYP3A4 by [CONTACT_450553][INVESTIGATOR_050], a  
dosing limit was added.  
− Increased the allowable upper limit of liver function test (LFT) results at  
Screening to 1.5 × ULN based on th e observation in the first 8 subjects treated  
with lixivaptan at 200 mg BID (highest dose) in this study that no significant LFT  
abnormalities had been detected. The highest values were 1.2 × ULN for  
transaminases with no increase in total bilirubin.  
− Clarified that if a subject did not come back for visits after Day 8, it was not a  
protocol deviation if the blood was drawn only by [CONTACT_241218] -home nursing service.  
• Clarified text which included corrections of typos, text changes for consistency or other  
clarifications. These changes did not affect clinical decision making or consent.  
• Administrative changes, including changes of names or roles of companies or personnel  
and/or contact [CONTACT_3031]. These changes did not affect clinical decision making or

adjustments or alternative therapeutic 
options that are not CYP 3A4 or 
CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin to replace simvastatin or atorvastatin) or 
that have a high therapeutic index.  If 
subjects are receiving simvastatin as 
background medication and it is not 
possible to replace simvastatin with 
rosuvastatin, the dose of simvastatin 
should be decreased to < 20 mg daily in 
subjects who are administered the 50 
mg BID dose of lixivaptan and < 10 mg 
daily in subjects who are administered 
the 200 mg BID dose of lixivaptan.  If 
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_450518], the dose should not exceed 5 
mg daily.

40 6.1.6 – MRI 
Assessment  Occasionally, patients may be 
unable to continue into the 
study after completing their  
Screening visit and  baseline MRI 
assessment (for example, due to personal circumstances or for 
not meeting laboratory inclusion 
criteria).  These patients may 
subsequently qualify for the 
study and be rescreened at a 
later time.  In this case, their 
prior baseline MRI assessment 
may be used instead of 
obtaining a new baseline MRI 
scan; provided, however, that no 
more than [ADDRESS_574331] be 
admitted into the CRU within 8 weeks from the original MRI 
assessment date for such MRI to be considered valid.

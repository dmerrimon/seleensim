 Page 2 1. Background/Preliminary Studies 
Nephrotoxic medication (NTMx) exposure is one of the most commonly cited causes of acute 
kidney injury (AKI) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65304]1, and is the primary cause of AKI in 16% of cases.  
Recent data from [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336408] 80% of non-critically ill children receive at least one NTMx (e.g., aminoglycosides, non-steroidal anti -inflammatory agents) 
during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
2. NTMx -AKI is associated with increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336409]; we found patients with NTMx -AKI secondary to intravenous 
aminoglycoside exposure spent a median of five additional days in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (additional cost of $17,000) compared to children who were exposed but did not have AKI
3.  Furthermore, 10-49% 
of adults and children who survive an AKI epi[INVESTIGATOR_336410]4-7, which puts 
them at risk for hypertension and progression to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or a kidney 
transplant.  
Through our initial work at Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center, we have found that NTMx 
exposure is potentially modifiable and the associated AKI is an avoidable adverse safety 
event.  In our single center systematic screening system to identify children at-risk for AKI 
called Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by [CONTACT_336417] (NINJA), we utilized an electronic health record trigger to improve near real -time clinical decision support collaboration between 
rounding physicians, pharmacists, nurses and patient families
8. With this systematic screening, 
we found our baseline NTMx -AKI rates (2.96 per 1000 patient-days)[ADDRESS_415631] infection10 rates,  
suggesting that NTMx -AKI is as important as these US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336411]. We recently published the 3½ year NINJA experience, demonstrating sustained decreases in NTMx exposures (38% reduction) and NTMx -AKI (68% reduction).
[ADDRESS_415632], we already observed a 30% reduction in NTMx -AKI rates. Four additional 
pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336412].  
In 
aggregate, the Collaborative centers observe a monthly average of 200 patients with NTMx 
exposure leading to 35 NTMx -AKI epi[INVESTIGATOR_7304] 20,000 patient-days screened.  In September 
2016, NINJA was accepted as the next Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336413] (HAC) for the Solutions for 
Patient Safety (SPS); the SPS is a national harm reduction network of more than [ADDRESS_415633] demonstrate 
that urine NGAL will not miss cases of serum creatinine based AKI (express a high sensitivity 
and a very low negative predictive value). If successful, we believe we can alter the approach to 
screening for NTMx -AKI as shown in the figure below. 
Our central hypothesis is that daily urine 
NGAL can replace daily serum creatinine measurements in children who meet criteria for high 
exposure risk according to standard NINJA criteria. 
Hypothesis 1: Urine NGAL is highly sensitive to detect NTMX -associated AKI 
A. Methods - We will continue to measure serum creatinine values daily according to 
current NINJA protocol.  A once daily urine sample will be obtained for 7 days from each participant who meets the high nephrotoxic medication exposure criteria (receiving 3 or 
more NTMx on the same day, or 3 or more days of an intravenous aminoglycoside).  We 
will collect urine using a urine bag, or collected as a natural void.  Urine will be processed, frozen and banked for future testing. Urine NGAL will be measured in batch 
in the CCHMC Clinical Lab which has the NGAL assay on their platform.  These results 
will not be posted in EMR. 
Hypothesis 2: Bedside testing of urine from high risk NTMx -exposed participants are 
adequate and reliable compared to uNGAL measured from the clinical  platform.  
A. Methods - using the urine collected above, we will evaluate urine NGAL using the 
Bioporto bedside POC test at the time of urine collection.  The POC assay is a 
 
 Page 4 colorimetric assay and a “low-risk” reading correlates with the clinical lab based NGAL 
reading of < 50 ng/ml. 
3. Study Design: 
This study is a multicenter prospective observational study.  
Using the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) generated report, at-risk patients will be identified 
which is part of our standard of care. At -risk patients are defined as patients meeting high-NTMx 
exposure criteria. Once identified as a potential research participant one of the research 
investigators will then contact [CONTACT_336418]. Once the research team has approval to approach the participant and 
family, one of the research study coordinator’s will then approach the participant/ participant’s  
family regarding potential enrollment and to obtain informed consent and assent as indicated. 
Once informed consent is given, a detailed medical record review will be performed on these 
participants ; which may include demographic information, medical history, medications, 
laboratory values, vital signs, and urinary biomarkers. Data from medical records will be 
abstracted into an electronic research database. Data collection sheets will be identified by a 
unique study identification number not based on PHI. A key linking participant names and 
medical record numbers to study identification numbers will be stored on a password-protected 
computer, separate from the study data, by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_28678].  
3A. Bone Marrow Transplant Repository 
Urine samples will be obtained from the Bone Marrow Transplant Repository who meet the 
NINJA criteria of 3 or more NTMx in a day or IV aminoglycosides given for three or more 
consecutive days. For those participants enrolled in the BMT Repository that meet NINJA 
criteria, once daily urine samples will be obtained from the Repository.  
4. Consent/HIPPA Authorization 
Non-BMT Participants : We plan to obtain informed consent from parents and directly from of-
age participants  if applicable- as well as assent from participants  over the age of 11- to 
participate in the study at the time of NTMx exposure. Before enrollment, permission from the attending physician caring for the participant will be obtained.  After permission is granted from 
the attending physician, consent will be obtained from the parents, legal guardian, or legally authorized representative in their primary language.  An interpreter will be provided if necessary. 
A short form consent in Spanish will be available  for Spanish speaking subjects.  If a subject 
speaks a language other than English or Spanish, a short form consent in their native language will be submitted to the IRB and approved prior to enrollment.  Because standard safeguards 
will be employed to protect PHI, this study represents no more than minimal risk to participants.  
The consent process and HIPAA authorization will not adversely affect the rights or welfare of 
participants.   
 
 Page 5 BMT Participants : Justification of Waiver of Consent & HIPAA Authoriz ation:  We are 
requesting a waiver of the informed consent process and requirement to obtain HIPAA 
authorization from participants enrolled in the BMT repository at CCHMC.  Use of their urine for 
NGAL involves the review of information that is already in existence at the time this research is 
being submitted and study staff will not have any direct contact [CONTACT_336419]. We believe the request for a waiver of consent and HIPAA 
authorization from BM T participant s who have consented to provide urine to the BMT repository 
meets the necessary criteria for a waiver of consent and HIPAA authorization per 
45CFR46.116(d) as follows:  
a. The use or disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) represents no more than 
minimal risk because:  
i. An adequate plan exists to protect the identifiers from improper use and 
disclosure. See “Potential risks, discomforts, and inconveniences: 
Mechanism proposed to minimize the participant ’s potential risks involving 
confidentiality” and “Security.”   
ii. There are adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be reused or 
disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for 
authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the 
use or disclosure of PHI would be permitted. See “Security.”  
b. The research could not practically be conducted without the access to and use of the 
PHI. Critically ill patients receiving care from BMT are eligible for multiple studies, 
both interventional and observational.  This patient population is also understandably 
under a great deal of stress and the BMT repository has been created to minimize 
multiple requests for study participation, specifically those involving collection of 
samples collected by [CONTACT_105]-invasive means, such as urine.  
5. Statistical Analysis Plan:  We plan to enroll at least 100 subjects, 30 of whom will need to 
develop AKI by [CONTACT_336420] (50% rise over baseline or a 0.3 mg/dl rise over baseline within 48 hours). If we have not enrolled at least [ADDRESS_415634] show that 15% 
of exposed participant s develop AKI.  For hypothesis 1, we will determine the sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of urine NGAL to detect NTMx -AKI. Our goal is to achieve a NPV of >98% using an uNGAL concentration of <50 ng/ml 
to rule out serum creatinine based AKI development.  For hypothesis 2, we will also assess sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for the POC “low -risk” test to predict a clinical lab based 
NGAL level of <50 ng/ml. 
Sample size estimates: With an assumption that [ADDRESS_415635] 1190 samples (170x 7 days) for participants without AKI.  Sample size analysis for 
non-inferiority (of NGAL to serum creatinine, of POC NGAL to clinical lab NGAL) reveals that we 
need 143 samples to be confident that we will not see a >2% discordance rate between the 
reference and test data set with a power of 0.[ADDRESS_415636] enough participant s if we enroll 200 total.  At the minimum of 100 participants, our power 
is 0.67.  
6. Security 
Participant confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study, through the use of a numeric 
coding system.  Data will be stored using a secure EDC system (REDCap ) and access will be 
limited to study staff.  
The records from this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371]. Representatives of Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] (“CCHMC”), the Investigator 
and CCHMC employees involved with the research study including the Institutional Review 
Board and the Office for Research Compliance and Regulatory Affairs, and any sponsoring 
company or their appointed agent as well as National  Institutes of Health / National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development, and the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration may also be allowed to inspect the medical and research records related to this study. If the 
results of this study are published, no Protected Health Information (PHI) will be disclosed, and 
subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300]. Research data will be stored in a secure location, with 
limited access .  
7.  Future Use 
The data obtained from sites will be saved according to HIPPA guidelines and will be 
maintained in a de-identified format in REDCap.  No PHI will be used for future research without 
prior IRB approval.  Urine samples will be maintained for a minimum of five years  and will not be 
used for future research without prior IRB approval.

Belmont Report: A document entitled “Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research” that was produced by [CONTACT_170209] 1978.  The Belmont Report identifies three fundamental ethical principles for all human subject research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.  Blinding:  When research subjects are unaware of the assigned “treatment.” In a single-blinded trial, the subjects do not know what treatment they are receiving.  In a double-blinded trial, the subjects and the investigators are unaware of the treatment assigned, as are the monitors and statisticians in some cases.    Case Report Form (CRF): A record of information collected on each subject during the clinical trial.  Clinical Investigation: A systematic trial designed to evaluate a test material in humans.   Clinical Research:  A trial in human subjects.  Clinical Trial:  Any investigation in humans meant to determine properties of a test material.

• Initial reading after [ADDRESS_199205] e xceed a wheal at the negative control by 4 mm.  
• A second reading is conducted about 6 hours after the SPT administration and similar 
measurements are taken.  
• The subjects return to the office [ADDRESS_199206] 
read ing and measurements.  
• A positive reaction is present when there is a measurable wheal of >3 mm . Small wheals 
are confirmed by [CONTACT_23302]. A flare alone is measured but is not of any clinical 
significance.   
 
7.8 Characteristics of Wheal  and Flare  
Wheals are determined by [CONTACT_170210]. If 
the wheal is not asymmetrical two diameters are measured (smallest and largest) and an 
average value is calculated. Flares, areas of erythema, are simi larly measured but are not 
considered clinically significant.

Follow-up of the AE, after the date of discontinuation of exposure to test material is required if the AE or its sequelae persist.  Follow-up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the PI   [INVESTIGATOR_170206].  8.2 Severity of Adverse Events The severity of each AE will be graded using the following criteria:  .  Grade Description 1 Mild – Minor AEs requiring no specific medical intervention including asymptomatic laboratory findings only, or finding of marginal clinical relevance 2 Moderate – AEs including urticaria requiring minimal, local, and/or noninvasive intervention 3 Severe – Severe and undesirable AEs involving significant symptoms requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006]; transfusion; elective interventional radiological procedure; or therapeutic endoscopy or operation

The patient will be evaluated at 15 minutes after SPT and then again at 6 hours after SPT.  Minor adverse events (e.g. itching at the skin test site) will be examined by [CONTACT_170213]; the PI [INVESTIGATOR_170208].  • Over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines will be given, which relieve minor symptoms.  Antihistamines prevent symptoms such as hives by [CONTACT_170214]. • Persistent itching, swelling or redness, will be reduced with ice and at the test site we shall apply 1% hydrocortisone cream one time. • Should the subject develop urticaria they will be provided with a 5 day course of antihistamine (10 mg cetirizine orally once daily)  While serious adverse events are not anticipated the most likely serious event would be a systemic allergic reaction or anaphylaxis which would most likely occur within [ADDRESS_199209] is under close evaluation at the CRC.  • The subject will be assisted to lie on their back with feet raised about 12 inches, clothing loosened to ease breathing, covered with a blanket and coached to stay calm.  They will be turned on their side if vomiting or bleeding.  • Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline) may be used, depending on the severity.

9 REPORTING  
9.1 Evaluation of Results – this simple study design, consists of only one physiological measure 
(that of wheal/flare) measured at 3 time points: T1 -15 minutes after SPT, T2=6hr after SPT and 
T3=24 -48 hrs. after SPT.  Our power analysis calculation indicates at a confidence level of 99% 
and confidence interval of 1.35, we will need a sample size of n=20.  No statistical analysis will be 
performed. No significant effect or interaction effects are anticipated hence the small sample 
size.  
9.2 Interim Reports  – unexpected findings will be reported to the Sponsor. At the conclusion of 
the study, a draft report will be sent to the Sponsor and contain all of the information to be 
included on the final report.  Comments made by [CONTACT_170215].  
9.3 Correction or Additions to the Final Report  – the sponsor w ill review the draft final report 
and make necessary edits prior to the final report being issued.

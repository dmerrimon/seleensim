Version #[ADDRESS_144079]. Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_35233] P -450 system 
(CYP3A). The plasma protein binding of tacrolimus is approximately 99%. Tacrolimus is bound mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The distribution of tacrolimus between blood and plasma depends on several factors including hematocrit, temperature at the time of plasma separation, drug concentration, and plasma protein concentration.   Pharmacodynamic studies have revealed that, depending on time following transplantation, maintaining whole blood trough levels between 5 and 20 ng/mL provides adequate protection against acute rejection and limits the occurrence of adverse events. The management of tacrolimus blood levels is complicated by [CONTACT_127804] - and inter- patient ab sorption, interaction with food and concomitant 
medications, and the relatively low bioavailability of tacrolimus from the Prograf formulation (17 ± 10% in adult kidney transplant patients).  
Previous studies examining immunosuppressants have shown that dr ug levels in the 
immediate post- transplant period are a major determinant of subsequent acute cellular 
rejection. It is known that tacrolimus (TAC) < 10 ng/mL is associated with increased 
rates of acute cellular rejection by [CONTACT_127805]-transplant.  
 
There is controversy regarding the appropriate dosing weight to use for 
immunosuppressants (IS). Weights use range from ideal body weight (IBW) to total body weight (TBW) depending on the institution and drug being dosed.  This becomes particularly important in the obese population when there are significant differences between IBW and TBW.  Our institution has always used IBW for the dosing of all IS due to concerns for nephrotoxicity with initial high blood levels of tacrolimus.  The concern in obese patients is that we are underdosing this population that could be at higher risk for rejection due to higher circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  The introduction of the novel use of a robotic 
transplantation procedure at our institution for this patient population has led to increasing numbers of transplant in obese recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; therefore,  we decided to re-evaluate our dosing protocol. Data from an internal study at UIC show that our use of IBW for tacrolimus dosing is not sufficient for th e obese population (body mass index 
[BMI] ≥30).  The dose used through month 3 was closer to 0.1 mg/kg/day when total body weight was utilized.  However, the use of an adjusted body weight (aBW) is 
Version #2

common for medication dosing in obese patients.  Adjusted body weight is calculated 
if the TBW is greater than 30% of the calculated IBW.  aBW = IBW + 0.4(TBW - IBW). There is limited data available supporting the use of either IBW or aBW in dosing tacrolimus within obese patients as these patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_127797], particularly the pharmacokinetic trials. In addition, no literature is available comparing the two dosing weights to determine which leads to therapeutic concentrations most effectively.   
Summary and Present Study 
Tacrolimus extended release (Astagraf) has recently been approved by [CONTACT_4760] a 
once a day dosing regimen.  This formulation has the potential to improve compliance. Current dosing recommendation for the extended release formulation in renal transplant is 0.15 mg/kg/day administered once daily in the morning. There are no specifications on appropriate dosing in obese patients or on whether to use actual, ideal or and adjusted weight.  It will be advantageous to understand the pharmacokinetics of this medicatio n in the obese to determine the appropriate dosing 
regimen. In this study, obese p atients will be randomized to receive tacrolimus 
extended release 0.15 mg/kg/day based on either ideal body weight (IBW) or adjusted 
body weight ( aBW).   
 
1.2       Descripti on of tacrolimus extended release 
ASTAGRAF XL is a calcineurin -inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated for the 
prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving a kidney transplant with 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, with or without  basiliximab induction  
 
Risks and Medication Interaction: 
This study poses no additional risks to the patient. Tacrolimus is a mainstay of immunosuppressant therapy at this healthcare organization. Safety data that is collected during the usual standard of car e visits will also be assessed in this study 
including: serum creatinine, graft function, and side effects. Additionally trough tacrolimus levels will be reviewed by [CONTACT_127806]. The safety data will be analyzed as descriptive data with reports of adverse effects in each study arm.   
 Since tacrolimus is metabolized mainly by [CONTACT_097]3A enzymes, drugs or substances known to inhibit these enzymes may increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. 
Drugs known to induce CYP3A enzymes may decrease tacrolimus whole blood 
concentrations.  Dose adjustments may be needed along with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations when ASTAGRAF XL is administered 
with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. In addition, patients should be monitored for 
adverse reactions including changes in renal function and QT prolongation. . Mycophenolic Acid Products 
Version #2 
September 19, 2016 Page 5 of 16 
 
 6 
With a given dose of mycophenolic acid (MPA) products, exposure to MPA is higher 
with ASTAGRAF XL  coadministration than with cyclosporine coadministration 
because cyclosporine interrupts the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA while 
tacrolimus does not. Clinicians should monitor for MPA associated adverse events and reduce the dose of concomitantly administered mycophenolic acid products, if needed. 
 Grapefruit Juice  
Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A -enzymes resulting in increased tacrolimus whole 
blood trough concentrations, and patients should avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice i n combination with ASTAGRAF XL. 
 Alcohol Consumption of alcohol with ASTAGRAF XL may increase the rate of release of tacrolimus and/or adversely alter the pharmacokinetic properties and the effectiveness 
and safety of ASTAGRAF XL. Therefo re, alcoholic  beverages should not be 
consumed with ASTAGRAF XL.  Protease Inhibitors  
Most protease inhibitors inhibit CYP3A enzymes and may increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of tacrolimus with nelfinavir unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Whole blood concentrations of 
tacrolimus are markedly increased when  coadministered with telaprevir or with 
boceprevir. Monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations and tacrolimus -
associated adverse reactions, and appropriate adjustments in the dosing regimen of tacrolimus are  recommended when tacrolimus and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, 
telaprevir, boceprevir) are used  concomitantly. 
 Antifungal Agents Frequent monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are  recommended when concomitant use of the following 
antifungal drugs with tacrolimus is initiated or discontinued . Azoles: Voriconazole, 
posaconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole and clot rimazole inhibit 
CYP3A metabolism of tacrolimus and increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. When initiating therapy with  voriconazole or posaconazole in patients 
already receiving tacrolimus, it is recommended that the tacrolimus dose  be initially 
reduced to one-third of the original dose and the subsequent tacrolimus doses be adjusted based on the tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. Caspofungin is an inducer of CYP3A and decreases whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus.  Calcium Channel Blocke rs 
Verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_127798]3A metabolism of tacrolimus and may increase  tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. Monitoring of 
whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended wh en these calcium channel blocking drugs and tacrolimus are used  
Version #[ADDRESS_144080]. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) St. John’s Wort induces CYP3A enzymes and may decrease tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when St.  John’s Wort and tacrolimus are 
coadministered.  
 Gastric Acid Suppressors/Neutralizers  
Lansoprazole and omeprazole, the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrates, share the same CYP3A4 system with tacrolimus for th eir hepatic 
elimination, and may potentially competitively inhibit the  CYP3A4 metabolism of 
tacrolimus and thereby [CONTACT_127807], especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor CYP2C19 metaboli zers 
in which the PPIs metabolic  pathway shifts from 2C19 to 3A4, as compared to those 
patients who are efficient CYP2C19 metabolizers.  Cimetidine, a CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, may also inhibit the CYP3A4 metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby [CONTACT_127808]. 
Coadministration with magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacids increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these drugs and tacrolimus are used concomitantly.

Other Drugs  
Amiodarone, bromocriptine, nefazodone, metoclopramide, danazol, ethinyl estradiol 
and methylprednisolone may inhibit CYP3A metabolism of tacrolimus and increase tacrolimus wh ole blood concentrations. Monitoring of blood concentrations and 
appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these drugs and tacrolimus are coadministered.  
 
Dosage and Administration  
The initial dose of tacrolimus extended release will be tacrolimus extended release  0.15 mg/kg/day given in the morning based on either IBW or aBW depending on which arm the patient is randomized.  Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain the target whole blood trough level of 8-12 ng/mL per institution transplant protocols.  ASTAGRAF XL is a once daily extended -release oral formulation of tacrolimus.  
To ensure consistent and maximum possible drug exposure, ASTAGRAF XL capsules should be taken consistently every morning, preferably on an empty stomach at least [ADDRESS_144081] 2 hours after a meal.  ASTAGRAF XL should be swallowed whole and should not be chewed, divided, or crushed.  Patients should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice in combination with ASTAGRAF XL.  If a dose of ASTAGRAF XL is missed, the dose may be taken up to 14 hours after the scheduled time.  Beyond the 14-hour time frame, the patient should wait until the usual scheduled time the following morning to take the next regular daily dose. It is not recommended to double the dose of ASTAGRAF XL to make up for the missed dose.  
Supply and Storage  
ASTAGRAF XL is supplied in short, square bottles as well as in blister cartons; the statement 'ONCE DAILY' appears on its label.  ASTAGRAF XL and tacrolimus immediate -release capsules are further differentiated by [CONTACT_127809].  
 Store and Dispense Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C-30°C (59°F-86°F).

1.  Difference in tacrolimus exposure (AUC24) in obese patients dosed using 
aBW compared to IBW.  
2. Difference i n the time to a therapeutic tacrolimus trough level in the aBW 
group compared to the IBW group. 
 
While there is limited data for dosing tacrolimus in the obese patient population internal data conducted at the University of Illinois Health System has demon strated a 
statistically significant difference between dosing based on ideal body weight and actual body weight.  Additionally  the acute rejection rate was 55% in obese patient s 
and 22% in non-obese patients, possibly as a result of under dosing in the obes e 
population. It is well established that low tacrolimus levels especially in the first week of transplant are associated with acute rejections. At the same time high tacrolimus levels increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.  Therefore, it is vital that the c orrect weight 
be utilized in dosing tacrolimus extended release, especially in a medication that will require a full day to wait for a dosage adjustment. The proposed endpoints will give the transplant community a better understanding of which weight to utilize in dosing this unique patient population. The AUC calculation will help to optimize the appropriate dosing in the obese patients to ensure a therapeutic level is maintained in a medication with high lipophilicity.

Please see INTRODUCTION of the BAY [ZIP_CODE] (CHEST -1) protocol.
In addition, the following aspects should be considered with respect to the long -
term exte nsion trial :
Based on the currentl y available scientific evidence, a large proportion of Chronic 
Thromboembolic Pulmonary  Hypertension (CTEPH) patients who are inoperable or 
who have a persistent pulmonary  hypertension after they underwent pulmonary 
endart erectom y (PEA) cannot be cured. Therefore, it can be assumed that their 
disease will progress over the years, requiring a long-term medical treatment to 
maintain their quality  of life and to increase their life expectancy .
Although the experiences with BAY 63-[ADDRESS_322062] -1 trial a long-term 
treatment with BAY 63-2521 (until commercially avail able).
In this context, it should be highlight edthat BAY 63-2521 revealed a positive 
benefit -risk ratio in the trials conducted in Pulmonary  Hypertension (PH) patients to 
date (trials # [ZIP_CODE] and # [ZIP_CODE]), allowing continuation of the development 
program. Moreover, in a first interim analysis of the extension phase of trial # 
[ZIP_CODE] (includes 21 patient s with a BAY 63-2521 treatment up to one year) the 
improvements in walking distance observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment 
were sustained without an y significant safet y concerns.
For further information refer to the Investigator Brochure .The Investigator’s 
Brochure will be updated at regular intervals during the conduct of the trial. New 
versions of the Investigator’s Brochure will be made available to the investigators 
without delay
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 7of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 82.STUDY  OBJECTIVES
To asses sthe long-term safety  and tolerability  of BAY 63-2521 in patients with 
inoperable Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary  Hypertension (CTEPH) or 
recurrent or persisting pulmonary  hypertension after sur gical treatment.
The trial provides patients, who have completed 16 weeks of BAY 63-2521 double 
blind treatment (CHEST -1 trial, # [ZIP_CODE]), the option of long-term treatment with 
BAY 63-2521.
Efficacy  assessments are included to provide an indication of main tenance of 
efficacy  with long -term treatment.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 84.INVESTIGA TIONAL  PLAN
4.1 Study Design and Plan
Multi centre , multinational, open label ,one arm study  in patients with CTEPH.
Study Phases:
 Treatment Phase:
Titration Phase: 8 weeks
Main-Study  Phase: Duration until BAY 63-2521 receives official 
approval and will be commerciall y available
 Safety  Follow Up Phase: 30 day s
BAY 63-2521 will be administered orally  as a tablet in doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0mg, 1.5
mg, 2.0 mg, and 2.5 mg tid.
Titrat ion Phase (8 weeks):
General aspects:
During the first eight weeks of the trial, patients from the Placebo Arm ofthe 
CHEST -[ADDRESS_322063] -2 study  medication 
(BAY 63-2521) is blinded with respect to the dose during the Titration Phase and 
investigators will not know at which dose level a certain patient enters the CHEST -[ADDRESS_322064] day of 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 9of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8CHEST -1.In contrast to that, all patients from the Placebo Arm of the CHEST -1 
trial will start at Visit 1 with a BAY 63-2521 dose of 1.0 mg tid.
To allow a blinded individual dose titration, the titration will be performed with the 
aid of an IVR-System. At each Titration Visit (with the exception of Visit 1) the 
investigator should decide, based on the patient’s systolic blood pressure, if the 
study  medication dose should be modified. The respective decision (increase, 
maintain or decrease dose) must be entered in the IVR-System that will 
automatically  allocate the right dose in accordance with the respective titration 
scheme. Afterwards, the investigator will be informed by [CONTACT_1190], which of the 
blinded medication bottles (blinded with respect to the dose) needs to be hand ed
over for the next titration period (starts alway s with the morning dose).
Independentl y from the patie nt’s allocation to a specific treatment arm in CHEST -1, 
the investigators will apply  the following blood pressure based titration rules for 
their dose decision in CHEST -2:
The individual study  medication dose of the next titration step will be 
determined every 2 weeks according to the peripheral SBP measured at trough 
before intake of the morning dose under consideration of the following 
algorithm (= individual dose titration scheme):
If trough SBP 95 mmHg ,increase dose (+0.5 mg tid) .
If trough SBP 90 -94 mmHg, maintain dose .
If trough SBP <90 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension ,reduce dose (-
0.5 mg tid) .
If any SBP <90 mmHg with clinical symptoms of hypotension such as 
dizziness or presyncope, stop study  treatment; restart after 24 hours with 
reduced d ose ( -0.5 mg tid).
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 10of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8In general, if the investigator requests an increase or decrease of study  medication 
dose via the IVR-System, the subsequent dose modification will not exceed 
plus/minus 0.5 mg study  medication.
Although the individual dose titration scheme is solely  based on the patient’s 
systolic blood pressure, investigators are obliged to consider in addition the 
patient’s well being. Therefore, it is allowed in case of study  medication side 
effects, to suspend a foreseen up -titration step and to main tain the dose.
To request an increase of study  medication dose is only possible at the planned 
study  visits Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 4.
The Titration Phase ends at day 56 (Visit 5). At this visit the actual dose of the 
patients will be unblinded by  [CONTACT_941] I VR-System.
Patients from the CHEST -1 Placebo Arm:
For patients from the CHEST -1 Placebo Arm the starting dose will be 1 mg 
BAY 63-2521 tid. The individual BAY 63-2521 dose will be titrated every 2 weeks 
according to the peripheral SBP measured at trough before intake of the next 
morning dose. At the end of the Titration Phase (Visit 5) patients will have reached 
BAY 63-2521 doses between 0.5 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Patients from the CHEST -1 Individual Dose Titration Arm:
Patient s from the BAY 63-[ADDRESS_322065] -1(Visit 7). Although the investigator will apply  during the 
Titration phase the same titration rules as for the CHEST -[ADDRESS_322066] -1.
If the investigator requests a dose increase above that level via the IVR-System, the 
patient will undergo a sham titration. Nevertheless, in case that the investigator 
requests a dose decrease (eg for safety  reason s), dose modifications are possible , but 
without a subsequent re -increase before Visit 5 .
Main -Study Phase (Duration until BAY 63-2521 receives official a pproval and 
will be commercially available ):
From Visit 5 on(begin of theMain -Study  Phase)investigators are allowed to 
modify  the BAY 63-2521 dose in a dose range between 0.5 mg tid and 2.5 mg tid 
according to the patient ’s need. In contrast to the Titration Phase, patients may be 
up-titrated between regular schedule visits .In this context, investigators have to

4.3 Removal of Patient s from Study
A patient who withdraws is one who discontinued in a clinical study  for any reason.
Patients may  be withdrawn from the study  for the following reasons:
At their own request .
At the specific request of the sponsor ( egdetection of a new significant 
safet y concern related to the study drug) .
Occurrence of adverse events or intercurrent diseases which the investigator 
judges unacceptable for continuation of p articipation in the study .
Occurrence of adverse drug reactions, which have from the investigator’s 
point of view, a negative impact on the patient’s individual Risk -Benefit 
Ratio (I nvestigators are obliged to reassess the patient’s individual Risk -
Benefit Ratio on a continuous basis. Factors like anticipated treatment effect, 
progression of underly ing disease, occurrence of side effects and alternative 
treatment options have to be considered) .

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Pertinent non -compliance with the conditions for the trial or i nstructions by  
[CONTACT_093] .
Although not intended, patients may  interrupt their intake of study  
medication due to various reasons (eg hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51531] a remote hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264875] , safet y reasons, side effects ). 
In case that aninterruption took place during the Titration Phase and 
lasts longer than 3 day s at a stretch (9 missing doses), it is not allowed to 
restart the stud y medication again (respective patients must be withdrawn 
from the trial). In case of shorter interruption s, it is at the discretion of 
the investigator if the study  medication can be restarted.
In case that aninterruption took place during the Main Study  Phase and 
lastslonger than 14 day s at a stretch, it is not allowed to restart the stud y 
medication again (respective patients must be withdrawn from the trial ). 
In case of shorter interruptions ,it is at the discretion of the investigator if 
the study  medication can be restarted.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 84.4 Premature Termination of Study/Closure of Centre
The sponsor has the right to close this study , and the investigator/sponsor has the 
right to close a centre , at any time, although this should occur only after 
consultation between involved parties. The EC/IRB must be informed. 
Reasons to close the study prematurel y ma y be for example:
If patients can be transferred to another clinical study  ortreatment program 
with BAY 63-2521 that ensures that patients who benefit can be treated with 
the compound until the drug receives official approval and will be 
commerciall y available.
The occurrence of a new relevant safet y related finding that has a negative 
impact on Risk -Benefit Ratio of the compound.
Should the study /centre be closed prematurely , all study  materials (except 
documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be returned to the sponsor. 
The investigator will retain all other document s until notification given by [CONTACT_264901].

4.5.3 Method of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups
Not applicable
4.5.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose selection for this study  was based on the following rati onale:
The dose range of 1.0 -2.5 mg tid was tested in health y volunteers in a multiple -
dose study  (study  [ZIP_CODE]). The highest dose of 2.5 mg tid showed a clear increase in 
adverse events and further escalation was stopped. A dose of 0.5 mg was identified 
in healthy  volunteers (study  [ZIP_CODE]) as the no-effect dose while 1.[ADDRESS_322071] dose level (5 mg). Therefore 1.0 mg tid 
was selected as the minimal dose and 2.5 mg tid as the maximum dose for further 
studies in patients (for further details refer to the Investigator Brochure). In an 
ongoing Phase II trial ([ZIP_CODE]) in patients with PAH and CTEPH the respective dose 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 17of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8range is tested in combination with an individual dose titration scheme. Based on 
interim analy ses doses between 1.[ADDRESS_322072] -1 
Individual Dose Titration Arm will remain on their “optimal dose” from CHEST -1 
(for further details refer to Section 4.1).
After an individual BAY 63-2521 dose has been determined all patients will enter 
the Main -Study  Phase (Visit 5) . During the Main -Study  Phase investigators are 
allowed to modify  the BAY 63-2521 dose according to the patient ’s need. In 
contrast to the Titration Phase, patients may  be up-titrated between regular schedule 
visits. The maximum allowed BAY 63-2521 dose is 2.5 mg tid, the minimum 0.5 mg 
tid (for further details refer to Section 4.1).
4.5.6 Blinding
Titration P hase:
To ensure the blinding of the treatment regimen of CHEST -[ADDRESS_322073] -2.
Main Study Phase:
During the Main-Study Phase the blinding of dosing will be removed and patien ts 
will be treated with “open label ” medication .
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 18of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 84.5.7 Concomitant Therapy
Titration Phase
The intake of the following concomitant medications is not allowed during the 
Titration Phase of the trial (after Visit 5 concomitant treatment is allowed) :
Endothelin Receptor Antagonists
Prostacy clinAnalogues
Patients, who require respective medications during the Titration Phase , need to be 
withdrawn from the study ( refer to Section 4.3“Removal o f Patients from Study ”).
Titration Phase and Main -Study Phase
The intake of the following concomitant medications is not allowed during the 
Titration Phase and the Main -Study  Phase of the trial:
Specific (egSildenafil or Tadalafil) or unspecific Phosphodi esterase 
Inhibitors ( egDipy ridamole, Theophy lline)
NO donors ( egNitrates)
Patients, who require respective medications, need to be withdrawn from the study 
(refer to Section 4.3“Removal of Patients from Study ”).
Other concomi tant therapy:
Due to possible pharmacokinetic interactions between BAY 63-2521 and 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg Ketoconazol) concomitant treatment should 
be applied with caution (eg additional blood pressure monitoring). Such 
drugs may significantl y increa se BAY 63-2521 plasma concentrations. In 
this context, dose reduction of BAY 63-2521 should be considered (eg –0.5 
mg tid), in particular if the patient suffers a clinical relevant decrease in 
blood pressure (eg systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg with clini cal 
symptoms). For further information refer to the Investigator Brochure.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 19of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Antacids like aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (eg Maaloxan ®) 
should not be taken simultaneously  with BAY 63-2521, because a negative 
impact on the bioavailability  of the study drug has been observed (please 
refer to the Investigator Brochure). To avoid such kind of interaction, 
antacids should be taken [ADDRESS_322074].
Pre-and co-treatment with Omeprazole led to a decrease in BAY 63-2521 
bioavailability , indicating a lower bioavailability  of BAY 63-2521 in neutral 
versus acidic milieu (for further information refer to the Investigator 
Brochure).
Preliminary  inspection of trough and peak plasma concentrations of 
BAY 63-2521 and BAY 60-4552 (Main BAY 63-2521 metabolite) in a 
cohort of patient s treated with bosentan (n=6) compared to the patient s not 
treated with bosentan (n=66) clearl y indicate a decrease in 
BAY 63-2521/BAY 60-[ADDRESS_322075] as patient s in the therapy  naïve cohort 
did (for further information refer to the Investigator Brochure, trial 1 2166).
Participation at a supportive physical training program , defined as a 
structured exercise and rehabilitation program supervised by a physician 
and/or a physiotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_264877] .However, later on during the Main Study  Phase participation at 
respective training program is allowed, but need to be documented in the 
electronic CRF.
Concomitant treatment in case of clinical deterioration:
In case of a clinical lyrelevant deterioration of the patient’s signs orsymptoms of 
pulmonary  hypertension the investigator may consider starting an alternative

Statistical analysis of safety variables
For the analysis of safet y, all patient s entering CHEST -[ADDRESS_322101] abnormalities, frequency  counts of incidence rates during the 
extension period (changed with amendment 8) and incidence per [ADDRESS_322102] measurements , vital signs, 
changes from baseline will also be summarized using descriptive methods (mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum).
Statistical analyses of other variables
Patient s will be included in these analy ses if they areincluded in the safety analy sis 
and have both baseline and post-baseline data available for the variable being 
analyzed. For Time To Clinical Worsening, incidence tables of the overall rate and 
the particular event leading to clinical worsening will be presented, together with 
the Kaplan -Meier survival curve. Change in Borg CR 10 Scale or Modified Borg 
Dyspnoea Scale and functional class at each visit will be summarized by [CONTACT_249615] y

in 6MWD ,NT pro-BNP , EQ-5D and LPHat each visit will be summarized using 
descriptive methods.
The study  endpoints related to health care resource utilization will be summarized 
using appropriate statistical methods: categorica l variables by [CONTACT_264909].  It is envisaged that all endpoints will be 
measured either on a semi -continuous scale or have ordered categories, and so 
exploratory  statistical tests will be ANCOVA or the stratified Wilcoxon test, 
depending on the distribution.
Statistical summaries
It is planned to produce two formal statistical summaries.  The first will be when all 
patients enrolled in the long-term extension at Last Patient First Treatment of the 
CHEST -[ADDRESS_322103] -1 study  has been unblinded 
(changed with amendment 8) . The second will be at the conclusion of this extension 
study .Additional summaries will be performed, at least on a yearly basis, to 
monitor long -term safet y.

7.ADVERSE EVENTS
7.1 Contraindications/ Warnings/Precautions /Interactions /Undesirable 
Effects
The potential for drug -drug pharmacod ynamic interactions, leading to an 
exaggerated vasodilatation and excess blood pressure d rop should alway s be 
considered if patients are treated concomitantly  with other drugs with vasoactive 
properties.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 42of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Concomitant treatment with specific or unspecific Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors 
leading to higher production and decreased degradation of cGMP is not allowed 
during the trial (refer to Section 4.5.7 “concomitant therap y”).
Due to possible pharmacody namic interactions, BAY 63-[ADDRESS_322104] not be 
administered together with NO donors/nitrates (refer to Section 4.5.7 “concomitant 
therap y”).
Due to possible pharmacokinetic interactions between BAY 63-2521 and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg Ketoconazol) concomitant treatment should be applied with 
caution (eg additional blood pressure monitoring). Such drugs may significantly 
increase BAY 63-2521 plasma concentrations. In this context, dose reduction of 
BAY 63-2521 should be considered (eg –0.5 mg tid), in particular if the patient 
suffers a clinical relevant decrease in blood pressure (eg sy stolic b lood pressure <90 
mmHg with clinical symptoms). For further information refer to the Investigator 
Brochure.
Antacids like aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide (eg Maaloxan ®) should 
not be taken simultaneously  with BAY 63-2521, because a negative impact on the 
bioavailability  of the study  drug has been observed (please refer to the Investigator 
Brochure). To avoid such kind of interaction, antacids should be taken [ADDRESS_322105].
Pre-and co-treatment with Omeprazole led to a decrease in BAY 63-2521 
bioavailability , indicating a lower bioavailability  of BAY 63-2521 in neutral versus 
acidic milieu (for further information refer to the Investigator Brochure).
Preliminary  inspection of trough and peak plasma concentrations of BAY 63-2521 
and BAY 60-4552 (Main BAY 63-2521 metabolite) in a cohort of patient s treated 
with bosentan (n=6) compared to the patient s not treated with bosentan (n=66) 
clearl y indicate a decrease in BAY 63-2521/BAY 60-[ADDRESS_322106] 
probably due to the known CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing effects of concomitant 
bosentan. However, patient s treated with bosentan profited in about the same 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 43of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8magnitude in the [ADDRESS_322107] as patient s in the therapy  naïve cohort did (for 
further information refer to t he Investigator Brochure, trial [ZIP_CODE]).
The BAY 63-2521 clearance was increased in smokers compared to non -smokers in 
a previous trial in patients with pulmonary  hypertension (IMP [ZIP_CODE]; see IB for 
more information). Therefore, patients should report their smoking status to the 
investigator.
Due to the pharmacological mode of action of a guan ylate cyclase stimulator, 
treatment with BAY 63-2521 may unmask existing Pulmonary  Veno-Occlusive 
disease (PVOD), leading to pulmonary  congestion and subsequent pulmona ry 
edema. Given the severity  of the underl ying disease this effect may be life-
threatening. Clinical symptoms of uncovering of a PVOD may occur weeks to 
months after start of treatment with BAY 63-[ADDRESS_322108] been observed in clinical 
trials: decrease in blood pressure (in healthy  volunteers mainl y diastolic blood 
pressure), postural h ypotension, dizziness, sy ncope, increase in heart rate, nasal 
congestion, feeling hot, headache, d yspepsia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, flushing, 
and hy perhidrosis (refer to the Investigator Brochure). Most of the undesirable 
effects are caused b y the vasodilators mode of action of the drug. The effects of the 
compound on smooth muscles may  lead to gastrointestinal sy mptoms (eg dilation of 
the esophageal sphincter with heartburn, esophagitis and dy sphag ia; diarrhea; 
constipation).
In addition, the possibility  of hitherto unforeseen side effects and allergic reactions 
to drugs, which can result in severe damage and even death, must alway s be 
considered.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Any new, relevant information about adverse drug reactions of BAY 63-2521 will 
be given to the patients (verball y and in writing).
Inadvertent overdosing with total daily  BAY 63 -2521 doses of 9 mg (13 and 
32days), 22.5 mg (14 and 15 day s), and 25 mg (2 day s) was reported for 5 subjects, 
which was tolerated without any  adverse events (for further information refer to the 
Investigator Brochure).
Overdosage following administration of BAY 63-2521 should be treated as 
clinically  indicated. There is no known antidote to BAY 63-2521.
Due to the pharmacological pr ofile of BAY 63-2521, cardiovascular effects as 
described in the Investigator Brochure ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) may be expected in case of 
overdose.
If symptoms develop after the investigational drug has been administered, any  
therap y that becomes necessary  has t o be guided by  [CONTACT_171114]. 
Patients have to remain under medical supervision until all relevant adverse effects 
have subsided. If adverse events occur, the investigator has to decide whether or not 
to remove the patient from the trial (refer to Section 4.3). Emergency  drugs and 
equipment has to be available to provide an y treatment, which may  become 
necessary.
In case of overdose, general measures to prevent absorption (eg, gastric lavage, 
activated charcoal) shoul d to be taken .
Note: To keep the investigators up-to-date regarding any kind of safety  relevant 
information the Development Core Safet y Information (DCSI), which is an 
appendix of the Investigators’ brochure, will be updated at regular intervals during 
theconduct of the trial. New versions of the investigator’s brochure will be made 
available to the investigators without delay .

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 87.[ADDRESS_322109] a causal relat ionship with this treatment.  An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the 
use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product.
Adverse events associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related, include the following:
An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in 
professional practice.
An adverse event occurring from an overdose whether accidental or intentional.
An adverse event occurring from drug abuse.
An adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal. 
An adverse events where there is a reasonable possibility  that the event occurred 
purely as a result of the patient s participation in the study  (eg adverse event or 
serious adverse event due to discontinuation of anti-hypertensive drugs during 
Wash-Out Phase) must also be reported as an adverse event even if it is not 
related to the investi gational product.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 46of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action is not 
recorded as an adverse event if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the 
electronic CRF. If, however, the event fulfills any of the criteri a for a “serious” 
adverse event, it must be recorded and reported as such.
7.3.[ADDRESS_322110] medical occurrence that at any  dose: 
Results in death.
Is life -threatening.
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32957].
Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacit y.
Is a congenital anomal y or birth defect.
Is an important medical event.
Life-threatening : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refe rs to 
an adverse event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It 
does not refer to an adverse event which hypothetically  might have caused death if 
it were more severe.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : Any adverse event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264888], UNLESS at least one of the following 
exceptions are met:
The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8954] 12 hours.
OR
The admission is pre-planned (ie elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to 
the start of the stud y). 
OR
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 47of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8The admission is not associated with an adverse event (eg, social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264889]).
However it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264890] ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as a 
serious adverse event dependent on clinical judgment . In addition where local 
regulatory  authorities specificall y require a more stringent definition, the local 
regulation takes precedent.
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264891] a routine right heart catheterization 
(RHC) procedure for conducting diagnostic invasive hemody namic measurements to 
evaluate a patient’s underly ing disease (without taking into account any clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_264892]) will not 
be considered as a serious adverse event. In this context, a RHC procedure is 
considered as a procedure and not as an adverse event (added with amendment 8) .
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal 
life’s functions.
Important medical event : Any  adverse event may be considered serious because it 
may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent another serious 
condition. As guidance for determination of important medical events refer to the 
“WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology  –Critical Terms List. These terms either 
refer to or might be indicative of a serious disease state. 
Such reported events warrant special attention becau se of their possible association 
with a serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action than reports on 
other terms.
7.3.3 Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse drug event, the specificity  or severit y 
of which is not consistent with the current Investigator Brochure (refer to Section 
8.1. “Development Core Safety  Information” of the Investi gator Brochure ). Also, 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 48of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8reports which add significant information on specificit y or severit y of a known, 
alread y documented adverse event constitute unexpected adverse events. For 
example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the Investig ator 
Brochure would be considered “unexpected”. Specific examples would be; (a) acute 
renal failure as a labeled adverse event with a subsequent new report of interstitial 
nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant hepatitis.
7.3.[ADDRESS_322111]
The assessment of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of study  
drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the 
completion of the case r eport form.
An assessment of ‘No’ would include:
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation eg, mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.
OR
2. Non-Plausibility  eg, the patient is struck by [CONTACT_264910] d disorientation that may have caused the event; 
cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few day s after the first drug administration. 
An assessment of ‘Yes’ indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_264893].
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug include: 
The temporal sequence from drug administration: The event should occur after 
the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be 
evaluated in the clinical context of the event.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 49of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8Recovery  on discontinuation (de-challenge), recurrence on reintroduction (re-
challenge): Patient ’s response after drug discontinuation (de-challenge) or 
patient s response after drug re-introduction (re-challenge) should be considered 
in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: Each report should be evaluated 
in the context of the natural history  and course of the disease being treate d and 
any other disease the patient may have.
Concomitant medication or treatment: The other drugs the patient is taking or 
the treatment the patient receives should be examined to determine whether any 
of them may  be suspected to cause the event in questi on.
The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: The pharmacokinetic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the test 
drug(s), coupled with the individual patient ’s pharmacod ynamics should be 
considered.
7.3.5 Severity of th e Adverse Event
The following classification should be used:
The severit y of adverse events should be graded as follows:
Mild –usually  transient in nature and generally  not interfering with normal 
activities.
Moderate –sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal activities
Severe –prevents normal activities.
7.3.[ADDRESS_322112] be 
fully recorded in the patient’s case record form. However, in case that more than 30 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 50of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8days after stop of study  medication an adverse event occurred that has been 
considered as related b y the investigator, this needs to be documented too.
Documentation must be supported by  [CONTACT_264911] ’s file.  A laboratory  test 
abnormality  considered clinically  relevant, eg, causing the patient to withdraw from 
the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged 
relevant by [CONTACT_093], should be reported as an adverse event.  Each event 
should be described in detail along with start and stop dates, severity , relationship to 
investigational product, action taken and outcome.
7.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events /Pregnancy
Serious adverse events (SAEs), including laboratory  test abnormalities fulfilling the 
definition of serious, that occurred in the period between the patient signed the 
informed consent and until [ADDRESS_322113] 
immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to the 
person detailed in the study  file. A serious adverse event form must also be 
completed within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness and forwarded to the 
designated perso n as detailed in the study  file. For reporting of serious adverse 
events an electronic adverse event form as provided in the electronic CRF shall be 
used. If the electronic CRF is not available due to technical problems (eg 
information cannot be entered into the electronic CRF ) serious adverse even ts need 
to be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness by [CONTACT_264912] (e.g. via fax). Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution 
or stabilization by  [CONTACT_264913].
If Global Pharmacovigilance requests supportive documents in context with a 
serious adverse event report (eg autops y report, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450]) these documents 
shall be forwarded to the person detailed in the study  file(eg via fax).
The same rules apply to serious adverse events that occurred more than 30 days 
after definite stop of study  medication, if the investigator considers them as related 
to the study  medication.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 51of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events 
must be reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory  Authorities.
Pregnancy  occurring during a clinical investigation, although not considered a 
serious adverse event, must be reported to Bayer within the same timelines as a 
serious adverse event on a Pregnancy  Monitoring Form. The outcome of a 
pregnancy  should be followed up carefull y and any abnormal outcome of the 
mother or the child should be reported. This also applies to pregnancies following 
the administration of the investigational product to the father prior to sexual 
intercourse .
7.[ADDRESS_322114] ha sbeen defined:
Syncope
Any syncope has to be reported as “i mportant medical event” (see section 7.3.2 ) and 
therefore as Serious Adverse Event (SAE) to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_322115] to the sponsor thirty  days in advance of 
submission in order to obtain approval prior to submission of the final version for

unreasonabl y. In case of a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_264894](s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a 
solution which satisfies both parties.

10.4 6 Min Walking Distance (6MWD) Test
The 6MWD Test must be performed in accordance with the American 
Thoracic Societ y Guideline ( American Thoracic Society . ATS Statement: 
Guidelines for Six-Minute Walk Test. American Journal of Respi[INVESTIGATOR_264898] 2002; V ol 166. pp 111 -117)
According to the guideline, the 6MWD Test should be carried out 
indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with hard surface 
that is seldom traveled. The walking course should be preferabl y30 m in 
length , but not less than 25 meters (longer walking courses should be 
shortened to 30 m).The length of the corridor and turnaround points 
should be marked.
Patients will be instructed to walk alone, not run, from one end to the 
other end of the walking course, at their own pace, while attempting to 
cover as much ground as possible in [ADDRESS_322131], but should resume walking as soon as they  feel able to do so.
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 64of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed. The 
patients should sit at rest in a chair, locate d near the starting position, for 
at least [ADDRESS_322132]. To 
allow reproducibility , standardized phrase s should be used every minute 
according to the following pattern:
After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): 
“You are doing well. You have 5 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
followi ng: “Keep up the good work. You have 4 minutes to go.”
When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
following: “You are doing well. You are halfway  done.”
When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the 
following: “Keep up the good work. You have only  2 minutes left.”
When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: 
“You are doing well. You have onl y 1 minute to go.”
To reduce the variability of the 6MWD Tests, it is of utmost importance 
that the eligibility -test, the baseline -test and all following tests are 
performed under the same conditions (changed with amendment 8) :
Patients, who used walking aids alread y at the eligibility -test and the 
baseline -test (eg cane, walker), need to use the same walking aids at
every  subsequent 6MWD Test.
For quality  reasons, the inhalation of supplemental oxygen and the use 
of walking aids during the 6MWD Tests must be documented in the 
electronic CRF.
In case that a patient has never performed a 6MWD Test, a 
familiarization test should be performed during the Pre-Treatment Phase. 
To avoid any interactions, it is not permitted to perform the 
familiarization test on the same day  as the eligibility  6MWD Test.

Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 810.5 Borg CR 10 Scale®or Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale (if 
applicable)
In context with [ZIP_CODE] protocol amendment 3 the “Modified Borg 
Dyspnoea Scale” was replaced by [CONTACT_264902] 10 Scale®. For 
consistency  reason, patients who were enrolled before approval of [ADDRESS_322133] usethe “Modified Borg 
Dyspnoea Scale” throughout the main and the extension study .
The Borg CR 10 Scale or the Modified Borg Dy spnoea Scale (if 
applicable )will alway s be measured in conjunction with the 6MW D 
Test.
The Borg CR 10 Scale or the Modified Borg Dy spnoea Scale (if 
appli cable )will be explained to the patients before starting the 6M WD 
Test ( questionnaires and instructions will be provided in local language). 
Patients will be asked to rank their exertion at the end of the 6MWD 
Test. If a patient has problems to understand the principles of rating, an 
attempt should be made to explain the principles in a neutral and 
unpersuasive manner.
The test result will be entered on same work sheet as the 6MWD Test 
result .Later on the results will be transferred into the electronic CRF .
10.5.[ADDRESS_322134] look at the verbal expressions. Start with them and then the 
numbers. Of these ten (10) or ”Extremel y strong”, “Maximal” is a very 
important intensity  level. This is the most intense perception or feeling 
you have ever had.
If your experience or feeling is “Very weak”, you should say “1”, if it is 
“Moderate”, say  “3”. Note that “Moderate” is “3” and thus weaker than 
“Medium”, “Mean” or “ Middle”. If the experience is “Strong” or 
Integrated Protocol /BAY 63-2521/[ZIP_CODE]  Page 66of 75
Final Version 1.0/Date 13 Dec 2012/AMD 8“Heav y” (it feels “Difficult”) say  “5”. Note that “Strong” is about half of 
“Maximal”. I s your feeling “Very  strong”, choose a number from 6 to 8. 
If your perception or feeling is stronger than ”10”, -“Extremely  strong”, 
“Maximal” –you can use a larger number, e.g. 12 or still higher (that’s 
why “Absolute maximum” is marked with a dot “ ●”).
It's very  important that you report what y ou actually  experience or feel, 
not what y ou think y ou should report. Be as spontan eous and honest as 
possible and try  to avoid under -or overestimating. L ook at the verbal 
descriptors and then choose a number. 
When rating your exertion give a number (in principle any  kind of 
decimal number is allowed) that corresponds to how hard and s trenuous 
you perceive the work to be. The perception of exertion is mainly  felt as 
strain and fatigue in your muscles and as breathlessness or an y aches.
0 ”Nothing at all”, means that y ou don’t feel any  exertion 
whatsoever, no muscle fatigue, no breathle ssness or difficulties 
breathing.

10.5.2 Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale
Patients will be asked to rank their exertion. The rate of exertion will be 
given according to the following score ranging from 0 to 10:
0: nothing at all,
0.5: just noticeabl e, 
1: very  slight,
2: slight,
3: moderate, 
4: somewhat severe,

10.6 WHO functional class
The patient’s functional class will be determined by [CONTACT_264914] (Class I -IV / refer to American College of Chest 
Physicians. Diagnosis and Management of Pulmonary  Arterial 
Hypertension: ACCP Evidence -Based Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
Chest 2004; 126; 7 -10s):
I: Patients with PH but without resulting limitation of physical activit y. 
Ordinary  physical activity  does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, 
chest pain, or near s yncope.
II: Patients with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activit y. 
They  arecomfortable at rest. Ordinary  physical activity  causes undue 
dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near s yncope.
III: Patients with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity . 
They  are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity  causes undu e 
dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near s yncope.
IV: Patients with PH with inability  to carry  out any  physical activity  
without sy mptoms. These patients manifest signs of right -heart failure. 
Dyspnoea and/or fatigue may  even be present at rest. Discomfo rt is 
increased b y any physical activity .

EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health 
outcome. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value 
for health status. The EQ -5D is a self -report questionnaire and nee ds to 
be completed b y the patient (questionnaires will be provided in local 
language). However, if the patient has problems completing the 
questionnaire, an attempt should be made to explain the questions in a 
neutral and unpersuasive manner.
After the patient has filled in the questionnaire, the questionnaire is 
transferred to the study  personnel, who will enter the content into the 
electronic CRF.

The L PHquestionnaire is designed to measure the effects of PHand PH 
specific treatments on an individual’s quality  of life.
The L PHis a self -report questionnaire and needs to be completed b y the 
patient (questionnaires will be pro vided in local language). However, if 
the patient has problems completing the questionnaire, an attempt should 
be made to explain the questions in a neutral and unpersuasive manner.
After the patient has filled in the questionnaire, the questionnaire is 
transferred to the stud y personnel, who will enter the content into the 
electronic CRF.
To measure the effects of sy mptoms, functional limitations, 
psychological distress on an individual’s quality  of life, the L PHasks 
patients to indicate using a 6 -point, zero to five, Likert scale how much 
each of 21 facets prevented them from living as they  desired.

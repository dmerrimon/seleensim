and Reference treatments, and the superiority of each active treatment over the Placebo, will be based on each treatment’s mean
 percent change from Baseline 
to Week 12 in the number of inflamed and non- inflamed lesions.  
The statistical analyses will involve Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with 
terms for treatment and site as fixed effects in the model.  
Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Therapeutic Equivalence  Analysis 
The primary measure of therapeutic equivalence will be  evaluated using 
the PP population, with results in the mITT population being supportive . 
Under the assumptions of normally distributed data, t he adjusted 90% 
confidence interval  will be calculated for the Test/Reference ratio of the 
mean percent change from Baseline in inflammatory  and non-
inflammatory  lesion count s using an iterative procedure similar to Fieller’s 
method. ANOVA with treatment and site as fixed effects in the model will 
be conducted on the mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules/pus tules) lesion counts and non- inflammatory 
(open and closed comedones) lesion counts. 
If the adjusted 90% 
confidence intervals for the least -squares mean Test/Reference ratios are 
within 80 -125% for both co- primary endpoints, then t herapeutic 
equivalence of the Test to Reference product will be  considered to have 
been demonstrated . 
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference 
product, therapeutic equivalence must be demonstrated for only the 
primary endpoint s in the PP population. 
Superiority to Placebo Analysis 
The primary me asure of superiority  will be  evaluated using the mITT 
population, using last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing 
efficacy values. The results in the PP population will be considered 
supportive. The s uperiority of the Test and Reference products over 
Placebo is concluded if the se treatments’ mean percent changes from 
Baseline in inflamed and non- inflamed lesion counts at Week 12 are 
statistically superior to that of the Placebo at the 5% significance level ( p 
< 0.05, two- sided ). The superiority of Test and Reference treatments over

mITT population. 
Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The PP population will be used for analysis of  therapeutic  equivalence and 
the mITT population will be used for analyses of superiority . 
Therapeutic Equivalence  Analysis 
For the proportion of Clinical Success, if the 90% confidence interval (with 
Yates’ Correction factor) of the difference between the proportion of 
subjects considered a Clinical  Success in the Test and the Reference 
product groups at Week 12 is contained within -20% to +20%, then 
therapeutic equivalence of the Test to Reference product will be 
considered supported for the secondary endpoint. 
Superiority to Placebo Analysis

treatments using Fisher’s exact test or a similar test. Application  site reactions  
(erythema , dryness , burning/stinging, e rosion , edema , pain , itching ) recorded 
at each visit will be compared among treatment groups. A descriptive analysis 
comparing the application site reactions for each treatment group will be 
created.

an extent that the Investigator/subject  considers that it is in the subject ’s best 
interest to be dropped from continued participation in the study and given 
alternative therapy for their condition. 
All randomized subject s who received IP will be included in the comparative 
safety analysis. The electronic c ase report forms for the study can allow for 
reporting by [CONTACT_68567] [ADDRESS_75111] s with nodulocystic acne. Subjects who worsen beyond Grade 4 will be

Sample Size Determination For the primary endpoint analysis (percent change from Baseline at Week 12 
(Study Day 8 5 ± 4 days) in inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesion count), 
sample size is estimated for therapeutic equivalence of the Test to the 
Reference product and superiority of each of the active treatments groups over Placebo. As no variability data were available for TAZORAC
® cream, 0.1%, 
the sample size estimations are based on data reported in the  
 Sample size 
calculations were performed using . 
In the PP population, the mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesion count 
in the Reference treatment group at Week [ADDRESS_75112] deviation (SD) of  (coefficient of variation of

Reference treatment group at Week 12 is expected to be approximately

a sample size of  subject s per active treatment group in the PP population 
will provide  approximately  power to demonstrate that the adjusted 90% 
confidence interval for the T/R ratio of least- squares treatment means for the 
primary endpoint is contained within the pre -defined equivalence limits [ 80%,

Though signs and symptoms of acne are cosmetically embarrassing and socially stressful, the risk of 
serious m edical complications arising from acne is low.  
The clinical appearance of acne can range from very mild (a few comedones on the face) to very severe (large cysts and nodules on the face, chest and back). Subjects selected for this study are considered to 
have facial acne with ≥ 25 non- inflammatory facial lesions (open and closed comedones), ≥ 20 
inflammatory facial lesions (papules and pustules) , ≤ 2 facial nodul ocystic lesions and an Investigator’s 
Global Assessment ( IGA) grade of 2, [ADDRESS_75117] . There are a number of different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_68544]. For mild cases, good skin hygiene and over -the-counter (OTC) anti -bacterial washes and scrubs 
have been shown to control the signs and symptoms. Retinoids, antimicro bials and antibiotics are the 
mainstay of topi[INVESTIGATOR_68545]. Such treatments are active at application sites, and they can prevent new lesions.

expression of a presumed pro- inflammatory marker, migration inhibitory factor related protein type 8 
(MRP8), suggesting a direct anti -inflammatory effect. In addition to its effects on the precursor

8.3 Scientific and Statistical  Considerations  
Tazarotene has low systemic absorption and rapid elimination from  semi -solid topi[INVESTIGATOR_68547]® with mean peak plasma concentrations of tazarotenic acid of 0.10  ng/mL observed on 
Day 15 following once daily application of tazarotene cream , 0.1% to the face of subject s with facial 
acne vulgaris.9 The 21 Code of Federal Regulations Sections 320.24 (Revised April  1, 2014) requires 
that in -vivo pharmacokinetic testing in humans is the preferred method in evaluating therapeutic 
equivalence. However, circumstances for which measurement of the active moieties in biological fluids 
is not poss ible or provides low concentrations , a pharmacodynamic response study indicative of clinical 
efficacy can be considered.10-12 Based on the low systemic bioavailability of tazarotene from  the topi[INVESTIGATOR_68548]

9.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are to:  
1. Evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the Test product, Tazarotene Cream 0.1% (Fougera 
Pharmaceuticals Inc.) to the Reference product, TAZORAC® (tazarotene) Cream 0.1% (Allergan, 
Inc.) in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
2. Demonstrate the superiority of the efficacy of the Test and Reference (active) products over that of 
the Placebo in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
3. Compare the safety of the Test, Reference and Placebo products in the treatment of acne vu lgaris.  
10.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
10.1 Study Design and Plan Description  
This multi- center , double -blind, randomized, vehicle- controlled, parallel -group bioequivalence clinical 
study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a generic tazarotene cream  0.1% (Fougera 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) compared to the FDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD) TAZORAC® (tazarotene)  
Cream , 0.1% (Allergan) in subject s with a clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris. Additionally, both the 
Test product and Reference (i.e., the RLD) product  will be tested for superiority to a Placebo. Subject s 
with confirmed facial acne vulgaris will apply the investigational product (IP) once daily , in the 
evening, for 84 days ± 4 days  (12 weeks).  
Before any study -specific procedures are performed, all subject s will read and sign the IRB -approved 
ICF. For a subject considered to be a minor in the state he/she is screened , the parent or legal guardian 
will be required to sign the ICF and the subject  will sign an IRB -approved “assent to participate” form , 
as applicable. 
Each site will develop an individualized recruitment plan to collectively enroll approximately  [ADDRESS_75125] s, ≥ 12 to ≤ 40 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris and meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . Subjec ts will be randomized to one of the three IPs  as follows:  
• Test:  Tazarotene Cream 0.1% (Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) 
• Reference : TAZORAC® (tazarotene) Cream, 0.1% (Allergan, Inc.) 
• Placebo : Placebo (vehicle) Cream  (Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) 
Subject s will  attend the following scheduled clinic visits:  
• Visit 1  - Screening/Baseline: Day -14 to 1 
• Visit 2  - Interim Visit: Day 28 ± 4 days 
• Visit 3  - Interim Visit: Day 56 ± 4 days 
• Visit 4  - End of Study /Early Termination : Day 8 5 ± 4  days

who continue to be eligible for continuation in the study can be dispensed a nother  of 
investigational product, as needed, based on the amount of IP remaining from the tube previously 
dispensed. Further, any empty tubes will be collect at these visits. At Visit 4, all tubes will be collected 
(used and unused). A subject may return for an Unscheduled Visit at any time, should they require a 
resupply of IP (i.e., tube lost; all IP used between vis its). It is estimated that up to  will be needed 
to dose the subject for the treatment period. Additional tubes beyond the initial  will only be 
dispensed if the initial supply is lost  and/or significantly damaged (i.e., becomes punctured) and 
warrants replacement . 
The day that the subject administers their first dose of IP will be considered Day 1.  
 
 
 
For all other subjects, the first dose (Day 1) of IP 
will be applied on the evening of Visit 1. 
The subject will be instructed  to apply a thin layer (2 mg/cm2) of the product once  daily , in the evening , 
through the evening before Visit 4 (Day 85 ± 4) . There will be no application of the product on the day 
of the End of S tudy visit.  
Efficacy evaluations will be based on dermatological assessments in the clinic. The primary statistical 
analyses of interest are (1) the mean  percent change from Baseline to  Week 12 in the inflam matory  
(papules/pustules) lesion  count s and (2) the mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non -
inflam matory  (open and closed comedones) lesion count s. The secondary analysis is the proportion of 
subjects who are considere d a Clinical Success at Week 12, as defined by [CONTACT_68571] 
2 grades less than the Baseline assessment.  A Clinical Failure is defined as an IGA score that is the 
same, higher or one grade lower than the Baseline IGA  at Week 12 (Appendix A).

treatment will be included in the Per-Protocol (PP)  population as treatment failures provided they 
had no significant protocol deviations  (PDs) . Any PD that would compromise the  integrity of the 
data will be considered significant.  
Subjects who discontinue  early due to a worsening condition and require alternate or supplemental 
therapy for the treatment of acne during the study should be discontinued, included in the PP 
population analysis as treatment failures (provided they had no significant PDs during their time of 
study participation), and referred for effective treatment outside of the study. 
Subject s who discontinue early for reasons besides lack of treatment effect or worsening of 
condition should be excluded from the PP population, but included in the modified Intent- to-Treat 
(mITT) population using the last observation carried forward (LOCF ), provided they administered 
at least one dose of randomized IP  and completed at least one post -dose evaluation.

At Visit 1, eligible subjects will receive  of randomized IP (Test, Reference or 
Placebo). 
At Visit 2 and/or Visit 3, subjects who continue to be eligible for continuation in the study can be 
dispensed a   of IP, as needed , based on the amount of IP remaining from the 
tube previously dispensed . Further, any empty tubes will be collected  at these visits. At Visit 4, all 
tubes will be collected (used and unused). A subject may return for an Unscheduled Visit at any 
time, should they require a resupply of IP (i.e., tube lost; all IP used between visits ; tube  
significantly damaged [became punctured] ).

At Visits 2, [ADDRESS_75164] s will be questioned regarding any changes in their medical status since 
their previous visit. Any significant health changes observed af ter signing of the ICF  will be 
reported as AEs, as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. 
10.7 AEs/ SAEs  
The subjects will be monitored throughout the study for any AEs. AEs will be collected through both 
solicited and unsolicited means and subsequently coded in tabular form using the MedDRA (Version 
18.1 or higher) Adverse Event Dictionary. The subjects will be requested to report signs, symptoms  
and any changes in heal th to the clinic staff. Observed changes during the dermatology exam and/or 
clinical assessment at each visit (i.e., changes in the application site reaction) should be assessed by [CONTACT_68581] (in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) if the change should be reported as an AE  or not. Severity 
of each AE will be determined by [CONTACT_68582]. The 
Investigator will judge the relationship of the event to the study treatments.  
10.7.1  Definitions  
An Adverse Event / Experience i s any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom  or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
An S AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68556]

 • results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
• is medically significant: Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in deciding 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68557]. These should also usually be considered serious.  
These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time of the event. For example, regarding a life- threatening event, this re fers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  is any AE for which the Investigator or s ponsor assess a 
reasonable possibility for a causal relationship to a medicinal product, see 10.7.[ADDRESS_75165], the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the Reference Safety Information (Appendix D ). The term ‘severity’ is used here 
to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be distinguished from the term ‘serious’. 
Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence or severity of 
a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events.  
Information about common side effects already known about the IP can be found in the Reference 
Safety Information ( Appendix D) or will be communicated in the form of Investigator 
Notifications. These common side effects are also listed on the informed c onsent. The common 
side effects will be discussed with the subjects prior to their signing of the informed consent.  
For further details, please refer to the “Quick Reference Guide for C ompleting the SAE Form” for 
completing the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form” ([COMPANY_001] form).  
10.7.2  Severity of A Es 
The term ‘severity’ is used here to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be 
distinguished from the term ‘serious’. In the cou rse of the study, the Investigator will determine 
whether any AEs  have occurred and will grade their severity as follows:  
Mild:  Transient or mild discomfort (<48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy 
required  
Moderate:  Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
Severe:  Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]

 The Investigator should assess whether or not, in his/her expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE is suspected to the 
drug according to the following considerations: 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study treatment 
administration mak es a causal relationship possible, and other 
drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study treatment 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely , or other drugs, 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event. 
Causality assessments are critical and must be provided for each unique AE in relation to each IP. 
Missing causality assessments will be handled as suspected to IP by [CONTACT_456].  
10.7.4  AE Documentation 
Any AE (non- serious and serious) occurring after the subject has provi ded study- specific informed 
consent, and until the last study visit of the subject, has to be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. AEs also may be identified when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_68583], laboratory test or other assessments. All AEs should be given appropriate medical care. Treatment may include one or more of the following : no action 
taken (i.e. , further observation only); IP dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; IP permanently 
discontinued due to this AE; concomitant medication given; non- drug therapy given, subject  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] / subject ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18533]. The treatment of the AE should be documented 
in the eCRF. In addition, the action taken with the IP should be documented, and should be assigned 
to one of the following categories: not changed, withdrawn, reduced, increased, interrupted, unknown and not applicable. Concomitant medication, other treatments or changes in the 
administration of the IP should be specified and documented.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting IP are only considered AEs if they worsen after 
enrollment. Abnormal laborator y values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant  or require therapy.  
Once an AE is identified, the Investigator should follow -up as specified below. Each time, the 
outcome should be documented and assigned to one of the following categories: not 
recovered/unchanged, condition deteriorating, recovered/resolved, improving/recovering, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal or unknown. The assessment of an AE should be made at each planned visit (or more frequently, if necessary). The Investigator should document in the 
eCRF any changes in seriousness, severity, the suspected relationship with the IP, the interventions 
required to treat it, and the outcome. 
AEs occurring between informed consent and first dosing 
Any AE occurring between study- specific informed consent and first dosing will be documented 
as “screening event”, with an IP causality assessment “IP not yet administered”.

It is vitally important that the Investigator reports immediately , (i.e., no later than 24 hours 
after awareness), any SAEs or updates to previously reported SAEs, even if the Investigator does 
not consider the AE  to be drug -related.  
The Investigator  should send SAE reports on the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form” ([COMPANY_001] 
form), as initial or follow -up reports, via fax or email to the Local Person for Pharmacovigil ence 
(LPPV ) (listed below), and in copy to the responsible Medical Monitor/CRO Contact [CONTACT_68584] (listed below), to the email addresses provided in the table below. 
The Investigator  should also send all updates / new information on a new SAE Report Form as a 
follow-up to the previously reported S AE. The follow -up information should describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues, if a diagnosis is available, if and how it was treated, and whether 
the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. 
Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow-up 
to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], regardless of when the event occurs.  
Any new SAE (that is considered completely independent of a previously reported SAE) should be 
reported as a new and separate initial SAE report.  
Any queries from the LPPV, CRO or Sponsor regarding SAE reports should be answered by [CONTACT_68585] 24 hours. 
For more detailed information refer to the “Quick Reference Guide for Completing the SAE Form”.  
The Investigator  should retain a delivery notification for all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_68559].

 The e CRFs / the clinical database will be reviewed  for potentially unreported cases. For any 
reportable case, the following parameters need to match exactly between the clinical and the safety 
database: trial number, site number, subject identification number, investigational drug, 
seriousness, date of death (if applicable) and Investigator  causality. All other parameters only need 
to be plausibly and medically cons istent. For any SAE  assessed as suspected, a more detailed 
reconciliation should be conducted, including also treatment dates and medical history. 
11.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 Statistical Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), including study data report format, detailing the intended statistical 
analysis of the study data, will be prepared as a separate document and finalized before database lock. 
Any deviation from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the final report, as appropriate. The procedure for accounting for missing, unused and spurious data will be included in 
the S AP. 
If not otherwise specified, statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05, t
 wo-sided.  Data will be 
summarized with respect to demographic and Baseline charact eristics, efficacy variables and safety 
variables.  
 
All s
tatistical analysis will be conducted using SAS®, Version 9.4 or higher. Datasets will be prepared 
using headings from Clinical Data Interchange Consortium (CDISC), Study Data Tabulation Model  
(SDTM) implementation for human clinical trials, and Analysis Dataset Model  (ADaM ). 
11.2 Sample Size Determination  
For the primary endpoint analysis (percent change from Baseline at Week 12 (Study Day 85 ± 4  days ) 
in inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion count), the sample size is estimated for therapeutic 
equivalence of the Test to the Reference product and superiority of each of the active treatments groups 
over Placebo. As no variability data were available for TAZORAC® Cream, 0.1%, t he sample si ze 
estimations are based on data reported in the   
 Sam
ple size calculations were performed using  
In the  
PP population, the mean percen t reduction in inflammatory lesion count in the Reference 
treatment group at Week 12 is expected to be approximately , with a SD of  (coef ficient 
of variation of ). The mean  percent reduction in non-inflammatory lesion count in the Reference 
treatment group at Week 12 is expected to be approximately , with a SD of  (coefficient of 
variation of ). Based on these numbers, a sample size of  subject s per active treatm ent group in 
the PP population will provide approximately  power to demonstrate that the adjusted 90% 
confidence interval for the T/R ratio of least- squares treatment means for the primary endpoint is 
contained within the pre -defined equivalence limits [80%, 125% ], if the true ratio is  and

assuming  correlation between the inflamed and non -inflamed lesi on counts and  correlation 
between the two superiority tests for each endpoint . Under the above assumptions, the overall study 
power to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence  and superiority for the primary endpoint is estimated to 
be at least . To allow for approximately  subject s who may drop out from

11.6 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Therapeutic Equivalence  Analysis  
The primary measure of therapeutic equivalence will be  evaluated using the PP population, with results 
in the mITT population being supportive . Under the assumptions of normally distributed data, t he 
adjusted 90% confidence interval  will be calculated for the Test/Reference ratio of the mean percent 
change from Baseline in inflammatory  and non- inflammatory  lesion count s using an iterative procedure 
similar to Fieller’s method. ANOVA with treatment and site as fixed effects in the model will be 
conducted on the mean percent change from Baseline to Week 1 2 in the inflam matory  
(papules/pustules) lesion  count s and non- inflammatory  (open and closed comedones) lesion count s. If 
the adjusted 90% confidence interval s for the least-squares mean Test /Reference ratios are within 80-
125% for both co- primary endpoint s, then therapeutic equivalence of the Test to Reference product will 
be considered to have been demonstrated . 
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product, therapeutic 
equivalence must be demonstrated for only the primary endpoints in the PP population. 
Superiority to Placebo Analysis 
The primary me asure of superiority  will be  evaluated using the mITT population, using LOCF  for 
missing efficacy values. The results in the PP population will be considered supportive . The superiority 
of the Test and Reference products over Placebo is concluded if the se treatments’ mean percent change s 
from Baseline in inflamed and non- inflamed lesion counts at Week 12 are statistically superior to that 
of the Placebo at the 5%  significa nce level ( p < 0.05, two-sided). The superiority of Test and Reference 
treatments over the Placebo will be evaluated in the same ANOVA model  for Test vs. Placebo and 
Reference vs. Placebo . 
To declare superiority  of the Test and Reference  product s over Placebo, their superiority  must be 
demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the mITT population. 
11.7 Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The PP population will be used for analysis of  therapeutic  equivalence and the mITT population will 
be used for analyses of superiority.  
Therapeutic Equivalence  Analysis 
For the proportion of Clinical Success, if the 90% confidence interval  (with Yates’ Correction  factor ) 
of the difference between the proportion of subjects considered a C linical Success in the Test and the 
Reference product groups at Week 12 is contained within -20% to +20% , then therapeutic equivalence

 12.3.9  Pregnanc y and Breastfeeding  
Tazarotene cream is designated as Pregnancy Category X; therefore there is a potential risk of 
teratogenicity. Therefore, all females of childbearing potential should be maintained on an 
appropriate method of contraception throughout the study  to prevent pregnancy. Females that are 
lactating, breastfeeding or trying to become pregnant should not be enrolled in the study. The ICF 
will clearly outline the risk and this requirement.  
All females of childbearing potential will have a p regnancy test performed at each clinic visit . The 
pregnancy test will have a minimum sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ml for hCG . The results of all 
pregnancy tests (positive or negative) will be documented.  A negative urine pregnancy result must  
be obtained at screening  (Visit 1) before study participation. Subject s with a positive pregnancy 
result  during screening will not be enrolled in the study. Before study enrollment , females  of 
childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation.

Monitoring and Auditing by [CONTACT_68609] G CP and applicable regulations. 
Monitoring visits are for the purpose of  training, confirming adherence to the protocol and to verify 
complete and accurate data collection.  A monitoring plan will be agreed upon between the sponsor 
and the CRO. The Investigator  will be visited by a monitor before  the study, at regular intervals 
during the course of the study and at the completion of the study. Investigator audits will also be  
conducted, the details of which would be described in a separate audit plan . Site Monitoring visits 
and audits (as applicable) will be scheduled with the Investigator  in advance of the visit  at a 
mutually agreed time . 
The study monitor will review the ICFs and verify eCRF entries by [CONTACT_68610]. The monitor will review the maintenance of regulatory documentation and IP 
accountability. The monitor will review the progress of the study  on a regular basis with the 
Investigator  and other site personnel. The clinical site will make all records associated with the 
study available to  representative during such monitoring visits and audits. It is the 
Investigator ’s responsibility to:  
• Provide the monitor with sufficient time to r eview the eCRFs and relevant source 
documents 
• Be available to answer questions , resolve data clarifications  and/or implement corrective 
and preventative actions (as required following a site audit)

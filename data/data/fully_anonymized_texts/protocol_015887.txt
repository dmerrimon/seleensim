As care shifts to home - and community -based settings, multiple forms of consumer health information
technology (IT) are being developed to support patients with their self -management responsibilities. In
particular, remote -monitoring  systems— in which clinically relevant data are captured, analyzed, and
converted into medically relevant information —carry potential for use in multiple chronic diseases that
require constant oversight. This research addresses the need to create and evaluate approaches to self -
management that integrate consumer health IT interventions facilitating continuous monitoring and both
individual and group decision -making.
The purpo
se of this study is to develop and assess a new approach to self -management that recognizes that 
many pat ients with chronic conditions must manage their condition continuously and often do so within a 
social context. Consumer health IT is being advanced that is responsive to the fact that self- management 
rarely occurs in isolation; rather, patients often rely on others including a primary informal caregiver. 
Therefore, there is a need to create a nd evaluate approaches to self- management that integrate consumer 
health IT interventions facilitating continuous monitoring and both individual and group decision -making. This 
proposal seeks to refine and assess such an approach to self- management called CloudConnect , with two 
specific aims: 1) explicate patient and informal caregiver needs and preferences relevant to the technology core of this self -management approach and 2) evaluate the impact of this self -management approach on 
engagement and clinical outcomes.  
The propo
sed research addresses questions that relate to the design and performance of a self- management 
approach for Type [ADDRESS_291682] of two studies associated with this proposal wa s a needs assessment study that reveals  patients’ and 
primary informal caregivers’ needs/preferences for the technology core of Cloud Connect  (UVA IRB-SBS 
#2016 -0273) . This  second study  will implement, a system that aggregates blood glucose values, exercise, 
insulin, and meal information collected from individuals with T1D. This information is then analyzed to determine if there are areas of hypo and hyperglycemic risk and how those risk  zones may relate to physical 
activity and insulin dosing behavior. From that analysis, a report is generated and sent to the adolescents and their parents/guardians on a weekly basis giving them insight into how they can increase their ability to 
control their blood glucose values.  
The res
ults of this project will inform the design information technology that improves engagement and 
clinical outcomes for patients who require continuous monitoring and who engage an informal primary caregiver in self -manag ement outside clinical settings.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Page Number: 2 of 17 Objectives/Hypothesis  
The research project proposed here seeks to assess an approach to self- management called CloudConnect , 
evaluating the impact of CloudConnect on patient engagement, dyad engagement, and clinical outcomes in 
adolescent T1D.  
 
This assessment will address the essential question of how  adolescents  and their parent/guardian  respond to 
this new approach to self- management. This study is designed to assess the impact of a T1D -specific 
CloudConnect implementation  on patient engagement, dyad engagement, and clinical outcomes as well as the 
relationships among these outcome measures for adolescents with diabetes. Through out this protocol, ‘the 
subject’ will refer to the dyad of an adolescent and one parent/ guardian .  
 The randomized controlled trial of CloudConnect is intended to compare the impact of this new model of s elf-
management with  use of their personal insulin parameters with the addition of continuous  glucose monitoring  
(CGM) and Fitbit ,. if not already in use by [CONTACT_1130] . Assessment between the study subject/parent using 
validated surveys and assess clinical outcomes including HbA1c, number of hypoglycemic events, etc. over the 3-month period.  
 Using this approach,  it is expect ed to address the informatics challenge of determining how to design 
information technology that improves engagement and clinical outcomes for patients who require continuous 
monitoring and who engage an informal caregiver in self -management outside clinical settings. Our work 
extends the design of remote -monitoring systems from stationary, home -based systems to wearable devices 
that patients can engage with throughout an active day in the community. Our research team —which consists 
in a biomedical systems engineer, a human factors engineer specialized in consumer health informatics, a 
pediatric endocrinologist, and a pediatrician specialized in clinical research  — works in alliance with the Center 
for Diabetes Technology at the University of Virginia. Study team members have developed this ambulatory 
platform that will be  used as the foundation for this study.  
 Rationale:   The hypothesis  of this study  is that individuals randomized to the CGM/Fitbit with no weekly 
feedback (Control Group)  will improve management modestly initially (as a result of either of new access to 
CGM or the Hawthorne effect of being studied) , but the ir measures of engagement (patient self -management 
behavior (i.e. personal insulin parameters) and diabetes -related dyad communication) will return to baseline 
levels by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_291683] 
(Experimental Gr oup) will have a greater increase in engagement and dyad communication by 8 weeks that is 
sustained by 1 2 weeks  (3 months) .  
 It is further hypothesize that adolescents randomized to CloudConnect will have a lowering of HbA1c that is 
related to the increas e in dyad disease -specific engagement.  Moreover, o ur hypotheses are that this unique 
self-management approach in T1D will increase engagement of adolescents and their informal caregiver 
through increased communication and self -management behavior, and that this increase in engagement will 
lead to improved medical outcomes .  
 These hypotheses are based on data from  preliminary studies collected by [CONTACT_240278]. 
This preliminary data support that parents of adolescents with T1D are eag er to follow their child’s blood

Page Number: 3 of 17 glucose tracing via remote monitoring  — suggesting potential for an increase in involvement with such access 
and increase in disease -related communication. It is well described that an increase in parental involvement in 
diabetes control is associated with better  medical outcomes such as lower HbA1c. Similarly, when adolescents 
exhibit increased degrees of participation in their care (such as a subset of adolescents who regularly used 
their CGM in a large -scale trial), this is associat ed with a lowering of HbA1c .  
 We will test these hypotheses using a randomized trial of CGM/Fitbit with no weekly feedback vs. CGM/Fi tbit 
to CloudConnect. In addition to being compared against each other, both approaches will be compared to degree of engagement and efficacy of diabetes control experienced prior to the intervention, this information 
will be obtained at baseline. This randomized trial of CloudConnect in a chronic disease setting has  been 
designed to assess changes in personal and dyad  engagement and the relationship between this  engagement 
and an important disease outcome.  
 
Study Design: Biomedical  
1.  Will controls be used?  
Yes 
►IF YES, explain the kind of controls to be used.  
The Control Group adolescent subjects will have the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and same 
characteristics as the Experimental Group  adolescent subjects . The Control Group participants will use 
the study CGM , but subjects may elect not to set alarms or use the CGM Apps .  This group will also use 
a study activity tracker  (i.e Fitbit). Control s ubjects will use their personal insulin parameters 
throughout the trial.  Control Group participants will use study insulin pen at mealtime with their  home 
insulin.  Control Group subje cts will download their study equipment and provide it to the study team 
each week. The Control Group will not  receive a weekly CloudConnect Report from the study team. 
Follow up visit in -clinic and phone calls , text messages and or/email  will be the same as the 
Experimental Group .  
 
2. What is the study design?  
This is a randomized control, open -label, single -site clinical trial.  We will target completion by e ighty 
adolscents (age 12 -17 years) with Type 1 diabetes and their parent/guardian (age 18+) to participate in a 3 
month outpatient study. Participants will be r andomized to either a Control Group or Experimental Group. 
Both groups will use the study continuous glucose monitor, study activity tracker, and a study insulin pen if an multi ple daily injection (MDI) user. Subjects who use an insulin pump to treat their type [ADDRESS_291684] Reports. The Control Group will not receive this feedback.  
 
3. Does the study involve a  placebo?

Study  Design:  
This study employs a randomized design in which one group of participants will be assigned to use the 
CloudConnect system and the other group to CGM using their insulin paramenters and treatments.   
 
Study Objectives & Endpoint Definitions:  
As mentioned previously, t his project seeks to assess how  CloudConnect  affects participant  
engagement, dyad engagement, and clinical outcomes in adolescent T1D.  
 
We will assess how adolescents and their parent(s)/guardian(s)  respond to this new approach using the 
Family Communication Inventory  (FCI).  This diabetes -specific approach was designed by [CONTACT_240279] -child communication regarding tasks (discussion of insulin dosing for a 
given meal, BG trends, need for dose changes). As an outcome measure, scores for parents and 
adolescents are summed, with higher scores representing higher degree of engagement and T1D-specific communication . 
 
Power/Precision of the study to address major study endpoints:   
In using the FCI, we determined based o n preliminary data from 220 adolescent/parent participants  
eligible for the study, with mean (90.3) and standard deviation (12.5) that we are  powered to detect a 
difference of 8.5% in this outcome in the treatment group with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.  This 
study will require 40 adolescent participants with 40 parent(s)/guardian(s) to complete per arm. Assuming a non -adherence/drop -out rate of 20 -30% for Intention -to-Treat (ITT) analysis, [ADDRESS_291691] a difference of 8.5% in this outcome in the treatment group with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. This study will require 40 adolescent participants  with 40 parent(s)/guardian(s)  to complete per 
arm. Assuming a non -adherence/ drop -out rate of 20 -30% for Intention- to-Treat (ITT) analysis, 55 participants 
is yielded per arm.  
 
4. What is your plan for primary variable analysis?  
Because this is a randomized study, our primary outcome (score on the Family Communication Inventory) will 
be by t -test comparing those randomized to CloudConnect to usual care+CGM.  Comparison of secondary 
outcomes between treatment groups will also be t -tests.  Secondary analyses of both the primary and 
secondary outcomes will utilize multivariable ANOVA, par ticularly in the event that key variables differ 
between groups.  For example, if average steps per day [as a measure of exercise] is higher in one group vs.

Management  
 
 
Version Date: 05/ 12/2020  
Page Number: 8 of 17 another, this will be used as a variable in the comparison of mean glucose by [CONTACT_240280] a difference in mean glucose once total daily steps was taken into account.  Similarly, if there is an 
imbalance of key participant characteristics among participants who complete the study in one treatment group (such as higher proporti on of multiple -daily -injection participants in the CloudConnect group), this will 
be considered as a variable in the multivariable ANOVA comparing mean glucose by [CONTACT_28047], as a secondary analysis.

their personal insulin and insulin parameters during the trial. The Experimental Group will be trained to use the Study CGM in its full capacity, including setting alarms and using the CGM App that will permit the parent(s)/guardian(s) to receive high or low glycemic value alarms. These subjects will also be trained on the use of the activity tracker (i.e. Fitbit). Experimental Group MDI subjects will be provided and trained on the use of an inPen (Companion Medical, San Diego, CA) for mealtime bolus treatments. Subjects will be asked to provide weekly downloads of all equipment, including the subject’s personal insulin pump. Subjects may be asked to repeat a data collection week if the data provided is insufficient or poor quality. The Experimental Group will receive the additional CloudConnect component consisting of a weekly report based on analysis of 
the data gathered for each participant. After r eview by a study physician, the report will be sent via email once 
a week to both the adolescent participant and their  parent(s)/guardian(s).  
 
Both groups will participate in the same number of visits (completed either in clinic or via phone or video conferencing) and follow up communication contacts done by [CONTACT_112660], text messages and/or emails during 
the entire length of the trial. The production of the CloudConnect Report, in combination with the available Dexcom alarms and apps,  is the study differential between groups.

There are four visits in the Main Study. Visit [ADDRESS_291692] 3 
may be completed by [CONTACT_648]. In addition, there will be weekly communication done by [CONTACT_25600], text 
message and/or email throughout the entire 12 weeks ( 3 months)  of the data collection portion of the study. 
Method of weekly communications with the adolescent  and parent will be based on participant/parent 
preference. The study team will communicate separately with the child and the parent in order to obtain their feedback independent of the other.  
 Subjects will be asked to electronically complete the following questionnaires at the completion of Visit 1 and repeated again at the conclusion of their study participation. Q uestionnaires may be answered remotely (i.e.  
at home) within a week of the visit or during a CRU visit.   
• Blood Glucose Monitoring Communication questionnaire (Hood et al Diab Care 2004)  
• Child and Parental Responsibility Questionnaire (adapted from Anderson et al J. Ped Psychol 1990)  
• Child Self-Management   
• Diabetes Care and Communication  
• Diabetes Family Conflict Scale -Revised (Hood et al Diab Care 2007)  
• Family Communication Inventory

• Questions about CloudConnect use (CloudConnect group only, asked only at study end):  
• On a scale of 1 -7, with 1 being very difficult and 7 being very easy, how easy was it to 
understand the information provided in the weekly reports? Can you tell me why you gave the 
score you did? What could have made the weekly reports easier to understand?  
• On a scale of 1 -7, with 1 being not at all useful and 7 being very useful, how useful were the 
weekly reports in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_240275]/child about managing your/your child’s diabetes? Can you tell me why you gave the score y ou did? What could have made the 
weekly reports more useful to you?  
• Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your experience with the weekly reports ?  
 
The weekly contact [INVESTIGATOR_5774], email or text for both the Control and Experimental Groups wi ll be to:  
• Check for AE or SAE  
• Remind to download all the data (i.e. CGM, insulin pump/insulin pen, Fitbit data)  
• Ask standardized questions , which will include the following : 
o For the child participant:  
 During the past week, did you talk with your parents about your diabetes 
management?  
Yes or No 
 If you answered “yes,” how good or bad was the tone of that conversation?  
(Likert scale: Very good     good     Neutral     bad    Very bad)  
 During the past week, did you change your insulin parameters?  
(Yes=1, No=2)  
o For the adult participant:  
 During the past week, did you talk with your child about his/her diabetes 
management?  
Yes or No 
 If you answered “yes,” how good or bad was the tone of that conversation?  
(Likert scale: Very good     good     Neutral     bad    Very bad)  
 During the past week, did your child  change his/her  insulin parameters?  
 
(Yes=1, No=2)  
Visit 1:  Adolescent s ubjects will be screened as indicated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the consent 
form will be signed electronically after all the question related to the study are answered . The consenting 
process may occur over the phone /video  or in -person. Demographic information and medical history 
information will then be obtained. A physical exam can either  be performed  at Visit 1 or documentati on of a 
physical exam at a physician/provider visit within one year will suffice .  Hemoglo bin A1c will be collected with  
point -of-care equipment  or at a local laboratory . This can be omitted if it is not possible to go to a laboratory 
or come to the clinic  because of governmental restrictions such as Stay -at-Home orders. A urine pregnancy 
test will be required for adolescent  girls who are able to become pregnant.  Test must be negative to 
participate in the study.

collected if visit 1 and 2 are greater than 28 days .  
 Visit 2  (may be combined with Visit 1, may be done via phone or video ):
  Adolescent s ubjects will be 
randomized and trained on the use  of the study  CGM and Fitbit . The CGM will be inserted into their abdomen 
per manufacturer instructions. Both Control and Experimental Group subjects will use their own personal 
pump. If the subject use s multiple daily injections  (MDI), a commercialy available Bluetooth connected insulin 
pen (inPen) will be given to both the Control and Experimental subjects in order to be able to collect the data 
accurately  about meal time bolus treatments . Both pump users and MDI subjects will use their personal 
insulin. Each group will provide the study team weekly downloads from the study equipment and the personal 
insulin pump . Weekly CloudConnect reports will be provided to the Experimental Group participants  only .  
 Depending on the subjects/family preference, the study team contact [CONTACT_240283], text messages and/or emails at least once a week during the trial to:   
a) Remind them to download and transmit the data  
b) Check for AEs or SAEs  
c) Ask weekly standardized questions  
All subjects will be reminded  on how to download study data , if necessary . Both groups may complete a 1-
week  run-in period if they are CGM- naïve to ensure they are comfortable with the use of the study 
equipment, that all the study devices work properly , and to address issues related to transmission of the data 
to the study team . This run- in period may be repeated as necessary up to [ADDRESS_291694] CGM experience, the investigator  will determine if it is appropriate for he or she to skip the run- in 
period.  
 Visit 3  Check -in (Week 8 / on -site, email,  or phone) :
  
Subjects will download diabetes equipment weekly and submit the data to the study team for 12 weeks. Subjects may be asked to repeat a week of data collection if the quality of the data is insufficient for analysis.   
 A Check -In with the adolescent and pa rent/guardian will be completed to evaluate compliance  and to answer 
any questions that the adolescent or parent may have about the study.  
 Visit 4  – End of Study  (about Week 12 ):
 Subject s will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) to 
retu rn study equipment  (i.e. Bluetooth pen, CGM, Fitbit) , if possible .  A post -study HbA1c test will be obtained 
with a point -of-care equipment  or local laboratory  (same method as screening collection) .  This can be 
omitted if it is not possible to go to a laboratory or come to the clinic because of governmental restrictions such as Stay -at-Home orders.  Questionnaires will be completed electronically at the end of this visit . 
Questionnaires may be completed at home prior to this visit  or at the CRU.  
 
2. If this protocol involves study treatment, explain how a subject will be transitioned from study treatment when they have completed their participation in the study.   
The study intervention is to evaluate th e communication between the adolescent study subjects and their 
parents. The treatment for T1D is subcutaneous insulin either by [CONTACT_240284]. This

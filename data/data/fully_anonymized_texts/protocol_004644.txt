 INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background Information 
Patients with chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_450231] (COPD) [1], Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS)  [2], 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)  [3] or Neuromuscular D isease  (NMD)  [4, 5] are increasingly managed 
with d omiciliary non-invasive positive pressure vent ilation (NIPPV) [ 1, 6-8]. 
Optimal settings of non -invasive ventilation are usually titrated manually and require time and 
expertise [ 9]. One such setting is expi[INVESTIGATOR_51374] (EPAP) which is used to manage 
the lower airway and, if needed, prevent upper airway obstruction (UAO). In order to o ptimal ly 
adjust a fixed EPAP setting  in a NIP PV device , a sleep study  is usually required where respi[INVESTIGATOR_450232] [ 10]. The waiting time for NIPPV  titration s leep 
studies can be lengthy and/or be  poorly performed due to resource limitations, and once they are, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_450233]. In the instances where respi[INVESTIGATOR_450234] s are recorded and analyzed, optimization  of fixed EPAP settings are only based on the 
patient’s condition for that single night. As a result, single night titrations may not capture significant 
alterations in factors which may affect the level of EPAP required, such as posture [11] and s leep 
state (e.g. supi[INVESTIGATOR_450235])  [12]. 
Additionally, patient requirements may change over time due to  progression of their chronic illness,  
weight fluctuations  and prescribed medications , and, in some patients, changes in tissue edema 
location and severity with posture changes  [13]. As such, the EPAP pressures, which are all under 
clinician control, are  set during a titration  study  and must be high enough to deal with the worst 
conditions which may occur during the night. Clinicians must also regularly monitor patients, and 
possible perform re-titrations to make sure the manually set EPAP is optimal.  
For all these reasons, an automatic adjustable  EPAP (i.e. “ AutoEPAP ”) with clinician controlled 
minimum and maximum EPAP levels, may offer advantages over a fixed EPAP  for managing UAO.  
While an Auto EPAP algorithm  could be used in the context of  conventional fixed pressure support 
bilevel therapy  (e.g. Spontaneous/Time (ST) mode), it  would be useful  to be used with a therapy 
mode which aims to automate  all other aspects of ventilation as much as possible. Similar 
automated techniques have been successfully developed and established in current practice for 
OSA  and periodic breathing [ 14, 15].  
The Astral ventilator includes the Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support ( iVAPS) (ResMed, 
Sydney, Australia , K152068) mode - a pressure support servoventilator which automatically adjusts 
pressure support to achieve a target alveolar ventilation (minute ventilation minus the anatomical 
deadspace) for patients who require mechanical continuous or intermittent ventilation. The amo unt 
of anatomical deadspace  is calculated from an algorithm based on patient height. iVAPS  also has a 
variable respi[INVESTIGATOR_450236]  (i.e. Intelligent breathing rate; iBR) , in which the set backup rate is 
delivered during periods of hypoventilation or ce ntral a pnea  only. When the user is breathing 
spontaneously and is triggering the device, the iBR algorithm will decrease the  backup rate down to 
2/3 of the ‘ target breath rate ’. When necessary, iBR will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_450237] ‘target breath rate’  to achieve target alveolar ventilation . The ‘Target breath rate’ is set 
according to the user’s spontaneous breath rate during quiet wakefulness or in accordance with clinical needs (i.e. optimal PaO
2 and PaCO 2). The ‘Target breath ra te’ can be  measured  and set  by 
[CONTACT_450261], or manually adjusted by [CONTACT_15370].  Clinical trials evaluating a VAPS  mode 
have been performed  and have demonstrated VAPS is equivalent in treating respi[INVESTIGATOR_450238] [ 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 
23]. 
Astral  VAPS AutoEPAP Clinical Trial  (MA -15-12-15)   Version 4.0, 06.June .[ADDRESS_573804] obstruction. These patients therefore  
may  benefit from NIPPV  therapy  which incorporates the management of volume assurance 
pressure support (i.e. VAPS) and UAO (i.e. Auto EPAP ).  
One such algorithm which has been developed is the iVAPS  AutoEPAP  algorithm ( ResMed, Sydney, 
Australia ). The iVAPS  AutoEPAP  algorithm h as been previously trialed in patients with  respi[INVESTIGATOR_450239] ( OHS ), Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) or neuromuscular disease (NMD) [24]. The patients completed two sleep 
studies  (PSG ) with iVAPS: one a manually titrat ed EPAP , and a second sleep study to observe and 
record the EPAP pressure generated from the AutoEPAP algorithm. Results showed that the 
algorithm was able to automatically titrate  the EPAP level to effectively treat UAO  in conjunction 
with respi[INVESTIGATOR_450240] a fixed EPAP  pressure. 
Treatment of UAO was shown to be comparable between the manually titrated EPAP  with iVAPS, 
versus iVAPS  AutoEPAP  (mean AHI  1.7 (2.8)  hr-1 and 1.3 (2.3) hr -1, respectively; p = 0.52) [24]. 
The aim of this study is to now c ompare the AutoEPAP  algorithm with   manual EPAP in iVAPS mode 
on an Astral ventilator. It is proposed that the automatic settings of  AutoEPAP  will be as effective 
at managing respi[INVESTIGATOR_450241] . Specifically 
demonstrating that the AutoEPAP function is as effective at treating UAO as manual EPAP.  
Astral is a homecare and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450242]. While total flow might be measured at the outlet of the Astral ventilator, this flow would include uncompensated components of flow from the mask vent and unintentional mask leak that will vary both within the breath due to varying pressure and over a longer time course due to changing mask leak. Based on the offset 
and variation of these components, accurate measurement of apneas and hypopneas would not be possible. 
Since it is not technically feasible to calculate AHI, a surrogate for AHI is the ODI4% based on pulse oximetry that can be accurately obtained with PSG systems whilst a patient is using the Astral ventilator. 
Clinically, ODI4% correlates exceptionally well with the AASM 2007 scoring rules for AHI (r = 0.98) 
[25]. See figure 1.

Secondary aims include assessing the other potential physiological (i.e. sleep and sleep- breathing 
variables and gas exchange ) that  the algorithm may have on the patient.  
4.2. Intended Use  
The Astral device provides continuous or intermittent ventilatory support for patients who require 
mechanical continuous or intermittent ventilation ( ResMed, Sydney, Australia, K152068). 
Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support ( iVAPS) is a mode of therapy for patients who require 
mechanical ventilation. The Astral device with the AutoEPAP algorithm and manual EPAP in iVAPS 
mode will be used in this protocol . 
 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
5.1. Primary Objective  
The primary outcome is the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI4% ). The primary aim of this protocol 
is to compare ODI values following the use of the  AutoEPAP algorithm in comparison to  manual  
EPAP  on the Astral ventilator . 
5.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives will be used to determine if the AutoEPAP algorithm remains effective in 
treating respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  
1. To assess the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) as measured by  [CONTACT_450260]. 
2. To assess sleep-breathing parameters (e.g. nadir SpO 2 and PtCO2) wi th AutoEPAP algorithm 
compared to manual EPAP on an Astral device.  
3. To assess sleep parameters (e.g. sleep efficacy and arousal index) with AutoEPAP algorithm compared to manual EPAP on an Astral device.

 STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a prospective, multi -center, single -blind, randomi zed, cross-over design. The study will occur 
in a lab/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] . This study will be conducted at several centers in the [LOCATION_002] . 
6.1. Enrollment  
Subjects will be recruited from pulmonary clinics at each site.  
6.2. Selection of Subjects  
6.2.1.  Informed Consent 
The consent form is written in accordance with applicable data privacy acts and FDA 
Regulations and approved by [CONTACT_450262] (IRB ). 
The investigator or responsible staff will explain the nature, purpose and risks associated with the study. The patient will be given sufficient time to consider the study’s implications 
before deciding whether to participate. Information materials created  by [CONTACT_450263].  
A signed, IRB -approved consent form must be obtained from the patient prior to the 
performance of any protocol -related testing or treatment procedures. The consent 
process must be performed by a designated clinical study team member authorized by [CONTACT_450264]. A signed copy of the consent form must be maintained in the study 
files and a copy provided to the patient. The patient’s permanent medical records should indicate study participation.  
6.2.2.  Study Population and Randomization 
Enrolled subjects  will be representative of patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_450243](s) are considered as potential candidates for randomization into the study. 
After verification of the subject's eligibility for the study, the study coordinator will assign 
the subject to 1 of 2 arms of the study, using the computer -generated randomization 
schedule provided by [CONTACT_1034]. 
This is a single-blind study. This means that the subjects will be blinded to the 
randomization group that they are assigned  to; the site Investigator and site study staff 
will know which randomization group the subject has been assigned to . The scorer(s) of 
the PSG will be blinded to which therapy is being used for objective determination of the primary and secondary endpoints .  
6.2.3.  Number of Subjects  
Up to a total of 40 subjects will be enrolled across all centers.  
6.2.4.  Sample Size Justification  
This study is powered for demonstrating ODI4%  non-inferiority between the AutoEPAP 
algor ithm and  manual  EPAP  algorithm  on the Astral device . 
Astral  VAPS AutoEPAP Clinical Trial  (MA -15-12-15)   Version 4.0, 06.June .2016

ResMed Confidential  This protocol  has been  powered with the following inputs based on a previous study [2 6]. 
Expected mean difference in ODI: [ADDRESS_573805] deviation in ODI: 1.55  
Power = 80%  
Alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_573806]:  
n = (Z α + Zβ)2 × (SD/difference)2 = 22.84 = [ADDRESS_573807] (one in which the outcome 
is dependent) we can be 95% sure that a sample size of [ADDRESS_573808] to difference of ODI. 
 
The update to this protocol (v3.0 to v4.0) was completed to be consistent with the recent 
FDA clearance of Astral with iVAPS. The increase in enrollment goal will provide additional 
power (95%) to detect a difference between AutoEPAP and manual EPAP.  
 
We pre -specify a non-inferiority margin for ODI4% of 2 per h our (refer to Section 12) . 
Basing the sample size on being able to detect the smallest difference in ODI  (1 per hour) 
will pro vide greater power, through a larger sample size, in testing the non -inferiority 
margin (2 per hour).

The Astral device will deliver positive airflow to the patient via approved tubing and a vented mask. The device will therefore only come into direct contact [CONTACT_450265], primarily the hands, during movement, setup, or adjustment of the device.  
For the purpose of this clinical trial, user and clinical guides (Appendix A ) will be provided with the 
devices to the clinicians and participants which will include iVAPS AutoEPAP specifications.  
The iVAPS AutoEPAP algorithm is currently not approved by [CONTACT_1622], and is therefore considered an Unapproved Medical Device.  
7.2. Device Accountability  
An accu rate and current accounting of the dispensing of ResMed devices ( Astral ) will be maintained 
on an on- going basis by a qualified member of the study site using the Sponsor-provided “Device 
Disposition Log”. The serial number unique to each Astral device wil l be documented on this Log. 
Devices will be made available to the investigator by [CONTACT_275712]. If a replacement device is dispensed, it will be documented per device accountability procedure. All non-disposable ResMed devices must be returned to ResMed at the end of the study.  
7.3. Labeling  
The label contains the information as required by [CONTACT_275713]:  
a) Sponsor name [CONTACT_3816]  
b) Serial number to identify the individual device  
c) Instruction For Use  
7.4. Packaging 
The Astral device is  FDA 510(k) cleared ( K152068) and will be used with the standard packaging. 
“Investigational Use Only” stickers will be placed on all study devices prior to sending to study sites. 
7.5. Instruction for Use  
The devices will be used as specified in the relevant I nstructions for Use provided by [CONTACT_450266].

 THERAPY  
8.1. Treatment with Astral device  
During this study, the Astral device will be used in a clinic setting during monitored PSG testing. AutoEPAP and manual EPAP will be used in iVAPS mode for this study . 
8.2. Set up of Astral device 
For initiation of therapy,  for subjects in either arm of the study,  the Astral device will be set wit h 
clinically appropriate settings, as determined by [CONTACT_450268].  These 
settings include: target volume and minimum and maximum pressure support (PS). For subjects 
randomized to the manual  EPAP group on Visit 2, the EPAP setting s will be based on the subject’s 
previous titrated settings.  For subjects randomized to the AutoEPAP group on Visit 2, the minimum 
and maximum AutoEPAP settings will be set to default, or as clinically appropriate. Additional details 
and instructions will  be included in the study Manual of Procedures.

  STUDY TIMELINE  
The investigators estimate it will take up to 16 weeks to recruit a total of 40 parti cipants  from all US sites.  
Astral  VAPS AutoEPAP Clinical Trial  (MA -15-12-15)   Version 4.0, 06.June .2016 
Page 21 of 30 
ResMed Confidential  Each participant is to attend 2 -3 visits to the site (Visit 1 and 2 may be combined). Visits 2 and 3  will be 
overnight visits at the site’s sleep unit. Ideally, sleep studies will occur on [ADDRESS_573814]. Should this occur, all participants currently participating in the trial will be notified, will be withdrawn safely 
from the study, and will resume their usual NIPPV  therapy. 
 SAFETY  
The investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects enrolled into the study at the study site. The investigator or qualified designee will enter the required initial and follow -up information 
regarding adverse events on the appropriate eCRF within the EDC system. Investigators are responsible 
for following all serious adverse events (SAEs) until resolution, stabilization, or the event is  otherwise 
explained, and to report serious adverse events as well as serious injury or death that were related to 
(caused by [CONTACT_275715]) the Astral study device in accordance with their local IRB requirements. Investigators should follow usual clin ical practice at their institutions for reporting serious events to the 
regulatory authorities.  
11.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
11.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medical product and which not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
11.1.2.  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or  associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safet y, or welfare of subjects.  
11.1.3.  Serious Adverse Effect (event or reaction) (SAE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(voluntary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_450249])  
• results in persistent (symptomatic or moderate) or significant disability /incapacity  
• an important medical event; or  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Data recorded during ‘Ramp’ time (i.e. the time taken for the pressures to increase to the prescribed 
settings when the device is first turned on) will be e xcluded. Data will be checked for normality. If the 
data is normally distributed, descriptive data will be presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), and marginal differences. Comparisons between the two modes will be done using paired T -test.  
If the data is not normally distributed, descriptive data will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Comparative analysis between  AutoEPAP and  manual EPAP  will be performed using the 
Mann -Whitney U test.  
A p < 0.05 will be considered significant ly different between  AutoEPAP and manual EPAP  if: 1. there is 
no significant difference between  AutoEPAP and manual EPAP  or 2.  AutoEPAP is significantly better 
than manual EPAP , than the null hypothesis will be rejected and the AutoEPAP algorithm will be  
considered as ‘passed’ .  
We pre -specify a non -inferi ority margin for ODI4% of [ADDRESS_573815] for non -
inferiority as:  
Non-inferiority margin for ODI: d=2  
H0: μ
A – μB ≤ -d (new algorithm is inferior)  
H1: μA – μB > -d (new algorithm is non -inferior)  
 
To show non -inferiority the lower bound of the 95th confidence interval of the difference between the 
groups must not cross the margin boundary (ODI4% of 2 per hour).  
Which will be tested with a single-sided t-test with an alpha  of 0.05 and a power of 80%.  This pre-
specified non -inferiority margin for ODI4% of 2 per hour is considered clinically unimportant, is the 
same margin as used in a previous study [26], and 2 per hour represents approximately 7% of severe 
UAO (30 per hour) . 
We also pre-specify that we will reject subjects where the ODI4% cannot be controlled during the control arm  phase  ( manual EPAP). This is defined as an  ODI ≥ 10 per hour. This process will be 
documented in the study Manual of Procedures and training pro vided for all participating sites. 
12.1. Withdrawal of Subjects  
Due to factors not able to be predicted prior to the commencement of clinical studies , participants may 
at times either “drop-out” or withdraw from the study by [CONTACT_450270], or be withdrawn from the 
study by [CONTACT_76617]. Data from participants who are excluded, drop -out or withdraw 
from the study prior to study completion will be collected until the point of study discontinuation, unless the participant explicitly withdraws his/her data. Where participants formally revoke their consent, 
which includes the revocation of consent for any data collection, all data collected from these 
participants will not be used in any data analyses.

possible, all enrolled participants’ remaining collected data will still be included in the final data set for 
analysis on the condition that the participant has completed all required study-r elated procedures. 
Enrolment is considered as taking place at the point of randomization . 
 DATA MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE  
13.1. Data Collection  
All raw data from the study will be non -identified format and documented on:  
• CRF’s (Appendix C)  
• Sleep study reports (which  details sleep and respi[INVESTIGATOR_450252])  
• Flash drives  from the devices.   
13.2. Study Documentation 
Throughout the conduct of the study, all required data will be entered into the eCRF for each 
subject. The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data 
reported to the Sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required reports an d will be asked to sign and date 
the appropriate eCRF page(s) to verify the data collected. Data entered into the eCRF must be 
consistent with source documents. Any change or correction to an eCRF will be captured in the EDC 
system audit trail.  
The clinic al site will provide study data to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_450271] (21 CFR 
Part 11 compliant).  
In cases of subject -reported data, the eCRF will be the source record.   
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_450253] e CRFs for accuracy, 
discrepancies, and missing information. The information entered into the eCRF will be accessible to 
the appropriate ResMed Medical Affairs personnel.  
13.3. Query Generation 
Any data queries will be sent to site for reconciliation via the eCRF system and final close -out will 
be from the study monitor. 
13.4. Data  Storage 
All electronic systems used by [CONTACT_450272]. All paper documentation will be locked in a secured cupboard. All trial 
data and documentation will be retained for a minimum of 15 years before it is destroyed. Access to data maintained in the EDC System is strictly limited to authorized personnel.  
13.5. Inspection of Records  
Periodically the Sponsor or representative will review the Investigator study file and the study data to verify compliance with applicable regulations and the protocol, and to verify accuracy of 
the data.

of the study to be fully documented and the study data to subsequently be verified. These documents should be  classified into two separate categories: (1) investigator’s study file and (2) 
subject clinical source documents.  
Essential documents must be retained until at least [ADDRESS_573817] be provided to the Sponsor prior to study initiation are:  
• Signed, dated current (within 2 years) curriculum vitae of Investigator and Sub -
Investigator(s)  
• Financial disclosure for physicians and nurses  
• Signed (original), dated Investigator Agreement  
• Assurance that the IRB complies with requirements set forth in Title [ADDRESS_573818].  
• Written notification (copy) to the Investigator from the IRB approving the protocol  
• IRB approved informed consent (copy) and any other adjunctive materials to be used in th e 
study as required.  
13.8. Distribution of Results  
Data analyses will be completed by [CONTACT_450273].  
Any published and presented data will be non -identifiable .  
 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
The investigator must have written and dated approval from the IRB for the protocol, consent 
form, subject recruitment materials/process (advertisements), and any other written information 
to be provided to subjects. The investigator should also provide the IRB with a copy of the product 
labeling information and any updates. The investigator will provide the IRB with reports, updates, and other information (e.g., safety updates and protocol amendments) as required by [CONTACT_381486].  
14.2. Protocol Deviations  
An investigator is required to conduct this study in accordance with the signed Investigator's Agreement, this Investigational Plan, applicable laws and FDA regulations, and any conditions of 
approval imposed by [CONTACT_32484]. According to FDA regulation 21 CFR § 
812.150(a)(4), an investigator shall notify the sponsor and the reviewing IRB of any deviation from 
Astral  VAPS AutoEPAP Clinical Trial  (MA -15-12-15)   Version 4.0, 06.June .[ADDRESS_573819] the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects, FDA and IRB approval may also be 
required in accordance with 21 CFR § 812.35(a).  
14.3. Risk Analysis  
14.3.1.  Non -Significant Risk Determination  
The Astral device  with the iVAPS  algorithm has been cleared ( K152068) by [CONTACT_450274]. The device is 
intended for home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a new algorithm that auto titrates EPAP to treat patients with UAO and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] .  
Clinical personnel will observe the subject on the fitting and use of all Astral devices. They will 
monitor the subject’s clinical parameters and will intervene, if required.  
As per FDA good practice guidelines (21 CFR 10.115), this study protocol as well as the Astral device  
was assessed for risk to participants. A s this study does not meet the definition of significant risk as 
defined by 21 CFR 812.3(m), the investigative team has determined that this protocol and the Astral device is non -significant risk.    All subjects will maintain all other therapy regimens pe r standard 
clinical care; this protocol does not dictate any other adjustments to the participants’ care regimen 
and there are no protocol -required assessments or procedures that pose significant risk to the 
participants.  As required by [CONTACT_1622], the IRB(s)  will review this study protocol and make the final 
determination of NSR designation.  
Subjects should be encouraged to discuss any issues they are having with therapy during the study. 
The investigator should assess for changes in the health or well -being of the subject in response to 
general, non -directed questioning (e.g., “How are you feeling while using the therapy?”).   Side 
effects should be documented on the site’s source documents. Any transient side effects, at a minimum, should be documented in the clinic record.  
Furthermore, if during the evaluation the subject believes the mask or therapy is intolerable, the study staff will be instructed to discontinue use of the protocol device on the patient and ensure 
the patient returns to using their current mask and therapy. Potential expected adverse events are 
believed to be mild and similar to other commercially available mask systems.  
Participants will be asked to  use the study device only during the two study visits that are fully 
attended PSG nights in a sleep lab.  The attending technicians have experience setting up the eligible patient population in this study.  All subjects return to their current NIPPV therapy after completing the study visits . 
As the trial involves a minimally tested algorithm for the treatment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] , there is a 
small chance that treatment will be ineffective and will result in a maximum of one night with suboptimal therapy. This may result in a temporary increa se in the participant’s CO
2 levels causing 
dyspnea, tachypnea, flushing, and/or sweating. This is being mitigated in two ways:  
Astral  VAPS AutoEPAP Clinical Trial  (MA -15-12-15)   Version 4.0, 06.June .2016 
Page 26 of 30 
ResMed Confidential  1. Trained study staff are able to stop the study and resume normal treatment at any time if 
they feel the patient requires more eff ective treatment.  
2. Participants' oxygen and carbon dioxide levels will be monitored overnight using oximetry and transcutaneous CO
2 monitoring  equipment (as per routine practice), to ensure further 
medical treatment is not required for hypoxia or hypercapnia.  
Potential expected adverse events are believed to be mild and similar to other commercially available 
NIPPV systems. The antici pated  adverse effects during this trial are minimal and limited to those 
recognized with standard use of NIPPV  treatment. These include:  
• drying of the nose, mouth, or throat  
• nosebleed 
• bloating  
• ear or sinus discomfort  
• eye irritation  
• skin rashes on the face from the mask  
Eligible patients will already be established on NIPPV  treatment (ST or VAPS mode). It is expected 
that any anticipated adverse events linked to AutoEPAP  in iVAPS mode will be similar to ST or VAPS 
modes. 
14.3.2.  Subject Data Confidentiality  
All information and data collected for this study protocol concerning subjects or their participation 
in this investigation will be considered confidential. Only authorized Sponsor personnel or a Sponsor 
representative will have access to these confidential files. All data will be handled in accordance with 
applicable local laws. Authorized FDA personnel or Regulatory Authorities have the right to inspect 
and copy all records pertinent to this investigation. All data used in the analysis and reporting of this investigation will be without identifiable reference to specific subject name.  
 QUALITY  
Quality Control is defined as the operational techniques and activities, such as monitoring, undertaken within the quality assurance system to verify that the requirement s for quality of the study related 
activities have been fulfilled.  
Quality Control should be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed correctly.  
15.1. Site Selection  
The sites should have previously participated in clinical studies and must have adequate experience, 
time, staff, and facilities to perform all required duties. Sites must permit clinical trial related 
monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source 
data/documents, as appropriate  
15.2. PSG Data  
This study will utilize a sleep core lab to ensure consistency in scoring across all participants and all sites.  The sleep core lab member responsible for scoring the participant PSGs will be blinded to the 
subject’s randomization group as well as to the therapy settings of the participant . It is the 
responsibility of the site investigator to collect and send this data to the sleep core lab.

the initiation meeting, experienced site personnel must train new employees as noted above and 
document the training (contact [CONTACT_450275]).  
15.4. Site Monitoring  
The study will be initiated by [CONTACT_11200], or designee, during an on -site visit after all required 
documents have been processed. Qualified clinical monitors will perform on -site monitoring visits 
as frequently as is deemed necessary.  
During the site visits, the monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRF with the source documents. In addition, the monitor will verify that standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are being followed. Findings from the review of  eCRFs, source documents and study conduct will be 
discussed with the investigator. The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the study coordinator and investigator will be available, the source documentation will be available and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study related documents

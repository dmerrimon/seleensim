double-blind. placeb o-controlled. parallel group sLudy Lo evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of AMG 714 for the treatme nt or adult patients with 
RCD-11. 
After signing consent subjects will be screened for the study. All 
subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized at a 2: I 
ratio to receive either 8 mg/ kg A MG 714 or placebo a total of 7 times 
over I 0 weeks, with evaluation of the primary endpo int at Week 12.

Subjects will be expected to maintain total adhe rence to a strict gluten-
free diet (GFD) from 6 month s before randomization through the final 
study visit (Visit 9, Week I 6/Day 112). Subject's adherence to GFD 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_752444] (GIP) stool

Subjects will return to the clinic for the next administration of study 
drug after I week (Visit 2. Week I/Day 7). After Visit 2. subject s will 
return to the clinic for follow-up and study drug administration at Visit 
3 (Week 2/Day 14) and every two weeks thereafter as indicated in the 
study schedule of events (Table I). The final study dose will be 
admi nistered at Visit 7 (Week IO /D ay 70). An end-or- study efficacy 
visit will be conducted at Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 84). The tinal study 
visit will be conducted [ADDRESS_1030229] dose of study drug at Visit

Subjects enrolled in the study will complete the BSFS at the time or 
each bowel movement from baseli ne (Visit I; Week O /Day 0) up to the 
final study vis it, Visit 9 (Week 16/Day 112). Subjects will complete the 
CeD PRO daily from baseline to the final study visit. Subjects will also 
complete the GSRS beginning at Visit I (Week O /Day 0) and, thereaft er, 
\ eekly from the time of randomiza tion through the final study visit. 
The BSFS. GSRS and the daily CeD PRO will be completed using a 
handh eld electronic diary. In addition , subjects will complete pape r 
quality of life diaries (SF-12 v. 2. EQ-S D and PtGA). Diaries will he 
completed at the times specified in the Schedule of Events (Table I). 
Random ization and initial dosing of the first ten s ubject s will be 
staggered, with no more than two subjects sta rting dosing per week. and 
avoiding the initiation of more than one patient on any single day. 
Safety will be monito red on an ongoing basis and subjects may undergo 
unscheduled visits for safety reasons, if needed. Safety will be assessed 
througho ut the studv bv clinical laboratory t ests, physical examination, 
Protoco l CELIM -RCD-[ADDRESS_1030230] (DSMB) will

1.l BACKGRO UND 
The disease to be treat ed is Refractory Celiac Disease Type II (RCD- 11). an in situ small bov cl 
T cell lymph oma. RCD- 11 appears in ~0.5% of pa tients with celiac disease and has -50% 
probability o f progression to a syste mic Enteropath y-Associated T cell Lymp homa (EATL). 
The treatment-resi stant EA TL has dismal prognosis with <20% surviva l at 5 years. 
Cclimmun e is al so investigating AMG 714 for the treatmen t of diet non-re sponsive celiac 
disease (NRCD ). NRCD and RCD-[ADDRESS_1030255] pathoph ysiological role in each 
of these diseases . respo nsible for mucosal dama ge in N RCD and for aberrant IEL proliferation 
in RCD-11. 
For the sake of provid ing a comprehen sive background. we describe the presumed responsib le 
mediator (IL- 15). the precursor condition (celiac disease) and. linall y. the specific disease to 
be treated (RCD- IT, the in situ small bowe l T cell lymph oma). 
1.1.1 IL-15 
Interleukin 15 (IL-15), a glycoprotein of approximately 14-15 kDa, is a proinflamm atory 
cytokine with structur al s imilarities to IL-2. IL-15 exerts biological effec ts on man y 
immun o logically relevam cells (Fehniger and Caligiuri. 200 I). While important differe nces. 
discussed below, are pr esent across species. I L-15 generally acts as a development. 
hom eostasis and activat ion factor for NK cells and m emory phenoty pe CDS+ T cells, and it 
induc es the production o f c hemokines and cytokines by [CONTACT_752451]. I L-15 potently 
stimulate s the production of proinflammat ory cytokines such as I L-1, I L-6, and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TN F-a) by [CONTACT_51920] /macrophages. IL-1 5 produced by [CONTACT_752452] r dendriti c cells 
is reported lo support genninal center B cell prolifer ation and immun oglobulin class switchin g 
(Park el al, 2004; Litin skiy et al. 2002). Targeted disrupti on of either the IL- 15 or the IL- 15 
receptor alpha (IL-1 5Ra) genes in mice has been sh own to result in the loss o f N K. N K- T. 
TCRy8 + intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_752394], and mem ory CD8+ cells (Lodolce el al. 1998). In I L-15 
knockout mice. these defects are r eversible by [CONTACT_752453] o f exogenous I L-15 
(Kenn edy et al, 2000). In contrasL human NK cells are not entirely depend ent on JL-15 (Lebrcc 
el al, 2013 ). 
I L-15 messenger RNA (mRNA ) is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell type s. 
However. expression of I L-[ADDRESS_1030256]-
transeriptional control m echanism s. Immun ologically relevant sources of I L-15 protein include 
mon ocyte s, macrophag es, epi[INVESTIGATOR_752395], and bone ma rrow stromal cells 
(Fehniger and Caligiuri , 200 I). IL-15 and its recepto r are also expressed in some or gans 
outside the immune system; the role of I L-15 in these systems is less well understood. The 
absence of any overt defects outside the immun e system in IL-15 and IL-15 Ra knockout mice 
suggests that I L-15 may not be essential in any o ther system. 
Protocol CELIM-ROC -002 
Vers ion 3, 11-J L-2016 
Page 27 of 13.S Confi dential 
I L-15 binds to a hcterotrimcric receptor that cons ists of a p chain that is shared with the I L-2 
receptor (CDl22 or IL-2/IL-15Rf3). the common y chain (yC). shared with the IL-2. -4. -7. -9. 
and -2 1 receptors. and a unique a chain. IL-15 binds with high affin ity to the JL-ISRa chain, 
which then interacts with the I L-2/1 L-1 SRB and the yC. The assoc iation of the I L-15/1 L-15 Ru 
complex with the other two components of the comp lete receptor comple x can occur in a cis 
configura tion where all three receptor component s are present on the same eel I, or in a trans 
configuration where the IL I Sill I 5Ra pair i on one cell and the receptor P and yC chains are 
on another (Schluns et al. 2005 ). I L-15 can also associate with IL-15R a on the cell surface and 
then be cl eaved into soluble cytokine /receptor complexes that have the potenti al to stimulat e 
CD8+ T cells and NK cells (Anthony et al. 2015). 
Increased expre ssion of IL-15 has been demons trated in a variety of innammatory conditi ons. 
includin g rheumat oid arthritis (RA}. psoriasis, inflammato ry bowel disease, graft-ver sus-host 
disease. solid organ transplant rejection (Blaser el al. 2005; Conti et al. 2003 : Gianfrani et al. 
1005; Mcinnes and Gracie. 2004 ) and celiac disease (reviewed in Gianfrani et al. 2005: 
Meressc et al, 2012). 
1.2 CEL IAC DJSEASE 
Celiac disease is a systemic autoimmune disease trigg ered by [CONTACT_752454] s (Green and Celli er, 2007) . Currently appro ximate ly I% of 
the western populat ion is affected by [CONTACT_752455], albeit the vast majority of patients remain 
undiagnosed . T he prevalence is rwi ce that in coun tries with very high hygiene s tandard s and/or 
very high gluten consumpti on. Presently it is estimated that 15-20 milli on patients are affecte d

Gluten, the antig en respons ible for celiac disease. is the main protein present in some of the 
most common cereals (wheat, barley. rye). Mod ern diets are increa singly enriched with gluten 
and it is a lso used as an addi tive in processed foods , cosmetics and oral medicati ons. Gluten is 
the seco nd most common food ingredient after sugar and, in some coun tries, is present in up

auto-antibodies appear as a hallmark of the celiac autoimmune process and are used in 
accurate ly diagn osing the disease (Green and Cellier. 2007). 
The only currently available strateg y for the manageme nt of celiac disease patients is a lifelong 
total avoidance of gluten. While simple in theory. the ubiquity of gluten make s total avoidance 
of gluten very difficult -if not impo ssible in practice. As little as 50 mg/day (a normal diet 
contains> I 0 gr/day) triggers activation of the T cells of the smal I bowel and cause intestinal 
muco sa! dama ge (Cata ssi el al, 2007). A study by [CONTACT_752462] (2014) found the burden ofcel iac 
disease and a Gl7D on patient qualit y of life was ranked second only to end-stage renal disease 
- a debi litating and life-threaten ing cond ition that requires polypharmacy and multiple, week ly 
dialysis treatment s. For these reasons. celiac patient s are unable to comply with a zero gluten 
diet, and more than 50% of diagno sed patient s on a GFD continue to present active disease and 
intestinal immun e activation and mucosa! atrophy (Lee et al, 2003; Cranney et al. 2007 : 
Hopper et al, 2007; Midhagen et al 2003). Celiac patients who continue to have symptoms 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_752396] a GFD are deemed to have diet ·'non-r espons ive celiac disease·· 
or NRCO. NRCD has been defined as "persistent symptoms , signs or laboratory abnomialities 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_752397] 6-12 month s of dietary gl uten avoidance" (Rub io-Tapi a et al, 
2013). Morta lity is increase d in subjects with persistent intestinal mucosal dama ge 
(Ludvigsson et al. 2009). 
1.2.1 Refractory Celiac Disease 
A rare but specific complication of persistent diet non-responsive celiac disease is the 
development of Refrac tory Celiac Disea se (RCD). which aITecl s approximately I% of celiac 
patients (Lebwohl el al, 2013) and is characteri zed by [CONTACT_752463] s in the 
absence of gluten consumpt ion and in the presence of small bowel aberrant imraepi[INVESTIGATOR_752398] (lELs) (reviewed in Verbeck et al 2008, and in van Wanrooij et al. 2014). 
Refractory Cel iac Disease patients can be further classified accordin g to the number of aberrant 
lELs. Patients with low numbers of aberrant IELs, defined as less than 20 % of total IELs. as 
determi ned by [CONTACT_752464]. are referred to as having Type I RCD (RC D-1). and are not at 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_752399]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_752400]. otherwise referred to as 
enteropathy-assoc iated T cell lymphoma , (EA TL), and have a normal 5-yea r survival (van 
Wan rooij et al. 2014 ). 
When the number s of aberra nt IELs exceed the 20% threshold. referr ed to as Type IT RCD 
(RCD-Jl ), the risk of deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_752401] L is dramatically increased to >50% (Nijeboe r et al. 
20 I 5a, 2015b). EA TL has a very poor 5-yea r survival of <20% (Nijeboer et al, 20 I 5a) and its 
prevalence is increasing (Shara i ha et ul. 2012).

a characteristic phenotype (presence of intracellular CD3without surface CD3 or TcR and 
generall y no C D8 expressio n with expressio n of CD I 03). that is also shared by [CONTACT_752465]. This phen otype is distinct from the nonnal phenotype of IE Ls in

the intestinal biopsy , confirm s the diagnos is ofRCD-11 and allows follow-up of the expan sion. 
Clinical guidelines (Rubio-Tapia et al. 2013) suggest 12 months of persistent disease activity 
while on a GFD as the timeframe that should trigger the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_752403] . Howeve r, the c urrent study uses 6 months as the required time on GFQ, 
since all patient s are evalua ted for aberrant IELs >20% by [CONTACT_4133] (or >50% by [CONTACT_4658]). 
representing definitive evidence of RCD-11 in the context of all other inclusion and exclusion 
criteria of the study (Nijeboer et al, 2015b ). This definitiv e evidence obviates the n eed to 
c aluate the diet for a full year. a requir ement only necessary when advanced diagnostic 
technique s arc unavailable and diagnosi s is made by [CONTACT_752466]. This approach 
wi II reduce both the risk or comp lications and disease ~volution if a patient was required to wait 
for [ADDRESS_1030259]-diagnosis. nor after this time. 
For the purpose of this study, and in agreement with leading experts in RCD- 11 (Malamut et 
al. 2010; Nijeboer et al. 2015a, 201 5b). aberrant IELs will be defined by [CONTACT_752467]3- negative. intra-cellular CD3-positive IELs (sCD3-. icCDJ +). The cut-off chosen 
for diagnosis of RCD-11 is 20% in accordance with most recent studies (Nijeboer er al. 20 I 5b ). 
In J HC. these cells are identified as icCDJ + sCD8- and the cut-off is 50% (Nijebocr cl al. 
2015b). 
Additionally. standa rd flow diagrams for the diagnosis of RCD- 11 (e.g., Rubi o-Tap ia el al, 2013) 
and exclusion of conditions that could simulate RCD-11 clinica lly and histologicall y are 
considered in the inclu sion/exc lusion criteria.

3-10 years due mainl y to intractable diarrhea and/or d evelopment of high grade EA TL 
lymphomas or. more rarely, to disseminati on of the low grade prolif eration to o ther tissues 
(e.g .. skin, lungs). The treatment of the high grade lymphoma (EA TL) relies on s urgical

The effects of AMG 714-HYB and AMG 714-CHO on NK cell coun ts were explored in three 
Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies (Hx-ILI 5-00 I, 20030210, 20060349) using immun ophenotypin g 
that included markers specific for NK cells. This analysis was based on the observed 
pharmacodynamic effects in preclinical spec ies. No changes in absolute or relative number s of 
NK cells were observed in either study at any or the dose levels tested. This result contrasts 
with observa tions in cynomolgus monkeys. where a marked reduction in N K cell counts was 
noted after admini stration of the s urrogat e antibody. Hu714Mu XHu. 
This difference between observat ions in preclinical and clinical studies appears related to a 
differential sensitivity of human versus cynomolgus monke y N K cells to I L-15 deprivation.

2 KNOWN AND ANTICIPATED RISKS 
2.1 NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELL DEPLETION ANO RISK OF 
INFECTION 
NK cell counts and NK cell activity were sig nificantly decrease d by [CONTACT_149614] -[ADDRESS_1030286] ion (Le brec et al, 2013). The 
absence of NK eel I depleti on in human s reduces concerns , and the risk of enteric infections 
will be closely mo nitored in fotthcomi ng clinical studies includ ing the proposed CELIM-RCD-
002 and CELIM- N RC D-00 I. 
T he s ponsor interpret s the lack of efficacy in psoriasis as suggestive of AMG 714"s selective 
effect on s pecific immun e pathways , rather than a broad systemic jmmun e suppr ession (since 
most systemic immun e suppr essants are efficac ious in psoriasis). 
2.2 IMMUNOGENICITY 
lmmun ogenicity (generation of a nti-drug antibodies [AD A]) is a potential risk for any b iologic 
therapeutic. Irnmun ogenic ity may lead to injection reactio ns and to loss of efficacy when the 
antib odies are neutrali zing and high-titer. 
AMG 714- [ADDRESS_1030287] s dosed with active drug in all four studies conducted with

In summ ary, immun ogen icity has been excep tionally reported with AMG 714. and the risk of

6 STUDY DESIGN 
Protocol CELIM-RCD-002 is designed to be a Phase 2a randomized. double-blind, placebo -
contro lled. parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AMG 714 for the 
treatment of adult patients with RDC- 11, an in situ sma ll bowel T cell lymphoma. 
After signing consen t, subjects will be screened for the study. All subjects who meet the study 
entry criteria will be randomized 2: I ratio to receive either 8 mg/kg AMG 714 or placebo a 
total of 7 times over I 0 weeks, with evaluation of the primary endpoint at Visit 8 (Week 12/Day 
84). 
AMG 714 (N= 16) or placebo (N=8) will be administered at the clinical site in a double-bli nd 
fashion via intravenous (IV) infusion of approximately 120 minute s (2 hours) duratio n. 
Subjects will remai n confined to the study site for a minimum or I hour after the admi nistration 
of study medication. Durin g this time the Investigator and study site stalTw ill assess the subject 
for A Es. As per Table I. PK samp les are to be collected prior to the infusion and I hour after 
the infusion, at the end of this obse rvation period. The beginning and end of the infusion. as 
well as the PK sample collection times , will be recorded. 
In addition to receiving study medicat ion (AMG 714 or placebo). concomitant therapy with 
steroids at a maxim um dose of20 mg of predn isonc. prednisolone or equiva lent per day and/or 
oral budesonide at a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_1030290] be 
stable for 4 weeks prior to randomization and remain stable for the duration or the sLudy. 
Budesonide has been used in RCD-11 with improvement of symptoms and is considered 
adequate background therapy for RCD-11 (Brar et al, 2007). 
Should AMG [ADDRESS_1030291] and the start 
of the possible open label t:xtension. the Sponsor intends to provide a bridging progra m to 
allow objec tive study responders to have access to AMG 714 as determined by [CONTACT_752485]. The open label extension study and interim bridging program will 
be described in independent protocols. 
Subjec ts will be expected to maintain total adherence to a GFD from 6 months before 
randomi zation through the final study visit (Visit 9; Week 16/Day I 12). Subject's adherence 
to the GFD will be assessed by [CONTACT_752486]. Subjects with known or suspected GFD transgressions will 
be counseled and allowed to continue in the study. 
A study site staff member will contact [CONTACT_752487]. Subjec ts will return to the clinic for the ne:-rt 
administration of study drug after I week (Visit 2; Week I/Day 7). After Visit 2. subjects will 
return to the clinic for follow-up and study drug administra tion at Visit 3 (Week 2/Day 14) and

11 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
All study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedu le of Events (Tabl e I). 
All visits. except the Follow-up Phone Call. Visit 2 (Week I /Day 7) and Visit 9 (Week 16/Day 
I 12) should be cond ucted within +/-3 days from the sched uled visit day relati ve to the 
randomization vi sit (unless otherwi se indicated). The Follow-up Phone Call shou ld be 
conducted within + I day from the randomization (Visit I; Week O /Day 0) visit date. The Visit 
1 {Week I /Day 7) study drug admini stration must be conducted on the schedu led visit date 
relative to the date of randomization. This visit cannot be conducted early and, shou ld it be 
conduc ted late, the visit schedule must be adjusted based on the actua l date of Visit 2 (Week 
I/Day 7). The Visit 8 endoscopy and biopsy (not the visit, but the e ndoscopy and biopsy only) 
can be conducted within+ /- 7 days of Visit 8, and Visit 9 (Week 16/Day 112) should be within 
+I-7 days from the original or adjusted scheduled visit date. 
All study visits occurrin g after rando mization (Visit I. Week 0/Day 0) should be based on the 
Visit I study vis it date. or the adjusted visit schedule in the event of a delayed Visit 2 (Weck 
I/Day 7). During the 12-week random ization period, subsequent to Visit 2 (Week I /Day 7). if 
a study visit occurs no more than a maximum of 4 days outside of the visit window (± 7) the 
study drug can be admi nistered and the next visit scheduled in accorda nce with the original or 
adjusted visit calendar. If a late study visit should occur more than 4 days outside of the study 
visit window the study drug should not be administered and a protoco l deviation recorded. 
Under no circumstances should any 2 doses of study drug be administered within fewer than 7 
days of each other.

13 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
13.J IMM UNOLOGICAL RESPONSE: ASSESSMENT OF ABERRANT 
INTRA£P ITHELIAL LYMPHOCYTES 
The primar y endpoint in this trial is the reduction in the % of aberranl intestinal IELs with 
respect to total I ELs as assessed by [CONTACT_752497]-cytometry (Immunolog ical Response 1 ). The first 
secondary endpoint is Immun ologica l Response 2, the reduct ion in the% of aberrant intestinal 
I ELs w ith respect to intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_265731]. a composite endpoint calculated by [CONTACT_752498] % of aberrant lEL vs total IELs (dete rmin ed by [CONTACT_752491]) by [CONTACT_941]% of total !EL vs 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. as assessed by [CONTACT_9064]. The secondary endpo int could 
be more representative of a benefit driven by [CONTACT_752499] 
I EL number s. 
Both endpoints address the core abnormal ity in RCD-11, an in situ sma ll bowel T cell 
lymphoma in which aberra nt lymphocytes are respons ible for mucosa I damage and sympt oms 
and for the progression to EA TL. Aberrant IE Ls are d escribed as surface CD3 -negative. 
intracellular CD3-posilive. The reduction in the proportion and number of aberran t 
lymphocytes is spec ific lo RCD- 11. is analogous to a reduction in tumor size in a solid tumor 
cance r. and has been propo sed as the most direct meas urement of efficacy in RCD- 11 (as 
reviewed in van Wanr ooij et nl. 2014). 
This exploratory study, first industry-sponsored trial in RCD-11. will be considered positive for 
the purposes of Go-No decision-making if at least one of the two calculations of 
Imm unological Response is found to be positive. 
Flow cytometry is the most accurate tool available to quantif y aberrant I ELs (van Wanr ooij el 
al. 2014), and it is preferred over IHC, (less sensitive) and TcR rearrang ement or clonality by 
[CONTACT_940] (PCR , less specific) (van Wanrooij el al, 201 4 ). Enumerati on of 
total lELs will be done by [CONTACT_752500]% of aberrant IELs vs 
intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Enumerati on of aberrant (intracellular CD3) and abno rmal (altered 
phenoty pe. such as overexpression of NKG2D) IELs by [CONTACT_752501], as exploratory endpoints.

Flow cytometry of IELs requires the acqu isition of fragment( s) of small bowel tissue by 
[CONTACT_464407]. and the method to disperse, stain and analy ze the IELs is described 
elsewhere (Leon. 2011 ). 
Flow cytomec ry is the clinical- grade technique employed and validated in the routine 
phen otypi[INVESTIGATOR_752418] s such as leukemias and lymphomas. It is exqui sitely 
quantitative( > I 0.000 single cells are quant ified by [CONTACT_752502] s) (Leo n 2011, van Wanroo ij et al. 2014). The large number of cells 
stained and analyzed. est imated to be betwe en 0.5 milli on and 5 million per time point per 
patient. ensures low variabi lity and reproducibilit y. All sites will use the same proced ure and 
experimental protocol. and technical validati on\ ill be pcrfonned prior to study start. 
13.2 HISTOLOC lC RESPONSE: SMALL BOWELL ENDOSCOPY , BIOP SY 
AND HISTOLOGY 
At each time point specified in Table I. sma ll-bowe l biops ies will be collected in order to 
perfonn the aberrant IEL analy sis and the histological assess ment of muco sa) inflamm ation. 
The latter will provide the secondary endp oint of Histological Response. as measured by 
[CONTACT_752503]:CD ratio assess ed with a validated 
morphometric analysis (Taave la el al. 2013). Lack of Histological Response has been shown 
to corre late with long te rm outcomes includin g progre ssion to EATL (Nijeboe r el al, 2015 a. 
b). albeit the current Phase 2a study may be of insufficient dura1i on lo fully assess histological 
recovery (slower than immunologic resolution). In addition to the VI l:CD ratio. the second 
commonly used histological score. the Marsh-Oberhub er classification (Marsh, 1992. 
Oberhuber 2000) . as well as the total IEL count (all IEL. not just aberrant) will also be 
calcula1ed as a secondary endpoint. 
Al each time point spec ified in Table I. approxima tely eleven to thirteen ( 11-13) fragment s or 
specimens of small-b owel tissue will be taken from the second part of the duodenum distal to 
the ampulla by [CONTACT_170579]- oral upper endoscopy and forceps biopsy. Biopsies should be collected 
from the 0 2 segment of the duodenum. Ulcerative lesion s should be avoided. The location and 
macroscop ic appearance of the tissue will be noted in rhe source documents. The potential 
presence of an) obse rvable lesion uch as ulcerati ve jejuniti s will be captured in the eCRF. 
When nece ssary. sampl es will be re-oriented and sectioned again until they are of good quality. 
The proced ures will be described in a Study or Laboratory Manual or similar document, and 
the I EL/LPL prepa ration meth od wi II be based on published meth ods by [CONTACT_752504]. The 
fragments or specimen s will be prioritized as follows:

Marsh-Obe rhuber sco re will be given (MO, M I, M2. M3a. M3b, or M3c) and 
the density of CD3-positive IE Ls (cells/I 00 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]) will be assessed. 
Histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC, e.g .. the determination or 
NKG2D on IEL) analysis will be performed following standard operating 
procedures for fixed biopsy spec imen orientation. paraffin embedding. 
cuttin g, staining and scanning for whole slide virtual microscopy. Standard 
operating procedures will also be followed for biopsy morphometry readin gs 
using validated meth ods (Taavela et al, 2013). If it is not feasible to measure 
at least [ADDRESS_1030314]'s given biopsies. even after re-cutting. 
the results will be considered not evaluable. 
111. Three specimen s collected for experimental biomarkers: Approximate ly three 
(3) specimens will be used for biomarker research. Two fragments will be 
placed in mRNA preservative for future mRNA analysis and one will be used 
for TcR clonality (fres h, frozen or embedded in paraffin). 
1v. Optiona lly, two fragments for functional expe riments: Two spec imens. if 
available. may be used fresh in select sites for analysi s of I L-15 related 
functi onal biornarkers. Measurement of AMG 714 in the biopsies may be 
attempted. In Finland one or both optional specime ns wi 11 be used in some 
patien ts for crypt cell ·'mini-gut'· in vitro cullll re at baseline and post-
treatment to study bioma rkers of epi[INVESTIGATOR_752419]-

Every effort will be made to collect all 11 to 13 specime ns, but shou ld this number not be 
reached. the specimens wi 11 be allocated in the order indicated. 
13.3 CLINICAL RESPON SE: BRISTOL STOOL FORM SCALE (BSFS ) AND 
GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS RATING SCALE (GSRS) 
Clinical Respo nse, based on sympto ms record ed with patient reported outcome (PRO)

13.3.2 Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) 
The GSRS (Append ix D) is a 15-question 7 scale questionnaire used to assess five dimen sions 
or gastrointestinal syndrom es: diarrh ea. indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain and reflux 
( vedlund et al 1988). While not specific for celiac disea se. the GSRS is widely used in 
gastroenterology and has been used in several clinical trials of experimental medication s in 
celiac disease. thus becoming a very useful tool with abundant existing reforencc data (Kelly 
el al 2013: Uihdeaho et al. 2011: Leffler el al, 2015). 
Subjects will be asked to complet e this questionnaire week ly, using an electronic diary. from 
the day of randomization through the Final tudy Visit. 
The analy sis w ill include the full GSRS questionnaire as well as the subset of question s most 
closely related to celiac disease (termed "Celiac GSRS" or CeD-GSRs··) (Leffler el al. 2015).

14.2 ASSESSMENT OF THE GLUTEN-FREE- DIET : JVYL ISA GIP STOOL 
TEST AND DIETITIAN CONSUL TATION 
In celiac disease, identification or gl uten contamination is essential for the management or the 
disease and for the succes sful conduct of clinica l trials. Contaminating gluten is a confounding 
factor in both diagnosis of RCD- [ADDRESS_1030317] inadvertent gluten 
consumption by [CONTACT_155944] g gluten immun ogenic peptides (GIP) in feces (Com ino el al. 2012). 
The iVYLISA GI P-S test has a CE mark and is commercially available in Europe from 
8 iomedal SL (as a research test) and. at the time of this writing. from LA BCO (as a laboratory-
developcd test). iVYLISA GIP-S measures GIP in stools by [CONTACT_752505]. a sandwich ELISA 
with antibody G12. specilic for an immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_752421]. The lower quantification limit of the assay is 0.16 µg of GI P/g of

feces and the upper quantification limit is 5 µg GIP/g of feces. In unpubli shed results from 
Biome dal (De liac clinical trial; manu script submitted) , gluten in feces is highly corre lated with 
mucosa ! atroph y in celiac patient s on a purported GFD. The sensitivity and specificity have 
been 96.3 % and I 00%, respect ively, with positive and negative predi ctive values of I 00% and 
96.1 %, respective ly, in the aforeme ntioned celiac study. 
This assay will be used in the CELIM-R CD-[ADDRESS_1030318], adherence to the GFD will be assessed periodically (Table

14.4 Q UALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNA lRES : SF-[ADDRESS_1030319] 12 
questions to measu re functional health and well-being from the patien t·s point of view. 
The Sf--I 2v2 cove rs the same eight health doma ins as the SF-36v2 with one or two quest ions 
per domain (Ware. et al. 2009). 
The EQ-50 is a simple. brief and standardized instrument for use as a measure of health 
outcome (http://www.euroqol.o rg/abo ut-eq-5d. html). The SL version, available since 2009. 
will be used in the study. 
14.5 BIOMARK ERS OF DISEASE ACTIVITY 
Seve ral biomarkers of disease activity will be analyzed in serum (e.g., CRP. IL-15. s1 L- 1 5R ), 
as exploratory indicator s of disease activity and potential predict ors of respon se to AMG 714. 
Flow cytometry will be perfonned with fresh whole blood and with intestinal mucosal cells 
(I EL and /amino proprio cells). Blood flow cytom etry may be conducted on isolated pe.riphcral 
blood mononuc lear cells and/or directly in whole blood. Flow cytometry will be used to 
Jescribc rhe phenotype of bl ood (includ ing NK cells) and intestinal cells. including marke rs 
relevant to the enumeration (e.g., C03. CDI03) and function (e.g .. NKG2 0 ) of aberrant IELs. 
lmmunohi stochemistry (IHC) will be performed in biopsy tissue to assess marke rs on IELs 
(e.g., NKG2 D) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. 
Biomarkcr s of I L-15 biology may also be analyzed in fresh biopsies. if available at sites with 
the relevanr experimental capabilities. 
Jn addit ion, other exploratory biomarkers may be analyzed at a later time in stored samp les. 
including serum (for proteins. RNA). blood cell pellet (for future bioma rkers using gene 
expression profiling and possibly lymph oma mutatio nal analysis), biopsy fragments (for 
mRNA. protein. and possib ly lymph oma mutati onal analysis), stool (glute n. microbi omc). 
urine (gluten. metabo lites). Future bi omarker analysis will solely be for the purpose of celiac 
disease or AMO [ADDRESS_1030320] be obtained PRIOR to study drug admin istration at each 
time point listed in the schedule of events (Tab le I). The time and date of sampling must be 
carefull y recorded and reported in the eCRFs. 
Select safety biomarkers will be evaluated as well as exploratory indicators of possible clinical 
efficacy, such as BMT (derived from the weight measures at every visit), serum albumin 
(patient with albumin being provided exogenously will be excluded from this analysis), 
hemog lobin, hemat ocrit. 
14.6. IMM UNOGEN IClTY 
A two tiered immunogenicity testing approach will be used in order to determine if a sample 
contain s ADAs. Samples will be initiall y tested in an immun oassay (ELISA). Sample s that test 
positive for binding antibodies will then be tested in a bioassay (CTLL -2 cell line that responds 
to recombinant human IL-15). to de tect neutralizing antibodies (NAb). 
The sensitivity of the ELISA assay is approximately 20 ng/mL and the lower limit of reliable 
detection (LLRD), even in the prese nce of serum level s of drug, is approximate ly 250 ng/mL. 
The LLRD of the bioassay is approx imate ly 1.5 µg/mL. 
In addit ion to these existing validated methods. the spons or will develop and validate a 
bridging immun oassay (for bindin g AD A) and a target binding method (for neutralizin g AD A) 
in the Mesa cale Discove ry (MSD ) platform to potentially improve performance. The final 
method chosen will be desc ribed in the study manual and regulatory submissio ns 
14.7 CELIAC DISEASE PATIENT REPO RTED OUTCOME (CED PRO) 
Subjects will be asked to maincain a daily e-dia ry for the CeD PRO instrum ent (Appendix K) 
at times indicated on the Schedu le of Events (Table I). This questionnaire was developed to 
assess symptom severity in clinical trials in subjects with celiac disease. 
Items in the questionnair e were formulated based on one-on-on e interviews with patient s with 
celiac disease, thus they reflect the symptoms that patient s consider part of their celiac disease 
expe rience. The questionna ire is designed as a self-admini stered daily diary. to be completed 
at the same time each day, and requires less than I 0 minute s to complete. It includes 9-itcms 
asking participants about the seve rity of eeliac disease symptoms they may experienc e each 
day. Participants are asked to rate their symptom severity on an 11 -point, 0 to I 0 scale; from 
··not experienc ing the symptom· ' to ·'the worst possible symptom experience ··. Symptoms 
include abdominal cramp ing. abdominal pain. bloating . gas. diarrh ea. loose stool. nausea. 
headache and tiredness.

22.1 SAMP LE SIZE DETERM INATION 
The CELIM-R CD-00 2 study is an exploratory proof-of-concept (POC) study of an 
experimental medication , AMG 714. in RCD-JJ patient s. While it will be the first such s tudy 
spon sored by a pharmaceutical compan y, the straightforward design is based on several 
academic studie s (Goe rres et al, 2003: Brar et al, 2007: Tack et al. 2011 a, 20 I I b) as well as 
on the nonclini cal proof-of-principle signal obtained with AMG 714 in intestinal explant s from 
patients with RCD-11 (Malamut et al. 20 I 0). 
The sample size is based on the size or previ ous acade mic studies. Pub I ished prosp ective 
academi c srudies have ranged from 13 to 18 patients total (Tac k et al. 20 I I a. 2011 b) and 
CELIM-RCD-[ADDRESS_1030350] prospective trial ever cond ucted in RCD- 11, a very rare 
malignant disea se. 
The sample size of approxima tely 24 subjects ( 16 subjects in AMG 714 arm and 8 subjects in 
placeb o urm) has been calcu lated to achieve at least -80% power to det ect a 20 percentage 
point diffe rence in the primar y endpoi nt. the difference in the baseline -to-Week 12 reductio n 
of% aberrant IELs vs total IELs between the AMG 714 arm and placebo arm. 
This sample size calculation was based on the follow ing assump tions: 
• Two-sided type one error rate a = 0.1 
• Power 1-P = 0.8 
• Analysis method: one-way ANOVA by [CONTACT_78718]® (proc power) 
• 2: l allocation ratio between the AMG 714 and placeb o arms 
• Common D = 17.4 for the baseline to Week 12 reducti on in% aberrant I ELs 
as assesse d by [CONTACT_6398]-cytome try 
• Mean chang e of 20 percent age point s and 0 percentage points in the baseline 
to Week 1 2 reduc tion in % aberrant I ELs in the AMG 714 and placebo arms.

• No drop- outs account ed (effo11s will be made to replace drop-outs befor e 
Week 6 and/or su~jects who do not provide the seco nd biopsy) 
The standard deviation used for the sample size calculation is computed from the% aberra nt

local guidelin es require additional testing. 
• Subjects who test positive only for surface antibody (anti- HBs+ ) are eligibl e for this 
study unless local guidelines require additional testing. 
• ubjects who test positiv e only for core antibody (anti-HB c+ ) must undergo further 
testing for hepat itis B deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA test). If the HBV DNA test is 
positive , the subject is not eligible for this study. If the HBV DNA test is negative , the

Protocol CELIM - RC D- [ADDRESS_1030377] ED EXPOSURE AND SAFETY MARGIN S 
Table 4 shows predictions of expos ure and safety margins calculated for proposed 8 mg/kg IV 
q2w dosing with an additional dose at Week I. 
Two sets of assumptions were used: a) that AMG 714 PK in RCD-1 1 patients is the same as in 
healthy subjects. and b) that AMG 714 clearance is higher in RCD- 11 patients due to protein 
leakage in the intestine, and that the exte nt of the leakage is reflected in the serum albumin 
values. 
The data used in the calculations are described in Table 4. Calculations are described be low

Title An open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_312179] p ilaris  (PRP)  
Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312178], MD, PhD  
Objectives  To determine whether guselkumab provides clinical improvement for 
subject s with PRP who are candidates for systemic therapy  
Trial Configuration  Single center, open label, interventional , investigator -initiated  trial 
Setting  The trial will recruit 15 adults with moderate -to-severe (defined by 
[CONTACT_312227]  (BSA) ≥ 10%) PRP through dermatologist 
offices, recruitment letters, and adverti sement.  
Study visits will occur at Screening , weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 20 , 24, and 36. 
Study visits at weeks 0 , 4, and 24 will be required in -person; the 
remaining visits optionally will be performed via secure video -
conferencing using the OHSU Nexus (Cisco Mee ting) app , between the 
investigator and the subject , as well as a RE DCap survey  sent via email . 
Sample Size Estimate  With measurement of the mean paired difference in PASI score before 
and after treatment of a minimum of [ADDRESS_384616] 80% 
power at the 0.[ADDRESS_384617] deviation is 8 -points. Due to the uncertainty 
inherent with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the goal number of subjects with PRP who 
will be recruited for the study is 15.

Page 8 of 34 1.		BACKGROUND 	
1.1. Overview of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_312183] P ilaris (PRP) and Guselkumab   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_173798] (PRP) is a rare and poorly understood severe i nflammatory cutaneous disease 
characterized by [CONTACT_312229] (often full -body) erythematous plaques, skin flaking and ichthyosis, painful  
thickening  and cracking  of the palms and soles , hair loss, crumbling nails, and severe skin pruritus and 
burning. The mos t common type of PRP affects otherwise -healthy adults and may be explosive in onset. 
Although PRP does not affect internal organs and  no quality -of-life impact studies have been published, 
the high degree of morbidity is perhaps best illustrated by [CONTACT_312230] a 
PRP Facebook support group (with >800 members):   
“All I want is normal skin. .. for my eyes to stop watering constantly, to take off my clothes one time 
and not be shrouded by a cloud of dusty skin flakes ...” 
“My hu sband can barely walk or use his hands.”  
“My scalp is like the Sahara Desert experiencing the dust storm of the century.”  
“I want my life back!!! Please.”  
Not surprisingly, one study showed over half of patients with PRP reporting depression (1).  
 
While the pathogenesis of PRP is poorly understood, similarities with inflammatory pathways in psoriasis 
have been reported.  The major effector cells present in psoriatic lesions are Th17 cells , and a recent case 
report showed  similar  overexpression of cytokin es in the Th17 pathway in cutaneous lesions of PRP , 
including the primary effector cytokines IL -23, IL -22, and IL -17 (2). Additionally, familial cases of both 
psoriasis and PRP have been associated with germline ga in-of-function mutations in the caspase 
recruitment domain family, member 14 (CARD14) gene (3, 4), and cutaneous overexpression of CARD14 
was observed in cases of sporadic PRP (5). CARD14 overexpression in vitro  has also been shown to 
induce excess IL -23 (6). 
 
Guselkumab is a high affinity, humanized IgG1  lambda  monoclonal antibody that selectively binds  the 
p19 subunit of IL -23. Two phase III studies of guselkumab in the treatment of psoriasis showed excellent 
safety and efficacy, with “clear” or “almost clear” skin ratings in 84-85% of patients at week -16 (7, 8). 
 
There is no FDA -approved th erapy for PRP, not a single published systematic therapeutic clinical trial, 
and no established guidelines for measuring disease severity. Commonly prescribed systemic 
medications include acitretin  and methotrexate, but these have treatment failure rates o f over 40% (1) 
and can be limited by [CONTACT_99766]. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been used for PRP but have 
even higher failure rates (1). While there are no published reports of IL -23p19 subunit -targeted therapy in 
PRP, there are case report s and case series of the use of IL -12/IL -23p40 subunit inhibition for PRP in 
over twenty patients (2, 9-23) with 90% of these  showing marked improvement , often  only [ADDRESS_384636] injection and at week -4 and week -24. Blood tests will 
be performed for screening and safety  and measuring levels of inflammation  at Screening, week -0, week -
4, and week -24. The study schedule is outlined  in Section 5.4. , Table 1 . 
 
3.2. Study Endpoints  
3.2.1. 	Primary	 Endpoint 	
Mean change  from baseline  PASI  at week -24 after treatment with guselkumab . 
The Psoriasis Severity Index (PASI) is a well -validated tool for measuring psoriasis, based on redness, 
thickness, scale, and body surface area  assessed by [CONTACT_093] , with a maximum score of 72 points. 
This is exp ected to be a useful tool for PRP, since PRP is characterized by [CONTACT_312231] , and is often initially misdiagnosed as severe psoriasis . The mean thickness score is 
expected to be lower in PRP than psoriasis but the mean body sur face area (BSA) is expected to be 
higher than psoriasis . 
 
3.2.2.	Secondary	 Endpoints	A ssessed	by	 [CONTACT_10670] 	
• Time to improvement by 50% in the PASI score (PASI 50)  
• Mean reduction in body surface area ( BSA) at week -24. BSA is collected as part of  the PASI 
assessment tool.  
• Proportion of subject s achieving a Physician’s Global Assessment  (PGA)  of 0 or 1 at week -24 
• Proportion of subject s achieving a Palmoplantar Physician’s Global Assessment  (PPPGA)  of 0 or 
1 at week -24. Palmoplantar disease will be assessed s eparately from overall disease since it has 
high morbidity and may respond differently to therapy.  
• Mean percentage improvement in nail involvement measured  by [CONTACT_312232] 
(NAPSI ) at week -24. The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) (24) will be used for evaluating 
the fingernails and toenails of subject s with PRP. This is expected to be useful tool because nails 
in PRP have many overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_312184], splinter 
hemorrhages, nail oil drop (yellow -brown) discoloration, and nail bed hyperkeratosis, although 
PRP nails are less likely to have onycholysis and red spots i n the lunula (25). 
 
3.2.3.	Secondary	 Endpoints 	Assessed	by	 [CONTACT_27720] 	
• Proportion of subjects  achieving a 4 -point improvement in quality of life measured by [CONTACT_47738] ( DLQI ) at week -24, proportion of patients achieving a DLQI of 0 or 
1 at week -24, and mean improvement in DLQI score at week -24. The DLQI  (26) is a validated 
tool for inflammatory skin conditions. It is a 10 -question survey, scored 0 – 30 points. For 
 
Page 10 of 34 inflammatory s kin conditions, a 4 -point change in DLQI score is considered clinically important 
(27). 
• Mean percentage in improvement in Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) at week -24, 
and proportion of patients achieving a PSSD of zero at week -24. The PSSD is an 11 -question 0 – 
10-point numeric rating scale (NRS) patient -reported outcome measure assessing itch, dryness, 
cracking, skin tightness, scaling, shedding or flaking, bleeding, bu rning, stinging, and pain over 
the last 24 hours and 7 days respectively  (28). 
• Mean change from baseline individual PRP Area and Severity Index ( iPRPASI ) at week -[ADDRESS_384637] self -assessment score of 
disease involvement and severity, based on a previously published similar tool validated for 
psoriasis  (29). 
• Sustained remission at week -36, [ADDRESS_384638] induced sustained remission of PRP (22), so there is a potential that treatment may “reset” 
the immune response and lead to long -term improvement in the disease, especial ly in subjects  
without genetic mutations. Subjects  will be treated with guselkumab  as per the FDA -approved 
psoriasis treatment guidelines, and therapy will be stopped after the [ADDRESS_384639] s will 
be monitored at 24 weeks (primary study endpoint) a nd then at 36 weeks to assess for sustained 
remission versus relapse.  
3.2.4.	Exploratory/ Mechanistic 	Endpoints 	
• Treatment  response, as measured by [CONTACT_47736] 50,  stratified by  [CONTACT_207028] o r absence of  germline 
CARD14 mutations . Genetic CARD14 gain -of-function m utations were identified in 3 families with 
familial PRP as well as 12.5% of individuals with sporadic PRP (3). Genetic CARD14 mutations 
will be measured in study subjects and associated with treatment response to guselkumab . 
Additionally, de -identified samples will be stored  indefinitely  for future analysis of genes 
associated with PRP.  
• Normalization of CARD14 epi[INVESTIGATOR_312185] -24. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_312186]14 muta tions, immunohistochemical staining of CARD14 in 6 of 6 
biopsies from sporadic cases of PRP without germline genetic mutations showed increased 
expression of CARD14 in the keratinocyte spi[INVESTIGATOR_312187] (2). 
CARD14 is thought to act in a synergistic manner with IL -17, activating the transcription factor 
NF-kB. NF -kB activation was shown in vitro  to stimulate IL -36gamma, which may induce an 
amplifying feedback loop from IL -23 to IL -17 and b ack again (6). Cutaneous biopsies will be 
obtained from subject s before and 24 weeks after treatment with guselkumab . Inhibition of IL -17 
by [CONTACT_312233]14 expression by k eratinocytes.  
• Normalization of cutaneous gene expression  at week s 4 and 24. Upregulation of Th17 cytokines 
(IL-17A, IL -17F, IL -22) and pro -inflammatory innate cytokines (TNF, IL -6, IL-12, IL -23, IL -1beta) 
compared to normal skin were  observed in lesional s kin from [ADDRESS_384640] s with PRP (5). In order to 
better understand the inflammatory pathways involved in PRP, lesional and non -lesional  biops ies 
will be obtained from subject s at week -[ADDRESS_384641] dose of guse lkumab , week -4, and week -
24. Cutaneous gene expression of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_312188] (RNA -Seq and therapeutic response to guselkumab  is expected to correlate with 
normalization of epi[INVESTIGATOR_312189].  De-identified ti ssue samples will be stored indefinitely 
for analysis.  
• Change in serum cytokine levels at weeks [ADDRESS_384642] 
been shown to correlate with disease activity in patients with psoriasis (30) but these have not 
been investigated in patients with PRP.  Serum cytokine levels before and after treatment with 
guselkumab will  be analyzed by [CONTACT_312234] -based immunoassay.

4.3. Recruitment and Identification of Participants  
The trial will  recruit subjects with  moderate -to-severe PRP , either newly diagnosed or failing other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312190].  A number of recruitment strategies will be utilized for this 
study proven to be effective by [CONTACT_312236].  
• OHSU and community dermatology clinics  
• OHS U OCTRI Cohort Discovery tool to identify patients  with PRP via Epic , and a phone call to 
those patients  
• Publicity on the PRP Support Group Facebook page  with prior approval of Facebook page 
manager  
• Publicity through the PRP Alliance patient advocacy organ ization, including an email to members 
of the PRP Alliance , following prior approval from listserv manager  
• Research Match  
• Letters mailed to physicians outside of OHSU  
 
4.4. Vulnerable Populations  
Children, neonates, pregnant women, prisoners, and decisiona lly impaired adults will not be enrolled in 
the study.  
 
5.	STUDY	PROCEDURES,	 EVALUATIONS ,	AND	SCHEDULE 	
5.[ADDRESS_384648] with the study team, an overview of the trial will be given.  Because of the rarity of  
PRP, subjects may be traveling from distant locations for the study; thus the phone script is intended to 
be somewhat more comprehensive for a subject to determine if they are interested and able to 
participate.  If they would like to participate, a  reques t for information will be signed by [CONTACT_312237]’s healthcare providers to review records pertinent to the diagnosis of PRP. Once the 
study investigator has reviewed the records and confirmed that a diagnosis of PRP has been made by a 
qualified healthcare provider,  an appointment for a screening visit will be made. For subjects in whom  the 
screening visit will be completed by [CONTACT_144891], the informed consent form will be emailed or mailed to 
the subject prior to the screening visit.  
 
5.1.2 .	Screening 	
Subjects  will read the informed consent form and all questions about the study will be answered  by a 
study investigator and research staff .  Scree ning questions will be asked and  eligibility will be determined 
by [CONTACT_312238] . Subjects will be asked about vaccine history to ensure that recommended 
vaccines are up to date, and subjects will be reminded that live vaccines  (such as the intranasal influenza 
vaccine , BCG vaccine,  or live varicella zoster vaccine (Zostavax))  are not  permitted during the study.  
Contraception method will also be recorded.  An investigator will perform an assessment of BSA to 
calculate  disease  severity. If all other criteria are met, a blood sample will be drawn to screen for 
pregnancy (in female subject s), HBV, HCV, HIV , and QuantiFERON gold for tuberculosis,  and to check 
CBC and CMP.  If subjects have had HBV, HCV, HIV, and tuberculosis testing within 3 months prior to 
screening, records of these results will be sufficient and the tests will not be repea ted. [COMPANY_003] skin testing 
may be used if blood testing for tuberculosis is unavailable.  
 
Page 13 of 34 For interested subjects, t he screening  visit may be performed via secure video -conferencing using the 
OHSU Nexus (Cisco Meeting) app , in which case the study consent will be reviewed  during the 
telemedicine videoconference . Eligible subjects willing to proceed with treatment will be asked  to 
document consent  via e -consent in REDCap , or signed written consent emailed  or faxed to  the 
investigators . Following receipt of signed consent, a screening blood draw will be performed at the lab of 
the subject’s  choice  and results will be sent  to the investigators.   
Upon confirmation of normal blood tests as defined in the exclusion criteria subject s will be scheduled for 
enrollment and V isit [ADDRESS_384649] will be informed and referred to her or his primary care physician 
for assessment . 
For Spanish -speaking subjects, the Engli sh-written consent form will be verbally translated with the help 
of a Spanish interpreter. All questions regarding the study will be translated to study staff and answered 
to patient satisfaction. Subjects will then be provided the adapted boilerplate con sent, “Consent Form – 
Short – Spanish,” to sign. A copy of both signed consents will be provided to the patient and uploaded in 
the patient’s chart.  
 
5.1.3 .	Enrollment 	
The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be re -reviewed and subjects may proceed with visit  1 on the same day  
if they continue to meet criteria.

• Acetaminophen, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or ibuprofen as needed  
• Subjec ts will maintain their usual medication regimen for other concomitant diseases throughout 
the study unless specifically excluded in the protocol. Subject s taking concomitant medications 
should be on a stable dose throughout the study, unless changes need t o be made for an AE or 
for appropriate medical management.  If a medication is changed, the changed and reason for it 
will be documented.  Additional systemic drugs are to be avoided during the study, unless 
 
Page [ADDRESS_384663] s should be instructed 
to consult the investigator or other appropriate study personnel at the site before taking any new 
medications or supplements.  All therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prescription, over -the-counter, vitamins, herbal 
supplements , vaccines ) will be recorded in the eCRF  as outlined in the Study Procedures.  
7.	STATISTIC AL	CONSIDERATIONS 	
7.1. Sample Size Computation and Power Analysis  
This is a pi [INVESTIGATOR_312194]; thus a power analysis was performed with the 
following rough assumptions. With measurement of the mean paired difference in PASI score before 
and after treatment of a minimum of [ADDRESS_384664] 80% powe r at the 0.[ADDRESS_384665]-visit. 
 
7.2.1 .	Primary	 Endpoint	 Analysis 	
• Mean improvement from baseline PASI at week -24 will be an alyzed for statistical significance 
using a paired, two -tailed Student’s t -test. 
 
7.2.2 .	Secondary	 Endpoint	 Analyses: 	
• Time (weeks) to improvement by 50% in the PASI score (PASI 50) will be reported as  a mean 
with standard deviation and also represented gra phically.  
• Mean improvement from baseline BSA at week -24 will be analyzed for statistical significance 
using a paired, two -tailed Student’s t -test. 
• The proportion of subject s achieving a Physician’s Global Assessment of 0 or 1 at week -24 will 
be reported as  a proportion, and compared with historical estimates of treatment success with 
acitretin and methotrexate (1). 
• The proportion of subject s achieving a Palmoplantar Physician’s Global Assessment of 0 or 1 at 
week -24 will be reported as a proportion.  
• The mea n improvement in nail involvement measured by [CONTACT_312247] (see below) at week -24 will be 
analyzed for statistical significance using a paired, two -tailed Student’s t -test. 
• The proportion of subject s achieving a 4 -point improvement in  DLQI  and the proportion of 
subjects achieving a DLQI score of 0 or 1  at week -24 will be reported as proportion s. The mean 

 
Page 21 of 34 improvement in DLQI score from week -0 to week -24 will be analyzed using a paired, two -tailed 
Student’s t -test. 
• The mean improvement in  PSSD  at week -24 will be ana lyzed for statistical significance using a 
paired, two -tailed Student’s t -test. The propo rtion of subjects achieving a PSSD of zero at week -
24 will be reported as a proportion.  
 
7.2.3 .	Exploratory	 Endpoint	 Analyses 	
• Sustained remission at week -36, measured by [CONTACT_312248] -24 to 
week -36, will be analyzed for statistical significance using a paired, two -tailed Student’s t -test. 
• Treatment response, as measured by [CONTACT_47736] 50, will be stratified by [INVESTIGATOR_266612]14 germline mutations. 
The proportion  of subjects with a PASI 50 response with and without CARD14 mutations will be 
reported and compared for statistical significance using an unpaired, two -tailed Student’s t -test. 
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_312195]14 will be assessed qualitatively by a trained de rmatopathologist 
who is blinded to the biopsy collection time (before or after therapy).  
• The gene expression level from  the tissue biopsy, before , 4 weeks,  and 24 weeks after treatment,  
will be analyzed for statistical significance using a pared, two -tailed Student’s t -test and also 
compared with normal  and psoriatic  skin using a two -tailed, two -sample Student’s t -test with 
unequal variance  adjusted for multiple comparisons . 
• The cytokine level from  serum  before , 4 weeks,  and 24 weeks after treatment, will b e analyzed 
for statistical significance using a pared, two -tailed Student’s t -test and also compared with 
normal  and psoriatic  serum  using a two -tailed, two -sample Student’s t -test with unequal variance  
adjusted for multiple comparisons .

8.1. Specification of Safety Parameters  
As the sponsor of the Study, OHSU and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_172788], within the 
required timelines, any safety reporting obligation to compe tent Health Authorities, IRB  and any 
participating (co or sub) i nvestigators, as defined in applicable laws and regulations.  For the purposes of 
this protocol, safety data includes adverse events, product quality complaints (PQCs), and special 
situations including pregnancies. Safety assessments will be based on medic al review of adverse events 
and the results of safety evaluations at specified time points as described in Section 5.[ADDRESS_384666] igator until resolution/stabilization or death, whichever comes first.  
OHSU and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_312196], special 
situations including pregnancies and product quality complaints as defined withi n this protocol.  
This Study has been designated as an interventional study.  As such, all adverse events for Janssen 
Study drugs regardless of causality and special situations excluding those from subjects not exposed to a 
Janssen Study drug and product qu ality complaints with or without an adverse event as described in this 
Protocol will be reported from the time a subject has signed and dated an Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
until completion of the subject’s last study -related procedure (which may include c ontact for follow -up 
safety).  Serious adverse events will be reported up to week -36 ([ADDRESS_384667] dose of study 
drug). 
 
8.2. Definitions  
8.2.1 .	Adverse	Event	(AE) 	
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject a dministered a medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
 
Page 22 of 34 (including an abnormal find ing), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or 
non-investigational) product. (Definition per International Conferen ce on Harmonisation [ICH])  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 
8.2.2 .	Serious	Adverse	 Event	(SAE) 	
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Study drugs for 
Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death . (Note: death for any reason will be reported as a serious adverse e vent.)  
• Is life -threatening . (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11636]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a study drug   
• Serious Infections  
• Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions  
• Suicidality  
• Cardiovascular events  
• Medically important*  
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in dea th or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312197]. These should usually be considered 
serious.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].	Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312198], it i s the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312199].  
 
Any event requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312200] a serio us adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23742] (e.g., social reasons such 
as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into  the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312201]. Any 
adverse event that re sults in a prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312202] a new serious adverse event.]

[IP_ADDRESS].	Life -Threatening 	Conditions 	
The cause of death of a subject in a study within [ADDRESS_384668] dose of study drug, whether or not 
the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a serious adverse event.

participant and/or participant may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include:  
• Allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home,  
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or

a previously identified signal (even if non -serious).   No adverse even ts of special interest will be 
collected for this study.   
 
8.2.4.	Individual	Case	Safety	Report	(ICSR) 	
A valid ICSR will contain the four minimum criteria requred to meet regulatory reporting requirements.  
• an identifiable subject (but not disclosing person al information such as the subject’s name, initials 
or address)  
• an identifiable reporter (investigational site)  
• a Janssen study drug  
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situations  
 
The minimum information required will be : 
• suspected Janssen study  drug (doses, indication)  
• date of therapy (start and end date, if available)  
• batch or lot number, if available  
• subject details (subject ID and country)  
• gender  
• age at AE onset  
• reporter ID  
• adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatednes s, causality, action taken, 
outcome, (if available)  
• Janssen protocol ID  
 
8.2.5.	Product	Quality	Complaint	(PQC) 	
A product quality compliant is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect  related to a potential quality 
issue during manufacturing, packaging , release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or 
distribution of the product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers 
are of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples o f PQC include but not limited to:  
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e .g., autoinjector button not wo rking, needle detaching from 
syringe  
• Suspected Contamination

8.2.6 .	Unanticipated	Problems	(UP) 	
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers UPs inv olving risks to participants or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the Tremfya package insert ; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population 
being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outc ome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
This study will use the OHRP definition of UP.  
 
8.3. Adverse Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
The oc currence of an UP, AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits 
and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by [CONTACT_978] . All AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criter ia for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate eCRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, seriousness, expectedness, relationship to study product (assessed only by 
[CONTACT_312249] a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of the event. 
All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs 
will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition  that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
At each study visit, the Inv estigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
The Investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after i nformed 
consent is obtained until the week -[ADDRESS_384670]'s participation in the study, will be followed until any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves  
• The event stab ilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to study 
conduct  
 
Page 25 of 34 • It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subj ect or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration of due 
diligence with follow -up efforts)  
All follow -up information for serious adverse events or AEs of special interest  and special situations  that 
are not resolved at the end of the study or by [CONTACT_312250], within 24 hours becoming aware , to Janssen Scientific Affairs  using Janssen Scientific Affairs’  
Serious Adverse Event Report .  
 
All ava ilable clinical information relevant to the evaluation of a related SAE,  Adverse Events of Special 
Interest,  serious ADR or special situation is required.  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_312204] -
up. A safety report is not considered complete until all clinical details needed to interpret the case 
are received. Reporting of follow -up information should follow the same timeline as initial reports.  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_312205]  (not inclu ding routine initial or follow -up ICSR 
submission) correspondences with regulatory authorities and ethics committees regarding any 
and all serious adverse events, irrespective of association with the study  drug, will be provided to 
Janssen Scientific Affai rs within  [ADDRESS_384671]’s source records. Investigators will record in the eCRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_312206]. All (serious and non -serious)  adverse events reported for the study 
drug will be followed -up in accordance with clinical practice.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_384672] be reported by [CONTACT_312251]: Prompt Reporting Requirements (HRP -801). At a minimum, events requiring reporting to the 
IRB include:  
• Any new or increased risk related to the research, including AEs or IND safety reports that require 
a change to the protocol or consent,  
• New FDA black box warning,  
• Publications identifying new risks,  
• Data Safety Monitoring Board/Committee letters recommending changes or discussing new risks  
• Unauthorized disclosure of confidential participant information  
 
8.4.2.	Reporting	to	the	 Study	 Drug	Manufacturer 	
At a minimum, on a semi -annual basis and at the end of the Study, Janssen Scientific Affairs  will provide 
to the PI, a listing of all SAEs reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_312207].  
 
 
 
The following methods will be used for transmission of safety information to Janssen Scientific Affairs : 
 
Page 26 of 34 • Electronically via Janssen SECURE Email service IIS -BIO-VIRO -[EMAIL_897]                         
(preferred)  
• For business continuity purposes, if SECURE Email is non -functional:  
o Facsimile (fax) at 1 -[PHONE_4284], receipt of which is evidenced in a successful fax 
transmission report  
o Telephone (if fax is non -functional).  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_58601] a final report including a complete and full summary of all adverse events, special 
situations and pregnancy reports according to the timeframe outlined in the agreement.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]	Safety	Event	Reporting	to	the	Study	Drug	Manufacturer 	
Safety events of interes t for a Janssen study drug that require expediting reporting and/or safety 
evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal)  
• Overdose of the study drug  
• Exposure to the study drug from breastfeeding  
• Suspect ed abuse/misuse of the study drug  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the study drug  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of the study drug  
• Medication error involving the study drug (with or without patient exposure to t he study drug, e.g., 
name [CONTACT_2976])  
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a dministration of the  study drug  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of the study drug  
 
These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse ev ent; however, from a Janssen Scientific 
Affairs  perspective, they are treated in the same manner as adverse events. Special situations should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event section  of the eCRF.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]	Non -Serious	Adverse	Event	Reporting	to	the	Study	Dr ug	Manufacturer 	
All non -serious adverse events will be reported to J anssen Scientific Affairs  annually and at the end of the 
study .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]	Serious	Adverse	Event	Reporting	to	the	Study	Drug	Manufacturer 	
Any SAE, Adverse Event of Special Interest  or speci al situation that meets the criteria of a serious 
adverse event should be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen 
Scientific Affairs  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 	PQC	Reporting	to	the	Study	Drug 	Manufacturer 	
A PQC may have an impact on the safety and efficacy of the product. Timely, accurate, and complete 
reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of patients, 
investigators, and Janssen Scientific Affair s, and are mandated by [CONTACT_67819]. 
Janssen Scientific Affairs  has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements 
worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of PQC information. Lot and/or Batch #s shall be collected or 
any reports failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect). The product should be 
quarantined immediately and if possible, take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].  
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_384673] will provide additional 
information/form to be completed.  
 
If the defect for a Janssen study drug under study is combined with either a serious adverse event or non -
seriou s adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_312208].  A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for further 
investigation if requested by [CONTACT_312252]. 
 
8.4.3.	Pregnancy 	
All initial reports of pregnancy will be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event  using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, fe tal death, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, ectopic pregnancy) are considered 
serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study will be promptly withdrawn from the study and  
discontinue further study treatment.  
 
Because the effect of the Janssen study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male 
subjects exposed to a Janssen study drug will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_384674] throughout the study. Concomitant medications will be 
recorded at every study visit. Vital signs including blood pressure and pulse (measured a minimum of 5 
minutes after resting), and weight/ BMI will be recorded at every study visit. Laboratory testing will be 
performed  at the screening visit  that will include screening for HIV, HVB, HCV , and tuberculosis  as 
detailed in the exclusion criteria. Baseline, week -4, week -12, and week -24 laboratory testing will include 
complete blood counts with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel.  
 
Subjects will be encouraged to report any potential problems at any time to qualified research staff or PI. 
The occurrence of adverse events will be assessed  at each study visit and details including diagnosis, 
severity, possibility of relationship to the study drug, and action taken will be recorded in the eCRF .  
 
Data s afety monitoring will involve real -time review of adverse events (AE), dropouts, complaint s or 
breaches of confidentiality. The review of AEs will be performed by [CONTACT_978] ( [CONTACT_312264] ) in real time, with 
review by a co-Investigator if [CONTACT_312264] is unavailable .  The study will be halted if one or more 
unexpected AEs occur that are at least po ssibly related and determined to be moderate in severity or 
greater.  
 
Data collected during study visits will be entered into the REDCap database by [CONTACT_312253]. The PI, who has no finan cial conflict of interest with 
Janssen  Scientific Affairs , will review the data at least monthly.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_312209], both serious and non -serious, in report format  to Janssen Scientific 
Affairs.  However, in certain circumstances more frequent provision of safety data may be necessary, e.g. 
to fulfill a regulatory request, and as such the data shall be made available within a reasonable time  frame 
at Janssen Scientific Affairs’  request.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_384675] s with psoriasis  are outlined below . The full package insert is publicly available.  
• Guselkumab  may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials, use of guselkumab  was 
associated with a higher rate of infe ction than the placebo group (23% ve rsus 21 %). Upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], gastroenteritis, tinea infections, and herpes simplex infections 
occurred more frequently in the guselkumab group than in the placebo group . The rate of serious 
infections was <1% and the same in the guselkuma b and placebo groups.  
• The rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_312210] 6% over one year of 
treatment. It is uncertain whether this may lead to a loss of efficacy of the study drug over time.  
• Injection site reactions including pain, ery thema, bruising, and inflammation occurred in 4.5% of 
subjects who used guselkumab (versus 2.8% of the placebo group).  
• Subjects taking guselkumab had a slightly higher rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_312211] (4.6% vs 3.3% of 
placebo), arthralgias (2.7% versus 2.1% of placebo), and diarrhea (1.6% versus 0.9% of 
placebo).  
• Elevated liver enzymes were reported more frequently in the guselkumab  group (2.6%) t han in 
the placebo group (1.9%) . 
• Adverse reactions that occurred in <1% of the study drug group but at a higher rate than place 
include migraine, candida infections, and urticaria.  
The risk to the fetus or infant in pregnant or lactating women is unknown and this is an exclusion criterion 
from the study. Women who may become pregnant and men who may father a child are as ked to use a 
reliable form of birth control. There have been no reports to date of harm and no negative effects in 
laboratory animals. There may be additional drug side effects that are not yet known.  
 
Risks of blood draw include discomfort, and a small ch ance of bleeding,  bruising,  infection , or fainting . 
 
Risks of biopsy include allergic reaction to the local anesthetic (1 in 10,000 risk), infection, bleeding, and 
scar.  
 
Risks of genetic testing include the loss of confidentiality that may affect the subj ect’s ability to obtain life 
insurance, disability insurance, or long -term care insurance. Even though there are certain genetic 
discrimination and confidentiality protections in both Oregon law and federal law, there is still a small 
chance that the subje ct could be harmed if a release occurred.  
 
Although medical information and medical photographs will be encoded and carefully protected, there is a 
small risk of loss of confidentiality and release of personal information.  
 
8.7. Participant Discontinuation  of Study Drug or Withdrawal from the Study  
8.7.1.	Participant	Discontinuation	of	Study	Drug 	
A subject who discontinues study drug administration will not be automatically withdrawn from the study if 
they discontinue study drug administrations before the e nd of the study drug administration period.  If a 
subject discontinues study drug before w eek-24, the week -[ADDRESS_384676]'s study drug must be discontinued if:  
 
Page 29 of 34 • The investig ator believes that for safety reasons or tolerability reasons (e.g.,  AE) it is in the best 
interest of the subject to discontinue study drug  
• The subject becomes pregnant or plans a pregnancy within the study period.  
• The subject (or the subject’s represent ative) withdraws consent for administration of study drug.  
• The subject develops a systemic opportunistic infection.  
• The subject is deemed ineligible according to the following TB screening criteria:  
o A diagnosis of active or latent TB is made.  
o A subject has  symptoms suggestive of active TB based on follow -up assessment 
questions and physical examination, or has had recent close contact [CONTACT_4490] a person with 
active TB, and cannot or will not continue to undergo additional evaluation.  
• The subject develops an alle rgic reaction resulting in bronchospasm with wheezing or dyspnea 
that requires ventilatory support. In general, discontinuation of study drug administration must be 
considered for subjects who develop a severe allergic reaction.  
• The subject has a reaction resulting in myalgia or arthralgia with fever or rash (suggestive of 
serum sickness and not representative of signs and symptoms of other recognized clinical 
syndromes) occurring 1 to 14 days after an injection of study drug. These may be accompanied 
by [CONTACT_312254], facial, hand, or lip edema, dysphagia, urticaria, sore throat, and 
headache.  
• The subject has a malignancy , not including cutaneous squamous cell skin cancer  < 2 cm in 
diameter or basal cell skin cancers that are adequately t reated with n o evidence of residual 
disease . 
• The subject has any severe infection (NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 or higher) that is considered related 
to the study drug by [CONTACT_20603] . 
Discontinuation of study drug will also be strongly considered  if the subject develops a serious infection, 
including but not limited to sepsis or pneumonia , or any other serious AE at the direction of the 
investigator or the subject’s request. .  
 
If a subject suffers any injury and/or damage from this research project through the f ault of the Oregon 
Health & Science University, its officers or employees, they will have the right to bring legal action against 
the University to recover the damage done subject to the limitation and conditions of the Oregon Tort 
Claims Act.  
 
8.7.[ADDRESS_384677] will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Death  
• Investigator  decision (e.g., participating in any other clinical study with an investigational agent)  
When a subject withdraws before completing the stu dy, the reason for withdrawal will  be documented in 
the eCRF . Additional subjects may be enrolled to ensure the protocol -specified number of participants 
complete the study.  If a subject withdraws after the first dose of study drug and before w eek-24, the 
week -[ADDRESS_384678] is willing a nd able 
to participate.  If the reason for withdrawal is withdrawal of consent then no additional assessments will be 
performed.  
 
 
Page 30 of 34 9.	DATA	HANDLING	 &	MANAGEMENT	RESPONSIBILITIES 	
9.1. Participant & Data Confidentiality  
The information obtained during the cond uct of this clinical study is confidential, and unless otherwise 
noted, disclosure to third parties is prohibited . Information contained within this study will be maintained in 
accordance with applicable laws protecting participant privacy, including the p rovisions of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_58404](s) and study team. This 
confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biolo gical samples  in addition to the clinical information 
relating to participants. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information 
generated will be held in strict confidence.  
Representatives of the IRB or manufacturer supplying study produc t may inspect all documents and 
records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to, medical records (office, 
clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit 
access to such records.  
Upon enrollment, participants will be assigned a code that will be used instead of their name, medical 
record number or other personally identifying information. Electronic files for data analysis will contain 
only the participant code. Codes will not contain any part of the 18 HIPAA identifiers (e.g., initials, DOB, 
MRN). The key associating the codes and the participants’ personally identifying information will be 
restricted to the Investigator and study staff. The key will be kep t secure on a  restricted OHSU network 
drive  in a limited access folder.  
The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_21225]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be ke pt in a secure location for as 
long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_38079].  
 
9.2. Data Collection & Storage: Privacy, Confidentiality & 
Security  
9.2.[ADDRESS_384679] institutional practices will be followed as described in the 
OHSU’s Information Security Directives  to maintain the confidentiality and security of data collected in this 
study. Study staff will be trained with rega rd to these procedures.  
9.2.2 .	Data	Confidentiality 	
Loss of participant confidentiality is a risk of participation. Efforts will be made to keep study participant 
identities confidential except as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Participants’ samples will be identified b y code only. 
Specifically, each consenting participant will be assigned a unique coded identifier consisting of numbers. 
This identifier will be associated with the participant throughout the duration of their participation in the 
trial. The coded identifi er will also be used to identify any participant specific samples.  
9.2.3 .	Data	Storage 	
Basic accrual tracking information (demographic, consent, visit information) will be captured in OHSU’s 
electronic clinical information research system (eCRIS), hosted o n OHSU secure servers and managed 
by [CONTACT_54830]’s information technology group at their data center in downtown Portland, Oregon. Any 
additional printed documents containing participant identifiers, such as those from the medical record to 
confirm eligibility, w ill be filed in binders and kept in a locked, secure location.  
Study outcome data will be captured in electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an electronic data 
capture (EDC) system (REDCap) on OHSU secure servers, which facilitates information being st ored in a 
 
Page [ADDRESS_384680] birth date and visit dates , email (to be used for REDCap surveys)  and city of residence . The REDCap  
system is password protected and e ncrypted with role -based security, and administered by [CONTACT_312255]. All users of the database are assigned a unique ID, username, and 
password and must complete training appropriate to their role before they are authorized to e nter, access, 
and store data in the database.  
Data from correlative studies will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_127896]. All other 
electronic data extracts will be stored only on OHSU computers and restricted drives, limited only to stu dy 
investigators and staff with authorization to access the data.  
Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential and 
disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Research materials obtained specifica lly for the purposes of this 
study will include biopsies for mechanistic studies and blood tests for CBC, CMP,  HIV, HBV, HCV,  
tuberculosis,  and measuring levels of inflammation . Saliva will be collected for  genetic testing. All 
samples used for mechanistic  testing will be coded and blinded to the investigator. Data regarding 
medical history and symptom questionnaires will be obtained during the course of this study. Absolute 
confidentiality will be maintained. Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_312212]. All data not 
stored in REDCap are stored in locked compartments and are not released without consent of the 
participants. If data are u sed in scientific presentations or publications, individuals are never identified. 
Medical information gathered during the course of the study may be given to the participant’s medical 
team and all appropriate medical personnel responsible for the particip ant’s welfare.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_384681]	(Epic) 	
An Epic research encounter will be created for each  in-person  visit or at the time of any SAE . A brief 
S.O.A.P. note that includes study drug administration will be entered into E pic to facilitate communication 
with the subject’s other healthcare providers.  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_384682]’s study number  and visit number , and kept on the cloud file storage solution provided by [CONTACT_312256].com.  
For purposes of publication or education  (i.e., viewing by [CONTACT_312257]) , any 
identifying features such as the eyes , jewelry,  or a tattoo will be digitally blocked out of the photo.  
 
9.2.6.	Telemedicine	Platform 	
The study will use a HIPAA -compliant videoconferencing platform ( Nexus/Cisco Meeting) . A one -time-use 
unique hyper link will be sent to the study subject for each visit, via OHSU MyChart  or email . No protected 
health information will be stored unless it is deliberately captured and downloaded by [CONTACT_312258]. For convenience, we will choose a platform that works 
natively within a browser with the use of static plugins and that allows patie nts to access the study “room” 
via a specific URL without need for preregistration . The platform will use standard audio/video capabilities 
and will allow access through mobile devices.      
 
10.	ETHICS/PROTECTION	OF	PARTICIPANTS 	
10.1. Ethical Standard  
The Investigator will ensure that this study is  conducted in adherence with the protocol and International 
Conference on Harmoniz ation Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH -GCP).  
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_384683]  be obtained 
before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_118694]. All changes to the consent form will be IRB 
approved; a determination will be made r egarding whether previously consented participants need to be 
re-consented.  
 
10.3. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants participating in this trial, as stated in the 
Informed Consent  section of 21 CFR Part 50 . Documentation of the consent process and a copy of the 
signed consent shall be maintained in the participant’s medi cal record.  
 
10.4. Consent Procedures and Documentation  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreement to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s st udy participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families as appropriate. Consent 
forms will be IRB -approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the docu ment. The 
Investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All 
participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, 
procedures, and potential risks/be nefits of the study, alternatives to participation, and of their rights as 
research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form 
and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have the oppor tunity to discuss the study with 
their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may 
withdraw conse nt at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the informed consent document 
will be given to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be 
protected by [CONTACT_312259].  
 
10.5. Protocol Review  
The protocol and informed consent form for this study must be reviewed and approved in writing by [CONTACT_312260].   
 
10.6. Changes to Protocol  
Any modification of this protocol must be documented in the form of a protocol revision or amendment 
submitted by [CONTACT_312261], then  approved by 
[CONTACT_1201], before the revision  or amendment may be implemented.  The only circumstance in which the 
amendment may be initiated without regulatory approval is for a change necessary to eliminate an 
apparent and immediate hazard to the participant.  In that event, the Investigator must n otify the IRB 
within [ADDRESS_384684] ered in the ClinicalTrials.gov website. This registration will occur after IRB 
approval.

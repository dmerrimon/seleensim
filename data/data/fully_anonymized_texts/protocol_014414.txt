3 Synopsis 
Study Description  
The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) develop the components of a behavioral 
economics strategy (i.e., healthy bundle defaults) to influence  diet behaviors; 2) 
characterize the online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911527] -income adults 
nationally; and 3) examine the extent to which "healthy bundles defaults" and other behavioral economic strategies increase fruit and vegetable purchases among low -income 
adults in an online randomized controlled experiment.  
The figure below shows the flow of our aims. To accomplish Aim 1, we will develop the components for the bundles in our online experiment, using publically -available data from 
the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). To 
accomplish Aim 2, we will use an online survey that we have already developed (and 
uploaded to Research Navigator). The survey will be administered to 2,692 participants, 
whom we will re
cruit through CloudResearch. After completing the online survey, the same 
participants will be randomized into one of four conditions and then participate in our experimental study (Aim 3) by [CONTACT_18943] a link and simulating a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911528] a web-
based supermarket platform developed by [CONTACT_911576].  
 
Overall, the research study will occur over 5 years (see timeline below). The development 
of the bundles and the web- based supermarket will occur in Year 1; data collection will 
occur in Years 2- 4; data analysis will occur in Year 4; and Year 5 will involve development 
of manuscripts and dissemination activities. There will be no interaction with participants in Years 1 and 5.

Objectives 
Our primary objectives are to capture behaviors and attitudes related to online grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911529] -income American adults; and examine the extent to which different 
behavioral economic strategies influence fruit and vegetable purchases of low -income 
adults in a web- based supermarket. Our secondary objective is to examine whether the 
impact of our different behavioral economic strategies differs by [CONTACT_551], gender, and race/ethnicity.  
Endpoints  
The endpoints for the online survey will be 1) whether participants report shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911530], and 2) whether participants report consuming at least 5 daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Among those who shop online for groceries, we will estimate the frequency of online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], types of groceries purchased online, types of online 
retailers, and methods of delivery; and amount ($ and %) spent on online grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911531]- store grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911532]. We will also 
calculate the frequency (%) of reasons that participants choose as motivating or 
preventing them  from purchasing groceries online (e.g., price, quality). 
The endpoint for the intervention is the proportion of real dollars spent on total fruit and vegetables per basket (i.e., shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911533]) across conditions.  
Study Population  
The study population is a sample of low -income adults aged >[ADDRESS_1280402] geographies.  
Accrual Ceiling  
We require 158 participants in each of the four arms (total n=632) to adequately power our analysis. This sample size provides power to detect a 9% difference between any 
experimental condition and controls. To allow examination of potential interaction effects 

 
Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
5 by [CONTACT_101950], we plan a total sample si ze of 2,692 participants (the rule 
of thumb that four times the sample size is needed to assess interactions compared to 
main effects requires us to enroll at least 2,528 participants). The number of persons found to be ineligible during screening is unknown.  
Phase 
Not applicable.  
Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants  
We propose to recruit our sample through CloudResearch, an online research company 
that recruits volunteer research participants from dozens of online panel providers. This means that people navigated to the panel website, created an account, and verified their 
desire to participate in studies by [CONTACT_911577]. Participants who join a 
panel have the option to unsubscribe at any time. When a study starts in the field, CloudResearch uses an assignment process to match participants with surveys they are likely to be eligible for and complete, with proprietary quality control procedures to ensure 
participants do not take the same survey twice. To reduce selection bias associated with 
the topic of the survey, invitations do not include specific details of the survey. Participants who complete CloudResearch's online surveys receive points that can be redeemed for various incentives, including cash, lotteries, or donations to charity. We have approval from NYU Medical Center Information Technology (MCIT) to use CloudResearch for 
recruitment.  
We will use Qualtrics to create and distribute the survey.  
We will also use Cauldron Science Ltd., which provides subscribers with access to their 
web-based tool “Gorilla”. “Gorilla” allows researchers to plan, design, and carry out online 
psychology experiments for research purposes, including a supermarket platform. The platform is already built and we have a license to use it for our experiment, with approval from the NIH, approval from NYU Medical Center Info rmation Technology (MCIT), and a 
fully executed contract via the NYU legal office.  
Description of Study Intervention  
The people participating in the study will complete an online survey about what factors 
motivate or prevent them from shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911530]. After completing the survey, 
all participants will participate in an online randomized controlled experiment. At the end of the survey, participants will be directed to click the link to our web- based supermarket and 
to emulate a typi[INVESTIGATOR_911534]. Participants will be asked to 
simulate one grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911535] a web- based supermarket and to select a typi[INVESTIGATOR_911536]'s worth of food for their household, including fruits and vegetables. Participants will be randomized to one of four conditions. To mimic existing double- dollar incentive 
 
Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
6 programs, participants randomized to receive discounts will receive half -off qualifying fruits 
and vegetables. The discount will be applied directly to participants' online shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911537]. Participants randomized to healthy bundle defaults with no 
discount will be offered a bundle of food and beverage items pre -loaded in their online 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_160102] (i.e., a healthy default). This bundle will be determined by [CONTACT_4317]’ 
answers to two questions in the online survey asking which fruits and beverages they 
purchase most often. Participants randomized to healthy bundle defaults plus a discount will receive a half -off discount on an identical tailored bundle. Participant s will be allowed 
to remove the bundle from their shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_160102]. Prior to shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], participants will be given instructions regarding the discount and/or bundles. 
Study Duration  
The study will last [ADDRESS_1280403] udy will take a total of 
20-30 minutes to complete. Participants randomized to receive discounts will receive half -
off qualifying fruits and vegetables. Participants may participate in the study at any time of day. 
Schema

8 2 - Introduction 
2.1 Study Rationale  
The successful completion of the proposed research may highlight which issues related to 
online shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911541]; and for whom these changes would have the greatest impact.  
 
2.2 Background  
Dietary behaviors play a critical role in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_911542] k factors, including 
obesity, weight gain, and blood glucose levels. (1) Diets rich in energy, added sugars, and 
saturated fat, and low in whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables, are positively associated 
with risk of excess adiposity, higher BMI, and increased risk of poor cardiovascular health. 
(2)  (3)  (4)  In conjunction with decreased consumption of energy -dense foods, increased 
fruit and vegetable consumption has been shown to prevent obesity and weight gain. (5)  However, low -income adults consume fewer fruits and vegetables and have poorer diet 
quality scores than higher income adults. (6)  (7)  
 
Previous research has shown that food affordability and access to fast food restaurants and 
supermarkets are linked to obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, 
(8)  (9)  likely via poor dietary behaviors and excess energy intake. (1)  In particular, 
disparities in food affordability and healthy food access contributes to inadequate intake of healthy foods among low -income adults. ( 10)  Low -income adults often live on fixed budgets 
and spend a greater proportion of their income on food than those in higher -income 
households. (11)  Further, access to supermarkets and healthy food is lower — and 
availability of energy -dense foods and fast food restaurants is higher — in low -income 
neighborhoods. (12)  Therefore, interventions to increase the affordability and accessibility of healthy foods may help improve diet behaviors in low -income adults.  
 
To address disparities in the cost of healthy foods and increase the purchasing power of 
low-income adults, the [LOCATION_002] Department of Agriculture (USDA) also offers financial 
assistance through food assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program. In 2016, SNAP served a monthly average of about 
44.2 million people in 21.8 low -income households. (13)  Recent studies have found that 
SNAP participation is associated with a decrease in food insecurity as well as reduced 
health care spending among low -incom e adults. (14)  (15)  However, household participation 
in SNAP is associated with lower HDL cholesterol, elevated fasting glucose, and metabolic 
syndrome. (16)  Research also suggests that adult SNAP participants purchase fewer 
vegetables, fruits, and whole grains than lower income nonparticipants; (17)  and purchase 
 
Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
9 more total calories, sodium, and sugars. (18)  Therefore, it is critical to evaluate potential 
policy proposals that promote healthy diet behaviors in SNAP households.  
In select geographies, low- income consumers participating in SNAP are able to use their 
SNAP benefits in online transactions with participating retailers. (19)  According to the Pew 
Research Center, internet use has increased by 74% and 89% in the past decade among 
U.S. adults, with higher overall use among younger age groups. (20)  Though absolute 
levels of internet use are lower for low -income consumers relative to higher income 
consumers, internet use increased by 27% between 2008 (54%) and 2018 (81%) among those with an annual income below $30,000. (20)  Though most adults in the U.S. still visit a 
brick -and-mortar store to buy groceries at least once a week, (21)   online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911543]. For example, a recent survey indicated that approximat ely 
20% of consumers who are responsible for grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911544] "at least occasionally" in 2018. (22)  However, little is known about 
online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911527] -income adults nationally.  
The growth in online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911545] a promising opportunity to tailor healthy eating 
interventions to online food retail environments. Unlike most brick -and-mortar food stores, 
online groceries can be ordered at any time of the day and can be delivered to consumers' homes. Home delivery is a key benefit to low -income adults living in areas with limited 
access to healthy foods (i.e., food deserts). Online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911546], including few opportunities to plan and susceptibility to in -store marketing cues, which may lead to impulse purchases. (23)  (24)  
(25)  Relative to brick -and-mortar stores, it is easier to modify the design of online 
environments to influence consumer decisi on-making (e.g., default shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911533]). On 
the other hand, online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911547]. Exposure to unhealthy foods and beverages may be higher due to online retailers targeting products to consumers using personal information or previous purchase data. In addition, some grocery 
retailers may not deliver to low -income neighborhoods, and low -income consumers may not 
have regular internet access.  This study will make a significant contribution by [CONTACT_911578][INVESTIGATOR_911548] a national sample of low -income adults.  
Interventions informed by [CONTACT_911579], low -cost ways that honor individual preferences. (26)  
According to  Thaler and Sunstein, nudges are "any aspect of the choice architecture that 
alters behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing 
their economic incentives". Nudges leverage behavioral heuristics and biases based on the 
psychology of decision- making to change shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911549]. For example, people are 
highly susceptible to the status quo bias, (27)  or the preference for inaction and for things to stay the same. One way to leverage this bias to promote health is to change default options in the environment so that people are defaulted into healthy choices, but can opt out of them if they desire. Default options have been shown to increase participation in organ donation in 
opt-out countries, (28)  and increase orders of healthy foods in restaurants with healthy 
 
Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
10 default side items on menus (e.g., salad instead of fries). (29)  Providing subsidies for 
qualifying healthy food purchases is also a popular and effective strategy for promoting 
healthy food purchases. (30)   (31)  Though an economic strategy, subsidies may help to 
mitigate "present biased preferences," or consumers' tendency to ignore future health effects by [CONTACT_911580], (27)  and cues in the environment that elicit temptation 
(e.g., promotions). A recent review of food pricing interventions found that subsidies improve 
dietary behaviors foods, especially multicomponent interventions (e.g., subsidies combined with education). (30)  With the option to use SNAP benefits online, there are a host of opportunities to create unique behavioral nudges to increase healthy food consumption. (32)  
Recently, a laboratory -based study found that displaying discounted 'bundles' in a brick -and-
mortar grocery store led to a 15% increase in fruit and vegetable purchases. (33)  However, 
no research has focused on bundling healthy food items in online food environments, or studying the effect of adding default food items to a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_160102].  
To date, only a few studies have tested interventions aimed at encouraging consumers to purchase healthier food items in online supermarkets and results are mixed. Previous research has found that front -of-pack nutrition labels, product placement, and product 
promotions increased diet quality and promoted healthier food choices in online supermarkets, (34)  (35)  (36)  (37)  whereas healthy swaps (i.e., offering healthy 
alternatives) did not appear to affect purchases. (38)  Similarly, previous work has found that 
subsidies on healthy foods improved the nutrient quality of foods purchased in an online supermarket, (39)  though they may result in higher calories purchased overall. (35)  (38)  Both discounts and bundling may be effective strategies to promote healthy food choices 
among individuals with a fixed budget, especially in online settings where individuals are 
able to preorder and deliver groceries to their home. To our knowledge, no research has evaluated interventions designed to promote healthier online food purchases among low -
income adults.  
 
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1280405] instead of delivering their shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911550]. As described above, the lottery is used to incentivize participation and truthful responses and this approach will mitigate potential issues related to delivery and avoid complications associated with changing grocery stock items. It is important that the participant thinks they are actually getting the groceries because it will encourage 
participants to provide truthful answers; whereas, knowledge of getting a gift card might 
result in participants making choices that do not reflect their actual preferences. We also anticipate that participants would prefer money they can spend on anything, rather than being restricted to grocery items.

Thus, we assess that the benefits outweigh the risks.

12 3 - Objectives and Endpoints  
3.1 Objectives and Endpoi nts 
Our primary objectives are to capture behaviors and attitudes related to online grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911529] -income American adults; and examine the extent to which different 
behavioral economic strategies influence fruit and vegetable purchases of low -income adults 
in a web- based supermarket. Our secondary objective is to examine whether the impact of 
our different behavioral economic strategies differs by [CONTACT_551], gender, and race/ethnicity.  
The endpoints for the online survey will be 1) whether parti cipants report shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911551], and 2) whether participants report consuming at least 5 daily servings of 
fruits and vegetables. Among those who shop online for groceries, we will estimate the frequency of online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], types of groceries purchased online, types of online retailers, and methods of delivery; and amount ($ and %) spent on online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911552]- store grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911532]. We will also calculate 
the frequency (%) of reasons that  participants choose as motivating or preventing them from 
purchasing groceries online (e.g., price, quality). 
The endpoint for the intervention is the proportion of real dollars spent on total fruit and 
vegetables per basket (i.e., shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911533]) across conditions.

13 4 - Study Design  
4.1 Overall Design  
This research study includes three aims (see figure below), though only Aim 2 and Aim 3 
involve human subjects. The duration of the study is 5 years.  
 
In Aim 1, we will develop the components of healthy bundle defaults (i.e., preloaded cart 
items) using publically available data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), the literature, and expert advice. Specifically, we will measure 
the frequency of food and beverage purchases in FoodAPS, to enable us to determine the 
most frequent healthy food purchases by [CONTACT_17203] (e.g., fruits, vegetables) among low -
income households by [CONTACT_911581], gender, and race/ethnicity. Thes e healthy bundle 
defaults will be used in Aim 3, specifically the arms with healthy bundle defaults. The 
development of the bundles will occur in Year 1. Aim 1 does not involve human subjects 
research.  
In Aim 2, we will recruit 2,692 low -income adults aged  >18 years from a nationwide 
nonprobability panel via CloudResearch and administer an online survey to characterize 
participants' online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911553]. After completing the online survey, we will randomize all participants from Aim 2 to one of four conditions, including 1) 
no intervention, 2) discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, 3) healthy bundle defaults with 
no discount, and 4) healthy bundle defaults plus a discount.  
In Aim 3, participants will click a link and simulate a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911554] a 
week's worth of SNAP -eligible groceries for their household in a web- based supermarket 
platform. We will also use Cauldron Science Ltd., which provides subscribers with access to their web- based tool “Gorilla”. “Gorilla” allows researchers to plan, design, and carry out 
online psychology experiments for research purposes, including a supermarket platform. The platform is already built and we have a license to use it for our experiment, with approval 

 
Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
14 from the NIH, approv al from NYU Medical Center Information Technology (MCIT), and a fully 
executed contract via the NYU legal office.  
We will examine the impact of our behavioral economic strategies on the proportion of real 
dollars spent on total fruits and vegetables per online shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_829765]. We will also explore whether the impact of our intervention on food purchases differs by [CONTACT_835444].

15 5 - Study Population  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
The inclusion criteria include: 1) aged 18- 99 years; 2) ability to read and speak English; 3) 
have ever received SNAP benefits, 4) live with fewer than 5 people; and 5) access to a 
personal computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.  
 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria  
The exclusion criteria include: 1) aged <18 years or >99 years; 2) lack the ability to read and 
speak English; 3) have never received SNAP benefits, 4) live with 5 or more people; and/or 5) do not have access to  a personal computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone. 
 
5.3 Lifestyle Considerations  
There will be no restrictions during any parts of the study pertaining to lifestyle and/or diet. 
 
5.4 Screen Failures  
Screen failures include those who do not meet all of our inclusion criteria. Potential 
participants will answer four pre- screening questions to determine their eligibility. The pre -
screening questions include those related to 1) age; 2) the ability to read and speak English; 3) receipt of SNAP benefits (ever), and 4) the number of household members (we do not explicitly ask about access to a personal computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone, since 
they are using Qualtrics to access our survey, which requires access to such devices). If 
they do not meet our inclusion criteria, these subjects will see the text "Thank you for your time, but unfortunately, you are not eligible for this study."  
Re-screening is not applicable.  
 
5.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
We propose to recruit our sample through CloudResearch, an online research company that 
recruits volunteer research participants from dozens of online providers. This means that 
people navigated to the panel website, created an account, and verified their desire to participate in studies by [CONTACT_911577]. CloudResearch uses an assignment process to match participants with surveys they are likely to be eligible for and complete, 
with proprietary quality control procedures to ensure participants do not take the same 
survey twice. To reduce selection bias associated with the topic of the survey, invitations do not include specific details of the survey. Participants who complete CloudResearch's online surveys receive points that can be redeemed for various incentives, including cash, l otteries, 
or donations to charity. We have approval from NYU Medical Center Information Technology 
 
Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
16 (MCIT) to use CloudResearch for recruitment. The online survey is already developed (and 
uploaded to Research Navigator).  
To incentivize participation and truthful responses, we will also notify participants prior to the 
experiment that they are automatically entered into a lottery to have the items in their shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911556].  
 
[ADDRESS_1280408] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711]'s worth of food for their household and 
assume they need to buy the most important things, including the fruits and vegetables they 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_911557]. Participants will be randomized to one of four conditions. To mimic existing double- dollar incentive programs, participants randomized to receive discounts will receive 
half-off qual ifying fruits and vegetables. The discount will be applied directly to participants' 
online shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911558]. Participants randomized to healthy bundle defaults with no discount will be offered a bundle of food and beverage items p re-loaded in 
their online shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_160102] (i.e., a healthy default). This bundle will be determined by [CONTACT_4317]’ answers to two questions in the online survey asking which fruits and 
beverages they purchase most often. Participants randomized to healthy bundle defaults 
plus a discount will receive a half -off discount on an identical tailored bundle. Participants will 
be allowed to remove the bundle from their shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_160102]. Prior to shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], participants will be given instructions regarding the discount and/or bundles.  
We will recruit a nationwide non probability  panel of 2,692 low -income adults >18 years 
through CloudResearch, an online surveying company that recruits volunteer research 
participants through their online panels and other online communities. Participants who complete CloudResearch's online surveys receive points that can be redeemed for various incentives, including cash, lotteries, or donations to charity. Potential participants will click 
the link for our online study and complete an online consent. After providing consent, 
potential participants will complete four pre- screening questions to determine their eligibility. 
The pre -screening questions include those related to 1) age; 2) the ability to read and speak 
English; 3) receipt of SNAP benefits (ever), and 4) the number of household members (we 
do not explicitly ask about access to a personal computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone, 
since they are using Qualtrics  to access our survey, which requires access to such devices). 
All quest ions in the survey, including the pre -screening questions, will be completed on a 
personal computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone and will take approximately 10- 15 
 
Study Number: s20- [ADDRESS_1280409] a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711]'s worth of food for their household, including fruits 
and vegetables, which will take an additional 10- [ADDRESS_1280410] with the equivalent amount of money loaded 
onto it that they spent in the study (rather than having the groceries delivered). This 
approach will mitigate potential issues related to delivery and avoid complications associated 
with changing grocery stock items. We also anticipate that participants would prefer money they can spend on anything, rather than being restricted to grocery items. CloudResearch 
will also debrief participants about the purpose of the study,  including the justification for 
providing lottery winners a gift card instead of groceries. The participants who do not win the 
lottery will also be debriefed.  
After completing the online survey, we will randomize all participants from Aim 2 to one of 
four conditions, including 1) no intervention, 2) discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, 3) healthy bundle defaults with no discount, and 4) healthy bundle defaults plus a discount. All 
participants will answer the same set of questions in the online survey on Qualtrics. After 
clicking the link to access the web- based supermarket platform on the “Gorilla” platform, 
participants will be randomized to one of the four experimental conditions outlined in Aim 3. The “Gorilla” platform has a randomization function built into its design. No blinding will be 
done.  
Adherence to the protocol will be assessed by [CONTACT_911582] 
"checking out" of our online grocery store with a minimum of two items in the cart (no payment will be taken).

than being restricted to grocery items.  
 
7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
The participants are allowed to withdraw from the online survey and online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911560], with no penalty.

Study Number: s20- [ADDRESS_1280413] the working hypothesis that the likelihood of shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911561], White, and younger; and that adults who shop online will 
have higher adjusted odds of consuming at least 5 daily servings of fruits and vegetables than those who do not shop online. We also hypothesize that participants exposed to healthy bundle defaults plus a discount will spend more on fruits and vegetables than 
controls; and that the effect size will be larger relative to arms with only discounts  or only 
bundles.  
 
9.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Based on previous work (40), we require 158 participants in each of the four arms (total 
n=632) to adequately power our analysis. This sample size provides power to detect a 9% difference between any experimental condition and controls. To allow examination of 
potential interaction effects by [CONTACT_101950], we plan a total sample size of 
2,692 participants (the rule of thumb that four times the sample size is needed to assess interactions compared to main effects requires us to enroll at least 2,528 participants).

For Aim 2, we will report our results using averages and standard deviations, or median and 
interquartile range. In exploratory analyses, we will use logistic regression to compare 
differences between groups, adjusting for relevant covariates. To determine whether the distribution of demographics is equivalent between our groups of comparison, we will use independent samples T -tests and Chi -square tests. We will do the same for comparing the

20 FoodAPS sample. We will use a two- sided alpha of 0.05 as the threshold for statistical 
significance.  
For Aim 3, we will perform a linear regression to assess balance of demographic 
characteristics across the four study conditions; because of randomization, these charac teristics should be balanced. To assess differences in the proportion of real dollars 
spent on total fruits and vegetables across experimental conditions, we will regress the outcome variable on indicator variables for the experimental conditions, with the control 
condition as the reference group; if necessary, we will also adjust for any respondent characteristics that may be unbalanced by [CONTACT_3004]. We will test for potential interaction 
effects by [CONTACT_551], gender, and race/ethnicity. We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis 
excluding participants who report that they would never consider shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911563]. The design and methods proposed will achieve robust and unbiased results because a randomized controlled experiment is a gold standard  approach.

Study Number: s20- [ZIP_CODE]  December 16 , 2021  
 
21 9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The primary outcome for Aim 1 is the healthy food item per category (fruits and vegetables) 
purchased most often per subgroup by [CONTACT_911581] (1- 4 persons), gender (female, male), 
and race/ethnicity (Black, Hispanic/Latino, White). We will measure the frequency of food 
and beverage purchases in FoodAPS, to enable us to determine the most frequent healthy 
food purchases by [CONTACT_17203] (e.g., fruits, vegetables) among low -income households by 
[CONTACT_911581], gender, and race/ethnicity.  
The primary outcomes for Aim 2 will be 1) whether participants report shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911565], and 2) whether participants report consuming at least 5 daily servings of fruits and 
vegetables. Among those who shop online for groceries, we will estimate the frequency of online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], types of groceries purchased online, types of online retailers, and methods of delivery; and amount ($ and %) spent on online grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911566]- store grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911532]. We will also calculate the frequency 
(%) of reasons that participants choose as motivating or preventing them from purchasing 
groceries onli ne (e.g., price, quality).  We will report our results using averages and standard 
deviations, or median and interquartile range. In exploratory analyses, we will use logistic 
regression to compare differences between groups, adjusting for relevant covariates. To 
determine whether the distribution of demographics is equivalent between our groups of comparison, we will use independent samples T- tests and Chi -square tests. We will do the 
same for comparing the distribution of demographics and grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911567]. We will use a two- sided alpha of 0.05 as the 
threshold for statistical significance.  
The primary outcome for Aim 3 is the proportion of real dollars spent on total fruit and vegetables per basket (i.e.,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_911533]) across conditions. We will perform a linear 
regression to assess balance of demographic characteristics across the four study 
conditions; because of randomization, these characteristics should be balanced. To assess 
differences in the proportion of real dollars spent on total fruits and vegetables across 
experimental conditions, we will regress the outcome variable on indicator variables for the experimental conditions, with the control condition as the reference group; if necessary, w e 
will also adjust for any respondent characteristics that may be unbalanced by [CONTACT_3004]. The design and methods proposed will achieve robust and unbiased results because a randomized controlled experiment is a gold standard approach.  
 
9.4.3 Analysis of t he Secondary Endpoint(s)  
We will test for potential interaction effects by [CONTACT_551], gender, and race/ethnicity. We will 
also conduct a sensitivity analysis excluding participants who report that they would never

10.1 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for 
the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46. The protocol, 
informed consent form(s), r ecruitment materials, and all participant materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will 
require rev iew and approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All 
changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding 
whether previously consented participants need to be re- consented.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Consent/Assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants  
The consent based on the IRB template has been uploaded to the CONSENT FORMS 
section of submission in Research Navigator.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Consent Procedures and Documentation 
Potential participants  consent to participate in CloudResearch studies when they first 
respond to a CloudResearch advertisement. Potential participants also provide consent at 
the start of each survey using a computer -based consent form. Participants will be asked to 
read a consent form on the first page of the online survey, and click "yes" to consent and 
begin the survey or "no" to end the survey. Before obtaining consent, we will inform potential 
participants of the potential risks, which are minimal because we are not collec ting 
personally identifiable information. To mitigate the risk of coercion, participants will receive compensation whether or not they complete the survey questions, and will be informed of 
this at the beginning of the survey.  
 
10.1.2 Study Discontinuation  and Closure  
The study will be terminated or temporarily suspended based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_21781], IRB decision in 
the event of an Unanticipated Problem. If an unanticipated problem is recognized, data collection will stop and any corrective action or explanation that can be given to participants experiencing this issue will be administered. Then, a modification to rectify the issue will be 
submitted to the IRB (and details sent to the sponsor if applicable) and new methods to 
avoid the problem will be used going forward. The study team will work with the IRB to ensure that any problems participants experienced prior to the change are ethically addressed. The consent process also includes text that informs the participants they can call 
or email the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21782]. We will also inform participants that

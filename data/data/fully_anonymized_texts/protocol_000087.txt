 Protocol:  
Study Objective  
PREVENT is a multicenter , randomized placebo  controlled Phase 2  trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of a pharmacologic agent : Avexitide for patients with postbariatr ic hypoglycemia 
(PBH) in the outpatient setting.  
Study design  
The PREV ENT trial was a randomized, placebo -controlled, crossover study conducted 
at five  U.S. academic centers. The study design, consisting of three 14 -day treatment 
periods. After a run -in period during which eligibility was confirmed,  18 participants with 
seve re, diet -refractory PBH were randomized 1:1 to one of two arms,  each differing in 
the order of dosing regimen. For both groups, Treatment Period 1 consisted  of 
subcutaneous placebo injections. During Treatment Periods 2 and 3, avexitide was  
administered 30  mg twice daily (BID) and 60 mg once daily (QD) in crossover design 
and random order. At the end of each treatment period, participants underwent 
standardized  mixed -meal tolerance testing (MMTT) in the clinical research unit (CRU) 
with hormonal,  metabolic,  and symptomatic assessments. Throughout, participants 
were required to  adhere to PBH dietary recommendations and document all 
hypoglycemic events in the  outpatient setting using electronic diaries (eDiaries), self -
monitoring of blood glucose  (SMBG), and b linded continuous glucose monitors (CGM).   
Participants  
Eligible participants were men or women ages [ADDRESS_304344] 12 months before screening and had a documented histor y of 
PBH defined  as Whipple ’s triad, with inappropriately elevated insulin ( ≥3 µU/mL) or C -
peptide (>0.6  ng/mL) at the time of hypoglycemia ( ≤54 mg/dL glucose).[ADDRESS_304345] 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_250376] ≤54 mg/dL while following dietary guidelines during the 
run-in period.  
Patients who had any of the following criteria were excluded from study participation:  
• history of hypoglycemia predating RYGB surgery ;  
• history of insulinoma or other cause ofendogenous hyperinsulinism;  
• clinically significant acute medical conditions;  
• pregnancy,  lactation, and/or women of childbearing potential not using effective 
contraceptive  methods;  
• and use of any agents known to interfere with glucose metab olism within [ADDRESS_304346] day of dosing. Nonchildbearin g potential was defined as 
surgical  sterility (documented hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -
oophorectomy) or  postmenopausal status (defined as 12 months of spontaneous 
amenorrhea)  
Randomization and masking  
Participants were informed that one treatment period would involve placebo injections 
and were blinded to treatment sequence and study drug composition. Participants 
received two  subcutaneous injections daily throughout all three study periods to fulfill 
blinded conditions,  with injections comprised of the appropriate combination of placebo 
and/or active avexitide  30 mg dose(s). Investigators and site staff were blinded to 
avexitide sequence during  Treatment Periods 2 and 3 and to laboratory results. For 
safety reasons, inve stigators, but  not participants, had access to point -of-care glucose 
results during the MMTTs to determine  whether glycemic rescue was indicated.  
 
Procedures  
In-clinic MMTT procedures: At the end of each treatment period, subjects were admitted 
to the CRU after an overnight fast for a 180 -minute MMTT. After a baseline blood  draw, 
subjects consumed two Ensure® Compact Drinks containing 64g of carbohydrate over  
10 minutes, with labs drawn every 15 minutes (for plasma glucose, insulin, c -peptide, 
GLP-1 and glu cagon) and bedside assessment of neuroglycopenic symptoms and 
point -of-care glucose via the HemoCue® Glucose 201 System every 30 minutes. If 
rescue parameters were  met (the earlier of point -of-care glucose ≤50 mg/dL with 
documented neuroglycopenic  symptoms  or ≤40 mg/dL irrespective of symptoms), final 
blood samples were drawn and  participants were rescued by [CONTACT_250378]. The 
primary outcome of plasma glucose  nadir was based on plasma samples assayed per 
standard methods.  
Pharmacokinetic assessments: Blood samples for the determination of plasma avexitide  
concentrations were collected at the end of each 14 -day avexitide treatment period at -
90, 0, 60, 180 and 330 min relative to the timing of study drug injection.  
At home p rocedures: Throughout all treatment periods subjects used an eDiary 
(internetconnected web application), a CONTOUR®Next One glucometer, and blinded 
Dexcom  Mobile G4® CGM for recording of hypoglycemic events occurring in the 
ambulatory setting.  
For each epi [INVESTIGATOR_1865], patients recorded hypoglycemia symptoms/signs, the lowest SMBG  
reading during the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], actions taken to treat or prevent the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], requirement 
for assistance, and whether the epi[INVESTIGATOR_250377]. Study drug injections were 
also recorded, and adherence was additionally monitored via accounting of returned 
study drug  vials.  
Page [ADDRESS_304347] -hoc according to current international 
consensus guidelines on the reporting of hypoglycemia in clinical trials,  as follows: Level 
1 hypoglycemia: SMBG<70 mg/dL; Level 2 hypoglycemia: SMBG<54 mg/dL;  Level 3 
hypoglycemia: a severe event characterized by [CONTACT_226405]/or physical  
functioning that requires assistanc e from another person for recovery.  
Exploratory  outcomes captured by [CONTACT_250379] -
hoc in  accordance with current guidance36 and included percent time above or below 
extreme  glycemic thresholds (<54 mg/dL; >250 mg/dL) and number of events <54 
mg/dL. Percent  time <54 mg/dL and number of events <54 mg/dL were also defined 
temporally by [CONTACT_250380]  (12am -8am) vs. prandial/post -prandial (8am -12am) periods; the 
latter more broadly  representing the hours during which meal -induced hypoglycemia 
may occur and accounting  for the mean 1 -2-hour delay from mealtime to glucose nadir 
observed in patients with  PBH. The pharmacokinetic profile for each dosing regimen 
was evaluated on an  exploratory basis. Safety assessments included a dverse events, 
clinical laboratory results,  and physical examination findings.  
 
Statistical Analysis  Plan 
A sample size of 12 completed patients was selected to provide more than 90% power 
to detect an increase in glucose nadir of at least 15.0 mg/dL assuming a standard 
deviation of  14.0 mg/dL at a significance level (α) of 0.[ADDRESS_304348] Squares (LS) mean, standard 
error (SE), 95%  confidence interval (CI), and p -value were derived from the mixed -effect 
model for each  active treatment. No multiplicity adjustmen t was planned, and the 
primary endpoint was  evaluated through the nominal p -values. Placebo -corrected 
secondary and exploratory  endpoint data were analyzed in the same manner as the 
primary endpoint, with the  exception of pharmacokinetic data, which were s ummarized 
descriptively.

All AEs/ SAEs and  ADEs/SADEs will be: (1) evaluated, monitored and tracked from the time of the first study 
treatment  and (2) must be recorded in AE section of the protocol specific  case report forms (CRFs) . 
Medical occurrences that begin after enrolling into the study  and before administration of study 
treatment will be recorded on the Medical History section of the CRF, not the AE section.  
 
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the I nvestigator must seek information on AEs/ADEs and SAEs /SADEs by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. AEs/ ADEs  and SAEs /SADEs may be observed by 
[CONTACT_11219]/or clinical research staff, elicited from the subject and/or family member or 
volunteered by [CONTACT_423]. All observed and volunteered adverse signs and symptom s, anticipated or 
unanticipated, regardless of severity or frequency, will be recorded in the CRFs. Included in the description 
should be the nature of the sign or symptom  (including location of the AE/ADE as applicable) , the date of 
onset, date of resolution (duration), the severity, anticipated or unanticipated, the relationship to study treatment or other therapy, the action taken (if any), and the outcome.  
 All SAEs/ SADEs, anticipated or unanticipated, must be reported  to the Sponsor  as soon as possible  (no 
later than 24 hours after occurrence ).  The SA E/SADE  must be recorded in: (1) the protocol -specific CRF 
and (2) a written report must be submitted to the Sponsor no later than  ten (10) working days after the 
Investigator first lear ns of the event. The written report shall include a full description of the event and 
sequelae, in the format detailed by [CONTACT_1034]’s  SAE/SADE  Form.   Investigator may be required to submit 
additional reports to the IRB and to the Sponsor  related to SAEs/SADEs . 
 
The Sponsor  will immediately conduct an evaluation of any S AE/SADE s per 21 CFR part 812.46(b)(1).  If 
the SA E/SA DE is determined to be a [LOCATION_003]DE, the Sponsor  will report results of such evaluation to IRB, FDA 
and participating I nvestigators pursuant to  21 CFR part 812.150(b)(1).  If the Sponsor  determines the 
[LOCATION_003]DE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the Sponsor  will termi nate the study or parts of the 
study presenting that risk pursuant to  21 CFR part 812. 46(b)(2).  
7.5 Follow -up of Subjects after AEs/ADEs 
All reported AEs/ADEs should be followed until resolution.  In the unusual circumstance that an AE/ADE 
has not resolved by [CONTACT_11220]’s completion of the study, an explanation will be entered on the appropriate C RF and the subject will be referred to his or her  primary care provider (unless specified 
otherwise by [CONTACT_456]). Resolutions of events and all events that result in permanent discontinuation from this clinical trial are to be documented on the appropriate CRFs.  
7.[ADDRESS_10710] will be followed until completion of pregnancy. 
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE/ADE.  A congenital anomaly or birth defect will be reported as an SAE.

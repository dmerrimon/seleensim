1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title: Intraoperative video laryngoscopy as adjunct for nerve monitoring
Grant Number: N/A
Study Description: The purpose of this study is to describe the impact of adding 
intraoperative video laryngoscopy (IOVL) to intra-operative laryngeal 
nerve monitoring (IOLNM) during neck procedures when IOLNM is 
routinely used, including thyroidectomy and re-operative 
parathyroidectomy. Specifically, we seek to assess how frequently the 
use of IOVL provided confirmatory or additional information that may 
affect surgeon decision-making when IOLNM alone is ambiguous, or 
when there is equipment malfunction or failure. The IOVL is a 
disposable, otherwise standard fiberoptic laryngoscope (Larynxview, 
Neurovision Medical, Ventura CA) that is inserted alongside the 
endotracheal tube following intubation for surgical procedures. It allows 
assessment of vocal cord movement in response to nerve stimulation. 
Currently, the use of IOLNM is based on audio cues, and visual 
assessment of external laryngeal muscle movement during surgery in 
response to stimulation, but no direct assessment of vocal cord 
movement is routinely possible. This information can be ambiguous and 
subject to judgement of the surgeon. The addition of IOVL provides 
direct assessment to vocal cord movement in response to stimulus, and 
may be useful in light of ambiguous IOLNM data, or limited 
visualization of external laryngeal muscles.
Objectives*:This is a descriptive study in which we seek to assess the degree to 
which intraoperative video laryngoscopy used in conjunction with 
routine intraoperative nerve monitoring provides additional data on 
nerve integrity and vocal cord function for patients undergoing neck 
procedures that place the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves at risk 
for injury or postoperative dysfunction. Specifically, we are interested in 
how frequently the information gained from video laryngoscopy may 
provide data on the vocal cord function in situations of ambiguous data 
from the nerve monitor, or in cases of equipment malfunction or failure 
of the nerve monitor. We would also like to assess the frequency of 
discordance in evaluation of intraoperative nerve monitoring, which is 
an indirect measure of vocal cord function via nerve integrity, with 
direct evaluation of vocal cord function via video laryngoscopy
Endpoints*:This is a descriptive study. There are no specific patient outcome 
endpoints. We will be primarily assessing the frequency with which the 
IOVL provides additional data to IOLNM which may be used to make 
further surgical decision making.

2.2 BACKGROUND 
Thyroid and re-operative parathyroid surgery are technically demanding surgeries involving highly 
intricate anatomy. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is the most important structure at risk during these 
procedures. The gold standard for protecting the nerve is identifying it through careful dissection before 
proceeding with the removal of the thyroid gland. The variability in the nerve's course can lead to trouble 
with identification and increase the risk of injury when surgeons are inexperienced. Although the rate of 
injury to the nerve has been reported to be relatively low—up to 6% for temporary paresis and up to 2% 
for paralysis—the consequences of injury can be devastating and thus lowering the injury rate even more 
is desirable. Data on the use of IOLNM was first published in 2001, and IOLNM has become a widely used 
adjunct for identifying the RLN and allowing real-time identification and functional assessment of the RLN 
in the operative field. It also provides information on the status of the superior laryngeal nerve status and 
function.
IOLNM is an indirect measure of vocal cord function. It provides information on nerve integrity via 
electromyography (EMG). The feedback the surgeon receives from the system is based on the amount of 
current necessary to stimulate vocal cord movement, with higher currents indicating worse signal 
transduction through the nerve, and a loss of signal indicating a severely injured or divided nerve. 
Surgeons are extrapolating vocal cord function based on auditory cues which indicate nerve integrity, as 
well as graphical information of the amplitude of the signal (known as the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_811205]), but 
do not routinely visualize vocal cord function in real time when making decisions during the procedure.
In our experience, the current system has some limitations. The nerve power index (NPI) is a value 
displayed by [CONTACT_811215], with higher numbers indicating better 
nerve conduction. The quality of conduction is audibly expressed by a two-tone system, with a higher-
pi[INVESTIGATOR_811206]
>100, and a lower-pi[INVESTIGATOR_811206] <100. Often the actual NPI [INVESTIGATOR_811207] 100,
either higher or lower, and interpretation of nerve integrity in this range is ambiguous. Direct
interpretation of vocal cord function could be of greater use to the surgeon at these times. We have also
experienced system failures, either due to a break in the small wires of the electrode leads, or computer
hardware or software malfunction, any of which can lead to the inability to use the IOLNM. In our
experience, some form of failure or malfunction of the IOLNM system occurs in 10-15% of operative cases.

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN
This will be a prospective cohort study without randomization. Patients enrolled will undergo the planned 
procedure according to our routines of care. IOLNM will be performed per our routine of care.
Additional procedures will involve the following:
1) Following consent, but prior to the operation we will complete routine in-office fiberoptic
laryngoscopy to assess baseline vocal cord function
2) Prior to intubation, the patient will receive glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg, as per typi[INVESTIGATOR_199252]-
anesthetic dosing regimen, to decrease airway and mucous membrane secretions
3) Upon intubation, the video laryngoscope will be passed under direct vision and secured alongside
the endotracheal tube. Vocal cords will be positioned in the visual field of the laryngoscope before
beginning the operation
4) Following video laryngoscopy, and initiation of the procedure, the ipsilateral vagus nerve will be
tested using nerve stimulation (per standard protocol) to ensure good distal nerve conduction
and identify potential non-recurrent laryngeal nerve anatomy
5) At all points during the procedure where intraoperative nerve monitoring is used, information
about vocal cord motion from video laryngoscopy will also be recorded. Specifically, we will record
the neuropraxia index from the nerve monitor, and whether vocal cord function in concordant
with the nueropraxia index
6) At the conclusion of resection, the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves will be assessed with
IONM, the vagus will be assessed with IONM, and lastly the vocal cords will be assessed with IOVL.
This sequence is consistent with the describe protocol for IONM for testing the vagus and
recurrent nerve prior to resection, and then again in reverse order following resection
(V1R1R2V2).
7) After conclusion of the procedure and final surgical closing, prior to extubation, vocal cord
function will again be assessed with video laryngoscopy
8) At standard 1-week and 3-month post-operative follow-up we will also perform routine fiberoptic
laryngoscopy, per common practice, to assess vocal cord function. Patients will be asked to
complete a brief questionnaire at both of these visits

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals who do not meet the 
criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that 
are likely to change over time may be rescreened. Rescreened participants will be assigned the same 
participant number as for the initial screening.
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION
We typi[INVESTIGATOR_811208] 20-25 patients per month in our endocrine surgery practice who undergo 
thyroid or re-operative parathyroid surgery in whom IOLNM is routine. Over a one-year period this would 
give us access to 200-250 patients who would meet inclusion criteria. Assuming approximately 25-50% of 
patients consent to participate, this should comfortably allow us to recruit 75-125 patients over the 
proposed study period. Based on our experience suggesting a 10-15% incidence of IOLNM system 
malfunction or failure, this should allow us 8-[ADDRESS_1122201], and Mount Sinai Beth Israel. 
Follow up visits will be at the previously described clinic locations.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS
This protocol uses the definition of adverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-
related .
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
N/A
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity. 
•Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily
activities.
•Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.
•Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.

GCO #17-2617 12/22/2021
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 14All adverse events (AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, 
assessed by [CONTACT_9152]-trained clinician based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. 
•Related – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures, there is a reasonable possibility
that the study procedures caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study
procedures and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal
relationship between the study procedures and the AE.
•Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures caused the event,
there is no temporal relationship between the study procedures and event onset, or an alternate
etiology has been established.
[IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS 
A clinician with appropriate expertise in hyperparathyroidism will be responsible for determining whether 
an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study procedures.
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.
All AEs, not otherwise precluded per the protocol, will be captured on the appropriate case report form 
(CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relationship to study procedures (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] 
a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_31233].
The study coordinator will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At

This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by [CONTACT_9155] (OHRP).  OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 16approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_572781]); and
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS REPORTING 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include 
the following information:
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project
number
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome
represents an UP
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or
are proposed in response to the UP

10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks will be given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent will be completed prior to starting the study 
intervention.  The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol: Informed Consent Form.
We do anticipate enrolling non-English speaking patients. Once this consent form is IRB approved, we will 
have it translated into Spanish and Russian and submit a modification to have these consent documents 
approved. We will also potentially enroll patients who speak other languages. However, since we do not 
expect to enroll a significant number of patients who speak any other language, we will be using the short 
form consent process to consent those patients. We will approach the IRB on a case-by-case basis to 
request a short form consent.
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION
A member of the study team identifies potential study subjects from the review of the clinic and/or 
operating room schedules of study physicians. A HIPAA waiver is being requested for access to this 
information during this pre-screening process. Potential subjects are first approached by [CONTACT_811217] a routine office visit, to asses interest in the study. If the patient expresses interest, a 
member of the study team will approach them for an informed consent process following Mount Sinai 
SOP. If patients prefer to spend extra time going over the consent form, they can also consent for 
participation immediately before the surgical procedure. However in this case, even if the patient has 
already been informed of the study they will still go through the entire document with a member of the 
research team before signing. Patients are considered to be enrolled in the study after signing the ICF.
10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided 
by [CONTACT_21224], investigator, and regulatory authorities. If 
the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform 
study participants, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and will provide the reason(s) for the 
termination or suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable.

GCO #17-2617 12/22/[ADDRESS_1122220] by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, 
and the safety and oversight monitor(s). This confidentiality is extended to the data being collected as 
part of this study. Data that could be used to identify a specific study participant will be held in strict 
confidence within the research team. No personally-identifiable information from the study will be 
released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor/funding agency. 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.
The representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), or regulatory agencies may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, 
medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.
The study participant’s contact [CONTACT_21225]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as 
long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional policies, or sponsor/funding agency 
requirements.
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will 
be transmitted to and stored on a Mount Sinai secured, shared network drive. This will not include the 
participant’s contact [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, individual participants and their research data will 
be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management 
systems used by [CONTACT_811218]. At the 
end of the study, all study databases will be de-identified and archived on a Mount Sinai secured network 
drive.
Data will be stored in the secure REDCap database. Only the study investigators will have access to the 
study data, which will be stored on a Mount Sinai secured, shared network drive. The data will be 
password protected. All paper document relating to the study will be stored in the Research Office. Data 
is always de-identified prior to data analysis. In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, subjects are not 
identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal 
identifier unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by [CONTACT_2371].
PHI will be protected in the HIPAA-compliant, secure REDCap Database.  This will be accessed by 
[CONTACT_101692]-protected, encrypted computers.
10.1.4 FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS AND DATA 
All patient identifiers will be destroyed as soon as data collection and analysis are complete. All analysis 
will be conducted on de-identified data. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_811211] a mass storage 
device, Mount Sinai’s server, for a minimum of six years after publication.

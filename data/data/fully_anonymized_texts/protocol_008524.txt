 Page 2 of 15  2) Background  / Justification For Study  
More t han 4 million adults over the age of 50 years are living with a total knee 
replacement (TKR).1 TKR utilization in the US continues to dramatically increase across 
all ages, with over 615,000 TKR completed annually.2 The number of new  TKR’s is 
expected to approach 3.48 million by 2030.3 TKR substantially increases lifetime medical 
costs and accounts for 61% of osteoarthritis- related direct medical costs.4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- based 
costs of TKR exceed $16 billion.5 With the dramatic expected rise of TKR utilization 
over the next 20 years3 and substantial burden on the economy, it is imperative to identify 
approaches to maximize the benefits of the costly treatment.   
TKR is effective at improving health -related quality of life,6 pain,7 and physical 
function8 with more than 75% of patients experiencing improvements.[ADDRESS_550421] -operative changes in 
physical activity are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_218206], with physical activity levels at 1 year after 
surgery remaining similar to pre -operative levels.10,11 Less than 5% of patients reach 
recommended physical activity guidelines after knee replacement.12,13 The continued low 
levels of physical activity a re concerning because inactivity is associated with increased 
risk of mortality14 and chronic disease,15,16 as well as lower quality of life17 and poorer 
physical function.18,19 Even though improvements are observed in pain and function, it is 
unknown why patients continue to maintain thei r pre -operative low levels of physical 
activity.   
Following TKR, patients receive physical therapy either at home or at a skilled 
nursing rehabilitation facility and then transition to outpatient rehabilitation for 4-6 
weeks.20 The primary objective of therapy is to help the patient regain strength and 
mobility after surgery by [CONTACT_434426].21 
Improved function is reported by 70-80% of patients and decreased pain is reported by 85-90% of patients receiving physical therapy.
22 While physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_434403], encouraging patients to engage in the recommended 150 minutes/week of modera te-to-
vigorous intensity physical activity during and after therapy is outside of their focus and not typi[INVESTIGATOR_434404].
[ADDRESS_550422] focused on increasing overall physical activity levels 
in TKR patients; however, the increases in activity observed have been modest compared to changes observed in non-TKR populations and interventions were costly or resource intensive.
23-[ADDRESS_550423] 
with TKR patients (2 -3 times/week for 4 -6 weeks) and the sense of rapport that is 
established between the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57847],[ADDRESS_550424] to deliver a physical activity intervention. Given the success of physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_434405], mobility, and range of motion goals following TKR, it is likely that they could help patients increase their overall physical activity levels. TKR requires rehabilitation; thus, having physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_434406] a physical activity intervention during the required rehabilitation is a novel and efficient approach to reach patients and promote physical activity. This research is significant because it is the first step towards building a progressive line of research targeting the development of a low-additional cost and t ranslatable physical activity intervention that will have the ability to

outpatient, to TKR patients.  
Preliminary Studies:  
The PACE study (AHRQ K12HS023011) compared weight loss programs that started either before knee replacement (PACE) or started 12 weeks after surgery (Delayed PACE). Sixteen patients were randomized (63.3±7.5 years old, 69% female, 69% White, BMI of 36.5 ± 5.1 kg/m2) to PACE or Delayed PACE. Primary outcomes from 11 participants were objectively assessed at 26 weeks after surgery. Nine participants provided self-reported outcomes at approximately 12.78±1.[ADDRESS_550425] significantly more weight ( -7.6±5.9kg, -
7.9±5.9%) than PACE (-2.5±2.7kg, - 2.6± 2.6%) at 26 weeks (P=0.03). Delayed PACE 
maintained greater weight loss outcomes than participants in PACE at one year post-operatively. Pain intensity decreased (P<0.001) and function improved (P=0.001) significantly, but no significant changes were observed in physical activity (Table 1).

Secondary Outcomes :   
• Physical activity  will be measure d using Acti graph Link accelerometers owned b y 
the TecHealth  Center  at the Uni versity of South Carolina. During assessments, 
participants  will be asked to wear the Actigraph on their waist for 7 days. Non- wear 
time will be defined as ≥90 minutes with zero activity cou nts, allowing for up to 2 
minutes  of <100 counts/min.26 Physical activity will be categorized as light (100 -
2019 counts/min) and moderate- to-vigorous (MVPA) (≥2020 counts/min).27 Total 
MVPA over the week will be calculated. Steps/day will also be obtained. A valid day 
will be considered if participants wore the accelerometer for at least 10 hours/day. 
Participant s will also be asked to complete a log indicating times the accelerometer 
was worn and taken off over the 7- day assessment period.   
• Sedentary time  will be measured using ActivPALTM (PAL Technologies Ltd, 
Glasgow, [LOCATION_006]), a small lightweight (15 g)  uni-axial a ccelerometer. The time  spent 
sitting/lying, standing, and walking, transitions and step counts will be determined.  The ActivPAL  summarizes data in 15 second  intervals over 24 hours at a 
sampling frequency of 10 Hz.
28 During assessments, participants will be asked to 
wear the ActivPAL  on their thigh for 7 days. Par ticipants will also be asked to 
comp lete a log indicating times the  ActivPAL  was worn and taken off over the 7-day 
assessment period.     
• Physical function measures will include the chair stand, timed up and go, and 6-
minute walk test. All physical function  tests will be completed following 
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) recommendation 
procedures.[ADDRESS_550431] evaluates the maximal distance a patient can cover during a 6 -minute period.   
• Patient -Reported Outcomes will be assessed using two meth ods: 1) Patient-
Reported Outcomes Me asurement Information System (PROMIS)[ADDRESS_550432] via RedCap .31 We will assess  pain intensity , pain interference, 
and mobility ; 2) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index 
(WOMAC ) is a [ADDRESS_550433] 48-hourse on 
a 5-point Likert scale.32   
• Self-reported exercise identity  will be assessed at baseline and  12-week 
assessments using the Self-Reported Exercise Ide ntity Scale.33 Participants will rate 
on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) their feelings relating to exercise identity. Examples include, “I would feel a real loss if I were forced to give up exercising” and “I need exercise to feel good about myself.”

g. Proced ures Involved  
Design Overview:  We propose to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_329421]- arm cluster  randomized controlled 
trial with patients attending outpatient physical therapy fo llowing TKR. The proposed 
project was developed in collaboration with Debbie Brown, Senior Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_434417].  Over 9 months, TKR patients (n=50) attending 
outpatient physical therapy at Palmetto Health USC Orthopedic Center will be recruited and randomized to either 1) PATH-12 (control), or 2) PATH. Due to potential contamination of the intervention between patients in PATH-[ADDRESS_550434] been recruited.  During this time, those s ites randomized to Immediate will receive the PATH intervention and those sites 
randomized to Delayed will receive the PATH -12 intervention.  There will then be a 
“wash out period” to allow for all the participants to fi nish their current PT.  After this 
“wash out period”, the second phase of the study will begin and will end after [ADDRESS_550435] been recruited.  During this time, those sites randomized to Immediate will receive the PATH -12 intervention and those si tes randomized to Delayed will 
recei ve the PATH intervention.”   
Screening:  Participants will b e required to complete a brief screening after the first 
physical therapy appointment. Research staff will administer the screening in -person or 
over the telephone.  The screening will assess eligibility criteria and willingness to 
participate. Following th e completion of the screener, eligible and interested participants 
will be invited to complete the informed consent process.  
 
 Randomized Conditions:  
 
PATH-12 (control). Patients randomized to receive PATH -[ADDRESS_550436] physical therapy received and 
to enhance retentio n in the study, all participants who receive PATH -12 will be given a 
brief physical activity coaching session led by a trained USC research staff member at 12 weeks following the completion of the assessment. Participants will receive all materials

PRÉCIS  
Background:  
• Advanced mycosis fungoides, its leukemic form Sézary syndrome  (MF/SS) , and adult T -
cell leukemia /lymphoma  (ATLL) are all aggressive mature T -cell malignancies which are 
considered incurab le without an allogeneic stem cell transplant.  
• Mogamulizumab is a defucosylated monoclonal antibody directed towards CCR4, a 
chemokine receptor expressed by [CONTACT_138718]/SS and ATLL cells. It is approved 
by [CONTACT_138719]/SS, and 
is recommended by [CONTACT_138720].  
• Defucosylation of mogamulizumab is thought to enhance its capacity for antibody -
dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is mediate d by [CONTACT_113921] (NK) cells and 
macrophages.  
• The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin -15 (rhIL -15), a stimulatory 
cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and long -
term CD8+ memory T -cells, has bee n assessed in several phase I trials in cancer patients.  
• Concomitant administration of rhIL -15 with mogamulizumab may further enhance the 
ADCC capacity of the antibody and result in improved efficacy for patients with CCR4 -
expressing cancers.  
Objectives:  
• To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL -[ADDRESS_157601] 
intravenous (IV) mogamulizumab  treatment  
Eligibility:  
• Age ≥ 18 years of age  
• ECOG performance status of ≤ 1   
• Histologically or cytologically confirmed mycosis fungoides/S ézary syndrome or adult T -
cell leukemia/ lymphoma  relapsed after or refractory  to at least one line of systemic 
treatment.  
• Adequate organ and marrow functio n  
Design:  
• Open -label, single -center, non -randomized phase I study  
• Standard “3 + 3” design will be used to determine the MTD of dose -escalated rhIL -15 with 
fixed dose of mogamulizumab,  with a n expansion cohort at the MTD  
• Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycle s) of combination therapy  
• To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort,  and to 
account for unevaluable patients  the accrual ceiling will be set at 20 patients.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL E 
1.2.1 Adult T -cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)  
ATLL is an aggressive T -cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by [CONTACT_138724]4/CD25/CCR4 -expressing T cells in the peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues, and 
other organs. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_138692] T -cell lymphotrophic virus -1 (HTLV -1). ATLL cells exhibit 
immunophenotypic characteristics of mature T -regulatory cells, with surface expression of 
CD3dim, CD4, and CD25, and loss of CD7. There are four clinical subtypes of ATL ( Table 1), with 
median overall survival (OS) ranging from 72 months for chronic/smolderin g, 10.2 months for 
lymphomatous, and only 4.1 months for acute subtype in a cohort of 195 patients of predominantly 
Caribbean origin treated with modern therapi[INVESTIGATOR_138693] 2000 and 2016. (1)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment of ATLL  
There are no curative therapeutic options for patients with ATLL outside of early allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation, ideally immediately after achieving a  complete response to first -line 
chemotherapy. (3) Prognosis of ATLL relapsed or refractory to front -line therapy is dismal (4), and 
experience with the standard combination chemotherapeutic regimens known to be useful in the 
treatment of the more common aggressive B -cell non -Hodgkin lymphomas o r acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia has been disappointing. In North America, the majority of patients with the three more 
aggressive categories of ATLL (severe chronic, acute, and lymphoma subtype) are still treated 
with CHOP -based regimens (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone) with or 
without interferon and zidovudine. (5) In countries where ranimustine and vindesine are available, 
and which have the infrastructure for a more intensive chemotherapy regimen , the LSG15 protocol 
(VCAP -AMP -VECP)  is an option shown to be superior to biweekly CHOP in a phase III trial 
(complete response [CR] rate 40% v. 25%, 3 -year OS 24% v. 13%). (6) A meta -analysis showed 
that the addition of interferon and zidovudine to first -line therapy improved OS of patients with 
acute, chronic, and smoldering subtypes (7), but t here was a  lack of efficacy in patients with 
relapsed disease . 
There are no US FDA -approved drugs for relapsed/refractory ATLL, and no randomized phase III 
trials have been conducted in this patient population. Mogamulizumab  (KW -0761), a monoclonal 
antibody targetin g CCR4, is approved in Japan for treatment of CCR4 -positive ATLL. In a phase 
II trial of 27 Japanese patients with relapsed ATLL, overall response rate (ORR) was 50% (95% 
CI 30% to 70%), median progression -free survival (PFS) was 5.2 months, and median OS 13.7 
months. (8) An international randomized phase II stud y of mogamulizumab versus investigator -
choice chemotherapy in 71 patients from the US, Europe, and Latin America with aggressive 
relapsed/refractory ATLL showed confirmed ORR (response lasting ≥8 weeks) to be 11% versus 
0%, and best ORR 28% versus 8% ( in press). 
Lymphoid Malignancies Branch (LYMB) conducted a phase II trial of alemtuzumab (Campath) , 
an anti -CD52 monoclonal antibody, in 29 patients with relapsed chronic, acute, and lymphomatous 
4 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
subtypes of ATLL. ORR was 52% (95% CI 32% to 70%), but median du ration of response was 
only 1.4 months, with median PFS and OS of 2.0 and 5.9 months respectively. (9) 
Treatment with Lenalidomide , given to 26 patients in a multicenter phase II trial , resulted in an 
ORR  of 42% (95% CI 23% to 63%), including four CRs and one unconfirmed CR. (10) Median 
PFS and OS were 3.[ADDRESS_157606] results (ORR 4% to 
7%) with significant toxicity .(11-13) 
1.2.2 Mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (MF/SS)  
Cutaneous T -cell lymphomas are a diverse group of non -Hodgkin lymphomas characterized by 
[CONTACT_138725] T cells. Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common 
type of CTCL, arise s from accumulation of aberrant effector/resident memory CD4+ T-cells in 
skin lesions, while malignant clones in Sézary syndrome (SS), the erythrodermic and leukemic 
form of CTCL, are thought to arise de novo as an expansion of central memory T -cells. Alth ough 
very early stage MF patients have an indolent course with median OS  of 15-35 years, those with 
≥ stage IIB and SS patients have compromised survival (median OS  of 4.7 years for stage IIB -
IIIA, 2.1 -3.8 years for stage IIIB -IVA, and 1.4 years for stage IVB). (14)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment of MF/SS  
Other than allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (15), no treatment for MF/SS has 
been shown to be curative, and advanced disease can become refractory, leading to serious clinical 
compl ications. (14) Chemotherapy, includin g CHOP -based regimens, has high  response rates (50 -
88%), but duration of response  of <6 months and high toxicity .(14, 16, 17) There are five US FDA -
approved drugs for relapsed/refractory MF/SS  currently on th e market: bexaroten, romidepsin, 
vorinostat, brentuximab vedotin , and the recently approved mogamulizumab . The sixth , anti -CD25 
immunotoxin denile ukin dif titox, was withdrawn by [CONTACT_138726].  
The RXR -selective retinoid  bexaroten  was given at two different dose levels to 94 patients with 
stage ≥IIB CTCL, of whom 31% had erythroderma and 10% had visceral involvement .(18) Only 
16% of  patients had ≥15% circulating S ézary cells, though 27% had the cells detectable. ORR was 
45-55%, with 1 -5 CRs. One of five patients with circulating S ézary cells had a substantial decrease 
in counts. Six of 19 patients (32%) with generalized erythroderm a, and four of 17 (24%) with SS 
had a response. The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (34 - 45%) and pruritus 
(8-14%). One of 17 deaths was judged to be possibly drug related, that of a patient who developed 
liver failure with coagulopathy.  
The HDAC inhibitor  vorinostat  was investigated in a phase IIB multicenter trial of 74 patients, 61 
with advanced (stage ≥IIB) d isease, including 30 with SS . ORR was 29.7% (1 CR, 21 PRs), 
including 10/30 patients with SS. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were seen in 28% of  the patients, with the most 
common being fatigue (5%), pulmonary embolism (5%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and nausea 
(4%). (19) 
Another HDAC inhibitor,  romidepsin , was investigated in two concur rent phase II trials which 
included a total of 167 patients, 130 of whom had stage ≥IIB disease. (20, 21) ORR w as 34 -38%, 
and a total of 10 patients (6%) had CRs, three of whom had SS. Reports of grade 3 or 4 AEs varied 
between the studies, with lymphopenia ranging from 21% to <10%, neutropenia 14% to <10%, 
and thrombocytopenia 6% to none. There were [ADDRESS_157607] dose

Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_157608] from disease 
progression.  
Results of a phase III trial of brenutixmab vedotin  compared to methotrexate or bexaroten in 
CD30+ CTCL were r eported as positive for improvement in global overall response lasting at least 
4 months (ORR4), which was 56.3% v s. 12.5% after a medi an follow -up of 22.9 months. (22)  
Finally,  mogamulizumab  has shown efficacy in patients with cutaneous T -cell lymphoma. In the 
phase I/II study, among the 38 evaluable patients the ORR  was 36.8%; 47.1% in SS (n = 17) and 
28.6% in MF (n = 21). (23) Eighteen of 19 (94.7%) patients with blood involvement had a response 
in blood, including 11 CRs. Efficacy of mogamulizumab was confirmed in a phase III randomized 
controlled trial which demonstrated a  median 4.6 -month improvement in PFS as compared to 
vorinostat (7.7 vs. 3.1 months). (24) Importantly, CCR4 expression was not required for treatment, 
though an exploratory analysis showed 97% (280 of 290) patients to be CCR4  positive, defined as 
having at least 10% infiltrating CCR4 ᐩ lymphocytes on immunohistochemistry. No differences in 
response were seen in patients on the basis of skin CCR4 expression. Mo gamulizumab was well -
tolerated, with the majority of events Grade 1/2 that included nausea, chills, headache and infusion -
related reactions .  
1.2.3 Chemokine Receptor 4 (CCR4)  
CCR4 is a chemokine receptor that has a critical role in immune cell trafficking. Expression of 
CCR4 on normal lymphocytes is modest, as it is found predom inantly on T -regs and skin -homing 
memory T -cells that migrate toward the chemokines CCL17 and CCL22, which interact with the 
receptor CCR4. In contrast to the relative non -expression of CCR4 on normal lymphocytes, the 
leukemic cells in 90 percent of patien ts with ATLL cells express CCR4 on their surface. (25) 
Interestingly, the most frequent sites of ATLL involvement are lymph nodes and skin where 
dendritic cells, M2 -phenotype macrophages, Langerhans cells, and cutaneous ven ules can produce 
CCL17 and/or CCL22. A number of studies have provided insights concerning the mechanisms 
underlying the expression of CCR4 on ATLL cells. In our own studies we discovered recurrent 
somatic mutations in CCR4 in 14 of 53 ATLL cell samples (2 6 percent) that consisted exclusively 
of nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncated the coding region at C329, Q330, or Y331 in 
the carboxyl terminus. (26) Due to the deletion of the carboxyl terminus the CCR4 expression was 
maintained on the ATLL c ells rather than internalizing on the interaction with its cognate 
chemokine. Functionally, the CCR4 Q330 nonsense isoform was a gain -of-function because it 
increased cell migration towards CCR4 ligands CCL17 and CCL22. Furthermore, this mutant 
enhanced PI  (3) kinase/AKT activation after receptor engagement by [CONTACT_138727]22 and conferred a 
growth advantage in long -term in vivo  cultures. Even in the absence of the mutations it has been 
demonstrated that HBZ encoded by [CONTACT_138728] -1 in ATLL cells acts on the promoter of CCR 4 
augmenting expression of this receptor. In MF/SS, CCR4 was detected by [CONTACT_138729] 63% of patients (27), and by [CONTACT_138730] 97% (with positivity defined as 
≥10% of infiltrating lymphoid cells). (24) Similarly to ATLL, genomic studies of patients with SS 
have described gain -of-function nonsense mutations Q330 and Y331, as well as a new nonsense 
mutation Y347, and two new f rame shift mutations, C322fs and D341fs. (28) Taken together these 
findings implicate C CR4 expression in the pathogenesis of ATLL and MF/SS, and suggest that 
inhibition of CCR4 and its signaling may have therapeutic potential in these malignancies.

1.2.4 Mogamulizumab  
As noted above, the CC chemokine receptor 4 is expressed in the malignant cells of 90% of patients 
with ATLL and 97% of patients with MF/SS , however, with the exception of Tregs , is minimally 
expressed on normal lymphocytes. Mogamulizumab ( KW-0761 ) is a defucosylated humanized 
mAb with enhanced antibody cellular cytoto xicity (ADCC)  that binds to CCR4. (29)  
Mogamulizumab is devoid of complement dependent cytotoxicity. The antibody has shown potent 
antitumor activity mediated by [CONTACT_138731] .(30) The degree of mogamulizumab ADCC against primary ATLL cells in an 
autologous setting was mainly determined by [CONTACT_138732] (NK) cells 
present but not on the amount of targeted molecule CCR4 on the ATLL cell surface. (30) It is 
approved in Japan for treatment of CCR4 -positive relapsed/refractory ATLL and MF/SS, and in 
the US for the treatment of any MF/SS after at least one prior systemic therapy.  
In a post -marketing all -case survey conducted in Japan of patients with ATLL who received 
mogamulizumab, the overall response rate in the 308 patients treated with single -agent therapy 
was 57.7%. (31) Forty -two patients had received mogamulizumab after an allogeneic stem cell 
transplant. Grade [ADDRESS_157609] disea se (GVHD) occurred in 28.6% of these 
patients, all of whom received mogamulizumab within 90 days of transplant. Chronic GVHD 
occurred in 45% of patients who survived beyond 100 days after transplant. In a different analysis, 
patients with ATLL who carried any CCR4 gain -of-function mutation had superior response to 
mogamulizumab compared with wild -type CCR4 (5 -year OS 72.2% v s. 26.2%), despi[INVESTIGATOR_138694]4 doing worse compared to unmutated patients in historic controls. As 
hypothesized when CCR [ADDRESS_157610] described (26), this was likely the 
effect of impaired CCR4 internalization upon ligand binding, resulting in increased CCR4 
expression even in the presence of the ligand.  
1.2.5 Interleukin -15 
IL-15 is a 14 -15 kDa membe r of the 4 alpha -helix bundle family of cytokines that acts through a 
heterotrimeric receptor involving IL -2/IL-15R beta subunit shared with IL -2, the common gamma 
chain (γc) shared with IL -2, IL -4, IL -9, IL -21, and IL -15 specific receptor subunit IL -15R a lpha 
(CD215). (32-36)  IL-[ADDRESS_157611] been stim ulated with interferon (and/or) CD40 ligation. IL -[ADDRESS_157612] to IL -2 does 
not activate Tregs and participates less in the capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]. A number of  studies in 
murine models suggested that IL -15 may prove to be of value in the therapy of neoplasia.  The 
safety of IL -15 was evaluated in rhesus macaques. A 12 -day bolus intravenous administration of 
20 µg/kg/day of IL -15 to rhesus macaques was associated  with a 4 to 8 -fold increase in the number 
of circulating NK cells. (33)  When administered by [CONTACT_138733] 20 µg/day for 10 days it led to a 10 -

monocytes and a massive 80 to 100 -fold increase in the number of circulating effector memory

one by [CONTACT_138734] 30 minutes (37), one by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) administration (38), and the 
third by [CONTACT_138735]15 to patients with  metastatic malignancy. (39) The MTD by [CONTACT_138736] 0.3 mcg/kg/day, whereas  the MTD with SC  administration was 3 mcg/kg/day and by [CONTACT_138737] 
2 mcg/kg/day.  
In the phase I study of bolus infusions of recombinant Escherichia coli produced human IL -15, the 
MTD was determined to be 0.3 µg/kg/day for 12 days. At a dose of 3 µg/kg/day th e patients 
developed fever and rigors and a reduction in blood pressure that were concurrent with a maximum 
of 50 -fold elevations of circulating IL -6 and IFNγ concentrations.  The bolus infusion of IL -15 at 
3 µg/kg/day led to a 10 -fold expansion of NK cell s.  When IL -15 was administered subcutaneously 
5 days a week for 2 weeks at 3 mcg/kg/day there was a significant increase (mean 10.8 fold) in the 
number of circulating NK cells. Furthermore, when it was administered at 2 mcg/kg/day by 
[CONTACT_138738] s infusion there was an 8 -fold increase in this number during the infusion.  
Following termination of the infusion there was a 38 -fold increase in the number of NK cells and 
a 358 -fold increase in the number of CD56bright NK cells ( Figure 2A). A trial of IL -15 by [CONTACT_138739] 5 days has been initiated, and in the 1 1 patients studied following treatment there was a 21 to 
44-fold increase in the number of circ ulating NK cells, and up to an 8.9 -fold increase in the number 
of CD8+ T cells  (Figure 2B, Table 2 and Table 3).

rhIL-15 was administered at progressively increasing doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mcg/kg/day by 
10-day civ infusion (A) and 5 -day civ infusion (B) to patients with metastatic malignancy. Patients 2 -4 
received 0.125 mcg/kg, patients 5 -7 received 0.25 mcg/kg, patients 8 -10 received 0.5 mcg/kg, patients 11 -
16 received  1.0 mcg/kg and patients 17 -19 received 2.0 mcg/kg. Following termination of the treatment 
(red arrow) there was a dramatic 30 -fold increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes predominantly 
NK cell count and an over 350 -fold increase in the number of  circulating CD56bright NK cells in the 10 -
day cohort, and an up to 44 -fold increase (33 -fold mean increase) in the number of circulating NK cells in

[IP_ADDRESS]  Preclinical Trials of IL -[ADDRESS_157616] tumor cells. To further investigate this 
strategy, the Waldmann Laboratory used an immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model of B -cell 
lymphoma to investigate the combination of IL -15 with rituximab. (40) Wild -type CD56 and BL/6 
mice were inoculated intravenously with EL4 -CD20 cells, a mouse lymphoma line transfected 
with human CD20 and the mice were distributed into 4 treatment groups (control, IL -15 alone, 
rituximab alone and the combination) o f 10 mice each. IL -15 (5 µg/mouse) was administered 5 
times per week for 4 weeks beginning 3 days after EL4 -CD20 inoculation. In cohorts receiving 
rituximab , the monoclonal antibody was given once per week for 4 weeks starting 5 days after 
EL4-CD20 inocula tion. IL -15 or rituximab monotherapy prolonged survival of mice when

inoculation 90% of the combination treatment group were still alive in contrast to 30% survival 
from the monotherapy groups and no surviving mice in the control group ( Figure 3). In a parallel 
preclinical trial, the Waldmann Group administered a combination therapy of alemtuzumab with 
rhIL-15 in the MET -I bearing xenograft model in wild -type SCID/NOD mice ( Figure 4). Again, 
there was an augmentation of survival of the combination of IL -[ADDRESS_157618] been closed for patient accrual.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
In patients with relapsed/refractor y MF/SS or ATLL , IL-15 will be administered by [CONTACT_138746] a dose -escalation 3 + 3 system with a starting dose of 2 mcg/kg/day  and a  
second dose level of 4 mcg/kg/day on days 1 -5 of each of six cycles. Mogamulizumab  will be 
19 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_157631] 1 hour at a dose of 1 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle  1, and 
days 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle . Treatment will continue for a maximum of 6 cycles or 
until toxicity (i.e., dose limiting toxicity as found in Section 3.1.1  or toxicity requiring hold as 
defined in Section 3.3) or progressive disease.  
 
 
3.1.1 Dose  Limiting Toxicity  
A dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:  any grade 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_157632] 28 days of treatment, 
with the following exceptions:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematologic exceptions  
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia without clinical signs of infection grade 2 or above.  
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia without clinical signs of infection grade 2 or above.  
• Grad e 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia lasting fewer than 5 days and not associated with 
bleeding or purpura.  
• Grade 3 leukocytosis (WBC > 100,000/mm3) in the absence of signs of leukostasis or 
other toxicities possibly related to the expansion of activated cells.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-hematologic exceptions  
• Transient (< 24 hours) grade 3 hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, 
hyponatremia or hypophosphatemia which responds to medical intervention.  
• Non-sustained (< 7 days) grade [ADDRESS_157633] (ATL, AST, alkaline 
phosphatas e, total or direct bilirubin) abnormalities in the absence of clinical signs of 
hepatic dysfunction (lethargy, confusion, anorexia, pruritus, tremor); for patients with 
baseline grade 1 elevations, any increase ≥ 10 x baseline will be considered dose -
limit ing and these patients will be closely monitored for liver function abnormalities.  
• Grade 3 rash (maculo -papular, acneiform, or urticaria); if the rate of grade 3 rashes 
exceeds the expected rate (10% per mogamulizumab package insert) this will be 
reported as an unanticipated problem.  
• First grade 3 infusion reaction associated with mogamulizumab administration 
(occurring within 24 hours of the dose).  
Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in 
Section 3.3. If a DLT is possibly, probably, or definitely  related to IL -15 and unrelated or 

20 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
unlikely to be related to mogamulizumab, patient may continue treatment with mogamulizumab 
alone if PI [INVESTIGATOR_138696]’s best interest. Any DLT at least possibly 
related to mogamulizumab will le ad to permanent discontinuation of protocol therapy regardless 
of attribution to IL -15. The same management will apply to an o ccurrence  of any DLT -defining 
toxicity after the first 28 days of treatment; however, that toxicity will not be deemed a DLT for 
purposes of dose escalation.  
3.1.2 Dose Escalation  
Dose escalation will proceed according to the following schedule ( Table 6). Dose escalation will 
follow the following guidelines ( Table 7). DLT is defined above. Each patient will continue 
treatment at the dose level they were enrolled – there will b e no intra -patient dose escalation.  
The MTD is the dose level at which no more than 1 of up to 6 patients experience DLT during 
the DLT evaluation window(s), or the dose below that at which at least 2 (of ≤6) patients have 
DLT. The protocol will be amended  to note the MTD once determined.

3.2 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
Each cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). The minimum window between initiation of new cycles is 26 
days; a cycle delay due to scheduling or other ad ministrative reasons (i.e., reasons other than 
toxicity/dose management as defined below) is [ADDRESS_157636] cycle, and as 
outpatient during subsequent weeks and cycles unless decided  otherwise by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_138697]. Reported adverse events and potential risks are described 
in Section  14. Appropr iate dose modifications are described in Sectio n 3.3. No investigational or

3.5 ON STUDY EVALUATIONS  
Prior to mogamulizumab  administration (Day s 1, 8, 15 and 22  of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of 
cycles 2 -6), pre -dose assessments must be performed (up to 3 days prior). After Cycle 1, pre -dose 
assessments may be performed up to 3 days prior to a cycle except where otherwise noted. The 
results from all procedures/test s must be reviewed prior to initiation of each cycle of treatment for 
consideration of dose modifications and delay of therapy.  
Treatment with rhIL -15 and mogamulizumab  will continue for six cycles or until disease 
progression, unacceptable treatment -related toxicity or other reasons outlined in Section 3.9.1 . 
Refer to the Study Calendars (Section 3.7) for a complete list of procedures to be performed at 
each scheduled study visit. See also Section  5.1 for all samples to be collected for correlative 
research. During treatment, it is expected that all laboratory and clinical assessments be conducted 
at the NIH (including post -treatment imaging evaluations); results from outside NIH will only be 
accepted at the discretion of the investigator.  
3.[ADDRESS_157641] treatment evaluations (i.e., End of Treatment Visit) will be performed approximately [ADDRESS_157642] a CBC with differential and 
send the results. If this is not possible, patients may be assessed by [CONTACT_131805].  
Unless otherwise noted, follow -up will occur at the following time point: every 60 days (± 7 days) 
for 6 mo nths; then every 90 days (± 14 days) for 2 years; then every six months (± 28 days) for 2 
years, then annually (±6 weeks) at the discretion of the investigator. Any other evaluations and 
tests should be performed as clinically indicated.  
Upon disease prog ression or initiation of other anti -cancer therapy, contact [CONTACT_138747]  (i.e., every 3 months [ ±4 weeks]) ; unless otherwise clinically 
indicated . See Study Calendar ( Section 3.7) for additional information. Any adverse events which 
are present at the time of discontinuation should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements.   
Patients who stop treatment early will be followed until completion of the Safety Follow -up Visit 
or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study  treatment  for unacceptable 
adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.

Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
3.6.1 Safety Follow -Up Visit  
The safety follow -up visit should occur 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of trial treatment , or 
before the initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment, whichever comes first. Required testing is as 
noted in the Study Calendars ( Sectio n 3.7) All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit 
should be recorded.  Patients with an ongoing, treatment -related AE of Grade > [ADDRESS_157643].  SAEs that occur 
within 30 days of the end of treatment or before initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment should 
also be followed and recorded.  
3.6.2 Follow -Up Visits  — Prior to Disease Progression  
Patients who complete trial treatment without evidence of disease progression will move into the 
Follow -up Phase and may be assessed every 60 days (± 7 days) for 6 mont hs; then every 90 days 
(± 14 days) for 2 years; then every six months (± 28 days) for 2 years, then annually (±6 weeks) 
after finishing treatment  by [CONTACT_138748]. Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status until the start 
of new anti -neoplastic therapy, or disease progression . If the patient cannot return to the Clinical 
Center for any of these visits, a request will be made to have a local physician or laboratory  collect 
a CBC with differential and send the results. If this is not possible, patients may be assessed by 
[CONTACT_138749] .  
3.6.3 Follow -Up Visits — Survival/Post -Disease Progression  
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease pro gression or starts a new anti -cancer therapy, the 
subject moves into the survival follow -up phase and should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (e.g., phone, email, etc.; 
in-person visit not required) at least every 6 months (± 4 weeks)  to  collect information on new 
anti-cance r treatments received and to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of 
consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first (see Study Calendar)

5  CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
5.1 SUMMARY  
This stud y will attempt to use rhIL -15 to increase NK cell number and activity, thereby [CONTACT_138752]/SS and 
ATLL . ADCC capacity of ex vivo PBMCs will be tested on CCR4 -expressing cell l ines before, 
during , and after protocol treatment. CCR4 mutation status will be determined for each patient by 
[CONTACT_138753], and correlated with response and survival. Differences in circulating immune 
cell subsets associated with administration will b e followed throughout treatment to both study the 
effects of combined rhIL -15/mogamulizumab  therapy on the immune system, and to identify 
potential biomarkers that would be predictive of response.  With the same goal in mind, immune 
cell subsets in the tumo r microenvironment before and after treatment will be determined using 
single -cell RNA sequencing.

• Vial labels do not contain any personal identifier information.  
• Samples are stored inventoried in locked laboratory freezers and are routinely transfe rred 
to the NCI -Frederick repository facilities for long term storage.  
• Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Investigators establish sample collections 
under “Source Codes” and the Principal I nvestigator who is responsible for the collections 
specifies who has access to the collection.  
• Specific permissions will be required to view, input or withdraw samples from a collection. 
Sample withdrawal requests submitted to approved laboratory staff by [CONTACT_138765]. The 
repository facility will also notify the Source Code holder of any submitted requests for 
sample withdrawal.  
• It is the responsibility of the Source Code holder (the N CI Principal Investigator) to ensure 
that samples requested and approved for withdrawal are being used in a manner consistent 
with IRB approval.

_X_ Coded, linked  data in BTRIS (automatic for activities in the Clinical Center)  
_X_ Identified or coded, linked  data with approved outside collaborators under appropriate 
agreeme nts. 
How and where will the data be shared?  
Data will be shared through:  
_X_ An NIH -funded or approved public repository.  Insert name [CONTACT_138794]: ClinicalTrials.gov, 
dbGaP . 
_X_ BTRIS (automatic for activities in the Clinical Center)  
_X_ Approved outside collaborators under appropriate individual agreements.   
_X_ Publication and/or public presentations.  
When will the data be shared?  
_X_ Before publication.  
_X_ At the time of publication or shortly thereafter.  
6.2.2 Genomic Data Sharing Plan  
Unlinked genomic data will be deposited in public genomic databases such as dbGaP in 
compliance with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy.  
6.3 RESPONSE  CRITERIA  
6.3.1 Response Assessments  
Tumor response will be assessed by [CONTACT_138769] S core (41) and 
modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT)  (19) for patients with MF/SS, and the 
International Consensus Meeting guidelines (42, 43) for patients with ATLL.  Patient will be re -
evaluated for response as outlined in the Study Calendar, Section 3.7. 
6.3.2 Response Criteria for  MF/SS  
Global Response (GR) score (APPENDIX C) will be used for assessing response in patients 
with CTCL  (41). GR scor e incorporates separate responses in each component of the TNBM 
staging (i.e., skin, nodes, viscera and blood;  APPENDIX C). No patient with a global OR shou ld 
have less than a PR in the skin.  
41 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
The mSWAT  (19) is an instrument utilized to track the skin tumor burden in MF/SS. It measures 
the per centage total body -surface area (TBSA, %) involvement separately for patches, plaques, 
and tumors within 12 body regions using the patient's palm and fingers representing 1% of TBSA. 
Patients with erythroderma are assessed for percentage of TBSA involved w ith patches and/or 
plaques. The percentage of TBSA for each lesion type is multiplied by a number (patch = 1, plaque 
= 2; tumor = 4) and summed to derive the mSWAT score. The mSWAT for each patient will be 
determined by [CONTACT_138770]. 
A complete response (CR) requires 100% clearing of skin disease and a partial response (PR) 
requires ≥ 50% reduction in the mSWAT score compared with baseline. CR/PR requires 
confirmation by [CONTACT_138771] ≥ 4 weeks. Stable disease is defined  as less than 50% 
reduction to less than 25% increase in the mSWAT score compared with baseline. PD is defined 
as ≥ 25% increase in the mSWAT score from baseline or ≥ 50% increase in the sum of the products 
of the greatest diameters of pathologically posit ive lymph nodes compared with baseline.  
Time to response is the time from the first treatment dose until the patient first meets the criteria 
for a 50% decrease in the GR score. The duration of response (DOR) is the time from first CR/PR 
until the GR score  is increased from nadir to more than 50% of the difference between the baseline 
and nadir scores. Time to progression (TTP) is the time from start of treatment until PD. If patients 
goes off treatment for any purpose, this date is used for determination o f TTP and/or DOR.  
As “skin flares” have been described in patients with SS receiving the anti -PD-1 antibody 
Pembrolizumab  (44), patients with SS whose only sign of PD is an increase in mSWAT score (i.e., 
who have normal/decreasing number of circulating Sézary cells) will continue treatment and be 
re-evaluated in [ADDRESS_157663] had a skin flare

7.4 NIH  REQUIRED DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
7.4.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team  
The clinical research team will meet at least once weekly  when patients ar e being actively treated 
on the trial to discuss ea ch patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients.  
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Events meeting requirements for expedited reporting as described in 
Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_157668] a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2)  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investig ator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event (see  8.1.3 ) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_138773], without a serious deterioration 
in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is solely driven by [CONTACT_105] -medical reasons (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138707]) is not considered a serious adverse event . 
o Emergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in 
admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62489] a serious adverse event. The 
reason for seeking medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other 
serious criteria.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions

• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138708] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
8.1.3 Life-threatening   
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient  or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspec ted adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death (21CFR312.32)

8.6 REPORTING PREGNANCY  
8.6.1 Maternal  exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the study treatment should be 
discontinued immediately, and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor  no later than 24 hours of 
when the Investigator becomes aware of it . The Investigator should notify the Sponsor no later 
than 24 hours of when the outcome of the Pregnancy become s known,  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE. However, congenital  abno rmalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages that meet serious criteria section 8.1.2 ) should be reported as SAEs .  
The outcome of all pregna ncies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented.

Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_157673] and 
the adverse event.  CCR  will notify FDA and all participating inves tigators (i.e., all investigators 
to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND 
safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, 
in accordance to [ADDRESS_157674] annually in a summary format.  
9 CLINICAL  MONITORING  
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for conf irmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary  and secondary  study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, 
regulations, ICH E6, and SOPs; and human subjects protection. This is done through independent 
verification  of study data with source documentation focusing on:  
• Informed consent process  
• Eligibility confirmation  
• Drug administration and accountability  
• Adverse events monitoring  
• Response assessment.  
The monitoring program also extends to multi -site research when th e CCR is the coordinating 
center.  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_62561] a CCR  contractor. Monitors are qualified 
by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this 
study will not be affiliated i n any way with the trial conduct .   
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS  
• Primary Endpoint(s):  
o Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rhIL -15 administered intravenously for 5 days 
in combination with mogamulizumab for up to 6 cycles  
o Frequency (number and percentage) of treatment -emergent AEs  
• Secondary Endpoint(s):  
o Overall response rate (including CR and PR) 
49 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
o ORR, TTP, and PFS by [CONTACT_83541]4 mutation status (mutated versus wild type) and 
presenting diagnosis (MF/SS versus ATLL, MF versus SS, acute/chronic versus 
lymphoma subtype ATLL)  
o Duration of response  
o Progression -free, event -free, and overall survival  
o Changes in percentage and absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocyte 
subsets  
o Quantitation ADCC performed ex vivo on PBMCs obtained from the patients 
before and during treatment  
o Characterization of changes in immune cell infiltrates of tumor deposits by 
[CONTACT_138775]  
10.[ADDRESS_157675] of patients (0 of 3 or 0 -1/6 patients) treated 
experience a DLT, with the next higher dose level demonstrating one -third or a greater number of 
patients (≥ 2 -3 or ≥ 2 -6 patients) having a DLT.  If a subject did not experience a DLT and did not 
finish one cycle of treatment (28 days) he or she will not be evaluable for determination of the 
MTD and would be replaced in the dose level.  An additional 6 to 9 patients will be enrolled at the 
MTD, so that a total of 12 patients will be treated at this d ose.  
Using this dose -escalation scheme the probability of escalating to the next dose level will be based 
on the true rate of DLT at the current doses given by [CONTACT_138776] (each group will be 
considered independently of the other); Thus, if the tr ue underlying proportion of DLTs is 50% at 
the current dose there is a 17% probability of escalating to the next dose.  
 
True toxicity at a given dose  10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 
Probability of escalating  0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 
 
If both dose levels are evaluated with 6 patients per dose level and 12 total patients at the MTD, a 
maximum of 18 evaluable patients will be enrolled. Similarly, if all dose levels are evaluated with 
3 patients per dose level and 12 total patients at the MTD, th e minimum number of evaluable 
patients required will be 1 5. To account of unevaluable patients, accrual ceiling will be set at 20. 
It is expected that the accrual can be completed in 18 months.  
A maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled over 18 months, at a rate of 1  patient  per month.  
10.3 POPULATION FOR ANALYSIS  
10.3.1  Evaluable for toxicity:  
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with rhIL -15 and 
mogamulizumab . 
50 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
10.3.2  Evaluable for objective response:  
Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one 
cycle of t herapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. 
These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above, Section  
6.3. (NOTE:   Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of Cycle [ADDRESS_157676] 
one dose of stu dy drug are considered evaluable for toxicity and will not be replaced. ) 
10.3.3  Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response:   
Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of 
measurable disease, have received at least  one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -
evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target disease. The response assessment is based 
on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
10.4.1  General Approach  
The response rate will be determined and reported along with a 95%  Agresti -Coull  confidence 
interval  (45). Other time -to-event outcomes will be reported using Kaplan -Meier curves.  
10.4.2  Analysis of the Primary Endpoints  
Safety summaries will include summaries in the form of tables and listings. Reports will include 
the frequency (number and percentage) of treatment emergent AEs grouped by [CONTACT_138777] 
(per CTCAE, v5 .0) and by [CONTACT_8792] (e.g., either rhIL -15, mogamulizumab , or 
both).  
Laboratory shift tables containing counts and percentages will be prepared by [CONTACT_11512], laboratory parameter, and time. Summary tables will be prepared for each laboratory 
parameter. Figures of changes in laboratory parameters over time will be generated.  
Results of vital sign assessments, ECGs, and physic al exams will be tabulated and summarized.  
10.4.3  Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints  
The duration of response (DOR; beginning at the date clinical response is first identified), overall 
survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and progression free survival (PFS ) will be estimated 
using Kaplan -Meier curves with appropriate confidence intervals reported.  
Every report of response rates and time to progression should contain all patients included in the 
study. For the response calculation, the report should contain at least a section with all eligible 
patients. Another section of the report may detail the response rate for evaluable patients only.  
However, a response rate analysis based on a subset of patients must explain which patients were 
excluded and for which reasons.  95% confidence limits will be given.  
10.4.4  Safety Analyses  
The type, grade and frequency of toxicities will be reported.  
10.4.5  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics (including means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables 
and proportions and CIs for discrete variables) will be used to summarize data as appropriate.  
51 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
10.4.6  Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned because of the single stage design of the trial.  
10.4.7  Sub-Group Analyses  
All secondary endpoints will be analyzed and reported separately according to the presenting 
diagnosis ( MF/SS or ATLL, and MF, SS, acute, chronic, or lymphoma subtype ATLL ) and CCR4 
mutation status (mutated versus wild -type).   
10.4.[ADDRESS_157677] Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The analyses will be

11 COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS   
11.1 MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT (MTA) - CTEP  
An MTA with Division of Ca ncer Treatment and Diagnosis  (DCTD ) for the IL -[ADDRESS_157678] SELECTION  
All subjects from both sexes  and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibi lity criteria outlined in the protocol and provide informed consent to protocol participation. 
Subjects with HIV infection will be excluded due to potential toxicity and unknown effects of 
rhIL-[ADDRESS_157679] men and women to be equally represented among the enrolled patients.  
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Subjects under the age of 18 are excluded because recurrent T -cell lymphomas are rare in young 
patients, and the inclusion of an occasional younger patient will not provide generalizable 
information that would justify their inclusion on this study. Additionally, because no dosing or 
adver se event data are currently available on the use of rhIL -15 in combination with 
mogamulizumab  in patients <[ADDRESS_157680] benefit from 
52 
Abbreviated Title:  IL-15+Mogamulizumab  
Version Date:  11/16/2020  
research participation (Sectio n 12.4), all subjects ≥ age 18 will be offered the opportunity to fill in 
their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance 
Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can 
make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively 
impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138710] C onsent 
Assessment Team  (ACAT)  for evaluation  as needed for the following:  an independent assessment 
of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and 
assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an ass essment of the capacity to appoint 
a surrogate .  For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have pre -determined 
substitute decision maker, the procedures described in NIH HRPP SOP 14E  for appointing a 
surrogate decision maker for adult subject s who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not 
have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  
12.4 RISK/ BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
12.4.1  Known Potential Risks  
The potential  risks of adding rhIL -15 to moga mulizumab include, in particular , infusion reactions 
(including chills, fever, hypotension, headache, flushing, dizziness) , liver enzyme elevations, 
thrombocytopenia, and rash, particularly since the drugs are given concomitantly. As noted in 
Section 3.2, premedication will be given during IL -15 infusions and before each mogamulizumab 
dose to reduce the risk of these AEs occurring. Patients  will be monitored closely, and 
manufacturer recommendations for delaying and discontinuing mogamulizumab and initiating 
supportive therapy will be followed.  
In addition to the tumor cells, CCR4 is also expressed on normal immune cells , 
immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs) in particular . While Treg depletion may have an 
anti-tumor effect, it also increases the risk of GVHD. In a post -marketing study conducted in Japan, 
among [ADDRESS_157681] GVHD developed it after mogamulizumab. (46). 
International Consensus Group therefore recommends avoiding mogamulizumab within [ADDRESS_157682], but deemed it acceptable to use for patients with a more remote tr ansplant history. 
(42). 
12.4.[ADDRESS_157683] is given, headache, 
metallic and/ or bitter taste in the mouth and a warm, flushing feeling.  R arely, some people have 
more severe allergic reactions to the contrast which may include skins rashes, shortness of breath, 
wheezing or low blood pressure.  
12.4.[ADDRESS_157684] and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans wi ll follow clinical 
policies, no special procedures apply to these assessments for research purposes.  In summary, 
subjects may receive radiation exposure from up to s even  (7) CT scans of the neck, chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis, and three (3) 18F-FDG PET/CT  scans.  
The total radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 1 2.7 rem.

12.4.4  Known Potential Benefits  
The benefit of adding rhIL -15 to mogamulizumab  in treatment of MF/SS and ATLL is unknown, 
but single -agent mogamulizumab has  shown activity as outlined in Sectio n 1.2.4 , is US FDA -
approved for treatment of advanced MF/SS, and is recommended by [CONTACT_138778]/refractory ATLL.  
12.4.5  Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
Mogamulizumab is FDA -approved for treatment of MF/SS and NCCN -recommended for 
treatment of ATLL. Since its primary mode of action is mediated by [CONTACT_138779] , agents that may 
enhance ADCC by [CONTACT_138780] -binding effector cells — such as rhIL15 
— could improve efficacy of mogamulizumab  in these diseases. Although the clinical benefit of 
IL-[ADDRESS_157685] been no studies of IL -15 in patients with HIV on or off ART. Two non -human primates 
with SIV who were not on ART and received rhIL -15 on Study 2078 -[ZIP_CODE] both died, while 
subsequent animals who received viral suppression were seemingly unaffected. rhIL -15 may 
therefore contribute to morbidity/mortality in patients with a detectable viral load.  Since potential

[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Names  
Recombinant Human Interleukin -15; Recombinant Human IL -15; rhIL -15 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classification  
Recombinant human interleukin -15 (rhIL -15) is a cytokine of the 4 -alpha helix bundle family 
of cytokines whose mature form consists of 115 amino acids.  It has two cystine disulfide cross 
linkages at pos itions Cys 42 -Cys 88 and Cys 35 -Cys 85 .

12,898.8 Daltons  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mode of Action  
IL-15 interacts with a private receptor subunit IL - 15R alpha as well as the IL -2/IL-15R beta 
chain shared with IL -2 and the common gamma chain shared with IL -2, IL-4, IL -7, IL -9 and 
IL-21.  IL -15 shares a number of biological activities with IL -2, including stimulation of the 
proliferation of activated CD4+, CD8+ as well as gamma -delta subsets of T cells.  IL -15 also 
stimulates the proliferation of NK cells and acts as a co -stimulator with IL -12 to facilitate the 
production of Interferon -gamma and TNF -alpha .

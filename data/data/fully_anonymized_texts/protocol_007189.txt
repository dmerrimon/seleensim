Rationale and background  
 
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a condition in which a spectrum of abnormal cells accumulates within the lumen of mammary duct but has not invaded the surrounding breast tissue.
1 Because of the increased use of screening mammography, the incidence of DCIS has 
increased dramatically, accounting for approximately 25% of all new breast cancer diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002].
2,[ADDRESS_336639] conserving surgery (BCS) alone, even among patients with favorable pathologic characteristics. Such findings argue against active surveillance for DCIS treatment. However, evidence exists that older DCIS patients have a lower 
rate of ipsilateral recurrence because DCIS among older patients tends to be indolent. Identifying suitable subgroups among this lower risk group who may be safe t o receive a less aggressive 
treatment could change the current practice pattern of aggressive treatment.  
Even when DCIS patients opt to receive a less intensive treatment such as BCS without radiation therapy, they and their providers need to decide whether to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The role of SLNB for DCIS management is controversial in general and needs further scrutiny in particular if patients received BCS without radiation therapy. Significant debates continue about whether SLNB should be performed,
6-8 with some experts advocating for its 
use.9,10 Proponents of SLNB cite concerns that occult microinvasive disease within the DCIS 
may not be detected histologically, with an estimated prevalence of 1.4% to 12%.[ADDRESS_336640] will use existing data to swiftly provide comprehensive information about comparative effectiveness across the DCIS care continuum in an observational study setting.   
Study objectives  
 Using the Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data, our project’s overarching aims are:  
Among older women with DCIS who have received BCS as their first surgery, to compare the outcomes of receiving SLNB vs. not receiving SLNB within 6 months of DCIS diagnosis: 
Aim 1: We will determine associations between SLNB and acute/subacute side effects, including 
lymphedema,  pain, and limitation of movement of upper extremity from the first BCS to [ADDRESS_336641]-diagnosis.  Aim 2: We will determine associations between SLNB and long -term outcomes, including breast 
cancer specific mortality, ipsilateral invasive breast cancer d iagnosis, subsequent mastectomy as 
treated recurrence, and lasting side effects, from >[ADDRESS_336642] of SLNB on clinical outcomes of women with newly diagnosed DCIS among the Medicare population. The nature of SEER- Medicare linking 
Medicare claims records to tumor registries part icipating in the NCI’s SEER program allows us 
to select study population based on precise demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients. In our study, the population is DCIS patients older than 67 years (hereafter referred to as older women) who were enrolled in a fee- for-service Medicare program and resided in the 
SEER areas from 1998 to 2011 (1998-2013 for Aim 2) and who were followed up to 2012 (2015 for Aim 2).  
 
Methodology 
 Our study population are generated within the SEER- Medicare linked database. To identify 
patients with DCIS, we will use histology and behavior codes, which are converted from the ICD-O-[ADDRESS_336643] “cancer” patients with in situ tumor behavior (behavior code = 2). DCIS patients will be further limited to those with ICD -O-[ADDRESS_336644] surgery (i.e. excluding patients who received mastectomy first). We expect that patients who received BCS 
with SLNB (compared with those who received BCS without SLNB) would be more likely to end up with mastectomy, and thus would be more likely to have side effects. Findings of the associations between SLNB and mastectomy as the final treatment for DCIS would be informative. We intend to include these patients in Aim [ADDRESS_336645] important clinical implications.  
The time period for defining the cohort for the Aim 1 will be between January 1998 and December 2011. Using medical claims for this cohort, we will identify any side effects within a 
9-month window (from DCIS diagnosis to [ADDRESS_336646]-diagnosis). The time period for 
defining the cohort for the Aim [ADDRESS_336647] cancer specific mortality through December 
2013, and claims data (to identify treated recurrence) through December 2014. We identify interventions and comparators in our study using specific international classification  
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, (ICD-9) codes, CPT codes and HCPCS codes.  We will limit our sample to DCIS patients who received BCS as their first surgery; that is, we exclude patients whose first surgery is mastectomy, because we are only interested in pa tients who receive less 
intensive treatment and their outcomes. Because SLNB is performed by a surgeon, we identify it within a window consistent with those used in prior literature to identify breast cancer surgery, that is, between the date of the first BCS and [ADDRESS_336648]. In Aim 1 we focus on acute/sub- acute side effects. 
Secondary outcomes include treatment received. In Aim 2, our primary outcomes include breast cancer specific mortality, incident ipsilateral invasive breast cancer occurrence (based on ipsilateral invasive breast cancer from SEER) and treated recurrence (based on follow -up 
mastectomy). Secondary outcomes include overall survival and lasting side effe cts. Overall 
survival, expected to be similar, would be used as a benchmark outcome to check performance of our model.  In addition to the key exposures (interventions and comparators) and endpoints (outcomes of interest), we will further select covariates , including patient demographics, comorbidities, tumor 
characteristics and prior healthcare utilization, based on prior literature and our experience. We plan to include the following covariates to control for confounding. For patient demographics, we will include patient’s age, sex, ethnicity, marital status and years of diagnosis. For 
geographical and social -economical characteristics, we will include income, education and 
metropolitan residence. For patient’s comorbidities, we plan to include Elixhauser comorbidity index, disability index and prior hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For DCIS characters, we will include grade, size, comedonecrosis and hormone receptor status. For health care system utilization, we will consider prior influenza vaccination, physician visit, MRI use and surgeon’s volume. Last, to control for other treatment patients have received, we will adjust for mastectomy and radiation therapy.  
 
Data management and statistical analysis 
 We plan to create a dataset for this project. Each patient in the SEER -Medicare dataset has a 
unique patient identification number. Using this information, we will be able to collect patient demographics and DCIS characteristics from the SEER registry as w ell as claims data from 
Medicare on what treatment patients have received or what side effects they have experienced. We will manage the dataset in a suitable manner that fully complies with the SEER -Medicare 
data use rules and confidentiality.  As a secondary data analysis, we will be unable to prevent missing data from the original dataset. We do, however, set a priori exclusion and inclusion criteria for the creation of our cohort. We 
will include only DCIS patients who have available claims data (i.e. are enrolled in fee- for-
service coverage) during the period between cancer diagnosis and the end of the follow-up (Aim 
1: 9 months after DCIS diagnosis; Aim 2: either death or the last date of claims released by [CONTACT_275642]-Medicare). Statistically, we plan to cre ate an “unknown” category to capture those 
patients who had a missing value. Additionally, we will conduct sensitivity analyses regarding whether or not excluding these patients would change our findings. To compare baseline characteristics between intervention and control groups, we will conduct standard descriptive statistics using χ
[ADDRESS_336649] our hypotheses while controlling for unbalanced covariates, as described below.   
We plan to control for selection bias using propensity score matching methodology.
17 
Specifically, the propensity score matching will be based on the Mahalanobis distance18 
calculated using age, race, residence in a metropolitan county, comorbidity, prior influenza vaccination or prior visit to a primary care physician (both as proxies for access to care), income, preoperative MRI use, and tumor characteristics. Tumor characteristics include size, grade, comedonecrosis, and estrogen receptor status. By [CONTACT_275643], we expect to substantially decrease bias and balance the risk for outcomes of interest between the SLNB and non-SLNB groups. We will use 2: [ADDRESS_336650] non-SLNB patient matches for each SLNB patient; when two or more SLNB patients match the same control (that is, have Mahalanobis distances minimized by [CONTACT_275644]), one will be randomly selected as a match, and this process reiterates un til all SLNB patients have two 
matched controls. We will assess the validity of the matching by [CONTACT_275645]-SLNB groups using χ2 tests. The difference in outcomes between the control and intervention groups will be estim ated in a Kaplan -Meier curve. We will estimate the relative 
risk in the propensity score matched sample using the standard method for matched- pair data.
20 
We will use the Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the association between various factors (grade, tumor size, and estrogen receptor status) and outcomes.
21  
For multivariable analyses, we will use conditional logistic regression models for acute/subacute side effects (primary outcomes) and treatment received (mastectomy or radiation therapy; secondary outcomes) in Aim 1, with conditioning on the matched variable. For primary outcomes, we will run [ADDRESS_336651] ratios of SLNB on these outcomes. The proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated for each model using a variety of methods (evaluation of Kaplan- Meier and log( -log) survival plots, Shoenfield residuals, and covariate x 
time interactions). If the proportional hazards assumption is violated, we will instead use parametric survival models, usi ng AIC and BIC to determine the best parameterization 
(exponential, Weibull, generalized gamma, Gompertz, lognormal, or loglog). All time -to-event 
models will incorporate a shared frailty term for the matching group, and will include covariates that are no t balanced by [CONTACT_275646]. These models will allows us to test for association between 
various factors (grade, tumor size, and estrogen receptor status) and outcomes. 
In order to identify suitable patient subgroups that may be able to forego SLNB, we plan to 
explore the following stratification schemes in Aim 2 analysis: 1. Stratify patients by [CONTACT_275647]; 2. Stratify patients by [CONTACT_275648], including grade, comedonecrosis and tumor size; 3. Stratify patients by [CONTACT_275649], given their age, sex and comorbidities.   
Expected outcomes of the study  
 According to our specific aims, we propose different outcomes of interest. For Aim 1, our primary outcome is the side effect occurrence within [ADDRESS_336652] cancer occurrence and treated recurrence, including mastectomy, within the same timeframe. For Aim 2, our secondary outcomes include overall survival (a benchmark outcome to check the performance of analytic models) and lasting side effects.  
As for detailed outcome measurements, we expect to have these estimates by [CONTACT_259452]: 1. the difference in baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups and χ2 statistics that suggests difference significance; 2. the propensity score matching results, including matched cohort and the standardized difference that indicates the balance of matching; 3. the estimate in the main analysis, for example odds ratio, rate ratio or hazard ratio, that could represent the association of intervention and outcome; 4. the estimate in the stratified analysis that could describe the association of intervention and outcome in each clinical subgroup.

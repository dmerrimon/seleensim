SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title  
 
An Open -label, Nonrandomized, Single -dose, Parallel -group, Safety, Tolerance, and 
Pharmacokinetic Study of LOXO -305 Administered to Fasted Renally Impaired Male and 
Female Subjects and Fasted Matched -control Healthy Subjects  
 
Objectives  
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 
LOXO -305 in subjects with impaired renal function compared to matched -control healthy 
subjects.  
 
The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO -305 in 
subjects with impaired renal function and matched -control healthy subjects.  
 
Study Design  
 
This study is an open -label, nonrandomized, multi -center, single -dose, parallel -group study to 
determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of LOXO -305 administered orally at a dose of  
200 mg to fasted adult males and females with impaired renal function and healthy subjects 
with normal renal function. Renal function will be classified based on the baseline estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10427] (CKD -EPI) study equation. Baseline eGFR will be obtained for all subjects 
(ie, subjects with renal impairment and matched -control healthy subjects) by [CONTACT_132187] 
a 3-month period from Screening. If no historical eGFR value is available, a second 
Screening eGFR sample will be taken during the Screening period (  14 days apart) and 
the mean of the [ADDRESS_149254] fall within the specified eGFR ranges for each group (ie, matched -control 
healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment [and subjects with mild and/or 
moderate renal impairment, if they are enrolled]) to categorize subjects’ renal impairment 
status. The eGFR based on CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_132169] -in (Day -1) to 
confirm renal impairment status. For matched -control healthy subjects, a single assessment of 
actual creatinine clearance computed over a [ADDRESS_149255] of 
the eGFR (based on the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]), at the Investigator’s (or designee’s) discretion.  
 
Subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 4), and matched -control healthy subjects with 
normal renal function (Group 1) will begin enrolling in the study first. Subjects will be 
recruited so that up to [ADDRESS_149256] 6 matched -control healthy subjects complete the study.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their eGFR values calculated 
using the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_132170] -in (Day -1) as judged by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee), Covance Medical Monitor, and Sponsor:

• Group 1: Matched -control healthy subjects with normal renal function  (eGFR:  
≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
• Group 4: Subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR: < 30 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
Continuous review of the safety data and PK data (if available) from up to [ADDRESS_149257] completed all study -related assessments 
through 72 hours (approximately 3 half -lives) postdose, at a minimum. The safety data will 
include adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory evaluations.  
 
Following continuous review of the safety data and PK data from up to 8 subjects with severe 
renal impairment (Group 4) and up to 8 matched -control healthy subjects with normal renal 
function (Group 1), subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 2) and/or moderate renal 
impairment in (Group 3) may be enrolled if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034]. If no clinically 
relevant effect on PK is observed in subjects in Group 1 and Group 4, enrollment of subjects 
in Group 2 and/or Group 3 will not occur.  
 
If the Sponsor deems it necessary to enroll subjects with mild and/or moderate renal 
impairment, subjects will be recruited so that up to [ADDRESS_149258] 6 subjects with moderate renal impairment 
and their matched -control healthy subjects complete the study. Enrollment and dosing for 
subjects in Group 2 and/or Group [ADDRESS_149259](s) 
in Group 1 and Group 4 through a minimum of 72 hours postdose are reviewed and the 
Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed 
with dosing.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their eGFR values calculated 
using the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_132170] -in (Day -1) as judged by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee), Covance Medical Monitor, and Sponsor:  
 
• Group 2: Subjects with mild renal impairment (60 ≤ eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate renal impairment (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
Baseline eGFR will be obtained for all subjects (ie, subjects with renal impairment and 
matched -control healthy subjects) by [CONTACT_132188] a 3 -month period from Screening. 
If no historical eGFR value is available, a second Screening eGFR sample will be taken 
during the Screening period (  14 days apart) and the mean of the [ADDRESS_149260] fall within the specified 
eGFR ranges for each group (ie, matched -control healthy subjects and subjects with severe 
renal impairment [and subjects with mild and/or moderate renal impairment, if they are 
enrolled]) to categorize subjects’ renal impairment status. The eGFR based on CKD -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_132169] -in (Day -1) to confirm renal impairment status. For 
matched -control healthy subjects, a single assessment of actual creatinine clearance  
Protocol  
Covance Study: 8419692  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ADDRESS_149261] of the eGFR (based on the 
CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]), at the Investigator’s (or designee’s) discretion.  
 
Each matched -control healthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by 
[CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), body mass index (BMI; ± 20%), and sex to the completed renal impairment 
subject(s). Should another renal impairment subject be identified with whom an already 
enrolled healthy subject is demographically matched, the healthy subject may also be 
matched with that impaired subject as long as the impaired subject is in a different renal 
impairment group. Each subject with normal renal function may be matched with up to [ADDRESS_149262] who is enrolled in the study signs 
an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects 
who are assigned a dose of study drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects.  
Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check -in). 
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the 
Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor and the 
Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened 
subjects will be provided a new subject number.  
 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day -1) until End of 
Treatment (EOT) on Day 8 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early 
Termination (ET) if the subject discontinues. Subjects will be dosed on Day 1. A follow -up 
phone call will occur for all subjects who received a dose of study drug (including subjects 
who are terminated early) 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET.  
 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained through 168 hours postdose.  
 
In this study, physical examinations, 12 -lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, How Do You 
Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology 
panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2 ), and recording of concomitant medications will be 
performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and details on each 
study variable, refer to Appendix 4 ). 
 
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events 
will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], 
or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up 
phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to 
signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is 
assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) or as AEs (if the 
event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is 
assessed as related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if the event 
occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship 
to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF 
signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a 
follow -up phone call) are to be  reported.

age, inclusive, at Screening, and within BMI range 18.5 to 40.0 kg/m2, inclusive. Subjects 
will be in good general health, except for additional specific inclusion criteria related to 
subjects with renal impairment, based on medical history, physical examination findings, 
vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations at Screening 
and/or Check -in (Day -1), as determined by [CONTACT_737] (or designee).  
 
Investigational Medicinal Products, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
 
LOXO -305 will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee) as [ADDRESS_149264] Participation in the Study:  
 
Planned Enrollment/Screening Duration: Approximately 28 days (Days -29 to -2). 
Length of CRU Confinement: Up to 9 days (Days -1 to 8).

maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), time to maximum observed plasma 
concentration (t max), apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z), apparent systemic 
clearance (CL/F), apparent plasma terminal elimination half -life (t ½), mean residence time 
(MRT), unbound fraction (f u), and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase 
(Vz/F). 
 
The f u value determined for each subject will be used to calculate the following unbound 
LOXO -[ADDRESS_149266]: Unbound C max (Cmax,u), unbound 
AUC 0-t (AUC 0-t,u), unbound AUC 0-inf (AUC 0-inf,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V z/F 
(Vz/F,u). 
 
Safety:  
 
Safety will be monitored with How Do You Feel? inquiries, clinical laboratory evaluations, 
vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examinations.  
 
Statistical Methods  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO -305 after a single 
dose in subjects with renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.  
 
Paired t -tests will be performed to assess the differences in PK parameters (AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, 
and C max) between each renal impairment group versus the corresponding matched -control 
healthy group with respect to 1 to 1 matching. The analysis will be based on the natural log 
(ln)-transformed PK parameters. Geometric mean ratios and their corresponding 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated using the exponentiation of the mean difference 
and the CIs obtained for the difference in mean between each renal impairment group and the 
matched -control healthy group.  
 
In addition, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the ln -transformed 
AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. The ANCOVA model will contain a categorical factor of 
population for subjects with varied -degree renal impairment (severe, moderate, and mild) and 
matched -control healthy subjects, a categorical covariate (sex), and continuous covariates 
(age and BMI). Ratios of least squares means and 90% CIs will be calculated using the 
exponentiation of the difference between renal function cohort least squares means from the 
ANCOVA analyses on the ln -transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. In addition, an 
ANCOVA will be performed on the ln -transformed AUC 0-t,u, AUC 0-inf,u, and  Cmax,u. 
 
The specific procedures will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP).  
 
The relationship between LOXO -305 PK parameters (ie, C max and AUC) and measures of 
renal function (such as eGFR and creatinine clearance) may be explored using a linear 
regression approach or other methods, as indicated in the SAP. The effect of covariates such 
as age, BMI, and sex may be investigated.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational medicinal product , LOXO -305.1 
1.1. Background  
 
LOXO -305 (also known as LY3527727) is a selective inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) being developed by [CONTACT_132189]. LOXO -[ADDRESS_149275] from the approved 
BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib) in several important ways 
including on the basis of its selectivity, favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion properties, and non -covalent binding mode.2 These features enable LOXO -305 to 
achieve pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures that exceed the BTK concentration resulting in 90% 
inhibition (IC 90) at trough, and thus deliver tonic BTK target inhibition throughout the dosing 
period, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover. Moreover, the non -covalent binding 
mode of LOXO -305 is unaffected by [CONTACT_132190] C481 substitutions, a common mechanism of drug 
resistance described for all available covalent inhibitors.3,4,5,6,7 Finally, LOXO -305 is also a 
highly selective molecule that is more than 300 -fold more selective for BTK versus 370 other 
kinases tested with no significant inhibition of non -kinase off -targets at 1 μM, thus limiting 
the potential for off -target mediated toxicities. Collectively, these unique properties of 
LOXO -305 are expected to deliver more potent, continuous, and selective inhibition of BTK 
in a variety of settings, potentially resulting in increased efficacy. Of note, the activity of 
LOXO -305 in diverse preclinical model systems supports this underlying hypothesis.2 
LOXO -305 is a small molecule that was designed to block the adenosine triphosphate 
binding site of the BTK competitively. There is no evidence of irreversible binding.  
LOXO -305 has a molecular weight of approximately 500 g/mol. LOXO -305 will be supplied 
as an immediate -release tablet containing 100 mg of drug substance.  
 
1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology  Summary  
 
LOXO -305 had high permeability in vitro, but low aqueous solubility. To reduce the 
variability in oral absorption, a spray -dried dispersion (SDD) tablet formulation was 
developed that showed consistent oral bioavailability of approximately 50% in rats and 80% 
in dogs. The bioavailability of the SDD formulation was also not dependent on feeding state 
in dogs.  
 
As is common in rodents, oral exposure of LOXO -305 was consistently much higher in 
female rats than in males given the same dose of LOXO -305. The sex difference was also 
apparent after intravenous administration of LOXO -305. There was no difference in the PK 
of LOXO -305 between sexes of dog, and none is expected in other non -rodent species, 
including humans.  
The volume of distribution (V z) of LOXO -305 ranged from approximately 2 L/kg in the dog 
to 5 L/kg in the male rat, which indicates that LOXO -305 distributes into tissues. LOXO -305 
had protein binding of approximately 95% in human plasma. A somewhat lower extent of 
binding (approximately 82% to 92%) was observed across mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog.

OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP.  
 
1.4. Summary of Clinical  Experience  
 
LOXO -305 is currently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/[ADDRESS_149285] -in-human study, 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] (the BRUIN Study), in patients with previously treated chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL). The starting dose of LOXO -305 was 25 mg QD.  
 
As of September 27, 2020, safety data were available from a total of 330 patients treated in 
the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study. This includes 324 patients treated at doses ranging from 25 mg 
QD to 300 mg QD in Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, and 6 patients treated in Phase 1b 
Combination Arm A (LOXO -305 200 mg QD plus venetoclax 400 mg QD [after ramp -up] 
Section 1.4.1 ). 
 
As of September 30, 2020, PK data were available from 181 patients enrolled in the 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study ( Section 1.4.2 ).

• In the 324 patients in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, TEAEs reported in ≥ 10% 
of patients (n = 33 or more) were fatigue (20.1% total, 8.3% related), diarrhea (17.0% 
total, 8.6% related), and contusion (13.0% total, 9.0% related). Drug related TEAEs 
were reported in 156 of 324 patients (48.1%) in the Phase 1/[ADDRESS_149290] frequently reported drug -related TEAEs for LOXO -305 (those in > 5% of 
patients overall) were contusion (9.0%), diarrhea (8.6%), and fatigue (8.3%). All 
other drug -related TEAEs were reported in < 5% of patients (ie, <17 patients each). 
Treatment -emergent AEs of severity Grade 3 or 4 were reported in 87 of 324 patients 
(26.9%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, with 41 (12.7%) of these Grade 3 or 4 
AEs reported as related to study  drug.  
 
On-study death (death within [ADDRESS_149291] dose of study drug) due to a Grade 5 (fatal) 
AE was reported in 4 of 324 patients (1.2%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts . One 
Grade 5 AE, Enterococcus faecium -related septic shock, was considered to be related to 
study drug (further details are provided in the LOXO -305 IB1). All other Grade 5 AEs were 
considered to be not related to study drug; these included pneumonia fungal, shock, and 
pleural effusion.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study (headache, nausea, and vomiting), were all Grade [ADDRESS_149292] 
and resolved within 1 to 1.5 days.  
 
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study (intermittent belching, bloating, insect bite, aphthous ulcer, 
nausea, intermittent diarrhea [x2], muscle twitch), were all Grade 1 in severity, and bloating, 
1 instance of intermittent diarrhea, and intermittent belching were considered to be related to 
LOXO -305 and rifampin. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events resolved prior 
to End of Treatment (EOT; preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s 
development).

disposition due to their renal disease and severity of disease. Results from this study will 
provide information on the safety, tolerability, and exposure of LOXO -305 in participants 
with renal impairment and participants with normal renal function.  
 
Renal clearance of LOXO -305 in male and female rats was negligible. No data on renal 
clearance are available in other species; however, the renal excretion pathway is often 
conserved across species, and therefore no renal clearance would be expected in humans. In 
consideration of this, subjects with renal impairment assessed as severe (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate [eGFR]: < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), along with matched -control healthy subjects 
with normal renal function, will begin enrolling into the study first. If a clinically relevant 
difference is observed in the PK of subject(s) with severe renal impairment compared to 
matched -control healthy subjects during continuous review of the safety and PK data, then 
subjects with renal impairment assessed as mild (60 ≤ eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and/or 
moderate (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), along with additional matched -control healthy 
subjects (if needed) will be enrolled, to determine the extent of the effect of varying severities 
of renal impairment on the PK of LOXO -305. Enrollment of subjects with mild and/or 
moderate renal impairment will only be initiated if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_132191] -control healthy subjects. If no clinically relevant effect on PK is observed, 
enrollment of mild and/or moderate subjects will not occur.  
 
The PK profile of subjects with impaired renal function will be compared to subjects with  
normal renal function (eGFR: ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
1.6. Risk  Assessment  
 
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment 
of their medical status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are 
primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may 
also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. More 
information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs 
associated with LOXO -305 may be found in the  IB.1 
Single doses of 200 mg LOXO -305 were investigated in a study conducted in healthy 
volunteers (LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]) where 10 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of 
LOXO -305 on 3 separate days, each followed by a washout period. Two additional studies 
are ongoing in healthy volunteers (LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] and LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]).  
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] is a drug -drug interaction study evaluating the effects of a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) and a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) on the PK of 
LOXO -305 where, at the time of protocol development, 6 healthy volunteers were given 1 
dose of 200 mg of LOXO -305, 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 2 
separate days (1 of which was co -administered with itraconazole), each followed by a 
washout period, and 9 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 on 3 separate 
days (2 of which were co -administered with rifampin), each followed by a washout period. 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] is a SAD study evaluating the safety and tolerability of LOXO -305 at 
300 mg, up to 600 mg, up to 800 mg, and up to 900 mg (if necessary) where, at the time of 
protocol development 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 300 mg LOXO -305 
and 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 600 mg LOXO -305.

From AE data reported following LOXO -305 administration in 10 healthy volunteers in the 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study, all TEAEs (headache, nausea, and vomiting) were Grade [ADDRESS_149300] and 
resolved within 1 to 1.5 days (data on file at the time of protocol development). From 
preliminary AE data reported following LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers in 
the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study, all TEAEs (intermittent belching, bloating, insect bite, 
aphthous ulcer, nausea, intermittent diarrhea [x2], muscle twitch) were Grade 1 in severity 
and bloating, intermittent diarrhea, and intermittent belching were considered related to 
LOXO -305. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events resolved prior to EOT (data 
on file at the time of protocol development). From preliminary AE data reported following 
LOXO -305 administration in healthy volunteers in Cohort 1 of the LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] study, 
there was one TEAE (headache) observed in the 300 mg LOXO -305 cohort which was  
Grade 1 in severity and considered related to LOXO -305. The event resolved within 2 hours 
(data on file at the time of protocol development).  
 
The safety monitoring practices employed will include AE reporting, vital sign 
measurements, [ADDRESS_149301] the subjects’ safety.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and  Plan  
 
This study is an open -label, nonrandomized, multi -center, single -dose, parallel -group study to 
determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of LOXO -305 administered orally at a dose  of 
200 mg to fasted adult males and females with impaired renal function and healthy subjects 
with normal renal function. Renal function will be classified based on the baseline eGFR 
calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD -EPI) study 
equation.10 Baseline eGFR will be obtained for all subjects (ie, subjects with renal 
impairment and matched -control healthy subjects) by [CONTACT_132192] a 3 -month period 
from Screening. If no historical eGFR value is available, a second Screening eGFR 
sample will be taken during the Screening period (  14 days apart) and the mean of the 
[ADDRESS_149303] fall 
within the specified eGFR ranges for each group (ie, matched -control healthy subjects and 
subjects with severe renal impairment [and subjects with mild and/or moderate renal 
impairment, if they are enrolled]) to categorize subjects’ renal impairment status. The eGFR 
based on CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_132169] -in (Day -1) to confirm renal 
impairment status. For matched -control healthy subjects, a single assessment of actual 
creatinine clearance computed over a [ADDRESS_149304] of the 
eGFR (based on the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]), at the Investigator’s (or designee’s)  discretion.  
Subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 4), and matched -control healthy subjects with 
normal renal function (Group 1) will begin enrolling in the study first. Subjects will be 
recruited so that up to [ADDRESS_149305] 6 matched -control healthy subjects complete the study.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their eGFR values calculated 
using the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]10 at Screening and repeated at Check -in (Day -1) as judged by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee), Covance Medical Monitor, and Sponsor:  
 
• Group 1: Matched -control healthy subjects with normal renal function  (eGFR:  
≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
• Group 4: Subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR: < 30 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
Continuous review of the safety data and PK data (if available) from up to [ADDRESS_149306] completed all study -related assessments 
through 72 hours (approximately 3 half -lives) postdose, at a minimum. The safety data will 
include AEs and serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and clinical 
laboratory evaluations.  
 
Following continuous review of the safety data and PK data from up to 8 subjects with severe 
renal impairment (Group 4) and up to 8 matched -control healthy subjects with normal renal 
function (Group 1), subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 2) and/or moderate renal 
impairment in (Group 3) may be enrolled if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034]. If no clinically  
Protocol  
Covance Study: 8419692  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ADDRESS_149307] on PK is observed in subjects in Group 1 and Group 4, enrollment of subjects 
in Group 2 and/or Group 3 will not occur.  
 
If the Sponsor deems it necessary to enroll subjects with mild and/or moderate renal 
impairment, subjects will be recruited so that up to [ADDRESS_149308] 6 subjects with moderate renal impairment 
and their matched -control healthy subjects complete the study. Enrollment and dosing for 
subjects in Group 2 and/or Group [ADDRESS_149309](s) 
in Group 1 and Group 4 through a minimum of 72 hours postdose are reviewed and the 
Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed 
with dosing.  
 
Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their eGFR values calculated 
using the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]10 at Screening and repeated at Check -in (Day -1) as judged by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee), Covance Medical Monitor, and Sponsor:  
 
• Group 2: Subjects with mild renal impairment (60 ≤ eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate renal impairment (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73  m2) 
Baseline eGFR will be obtained for all subjects (ie, subjects with renal impairment and 
matched -control healthy subjects) by [CONTACT_132188] a 3 -month period from Screening. 
If no historical eGFR value is available, a second Screening eGFR sample will be taken 
during the Screening period (  14 days apart) and the mean of the [ADDRESS_149310] fall within the specified 
eGFR ranges for each group (ie, matched -control healthy subjects and subjects with severe 
renal impairment [and subjects with mild and/or moderate renal impairment, if they are 
enrolled]) to categorize subjects’ renal impairment status. The eGFR based on CKD -EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_132169] -in (Day -1) to confirm renal impairment status. For 
matched -control healthy subjects, a single assessment of actual creatinine clearance 
computed over a [ADDRESS_149311] of the eGFR (based on the 
CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]), at the Investigator’s (or designee’s) discretion.  
 
Each matched -control healthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by 
[CONTACT_654] (± 10 years), body mass index (BMI; ± 20%), and sex to the completed renal impairment 
subject(s). Should another renal impairment subject be identified with whom an already 
enrolled healthy subject is demographically matched, the healthy subject may also be 
matched with that impaired subject as long as the impaired subject is in a different renal 
impairment group. Each subject with normal renal function may be matched with up to [ADDRESS_149312] who is enrolled in the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). 
Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned a dose of study 
drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects. Replacement subjects may be enrolled 
only if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1034].

To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 
(Check -in). Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened 
if the Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor and the 
Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened 
subjects will be provided a new subject number.  
 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day -1) until EOT on Day 8 
upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early Termination (ET) if the subject 
discontinues. Subjects will be dosed on Day 1. A follow -up phone call will occur for all 
subjects who received a dose of study drug (including subjects who are terminated early)  
7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET. The duration of participation is expected to be up to 
46 days (Screening through follow -up phone call).  
 
On the morning of Day  1, after at least an [ADDRESS_149313], a single oral dose of 200 mg 
LOXO -305 will be administered with approximately 240 mL of water. No food will be 
allowed for up to 2 hours postdose. Glucose tablets may be administered as needed for 
treatment of hypoglycemia in renally impaired subjects with diabetes. For instructions 
regarding food and water intake, refer to Section 6.2 . Pharmacokinetic samples will be 
obtained through 168 hours postdose.

Note: Single oral dose of LOXO -[ADDRESS_149314].  
 
In this study, physical examinations, 12 -lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, How Do You 
Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology 
panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2 ), and recording of concomitant medications will be 
performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and details on each 
study variable, refer to Appendix 4 ). 
 
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events 
will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS],

A Schedule of Assessments is presented in Appendix [ADDRESS_149315]’s follow -up. 
 
3.2. Discussion of Study  Design  
 
A single -dose, parallel design is the standard design to investigate the PK of a drug in 
subjects with renal impairment. A parallel design is required to include subjects with renal 
impairment and matched -control healthy subjects with normal renal function. A single dose 
level of 200 mg LOXO -305 will be used because it is the dose intended for registration. The 
study will be open -label because the primary endpoints are objective rather than subjective.  
 
Matched -control healthy subjects with normal renal function will be enrolled in this study to 
serve as a reference group for interpretation of the results. Based on nonclinical and clinical 
data, and the known PK profile of the compound, the duration of the treatment period is 
considered adequate to achieve the study objectives.1 Oral doses were chosen because this is 
the intended clinical route of administration.  
 
Renal clearance of LOXO -305 in male and female rats was negligible. No data on renal 
clearance are available in other species; however, the renal excretion pathway is often 
conserved across species, and therefore no renal clearance would be expected in humans. In 
consideration of this, subjects with renal impairment assessed as severe (eGFR:  
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), along with matched -control healthy subjects, will begin enrolling into 
the study first. If a clinically relevant difference is observed in the PK of subject(s) with 
severe renal impairment compared to matched -control healthy subjects during continuous 
review of the safety and PK data, then subjects with renal impairment assessed as mild (60 ≤ 
eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and/or moderate (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), along with 
additional matched -control healthy subjects (if needed) will be enrolled, to determine the 
extent of the effect of varying severities of renal impairment on the PK of LOXO -305. 
Enrollment of subjects with mild and/or moderate renal impairment will only be initiated if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_132193] -control healthy subjects (see 
Section 8.2 ). If no clinically relevant effect on PK is observed, enrollment of mild and/or 
moderate subjects will not occur.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study 
LOXO -305 
Single oral doses of 200 mg LOXO -305 will be evaluated as this dose level given QD has 
been chosen as the recommended Phase 2 dose for the ongoing global Phase 1/[ADDRESS_149316]-in-human study, LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] (BRUIN Study). Doses of LOXO -[ADDRESS_149317] been evaluated in the ongoing global Phase 1/[ADDRESS_149318] -in-human study, 
LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE] (BRUIN Study) in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL or NHL 
with dose escalation up to 300 mg QD approved by [CONTACT_1758]’s Safety Review Committee.

4.6. Removal of Subjects from Study  Participation  
 
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for 
any reason. The Investigator (or designee) may remove a subject from the study if, in the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue 
the study. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the following:  
 
• change in compliance with inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant and 
affects subject  safety  
• occurrence of  AEs 
• occurrence of  pregnancy  
• intake of non -permitted concomitant medication that might affect subject safety or 
study assessments/objectives,  etc. 
 
Notification of withdrawal will immediately be made to the Study Monitor. In case of 
withdrawal, efforts will be made to perform all ET assessments ( Appendix 4 ). The date the

assessed as related to study drug and which are ongoing at ET may continue to be followed 
until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_3786] (or designee) and confirmed by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
The entire study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee), 
Sponsor, or Covance Medical Monitor based on the occurrence of the following:  
 
• adverse events unknown to date with respect to their nature, severity, and/or  duration  
• increased frequency and/or severity and/or duration of known  AEs 
• medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the  study  
• difficulties in the recruitment of  subjects  
• cancellation of drug  development  
In the event that the study is terminated early, the Sponsor or its designee will provide 
specific guidance to the CRU regarding the EOS procedures.  
 
4.7. Matching  Process  
 
A matched -control healthy subject will be matched to the completed renal impairment 
subject(s) (age [± 10 years], BMI [± 20%], and sex). An individual matched -control healthy 
subject may be matched with up to [ADDRESS_149336] within each renal impairment group (ie, to a 
maximum of 3 renally impaired subjects across the study [1 mild, 1 moderate, and 1 severe], 
but to no more than [ADDRESS_149337] in each impairment group). A listing of the matched subjects 
will be included in the Clinical Study Report.

dose container by [CONTACT_132203]. Each unit dose container will be appropriately 
labeled.  
 
5.2. Study Treatment  Administration  
 
Subjects will receive a single dose of LOXO -305, given orally as two 100 -mg tablets 
(200 mg total dose) in the morning on Day 1.  
 
The study drug will be administered orally with approximately [ADDRESS_149338] 8 hours from food (not including water) and will be followed by a fast from food 
(not including water) for up to 2 hours postdose. Water will be restricted for 1 -hour predose 
and 1 -hour postdose, with the exception of water administered for dose administration.  
Glucose tablets may be administered as needed for treatment of hypoglycemia in renally 
impaired subjects with diabetes.  
 
Each unit dose will be prepared by [CONTACT_132204].  
 
Appropriate unit dose(s), as described above, will be administered to subjects. Although the 
timing of events requires that each subject will be administered the appropriate dose at a 
specific time, the exact dose time of subjects may be staggered to obviate the need to have all 
subjects on precisely the same study schedule. For each dose, the subject’s actual dose time 
will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the eCRF.

samples will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual. The number of blood samples and 
total blood volume required for PK testing and unbound LOXO -305 is presented in  
Appendix 3 . 
 
7.1.2.  Analytical  Methodology  
 
Concentrations of LOXO -305 in plasma will be determined using a validated bioanalytical 
method. Specifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a separate document. The 
concentrations of total and unbound LOXO -305 will be determined in a sample of predose 
plasma fortified with a known concentration of LOXO -305. The f u will be calculated based 
on total and unbound LOXO -305 levels. Samples of plasma may be analyzed for exploratory 
analyses of metabolites. If such analyses are conducted, the results will be reported separately 
by [CONTACT_16049].  
 
7.2. Safety and Tolerability  Assessments  
 
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Covance Medical Monitor, 
Investigator (or designee), or Sponsor.  
 
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, 
and any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for 
scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority):  
 
• dosing  
• PK blood  sampling  
• vital sign  measurements  
• 12-lead ECGs  
• blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory  evaluations  
• physical  examination.  
7.2.1.  Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and 
procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1 .

Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version 2.0, 17 February 2021  Page 52 of 75   
  
Subjects will be asked a non -leading HDYF? question such as “Have there been any changes 
in your health status since Screening/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4  (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in [Day -1], at each 
postdose vital sign measurement, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will 
also be encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS.  
 
Adverse events, whether volunteered, identified by [CONTACT_423]’s responses to HDYF? 
inquiries, or noted on physical examination, ECG, vital sign measurements, or clinical 
laboratory evaluations, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF 
until EOS [or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a  
follow -up phone call]), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning 
prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as not related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]) or as AEs 
(if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as related to study procedures by [CONTACT_737] [or designee], or if the event 
occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship 
to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF 
signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a 
follow -up phone call) are to be reported.  
 
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study and does not complete the 
follow -up phone call, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are 
assessed as related to study drug by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) which are ongoing at EOS 
may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable 
levels, as judged by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and confirmed by [CONTACT_1034]. The 
Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as 
necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety 
tests be performed.  
 
Subjects will receive a follow -up phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine 
if any SAE or drug -related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.  
 
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator (or designee).  
 
Any event that meets the criteria of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to CRU policy 
by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) and to regulatory authorities by [CONTACT_1034] (or Sponsor 
designee) according to regulatory authority requirements. Refer to Reference Safety 
Information in the current IB for LOXO -305 for additional safety information. 1 
7.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory  Evaluations

Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, HBV IgM core antibody, and HIV antibody will be 
performed at Screening.  
 
Testing for COVID -19 via PCR or antigen testing (or equivalent, as determined by [CONTACT_3786] [or designee] with agreement from the Sponsor) will be performed at the 
timepoints specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_149343]’s CRU confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or 
designee). Further details regarding COVID -19 testing (including procedures for subjects 
who test positive at any time throughout CRU confinement) are specified in a separate 
document.  
 
A urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine [matched -control healthy 
subjects only] and alcohol [urine or breath test]) will be performed at Screening and repeated 
at Check -in (Day -1) for all subjects. A serum qualitative or urine qualitative pregnancy test 
(female subjects only [quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin tests may be used 
for confirmation as needed and post -menopausal subjects may be eligible for participation if 
the results of the qualitative serum pregnancy or qualitative urine pregnancy test are positive 
but the quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin results are within the laboratory’s 
reference ranges for post -menopausal women]) and an FSH test (post -menopausal female 
subjects only) will be performed at the timepoints specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_149344] of the specific evaluations is in Appendix 2 . 
 
7.2.3.  Vital  Signs  
 
Vital sign measurements (including body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen saturation, 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991], and pulse rate) will be obtained at the timepoints specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_149345] 5 minutes.  
 
When vital sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood 
draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital sign measurements will be 
obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled blood draw.  
 
7.2.4.  12-lead Electrocardiogram  
 
A 12 -lead ECG (including heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) will be 
obtained after the subject has been resting for at least 10 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_132179] 4 . The QT interval will be corrected for heart rate by 
[CONTACT_6550]’s (QTcF = QT/[RR]1/3) formula.  
When 12 -lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be 
obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained prior to and as 
close as possible to the scheduled blood draw.

8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA  ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample  Size 
 
A total of up to 24 subjects with renal impairment (up to 8 subjects with severe impairment, 
and, if necessary, up to 8 subjects with moderate impairment, and/or up to 8 subjects with 
mild impairment, per eGFR using the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]) and approximately [ADDRESS_149346]. Continuous review of the safety data and PK 
data (if available) from up to [ADDRESS_149347] completed all study -related assessments through 72 hours (approximately 3 
half-lives) postdose, at a minimum. The safety data will include AEs and SAEs, vital signs, 
physical examinations, ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations.  
 
If a clinically relevant difference is observed in the PK of subject(s) with severe renal 
impairment compared to matched -control healthy subjects during continuous review of the 
safety and PK data, then subjects with renal impairment assessed as mild (60 ≤ eGFR  
< 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and/or moderate (30 ≤ eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), along with 
additional matched -control healthy subjects (if needed) will be enrolled, to determine the 
extent of the effect of varying severities of renal impairment on the PK of LOXO -305. 
Enrollment of subjects with mild and/or moderate renal impairment will only be initiated if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_132193] -control healthy subjects. If no 
clinically relevant effect on PK is observed, enrollment of mild and/or moderate subjects will 
not occur.  
 
Enrollment and dosing for remaining subjects in Group 2 and/or Group 3 may only occur 
after the data for Group 1 and Group 4 are reviewed and the Covance Medical Monitor, 
Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed with dosing.  
 
Subjects will be recruited for Group 2 and/or Group [ADDRESS_149348] 6 subjects with moderate 
renal impairment and their matched -control healthy subjects complete the study.  
 
Teleconferences will occur as needed between the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or 
designee), and Sponsor to discuss PK, safety, and tolerability data.

Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed using commercial software such as Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin® Version 8.1 or higher (Certara [LOCATION_003] Inc.).  
Other parameters may be added as appropriate. Final PK parameters reported will be detailed 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. All statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 or greater. More details on the analyses 
will be included in the SAP.  
 
8.4.1.  Descriptive  Analysis  
 
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_132206] (number, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation [CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). In 
addition, summary statistics for unbound LOXO -305 will be tabulated by [CONTACT_132207].  
 
8.4.2.  Statistical  Methodology  
 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO -305 after a single 
dose in subjects with renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.  
 
Paired t -tests will be performed to assess the differences in PK parameters (AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, 
and C max) between each renal impairment group versus the corresponding matched -control 
healthy group with respect to 1 to 1 matching. The analysis will be based on the natural log 
(ln)-transformed PK parameters. Geometric mean ratios and their corresponding 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated using the exponentiation of the mean difference 
and the CIs obtained for the difference in mean between each renal impairment group and the 
matching healthy control group.  
 
In addition, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the ln -transformed 
AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. The ANCOVA model will contain a categorical factor of 
population for subjects with varied -degree renal impairment (severe, moderate, and mild) and 
matched -control healthy subjects, a categorical covariate (sex), and continuous covariates 
(age and BMI). Ratios of least squares means and 90% CIs will be calculated using the 
exponentiation of the difference between renal function cohort least squares means from the 
ANCOVA analyses on the ln -transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, and C max. In addition, an 
ANCOVA will be performed on the ln -transformed AUC 0-t,u, AUC 0-inf,u, and C max,u. 
 
The relationship between LOXO -305 PK parameters (ie, C max and AUC) and measures of 
renal function (such as eGFR and creatinine clearance) may be explored using a linear 
regression approach or other methods. The effect of covariates such as age, BMI, and sex 
may be investigated.

Appendix 1: Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienced by a patient or healthy adult subject, whether or not considered drug -related by 
[CONTACT_737] (or designee). A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that 
starts on or after the first administration of study drug.  
 
The following are all AEs:  
 
• unfavorable changes in general  condition  
• subjective or objective  signs/symptoms  
• concomitant diseases or  accidents  
• clinically significant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
during a clinical  study.  
 
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective 
disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_737] [or designee]), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, 
irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance.  
 
Categorization of Adverse Events  
 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows:  
 
• Grade 1 Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not  indicated  
• Grade 2 Moderate: Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living  (ADL)*  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL**  
• Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences: An event that puts the subject at 
immediate risk of  death  
• Grade 5 Death related to  AE. 
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_132182], or clothes, using the telephone, managing money,  etc. 
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

Protocol Reference:  LOXO -BTK -[ZIP_CODE]  
Protocol Version 2.0, 17 February 2021  Page 66 of 75   
  
The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2 -category system according to the following guidelines:  
 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the administration of investigational 
product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) 
is suspected  
• RELATED = The time course between administration of investigational product 
and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship 
and no other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, comorbidities) 
can be  identified  
 
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
 
Pregnancy  
 
As information is available, a pregnancy (including pregnancy in female partners of male 
subjects) diagnosed through End of Study or Early Termination (ET; if the subject 
discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call) and for up to  
90 days after Day 1 should be reported by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) via email to Covance 
or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of being notified. Covance or 
the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will then forward the Pregnancy Form to the 
Investigator (or designee) for completion.  
 
emai l: [EMAIL_2654]  
 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the 
study and ET study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be followed 
by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for 
any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator (or designee) should notify Covance 
or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the 
Investigator (or designee) will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious adverse event (SAE; an 
SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the Investigator (or designee) should follow the procedures for 
reporting an SAE.  
 
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator (or designee) immediately if they 
discover their sexual partner is pregnant. In this instance, the partner must provide written 
consent before pregnancy information can be collected. When a Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) becomes aware that the female partner of a male subject is pregnant, they are to 
contact [CONTACT_737] (or designee) immediately (within 24 hours of the CRU staff 
becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical 
Safety Representative via email.  
 
All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE electronic Case Report Form (as appropriate), 
in addition to completion of the required pregnancy forms. If the Investigator (or designee) 
suspects that a pregnancy was the result of an interaction between the study treatment and the  
Protocol  
Covance Study: 8419692  CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Version 2.0, 17 February 2021  Page 67 of 75   
  
contraceptive method, in addition to the pregnancy the drug interaction should also be 
captured as a separate AE.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
 
An SAE (by [CONTACT_7214] [FDA] definition) is any adverse drug experience 
occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of  death)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
• A persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the above  outcomes  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
 
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed 
in the Reference Safety Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure or if it is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed for an unapproved investigational 
medicinal product.  
 
Reporting  
 
Food and Drug Administration -reportable AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that are assessed as serious, related, and unexpected. Food and 
Drug Administration -reportable AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_132220] (IRB). Final determination of whether an event 
represents a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) will be the 
responsibility of the Sponsor.  
 
Within [ADDRESS_149355] recognized or 
reported, and within 24 hours of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is assessed as 
related or unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, Covance or the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will be notified by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) in 
writing using the following email address:

Appendix 5: Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes  
 
Protocol Version 2.0 (dated 17 February 2021) incorporated the following changes in 
Protocol Version 1.0 (dated 29 October 2020):  
 
• A reference to the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_132186].  
• The version of the Investigator Brochure referenced has been updated and the 
Protocol has been updated based on this and data from ongoing clinical  studies.  
• Allowance of qualitative urine pregnancy testing, in addition to serum qualitative 
pregnancy  testing.  
• Clarification that post -menopausal female subjects requiring a quantitative serum 
human chorionic gonadotropin test may be eligible for participation in the study if the 
values fall within the normal ranges for post -menopausal  females.  
• Exclusion criterion #35 has been updated to exclude patients with severe renal 
impairment with a QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s method 
of > 470 msec, instead of > 480  msec.  
• An additional electrocardiogram assessment has been added at 3 hours postdose on 
Day 1.  
• Clarification that polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing for SARS -CoV -2 
(COVID -19) can be used to confirm there is no active  infection.

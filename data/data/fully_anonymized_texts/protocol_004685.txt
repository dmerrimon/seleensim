CLINICAL STUDY SUMMARY 
The AFREZZA pediatric study MKC -TI-155 consists of 2 parts:  
• Part 1 is a Phase 2, open -label, single -arm, multiple -dose safety, titration, and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
study of AFREZZA in pediatric subjects ages 4 to 17 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus  (T1DM).  
• Part 2 is a Phase 3, 52 -week, open -label, randomized, mul tinational, clinical study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of AFREZZA (insulin human) inhalation powder in combination with a basal 
insulin versus insulin aspart in combination with a basal insulin in pediatric subjects with type 1 or 
type 2 diabetes me llitus. The design of the Phase 3 study may be modified based on the results from 
Part 1. Design for the Phase 3 study is in development (Section 18.3 - Appendix C). 
 
 
STUDY NUMBER MKC -TI-155 Part 1 
COMPOUND:  AFREZZA® (insulin human) Inhalation Powder  
STUDY TITLE  Open -label, single -arm, multiple -dose safety, titration, and 
pharmacokinetic study of AFREZZA® in pediatric subjects ages 
4 to 17 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus  
INVESTIGATOR/STUDY 
LOCATION  [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  2 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  • Assess the safety and tolerability of AFREZZA in children 
ages 4 to 17 years with T1DM  
• Assess PK following a prandial dose of AFREZZA  in 
children ages 4 to 17 years with T1DM  
• Assess the ability to titrate the prandial and  supplemental 
dose of AFREZZA at each meal using  postprandial  
self-monitored blood glucose values obtained 120 to 
150 minutes after each prandial dose of AFREZZA in 
children ages 4 to 17 years with T1DM  
STUDY DESIGN  Part 1 of the study will be a single -arm, multi -center, open -label, 
uncontrolled study to evaluate PK, safety, and ability to titrate 
AFREZZA® in children ages 4 to 17 years with T1DM, who 
were previously on a regimen of basal -bolus insulin therapy 
adminis tered by [CONTACT_213428] (MDI).  
On Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of AFREZZA prior 
to PK sampling. There will be 3 different doses of AFREZZA for 
the PK study. The AFREZZA® dose (4, 8, or 12 units) will be 
based on the dose of subcuta neous (SC) rapid- acting analog 
(RAA) that the subject would usually receive with breakfast.  
During the 4- week titration period following the PK visit, each  
subject will be titrated with AFREZZA according to the titration

 rules given.  
The study will be conducted sequentially in age cohorts 
beginning with Cohort 1 and then proceeding to Cohort 2 and 
Cohort 3 in parallel. Approximately 46 subjects will be enrolled 
into 3 age cohorts:  
Cohort 1: 13 to 17 years ; approximately [ADDRESS_567382] be dosed 
(complete PK Visit 2). Of those, at least [ADDRESS_567383] the 8 unit dose.  
Cohort 2: 8 to 12 years ; approximately 14 subjects distributed 
across 4, 8, and 12 unit starting dose groups, as derived from the 
insulin:carb ratio – Figure 1 (the sample size may be adapted 
after taking the PK data from Cohort 1 into account)..  
Cohort 3: 4 to 7 years ; approximately 14 subjects will be treated 
and assessed for AFREZZA with a starting dose of distributed across 4, 8, and 12 unit starting dose groups, as derived from the 
insulin:carb ratio – Figure 1. The sample size may be adapted 
after evaluating the PK data from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.  
The study consists of:  
• Up to 3- week screening  period 
• PK assessment period: 1 day, after a single dose  of 
AFREZZA
® 
• Dose titration period: approximately a 4 -week period with 
multiple doses of  AFREZZA  
• A follow -up visit will occur approximately 1 week after the 
end of AFREZZA treatment for safety assessments (duration 1 day) 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]  
• Administration of AFREZZA in any dose group(s) of an 
age cohort may be halted if the Sponsor or data safety 
monitoring committee (DMC) considers a dose group or age 
cohort to be unsafe or that it is unreasonable to continue.  
• The study may also be stopped i f the Sponsor or DMC 
considers it not appropriate to proceed to the next age 
cohorts based on safety, PK, or titration data.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE  The schedule of study -related procedures/assessments is detailed 
in the study flow chart.  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  Sample size determination:  
Sample size calculation is based on a total standard deviation 
(SD Total) of 0.725 for the log- transformed apparent total body 
clearance (CL/F). The sample size is planned to target the 
maximum imprecision of the 95% confidence interval for the geometric me an estimates of CL/F in each age cohort within 
40%, with at least 80%  power.  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_567389] 80% power in order to target the maximum imprecision  of 
the 95% confidence interval of the geometric mean es timates 
within 40%, assuming an SD
Total of 0.[ADDRESS_567390] 
conservative approach. For Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, the sample size may be adjusted to enable taking the PK variability in 
previous cohorts into account.  
Analysis population:  
All subjects in the cl inical study who receive a dose of  
MKC -TI-155 Pa rt 1  
AFREZZA® Inhalation Powder  14February2018  
Protocol Amendment  3 
Page 9 of 72  
  
 AFREZZA will be included in the safety population . 
All subjects without any major deviations related to study drug 
administration (no sneezing or coughing right after AFREZZA 
inhalation on Day 1), and for whom any PK parameters are 
available, will be included in the PK population.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis:  
All analyses will be performed in a descriptive manner based on 
the PK population.  
Safety analyses:  
Analyses will be performed in a descriptive manner by [CONTACT_299889].  
The safety analysis will be conducted on the safety population 
and will be based on the r eview of the individual values 
(clinically significant abnormalities) and descriptive statistics 
(summary tables and plots if appropriate). Individual values will 
be flagged for potentially clinically significant abnormalities 
and treatment -emergent advers e events will be tabulated (counts 
and percent).The details of the analyses for the study will be 
specified in the Statistics and Analysis Plan (SAP) for the  study.  
DURATION OF STUDY  
PERIOD (per subject)  The total duration of the study will be approximately [ADDRESS_567391] through the 4- week titration period.  
STUDY COMMITTEES  Data Monitoring Committee: an independent group of experts 
will be responsible for monitoring the safety of the subjects enrolled in the clinical trial on an on -going basis in order to 
provide, in a timely fashion, appropriate recommendations to the Sponsor.

4 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
 
4.1 INTRODUCTION  
In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the therapeutic objective is to optimally control blood 
glucose levels and this objective is fundamentally the same in all subjects with T1DM. However, 
individual circumstances and needs dictate what those optimal levels  should be. Children and 
adolescents with T1DM are dependent on insulin for survival (1 ), (2), (3), (4). Children and 
adolescents experience phases of growth and pubertal development associated with substantial 
changes in metabolism and, consequently, insulin requirements (5 ), (6). 
 
AFREZZA® inhalation powder (hereafter referred to as AFREZZA®) consists of recombinant 
human insulin adsorbed onto fumaryl diketopi[INVESTIGATOR_3746] (FDKP), a novel excipi[INVESTIGATOR_446188], at acidic pH, self -assembles into particles, and polysorbate 80. AFREZZA
® is administered by [CONTACT_13243] l 
inhalation using a breath-powered inhaler. AFREZZA® particles have a median diameter of 
approximately 2 to 2.5 µm, a size appropriate for inhalation into the lung. Following inhalation, 
AFREZZA® particles dissolve immediately at the physiologic pH of the  lung, and insulin and 
FDKP are absorbed systemically.  
 
AFREZZA® is currently available in cartridges labeled as “4 units”, “8 units”, and “12 units”. 
The actual contents are 10 units human insulin in a “4 unit cartridge”, 20 units in an “8 unit 
cartridge”, and 30 units in a “12 unit cartridge”.  
 
AFREZZA® received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of adults 
18 years or older with T1DM or type 2 diabetes. In subjects with T1DM, AFREZZA® must be 
used with a long -acting basal insulin formulation. After administration of AFREZZA® in adults, 
the maximum serum insulin concentration occurs in approximately 12 to 15 minutes (versus 45 
to 60 minutes for rapid-acting analog [RAA] insulin via subcutaneous [SC] route) and returns to 
near baseline levels in approximately 180 minutes (versus about 5 hours for RAA) (7 ). 
 
Because of its more rapid kinetics, AFREZZA® may be potentially more useful as a first -phase 
prandial insulin replacement than injectable prandial insulins. Basing AFREZZA® dosing on 
self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) readings done [ADDRESS_567408] -dose takes both  
the pre -meal glucose and the rise of blood glucose after a meal into account, and represents a new 
treatment and monitoring paradi gm. Postprandial or “follow -on” AFREZZA® dosing following 
meals based on these postprandial SMBG readings may also offer the possibility to correct 
postprandial glucose elevations without the “stacking” of insulin.  
 
4.2 RATIONALE  
MKC -TI-155 Part 1 is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of 
AFREZZA® in children with T1DM ages 4 to 17 years who are on a stable regimen of  
basal -bolus insulin therapy administered by [CONTACT_213428] (MDI). The  study is 
intended to gain initial experience with AFREZZA® regarding the ability to dose -titrate in 
children. The data from this study will help determine the appropriate age range for inclusion,  
MKC -TI-155 Pa rt 1

and recommended dosing for a 1-year pediatric efficacy and safety study (MKC -TI-155 Part 2). 
The study design for Part 2 is in development (Section 18.3 – Appendix C).  
 
 
4.3 POTENTIAL  BENEFITS  
The potential benefits of AFREZZA® over current treatment modalities with SC insulin include 
an improved compliance to treatment and a reduced incidence of hypoglycemia with similar 
overall glycemic control as assessed by [CONTACT_252750] A1c (HbA1c) levels.  
 
 
4.4 IMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISKS AND ASSESSMENT  PLAN  
Safety of AFREZZA® has not been evaluated in children. The potential risk(s) of AFREZZA® 
based on the results of the studies done in adults may include the following (Table 1 ): 
 
Table  1 Risk and Assessment/Mitigation  plan 
 
Risk  Assessment/mitigation plan  
Important Identified risks   
Bronchospasm in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease   
The long -term safety and efficacy of AFREZZA® in 
subjects with chronic lung disease has not been 
established.  Acute bronchospasm has been obser ved i n subjects with asthma and chr onic obstr uctive pul monar y 
disease (COPD) using AFREZZA
®. Because of the risk 
of acute bronchospasm, AFREZZA® is contra indicated 
in subjects with chronic lung disease such as asthma or  
COPD. The FDA- appr oved l abel has a boxed w ar ning  
expl aining the risk of acute bronchospasm in subjects 
with chronic lung disease.  Subjects with asthm a or a ny other clinically important 
pulmonary disease will not be enrolled in the study.  
Severe hypoglycemia

Risk  Assessment/mitigation plan  
In T1DM, the incidence of mild/moderate hypoglycemi a 
was significantly lower in TI Inha lation Powder -treated 
subjects than in those treated with sc insulin compa rator. 
The incidence of severe hypoglycemia  wa s compa rable between treatment groups ( 24. 2% for 
TI Inha lation 
Pow der and 28.3% for sc insulin compar ator). Event 
rates for severe hypoglycemi a were also comparabl e 
between the 2 groups (5.[ADDRESS_567409] - month, respectively). Event rates 
per [ADDRESS_567410] -month for mild/ moderate and severe 
hypoglycemia  were not significantly different between 
the [ADDRESS_567411] 4 weeks of treatment initi ati on and wer e associa ted with insufficient titra
tion. As is the ca se 
duri ng initiation of any insulin ther apy, bl ood glucose 
concentr ations shoul d be closely monitor ed on an 
indivi dual basis and dose adjustments should be made as necessary during initiation of TI Inhalation Powder.  Blood glucose will be  monitored using self -monitored 
blood glucose.  
 
 
 
 
Dose titra tion and supplement dose instruction will be 
given to subjects.  
  
Important potential risks   
Diabetic Ketoacidosis   
In clinica l studies in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
di abetic ketoaci dosis was more common in subjects 
receivi ng AFREZZA® (0. 43%; n= 13)  than i n subjects 
receivi ng comparators (0.14%; n=3). In subjects at risk 
for dia betic ketoacidosis, such as those with an acute 
illness or i nfection, increase the fr equency of glucose 
monitoring and consider delivery of insulin using an 
a lternate route of a dministration if indicated.  Blood glucose will be monitored using self -monitored 
blood glucose.  
 
 
 
 
Dose titra tion and supplement dose instruction will be 
given to subjects.

Risk  Assessment/mitigation plan  
In clinical studies i n adults, 2 cases of lung cancer, 1 i n 
controlled studies and 1 in uncontrolled studies ([ADDRESS_567412] -yea rs of exposure), were observed in 
pa rticipants exposed to AFREZZA®, while no cases of 
lung cancer were observed in comp arators ([ADDRESS_567413] -yea rs of exposure). In both cases, a prior 
history of heavy tobacco use w as i denti fied as a risk 
factor for lung cancer. Two additiona l ca ses of lung 
cancer (squamous cell) occurred in non -smokers 
exposed to AFREZZA® and we re reported by 
[CONTACT_446220] l study completion. These data 
a re insufficient to determine whether AFREZZA® has 
an effect on lung or respi[INVESTIGATOR_446189].  Cotinine is test at screening as part of entry criteria and 
monitored throughout the study.  
Dyspnea   
Dyspnea is an uncommon AE occurring in 1. 7% an d 
0.1% of TI Inha lation Powder subjects and compa rator - 
treated subjects with T1D M, respectivel y, and in 1. 2% 
and 0.4% of TI Inhal ati on P ow der and compar ator - 
treated subjects with T2DM, respectively. A rel ati v e ly 
higher inci dence of dyspnea in TI Inhal ati on P owder - 
treated subjects may have been influenced by [CONTACT_65464] - 
label design of these tria ls. It is possible that subjects 
receivi ng an inhaled product were more self -a wa re and 
reported more signs and symptom s than did those on 
usual sc injection or oral treatments.  All a dverse events will be collected a nd monitored throughout the study  
Hyperglycemia during acute illness or change of

TI Inhal ati on P ow der may be used duri ng inter curr ent 
illnesses, including upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_316808]. At 
such ti mes, more frequent monitoring of blood glucose 
concentr ations and dose adjustment may be required. If

Additional safety consideration:   
Decline in FEV1   
In clinical studies excl udi ng subjects with chronic lung

6 STUDY DESIGN 
 
6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE  PROTOCOL  
MKC -TI-155 Part 1 will be a single -arm,  multi-center,  open-label,  uncontrolled  study  to evaluate 
PK, safety,  and ability  to titrate  AFREZZA® in children  ages 4 to 17 years  with T1DM,  who were 
previously on a regimen  of basal -bolus  insulin  therapy  administered  by [CONTACT_90451].  
 
The structure of the study is as follows:  
 
• Single dose PK at  breakfast  
• 4-week titration period starting at lunch after PK  evaluation  
 
On Day 1, subjects will receive a single dose of AFREZZA® prior to PK sampling. There will be 
3 different doses of AFREZZA® for the PK study. The AFREZZA® dose (4, 8, or 12 units) will 
be based on the dose of SC RAA that the subject would usually receive with breakfast (Section 
8.1.3 ). After this starting dose, each subject will be titrated with AFREZZA® TI according to the 
titration rules given.  
 
The study will begin with Cohort 1 then proceed to Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 in parallel. Approximately 46 
subjects will be enrolled into 3 age cohorts:

8.1.1  AFREZZA (Insulin Human) inhalation powder and inhaler  
AFREZZA consists of single -use plastic cartridges filled with a white powder containing insulin, 
which is administered via oral inhalation using the AFREZZA Inhaler only.  
 
AFREZZA Inhalation Powder is a dry powder supplied as 4, 8, or [ADDRESS_567427] will be calculated based on the dosage chart (Figure 1 ). AFREZZA should be taken 
under Investigator’s supervision, immediately before the first bite of breakfast. The starting and 
ending time of breakfast will be recorded.  
 
A standardized meal will be provided to the subjects for their first dose of  
Afrezza. Carbohydrate should account for 50% of the meal content up to a maximum of  [ADDRESS_567428]: 
Cohort 1: 50 - 70g; 
Cohort 2: 40 - 60g; and,  
Cohort 3: 30 - 40g. 
The appropriate dose of Afrezza will be determined by [CONTACT_446226]/carbohydrate 
ratio in conjunction the with carb content of the meal per Figure 1.

8.1.4  Dose  titration  
AFREZZA® should be taken at the beginning of the meal. An individualized postprandial dose  
will be administered 120 to 150 min utes after the initial dose if the SMBG exceeds 180 mg/dL. 
For dose titration, initial doses for lunch and dinner on Day 1 will also be determined based on  the conversion table (Figure 1 ). 
 
Throughout the study, doses for each of the following 3 days’ meals will be titrated at the end of 
the current 3 -day period based on the median SMBG ([ADDRESS_567430] -dose) (Table 2 ). 
In other words, the subject will m easure his/her [ADDRESS_567431] -lunch SMBG for 3 days. 
The median dose (not the average dose, but the middle –  between highest and lowest - of the [ADDRESS_567432] values) will be used for dose adjustment per Table 2. This new dose should be used for the next [ADDRESS_567433] and dinner SMBG 
values.

If a subject’s SMBG is greater than or equal to 180 mg/dL, [ADDRESS_567434] should take an additional, individualized postprandial or follow -on dose. The 
dose should be sufficient to reduce blood glucose below 120 mg/ dL based on the subject’s 
individualized dose -response.  
 
 
8.1.6  Additional dosing of AFREZZA for snacks 
Additional AFREZZA dosing may or may not be required with snacks. The need for a dose and 
the size of the dose depends on the size and content of the snack and the individual’s  
dose -response.

An AESI is an adverse event (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern, specific to the IMP or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_446248]. Such events may require further investigation in 
order to characterize and understand them.  
 
For AESIs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately (i.e., within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification guidelines described in Section 10.3.2 , even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion as 
an SAE.  
 
The following adverse events are considered AESIs:  
 
• Acute  bronchospasm  
• Clinically relevant decline in pulmonary  function  
• Hypersensitivity  reactions,  including  anaphylaxis,  which  can occur  with insulin  products, 
including  AFREZZA  
 
• Diabetic  ketoacidosis  
 
10.2.4  Hypoglycemia  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions and reporting for hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia  
The general symptoms of hypoglycemia most subjects experience include 1 or more of the 
following: headache, dizziness, general feeling of weakness, drowsiness, confusion, pallor,  
MKC -TI-155 Pa rt 1  
AFREZZA® Inhalation Powder  14February2018  
Protocol Amendment  3 
Page 47 of 72  
  
irritability, trembling, sweating, lightheadedness, shaky, increased appetite, rapid heartbeat and a 
cold, clammy feeling. In severe cases, seizu re, loss of consciousness, or even coma can occur.  
 
The definitions  used  in this protocol  are based  on the Clinical Practice Consensus  Guidelines  2014 
of the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) (10 ). In the adult 
population, severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to 
actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. In childhood, this 
definition is problematic as most young children require assistance to correct even mild 
hypoglycemia. As a result, in the pediatric population, severe hypoglycemia is generally defined 
as an event associated with severe neuroglycopenia usually resulting in loss of con sciousness, 
coma, or seizure.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-severe hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_446200]-severe hypoglycemia is defined according to the ISPAD Clinical Practice Consensus 
Guidelines 2014 (10) as follows:  
 
• SMBG levels <70 mg/dL and/or  
• Symptoms of hypoglycemia that are relieved by [CONTACT_446249][INVESTIGATOR_446201]-severe  hypoglycemia  are to be 
recorded  in the e-Diary, and will be reported on the hypoglycemia  page  in the e-CRF.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_446202] 2014 (10) as an event associated with a seizure, coma, or loss of consciousness and 
will be considered  an SAE (see below).  If glucose  measurements  are not available  during  such  an 
event, the neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of glucose to normal will be 
cons idered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low glucose  concentration.  
 
The following epi[INVESTIGATOR_446203] e-CRFs and the hypoglycemia e -CRF. This applies for: 
 
• Hypoglycemia associated with coma or loss of consciousness,  or 
• Hypoglycemic seizure,  or 
• Hypoglycemia  that meets  other  conditions  for an SAE,  as defined  under  “Serious  Adverse 
Event” in Section  10.2.2  
The Investigator will adjudicate epi[INVESTIGATOR_446204] e -Diary that appear to 
meet the criteria for SAEs. If the Investigator judges that the epi[INVESTIGATOR_446205], it will be 
corrected on a data clarification form in the e -Diary and will not be recorded in an SAE e -CRF.

Cough as an isolated  symptom  will be reported  as an AE in the e-CRF.  For cough associated  with 
a defined clinical entity (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]), the appropriate diagnosis 
associated with the cough will be recorded in the AE e-CRF.  
 
 
10.3 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY  REPORTING  
 
10.3.1  General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, occurring between consent/assent 
and the end of the study will be recorded.  
 
AEs are to be recorded as defined by [CONTACT_446250] e-CRF for subjects who 
are enrolled and for those who fail screening.  
 
For screen failed subjects, recording in the e -CRF is only performed in case of an SAE occurring 
during the screening period or in case of a n AE when some study -specific screening procedures 
expose the subject to safety risks. Whenever possible, diagnosis or syndrome should be reported 
instead of individual associated symptoms (e.g., record “Influenza” not fever, chills, etc). The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity (see definitions in Section 10.2.1 ), action 
taken with respect to IMP/NIMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations 
performed, outcome, and Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_2203]/NIMP.  
 
In order to ensure the safety of the subjects, the Investigator should take appropriate measures to 
follow all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, 
or until no further improvement is expected, or until death. Follow -up of the AE resolution/status 
will end at the follow -up visit. If necessary, SAEs will be followed beyond the  last planned visit 
per protocol until resolution, no further improvement is expected, or death. Additional 
investigations of the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_16049].  
 
When  treatment  is prematurely  discontinued,  an early  termination  (ET) visit should be conducted 
as soon as possible. Laboratory, vital sign , or electrocardiogram abnormalities are to be recorded 
as AEs only  if: 
 
• Laboratory and/or vital signs not specifically addressed elsewhere in the protocol  change  
≥ 10 × the upper or the lower limits of normal and are undesired, and are a change from 
the pre -enrollment assessment values, and/or  
 
• Are symptomatic,  and/or

only females  who take appropriate  contraceptive  measures  may participate  in this clinical trial 
(See Inclusion Criteria  #12).  
 
This study consists  of [ADDRESS_567464] will be 
carried out for female participants in Cohort 1 (age s 13-17) and Cohort 2 (ages 8-12) at  the 
beginning  of the clinical trial and also several  times  during  the course  of the trial. However, 
early -stage pregnancies can only be reliably detected a few days after conception. Female 
participants  in Cohort  3 (ages  4-7) will not have  pregnancy  tests performed.  
 
Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria (Section 7.2 ) and none of the exclusion criteria 
(Section 7.3) will be eligible for the study.  
 
Subjects will receive a glucose meter, supplies and training for use during the study. Subjects 
will also receive an Electronic Diar y (e-diary) and be trained in its use. Instructions will be given 
on how and when to take blood glucose readings during the screening period and how to enter 
those reading into the e -diary.  
 
The PK visit will be scheduled and the subject will be reminded to bring their e -Diary to the PK 
visit. Five of seven fasting SMBG values obtained during the week prior to the PK visit must be 
between 80 and 250 mg/dL. Only the week (7 days) before the Day  [ADDRESS_567465]  for the study.  Subjects  will also be asked  to refrain  from  vigorous  physical  activity  within 
24 hours  of Visit 2 (Day  1), to fast overnight,  to maintain  their hydration (water  only),  to take any 
basal insulin the night before Visit 2, and to take no other medication in the morning of the PK visit.  
 
 
12.1.2  PK assessment period (Visit  2) 
Subjects who successfully completed screening will participate in Visit 2/PK visit. Study staff 
will confirm subjec t fasted overnight for at least 8 hours (only water is permitted), and the last 
dose  of basal  insulin  was administered  the night  before  Visit 2. Subjects  should test their glucose 
by [CONTACT_446254] 2. If their glucose is less than 80 
mg/dL, they  should call the clinic and reschedule their Visit [ADDRESS_567466] dose of AFREZZA: 
 
• Blood glucose determination: Fasting pre -breakfast SMBG on the day of Visit [ADDRESS_567467] 
be ≥80 mg/dL for the subject to participate in the PK assessment. However, if the SMBG 
value is >250 mg/dL, a urine sample will be checked for the presence of ketones using dipstick. If more than trace ketones are detected, the subject will not be permitted to 
proceed. The subject may return up to 2 more times on separate days to attempt to satisfy the SMBG  criteria.  
 
• Abbreviated physical exam and vital signs prior to Afrezza  dosing.  
• Urine pregnancy  testing  
MKC -TI-155 Pa rt 1

• Urine  cotinine  
• FEV 1 evaluation by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_038]: Successive spi[INVESTIGATOR_446208] 25 minutes before and 18, 55, 125, and 245 minutes after administration  
of AFREZZA to evaluate for possible acute changes in FEV 1 related to  dosing.  
Inhalation maneuver training: the BluHale system consists of an AFREZZA inhaler, an empty 
cartridge, and a pressure -sensing jacket that slips onto the inhaler. The jacket is designed for 
repeated use on multiple inhalers and does not require sterilization between subjects. Therefore, 
subjects may use the same jacket during training. Empty cartrid ges will be provided for training 
and practice. Subjects must demonstrate the ability to adequately perform the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_446209].  
 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], a subject cannot adequatel y perform the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_446210] a second training, the subject will be withdrawn from the study. The Site Operations Manual (SOM) provides a more detailed description of the BluHale Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_446211].  
 
Breakfast and AFREZZA dosing: subjects will receive a breakfast that is based on their assigned cohort and their Insulin/Carbohydrate ratio. (See Section 8.1.3 Initial dose for PK 
assessment) The meal will be provided by [CONTACT_977]. At the beginning of the meal, 
immediately before the first m outhful of food, the subject will inhale a dose of AFREZZA. The 
AFREZZA dose will be calculated based on the dosage table (Figure 1 ). The starting and ending 
time of breakfast will be recorded.  
 
Post dosing assessment: the su bject will then remain at the clinical study site for approximately 
6 hours. The following procedures will be performed:  
 
• 4-hour blood PK sample collection for insulin and FDKP. See Table 3 for number of 
samples and Flow Char t 1.2 for sampling  times.  
 
• Subjects will be monitored for signs of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose measurements will 
be taken during the course of the PK assessment visit according to the period Flow 
Chart 1.2, preferably by [CONTACT_446255]’s faci lity 
(e.g., Beckman or YSI). If blood glucose measurement cannot be done in the 
Investigator’s facility, blood samples need to be sent for central laboratory measurement. 
A subject exhibiting signs of hypoglycemia will be treated as appropriate. A snack wi ll 
be given (e.g., 6 oz of milk) if any glucose measured during the PK test is <75 mg/dL.  
 
• Following the [ADDRESS_567468]’s usual lunch. The AFREZZA dose 
should correspond to the subject's usual dose of prandial insulin. Consideration should 
be given to adjusting the lunchtime AFREZZA dose based on plasma glucose  read ings 
during t he PK test and the pre -lunch plasma glucose  value.

• The initial dose of AFREZZA for each meal will be determined based on the subject’s 
usual RAA dose for those meals and the glucose profile during the PK test; the doses 
will be recorded on a subject reminder card that the subject will take with  them.  
 
• The subjects/parents will be instructed to administer AFREZZA at the beginning of  each 
meal and to perform and record (e-Diary) an SMBG assessment at [ADDRESS_567469] the start and ending 
times of each meal and the AFREZZA® dosing  time.  
• Pre-breakfast SMBG values will be obtained (for basal insulin adjustments) and recorded 
for this v isit as well as for the duration of the  study.  
 
• Study site staff will explain to subjects/parents how to titrate the prandial dose for each 
meal based on the [ADDRESS_567470] -dose SMBG  values.  
 
• Study site staff will explain to subjects/parents how to determine the appropriate 
postprandial or follo w-on dose based on the value of [ADDRESS_567471] -dose 
SMBG.  
 
• Instructions will be provided on proper use and storage of AFREZZA® (inhaler and 
cartridges), and subjects/parents will be reminded to bring all cartridges back to the site with them at the ir next  visit.  
 
• Nutritional information will be provided (e.g., including carbohydrate content of meals 
and its impact on insulin requirements). Subjects will receive information about the 
importance of maintaining stable carbohydrate content of meals throughout this  study. 
 
• Glucose meter test strips and Afrezza cartridges will also be provided.  
Discharge  
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic after the completion of PK sampling (4 hours), lunch, 
an abbreviated physical examination and vital signs.  
 
 
12.1.3  Dose titration  period  
AFREZZA® will be taken at the beginning of each meal.  
 
The 28-day dose titration period will consist of 13 visits (Visits 3 to 15), which includes 4 site 
visits (Visit 6, 9, 12, and 15) and 9 telephone contacts (Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14) 
primarily to adjust dosage and assess safety and tolerability.  
 
A follow -up visit (Visit 16) will be performed approximately 1 week after the end of the

The study was a randomized, 2 × [ADDRESS_567483] deviations (SD Total) of 0.250 to 0.750 
for inhaled insulin were used, based on the  SD Total observed for AFREZZA® in adults.  
Table 6  shows the maximum imprecision (in terms of the 95% confidence interval) for 
AFREZZA that will be obtained within an age cohort with 80% assurance, for a total number of 
subjects varying from 6 to 18, and a true SD Total of 0.250, 0.425, 0.450, 0.725, and 0. 750 for 
log(CL/F).

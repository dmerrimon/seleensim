1.[ADDRESS_242724] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_203523] (DMAMR) treatment in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis 
(AIS).  We propose the implementation of Dynamic Myofascial and Articular Mobilization 
and Reorganization (DMAMR) protocol can (a) decrease and/or reduce progression of spi[INVESTIGATOR_203524], (b) reduce degree of anatomical rib hump deformity common in AIS, (c) decrease 
incidence of patients requiring corrective bracing and/or corrective spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691], (d) 
significantly reduce AIS-associated pain, and (e) improve quality of life for AIS patients.
 
Specific Aims
As a preliminary feasibility study, there are specific aims that we will address:
1. Sufficient subjects will be willing to participate in this study 
(Recruitment and Consent).
2. Sufficient subjects in the active treatment group will be willing to 
undergo treatment for the 6 months (Dropout rate will be low 
enough or late enough to avoid undermining statistical analysis).
3. Sufficient subjects in the active treatment group will perform 
independent exercise, use arch supports as necessary, heel lifts, 
ischial lifts, as prescribed (Compliance).
4. Quality of data will be sufficient to provide the basis for the desired 
statistical analysis (Collection and Data Entry).
5) Furthermore, if this research project goes well with regard to the elements 1-[ADDRESS_242725] over 6-month periods of time may produce 
statistically significant changes in the likelihood of requiring bracing or surgery (references 
3,4,5).  The biostatistician has confirmed that we may well have the number of subjects and

strategy, the hypotheses of which are stated below.

lumborum, psoas major and minor, and the abdominal obliques.  The researchers have 
suggested this is a compensatory effect of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203525]1.   We agree that 
unilateral muscle shortening is present in AIS but we suggest that this asymmetry represents 
differences between muscle tension on either side of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203526] a tethering effect 
on the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203527].  Supporting a finding of the importance of these muscle imbalances, 
research using individualized physical therapeutic exercise programs to balance these types of 
muscle imbalances has demonstrated effectiveness in AIS treatment2 [ADDRESS_242727] on the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], represent myofascial dysfunction.  We believe the forces generated by [CONTACT_203585].  The myofascial factors involved in 
the tethering of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203528], primarily iliopsoas, quadratus lumborum, abdominal obliques, 
latissimus dorsi, and anterior serratus muscles.  
Fascia overlies and interpenetrates these muscles.  At a critical point, these myofascial 
imbalances generate sufficient stress on the overlying fascia to create a further contractile 
force within the fascia itself.  We ask whether this contractile force is mediated not only by

We further hypothesize that the asymmetrical muscle imbalances observed in AIS may be part 
of a larger contracted fascial spi[INVESTIGATOR_203529]. Therefore, treatment of the muscles, fascia, and related articular dysfunction may 
contribute to the control or reduction of AIS-associated deformities including scoliotic 
curvatures and accompanying rib humps.  Effective treatment of these imbalances and 
deformities may reduce or eliminate AIS-associated spi[INVESTIGATOR_203530], which we hypothesize is 
largely myofascial in nature.
2. Background
2.1:  Defining the problem and gaps in current knowledge.  
The Scoliosis Research Society has defined scoliosis as a lateral curvature of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203531] 10° as measured using the Cobb method on standing radiograph 7.  Scoliosis is present in 
2-4% of children between 10 and 16 years of age 8.  Curve progression in adulthood is related 
to the degree of curvature at skeletal maturity.  Curves of less than 30° at maturity are unlikely 
to progress.  Curves of 30-50° progress at an average of 10-15° over a lifetime.  Curves 
greater than 50° at maturity progress steadily at a rate of 1° per year 9.  Curve progression in 
adulthood is a key factor in chronic pain and disability. Clinically significant rib cage 
distortion can result in respi[INVESTIGATOR_203532] 10.
In the last [ADDRESS_242728] treatment over many decades has been using bracing to decrease progression of 
the curvature and avoid spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691].  This treatment has been shown to be effective for a 
significant portion of adolescents with scoliosis 13. While there is continuing consensus that

PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
HSC #20-228Page 8 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020scoliosis is a multifactorial disorder, there is little in our understanding of the contributing 
factors that currently inform interventions successful in altering its clinical course.  
Importantly, existing treatments are focused on slowing progression of curvature, because no 
treatments have been shown to actually reverse the condition.    
The one notable recent addition to the therapeutic options is the emerging consensus that 
individualized exercise focusing on addressing muscle imbalances, and thereby [CONTACT_203587][INVESTIGATOR_050], can improve the outcome of scoliosis care and reduce the 
need for corrective surgery 14 15 16 17.  
There is a continuing need to develop a comprehensive program that is both individualized 
and multifactorial.  This research study and the proposed treatment protocol aim to 
demonstrate that – by [CONTACT_14662] a myofascial and articular approach to treatment –   it is 
possible to successfully reduce the rate of progression of scoliosis and/or reduce the degree of 
curvature.  Successful application of this conservative approach has the potential of reducing 
the need for corrective surgery.
    
2.2.:  Relevant Preliminary Data:
It is worthwhile to consider the different biomechanical factors seen in the myofascial 
dysfunction we hypothesize to be mediating AIS.  These factors inform a conservative and 
integrated myofascial approach to treatment. 
Whyte Ferguson developed such a course of individualized multi-factorial treatment over the 
course of 15 years.  This protocol was documented in the treatment of 22 individuals with 
defined or developi[INVESTIGATOR_203534]: The 
Tethered Spi[INVESTIGATOR_203535]: Is Fascial Spi[INVESTIGATOR_203536]? 18.  The treatment approach focused on 
addressing unbalanced fascial tension in the torso, and accompanying myofascial dysfunction 
and related myofascial pain, generally focused on muscles at an angle to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203537].  Articular dysfunction related to these fascial and muscle imbalances 
was also addressed.  Among the significant results of the treatment regimen developed were:
1. Case 1 with a 20° curvature at age 10 , who, after treatment, had an 8° curvature at 
age 11.
2. Case 10 who had a kyphoscoliosis of 63° at age 18 and a thoracolumbar scoliosis with 
a rib hump that was 15° on the first visit and was 8° on the second visit and 4° on the 
third visit, as measured by [CONTACT_203588].  Over several months of care, his 
kyphoscoliosis was also reduced to 50°.
3. Case 9 with a 20° thoracolumbar curvature at age 14 years two months whose rib 
hump decreased in severity but the scoliotic curve increased to 30° while under

PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
HSC #20-228Page 9 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020treatment, but then the treatment approach was changed, and 5 more treatments were 
performed over the next 7 weeks.  At this point, a new set of x-rays was performed at 
the regional orthopedic center and her curvature was reduced to 16° and the bracing 
that had been expected was avoided.
4. Case 2 with an 18° curvature at age 9 and 11° curvature 2-1/2 months later.  After a 
decrease in frequency from care once every 2 weeks to only 6 treatments over the 
next 5 months, the curvature increased to 14°. The patient received only 3 treatments 
in the following 5 months and the curvature increased to 20°. The patient had no 
further care because her family moved out of state, but she reached bone maturity 4 
years later with a curvature of 27°.  She was not prescribed a brace during those four 
years because she had a negligible rib hump.
It is important to note that current understanding of AIS progression is that, once a rib hump 
develops, the anatomic curvature shifts from functional to structural.  In the course of this 
extended case series and with the progression of the practitioner’s advanced skills in 
addressing fascial imbalance, muscular imbalance, and related articular dysfunction, the time 
it took to reduce rib humps became shorter, and there was an increase in the degree of 
reduction of the rib humps.  In the case series referred to above, 17 cases had significant rib 
humps at the beginning of their care and of these, 10 had reduction of their rib humps to the 
point that Adam’s Forward Bend Test was negative for rib hump or the remaining rib hump 
was minimal.  It is important to note that these improvements maintained over time.  Because 
the DMAMR protocol was so successful, we must conclude that there is a considerable degree 
of plasticity of the rib cage in adolescents.
While promising, the above results are from case study data only.  Only by [CONTACT_203589], can we assess the significance of the case study findings described above.  There 
is a critical need for powerful conservative treatment approaches to address AIS and reduce 
the need for surgery.  The DMAMR treatment protocol to be evaluated in this proposed 
research project may hold promise to achieve this goal.  It is also hoped that this research 
project will demonstrate improvement in pain levels and quality of life.
2.3.: Significance of research based on existing literature; how the proposed research will 
add to existing knowledge:
In addition to the literature review that was part of the article published by [CONTACT_203590], there have been important additions to our understanding of AIS that add to 
the importance of the proposed research.  These findings address the four biomechanical 
factors discussed below and further corroborate the need for a successful multifactorial and 
individualized treatment protocol: 
1.Muscle Imbalances
To date, research on muscle imbalances has focused on the paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_203539].  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
HSC #20-228Page 10 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020Further, what differences were found could as easily be explained as the result of the 
curvature rather than contributing to its causation 19.  
Importantly, recent genetic studies have provided evidence that skeletal muscle 
dysfunction could be a contributory factor in AIS susceptibility: rare variants in 
fibrillin-[ADDRESS_242730] been found to be associated with severe AIS.  These 
glycoproteins form key components of skeletal muscle myofibrillar structure and 
abnormality of fibrillin-1 is associated with the connective tissue disorder, Marfan’s. 
Importantly, 60% of patients with Marfan’s develop scoliosis 20.  Recent research 
reported signs of muscle myopathy and muscular atrophy on both the convex and 
concave sides of the scoliosis apex 21.  These findings accentuate the fact that muscle 
and associated soft tissue abnormalities are the norm in severe AIS, but these 
abnormalities still do not explain the dynamics of the development of the AIS.  
In the AIS treatment protocol used in the case series cited above, the treatment of 
muscle imbalances was most effective when it focused on muscles at an angle to the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Research is beginning to address the importance of several of these muscles.  
Increased curvature in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_203540] 
12th rib on the ipsilateral side and there is no such correlation in normal controls.  It is 
suggested by [CONTACT_203591], due to the fact 
that the Quadratus lumborum is the largest of the muscles that attach to the ribs, as 
well as to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203541] 22.  When researchers used Botulinum toxin A to 
temporarily paralyze the Psoas major in 9 adolescent subjects, radiographs taken 6 
weeks later showed a significant decrease in both the lumbar and the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_203542]’s angles, with a non-significant decrease in both lumbar and thoracic derotation 
23.  
In the research proposed here, treatment will be focused on elongating muscles that 
are palpably shortened, including the Iliopsoas and the Quadratus lumborum.  It is 
important to note that the potential importance of the Iliopsoas does include the fact

HSC #20-228Page 12 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020Similarly, the Quadratus lumborum does attach to the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_203546], but Whyte Ferguson found, in the case series study referenced above, that 
different portions of the Quadratus lumborum were shortened on the convex and 
concave sides of the lumbar curvature.  The iliolumbar portion of the Quadratus 
lumborum was shorter on the side of convexity of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (in 19 out of 20 
cases) thus potentially pulling the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_203547].  The iliocostal 
portion of the Quadratus was shorter on the side of 
concavity of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (in 19 out of 20 cases) 
thus potentially pulling the ilium and the rib cage 
closer to each other and contributing to the concavity 
of the lumbar curvature. (Figure 2)  Pelvic obliquity 
may be a factor that disposes the iliolumbar portion 
of the Quadratus lumborum to shorten on the side that

Whyte Ferguson also noted that the latissimus dorsi and anterior serratus were 
shortened in the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_203549], on the side of the rib hump and appeared 
likely to contribute to the forces bending and deforming the ribs.  (Figure 3 and 4)

Manual.  In: Upper Half of Body.  Second ed., Vol.1. Lippi[INVESTIGATOR_10354], Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore.
The AIS treatment protocol in the proposed research project will include using 
myofascial release techniques to address muscle asymmetries and balance muscle 
tensions around the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203550], focusing especially on the muscles that are at an 
angle to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Exercises including stretching will also be prescribed to release 
muscles that are tighter on one side of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203551], and to strengthen 
muscles that are weaker on one side of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203551].
2.  Pelvic Obliquity
Whyte Ferguson’s AIS treatment protocol also focuses on balancing the pelvis to 
reduce pelvic obliquity and address leg length inequality, and unbalanced height of the 
ilia when seated.  Research has corroborated the association of sacral slanting with 
pelvic obliquity and lumbar curvature in AIS and there is also some correlation 
between leg length difference and sacral slanting 24.  Pelvic rotation has been found to 
correlate with rotational status of both the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_203552] 25.  
Most of the literature supposes that the pelvic imbalances are a compensation for the 
curvatures of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  But it could easily be the case that the sacrum provides the 
base that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203553], or is rotated posterior 
to the plane of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203554], the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_203555].  In the proposed research, 
the unbalanced hip height while standing may be addressed with a heel lift for the 
patient to wear in footwear.  The unbalanced hip height while seated will be addressed 
with an ischial lift, an approximately 3/8” thick magazine, for the subject to sit upon 
whenever seated for extended periods of time.  Heel lifts and ischial lifts will be 
provided to the subjects in this study as appropriate.  The pelvic obliquity will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_203593].  
Since addressing the pelvic obliquity and unbalanced hip height were found to be very 
important in the treatment protocol of the case series cited above, we may be able to 
learn whether the imbalances of the pelvis are compensatory to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203550], 
or whether rather the imbalance of the pelvis may be a factor contributing to 
progression of AIS.

HSC #20-228Page 15 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020Whyte Ferguson’s observation about the importance of ligamentous laxity in the 
development of AIS has been confirmed by [CONTACT_29091] [ADDRESS_242732] significant arches in their 
feet that fully collapse when they are weight bearing.  Exercises were not found to be 
effective to counter the over-pronation, and the degree of over-pronation often differed 
from one foot to the other so arch supports were prescribed to address the over-
pronation.  
Imbalances in pronation can be related to pelvic obliquity30.  Control of over-pronation 
may be one factor of import in treating AIS.  This is one of the factors to be addressed 
in the proposed research and arch supports will be provided to each of the subjects in 
the active treatment group.
 
4.Fascial Imbalance                   
In a recent literature search, there was no citation to any article that discussed the 
importance of fascia in treatment of scoliosis with the exception of the case series by 
[CONTACT_203594].  This is not surprising considering that it is only recently 
that fascia has been 
identified as a separate organ 
and viewed as a tissue of 
import.  Treatment strategies 
to address dysfunction of the 
fascia are an emerging field.

utilizing a variety of assessment and treatment techniques to address contractions of 
fascia, most importantly spi[INVESTIGATOR_203558], to successfully treat adolescents with AIS.  
Directly addressing the myofascial components of AIS is an  entirely new area of focus 
with regard to treatment of AIS.  The DMAMR protocol in the proposed study 
incorporates fascial release techniques and the subjects will perform exercises that are 
also designed to release abnormal fascial constriction. 
The treatment regimen for AIS that will be employed in the proposed research project 
is a multifactorial approach 
based on addressing 
biomechanical factors [ADDRESS_242734] the development and progression of AIS.  If 
successful, the rate of bracing and surgery will be significantly reduced, with reduction 
of pain and improvement of quality of life.  
3.  STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description
A cohort of 28 children and adolescents with scoliosis will receive a treatment protocol 
including myofascial and articular treatment; home exercises; arch supports, heel lifts and 
ischial lifts; and bracing as indicated.  Treatments will be conducted twice per month for [ADDRESS_242735] physical therapy, and bracing as indicated.  Outcome measures for the 
two groups will include data from x-rays taken in the usual course of scoliosis care (every 6 
months) at Carrie Tingley Radiology Department at the beginning, and after 6 months of care.  
The radiologists who will be measuring the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203559].  Rib humps will 
be measured by [CONTACT_203595], at the beginning, and after 6 months of care.  The SRS 22 
Questionnaire, as a measure of Quality of Life, will be administered by a blinded individual at 
the beginning, and after 6 months of care.  At these same times, subjects will fill out a Pain 
Scale, also administered by a blinded individual.  (X-rays taken every [ADDRESS_242736] care for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  The other measurements are 
specific to this study.)

HSC #20-228Page 17 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020Potential participants will be drawn from the cohort of current patients at Carrie Tingley 
Orthopaedic Clinic and will be initially identified and screened by [CONTACT_203596]-up visits.  Screening criteria for participation includes: (1) age 10-15 years, (2) 
curvatures ranging from 15 degrees to 30 degrees, and (3) bone growth has not yet completed.  
Participants may be either female or male.  The control and active treatment groups are 
expected to include participants who are and others who are not wearing spi[INVESTIGATOR_203561] a 
part of their care.  English and Spanish speaking subjects will be eligible for participation.  
Foster children/wards of the state will not be enrolled in the study.  Pregnant individuals will 
not be enrolled in the study.
Principal Investigator, Selina Silva and her medical colleagues will perform the screening for 
eligibility.  They will have access to potential subjects’ medical records and will screen for the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
4.2  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Criteria that will define who will be included in the final study sample include age 10-15 
years, curvature from 15 to 30 degrees, and the following: (1) Degree of bone growth.  Only 
patients who have not yet completed bone growth as evidenced by [CONTACT_203597]31 will be 
included in the study.  (2) Subjects must be willing and available to participate in regular 
twice-monthly (free) treatments for [ADDRESS_242737] in Albuquerque or 
in Taos.  Participants’ parents or guardians are responsible for providing transportation.  (If 
subjects miss treatments for whatever reason, their data will still be analyzed with the 
understanding that they did not complete the full treatment protocol.)  Preference will be for 
enrollment of patients exhibiting either double major S-scoliosis or thoraco-lumbar scoliosis.  
Controls will be matched to the degree possible for age and degree of curvature.  [CONTACT_203617] is 
unblinded and she will assure that the numbers of braced subjects is balanced between the 
active treatment and control groups by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_203562].  Patients enrolled in the study who have a curvature that falls within 
criteria for bracing at the time of enrollment or during the study will receive bracing plus 
protocol care. Bracing is a stratification variable for statistical analysis.  The proportion of 
unbraced subjects at the beginning of the study who require bracing at the end of the six 
month study period will also be used for outcome analysis and comparison between the active 
treatment and control groups. The criteria for surgery are [ADDRESS_242738] 20-25 degree 
curvatures at the beginning of the study will be braced, and there will not be repeat x-rays 
until the end of the 6 month study.  Therefore the study structure and selection process 
precludes the existence of study subjects who will require surgery during the time of the 
research.  (3) We must have access to data about spi[INVESTIGATOR_203563] x-rays performed at 
the beginning of the study and after 6 months (the standard timing for x-rays of children and 
adults with scoliosis).  Pregnant subjects will thus be excluded and this screening will be 
conducted according to standard procedures at the Radiation Department at Carrie Tingley 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. (4)  Those subjects in the control group will have access to any 
treatments that are usual and customary for scoliosis, other than the specific treatment

excluded from the study.

known disease process that causes the scoliosis, then this person’s curvature does not qualify 
as AIS.  Such medical conditions include: Marfan’s, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Congenital 
scoliosis, Neuromuscular scoliosis, Scheurmanns kyphosis, Spondylolisthesis, and 
Spondylolysis and possibly other conditions that may contribute to scoliosis such as Cerebral 
Palsy, and Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. 
Measures will be taken to translate for any children or teenagers who are Spanish speakers. 
Spanish versions of consent forms, for example, can be provided, and [CONTACT_203618] is 
fluent in Spanish.  (Once the English versions of Recruitment brochures, Consent, and Assent 
Forms are approved, we will proceed to complete Spanish versions of these documents.)  
We will also be excluding children that fall outside of the age range 10-[ADDRESS_242741] at Carrie Tingley Orthopaedic 
Center.  We will also use the x-ray data from x-rays taken at Carrie Tingley which will be part 
of screening for criteria of inclusion/exclusion.  But the intervention will take place in 
separate buildings for the following reasons:  We  will treat children and adolescents at  the

Additional Staff Resources
[CONTACT_203617] will use a medical colleague to assist in recruitment of subjects, and blinded nurse 
practitioners to measure rib humps and administer Pain and Quality of Life Questionnaires.  
Data regarding degree of curvature for this study will be drawn from the x-rays that are 
normally taken every [ADDRESS_242751]. Selina Silva and colleagues see 15 to 20 children and adolescents with scoliosis per week.  
Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, it is likely that they will be able to recruit the

scoliosis, it is likely that 56 suitable subjects can be recruited.  
With 2 months for recruitment, 6 months for active treatment, 1 month devoted to 
measurements and questionnaires, and 2 months for statistical analysis, we should be able to 
complete the research within 1 year.

HSC #20-228Page 25 of 50Version Date: 10/14/[ZIP_CODE]) Midlevel Provider will measure rib humps and will administer SRS22 Quality of Life 
Questionnaire and Pain Scale to control group and active treatment group at beginning 
of study.  The rib hump measurements will assess one aspect of the deformity that 
results from scoliosis.   The questionnaires have been applied in other research on 
scoliosis and are recommended as components of high quality research by [CONTACT_203603]-
SOSORT research recommendations.
3) Active treatment group will be examined with regard to joint and myofascial 
dysfunctions, muscle strength and weakness, and joint dysfunction and ligamentous 
laxity will be assessed with Beighton scale.  Participants will also be assessed with 
regard to over-pronation, and whether the pelvis is balanced while seated and standing.  
These (free) assessments will determine the design of treatment interventions.  
4) Active treatment subjects will then receive (free) treatment twice per week for 6 
months, including joint manipulation to thoracic and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_203571], and 
mobilization of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_203572].  Heel or ischial lifts and/or arch supports will be 
provided as indicated.  Home exercises will be prescribed with exercise equipment 
provided for free.  A small ball for rib mobilization will be provided to each 
participant.  A doorway stretching (or chin-up) bar will be provided that fits securely 
over the door frame and requires no installation.  Some homes, particularly adobe 
homes, do not have door frames, so stretching or chin-up bars will be provided that 
can be installed.  Subjects will keep a log of compliance with exercises and use of heel 
and/or ischial lifts.  The logs of compliance will be used to help interpret research 
results.   
5) 6 months after the initial assessments, both the active treatment group and the control 
group will be re-evaluated with x-rays (again provided as part of standard care at 
Carrie Tingley Radiology), rib hump measurement, and SRS22 and Pain Scale and this 
completes collection of data for assessment of the results of the intervention.
6) Control group participants will be free to pursue standard physical therapy if they so 
desire.      
7) Research results will be analyzed and written up and information will be shared with 
participants.  Analysis will be completed with the goal of writing an article for 
publication.
8) SRS22 (Quality of Life) and Pain Scale documents and logs of exercise compliance 
will be submitted as separate attachments.
9) The exercise equipment includes: over the door hanging bar and ball.  Heel lifts and 
ischial lifts, arch supports are also provided as part of treatment protocol.  
Treatment tools used by [CONTACT_203604]: the activator adjusting instrument 
and a standard triangular reflex hammer, as well as hydrocollator packs. 
All of this equipment and these devices are being used in this research project but are 
not being studied for safety and effectiveness.  This equipment and these devices are 
already used in standard chiropractic care and physical therapy.

13.1  Data Analysis Plan, Statistical Procedures
Our primary study outcomes are change in Cobb angles and rib hump angles. Schrieber et al. 
(2016) found that changes in Cobb angles were associated with patient height and weight in 
addition to treatment. Therefore, we will use a linear mixed model approach to account for 
repeated measures and adjust for height and weight. In these analyses the time x treatment 
interaction tests whether pre/post change is different for the two study arms. Pain and quality 
of life measures will be analyzed using a similar approach. We will examine distributions of 
outcome variables to determine if transformations are needed to improve adherence to 
analysis assumptions. Fisher exact tests will be used to assess whether frequency of corrective 
bracing or spi[INVESTIGATOR_203573]. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_203574] (0.05) for multiple comparisons. Summary means, standard deviations,

without their consent.  If participants receiving the active intervention do not perform their 
exercises or do not use heel lifts and arch supports, records of compliance will be kept and 
used in the interpretation and assessment of feasibility.  (It is [CONTACT_203618]’s 
experience that she can often tell if subjects have slacked off on their performance of 
exercises, and identifying this and providing encouragement are part of the active 
intervention.) Subjects will not be dropped from the study for failure to perform exercises.   If 
subjects selected for the active intervention do not come to treatment visits, attempts will be 
made to make up the missed sessions.  If subjects drop out early in the process, their consent 
is implied by [CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_41248], and it may be feasible to continue the enrollment process and fill 
out the active treatment group.  Participants may withdraw from the study at any time, and 
may notify either [CONTACT_203617] or [CONTACT_203618] of their desire to do so, or their withdrawal 
may be inferred from their lack of attendance.  Participants who drop out early may be 
replaced if it is feasible to do so.  Data on those participants who are not replaced will be 
retained and analyzed with the decreased treatment considered in the analysis (unless the 
subject directs that their data be removed from the study) and this is part of the assessment of 
feasibility.  It will be made clear to participants that they will lose none of their eligibility for 
standard care through Carrie Tingley Orthopedic Clinic as a result of their withdrawal.  The 
number of subjects enrolled in the study has included the expectation of some attrition, with 
the likelihood that it will still be possible to analyze the statistical significance of the results.  
Again, this is part of the assessment of feasibility.
15.2  Orderly termination / Safe withdrawal
N/A. Not required; subjects can terminate chiropractic care with no safety repercussions.
15.3  Partial Withdrawal

their data will be interpreted with this taken into consideration.  If they choose to drop out of 
the study, this is allowed, and the data already collected will be used.

15.5  Withdrawal Procedures and Limitations
Subjects are requested to notify investigator or coordinator if they wish to withdraw from the 
study.  All subjects are free to withdraw at any time, without limitations.    
16.  DATA MANAGEMENT/CONFIDENTIALITY
Data forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office. 
Project data will be coded into the HIPPA-compliant installation of REDCap maintained by 
[CONTACT_203607]. A limited analytic file will be used for data analyses conducted on UNM 
computers.  Research records and data collected will be retained until research subjects reach 
22 years of age.
16.1-16.4  Data Sharing
N/A  No data sharing
16.[ADDRESS_242763]’s chart indicating that they are subjects in this 
research study.  Any individual rendering medical or other care to these research subjects will 
thus have access to this information simply by [CONTACT_203608].
The blinded nurse practitioners will access the data on the patients x-rays and will have the 
information about rib hump measurements and the results of both questionnaires and they or a 
Resident will input this data into the REDCap system.  After this, the raw data and any 
records of medical visits of treatment of active treatment subjects during the treatment period 
will be kept in a locked file in [CONTACT_203617]’s office and only the unblinded medical practioners 
will have access to this part of the medical record.  [CONTACT_203618] will not have access 
to these data but will have access to beginning x-ray images of study subjects in order to plan 
interventions. 
Records of Off-Site Treatment
What will take place at the  UNM  CTSC clinical rooms in Albuquerque and [CONTACT_203619]’s Taos/El Prado office is the examination and treatment of the active treatment 
subjects.  Records of the examination and treatment sessions will be maintained but coded and 
kept in the secure electronic record that [CONTACT_203618] uses to keep records of all of her 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
HSC #20-228Page 30 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020patients.  She will need to have continuing access to this information so that she can refer 
back to prior visits when making clinical decisions about current and ongoing treatment. 
Treatment records would ordinarily be entered into the patient’s regular UNM record, but this 
obviously cannot be done during the study because it would reveal who is and who is not in 
the active treatment group versus the control group, and would thus potentially destroy the 
blinding.  These records are not the measures that will be used in the monitoring and statistical 
analysis of treatment results between active and control groups.  They are not the Data for this 
study, so they will not be deposited in the REDCap system. As soon as the study is complete, 
[CONTACT_203618] will electronically enter the treatment notes into the Clinical Notes 
section of each active subject’s UNM medical record.  [CONTACT_203618] uses this same 
procedure to complete her UNM Pain Center treatment notes remotely on her computer and 
transfer these notes to the patient’s UNM electronic patient record.

16.7    Access, use, or disclosure of PHI
PHI will only be used during the screening process.  Therefore, we are requesting a waiver of 
HIPAA authorization: Adequate written assurances that the protected health information will 
not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for

16.11   Steps taken to secure data
After data is initially collected (measurements, questionnaires) it will be kept in a locked file

17.  DATA AND SPECIMEN BANKING
17.1  Repository for Data, Specimens
The data regarding x-rays of the subjects in both the active treatment group and the control 
group will be stored in the regular secured patient files at Carrie Tingley Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
as part of their files in the University of New Mexico medical system.  The data regarding rib 
humps, and responses to Pain and Quality of Life Questionnaires will be entered into the 
REDCap repository system.  The data will be encoded and will be aggregated for statistical 
analysis. The data uploaded into REDCap will be de-identified.  The data will not be stored 
for any future unspecified research.
17.2  Banking of data in multi-center study
N/A because this is not a multi-center study.  All of the data for monitoring the status of each 
subject in the active treatment and control group will be collected at Carrie Tingley Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  This data will be retained and analyzed using the REDCap system.  The data will be 
retained in the REDCap system for time sufficient to respond to any queries around securing 
publication of article or articles in journals.  The data will not be retained or banked for 
unspecified further research.  The data will be retained until the subjects reach age 22.  Then 
the data will be transferred to the patient’s secure UNM medical record or destroyed.  The 
examination and treatment notes of the active treatment subjects who are treated in Taos/El 
Prado, New Mexico, at [CONTACT_203618]’s private office, or at CTSC clinical rooms in 
Albuquerque will be coded and stored securely in [CONTACT_203618]’s computer and 
electronic health records and these records will be transferred back to the subjects’ secure 
UNM medical files.  
18.  RISKS TO SUBJECTS
18.1  Reasonably foreseeable risks
Safety of Chiropractic Care
Safety data on risks of pediatric chiropractic care relate principally to missed diagnoses.  
Because these subjects will be co-managed with medical staff at Carrie Tingley throughout, 
the risk of a missed diagnosis is minimal.  Other risks from pediatric chiropractic care are 
generally minimal and generally include a low level of soreness that persists for only 24 to 48 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
HSC #20-228Page 33 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020hours32 [ADDRESS_242769] without the participation or knowledge of the blinded nurse practitioners.   The 
measurements and questionnaires (after the data is entered in REDCap) and any data about 
medical care required during the active treatment of study subjects will be stored in a locked 
file in [CONTACT_203617]’s office, so these records will not be accessible to the blinded nurse 
practitioners.  The data uploaded into REDCap will be de-identified.  The Co-Investigator 
who will be performing the treatment of the active treatment subjects, has treated children and 
adolescents throughout her 37-year chiropractic career without any significant complications 
other than muscle soreness that may last from 24 to 48 hours.  She was even able to help treat 
the pain of a child with scoliosis due to osteogenesis imperfecta without any complications, 
and she significantly helped this child with pain reduction.  Note that the Co- Investigator’s 
credentialing through the UNM Department of Neurosurgery does not allow her to perform 
cervical manipulation (as opposed to mobilization) so any risks that might be attendant to 
such procedures will not be applicable to the treatment of subjects in this research study.  
Hydrocollator therapy will be applied to warm the muscles and make it easier to perform soft 
tissue release procedures.  Plenty of towels will be placed between subjects and the 
hydrocollator packs, and a call bell will be provided to subjects during hydrocollator 
application.  The Co-Investigator or another staff member will be within earshot of any 
subject who is receiving hydrocollator therapy.  Hydrocollator therapy has been used as a 
regular part of [CONTACT_203618]’s care of patients for the past [ADDRESS_242770] occurred from hydrocollator therapy.

HSC #20-228Page 34 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020The extremely unlikely events of a child suffering a rib fracture or a herniated disc are listed 
as reasons for terminating the research study.  These events have rarely if ever been reported 
in children (although they have been reported in adults) and would generally indicate a pre-
existing condition such as low bone density.  If either of these events were to occur, this 
would indicate faulty screening or inappropriate forcefulness of treatment procedures.    
Risk of Loss of Privacy
Note that almost all research includes confidentiality risks.  Since the data will be stored in the 
patients’ UNM files and will be coded and stored in the REDCap system, confidentiality risks 
are no more than any patient with a UNM file faces.  The treatment records of the intervention 
sessions will be stored in a similarly secure site until the completion of the study when they 
also will be transferred and stored in the patients’ UNM files.  These are the measures which 
will be taken to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality.   It will help to have the data 
uploaded into REDCap to be de-identified.
Risks Related to Use of Heel Lifts, Arch Supports, Ischial Lifts, Small Balls, Stretching 
(chin-up) Bar
[CONTACT_203618] is not aware of any injury suffered from the use of heel lifts, arch 
supports, ischial lifts, or small balls or stretching bars and these measures have been a 
standard part of her care of patients for at least [ADDRESS_242773] been part of the usual and 
customary treatment procedures in chiropractic (and physical therapy) practices for many 
decades.  The only exception is the fascial release procedures, and these are soft tissue release 
procedures that have been developed over the last [ADDRESS_242774] circumstances, except for possible muscle 
soreness for 24 to 48 hours.  
18.3  Risk to embryo or fetus
The only procedure linked to this study (but not performed under the study) that would place a 
fetus at risk would be an x-ray.  According to Carrie Tingley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203578], X-rays will not be performed on any adolescent who has 
become pregnant.  This study is not performing the x-rays but is simply drawing the data from 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
HSC #20-228Page 35 of 50Version Date: 10/14/2020the X-rays that are part of the usual care of scoliosis patients, every 6 months, and the medical 
necessity has been considered to outweigh the risks of that exposure to ionizing radiation.

20.[ADDRESS_242776] in a private office during private communication between the doctor and the potential 
subjects and their parents/guardians.  In both recruitment materials and consent materials, it 
will be made very clear that anyone who decides not to participate will not forfeit any future 
usual clinical services through Carrie Tingley Orthopedic Clinic.  This should mitigate against 
undue influence during recruitment by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical care provider.  It should be 
remembered that [CONTACT_203618] has an investment in establishing the usefulness of 
myofascial and articular care of AIS, but [CONTACT_203617] and her colleagues have no investment in 
the outcome.  For this reason, the recruitment, consent, and data collection and input into the 
REDCap system,( as well as data analysis) is appropriately shielded from any contact [CONTACT_203610]. Whyte Ferguson.

yet complete, and x-rays showing Cobb angle of 15 to 30 degrees), and exclusion criteria 
(excluding curvatures that involve other diseases or conditions and are not strictly AIS).  
Children and adolescents with AIS are monitored every 6 months to decide what treatments 
they may require.  The information that doctors will already be considering in this monitoring 
function include these same factors: age, size of curvature, and the type of curvature.  The 
process of identifying subjects is simply an extension of their normal monitoring process.  
20.[ADDRESS_242778] subjects’ privacy interests:

data collection sessions will take a little more time than the usual every [ADDRESS_242779]. Whyte Ferguson’s 
private chiropractic office twice per month for 6 months, and the records of these visits will be 
kept confidential.  The subjects’ access to these office sites will be no different from the 
access of any member of the public to these sites.  There is therefore no specific privacy risk 
associated with their coming and going from the treatment sites.

While performing partial hanging from a bar in a doorway, subjects will need to have their 
feet on the floor.  If they are too short, parents will need to provide a suitable safe surface on 
the floor in the doorway, so that the partial hanging can be safely performed.  It is not 
expected that this requirement, to provide a safe surface, will pose a financial burden.

Reasonable compensation or reimbursement for subjects: Control group: $50 for control 
subjects to complete both the initial and 6 month evaluations: total compensation of 
$50/subject.  Compensation will be made in the form of merchandise cards.  Travel will not 
be reimbursed because these visits would have been expected anyway.
Active treatment group:  $100 for completing each 3 months of treatments including the initial 
and final (6 month) evaluations:  Total $200/subject.  These compensations will be paid in 
merchandise cards.  Travel reimbursement at the rate of $.20 per mile will apply to travel to

visit for discussion of x-ray results, then a separate visit would be required to administer the 
other baseline questionnaires and the rib deformity measurement.
25.1.5  Processes to ensure ongoing consent throughout the study
It will be made clear to the participants that they can withdraw from the study at any time.  
Any concerns among those participating in the active treatment will be discussed and 
hopefully dealt with so that the subjects can successfully continue.  It should be noted that

31.  RESEARCH  INVOLVING AMERICAN INDIAN/NATIVE POPULATIONS 
31.1  Sensitivity to American Indian/Native Populations
While Native populations are not specifically a target for this study, they are eligible for 
enrollment and may become study participants.  The proposed research is both acceptable and 
sensitive to local Native community attitudes as evidenced by [CONTACT_203616]-investigator which included this population (Whyte 
Ferguson L, 2017).  Co-investigator’s experience identified that the manual treatment 
modalities being studied, then and now, are highly compatible with tribal attitudes which can 
tend to prefer manual treatment over more invasive interventions.  (Note that the co-
investigator and designer of the AIS treatment intervention donated her time to provide care to 
Taos Pueblo members at the Pueblo 1-2 days per month, for 22 years.)

33.  DRUGS OR DEVICES
33.1-33.4: N/A
Research involves no drugs or medical devices.  Treatment tools that may be used during an 
exam as part of the active protocol include (1) activator adjusting instrument (a low amplitude 
impulse device designed to facilitate spi[INVESTIGATOR_203579]), (2) standard reflex hammer, (3) 
hydrocollators (moist heat packs).  Treatment tools will be utilized, cleaned and handled in 
accordance with standard hygiene practices.  Home tools that will be distributed to 
participants to use as part of the home exercise program include (1) small therapy ball (used in 
the supi[INVESTIGATOR_203580] a fulcrum enhancing extension at the rib-spi[INVESTIGATOR_203581]), (2) 
standard over-the-doorway chin-up bar to perform over-the-door stabilized stretching (feet on 
the ground).  When appropriate, additional home devices may include heel lifts and arch 
supports, as well as ischial lifts, to balance the effects of any structural asymmetries and over-
pronation. 
These devices and tools are not the subjects of the research protocol but are commonly used 
tools within the chiropractic profession.

HSC #20-228Page 43 of 50Version Date: 10/14/[ADDRESS_242795] 
Practices, including:
1.Best Practice for data collection is for it to be directly entered onto a data collection 
form that is in a secured access folder on an HS drive behind a firewall, or in a secure 
UNM Data Security approved system such as RedCap.
2. Data collection of de-identified data, if done in a clinical setting or other setting that 
does not allow direct entry into a secured system, may be done temporarily using a 
personal or university owned electronic storage device or hard copy document. The 
important security safeguard is that no identifiers be include if the data is entered 
or stored using an untrusted device or storage.
3.Permanent (during data analysis, after study closure) storage must reside on HSC 
central IT managed storage. Processing of data (aggregation, etc.) are to be carried out 
in such a way as to avoid creating/retaining files on untrusted storage 
devices/computers. Trusted devices are HSC managed and provide one or more of 
following safeguards: access logs, encryption keys, backups, business continuity and 
disaster recovery capabilities.
4.Alternate storage media must be approve by [CONTACT_123899].

This section contains checklists to provide information on a variety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_86661].  Please complete all checklists relevant to your research.
2. Partial Waiver of Consent for Screening/Recruitment
Complete this checklist if you are requesting a partial waiver of consent so that you can review 
private information to identify potential subjects and/or determine eligibility prior to 
approaching potential subjects for consent or parental permission.
A. Describe the data source that you need to review (e.g., medical records):
Medical records will be consulted to identify potential subjects.     
B. Describe the purpose for the review (e.g., screening):
Medical records will be consulted for screening purposes.      
C. Describe who will conducting the reviews (e.g., investigators, research staff):
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_203582].     
D. Do all persons who will be conducting the reviews already have permitted access to the 
data source?
      X Yes
             No. Explain:      
i.Verify that each of the following are true or provide an alternate 
justification for the underlined regulatory criteria:
1.The activity involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects 
because the records review itself is non-invasive and the results of the 
records review will not be used for any purposes other than those 
described above.
X True
 Other justification:      
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects because eligible subjects will be approached for 
consent to participate in the research and are free to decline.  Further, 
the information accessed during the records review will not be 
disclosed to anyone without a legitimate purpose (e.g., verification of 
eligibility).
X True
 Other justification:      
PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Aolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
Page 46 of 50Version Date:10/14/[ZIP_CODE]. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or 
alteration because there is no other reasonably efficient and effective 
way to identify who to approach for possible participation in the 
research.  
X True
 Other justification:      
4. Whenever appropriate, potentially eligible subjects will be presented 
with information about the research and asked to consider 
participation.  (Regulatory criteria: Whenever appropriate, the 
subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation.)
X True
 Other justification:      
3. Partial Waiver of HIPAA Authorization for Screening/Recruitment
Complete the following additional questions/attestations if the records you will review to identify 
potential subjects and/or determine eligibility include Protected Health Information (PHI).
A. Will you be recording any PHI when conducting the records review to identify potential 
subjects and/or determine eligibility?
            X Yes. Describe: The PHI will be accessed, including age, degree of curvature, and type 
of scoliosis, and then the subject will be assigned a code if the potential subject becomes an 
actual subject.  The PHI of anyone who does not become a subject will be discarded or otherwise 
not retained.
             No
B. If you answered “Yes” to question 6 above, please describe when you will destroy 
identifiers (must be the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research) 
or provide justification for why they must be retained:
The coding and its correlation to the PHI will be retained only long enough for conduct of 
the research and statistical analysis and then the data will be used in aggregate form 
thereafter.  The coding key will be destroyed at that time unless the coding key will be 
necessary for preserving data until subjects reach age 22.     
C. The PHI accessed or recorded for identification/screening purposes will not be reused or 
disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for 
authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or 
disclosure of the PHI would be permitted under the Privacy Rule.
      X True
             False

Page 47 of 50Version Date:10/14/202044.  VULNERABLE POPULATIONS
A.  Children
Complete this checklist if the subject population will include children.
1. Select the category of research that you believe this research falls within and 
provide justification for any associated criteria.  If there are different 
assessments for different groups of children or arms (e.g., placebo vs. drug), 
include a memo to provide an assessment for each group.  
 Research not involving greater than minimal risk. (Minimal risk means 
that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated 
in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those 
ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of 
routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.)
 Research involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the 
prospect of direct benefit to the individual subjects.
Provide justification for each of the following criteria:
(1) The risk is justified by [CONTACT_32117]: 
because of the modest nature of the risk: self limited muscle 
soreness that may last 24 to 48 hours, any benefit that they may 
gain from the treatment regimen such as reduced pain, 
reduction of the size of the rib cage elevation or deformity, 
and/or reduction in the actual degrees of the curvature or 
reduction in the rate of increase of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_203583]. 
      
(2) The relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as 
favorable to the subjects as that presented by [CONTACT_32118]: There can also be modest muscle 
soreness or skin breakdown associated with the use of spi[INVESTIGATOR_203584], thus the 
intervention is comparable to other available treatment 
approaches.
 Research involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct 
benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable 
knowledge about the subject's disorder or condition.
Provide justification for each of the following criteria:
(1) The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk:
     
PROTOCOL TITLE: Myofascial and Articular Treatment of Aolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis
Page 48 of 50Version Date:10/14/2020(2) The intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects 
that are reasonably comensurate with those inherent in their 
actual or expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or 
educational situations:
Yes
(3) The intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable 
knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition which is of 
vital importance for the understanding or amelioration of the 
subjects' disorder or condition
Yes

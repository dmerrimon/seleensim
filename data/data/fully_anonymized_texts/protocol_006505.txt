Fasudil Study Protocol  
 
 Using a double -blind, placebo -controlled, crossover design, subjects were randomized to 
receive an infusion of either saline (placebo control) or fasudil for their first experimental visit.  
Subjects then received the opposite treatment for their second experimental visit, with at least 
five days and no more than two months between the first and seco nd visit.  All experimental 
measures were performed in the same order for each visit within a subject, with the order of 
hypoxia and graded -intensity rhythmic handgrip exercise trials randomized and counterbalanced 
between subjects.  Arterial stiffness mea sures (augmentation index and carotid -femoral pulse 
wave velocity) were performed before and after placement of the venous catheter and 60 min 
treatment administration.  For both the hypoxia and exercise trials, resting hemodynamics were 
measured for 2 -3 min until a steady -state was observed, after which the physiological stimulus 
was initiated.  The hypoxia trial consisted of 3 min of steady -state hypoxia at an oxygen 
saturation of ~80% as assessed via pulse oximetry on the earlobe (SpO2; plus ~2 min for t he 
normoxia to hypoxia transition).  The exercise trial consisted of 4 min at each workload to 
ensure that steady -state hemodynamics were achieved.  Blood samples for plasma [ATP] were 
taken under steady -state conditions at rest, the end of hypoxia, and th e end of each exercise 
workload.

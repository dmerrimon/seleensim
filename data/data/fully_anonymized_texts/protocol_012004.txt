1.0 Objectives  
Primary objectives:  
a. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of transplantation in which one unit of 
cord blood is expanded in mesynchymal precursor cell (MPC) co -cultures  and 
the other unit of cord blood is fucosylated with fucosyltransferase (FT) -VI and 
guanosine diphosphate (GDP) fucose prior to infusion in patients with 
hematologic malignancies following high -dose  therapy  
b. To evaluate  the time to engraftment  using  one expanded   and one 
fucosylated cord  blood  
 
Secondary objectives:  
a. To evaluate the rate and severity of graft versus host  disease  
b. To evaluate the rates of infectious  complications  
c. To evaluate the rates of disease -free and overall  survival  
2.[ADDRESS_816041] blood (CB) has been investigated clinically 
as an alternative source of hematopoietic progenitors for allogeneic transplantation of 
patients lacking an HLA -matched marrow donor. Fewer T -cells and/or less developed1 
T-cells in CB compared to marrow allows for the possibility that CB grafts will produce 
less Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD), the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the2-4 
allogeneic transplant setting. Other potential advantages include the ability to markedly 
increase the number of allografts available and thus the number of patients w ho could 
be transplanted, given the availability and ease of collecting CB from placental veins 
prior to disposal of the placenta, compared to collecting bone marrow5 or peripheral 
blood progenitor cells (PBPCs)6 from living donors. This source of hematopo ietic 
progenitors has allowed CB banks to target collection of units with human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) types such as those of minority African American and Hispanic 
populations, which are under -represented in the National Marrow Donor Program 
Registry.[ADDRESS_816042] CB transplant performed by [CONTACT_615422]’s group in 1988, more than 5,[ADDRESS_816043] received related or unrelated CB transplants for a variety of 
malignant and non -malignant diseases.8-23 The progression -free survival rates reported 
thus far are comparable to results achieved following allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation. Moreover, there are many reports of what appears to be less GVHD 
than that associated with bone marrow transplants, despi[INVESTIGATOR_615396] -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615397]11,12,16,17,23 or PBPC24-26 allografts. The major disadvantage of CB is the low cell 
dose, which results in slower time to engraftment and higher rates of engraftment failure 
when compared to bone marrow transplantation.27-31 In studies of CB transplantation

times to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of > 0.5 x 109 /L ranged from 22 to  34 days. 
Median times to a transfusion -independent platelet count > 20 x 109 /L varied from 56 to 
over 100 days, with engraftment failure rates of 12 -18%. However, as shown in Table 1, 
the engraftment failure rate for the adult patients (> 18 years old an d/or >45 Kg) in 
those series was substantially higher, ranging from 10 -62%. It is these larger, adult 
patients, who might benefit the most from the fucosylation of CB progenitor cells as 
discussed below.

Rationale for Expanding Cord Blood Cells Ex vivo  
 
Single Umbilical Cord Transplantation  
 
Cord blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615398] 1 log fewer mononuclear cells and 
substantially fewer myeloid progenitors, measured as colony -forming  
units -granulocyte/macrophage (CFU - GM), than do bone marrow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. In most of 
the cord blood transplant studies refe renced above, there appeared to be a threshold 
effect in the total nucleated cell (TNC) dose of unmanipulated cord blood infused and 
time to engraftment, i.e., subjects who received doses above the median for a given 
study appeared to experience superior e ngraftment as compared with subjects who 
received TNC doses below the median. In the study by [CONTACT_615422],16 engraftment and 
survival were superior in subjects who received  3.7 x 107 TNC/kg. This large a cell 
dose is not generally available for subjects wei ghing more than 45 kg. For adult 
subjects it appears that recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880]  1.0 x 107 TNC/kg had more favorable 
engraftment than recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615399].16,[ADDRESS_816044] blood nucleated cells in fused and time to 
neutrophil engraftment (p < 0.002) was reported in the unrelated cord blood transplant 
setting.  
[ADDRESS_816045] Transplantation  
 
Brunstein32 recently analyzed the outcome of 536 subjects who underwent 
hematopoietic cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies at the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center and the University  of Minnesota ([LOCATION_003]). In this study, the [ADDRESS_816046]  4 weeks  longer  than that following  other  graft 
types and often not reached. An important find ing of the study was for the 50% of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615400] (< 26 days), non -relapse mortality was only 16% compared to 41% in those who 
recovered later. The difference was primarily due to different rates of infectious 
complications.  
 
Collectively, these studies suggest giving more cord blood cells may result in faster 
neutrophil recovery. Expansion of cord blood progenitors ex vivo prior to infusion could 
potentially ameliorate inadequat e hematopoietic recovery by [CONTACT_615424] -term reconstitution.  
 
Development of the Mesenchymal Precursor Cells (MPC) -Expanded Cord Blood 
Product  
 
To date, most studies of MPC -expanded cord blood for clinical use have been 
performed using CD34+ or CD133+ immunoselection of the cord blood followed by 
[CONTACT_615425].33 A copper chelator 
tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) has also been used to expand the more primitive 
CD34+ popula tion.34 A significant limitation of the immunoselection method is the low 
recovery of CD34+ and CD133+ cells following the positive selection process. In the 
MD Anderson Cancer Center cord blood expansion study involving CD34+ positive 
selection, the recov ery of CD34+ cells from cord blood units was only 49% (range 4% to 
70%).35 To avoid the unacceptable CD34+ cell losses associated with the positive 
selection procedure, new approaches were  developed.  
 
Ex vivo liquid cord blood expansion removes the primitive hematopoietic progenitors 
from the hematopoietic microenvironment and relies on the addition of exogenous 
growth factors to prevent apoptosis and to stimulate proliferation, potentially driving 
differentiat ion at the expense of self -renewal. Thus, an alternative approach for ex vivo 
expansion is the co -culture of cord blood cells with MSC components of the 
hematopoietic microenvironment. Cord blood -MSC co -culture does not require the 
isolation of CD34+ or CD 133+ cells prior to expansion minimizing manipulation and loss 
of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Starting with cord blood, McNiece36 demonstrated a 
10- to 20 -fold increase in TNC, a 7 - to 18 -fold increase in committed progenitor cells 
(colony -forming cell s), a 2 - to 5-fold increase in primitive progenitor cells (high 
2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 7 of 51 proliferative  potential  colony -forming  cells),  and a 16- to 37-fold increase  in CD34+  cells,  
using an MSC co -culture expansion technique.  
 
As originally developed, it was necessary to generate  primary MSCs from every subject 
or a family member, which severely limited the widespread use of this technology. Many 
subjects do not have an appropriate family member available who can serve as the 
MSC donor. Many other subjects, in particular those wit h acute leukemia, are in fragile 
remissions prior to transplant and at high risk of relapsing during the 4 weeks needed to 
generate the MSCs and then perform the co -cultures. An “off -the shelf” source offers 
major potential advantages over MSCs derived fro m a family member. First, the cells 
can be made available for immediate use without the need for lengthy processing or the 
possibility of contamination during culture. The development of master cell banks from 
young, healthy volunteers offers a way to by[CONTACT_615426] -related decline in stem cell 
function providing the optimal source of MSCs for the cord blood co -cultures. Finally, 
standardization of selection and isolation procedures provides a very reproducible 
product.  
 
Mesoblast International S àrl (Mesobl ast) has developed mesenchymal precursor cells, 
an off -the-shelf allogeneic source of mesenchymal cells and is the provider of MPCs to 
be used for the cord blood unit expansion in this study. Bone marrow cells are 
harvested  from the posterior  iliac crest  of healthy  human  donors.  The mononuclear  cells 
are immunoselected for stromal enrichment using the STRO -[ADDRESS_816047] is produced in compliance with Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP).  
 
After process development work demonstrated MPCs were effective in the ex vivo 
expansion of unselected cord blood37, researchers at  MD Anderson Cancer Center 
treated a cohort of 24 subjects as part of a Phase 2 open -label, noncomparative study 
(study 2005 -0781) using this technology. The results of ex vivo expansion of cord blood 
with MPCs indicate it is feasible to reproducibly gener ate large numbers of stem and 
progenitor cells in a cord blood unit.

This process requires [ADDRESS_816048] blood unit, may take up to 21 days. S everal 
clinical studies showing safety of both approaches are outlined below.  
 
Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies 
Nonclinical Studies  
No formal animal safety or efficacy studies were required by [CONTACT_24623] (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to initiating clinical studies.  
 
Clinical Studies  
 
A Phase 2 study (study 2005 -0781) of MPC -expanded cord blood was conducted by 
[CONTACT_615427]. Results from this study of [ADDRESS_816049] blood transplants, specifically a cohort of similar subjects 
from the Cente r for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 
database, according to its chief scientific director Mary M. Horowitz, MD, MS (personal 
communication, 2010).  
 
Ex vivo , MPC -expanded cord blood along with an unmanipulated cord blood unit wa s 
infused to [ADDRESS_816050] infusion (donor A) used an unmani pulated 
cord meeting the standard HLA and cell dose requirements (HLA matched 4 of 6 [4/6] or 
higher and cell dose 1.5 x 107 TNC/kg). The second infusion used a cord blood unit 
(donor B) that also met the standard cell dose and donor HLA matching requireme nts 
and additionally was expanded ex vivo in co -culture with MPCs.  
 
Patient Demographics and Disposition  
 
The mean subject age was 38.5 years and 58% of subjects were women (Table 2). 
Eighteen of 24 subjects who received transplants had relapsed or high -risk acute 
leukemia (4 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 13 with acute myelogenous 
leukemia [AML], and 1 with myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]/ALL).  
[ADDRESS_816051] Characteristics  
 
Subjects received a mean TNC dose of 8.9 x107 TNC/kg; the mean CD34+ cell dose 
was 2.1 x 106 CD34+/kg. The mean TNC and CD34+ doses in the MPC -expanded cord 
were 6.4x107 (standard deviation [SD] 4.0x107) cells/kg, and 2.0 x 106 (SD 2.3 x 106) 
cells/kg, respectively . By [CONTACT_2163], the mean TNC and CD34+ doses in the 
unmanipulated cord were 2.5 x 107 (SD 8.4x106) cells/kg, and 1.2 x 105 (SD 9.5x104) 
cells/kg, respectively.  
 
Overall, use of an ex-vivo MPC -expanded cord blood cell product resulted in a CD34+ 
cell dose approximately l log higher than the dose achievable from other cord products 
in this size population and within the range of CD34+ cells/kg achievable with other 
progenitor cell types (marrow and mobilized blood cells).  
 
Engraftment Results  
 
The TNC/kg dos e of MPC -expanded cord blood strongly correlated with neutrophil 
recovery (p=0.007) (Figure 1). However, TNC/kg did not correlate with platelet recovery 
(p=0.792). For CD34+ cells/kg dose, there was a trend toward significance for both 
neutrophil and plate let recovery. These data strongly support TNC/kg as a relevant  

[ADDRESS_816052] for neutrophil 
recovery. There was also a trend indicating that CD34+ cells/kg dose correlated with 
both neutrophil and platelet recovery and may therefore also be an indicator of  
MPC -expanded cord blood product potency.  
 
Figure 1. Correlations of Total Nucleated Cells/kg and CD34+ Cells/kg with 
Neutrophil and Platelet Recovery  
 
Of the 24 subjects enrolled, complete or partial response was observed in 19 subjects 
(79%). Of the evaluable subjects, the median time to response was 56.5 days (range 
16-116 days); in the [ADDRESS_816053] follow -up, 
16 subjects had died. Causes of death were infection (n=7), GVHD (n=5), progressive 
disease (n=3), and multi -organ failure (n=1).  
 
Subjects who received ex vivo MPC -expanded cord blood cells in addition to an 
unmanipulated cord blood transplant achieved neutrophil recovery at a median of 15 
days (n=23, range 9 -42 days) and platelet recovery at a median of 43 days (n=17, 
range 18 -62 days). Notably, 21 of 23 evaluable subjects achieved neutrophil recovery 
by [CONTACT_4475] 26. Furthermore, platelet recovery occurred in 17 of 21 evaluable subjects by 
[CONTACT_4475] 100. Overall, 23 subjects had engraftment and there were no engraftment failures 
(Table  3). One subject  was not evaluable  for neutrophil  engraftment  due to death  at day 
31. E ngraftment of neutrophils by 42 days was achieved in all 23 evaluable subjects.  

2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 11 of 51 Table 3: Engraftment Results  
 
Considering the study population as a whole, the median time to neutrophil recovery 
was 15 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.0 -23.0) (Figure 2). The median time to 
platelet recovery to  20 x 109/L was 54 days (95% CI 37 -57) and the median time to 
platelet recovery to  50 x 109/L was 66 days (95% CI 50 -no upper boundary). These 
estimates account for data on subjects who were censore d prior to recovery; they differ 
from the estimates in Table 3, which are based on subjects who recovered.

Engraftment duration was monitored by [CONTACT_615428] a. All subjects 
had donor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615401] (and MPC -expanded or unmanipulated cord blood) by [CONTACT_615429] (VNTR) assay. Both myeloid and T cell chimerism were assesse d. 
Donor T cells were predominantly (  99%) derived from the unmanipulated cord donor 
in 78% (18 of 23) of the subjects by [CONTACT_4475] 100. Donor myeloid cells were predominantly (  
99%) derived from the unmanipulated cord donor in 65% (15 of 23) of the subjects by 
[CONTACT_4475] 100. Several subjects demonstrated mixed chimerism prior to day [ADDRESS_816054]  blood.  
 
Transfusion Results  
 
Platelet and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions were measured to explore hematopoietic 
recovery times with transfusion req uirements and duration of transfusion support. The 
time to last platelet transfusion (median 54.5 days) correlated with the time to platelet 
recovery  50 x 109/L (median 50.5 days) more than platelets recovery to  20 x 109/L 
(median 43 days) (Table 4). S ubjects received a median of 146 units of random donor  

2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 13 of 51 platelets, which was converted to transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_615402] 6 (size of a 
platelet pool) to report the number of platelet transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (median 24.3) and 
platelet  transfusion  epi[INVESTIGATOR_615403] (until  day 100, median  0.5 platelet  transfusions  per 
day). Similarly, the RBC transfusion requirements were 16.5 (median) units transfused 
per subject and the time to last RBC transfusion was 70 days (range 13 -165 days). Red 
blood cell tr ansfusion requirements were not closely associated with times to neutrophil 
or platelet  recovery.  
 
Table 4: Transfusion Outcomes (N=24)  
 
 
Adverse Events  
 
Toxicity and adverse events were expected due to myelosuppression, chemotherapy 
intolerance, and underlying disease. Although many adverse events were deemed 
related to the study treatment (transplant), no adverse events or toxicities were 
considered likel y or possibly due to the investigational agent, i.e., ex vivo  
MPC -expanded cord blood cell product or infusion (Table 5). The most common grade 
3/[ADDRESS_816055] -transplant events of infection and died.  
 
Table 5: All Adverse Events (Pre - and Post -Transplant)  
 
 
Acute GVHD developed in 16 (67%) subjects. Of these, 3 developed grade 3 or high er 
GVHD. The time to GVHD onset for grade 3 or higher was 58 days (range 27 -118 

2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 14 of 51 days). There were no cases of grade 4 GVHD. Chronic GVHD occurred in 10 (53%) of 
19 evaluable subjects. Acute and chronic GVHD were the primary cause of death in 1 
and 4 subjects, respectively.  
 
The frequencies and descriptions of toxicities related to neutropenia were reported from 
day 0 to end of follow -up (Table 6). All [ADDRESS_816056] infection was 22 day s (range 0 -97 days). The median times to 
onset of fever or fever and neutropenia (in the absence of diagnosed infection) were 10 
days each (ranges 8 -10 and 3 -17 days, respectively). Fever with neutropenia was 
experienced by 11 (46%) of 24 subjects; however , unexplained fever in the absence of 
diagnosed infection and/or neutropenia was uncommon. Fever in the absence of 
diagnosed infection occurred more often before day 10.

Survival Outcomes  
 
The median survival time for the 24 subjects at both 1 year and overall was 217 days 
(95% CI 119 -272), indicating that [ADDRESS_816057] study. At 6 months the median survival time was not reached.  
 
 

2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 15 of 51 Summary o f MD Anderson Cancer Center Study  
 
An analysis of the 24 subjects in the MD Anderson Phase 2 study found the median 
time to neutrophil recovery was 15 days (95% CI 14 -24 days) with 88% (21 of 24) of 
subjects recovering within [ADDRESS_816058] atelet recovery was 54 days 
(95% CI 40 -57 days) with 67% (16 of 24) of subjects recovering by [CONTACT_4475] 60.  
The noted improvement in neutrophil and platelet recovering is compelling evidence that 
the graft content of TNC and CD34+ cells correlates with product p otency and 
engraftment kinetics. The marked improvement in platelet recovery indicates an 
engraftment improvement that has not been consistently seen in cord blood 
transplantation. Notably, the expanded MPC cord is an engraftment facilitator and does 
not s pecifically engraft, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_615430] -expanded cord donor 
cell types (at day 100) in chimerism studies. The results of the study can be put into 
context by [CONTACT_615431].  
 
The Center for International Blood a nd Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) also 
identified a matched cohort of subjects receiving double unrelated cord blood 
transplants (N=80) who underwent similar myeloablative conditioning regimens as used 
in the MD Anderson study. They performed a number  of analyses comparing the 
probabilities of neutrophil and platelet recovery. The analysis showed only 53% (42 of  
80) of subjects receiving [ADDRESS_816059] blood units recovered neutrophils within 
26 days (p<0.0001). Similarly, for platelets, only 30%  (24 of 79) of the CIBMTR matched 
cohorts recovered platelets by [CONTACT_4475] 60 (p -value=0.0008). In addition, the median time to 
neutrophil recovery was 25 days (95% CI 22 -28 days) with 53% (42 of 80) of subjects 
recovering by [CONTACT_4475] 26. The median time to platelet recovery was 77 days (95% CI  
65-over 100 days) with only 31% (24 of 79) of subjects recovering by [CONTACT_4475] 60.  
 
In a separately conducted analysis of subjects by [CONTACT_29063], survival at 6 months was 
improved for the engraftment composite success group (defined as n eutrophil recovery 
by [CONTACT_4475] 42 and platelet recovery by [CONTACT_4475] 60) (n=24 of 80 subjects) compared to others 
(81% [95% CI 59% -96%] versus 13% [95% CI 0 -42%]), and improved survival at [ADDRESS_816060] Blood  
 
A critical part of engraftment is the recruitment of primitive hematopoietic progenitor 
cells (HPC) to the bone marrow (BM). This process is governed by a cascade of 
molecular interactions between members of the selectin, integrin and CD44 
superfamilies of adhesion molecules expressed by [CONTACT_615432].38-[ADDRESS_816061]  in part, to low total nucleated  cell (TNC)17,50  and CD34+  cell51 dose,  there  
2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 16 of 51 is evidence that CB CD34+ cells may also have a defect in homing to the bone  
marrow.52,53 In vitro (rolling) and in vivo (homing) evidence suggest that CB CD34+ cells 
interact poorly with selectins when compared to CD34+ cells from PB or marrow. 
Appropriate carbohydrate modification (fucosylation) of selectin ligands appears to be 
critical for the rolling of primitive hematopoietic cells on P - and E -selectin s expressed by 
[CONTACT_615433].47,52,53 An in vitro correlation has been demonstrated 
between the level of CB CD34+ fucosylation and binding to P - and E -selectins.52 More 
heavily fucosylated CD34+ cells exhibit a greater affinity for P - and E -selectins than less -
fucosylated CD34+ cells. The correlation between the level of fucosylation of engrafting

Levels of fucosylation can be markedly increased by [CONTACT_615435] a

augment the level of P - and E -selectin binding of  CD34+ cells as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_615436] P - or E-selectin in vitro under flow 
conditions52, and vascular rolling, through an intravital imaging technique.[ADDRESS_816063] low levels of surface fucosylation. 
Thus for our recently published phase II study,54 we postulated that by [CONTACT_615437], potentially improving homing 
and engraftment. We used the NOD -SCID IL -2Rgnull (NSG) mouse model33 to explore 
the impact of fucosylation on the rate and magnitude of engraftment with the goal of 
improving engraftment following CB transplantation in the clinic.  
 
Development of fucosyltransferase (FT) -VI for clinical use. The laboratory 
conditions for use of FT -VI included incubation of CD34+ cells at 37°C, for 30 minutes 
with 10 mM manganese in HBSS containing 1% HSA. To refine the procedure for 
clinical use, we performed flow cytometry with HECA -452 antibody (BD Bioscience) to 
sialyl Lewis X (sLex)/cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), a fucosylated selectin 
ligand, to measure the levels of cell surface fucosylation.4;83;86 Optima l conditions for the 
fucosylation of selected CB CD34+ cells required at least 30 minutes of incubation with 
FT-VI enzyme at *160 mU/ml, at room temperature in HBSS containing 1% HSA and 1 
mM GDP  ꞏ-fucose and 1 mM MnCl2. (*1 mU FT -VI is defined by [CONTACT_615438] -VI that transfers 1 nMol of GDP -Fuc to Gal1 -•-4 GlcNAc -•-PNP in 1 
hour.) Fucosylated CB MNC remained stably fucosylated for up to 2 hours as assessed 
by [CONTACT_615439] -452 staining (Figure 3).

Fucosylation of CB MNC. Since CB CD34+ cell selection is time -consuming, 
expensive, and results in significant CD34+ cell losses, experiments were performed to 
determine whether fucosylation of unmanipulated CB mononuclear cells (MNC) would 
be feasible. Near maximal fucosylation of the CD34+ cells in the CB MNC preparation 
was achieved over a significant range of CB MNC cellularities (from 8 -64x106 cell/ml) ( 
Figure 4 ) suggesting that fucosylation of CD34+ cells in an MNC preparation containing 
108 cells/ml is feasible without a r eduction in enzyme efficacy.  
 
Figure 4.  
 
 
 
Improved engraftment after fucosylation of minimally manipulated CB cells. To 
exploit the in vitro conditions in animal studies, we treated CB CD34+ and CB MNC with 
FT-VI, washed the cells after the fucosylation procedure to remove residual Mn2+ and 
infused them into sublethally irradiated (270 cGy), NSG mice (5 mice/group): ( A) CB 
CD34+ ± FT -VI. Each mouse received ~4.5x104 CB CD34+ cells ± FT -VI treatment 
cells and was monitored longitudinally via retro -orbital bleeding for the presence of 
human cells in the peripheral blood by [CONTACT_615440]45+  antibody. 
Human engraftment in mice receiving CB CD34+ cells treated with FT -VI was detected 
more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (earlier) and at a significantly higher level  (~4-fold) than in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615404]34+ CB cells ( Figure  5A). 
 
(B) CB MNC ± FT -VI. Since the processes associated with the selection of CB CD34+ 
cells result in significant cell losses and since CB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615405] 
(non-selected pr oducts) at transplant, the efficacy of fucosylation on engraftment 
following unmanipulated CB MNC ± FT -VI treatment was investigated.  
Sublethally -irradiated NSG mice received 6x106 MNC containing ~2.5x104 CB CD34+ 
cells (5 mice/group). Consistent with resu lts observed when selected CD34+ cells were 
fucosylated using FT -VI, human engraftment in mice receiving MNC treated with FT -VI 
was detected more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (earlier) and at a significantly higher(>3 -fold) level than in  

2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 18 of 51 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615406] M NC160 ( Figure 5B ). 
 
 
 
 
These data suggest that fucosylation of minimally manipulated CB cells is an effective 
strategy to improve the speed and magnitude of engraftment. The persistence of 
engraftment over the longer term (>8 weeks, data not shown) suggests that fucosylation 
does not negatively impact the long -term repopulating capacity of the graft.  
 
In our Phase II study we found that the median time to neutrophil and platelet 
engraftment after 30 minutes of fucosylation prior to infusion with one CB unit was 17 
days (range 12 -34 days) and 33 days (range 18 -100 days).54 (Figure 6)  

[ADDRESS_816064] blood has higher endogenous fucosylation than unmanipulated 
CB. These cells then can be fucos ylated to maximally express CLA/sLEX. (Figure 7)

Double Cord Blood Transplants  
 
In an attempt to increase the number of CB cells infused following high -dose or 
nonmyeloablative therapy,  investigators have combined two units of differing HLA types 
and infused them as allogeneic hematopoietic support. Barker et al.reported results o f  
patients transplanted with two unmanipulated CB units.68 Eight adults, with a median 
age of 47 years (rang e 22-56) and median weight of 81kg (range 63 -109), were enrolled 
on the study. Of 7 patients alive without relapse at day +28, all had 97 -100% donor 
chimerism on day +21 marrow biopsy. ANC recovery of 0.5 x 109 /L occurred at a 
median of 25 days (range 21 -28). The authors concluded that their data support the 
principle that transplantation of two immunologically distinct CB units is safe in terms of 
crossed immunological rejection. Graft failure was not observed, but the majority of 
patients did engraft wit h only a single CB unit. In the current trial we will use two CB 
units, one of which will be co -cultured with MPCs for expansion then fucosylated in 
attempt to reduce the time to engraftment in CB transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_615407] 20 -30

3.0 Background Drug Information  
1. Antithymocyte globulin  (ATG)  
THERAPEUTIC CLASSIFICATION: Immunosuppressant.  
MECHANISM OF ACTION: ATG is a rabbit anti -thymocyte globulin. It is a purified, 
sterile, primarily monomeric IgG fraction of hyperimmune serum of selective 
immunosuppressant. It is believed to act by [CONTACT_615441].  
PHARMACEUTICAL DATA: ATG is diluted in 0.9% NaCl. ATG is given intravenously 
as a [ADDRESS_816065] ions are known, it is recommended to 
administer ATG alone.  
STORAGE AND STABILITY: Commercially available. Solution for infusion contains 1 
mg of ATG/2 ml. It should be stored in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (do not freeze).  
Diluted ATG is stable for 24 hou rs. 
KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS: ATG may cause cytopenia of any cell line, chills, fever, or 
edema. A serum -sickness like syndrome may also develop. Adverse reactions 
including rash, pruritus, urticaria, wheal and flare reactions, bronchospasm bleeding 
and anaphyla ctic shock have been reported. Resuscitation equipment should be 
available during administration. After an anaphylactic reaction, infusion should not be 
resumed.  
2. Busulfan  
Therapeutic Classification : Antineoplastic Alkylating agent.  
 
Pharmaceutical data: Busulfan injection is a sterile, pyrogen -free solution provided 
in a mixture  of dimethylacetamide  (DMA)  and polyethyleneglycol  400 (PEG400).  It is 
supplied in 10 ml single use ampoules at a concentration of six (6) mg busulfan per 
ml. Each ampoule contains  60 mg of busulfan in 3.3 ml of DMA and 6.7 ml of 
PEG400. When diluted in normal saline or D5W to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml,  the  
resulting solution must be administered within eight  
 
(8) hours of preparation including the three (3) hour infusion of the  drug.  
 
Stability and storage: Ampoules should be stored refrigerated at 2 -8°C (35 -46°F). 
Stable at 4°C for at least twelve (12) months. Additional stability studies are in 
progress. DO NOT use beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. DO NOT use if the solution is 
cloudy or if particulates are present.  
 
Solution Preparation: Prepare the busulfan solution as follows (the patient will 
receive their busulfan “test” dose at 32 mg/m2 either as an outpatient prior to 
admission or as an inpatient on Day -9. Busulfan pharmacoki netics will be 
performed with the test dose and the day -7 dose and doses for day -7 to day -4 are 
subsequently adjusted to target an AUC of 4,000 microMol.min -1 then mixed into 
normal saline to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL.  
 
In each bag 6.0 mg busul fan (1.0 ml at 6 mg/ml and 11 ml saline) should be added 
to compensate for drug lost in the tubing with each infusion (approximately 12 ml at  
0.5 mg/ml is lost in the tubing when using the controlled rate infusion pump).  
 
Route of Administration: It is to be noted, that a sufficient amount of diluted  busulfan 
should be added to compensate for the amount needed to prime the IV tubing; 
when hanging the infusate, the tubing should be primed with the busulfan solution 
and connected as close to the patient as po ssible. After completed infusion, the 
tubing with remaining busulfan (approximately 12 mL) should be disconnected and 
[ADDRESS_816066] dose of busulfan is given over 45 minutes and the hi gh-dose busulfan will 
be given by [CONTACT_46598] (3) hours into a central venous 
catheter.  
 
CAUTION: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
 
An infusion pump will be used with the busulfan solutions as prepared above. A ne w 
infusion set must be used for administration of each dose. Prior to and following 
each infusion, flush the catheter line with normal saline or (approximately 5 ml).  
Start the three -hour infusion at the calculated flow rate. DO NOT infuse 
concomitantly with another intravenous solution of unknown compatibility.  
 
If a delay in administration occurs after the infusion solution is prepared, the 
properly identified container should be kept at room temperature (20 -25°C), but 
administration must be completed w ithin eight (8) hours of preparation including the 
three (3) hour drug infusion.  
 
Adverse Events: Dose limiting toxicity is expected to be hematological when used 
without stem cell support. Other toxicities seen frequently following high -dose  
busulfan in p reparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation include: VOD, 
nausea, vomiting, pulmonary fibrosis, seizures, rash, and an Addison’s -like 
syndrome.  
 
Mechanism of action: Interferes with DNA replication and transcription of RNA 
through DNA alkylation, a nd ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic acid 
function.  
 
Animal Tumor Data: Busulfan has been shown to be active against a variety of 
animal neoplasm in vivo, including mouse sarcoma 180 and Ehrlich’s mouse ascites 
tumor.  
 
Human Pharmacology : Limited pharmacology data are available for the parenteral 
formulation to be used in this study and is detailed in the evaluation of IV Bu in a Phase 
II Trial using IV Bu at 0.8 mg/kg BW given over 2 hr every 6 hr for a total of 16 doses 
(Andersson et al, 2002) and when administered once daily for 4 days at a dose of 130 
mg/m2 in combination with Flu (Madden et al, AHS 2003, de Lima et al, BLOOD 2004). 
The pharmacokinetic data suggests that the plasma decay of the formulation fits an 
open one -compartment mo del with linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 12  
mg-130 mg/m2. Based on studies of oral Bu, the drug is reported to be extensively 
metabolized; twelve (12) metabolites have been isolated, but most have not been 
identified. The drug is slowly excret ed in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid. Ten 
to fifty percent (10 -50%) of a dose is excreted as metabolites within twenty -four (24) 
hours (Nadkarni 1959).  
 
2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 23 of 51 3. Cyclophosphamide  
Therapeutic classification: Antineoplastic alkylating agent  
Mechanism of action: Interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and 
transcription of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and ultimately results in the disruption of nucleic 
acid function.  
Pharmaceutical data: Lyophilized cyclophosphamide for injection contains 75 mg of  
mannitol per 100 mg of cyclophosphamide (anhydrous) and is supplied in vials for

recommended; this product will withstand brief exposure to temperatures up to 86ºF 
(30ºC) but shoul d be protected from temperatures above 86ºF. Reconstituted 
lyophilized cyclophosphamide for injection is chemically and physically stable for 24 
hours at room temperature or for 6 days in the refrigerator; it does not contain any 
antimicrobial preservative  and thus care must be taken to assure the sterility of 
prepared solutions.  
Known side effects: Dose limiting toxicity is hematologic. Nausea and vomiting is 
common. Anorexia and, less frequently, abdominal discomfort or pain and diarrhea may 
occur. There are isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration and 
jaundice occurring during therapy. Azotemia has been reported. Alopecia and 
hypersensitivity reactions when high doses are utilized. Hemorrhagic cystitis may 
develop in patients treat ed with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe   
and even fatal. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported  
with doses as low as 2.4 g/m2 to as high as 26 g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive 
antineoplastic multi -drug regimen or in conju nction with transplantation procedures.  
Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis has been reported in patients receiving high doses of 
cyclophosphamide over a prolonged period.  
Note: It is recommended that administration of azoles should be avoided before and 
durin g infusion of cyclophosphamide.

Preparative regimens used in this study are commonly used for CB transplantation. The 
selection of these will depend on patient’s ag e, disease and co -morbid condition.  
Prior to initiating chemotherapy in this study, twenty -one or more days must have 
elapsed since the patient's last radiation or chemotherapy administration (Hydrea, 
Gleevec and other TKI inhibitors as well as intra -theca l therapy are accepted 
exceptions). Patients will have a back -up graft from any of the following: an available 
fraction of autologous marrow; or PBPCs harvested and cryopreserved; or family 
member donor; or a third cord blood unit.  
 
Study Design  
 
Once cons ented, the CB units will be shipped to MD Anderson. The CB unit which is the 
least well HLA -matched will be expanded with MPC while the better HLA -matched CB 
unit will be fucosylated. If both CB units have the same HLA -match, the smaller unit 
(lower total nucleated cell dose) will be expanded and larger fucosylated.  
 
Patients will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_607815] -11, -10, or -9 for hydration and will 
receive the designated preparative regimen as described in Preparative Regimens,  
below.  
 
The CB unit to b e expanded will be thawed and undergo ex vivo expansion by  
[CONTACT_3252]-culture on MPCs. Four to seven days prior to the thawing and washing of the CB 
unit that will undergo expansion, a container of MPCs is thawed and expanded into 
culture flasks. The CB unit to undergo expansion is evenly divided among 10 flasks of 
MPCs for the co -culture expansion. After 7 days of co -culture of the CB cells on the 
MPC adherent cells, the non - adherent CB cells are collected from the flasks containing 
the MPCs and transferred to cell culture bags. Culture of any residual CB cells 
remaining in the MPC flasks is also continued. Cells in both bags and flasks are 
cultured expanded for an additional 7 days. After a total of 14 days in culture,  the 
non-adherent CB stem cells from both the bags and flasks are pooled together. The 
other CB unit will be incubated with GDP -fucose and the enzyme  
fucosyltransferase -VI (FT -VI) for up to [ADDRESS_816079] Blood: The unmanipulated CB units are obtained from the 
National Marrow Donor Program, Netcord, and other suitable registries and are 
matched with the subject at 4, 5, or 6/6 HLA class I (intermediate resolution) and II (h igh 
resolution)  loci. 
 
On day 0, the CB unit will be thawed, fucosylated, washed, and infused, followed by [CONTACT_615449] -expanded CB unit. The infusions will be separated by a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_816080] Y -type blood/solution set 
with large blood filter 170 to 260 micron filter by [CONTACT_5204] (IV) via gravity. CB 
2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 32 of 51 units are not to be infused with the use of an infusion pump. The rate of administration 
of the CB units is not to excee d 250 mL/hour (maximum infusion rate).

Monitoring Time to Engraftment . The distribution of time to engraftment will be 
estimated using Kaplan -Meier plots and the relat ionship to covariates evaluated by 
[CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_615417]. Time to engraftment will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_615451]., assuming an accrual rate of 10 patients 
per year with a maximum sample size of 25 patien ts. A mean time to engraftment 
(TTE) of 7 days will be considered desirable and a mean TTE of 21 days will be 
considered undesirable. The design is based on the assumptions that mS = standard 
(historical) mean time -to-engraftment follows an informative Inv erse Gamma (51, 350) 
prior, with a mean of 7 days and variance of 1, and that mE follows a non -informative 
Inverse  Gamma  (2.49,  10.43)  prior,  which  also has a mean  of 7 days  but a much  larger 
variance of 100. The possibly right -censored times time-to-engraftment will be 
monitored continuously throughout  the trial. Accrual will be terminated due to futility if 
at any time during the trial Prob(mE < mS | data) < .0985. This cut -off was chosen to 
ensure a small early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_615418] = 7 days 
(median = 4.85 days). The operating characteristics of this monitoring rule were 
computed using the program TTEDesigner version 1.2.2, available from the MDACC 
Department of Biostatistics ( Table 3 ). The trial will be co nducted using the Clinical 
Trials Data Monitoring website maintained by [CONTACT_615452].

Infusion -related mortality (IRM) is defined as death within 24 hours that is definitely

Monitoring GVHD. GVHD4 = grade [ADDRESS_816102] disease within 42 days will be 
monitored using the Bayesian statistical method of Thall and Sung (1998), De noting pE  
= Pr(GVHD4 with the experimental therapy), the historical value .20 will be considered 
acceptable and .40 unacceptable. Assuming that pE follows an uninformative 
beta(.20,.80) prior, and that the historical probability pS follows an informative 
beta(200,800) prior, accrual will be terminated early if Pr( pS < pE | data) > .95.  
Applying this rule after each cohort of 4 patients, the trial will be stopped if [# patients 
with GVHD4] / [# patients evaluated ] is greater than or equal to 3/4, 4/8, 6 /1 2, 7/16, 8

9.0 Criteria fo r Response  
Disease Response Is defined according to disease specific criteria as per the CIBMTR.  
 
Engraftment is defined as the evidence of donor derived cells (more than 95%) by 
[CONTACT_615453] [ADDRESS_816103] blood 
infusion.  
 
Other definitions used to assess engraftment:  
 
Neutrophil recovery is defined as a sustained absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 0.5 x 
109 /L for [ADDRESS_816104] day of three (3) consecutive days that the A NC exceeds 
0.5 x109 /L. 
 
Delayed engraftment is defined as the evidence of engraftment beyond day [ADDRESS_816105] 
blood unit infusion achieved after the administration of therapeutic (high dose) 
hematopoietic growth factors.  
 
Primary Graft failure is defined as failure to achieve an ANC > 0.5 x 109 /L for [ADDRESS_816106] blood infusion, with no evidence of donor derived 
cells by [CONTACT_615454].  
 
Secondary graft failure is def ined as a sustained declined of ANC <0.5 x 109 /L for 7 
consecutive days unresponsive to hematopoietic growth factors in the absence of 
relapse after initial documented engraftment or loss of donor chimerism in the absence 
of leukemic relapse.  
 
Autologous reconstitution is defined by [CONTACT_615455] > 0.5 x 109 /L without 
evidence of donor -derive cells by [CONTACT_615456]. This can occur at 
initial engraftment or later after initial engraftment has been documented.  
 
Treatment of Engraftment  Failure. Will be further defined according to patient's 
condition and type of graft available following the SCT&CT guidelines for treatment of 
graft failure.

Causality Assessment  
 
The investigational component of the treatment plan of this study is the infusion of an 
MPC -expanded, then fucosylated CB unit in conjuncti on with an unmanipulated CB unit.  
 
The infusion of an MPC -expanded then fucosylated CB unit has not been fully tested in 
humans and the side effects are not well understood. Therefore, for the purpose of this 
study when in the presence of an adverse event which a direct relationship to the 
fucosylated CB unit is supected, the casualty of the event will be attributed to the 
fucosylation plus MPC expansion.  
 
In this study the treatment plan (preparative regimen followed by [CONTACT_615458]) is 
defined as t he “transplant package”. Therefore, events known to be caused by 
[CONTACT_615459], infections and 
supportive treatment will be scored as unrelated to the fucosylation.  
[ADDRESS_816107] common expected adverse events  
 
1. Infections  in the presence or absence of neutropenia: fungal, bacterial and or  viral 
infections.  
2. Fever : Non -neutropenic or neutropenic without  infection  
3. Acute graft versus host disease  (aGVHD): most commonly manifested by [CONTACT_615460], diarrhea and abnormal liver function tests could also present with some 
degree of fever, upper gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting)  mucositis 
and eye  dryness.  
4. Gastrointestinal (GI tract): the GI t ract manifestations could be not only due to 
direct  damage  from the preparative  regiment  but also be a manifestation  of GVHD 
or infections. Therefore, the time, course, and its presentation are crucial when 
assessing these as adverse events. Nausea/vomitin g, mucositis, and diarrhea 
when presented within first [ADDRESS_816108] likely will be related to the 
preparative  regimen.  
5. Skin rash: not related to GVHD could be caused by [CONTACT_615461].  
6. Transaminitis:  liver function test  elevation.  
7. Pulmonary events: not related to CHF most likely caused by [CONTACT_615462]. These could present with a pneumonitis pattern manifested with 
shortness of breath, pulmonary infiltrates on chest r adiograph, sometimes 
accompanied  by [CONTACT_615463][INVESTIGATOR_615420] a diffuse bilateral alveolar  pattern.  
8. Cytokine Storm/ engraftment syndrome: most likely caused by [CONTACT_615464].  
9. Hemorrhagic cystitis: not related to chemotherapy agents used in the  proposed 
preparative regimen is most likely caused by [CONTACT_615465].  
10. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura  (TTP).  
11. Veno -occlusive Disease of the Liver (VOD): known to have a higher incidence  in 
patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy. Some antimicrobial agents have 
been also incriminated in its  development.  
12. Fluid overload due to hydration required for conditioning regimen, blood  product 
transfusions and or IV  alimentation  
13. Graft failure.  
14. Chronic  GVHD.  
15. For the purpose o f this study the following events would not be considered adverse 
events and would not be recorded in the  database:  
1. Flu-like symptoms not associated with  infection  
3. Abnormal laboratory findings considered associated to the original  disease  
4. Isolated changes in laboratory parameters such as electrolyte, magnesium 
and metabolic imbalances, uric acid changes, elevations of ALT, AST,  LDH 
and alkaline  phosphatase.  
 
 
2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 45 of 51 Adverse events considered serious  
 
1. Prolonged  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46532]/or  organ  failure  requiring  extensive 
supportive care (i.e. dialysis, mechanical  ventilation).  
2. Readmissions from any cause resulting in a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>10  days).  
3. Graft Failure/ rejection.  
4. Any expected  or unexpected  event  resulting  in an irreversible  condition  and/or 
leading to  death.  
 
Adverse events data collection  
 
Adverse events will be collected in PDMS/CORe as applicable.  
 
From the start of preparative regimen up to D+[ADDRESS_816109] the onset and resolution date and maxim um grade; beyond this point some 
events considered related to chronic GVHD or late complications post transplant might 
be recorded only with the first date of their awareness with no grade or resolution date. 
Intermittent events should be labeled as such a nd followed until resolution.  
 
If a patient is taken off study while an event is still ongoing, this will be followed until 
resolution unless another therapy is initiated. Pre -existing medical conditions will be 
recorded only if an exacerbation occurs duri ng the active treatment period. Co -morbid 
events will not be scored separately.  
 
Adverse events will be documented based on progress notes, including the flowsheet, 
in the electronic patient medical record (EPIC).  
 
PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol and all 
protocol specific data will be entered into PDMS/CORe.  
 
Concurrent medication  
 
As stated in the treatment plan, patients treated on this protocol will require supportive 
care treatment (concurrent medications). These medications are considered standard of 
care and have no scientific contributions to the protocol, therefore no data will be 
captured on the various medications needed or their side effects.  
 
Serious Adverse Events Reporting (SAE)  
 
An adverse event or  suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
 Death  
 A life-threatening  adverse  drug experience  – any adverse  experience  that places  the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it 
[ADDRESS_816110] caused  death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_615421]  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct 
normal life  functions.  
 A congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
 Incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD)  Grade 3 over  50%.  
 CTCAE grade  3 reactions related to the study cell  infusion.  
 CTCAE  grade   3 organ  toxicity  (cardiac,  dermatologic,  gastrointestinal,  hepatic, 
pulmonary, renal/genitourinary, or neurologic) not preexisting or due to the 
underlying malignancy and occurring  within [ADDRESS_816111]  and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or  at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR  312.32).  
 
 Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious 
adverse  events.  Any important  medical  event  can and should  be reported  as 
an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_438543], IND Office.  
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to t he IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional 
Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events 
for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated ot herwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected 
or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 
working days of knowledge of the  event).  
 All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study 
drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND  Office.  
 Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized 
for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC  IRB. 
 Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the  first 
protocol -specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_816112] returned to 
baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable 
resolution of the event.  
 Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_816113] be reported to the  IND 
Office. This may include the development of a secondary  malignancy.  
2016 -0051  Version 11.0 11 March 2021  Page 47 of 51 Reporting to FDA:  
 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR  312.32.

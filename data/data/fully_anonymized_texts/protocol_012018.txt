1.[ADDRESS_561533] form of treatment is urethral dilation using a balloon, or rigid dilators.  The 
normal urethral caliber is 24-26F at the external  urinary meatus, a little  wider in the penile 
urethra, and about 36F at the bulbar urethra.13  
The principle of urethral dilation is to stretc h the urethral stricture up or to disrupt it to 
restore the urethral caliber to normal or ther eabout.  Urethrotomy and dilation are equally 
effective with expected cure rate  of about 50% for short bulbar urethral strictures when first 
used.  The success rate of repeated procedure is lower13.   
When strictures recur, they usually do so with in weeks or months and almost always within 
two years.  The expected recurrence rate re ported are schematically summarized in Figure 
1-2.

1.4 History of Use of Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel has been used extensively and successfully in drug-coated devices to reduce the 
rate of stenosis in vascular tissue.  Examples  of the devices coated with this drug and the 
dates of approval in the US are shown in Tabl e 1-1.  The improvement in restenosis rates 
led Urotronic to design a similar sy stem to treat urinary strictures.

Drug Coated Balloon US Approval Date 
[LOCATION_011] Taxus DES [ADDRESS_561535] inva sive treatment for strictures .  However, because of the 
nature of strictures, recurren ce of the stricture (50% - 75% ) following balloon dilation is  
common2.  When stricture recurs after balloon d ilation, treatment often progresses to more 
invasive treatments: internal urethrotomy is a slightly more invasive approach that involves an endoscopic incision of the stricture, but is not more effe ctive than dilation
8,9,10; 
urethroplasty is an open surger y for stricture disease that is  more effective but far more 
invasive than dilation or internal urethrot omy.  Urethroplasty is performed by a minority 
(~2%) of urologists and the vast majority of subjects are managed by [CONTACT_442046][INVESTIGATOR_014].  Any improvement in technique or  means of changing the natural history and 
progression of the disease would make a si gnificant clinical c ontribution.  The study 
described below is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug coated 
balloon (DCB).    
2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
 
Figure 2-1:  Urotronic 0.038” Pacl itaxel-Coated Balloon Catheter  
 
The Urotronic Drug Coated Balloon (DCB) is a 0.038” guidewire compatible over-the-wire 
catheter with a tapered atraumatic tip. The dist al end of the catheter  has a semi-compliant 
inflatable balloon coated  with a proprietary coating cont aining the drug paclitaxel and 
carriers that facilitates the drug’s transfer to the urethr al wall upon inflation.    
Paclitaxel is an anti-inflamma tory and anti-proliferative drug commonly used to prevent 
arterial restenosis. The drug coating covers only the balloon body.  Initially, the device will 
be available in one size only 24Fr diameter.   Urotronic believes this size will be sufficient 
to treat the majority of the stricture.  However, during the study, other sizes may be 
introduced if the need arises. 
The device has two radiopaque marker bands th at indicate the drug coated working length 
of the balloon under fluoroscopy.  The device is provided steril e, and is intended for single 
use only.

 6.4.2 DCB Treatment 
The DCB should be prepared per the Instructions for Use (IFU ).  A summary is provided 
below.  If the summary is different from th e IFU, follow the instruction for the IFU. 
 Predilation 1. Perform a baseline urethr ogram if one was not reco rded within [ADDRESS_561556] uncoated balloon (POBU), plain old 
balloon urethroplasty).  Do not exceed ra ted burst pressure of the balloon.  If 
the stricture is not dilatable ( Dilatable is defined as stricture diameter post 
prHGLODWLRQLQFUHDVHE\ 20F by [CONTACT_442049] n), the subject will be treated per DVIU prior to DCB treatment. 
6. If DVIU is indicated (see Figure 6-1); perform DVIU in 3 positions 
(approximately: 12 o’clock, 5 o’ clock and 7 o’clock).   
7. Perform a urethrogram.  If the lumen is  <20F, perform predilation with an 
uncoated balloon.  Record lumen size with urethrogram.   
DCB Treatment 
8. Ensure that the urethra is flushed with saline and fill the bladder with saline 
before introduction of the DCB. 
9. Position the DCB across the predilated or DVIU treated stricture with the 
cystoscope proximal to th e balloon (away from the bladder) to visualize the 
proper placement of the balloon across th e stricture.  Leave the balloon in 
position uninflated for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_561557] I Clinical Study                               DSC016 Rev F

inflation pressure. 
13. Remove the device(s).   
14. Collect urine sample (2nd void): 
a. Ask subject to void or palpate the bladder to allow about 1 cup (100 
– 150ml) of fluid to fl ow out of the urethra to flush any residual 
coating particles. This is recognized as the 1st void  
b. Then ask subject to void or palp ate the bladder again, collect the 
urine sample for about 100 ml or any remaining residual fluid for 
analysis. This is recognized as the 2nd void.   
15. Insert a 12-14 Fr Foley catheter (provi ded by [CONTACT_456]) for at least [ADDRESS_561559] be inflat ed at the target stricture to the 
recommended pressure for a minimum of  5 minutes with saline/contrast.

[ADDRESS_561572] of treatment.  The major instruments and assessments administered are described in this section. 
7.1.1 USS Score 
The USS is a numerical score based on five components of an terior urethral stricture 
disease that help dictate operati ve decision-making: (1) urethral  stricture etiol ogy; (2) t otal 
number of strictures; (3) reten tion (luminal obliteration); (4 ) anatomic location; and (5) 
length. The USS describes the essential factors in determining surgical treatment selection 
for urethral stricture disease. The USS is a concise, easily applicable instrument that 
delineates the clinically significant features of urethral strictures. 
7.1.2 Mundy PROM 
This is a validated patient-reported outcome me asure (PROM) for anteri or urethral stricture 
surgery constructed from existing questionnaire.   This PROM defined a succinct, practical, 
and psychometrically robust PR OM designed specifically to quantify changes in voiding

Page [ADDRESS_561573].   
7.1.3 IPSS (Standard) 
The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) contains the well-validated, highly 
reliable and responsive American Urologi cal Association symptom score (AUASS) 
assessment to identify the severity of BPH symptoms.  However, the symptoms of BPH and urinary stricture are very similar and has been used with strictures. 
The first seven questions in the IPSS addre ss frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, 
hesitancy, intermittence, inco mplete emptying, and urgency, a nd scored on a 6-point scale 
(0 to 5).  Although there are no standard reco mmendations for grading patients with mild, 
moderate, or severe symptoms, patients can be tentatively clas sified as follows: 0-7 mildly 
symptomatic, 8-19 moderately symptomatic, and 20-35 severely symptomatic. 
The IPSS also includes the following eighth que stion that is designed to assess the degree 
of "bother" associated with the subject's ur inary symptoms: "If you were to spend the rest 
of your life with your urinary condition just  the way it is now, how  would you feel about 
that?"  Answers range from "delighted" to "t errible" (0-6).  This  question correlates well 
with the overall BPH symptom score and summarizes the impact of urologic symptoms on quality of life. 
The standard IPSS will be administered at baselin e and at each follow-up visit, except the  
one week follow-up.   
7.1.4 IPSS (Acute) 
The acute IPSS is the same as the standard IPSS except that the que stions refer to the 
subject’s condition in the past week instead of the past month.  This IPSS will be 
administered at the one week follow-up visits  and if indicated, at  unscheduled visits. 
7.1.5 International Index of Erectile Function 
The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a standardized, validated, self-
administrated questionnaire that is used to a ssess the subject's erectil e function.  The Sexual 
Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) is part of the IIEF and cons ist of [ADDRESS_561574] 250 ml.  
Outcomes will be recorded for each qualified void on the case report forms and the strip 
recordings collected.  Voiding data will be ob tained with the subjects in the standing or 
sitting position, voiding into the uroflow instru mentation.  The uroflow meter will provide 
the following information:

x Peak flow rate, Qmax ( 5ml/sec to < 15 ml/sec to qualify) averaged over a 2 
second interval 
x Average flow rate 
x Voiding time 
7.2.1 Peak Flow Rate (Qmax) Measurement 
The recommendation for determining the Qmax re ading is to apply the [ADDRESS_561575] Void Residual Urine Volume 
Following uroflowmetry, residual urine volume in the bladder shall be assessed by [CONTACT_442051].   
7.3 Flexible Cystoscopy 
A screening flexible cystoscopy may be performed to confirm th e presence of stricture and 
to estimate the stricture condi tions (length and size) prior to  enrollment in the study.  The 
size and length is to be estimated without crossing the stricture at screening.  A post 
treatment flexible cystoscopy will be perform ed at the 6-month follow-up and subsequent 
follow up when cystoscopy is warranted.  
7.4 Urethrogram  
A retrograde urethrogram (RUG) is  taken to diagnose the strictur e, ensure the stricture is 
dilatable post predilati on, and to assess stricture recu rrence at follow-ups.  The general 
procedure steps are outlined below. 
x Position the patient and fluoros cope equipment so a lateral view, with the urethra in a 
single plane relative to the image is obtained. 
x Retract the foreskin and clean the tip of pe nis with betadine or antiseptic solution. 
x Liberally administer lidocaine jelly over the outside tip and shaft of a short 8F 
introducer sheath. 
x Place the introducer sheath into the tip of the penis.  Then place a markerwire into the 
introducer sheath down into the urethra.  Ensure the markers are visible in the 
fluoroscopic image. This is used for urethogram image dist ance calibration. 
x Attach a 50/50 saline/cont rast loaded syringe to  the introducer sheath. 
x Simultaneously inject the contrast and start a cine to capture the urethrogram.

Descriptive analyses of all AEs and urinary sy mptoms will be provide d in the report.  In 
addition, the report will include tabulated results of study devi ations and device 
malfunctions. 
Details of the statistical analysis will be provi ded in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
 
9 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENT(S) 
For purposes of this study, an adverse event (A E) is defined as any adverse change (i.e., de 
novo  or preexisting condition) from the subject’ s baseline medical c ondition(s) occurring 
during the course of the study.  For the pur pose of AE documentation, the start of the 
course of the study is defined as any time after the treatment has been in itiated.  All AE’s 
will be recorded in the CRF whether considered procedure-related or not, and will be classified as described in Section 9.5.  
Pre-existing conditions will not be  reported as an AE unless there is an adverse change in 
that condition.  Any AE which resolved and then  recurred will be reported as a separate 
AE.   
An AE may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_3433] e subject or discovered as a result of 
questioning or physical examination by [CONTACT_442052].

moderate to severe LUTS prior to treatment.  These symptoms are expected to continue and 
may even worsen slightly prior to improvement as  part of the healing process.  All reported 
LUTS will be documented in the CRF.  Other expected acute but transient worsening of symptoms from the treatment are dysuria, freque ncy of urination, urgenc y of urination, urge 
incontinence, hematuria, slowi ng of the urinary stream and acute retention as the tissue 
heals.  
Worsening or de novo LUTS, dysur ia or non-obstructive hematu ria that occur and resolve 
within 14 days of treatment that do not requ ire intervention (other than catheterization,

 prophylactic antibiotic, anti-in flammatory medication, and pain medication) will not be 
considered an AE as these are expected and part of the healing process.  However, all 
treatment and related symptoms will be recorded in the CRF.  
Intervention as it relates to hematuria includes but is not limited to, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], the 
need to irrigate the bladder and urethra, or the need for transfusion therapy.   
 Common urinary symptoms will be considered  an AE if any of the following occur: 
a. Worsening or de novo LUTS requi ring intervention or persisting 
beyond [ADDRESS_561578] treatment; 
b. Worsening or de novo LUTS requiri ng hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442038], one standard  course of antibiotic, 
anti-inflammatory and/or pain medication; 
c. Hematuria that requires ir rigation or is  obstructive; 
d. Urinary tract infection defined as >10
5 CFU of a single organism plus 
symptoms localized to bladder. 
e. Urinary retention that did not resolv e within 10 days of treatment; or 
f. If de novo LUTS recurs after the sa me symptom is resolved and is 
considered clinically significant.

evaluated for purposes of determining an AE.    
9.3 Urinary Retention Definition 
Urinary retention, also known as ischuria, is a total lack of ability to urinate.  It is 
sometimes referred to as acute urinary reten tion and typi[INVESTIGATOR_442039] a 
catheter or stent to avoid serious complications of the bladder and/or kidney. 
9.4 Obstructive LUTS 
Obstructive LUTS has some symp toms similar to Urinary Rete ntion.  Obstructive LUTS is 
usually a chronic condition and is sometimes referred to as chronic urinary retention.  
Symptoms of obstructive LUTS are: 
x Poor stream 
x Hesitancy 
x Terminal dribbling 
x Incomplete voiding

 x Overflow incontinence (occurs in chronic retention) 
9.5 Coding or Classification of AEs 
Adverse events should be classified accordi ng to their underlying cause , if known (e.g., fever 
resulting from infection should be reported as “infection”).  Symptoms related to a diagnosis 
should not be reported as separate AEs.  In the above example, feve r is a symptom caused by 
[CONTACT_442053].   
Concomitant AEs that are unrelated (in the clinician’s judgment) should be reported as 
separate events. 
 AE determination is based on three levels of evidence: 
 
Level 1 – final diagnosis Level 2 – signs Level 3 – symptoms  
Every effort should be made to collect Level [ADDRESS_561580]  level of severity, 
which is the final diagnosis (L evel 1).  A single AE should not  be reported as multiple AEs 
based on separate symptoms and signs. 
In cases where a diagnosis is not possible, AE determination should be based on the next 
highest level of evidence (i .e., Level 2: signs), followed  by [CONTACT_23805] (Level 3), if 
symptoms are all that are avai lable to the investigator.  
A corrective action (e.g. cathete rization) itself is not an AE but the reason of the 
catheterization may be an AE.  The AE de termination always should be based on the 
reason that a corrective action was taken.  Note: there may be multiple signs or symptoms 
representing only one AE.  Figure 9-[ADDRESS_561581] I Clinical Study                                   DSC016 Rev  D

Example 1 (Diagnosis): prostatitis often has dysuria, urinary frequency, nocturia, difficult 
urination, pain in the groin, pe lvic area or genitals , painful ejaculation, and sometimes, flu-
like symptoms such as fever a nd chills.  If the diagnosis can  be established, prostatitis 
should be the AE, not the other symptoms.  Th e other symptoms may be listed with the AE. 
 Example 2 (Diagnosis): Urinary tract infecti on (UTI) often has dysuria, urinary frequency, 
urinary urgency, 
and hematuria.  If the dia gnosis of UTI can be established, the AE should 
be classified as an infection with sub-classi fication of UTI.  The symptoms may be listed 
with the AE.   
 Example 3 (Sign): Hematuria may lead to other symptoms, such  as dysuria, pain in flank 
and back, in addition to blood in the urine.  A blood clot may obstruct  the urethra and lead 
to urinary retention.  A disease diagnosis is pr eferred but a diagnosis may not be possible.  
In this case, hematuria (with clot retention) should be the AE clas sification/category, not 
the other symptoms. 
 
9.6 Potential Anticipated Adverse Events 
Potential anticipated adverse events are those th at may occur in associ ation with a stricture 
treatment or procedure, include those AEs lis ted below or reported in the literature 
associated with surgical or minima lly invasive stricture procedures :

 Paclitaxel has been reported to prevent pr oliferation (growth of certain cells in the 
body). In this study, the purpose of using paclit axel on the device is to help prevent 
or reduce restenosis (stric ture reoccurring). However,  the risks of exposure to 
Paclitaxel include:  
o Chromosomal abnormalities a nd the risk of cancer  
o Fetal harm when a pregna nt woman is exposed  
o Anaphylaxis (allergic reaction) and hype rsensitivity reaction with paclitaxel 
intravenous infusion 
o Delayed healing of the wound in urethra due to the procedure 
o Potential effect on the liver and kidney s is unknown and have not been studied 
The amount of the paclitaxel delivered is mu ch lower than a single dose of chemotherapy 
provided to cancer patients and the drug a ppears to remain relatively localized.

9.7 Definition of Serious Adverse Event(s) 
An adverse event is considered to be a seri ous adverse event (SAE) if it resulted, or could 
result in, if not mitigated in: 
x Death  
x Is life-threatening 
x Requires the subject to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442041]   
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Is considered an important medical event 
 
Important medical events that may not meet  one of the above definitions could be 
considered SAEs if they jeopard ize the health of the subject or  require surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  An SAE may or may not be related to the 
study procedure.

If an unanticipated adverse eff ect associated with the inves tigational device occurs, the 
investigator shall notify the Sponsor a nd the IRB/EC as soon as possible.   
The Sponsor will investigate the event and notify the authorities and IRB/EC and all other 
participating IRBs/EC and investigators.  Should the Sponsor determine that an 
unanticipated adverse effect presents an unreason able risk to all participating subjects, the 
Sponsor will suspend the clini cal investigation and notify all participating investigators,

event is considered to have been serious.  A dditional information, such  as procedural notes, 
treatment notes, or a si gned clinical summary, ma y be required as supporting 
documentation for the reported AE. 
During the study, all deaths must be reported to  the Sponsor within the period outlined in 
Table 12-1.  All deaths also should also be reported on the End of Study CRF.  A copy of 
the subject’s death records, me dical records for the events th at led to the subject’s death, 
and a death certificate (if avai lable) should be provided. 
 
9.10 Relationship of AE s to the Device 
A description of how an AE relates to the study procedure will be reported on the Adverse 
Event CRF and be determined by [CONTACT_442054]: 
 
x Definite :  The AE follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from the time of the 
index procedure, which includes AEs that  occur during the in dex procedure or 
during the follow-up period. 
x Probable :  The AE follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from the time of the 
index procedure, and the possibility can be excluded that factors other than the index 
procedure, such as underlying disease, c oncomitant drugs, or c oncurrent treatment 
caused the AE. 
x Possible :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from the time of the index 
procedure and the possibility of index pr ocedure involvement cannot be excluded.

 However, other factors such as underlying diseas e, concomitant medications, or concurrent 
treatment are presumable. 
x Unlikely :  The AE has an improbable tempor al sequence from the time of the 
index procedure, or such AE can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604], 
including underlying diseas e, concomitant medication, or concurrent treatment. 
x Not related : The AE has no temporal sequence fro m the time of the index procedure, 
or it can be explained by [CONTACT_1604], including unde rlying disease, concomitant 
medication, or conc urrent treatment. 
Those SAEs that are possibly related to the devi ce, the procedure, or the disease state being 
treated will be reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_456].   
9.11 Device Failures, Malfuncti ons and Near Incidents 
Device failures or malfunctions will be reported to the sponsor by [CONTACT_145889].  If the 
failure or malfunction results in negative clinic al sequelae, the event shall be reported to 
the Sponsor within two (2) working days af ter the Investigator becomes aware of the 
device-related adverse event and reported to the IRB/EC (if required) within the IRB/EC 
required timeframe.  The malfunc tioning investigational devi ce involved in the incident

12 STUDY RESPONSIBILITI ES AND MANAGEMENT 
12.1 Investigator Re sponsibilities  
Each investigator is responsible for ensuri ng the investigation is conducted according to 
all signed agreements, the study protocol, EC/IRB requirements,  and applicable laws and 
regulations.  Also, Investigator s may not begin enrollment un til Sponsor or its designee 
receives and approves (when necessary) the following documents: 
x Signed Investigator Agreement 
x Financial disclosure forms for all participating investigators 
x EC/IRB roster (or IRB registration number fr om the Office of Human Research Protection) 
x EC/IRB protocol and ICF approvals 
x Investigators’ current curricula vitae (CV) 
x Signed Site Delegation Log 
 
It is acceptable for Investigator s to delegate one or more of the above functions to an 
associate or Co or Sub-I nvestigator, or a trained St udy Coordinator; however, the 
Investigator remains responsible for the pr oper conduct of the clin ical investigation, 
including obtaining and documen ting proper study informed c onsent, collecting all required 
data, submitting accurate and complete CRFs, etc. 
At each study site, appropriate procedures must be followed to maintain subject 
confidentiality according to appropriate local regulations.  Each site may have its own 
internal procedures or require ments for use and release of subject medical information in 
research studies.  Each Inve stigator is responsible for obt aining appropriate approvals, 
consents, or releases of medical information as  dictated by [CONTACT_442056]. 
The study is not transferable to other sites attended by [CONTACT_442057]/IRB and the Sponsor.

be required to document the cons ent process within each enrolle d subjects medical record.  
Administering the questionnaires can be  done prior to signing the ICF. 
Only subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, who signed the study enrollment 
informed consent will be cons idered enrolled in the study.  
Timely communication by [CONTACT_442059]. When enrol lment is close to the end of each phase, the 
following procedures will be implemented: 
 
x Before the subject signs the study ICF, the Study Coordinator must confirm the 
availability of an enrollment  slot.  A phone call to the S ponsor or Data Coordinating 
Center is the preferred method. 
x Immediately after the proce dure, the Study Coordinator mu st inform (phone call or 
fax or e-mail) the Sponsor or Data Coor dinating Center to co nfirm the subject’s 
eligibility and the co mpletion of the procedure.  A phone  call to the Sponsor is the 
preferred method. 
 
12.3 Ethics Committee (EC) / Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
Investigators must submit the study protocol to  their respective Ethics Committee (EC) and 
or Institutional Review Board (IRB) and obtain the EC’s/IRB ’s written approval before 
being allowed to conduct and participate in the study.  Each Investigator is responsible for 
fulfilling any conditions of a pproval imposed by [CONTACT_85338] r respective EC/IRB, such as regular 
reporting, study timing, etc.  Investigators will provide the Sponsor or its designee with 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_252473]. 
 
12.4 Informed Consen t Form (ICF) 
The Sponsor will provide a template informed  consent form (ICF) to each study site for 
EC/IRB submission.  The template may be mo dified to suit the requirements of the 
individual study site but the Spons or must pre-approve all changes to the IC F prior to initial 
submission to the EC/IRB.   
Each Investigator or assigned designee mu st administer this approved ICF to each 
prospective study subject, and obtain the s ubject's signature [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a legally-approved 
designee’s signature [CONTACT_442069].  The 
ICF must be obtained in accord ance with the applicable guidelines of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, or local regulations and laws, whichever represents the greater protection of the

12.5 Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
The Sponsor will provide standardized cas e report forms (CRFs) for each individual 
subject.  The CRFs will be electronic (EDC, 21 CRF Part 11 compliant), and will be used 
to record study data, and are an integral part of the st udy and subsequent reports.   
The electronic CRFs for individual subject s will be provided by [CONTACT_124730] a web 
portal.  After the data have b een monitored and submitted, corre ctions will be initiated via a 
data query or Data Clarification Form (DCF) to be completed by [CONTACT_26271].  This 
DCF also will be done electro nically via the web portal.  Electronic CRFs must be

12.8 Sponsor Responsibilities  
Urotronic, Inc. is the Sponsor  of this study.  The Sponsors responsibilities in the study 
include: 
x Selecting the Principal Investigator(s), all clinical investigators and study sites, and 
other consultants (e.g., monitors) who participate in the study. 
x Provide study protocol, device, and GCP tr aining to participating study sites, in 
quantities sufficient to  support study activitie s, per agreements executed with the 
study sites. 
x Select all qualified clinical Investig ators and study sites a nd other consultants (e.g., 
the study monitors) who pa rticipate in the study. 
x Provide financial support to each study site. 
x Follow/promote all regulatory standards pe r appropriate regulati ons for study sites, 
core laboratories, and other participants , and ensure compliance by [CONTACT_214724].

 12.8.[ADDRESS_561591] ing to the country’s patient confidentiality 
regulations.  Data used in the analysis and reporting of this evalua tion will be used in a 
manner without identifiable reference to the subj ect.  Investigators will consent to visits by 
[CONTACT_2728]’s staff and its authorized represen tatives, as well as by [CONTACT_442061], to review the study subjects’ medical records, including any test or 
laboratory data that might have been recorded on diagnostic test media (e.g., urethrogram).

not affect the subject’s safety or the integrity of the data (e.g. administrative changes).  Any 
change that would require alteration to the IC F must receive approval from the applicable 
EC/IRB prior to implementation.  Following approval, any Investigational Protocol 
amendment must be distributed to al l protocol recipi[INVESTIGATOR_442044]. 
12.8.3  Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation/violation is generally an unplanned excurs ion from the protocol that is 
not implemented or intended as a systematic ch ange. An investigator fa iled to perform tests 
or examinations as required by [CONTACT_442062] e protocol, would be considered protocol 
deviations. These type of devi ations are reported to the spons or and in accordance with the 
EC/IRB policy. 
A Protocol Deviation CRF must be completed by [CONTACT_442063] r each study protocol deviation 
(e.g., failure to obtain informed consent, enrolling a subject who does not meet inclusion / 
exclusion criteria, no t performing required testing, mi ssed follow-up window, etc.).  An 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor and the reviewing EC/I RB of any deviation from the 
Study Protocol that was done to pr otect the life or physical we ll-being of a subject.  Such 
notice should be given as soon as possible, but no  later than five (5) working days after the 
emergency occurred. 
12.8.4  Protocol Deviation Notification/A pproval to EC/IRB/Sponsor before 
Implementation 
A protocol deviation may be a limited prosp ective exception to the pr otocol (e.g. agreement 
between sponsor and investigator to enroll  a single subject who does not meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criter ia due to out of window historical data).   
These types of deviations initiated by [CONTACT_442064]/IRB and the sponsor prior to  implementation.  This type of deviation 
can be used for historical data that is out of window (ie) due to date of screening visit. The 
objective is to prevent subjects from being subject to repeat a nd possible invasive testing.  
These type of deviations ar e only approved if they do not impact data integrity or put 
subjects at unreasonable risk.

The clinical study will be monitored according to the guidelines summarized below.  The 
sponsor may choose to perform random inspecti ons throughout the study as an element of 
quality assurance.  Investigators shall allo w auditing of their clinical investigation 
procedures.  
A study specific Monitoring Plan is created a nd implemented to standardize monitoring 
activities across centers and ensure human subjec t protection and verify data integrity.  The 
monitors shall receive study sp ecific and SOP training prior to conducting any monitoring 
visits.  Study monitors are selected based on th eir training, qualifications and experience to 
monitor the progress of an i nvestigation.  Study monitors ma y be Sponsor’s employees or 
representatives.  This study monitoring will include a site qualifica tion, study initiation, 
interim, and close out visits.  All study mon itors will be required to follow the Sponsor’s 
monitoring plan and mon itoring standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
The study monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_214710]:

 13.1.1  Monitoring Visit 
The following factors will be taken into acco unt when determining the frequency of the 
monitoring visits: subject accrual rate at each  center, total number of subjects enrolled at 
each center, and Clinical Investig ation Plan compliance at each center.  It is anticipated each 
site will be monitored at least once upon the completion of the 3-month follow-up visits for 
all enrolled subjects at the study site.  Monitors  will require direct acces s to subjects’ medical 
records pertinent to the study (and study incl usion criteria), study management documents, 
regulatory documents and Subject  Informed Consent documents , as well as other potential 
applicable records not listed here.    Monitors may ensure the clinical investigators ha ve and continue to have  staff and facilities

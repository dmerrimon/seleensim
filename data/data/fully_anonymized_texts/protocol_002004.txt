1.1. Background
1.1.1. Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary  hypertension (PH) is a serious and life- threatening disease of the pulmonary  
vasculature, characterized by  [CONTACT_569279] [1,2] . PH develops in response to 
various pathological conditions, which are categorized as: 1) pulmonary  arterial hy pertension 
(PAH); 2) PH associated with left heart disease; 3) PH associated with lung diseases and/or 
hypoxia; 4) PH due to chronic thrombolic and/ or embolic disease and; 5) PH associated with 
miscellaneous pathologies affecting the pulmonary  vasculature such as sarcoidosis, 
histiocy tosis X, l ymphangiomatosis, or the compression of pulmonary  vessels by  
[CONTACT_569280] y, tumors or fibrosing mediastinitis [3].
PAH consists of a group of diseases characterized by  a progressive increase of pulmonary  
vascular resistance (PVR) and pulmonary  artery  pressure (PAP). PAH includes idiopathic 
pulmonary  arterial hy pertension (I PAH), familial pulmonary  arterial hy pertension (FPAH), 
and PAH associated with various conditions such as connective tissue disease (CTD), 
congenital sy stemic -to-pulmonary  shunts, portal hy pertension, drug and toxin use, and 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [4]. All of these disorders share similar 
proliferative and obstructive changes of the pulmonary  microcirculation, including plexiform 
lesions [5] .
The vascular damage that defines PAH is characterized by  a mean pulmonary  artery  pressure 
(mPAP)  [ADDRESS_746368] or >30 mmHg with exertion and a pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_17931] (PCWP)  15 mmHg. Patients with PAH ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y develop significant increases in 
PVR and sustained elevations in PAP, which ultimately  lead to right ventricular failure and 
death [2,6] . Patients diagnosed with PAH have a poor prognosis and equally compromised 
quality  of life, with a mean life expectancy  of 2 to 5 y ears from the time of diagnosis if 
untreated 
[7]. Drugs that block or reduce the vasoconstriction and hy pertr ophy  associated 
with the narrowing of the pulmonary  arteries may  ameliorate the cy cle of constriction and 
improve pulmonary  vascular blood flow.
1.1.2. Current Treatment Options
Diuretics and anticoagulants have been widely  used in the management of PH, y et treat ment 
response varies [8] . Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have shown improved survival in 
vasoreactive IPAH patients, y et the relativel y low incidence of vasoreactivity  make CCBs 
useful only  in a minorit y of the population with PAH [8,9] .
Three signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of PAH have been targeted for 
therapeutic intervention: the cAMP -dependent prostacy clin (PGI 2) pathway [8] , the 
cGMP -dependent nitric oxide (NO) pathway, and the phospholipase -C-dependent endothelin 
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-[ADDRESS_746369] . These pathways are targeted b y the foll owing classes of drugs: PGI 2derivatives, 
phosphodiesterase t ype-5 (PDE -5) inhibitors, and endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs).
The following summary  is provided for illustration only , as not all treatments are available in 
all markets.
Intravenous (iv) epoprostenol (Flolan), subcutaneous, iv, and inhaled treprostinil 
(Remodulin), and inhaled iloprost (Ventavis) are 
PGI 2derivatives targeting the 
cAMP -dependent PGI 2pathway . These medicinal products mimic the effects of PGI 2, an 
endogenous prostagland
in produced by  [CONTACT_431025], to stimulate cAMP-
dependent vasodilation of the pulmonary  arterial bed and inhibit platelet aggregation [
10]. 
Epoprostenol, a potent vasodilator, i s a treatment option for patients with I PAH and PAH 
associated with connective tissue disease (PAH -CTD). There are several adverse events 
(AEs) associated with the drug including jaw pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting. The 
continuous infusion of epoprost enol requires the use of cold packs and a battery -operated 
ambulatory  pump for 24- hour uninterrupted iv infusion, thereb y necessitat inga substantial 
commitment from patients for successful administration [11,12] . Treprostinil was originally 
given marketing authorization for administration as a continuous, subcutaneous infusion; 
however, use of this chronic prostanoid therap y has been associated with pain at the site of 
administration [13], prompting the development of iv and inhaled formulation s[14]. Inhaled 
iloprost was approved for the treatment of PAH based on demonstrated improvement 
compared to placebo in 6 -minute walk distance (6MWD) and World Health Organization 
(WHO) functional cl ass after [ADDRESS_746370] at night [15]. 
Sildenafil citrate (Revatio), the first PDE- [ADDRESS_746371] . Through inhibition of PDE -5, sildenafil increases cy toplasmic 
cGMP concentr ations and enhances NO- mediated vasodilation of the vasculature [16]. 
Sildenafil demonstrated significant exercise capacity  benefit compared with placebo over 
12weeks of treatment [
17]; however, the long- term effect of the approv ed dose of sildenafil 
(20 mg three times dail y [tid]) as monotherapy has not been established.
The third targeted pathway  is the phospholipase -C-dependent endothelin pathway . 
Endothelin -1 (ET- 1) is the primary  member of a family  of potent vasoconstrictor peptides, 
which are known to play  an essential role in mammalian cardiovascular phy siology  [18] . 
ET
-1 is sy nthesized de novo and released from endothelial cells in response to a variet y of 
factors, including angiotensin II, catecholamines, cytokines , hypoxia, and shear stress 
[19-22]. Two receptor subty pes, endothelin receptor ty pe A (ET A) and endothelin receptor 
type B (ET B), mediate the effects of ET -1. In humans, the ET Areceptor is preferentiall y 
expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and is primarily  responsible for the 
vasoconstrictive andmitogenic effects of ET -1 [23,24] . In contrast, ET Breceptors are found 
mainly  in the vascular endothelium, and their activation results in vasodilation via the 
production of NO an
d prostacy clin [25,26] . The ET Breceptor is also involved in the 
regulation of circulating concentrations of ET -1, through effects on endothelin converting 
enzy me (ECE -1) expression, and the sy nthesis and reuptake of ET- 1 by [CONTACT_196717] 
[
27,28] .
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-0124 Version 2.0
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 12 June 2013ET-1 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_569262] [29]. In healthy  
subjects, circulating plasma concentrations of E T-1 are normally  quite low [30]; however ,in 
patients with PAH, plasma ET -1 levels ar e elevated by  [CONTACT_45848] 10 -fold [30,31] . Such 
elevations in plasma ET -1 also appear to correlate well with increased mean right atrial 
pressure (RAP) in this patient population [31] . ET Aand ET Breceptor mRNAs are abundantl y 
expressed in human lung ti ssue [32] . Similarly , expression of ET- 1 and ET -1 mRNA may  be 
increased as much as 9 -fold in the lung tissue of patients with PAH, primarily  in the 
endothelium of pulmonary  arteries [1]. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that 
ET-1 play s a critical role in the p athogenesis and progression of PAH.
Bosentan (Tracleer®), a non -selective, sulfonamide -class ERA , is approved globall y for the 
treatment of PAH in patients with WHO functional class III or IV s ymptoms. Bosentan was 
demonstrated to increase exercise capacit y in subjects with PAH, and reduce d yspnea during 
exercise [33 -35].
1.2. Ambrisentan
Ambrise ntan [(+) -(2S)-2-[(4,6 -dimethy lpyrimidin - 2-yl)oxy]- 3- methoxy - 3,3-
dipheny lpropanoic acid] is an orally  active ERA that is selective for the ET Areceptor. 
Ambrisentan ( trade name: [CONTACT_569311]™) is approved by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1) in patients with WHO class 
II or III s ymptoms to improve exercise capacity  and delay  clinical worsening. Ambrisentan 
has also been gr anted marketing authorization (under the tradename [CONTACT_569312]™) by [CONTACT_569281] c lass II and III . Additional m arketing applications for ambrisentan have 
been filed or are planned in many  countries world- wide.
1.2.1. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
Clinical studies in healthy  volunteers have demonstrated that ambrisentan is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_569263], with maximum plasma concentrations (C max) typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y observed around 1.5 hours
after oral dosing, under both fasted and fed conditions; therefore, absorption is unaffected b y 
food. In subjects with PAH, ambrisentan was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_569264] C maxtypi[INVESTIGATOR_569265] 2 and 3 hours after dose. For both healthy  volunteers 
and PAH patients, C maxand area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased 
dose proportionally  over the therapeutic dose range, and steady- state was generall y achieved 
following 4 day s of repeat dosing. Stead y-state plasma elimination half -life ranged from 13.6 
to 16.5 hours in healthy  volunteers and from 12.9 to 17.9 hours in patients with PAH. 
Ambrisentan plasma concentrations were consistently  higher (AUC ss,0-24 2-3 fold) in subjects 
with PAH compared to healthy  su
bjects. A similar difference was observed in bosentan 
clinical studies [36]. Reduction in the metabolic capacit y of the liver as a consequence of 
PAH -related hepatic congestion or h ypoperfusion may  alter the s ystemic clearance of 
ambrisentan (as well as other ERAs) in patients with PAH.
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-0124 Version 2.0
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 12 June 2013Ambrisentan is hi ghly plasma protein bound, and the distribution of ambrisentan into red 
blood cells is low. Ambrisentan is primarily  metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_569282] a lesser extent by [CONTACT_25510]. Ambrisentan is glucuronidated by  [CONTACT_569283] e 
glucuronosy ltransferase (UGT) enz ymes (UGT1A9S, UGT2B7S and UGT1A3S) to form 
ambrisentan glucuronide. Ambrisentan glucuronide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_569266]. Ambrisentan undergoes
oxidative metabolism to form 4- hydroxymethyl ambrisentan; however, the AUC of this 
metabolite is approximately  4% of parent ambrisentan in plasma, which indicates that itis a 
minor metabolite. The 4 -hydroxymethyl metabolite is generated primaril y by c ytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4 and to a lesser extent by  [CONTACT_097]3A5 and CYP2C19. The hydrox ylated 
metabolite is further glucuronidated to [ADDRESS_746372]
100-fold less than that of ambrisentan. Therefore at concentrations observed in the plasma 
(~4%), 4 -hydroxy methy l ambrisentan is not expected to contribute to pharmacological 
activity  of ambrisentan. 
Ambrisentan and its metabolites are primarily  excreted in the bile following hepatic and/or 
extra -hepatic metabolism and eliminated in the feces (65%). Approximately 22% of the 
administered dose is recovered in the urine following oral administration ,with 3.3% being 
unchanged ambrisentan. 
Additional details regarding the pharmacokinetic and ADME (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion) properties of ambrisentan, as determined in the ambrisentan 
nonclinical and clinical studies, are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) [ 37].
1.2.2. Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
The nonclinical pharmacology of ambrisentan has been studied in vitro and in vivo. I n vitro 
nonclinical studies with ambrisentan have demonstrated that it is a potent and selective 
inhibitor of the ET Areceptor. I n studies using endogenousl y expressed, native ET Aand ET B
receptors obtained from human ventricular m yocardial membranes, ambrisentan
demonstrated a K i(dissociation constant for the inhibitor) of approximately 0.011 nM for the 
ETAreceptor and a K iof 40 .9 nM for the ET Breceptor, resulting in a 4000- fold selectivity  
for the ET Aversus the ET Breceptor.
The vasodilatory  and antiproliferative effects of endothelin receptor antagonism with 
ambrisentan have been established in several in vivo studies. Ambrisentan has a depressor 
action in the sy stemic circulation of rats and dogs anda vascular antiproliferative effect in
the injured coronary  artery  of the pig .Numerous studies have also been conducted in animals
to evaluate the safety of ambrisentan on the nervous, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , 
gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary  systems . Ambrisentan elicited only  
minor effects in most of these assay s, even at high concentrations or doses. 
The toxicological profile of ambrisentan has been ev aluated in single dose, repeat dose, 
carcinogenicity , and reproductive/developmental studies in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, and 
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-0124 Version 2.0
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 12 June 2013in genotoxicity  studies in vitro (mammalian and bacterial cells) and in vivo (rats). In single 
and repeat dose toxicity  studie s in mice, rats, and dogs, few significant s ystemic or organ 
toxicities were observed. The target organs identified in mice, rats, and dogs with chronic 
ambrisentan administration were the gastrointestinal tract, kidney s, heart, nasal cavit y, and 
testes. I n rats onl y, chronic dosing of ambrisentan was also associated with an increase in 
osseous hy perplasia of the nasal cavities, which in turn led to suffocation and premature 
death in a portion of these obligate nose breathers. 
Teratogenicity  is a class eff ect of ERAs, and exposure of animals to ERAs has been shown to 
cause a specific and potentially  lethal combination of embry onic defects including 
craniofacial, cardiac, and thy roid abnormalities. Oral administration of ambrisentan to 
pregnant rats or rabbi ts on gestation day s 6 to 17 resulted in abnormalities of the lower jaw, 
tongue, and/or palate at all doses evaluated. For humans, this means that the potential 
teratogenic effect of ambrisentan could occur before a patient knows she is pregnant.
The devel opment of testicular tubular atrophy  and impaired fertility  has been linked to the 
chronic administration of ERAs, although the potential for human injury  has not been 
determined. Ambrisentan administration was associated with the development of testicular
lesions in rats, but there was no consistent effect of these lesions on fertility  and/or sperm 
morphology  or motility . In clinical studies, the analy sis of male fertility  hormones in 
combination with the limited number of subjects providing serial semen s amples did not 
suggest that long -term ambrisentan treatment was associated with an adverse effect on male 
reproductive potential.
The genotoxicity  of ambrisentan was assessed in a comprehensive battery of in vitro and in 
vivo studies. Ambrisentan was clast ogenic (structural chromosome damage) when tested at 
high concentrations in mammalian cells in vitro. Ambrisentan was not mutage nic to bacteria, 
and produced minimal evidence of carcinogenic potential in two 104 -week rodent studies.
1.2.3. Potential for Drug- Drug Interactions
The manag ement of PH often requires multi -drug regimens; therefore, the risk of adverse 
drug-drug interactions should be carefull y considered. Concomitant medications for the 
treatment of PAH include anticoagulants, diuretics, CCBs, and digox in. Subjects may  also 
require concomitant therapy  for co-morbidities, such as immunosuppressants for CTD and 
protease inhibitors for HIV infection. In addition, the strat egy of administering more than one
PAH medication to target different pathological mec hanisms is increasingl y being 
implemented.
Ambrisentan parent is the predominant ambrisentan -related species circulating in the plasma, 
and the minor ambrisentan metabolism that occurs is mediated by  a variety  of CYP and UGT 
enzy mes, rather than b y one pre dominant enz yme (Section 1.2.1). Therefore, the 
pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan are unlikely  to be affected b y coadministered drugs that 
induce or inhibit specific phase I or phase II enzymes. 
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-[ADDRESS_746373] demonstrated that ambrisentan does not inhibit 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) or induce ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) CYP or UGT metabolic pathway s at clinicall y 
relevant doses or concentrations. Therefore, administration of ambrisentan is unlikely  to alter 
the pharmacokinetics of other drugs that may  be metabolized by  [CONTACT_569284] s.
In vitro studies using rat and human hepatocy te cultures have demonstrated that ambrisentan 
does not inhibit the organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP), sodium -taurocholate 
co-transporter protein (NTCP), multidrug resistance -associated protein 2 (MRP2), or the bile 
salt export pump (BSEP). R at hepatocy te assay s have demonstrated that ambrisentan does 
not induce protein levels ofBSEP and P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Ambrisentan is a possible 
substrate for the hepatic influx transporter OATP and for the efflux transporter P -gp, but not 
for the hepatic influx or efflux transporters NTCP or BSEP, respectively .
Cyclosporine A is a strong inhibitor of P -gp; therefore, caution should be used when 
ambrisentan is coadministered with cy closporine A [38].
[IP_ADDRESS]. In Vitro Enzy me Inhibition Studies
The ability  of ambrisentan to inhibit hepatic phase I  and II metabolizing enzy mes has been 
evaluated in microsomes prepared from a human ly mphoblastoid cell line or baculovirus-
infected insect cells. Inhibition did not exceed 50% for an y enzy me at the highest 
concentration (300 μM) of ambrisentan tested. These results suggest a low potential for 
ambrisentan to inhibit hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism at clinically  relevant 
concentrations.
[IP_ADDRESS]. In Vitro Enzy me Induction Studies
The activity  of ambrisentan as a modulator of hepatic phase I and II enzyme induction was 
examined in rats and dogs. No induction of CYP, glutathione -S-transferase (GST), or uridine 
diphospho -glucuronosyltransferase (UDP -GT) enzy me concentrations or activities were 
observed at clinically  relevant doses. Enzy me induction that was observed in these studies 
generall y occurred a t the highest doses, corresponding to an equivalent human 
pharmacokinetic exposure that is 50- to200-fold higher than that determined in clinical 
development. Results suggest that ambrisentan should not possess clinically  significant 
hepatic phase I or II metabolizing enzy me induction potential.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Drug -Drug Interaction Studies
Several clinical studies have been conducted with ambrisentan to examine the potential for 
adverse drug -drug interactions. I n EE-002, dail y dosing of ambrisentan (5, 7.5, or 1 0 mg by 
[CONTACT_1966] [po] once daily  [qd] ) did not increase 6 -hydroxycortisol excretion, indicating a lack 
of CYP3A4 induction.
In health y subjects receiving a single dose of sildenafil (20 mg), dail y doses of ambrisentan 
(10 mg qd) did not have a clinically  relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil (a 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrate) or the active metabolite, n
-desmeth yl sildenafil. Similarly ,

of sildenafil or ambrisentan are required when co -administered.

receiving a single 25 mg dose of racemic warfarin. Similarly , warfarin had no clinically  
significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan. In addition, daily  doses of 
ambrisentan (10 mg qd) did not h ave a clinicall y significant effect on prothrombin time (PT) 
or International Normalized Ratio (INR). Consistent with this result, no clinically  relevant 
changes in PT, INR or warfarin- type anticoagulant dose were observed with ambrisentan 
treatment in th eclinical studies of patients with PAH. Therefore, no dose adjustments for 
warfarin or ambrisentan are required when co -administered .
The effect of daily  doses of a mbrisentan (10 mg qd) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 
0.5mg dose of digoxin, a substrate for P -gp, was evaluated in health y subjects. Slight 
increases in the plasma concentrations of digoxin were observed in the presence of daily  
ambrisentan dosing, however, these increases were not considered to be clinically  relevant. 
Based on the results of this study , no dose adjustment of digoxin is recommended with 
ambrisentan co -administration.
Finally , the effects of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ,on the pharmacokinetics of 
ambrisentan were also assessed in health y subjects. Da ily doses of ketoconazole (400 mg qd) 
did not have a clinicall y relevant effect on the single -dose pharmacokine tics of ambrisentan. 
Therefore, no ambrisentan 
dose adjustment is recommended when co -administered with 
ketoconazole .
These clinical data are consistent with the in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies and support 
the conclusion that ambrisentan has a low risk of adverse drug- drug interactions.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Efficacy
In two Phase 3, placebo- controlled studies (AMB -320 [ARI ES-1] and AMB -321 
[ARI ES-2]), ambrisentan demonstrated statistically  significant improvement in 6MWD. An 
increase in 6MWD was observed after 4 weeks of t reatmen t with ambrisentan, with a 
dose-response observed after 12 weeks of treatment. Results from AMB -321 demonstrated 
that 5 mg and 2.5 mg po qd of ambrisentan improved the placebo- corrected 6MWD by  
59.4 meters (p <0.001) and 32.3 meters (p = 0.022), res pectively . Similarly , results from 
AMB -320 demonstrated that 10 mg and 5 mg po qd of a mbrisentan improved the 
placebo- corrected 6MWD by  51.4 meters (p 0.001) and 30.6 meters (p =0.008), 
respectivel y. 
Time to clinical worsening, an indicator of disease p rogression, was a key  secondary  
endpoint in the two Phase 3, placebo -controlled studies. The individual studies were not 
statistically  powered to examine secondary  endpoints such as time to clinical worsening; 
therefore, to increase the power to observe a treatment effect, a combined anal ysis of the 
twoPhase [ADDRESS_746374] for 
the comparison of the combined ambrisentan group versus placebo demonstrated that a 
significant delay  in the time to cli nical worsening of PAH was observed for subjects 
receiving ambrisentan (p <0.001). Furthermore, the hazard ratio was 0.29 (95% CI : 0.14 to 
0.59), indicating a 71% reduction in the probability of clinical worsening over the 12 -week 
treatment period for subj ects receiving ambrisentan compared to placebo. 
The conclusions of the combined anal ysis were supported by  [CONTACT_569285]. I n AMB -320, a 2 -fold increase in the number of subjects with an event of clinical 
worsening was observed i n the placebo group compared to each of the ambrisentan dose 
groups; however, the log -rank comparison of the combined ambrisentan group versus 
placebo did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the time to clinical 
worsening of PAH (p =0.214). In AMB -321, a 4-fold increase in the number of subjects with 
an event of clinical worsening was observed in the placebo group compared to each of the 
ambrisentan dose groups. The log -rank test demonstrated a significant delay  in time to 
clinical wo rsening of PAH for the comparison of the combined ambrisentan group versus 
placebo (p <0.001). The adjudication and analy sis of clinical worsening events in the Phase 3 
placebo-controlled studies were prespecified; however, during the FDA review of the New
Drug Application (NDA), the agency  performed a separate anal ysis of time to clinical 
worsening that included re -adjudication of some clinical worsening events. Per this analy sis, 
both studies demonstrated a significant improvement in time to clinical wors ening for the 
combined ambrisentan group compared to placebo (AMB -320, p = 0.030; AMB -321, 
p = 0.005), which is consistent with the results of the prespecified integrated anal ysis of the 
2 studies. Therefore, ambrisentan has been indicated in the US to del ay clinical worsening in 
patients with PAH.

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 12 June 2013Clinically  relevant or statistically  significant improvements were observed in the individual 
studies for the secondary  endpoints of WHO functional class, the SF -36™ health survey , and 
Borg d yspnea index (BDI). I n the prespecified combined anal ysis, all secondary  endpoints 
were statisticall y significant. 
In addition, statistically  significant improvements from baseline with ambrisentan treatment 
were observed for several hemody namics parameters (cardiac index, mP AP, and PVR) in a 
Phase 2 dose -controlled study  (AMB -220), consistent with an overall improvement in disease 
state. 
Plasma B -type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a hormone secreted primarily  from the cardiac 
ventricles, has been proposed as a prognostic factor of mortality  in patients with PAH 
[39-41]. Reductions in BNP have been shown to parallel improvements in hemodynamics, 
6MWD, and WHO functional class in patients with PAH [42]. Substantial (p <0.05) and 
clinically  relevant decreases (2 9% to 45%) in BNP compared to placebo were observed in the 
Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], and decreases in BNP correlated with and were predictive of 
improvements in 6MWD.
The long- term follow -up of the subjects who were treated with ambrisentan in the Phase 3, 
placebo-controlled studies and their open-label extension (N = 383) shows a 95% probabilit y 
of survival at 1 year (Kaplan- Meyer anal ysis) and of those with 48 weeks of data, 94% were 
still receiving monotherapy . The improvements in 6MWD, WHO functional cla ss, and BDI 
were maintained for at least 48 weeks with ambrisentan treatment in the Phase 3 studies and 
were generally  maintained for up to 3 years in the Phase 2 study  (AMB -220- E).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Adverse Event Profile
Safety  data for ambrisentan were obtained f rom the two Phase 3, placebo -controlled studies 
and four non- placebo -controlled studies in a total of 483 patients with PAH who were treated 
with doses of 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg qd. As of 30 November 2006, the mean exposure to 
ambrisentan was 79.5 50.28 wee ks (1.5 years) with a range of [ADDRESS_746375] 6 months (418, 86.5%). More than 
two-thirds of subjects had drug exposure of at least 1 y ear (343, 71.0%), approximately  
one
-fourth for 2 or more years (120, 24.8%), and 42 (8.7%) subjects had drug exposures of [ADDRESS_746376] frequent AEs experienced b y the placebo group 
were headache (14%), right ventricular failure (12%), peripheral edema (1 1%), dizziness 
(10%), and nausea (9%). The most notable AEs that occurred more often in the subjects 
receiving placebo compared to ambrisentan were right ventricular failure and nausea.
To evaluate the effects of ambrisentan bey ond the disease process that defined the study  
population, placebo -adjusted incidences were calculated for the common AEs from the

Note: This table includes all AEs >3% incidence in combined ambrisentan treatment group and greater than in the placebo 
group with a difference of ≥1% between the ambrisentan and placebo groups.
Peripheral edema is a known class effect of ERAs, and is als o a clinical consequence of PAH 
and worsening PAH [43,44] . In the placebo -controlled studies, there was an increased 
incidence of peripheral edema in subjects treated with doses of 5 or 10 mg ambrisentan 
compared to placebo ( Table 1-1). Most e dema was mild to moderate in severity . Peripheral 
edema was similar in y ounger patients (<65 years) receiving ambrisentan (14%; 29/205) or 
placebo (13%; 13/104), and was greater in elderl y patients (>65 years) receiving ambrisentan 
(29%; 16/56) compared to placebo (4%; 1/28).
Of the AEs shown in 
Table 1-1, only  nasal congestion consistently  display ed trends of 
increasing frequency  with higher dose. However, the majority  of these events were mild, and 
none were considered severe, se rious, or led to premature discontinuation from the study .
AE profiles following long -term ambrisentan therapy  continued to be consistent with that 
observed in the 12 -week, placebo
-controlled studies. In general, ambrisentan is well -tolerated 
and associate d with a manageable safet y profile in subjects with PAH.
To date, postmarketing surveillance of commercial ambrisentan (Letairis) safet y has shown
that the nature and severity of AEs observed with commercial therap y were generall y
consistent with the know n safet yof ambrisentan , or were attributable to concurrent disease 
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-[ADDRESS_746377] been associated with ERA administration include headache, nasophary ngitis, 
flushing, peripheral edema, and nasal congestion [ 43,44] . Other safety  signals associated 
with ERAs include dose-dependent abnormalities in liver function tests (LFTs, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1) [44-46], the potential adverse effects to fetal development 
(Section1.[IP_ADDRESS]), the potential for adverse effects on male fertility  (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2), and 
decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit ( Section1.[IP_ADDRESS]) [33,35,43,47] .
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Elevations in L iver Function Tests
Previous clinical studies with ERA s for the treatment of PAH have demonstrated 
dose-dependent increases in serum aminotransferase concentrations, specifically  alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which may be associated 
with liver injury . The incidenc e of se rum aminotransferases >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_569269] 12% and 14% for 125 mg and 250 mg twice dail y (bid) 
bosentan, respectivel y [44]. LFT abnormalities have led to dose reduction and 
discontinuation of bosentan therap y in a significant number of patients.
Sitaxs entan has also been associated with dose -dependent LFT abnormalities, including 1 
fatal case of acute hepatitis and 1 case of acute hepatitis requiring subsequent liver 
transplantation [48,49] . In the Phase 3 PAH study (STRI DE-1), the incidence of serum 
aminotransferases >3xULN was 0% and 10% after 100 mg and 300 mg qd po dosing of 
sitaxsentan, respectivel y [43]. When results were combined with an extension study  with a 
median exposure of 26 weeks, the incidence increased to 5% and 21% for the 100 mg and 
300mg groups, respectively . This phase of the study  was terminated prematurely  due to 
concerns regarding the risk of possible liver injury [46]. STRIDE -2 was an 18 -week, 
placebo- controlled study  of PAH patients treated with placebo, sitaxsentan (50 mg or 100 mg 
qd), or bosentan (125 mg bid). I n this study , the incidence of serum aminotransferases 
>3xUL N was 6% for placebo, 5% for 50 mg sitaxsentan, 3% for 100 mg sitaxsentan, and 
11% for bosentan [50] . Sitaxsentan was withdrawn from the worldwide market in December 
2010 due to two cases of fatal liver injury  causally related to the drug [51].
LFTs were closely  monitored in all clinical studies with ambrisentan. In the 12 -week 
placebo- controlled studies, the incidence of serum aminotransferase elevations >3xUL N was 
0% for subjects receiving ambrisentan (N = 261), compared to 2.3% for subjects receiving 
placebo (N = 132). For all ambrisentan- treated subjects (N = 483), the 12 -week incidence of 
aminotransferases >3xULN was 0.8% and >8xULN was 0.2%. The 1- year rate of 
aminotransferase elevations >3xUL N with ambrisentan was 2.8% and >8xULN was 0.5%. 
Most aminotransferase events were generally  mild ( 5xUL N), transient, and did not require 
any action. Only 1 case of aminotransferase elevations >3xULN has been acc ompanied b y 
bilirubin elevations >2xULN. The subject had these elevations while being hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569270]. These LFT abnormalities resolved shortly  after resolution of the 
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-[ADDRESS_746378] subsequently  died due to a new event of viral pneumonia and acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078].
Given the literature on aminotransferase abnormalities in subjects with PAH who received 
placebo in controlled studies, the accumulated clinical experience with ambrisentan suggests 
that the incidence of aminotransferase abnormalities was not greater than the background 
incidence expected in subjects with PAH [35,43] .
In an uncontrolled, open label study , 36 subjects with PAH who had previously  discontinued 
either bosentan, sitaxsentan, or both due to aminotransferase elevations >3xULN were 
treated with ambrisentan (AMB- 222). Prior elevations were predominantly  moderate, with 
64%. of the ALT elevations <5xULN; however, [ADDRESS_746379] elevations 
>8xUL N. Eight subjects had been rechallenged with bosentan and/or sitaxsentan and all eight 
had a recurrence of aminotransferase abnormalities that requir ed discontinuation of ERA 
therap y. All subjects had to have normal aminotransferase levels on entry  to this ambrisentan 
study . Twent y five of the 36 subjects were also receiving prostanoid and/or PDE -5 inhibitor 
therap y. Two subjects discontinued earl y (including one of the subjects with a prior 8xUL N 
elevation) for reasons other than elevated aminotransferase levels. Of the remaining [ADDRESS_746380] experienced a mild aminotransferase elevation at 12 weeks on 
ambrisentan 5 mg that resolved with de creas eddosage to 2.5 mg, and that did not recur with 
later dose escalations to 10 mg. With a median follow up of 13 months and with 50% of 
subjects increasing the dose of ambrisentan to 10 mg, no subjects were discontinued for 
aminotransferase elevations.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Potential Risk of Testicular Injury
It is not known if the testicular lesions seen in animals (Section 1.2.2) correspond to an y 
measurable effect in humans. Data from the literature indicates that endothelin re ceptors are 
localized to different cell ty pes in the rat and human testes [52-54], suggesting the potential 
for a different response in man. I n the Phase [ADDRESS_746381] on male reproductive potential.
This clinical study  includes clear informed consent regarding th e potential development of 
testicular injury  and infertility . The ambrisentan IB should be reviewed for additional 
information.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Potential Risk to Fetal Development
Teratogenicity  is a class effect of ERAs ( Section 1.2.2). There are no data on the use of 
ambrisentan in pregnant women. 
Ambrisentan is contraindicated in women who are or may  become pregnant while taking this 
drug. Pregnant women will be excluded from participation in the current study , and female 
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-[ADDRESS_746382] has undergone tubal sterilization or has ha d a Copper T 380A 
intrauterine device (IUD) or LNg 20 IUD inserted, in which case no other contraception is 
needed. In addition, monthly  pregnancy  tests will be required for subjects of childbearing 
potential.
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Hematological Changes
The development of drug -related reductions in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit 
have been associated with ERA administration in subjects with PAH, including ambrisentan, 
and there have been cases where this has resulted in anemia [33,35, 38,43,47] . Reversible 
hemodilution has been proposed as the mechanism of action for this ERA class effect [34]. 
In the placebo -controlled ambrisentan studies, the mean decrease in hemoglobin 
concentration was 0.8 g/dL [38], which was comparable to the decrease observed with 
bosentan treatment (0.9 g/dL ) [44]. Mean hemoglobin concentration decreased over the first 
4weeks for subjects receiving ambri
sentan but stabilized by  412 weeks of treatment. There 
appeared to be no c lear relationship between the decrease in hemoglobin and ambrisentan 
dose. Similar findings were observed for mean hematocrit. 
In the placebo -
controlled studies, marked decreases in hemoglobin ( ≥15% decrease resulting 
in a value below the lower limit of normal) were observed in 7% of subjects receiving 
ambrisentan compared to 4% of subjects receiving placebo. 
No other notable hematology  findings were observed with ambrisentan treatment. The c ause 
of the decrease in hemoglobin is unknown, but it does not appear to result from hemorrhage 
or hemoly sis.

uninterrupted, continued access to ambrisentan, subjects meeting these criteria in c ountries 
where ambrisentan is commercially  available are eligible for enrollment in this study .
This study  provides a mechanism for collecting ongoing safet y data to supplement the 
existing ambrisentan safety  database. The safety  of subjects receiving long -term ambrisentan 
treatment will be monitored with monthly (every  4 weeks) LFT assessments and bi -annual 
(every  24 weeks) Clinic Visits.  The Screening/Enrollment visit for this study  will coincide 
with the final study  visit of the previous ambrisentan study . Baseline will be defined asthe 
time of enrollment in tothis study .
Elevations in serum aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) values may  be detected at the 
Screening/Enrollment visit. Per the treatment guidelines for the review and management of 
elevated serum aminotransferases , which are included in all ambrisentan clinical protocols
(see Section 6.2of this protocol) , subjects with an increase in ALT or AST concentrations 
>8xUL N must immediately  stop ambrisentan treatment. The se subjects may  not re -initiate 
ambrisentan even after serum aminotransferase concentrations have decreased below 3xUL N 
and therefore will not be allowed to enroll in this study . Subjects with ALT/or AST 
concentrations >3xUL N but 8xUL N will be allowed to enroll , and must treated and 
monitored per the guidelines provided in Section 6.2.

>3xUL Nmust be confirmed by  a second test (>3xULN) that is collected no more than 7 day s 
after receipt of the initial lab report . All events of AL T/AST (confirmed and unconfirmed) 
will be included in the assessment of aminotransferase abnormalities >3xULN; however, 
confirmed serum ALT or AST concentration >3xULN m ust also be immediately reported as 
a serious adverse event (SAE).
The requirements pre sented in Table 6-1must be applied to the review and management of

CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 12 June [ZIP_CODE]. ADVERSE EVENTS AND T OXICITY  MANAGEMENT
8.1. Adverse Events
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign, s ymptom, 
or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
AEs may  also include the following:
Pre-or post -treatment complications that occur as a result of a protocol-associated 
procedure (e.g., invasive procedures such as venipuncture, biops y) during or after 
screening (before the administration of study  drug)
Any pre-existing condition that increases in severity  or changes in nature during or as a 
consequence of the study drug phase of this clinical study  
Complication and termination of pregnancy  (see Section 8.7for additional information)
All AEs that occur from the time the subject 
consent s to participate in the study and 
throughout th e duration of the study, including the follow -up off stud y medication period
should be recorded as an AE. For Post -Study  Reporting Requirements, see Section 8.5.3.
An AE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical proce dures (e.g.
,surgery , endoscopy ,tooth extraction, transfusion)
performed; t he condition that leads to the procedure is an AE
Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory  abnormalities present or detected before
the screening visit that donot worsen
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. ,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89783] , social and/or convenience admissions)
Overdose without clinical sequelae; however, all overdoses, as ymptomatic and 
symptomatic, must be reported u sing the overdose form.
Any medical condition or clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  with an onset date 
before the screening visit and not related to a protocol-associated procedure is not an AE. It 
is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the M edical History  CRF.
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing conditions that do not represent a 
clinically  significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. Any  
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-0124 Version 2.0
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 12 June 2013pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms not related to P H or underly ing etiology  
present in a subject prior to the start of the study  should be recorded on the Medical History  
CRF.
8.2. Assessment of Adverse Events
All AEs will be assessed by  [CONTACT_566968]. The AE 
entry should indicate whether or not the AE was serious, the start date (AE onset), the stop 
date (date of AE resolution), whether or not the AE was related to study  drug , or to a study  
procedure, the action taken with study  drug due to the AE, the severity of the AE, and the 
outcome of the AE. 
AEs alread y documented in the CRF (i.e., at a previous assessment) and designated as 
“ongoing” should be reviewed at subsequent visits as necessary . Upon resolution, the date 
and time (if applicable) of resolution sh ould be recorded in the CRF. If an AE increases in 
frequency  or severit y during a stud y period, a new record of the event should be started.
AEs should be documented in terms of a medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the 
AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or sy mptoms observed b y the Investigator or 
reported b y the subject at each stud y visit.
For AEs associated with laboratory  abnormalities, the AE should be assessed on the basis of 
the clinical severit y in the context of the underl yingconditions. Collection of changes in 
laboratory  values as AEs should be restricted to those considered clinicall y significant b y the 
Investigator that result in a change, interruption, or discontinuation of study  drug, are 
considered an SAE, or require me dical intervention or treatment. Laboratory  values 
associated with clinical signs and s ymptoms should be reported as an AE based on the 
clinical signs and s ymptoms not as the laboratory  value.
8.2.1. Assessment of Causality
The relationship to study  drug (ambrise ntan/placebo) therapy  should be assessed using 
clinical judgment and the following definitions:
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology  other than the 
study  drug. For SAEs, an 
alternative causality  must be provided (e.g., pre -existing condition, un derlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes: A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration of the study 
drug that cannot be readily  explained by  [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Fur thermore, the AE appears with some degree of certaint y to be related, based 
on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions or AE profile of the study  drug. In 
case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon 
rechallenge.
Ambrisentan
Protocol GS -US-300-0124 Version 2.0
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 12 June 2013It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y 
related in the context of AE reporting. 
The relationship to study  procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as venipuncture) should 
be assessed using the following definitions:
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology  other than the study  procedure.
Yes: The AE occurred as a result of protocol -mandated procedures such as venipuncture.
8.2.2. Assessment of Intensity
Adverse events will be graded on a 3 -point sc ale, and reported as indicated on the CRF. 
Maximum intensity  should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:
Mild :The AE does not interfere with routine activities. The subject may  experience slight 
discomfort.
Moderate :The AE interferes with routin e activities. The subject may  experience significant 
discomfort.
Severe :The AE makes it impossible to perform routine activities. The subject may  
experience intolerable discomfort or pain.
8.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as follows: 
Any adverse drug experience occurring at any  dose that results in any  of the following 
outcomes: 
Death
Life-threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death)
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (ex cluding those for 
study  therapy  or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other SAEs )
Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y
Congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study  drug
Other: medicall y significant events that may  not be immediately  life-threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above

Protocol GS -US-300-0124 Version 2.0
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 1.0 ROW
CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 12 June 2013Examples of such events are as follows:
—Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
—Blood d yscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
—Development of drug dependency  or drug a buse
—Infections resulting from contaminated [COMPANY_009] medicinal product
Study  specific:
Pregnancies ( Section 8.7)
Elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations (
Section 6.2)
Clarification of Serious A dverse Events
Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AEin itself. In reports of death due to “Disease 
Progression,” where no other information is provided, the death will be assumed to have 
resulted from progression of the disease being treated with the study  drug(s).
“Occurring at an y dose” does not imply  that the subject is receiving study  drug at the 
time of the event. Dosing may  have been given as treatment cy cles or interrupted 
temporaril y before the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.
“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had 
occurred with greater severity .
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343359]. If a complication prolongs the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is a SAE.
“In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally  admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99325], for an y length of time. This may  or may  not be overnight. It does not 
include presentation and care within an emergency  department.
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.
A distinction should be drawn between seriousness and severit y of AEs. An AE that is 
assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severit y is a category utilized for 
rating the intensit y of an e vent; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event 
is defined as "serious" when it meets one of the predefined outcomes described above .

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) in line with relevant legislation, 
including the European Commission Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC) to worldwide 
regulatory  authorities; therefore, [COMPANY_009] (or the Clinical Research Organization [ CRO] on the 
behalf of [COMPANY_009]) must be notified immediately  regarding the occurrence of any  SAE that
occurs after the subject consents to participate in the study , including SAEs resulting from 
protocol -associated procedures as defined in relevant legislation including 2001/20/EC, 
performed from screening onwards. The procedures for reporting all SAEs, r egardless of 
causal relationship, are as follows:
Record the SAE on the AE CRF and complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form. 
Faxor e-mail the SAE form to the attention of designated Pharmacovigilance Officer
within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. For fatal or life -threatening 
events, also fax copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy  reports, and other documents 
when requested and applicable. 
[COMPANY_009] may  request additional information from the Investigator to ensure the timely  
completion of accurate safet y reports. Any subject data sent to [COMPANY_009] must be made 
anony mous (while remaining traceable by  [CONTACT_569291]) before sending .
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary  for resolution of the SAE. Any  
medications necessary  for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the CONMED
Section of the subject’s CRF.
Follow -up of AEs/SAEs will continue through the last day  on study  and/or until the

8.6. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities are usuall y not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory  
abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry , hematology, urinaly sis) independent of the underl ying 
medical condition that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to study  drug 
interruption or discontinuation must be re corded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable . 
In addition, laboratory  or other abnormal assessments (e.g., vital signs) that are associated 
with signs and/or s ymptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they  meet the definition of 
an AE (or SAE) as de scribed in Section 8.1(or 8.3). If the laboratory  abnormality  is part of a 
syndrome, record the s yndrome or diagnosis.
If the changes are mild and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_569272], the 
Investigator should continue to carefull y monitor the values. Laboratory tests may be

dose adjustment and monitoring of subjects who devel op serum aminotransferase elevations. 
Investigators are required to follow these guidelines. All confirmed elevations in serum 
aminotransferase concentrations >3xUL N must be imme diately  reported as a SAE.
8.7. Pregnancy
Subjects who become pregnant during the s tudy must discontinue study  drug immediatel y, 
and the pregnancy  must be reported as an SAE. The Investigator should report all 
pregnancies to the designated Pharmacovigilance Officer within [ADDRESS_746406] regarding the possible effects 
of prior study  drug exposure on the fetus (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 and the IB) a nd the need to 
inform the study  site of the outcome of the pregnancy . The SAE r eporting process, as 
identified in Section 8.5must be followed.
Subjects should be instructed to notify  the Investigator if they  become pregnant at an y time 
during the stud y, or if they become pregnant within [ADDRESS_746407] should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy. Th e outcome should be 
reported to the designated Pharmacovigilance Officer ( Section 8.5) using the Pregnancy  
Outcome Report form . If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study  has been completed, 
the outcome should be reported directl y to [COMPANY_009] DSPH. [COMPANY_009] DS PH contact [CONTACT_569295]: Email: and Fax:

Appropriate medical documentation of prior complete bilateral oophorectomy  (i.e., 
surgical removal of the ovaries , resulting in “surgical menopause” and occurring at the 
age at which the procedure was performed) or
Permanent cessation of previously  occurring menses as a result of ovarian failure with 
documentation of hormonal deficiency  by a certified healthcare provider (i.e., 
“spontaneous menopause,” which occurs in the [LOCATION_002] at a mean age of 
51.5 years).
A hormonal deficiency  should be properl y documented in the case of suspected 
spontaneous menopause as follows:
If age 54 years and with the absence of normal menses: serum follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level elevated to within the post- menopausal range based on the 
laboratory  reference range where the hormonal assay  is performed;
If age <54 years and with the absence of normal menses: negative serum or urine human 
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) with concurrently  elevated serum FSH level in the post -
menopausal range, depressed estradiol (E 2) level in the post - menopausal range, and 
absent serum progesterone level, based on the laboratory  reference ranges wh ere the 
hormonal assay s are performed.
Female subjects who were determined to be post -menopausal (i.e., not of childbearing 
potential) at the time enrollment in the previous ambrisentan study  will be considered post-
menopausal for this study. Female subjec ts who were of childbearing potential at the time of 
enrollment in the previous study must meet the criteria outlined above in order to be 
considered post -menopausal.

10.1. Investigator Responsibilit ies
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice
The Investigator will ensure that this study  is conducted in accordance with the principles of 
the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and 
South Africa), International Conference on Harmo nisation (I CH) guidelines, or with the laws 
and regulations of the country  in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the 
greater protection to the study  subject. 
[COMPANY_009] and Investigators will follow requirements as set forth in the U.S. Code o f Federal 
Regulations, 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 312 and the I CH E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
Consolidated Guidance (ICH 1996). Investigator responsibilities are set out in Section 4 of 
the E6 Guideline (as published in the Federal Register May  1997) . Sponsor responsibilities 
are set out in Section 5 of the E6 I CH Guideline (as published in the Federal Register May  
1997).
Since this is a “covered” clinical trial, the Investigator will ensure that 21 CFR Part 54, 1998, 
is adhered to; a “covered” clinic al trial is an y “study of a drug or device in humans submitted 
in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or 
FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show 
equivale nce to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the 
demonstration of safet y.” This requires that Investigators and all sub- investigators must 
provide documentation of their financial interest or arrangements with [COMPANY_009], or propriet ary 
interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before participation 
of the Investigator and any  sub-investigator. The Investigator and sub- investigator agree to 
notify  [COMPANY_009] of an y change in reportable interests during the study  and for one y ear 
following completion of the study . Study  completion is defined as the date that the last 
subject has completed the protocol defined activities.
This study  is also subject to and will be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR Part 320, 
1993, “Retention of Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”

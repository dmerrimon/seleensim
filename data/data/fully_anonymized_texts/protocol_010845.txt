Primary Objective  To validate the use of wearable sensors for capturing 
responses to losses of balance (LOBs).  During laboratory 
testing, w e will use both wearable sensors and a laboratory-
based optoelectronic motion c apture system to measure 
responses to LOBs after laboratory- induced trips  and slips .  
During real -world testing, we will use wearable sensors to 
measure responses to LOBs after any naturally -occur ring 
trips or slips  during the real -world daily lives of par ticipants.  
Participants for this primary objective are referred to as 
"non -balance training participants."  
Secondary 
Objective(s)  Responses to LOB measured during both laboratory testing 
and real -world testing will be used to compare between three 
types  of balance training. Participants for this secondary 
objective are referred to as "balance training participants."  
Study Population  Adults age 65-80 
Sample Size  60 total including 30 non-balance training participants and 
30 balance training participants .   
Research 
Intervention(s)/ Investigational Agent(s)  Data will be obtained using 1) a laboratory -based 
optoelectronic motion capture system  to measure responses 
to LOBs (i.e. body movements ) after  laboratory -induced 
trips and slips, 2) wearable sensors  to measure responses to 
LOBs after laboratory -induced and any naturally -occurring 
real-world trips and  slips , 3) a wearable voice recorder  to 
describe any real -world trips  or slips . 
 
For balance training participants , each participants will 
complete one of three different research interventions:  non-
treadmill training (NT); treadmill training (TT); or  strength 
training (ST) .  All interventions will be  performed two times

2.0 Objectives  
2.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives  of this study : 
 
The primary objective is to validate the use of wearable sensors for capturing responses to losses of balance (LOBs).  During laboratory testing, we will use wearable sensors and a laboratory- based optoelectronic motion capture system t o simultaneously 
measure responses to LOBs after  laboratory- induced trips and slips.  During real -world 
testing, we will use wearable sensors to measure responses to LOBs after any naturally -
occurring trips or slips during the real -world daily lives of participants.  
The secondary objective of this study is to compare the effects of three balance training 
exercises on responses to LOBs measured in the laboratory and in the real -world during 
daily life.   
 
2.2 State the hypotheses to be tested :  
 
Hypotheses for our primary objective  that will involve non -balance training participants : 
 Hypothesis 1: LOB response measures obtained from the wearable sensors  after lab -
induced trips and slips will exhibit statistical agreement with the same measures obtained simultaneously from a laborat ory-based optoelectronic motion capture system. 
 Hypothesis 2: Real -world LOB responses will show greater variety than laboratory-
induced LOB responses.  
Hypotheses for our secondary objective  that will involve balance training participants : 
 Hypothesis 3: N T and TT  participants will exhibit improved LOB  responses after lab -
induced trips and slips compared to ST  participants.  
Hypothesis 4: NT and TT participants will exhibit statistically -equivalent LOB  
responses after lab -induced trips  and slips . 
Hypothesis 5: NT and TT participants will exhibit improved LOB responses after any 
naturally -occurring real -world trips  and slips . 
 
3.0 Background  
3.1 Summarize the relevant prior research on  this topic and gaps in current 
knowledge within the field of study : 
 
21-1072  Validation and application of wearable sensors for capturing responses to losses 
of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 6 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  Falls are the leading cause of injuries among older adults. An estimated 60% of falls 
among community- dwelling  older adults are due to LOBs induced by [CONTACT_717451][INVESTIGATOR_717431] 
[Berg 1997] . Laboratory studies have shown that these falls generally result from an age-
related decline in balance recovery ability after an LOB [ Pavel 2007; van Dieen 2005]. 
However, technical  challenges with capturin g the kinematics of these events outside the 
lab has resulted in at least two knowledge gaps that limit progress in fall prevention 
research. F irst, there is a need to validate the use of wearable sensors (that can be used 
outside the lab in the real -world ) by [CONTACT_717452] a gold- standard 
laboratory system.  Second, it is unclear if gait and t rippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/slippi[INVESTIGATOR_717432] -world. Laboratory trips and slips are  
contrived, highly- controlled, and often not unexpected, and likely result in more 
stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_717433].  Real -world trips and slips are typi[INVESTIGATOR_717434], have 
more variable etiology and environmental  contributions, and as a result likely elicit more 
variable LOB responses.  Acco rdingly, there is a critical need to evaluate the use of 
wearable sensors to capture responses to LOBs both in the laboratory and in the real -
world. 
 Multiple studies report a reduction in real -world fall risk after perturbation -balance 
training (PBT)  [Rosenblatt 2013; Grabiner 2012; Bhatt 2012] .  These studies  speculate 
that this reduction in fall risk is due to improved responses to LOBs . An LOB is defined 
as an event when the postural control of the body that resists gravity (balance) is 
momentarily lost, and is then followed by [CONTACT_717453] a fall, or a fall.   To our knowledge, no studies have shown a direct training effect of 
PBT on responses to real -world LOBs. Until a real -world effect is demonstrated, PBT 
studies reporting a reduction in falls may be confounded by [CONTACT_717454], safe/risky behavior, and the daily living environment rather than true PBT -induced improvements in balance.  
Accordingly, evaluating responses to real -world LOBs and their context (i.e. the 
circumstances surrounding the LOB) are critical in evaluating the effectiveness of PBT. Prior studies have been limited to participant recall to obtain information on fall context despi[INVESTIGATOR_91184] -documented inaccuracies in sel f-reporting [ Perry 2012; Zecevic 2006] . 
Rather, we propose to track body movements during responses to real -world LOBs and 
their context using wearable sensors and voice recorders .  
The study proposed in this IRB application will compare two types of PBT ( NT and 
TT) to an alternative training (ST) among adults age 65- 80.  This study may link 
training -induced improvements to improvements in real -world LOB responses, a truly 
novel and innovative link that has previously not been possible.

3.3 Based on the existing literature, provide the scientific or scholarly rationale for and significance of your research and how will it add to existing knowledge : 
 
This study will address two major knowledge gaps in the literature.   
First, there is a need to validate the use of wearable sensors (that can be used to capture 
responses to LOBs in the real -world) to measure responses to LOBs with simultaneous 
measures obtained from gold- standard laborat ory-based equipment.   
Second , PBT studies aiming to reduce the risk falls have almost exclusively used 
specialized treadmills to apply perturbations during training.  While this type of training has shown beneficial effects on responses to laboratory- induced LOBs , the cost of these 
specialized treadmills may present a barrier to widespread adoption of this training by [CONTACT_717455].  This study will evaluate an alternative PBT not requiring a specialized treadmill that would allevia te cost as a barrier to its use, and 
measure the effects of this training on responses to LOBs after both laboratory- induced 
trips and slips, and naturally- occurring trips and slips.

behavioral, or educational research. See link below for a discussion.

Study endpoints for all participants will include:  
1) measurements of body movements during responses to LOBs  after lab -induced 
trips and slips  
2) two or three weeks of using wearable sensors to measure body movements during responses to LOBs after naturally- occurring trips  and slips  during daily life  
3) during the two or three  weeks of using wearable sensors, participant s will also 
use a digital voice recorder t o record a description of the context of each real -
world LOB . Specifically, participants will be asked to make a short recording 
21-1072  Validation and application of wearable sensors for capturing responses to losses 
of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 9 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  after each LOB to describe (1) what they were doing at the time (e.g., “I was 
walking across my living room”), (2) how they los t their balance (e.g., “I tripped 
over my dog”), (3) why they lost their balance (e.g., “my dog ran in front of me to bark at the mailman”), and (4) the results of LOB (e.g., “I fell, or did not fall, as a result”).   
 
4.2 Describe any primary or secondary sa fety endpoints. These should be 
included for all studies that are greater  than minimal risk . (Minimal risk: 
The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research that are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.) : 
 
No safety endpoint  is included while using wearable sensors in the real -world during 
daily life because the use of the wearable sensors does not increase risk above that 
normally experienced during every day life.  
 During balance training (among balance training participant s), safety endpoints will 
include number of times the spotter is needed to provide support to the participant during training, and the number of times the participant is fully supported by [CONTACT_717456] -induced LOBs.  
  
 
 
5.0 Study Design and Statistical Analysis Plan  
5.1 Describe the basic study design/approach (e.g., qualitative study using five 
focus groups of first year students to describe assimilation into the university community;  randomized controlled trial of a be havioral change 
intervention to increase  dietary  intake of whole grains ; pre- post -test 
evaluation of new pedagogical techniques to improve adult literacy) : 
 
For our primary objective, a one -group repeated -measures design will be used to validate 
the use of wearable sensors to capture responses to LOBs.  Subjects will use w earable 
sensors for three weeks to capture responses to naturally- occurring trips and slips during 
daily life.  Subjects will th en complete a laboratory session to captur e lab-induced LOB 
responses simultaneously from the wearable sensors and a gold- standard optoelectronic 
motion capture system.    For our secondary objective, a  three-group posttest -only design will be used t o compare 
the effects of three balance training exercises on  responses to LOBs after laboratory-
induced trips and slips , and two weeks of naturally -occurring real -world trips  and slips .  
Subjects will first complete three weeks of their assigned training.  Subje cts will then

will then use wearable sensors for t wo weeks to capture responses to naturally -occurring 
trips and slips during daily life. 
 
 
5.2 Describe corresponding data analysis plan/approach (e.g., content analysis of focus group transcripts ; descriptive analysis followed by [CONTACT_40190];  nonparametric analysis of pre - and post -test 
measures) :
 
 
Hypothesis 1: LOB response measures obtained from the wearable sensors  after lab -
induced trips and slips will exhibit statistical agree ment with the same measures 
simultaneously obtained from a gold- standard laboratory- based motion capture system. 
  
To address Hypothesis 1, a  Bland -Altman analysis will be used to  evaluate level of 
agreement between the two systems. This approach will reveal any measurement bias  
between the two systems, and provide bounds for these differences.  
 Hypothesis 2: Real -world LOB responses will show greater variety than laboratory-
induced LOB responses.  To address Hypothesis 2, a repeated -measures ANOVA (wit h a random effect for 
subject) will first be  used to compare means of key kinematic measures of LOB 
responses between environments (real -world vs  lab). Second, we will compare statistical 
variability by [CONTACT_717457] -world and lab environments 
using hypothesis testing (essentially Levene’s test) and interval estimation to quantify potential  differences in variability.  
 Hypothesis 3: N T and TT  participants will exhibit improved LOB  responses after lab -
induced trips and slips comp ared to ST  participants.   
 To address H ypothesis  3, response variables will be compared between NT , TT, and ST  
participants using a one -way ANOVA with group as the independent variable and 
covariates included as needed. A significant effect of group will be followed by [CONTACT_447] -hoc 
analysis using Dunnett’s test to determine whether NT, TT, or both differ from ST .  
 Hypothesis 4: NT and TT participants will exhibit statistically -equivalent LOB  responses 
after lab -induced trips  and slips . 
 To address Hypothesis 4,  agreement of response variables between NT and TT 
participants will be evaluated using statistical equivalence test.   A comparison between the three balance training exercises on LOB responses after any 
naturally -occurring real -world trips will be done qualitatively and thus not have an 
explicit hypotheses to be tested.

Study Investigational Agents  
 The wearable sensors will be commercially -available inertial measurement units 
(https://apdm.com/wearable -sensors/) are the size of a matchbox and are specifically 
designed for wearing to measure body movements.  They come with specialized straps to secure then on the body where desire d.  Three sensors will be worn by [CONTACT_717460], and one sensor on the sternum using a light -weight shoulder harness 
worn under clothes.   
 
The portable voice recorder ( Sansa Clip Zip MP3 player ) is a commercially -available 
device.   
 These sensors are self -contained , do not require any wires for connectivity, and will be 
used in a manner consistent with their approved use.  The laboratory -based equipment used to measure responses to LOBs will be an 
optoelectronic motion capture system.  This system includes 13 cameras and a CPU unit for data collection.  Reflective markers (approximately 1 cm in diameter) are placed on the participant at selec ted anatomical locations to measure body movements and 
responses to LOBs.  
 No microwaves, X -rays, DEXA scans, general anesthesia, or sedation will be used as a 
part of the intervention.  However, DEXA scans will be used as a part of screening participants.

21-1072  Validation and application of wearable sensors for capturing responses to losses 
of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 13 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  To address our s econdary objective , balance training  participant s will be assigned to 
one of t hree balance training exercises/interventions including TT, NT, and ST.  No 
drugs are used in this study.  Each training session for TT, N T, and ST will be one -on-
one with the investigator, approximately 30- 45 minutes in duration, and two sessions 
will be completed each week for three weeks.  A description of each session of each 
type of training follows.  
 
Each TT session will involve  a trip  training protocol with a specialized treadmill 
(Aviles et al., 2019). TT perturbations will be induced while participants are standing on a modified treadmill (Freemotion 800, Freemotion Fitness, Logan, UT). The treadmill belt will then be accelerated pos teriorly, varying in speed from 0.[ADDRESS_978262] naturally and try to establish a stable gait after perturbations and an initial step over an obstacle. The treadmill belt  speed will be maintained until one of two 
conditions are met: (1) participant established a stable gait for several strides, or (2) participant received substantial support from a fall protection harness or spotter(s) standing next to him/her. Based upon the performance of participants, the treadmill speed will progressively be increased during each session to continue challenge participants and to maintain variability over the course of training. Perturbations in the reverse belt direction (i.e., 0.5 mph anteriorly) will also be included intermittently to reduce anticipation. A slender, lightweight rectangular foam block ( 7.5 cm  x 7.5 cm 
cross section) will be placed within [ADDRESS_978263] break after every 10 perturbations.   
 Each NT session will involve four phases of voluntary/volitional steppi[INVESTIGATOR_717436] . Each 
session will begin with a three -minute warm- up of walking on a treadmill and light 
stretching. Phase 1 – Rapid Steppi[INVESTIGATOR_717437] a participant will start to fall forward and then take quick steps to recover balance. This exercise will be performed first without trippi[INVESTIGATOR_717438], and then with a slender, lightweight rectangular foam bloc k (7.5 cm x 7.5 cm cross section) placed

spotter will be nearby [CONTACT_717461].  The investigator will also 
demonstrate each phase before asking the participant  to complete them, and if necessary 
assistance will be provided during initial attempts  by [CONTACT_2299] .  Each NT session 
will be individualized to each participant’s capability and rate of improvement  to 
continuously challenge the participant  while not asking them to overexert themselves .  
 
Each ST session will involve general balance and strength exercises adapted from the 
Otago Exercise Program (Campbell et al., 1997). Otago has shown its effectiveness in reducing fall risk in community- dwelling older adults, and thus it is chosen among m any 
other general exercise interventions to increase the level of evidence for demonstrating efficacy. In addition, similar to NT or TT, it can be performed individually. Each ST session will involve strength and balance exercises with varying ankle weight s or 
difficulty of the balance exercises (e.g., holding onto a wall or no support), which will be progressively increased based upon the performance of participants.  Strength exercises will include controlled squatting, lunges, knee bends, hip extensions, leg side raises, and toe raises.  Resistance will be provided with ankle weights.  Balance exercises will involve standing with feet side -by-side at decreasing distance, standing with one foot in 
front of the other, and standing on one foot.  Difficulty w ill progress by [CONTACT_717462] (e.g. feet side by [CONTACT_717463], one foot in front of the other and increasing the distance between them, and asking subjects to move their body while in these challenging feet positions).  
The progression of difficulty will be based on the investigators perception of the improving ability of the participant.

8.0 Procedures Involved  
8.1 Describe and explain the study design:  
 
For our primary objective, a one -group repeated -measures design will be used to validate 
the use of wearable sensors to capture responses to LOBs.  Non -balance training 
participants  will use wearable sensors for three weeks to capture responses to naturall y-
occurring trips and slips during daily life.  Subjects will then complete a laboratory session to capture lab -induced LOB responses simultaneously from the wearable sensors 
and a gold- standard optoelectronic motion capture system.   
 For our secondary objective, a t hree-group posttest -only design will be used t o compare 
the effects of three balance training exercises on  responses to LOBs after laboratory-
induced trips and slips, and two weeks of naturally- occurring real -world trips and slips .  
Balance training participants  will first complete three weeks of their assigned training.  
Subjects will then complete a laboratory session to capture lab -induced LOB responses 
simultaneously from the wearable sensors and a gold- standard optoelectronic motion 
capture system.  Subjects will then use wearable sensors for two weeks to capture responses to naturally- occurring trips and slips during daily life.

be based on the investigators perception of the improving ability of the participant.    - If the participant is assigned no training, then no such training will be performed.  
- All participants will then complete the two types of LOB response mea surements 
described below.  
 
Measure LOB responses in the laboratory:  
- Each participant  will complete a lab session to assess their response to an LOB after 
lab-induced trips and slips .  This session will take place in our research lab on the VT 
campus (556 Whittemore Hall).  During these sessions , participants will wear a safety 
harness supported overhead to prevent impact with the floor in the event of an 
unsuccessful balance recovery.  First, the appropriate size will be selected from a range of sizes we have in the lab.  Second, the investigator will assist the participant in donning the harness, securing all straps and connections, and inspecting and confirming the overall fit.  The PI (Madigan) has extensive experience with the harnesses, and will trai n 
the student investigators in their use.   - Participants will also wear reflective markers so researchers can measure their 
movements with a laboratory motion capture system.  As we have done for years, these markers will be affixed to clothing and skin at selected anatomical landmarks using double -sided tape.  Youngjae Lee will place markers on participants.  Markers will be 
place bilaterally on the shoes at the toes and heels, ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, and on a headband worn around the head.     - Participants will first complete a minimum of [ADDRESS_978271] at a self -selected  speed. Instructions will be to “walk as if you have somewhere 
to go, and if tripped or slipped, recover your  balance and conti nue walking.” All 
participants will wear the same model of rubber -soled shoes and a safety  harness affixed 
to a ceiling -mounted track that spans the length of the walkway. After initial walking 
trials, trips  and slips will be induced during randomly- selected trials with walking trials 
and rest breaks interspersed.  As in our prior work, trips will be induced using a trippi[INVESTIGATOR_717441]. Upon proper placement of 
the foot relative to the obst acle while walking,  the obstacle will be activated and quickly 
rise and result in a trip shortly after mid -swing. In an effort to add variety to the LOB 
responses, three trip obstacle heights from prior trippi[INVESTIGATOR_717442] 5, 7.5, and [ADDRESS_978272] applied over a 0.9 × 0.[ADDRESS_978273] to induce an  unexpected slip at heel strike during the next trial. In an effort 
to add variety to the LOB responses, three  different contaminants or slippi[INVESTIGATOR_717443], soapy water, and a  carpet mat on a poli shed vinyl floor.   
 Measure naturally -occurring LOB responses in the r eal-world : 
- Participant s will be briefed on how to wear and use the wearable sensors, and the 
investigator will give the sensors to the participant s for them to wear over the subsequent 
three weeks (no balance training participants) or t wo weeks (TT, NT, and ST 
participants) during their daily lives.  Participant s will be asked to wear the sensors for at 
least 10 hours a day.

of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 19 of 45 Revised: March  5, [ADDRESS_978274] like a watch .  
Participant s will be asked, if they experience any kind of loss of balance, to describe to 
the voice recorder 1) what they were doing when they lost their balance (e.g. carrying 
groceries in from the car), why they lost their balance  (e.g. did not see a stick in the 
sidewalk),  and how they responded (e.g. recovered balance by [CONTACT_717467] a 
railing).  - The investigator will telephone the participant  at the end of the first day of sensor use 
and help troubleshoot any issues.  This will also telephone the participant at the end of the third day of sensor use to help troubleshoot any issues.  If necessary, telephone calls will b e made at the end of every day for additional support. 
- After the participant  has worn the sensors for two or three weeks , another meeting will 
be scheduled so the participant  can return the sensors to the investigators.  
 
 
8.3 Describe:  
● Procedures or safeguards intended to reduce the probability and 
magnitude of risks . (For e xample: Reducing the risk of injury in a 
virtual reality study either by [CONTACT_42630] -free space for walking. ) 
● Be sure to describe a ll drugs and devices used in the research, when 
they will be administered or used, and their purpose.  
● Methods used to collect data about subjects. Please upload all data 
collection forms to Protocol Management. Som e common e xamples 
are: 
● Screening questionnaires  
● Survey(s) , including online surveys  
● Demographic questionnaire(s)  
● Interview guide(s) , e.g., questions or pool of questions for semi -
structured interviews  
● Focus group guide(s)  
● Other document s used to collect data  
 
 
Safeguards intended to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes include:  
a) using our medical screening process to exclude individuals at an increased risk of 
adverse outcome during training or laboratory testing;  b) having subjects complete warm -up exercises of walking on a treadmill and stretching 
prior to balance training a nd testing;  
c) the balance training used here was designed to be completed by [CONTACT_67022] 65- 80 years;  
d) the balance training is tailored to each participant's capabilities;  e) rest breaks will be provided as needed by [CONTACT_2299]  
f) the same balance testing methodology employed here has been used in several of our prior studies without adverse outcome;

VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 20 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  g) an investigator and a spotter will be nearby [CONTACT_717468], 
if necessary during balance training; and  
h) participants w ill wear a safety harness to prevent a fall to the floor during balance 
testing. The PI (who has extensive experience using the harnesses) will train the relevant study team member(s) in selecting the proper size safety harness, appropriately tightening 
all safety harness straps and connections, and setting the proper length of the lanyard that 
connects the harness to the overhead support.  The harnesses we will be using are rated 
for individuals up to 310 lb, and we will limit our recruitment to individual s up to 250 lb. 
 No safeguards will be used during the two or three weeks of wearable sensor use since this phase of the study does not involve risk greater than that experienced during daily 
life. 
   All devices used in this study (lab- based motion capture system, wearable sensors , and 
voice recorders)  will be used in the same manner as their approved use.  Also, the use of 
these sensors  does not influence behavior and therefore does not affect risk.  
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_978275] during the study and how you will  obtain them ? 
Please i nclude descriptions of electronic data collection, database 
matching, and app- based data collection:  
 
Participant  anthropometric and demographic information will be collected and recorded 
in a computer file on a password- protected and VT -managed computer.  In this file, 
participant s will only be identified by a numeric code, and not personally- identifiable 
informatio n will be recorded.  
Data collected during the laboratory testing session will include body motion during trip and slip LOB responses  obtained simultaneously from two systems .  The first 
system is the wearable sensors  (https://apdm.com/wearable -sensors/)  with individual 
sensors worn on each foot and one on the sternum using a shoulder strap under the clothing.  The second system is the lab -based opt oelectronic motion capture system 
(Qualisys, Inc) and reflective markers  (small balls approximately 1 cm in diameter) 
placed at specific locations on the body.  Data from these systems  will be recorded as a 
computer file on a password- protected and VT -managed computer.  In these files, 
participant s will only be identified by a  numeric code, and not personally- identifiable 
information will be recorded. 
Video recordings and photographs of participant s during perturbations will be obtained to 
assist with data analysis and for possible use in presentations.  Participant s will need to 
provide permission, on the Informed Consent Form , for us to use these in presentations.  
These videos and photos will be kept on a password- protected and VT -managed 
computer.  
Data from the wearable sensors during real -world LOB response tracking will be  
automatically stored onboard the sensors themselves until downloaded by [CONTACT_1758]

describe the debriefing process, and describe how the study meets all  the 
following criteria  for  alteration of consent  (deception is considered an 
alteration of informed consent) : 
• The research involves no more th an minimal risk to the subjects  
• The alteration will not adversely affect the rights  and welfare of the 
subjects  
• The research could not practicably be car ried out without the 
alteration /deception  
• (Optional  but encouraged in most cases ) Subjects will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation (i.e., debriefing f or 
studies involving deception)   
  Incomplete disclosure will be used in that we will not describe some details of parts of the laboratory session  for balance testing .  In particular, we will not 
disclose 1) whether participants will be slipped or tripped; 2) when during their multiple walk s along our laboratory walkway they will be slipped or tripped; and 
3) exactly how we will cause them to slip or trip.  
 
 This is necessary so that our testing involves unexpected slips and trips.  
  At the end of the laboratory session that involves exposi ng participants to slippi[INVESTIGATOR_717444], we will provide a debriefing by [CONTACT_717469].

of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 28 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  Employees of Virginia Tech may be included.  If so, it will be emphasized that their 
participation is entirely voluntary .   
 
No other vulnerable populations listed above will be included.  
 
 
 14.0 Number of Subjects  
14.1 Indicate the total number of subjects to be enrolled and how this number 
was determined (e.g., sample size calculation [show], number of available subjects in a finite pool, number of tests funding award would allow) :  
 
60 participant s will be enrolled.  This number is based upon a formal sample size 
analysis  described here:  
[ADDRESS_978285] sizes could be determined.  Rather, we estimated 30 participants for this objective to  be a reasonable number based upon 
our available resources and the number of expected LOBs estimated from prior work [Handelzalts et al. 2020].  
30 balance training participants will be recruited for our secondary objective  and be 
based upon Hypothesis 3 : NT and TT participant s will exhibit improved LOB responses 
after lab -induced trips and slips compared to ST  participant s.   
 The sample size was determined using data from lab -induced trips among community-
dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older (Pavol  et al., 2001). The effect size index 
(i.e., Cohen’s 𝑑𝑑 = 1.45) was determined using the difference in mean trunk angle  from 
vertical at the time of  recovery foot ground contact [CONTACT_717472] -fallers 
(17.4°) and the combined standard deviation (12°). The difference in means was considered the minimal clinically important difference based on the anchor -based method 
(Rai et al., 2015). Using G*Power (Faul et al., 2007) for an independent t -test with 80% 
power and a one -sided Type I error (or alpha) of 5%, a sample size of seven participants 
per group is needed. In an effort to be conservative and account for any participants 
withdrawing from the study, 10 participants per balance training group (TT,NT,ST) will 
be recruited.

intervention) : 
 
N/A 
 
16.3 Describe procedures that you will follow  when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection (e.g., participant declines to continue with regular blood draws, but continues with periodic behavioral questionnaires) : 
 
All sessions and data collections will be terminated when a participant withdraws from the study.  Partial withdraw will not be accommodated , meaning that participants 
cannot withdraw from some of the procedures but remain involved in others .   
 
 
17.[ADDRESS_978288] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or 
inconveniences to the subjects related the subjects’ participation in the research. Include for the IRB’s consideration a description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and re versibility of the risks. Consider 
physical, psychological, social, legal, privacy, and economic risks. Do not indicate  “No risk” or “N /A.” Instead, for studies with very low risk (e.g., 
anonymous online questionnaire on a mundane topic) indicate  “The 
investigators are not aware of any risks from participation in this study.” or “No more than risks than are found in everyday life.”  The example 
consent form presents a tabular method for risk information , which you 
can also use here . Common risk types include : 
● Physical (e.g., potential for pain, discomfort, infection)  
● Psychological (e.g., potential for stress, discomfort, and/or embarrassment)  
● Social (e.g., potential for discrimination or stigmatization and disruption of personal and family relationships)  
● Legal (e.g., potential for disclosure of illegal activity, negligence)  
● Privacy (e.g., potential for personal information being accessed, used, or disclosed without the subjects’ knowledge or consent, breach of confidentiality/security)  
● Economic (e.g., potential for individuals to lose access to economic services, employment, insurability)  
 
21-1072  Validation and application of wearable sensors for capturing responses to losses 
of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 32 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  There are potential risks for participant s in the proposed work.  
1. During a DEXA scan, participants will be exposed radiation.  The amount of radiation 
is less than 2 days' exposure to natural background radiation (NBR). By [CONTACT_2163], a chest X -ray uses the equivalent of about 3 days' exposure to NBR, and a flight fro m [LOCATION_006] 
to [LOCATION_003] is equivalent to approximately a week's exposure to NBR  
(

scan/#:~:tex t=The%20amount%20of%20radiation%20used,a%20week's%20exposure%2
0to%20NBR  ). 
 2. During balance training or testing, there is a risk of  muscle strains, joint strains, other 
soft tissue injury, or broken bones.  The risk of these outcomes is considered low gi ven 
our safety measures described in 17.2.  3. During balance training or testing, there is a risk of participants overexerting themselves.  This risk is considered low given our safety measures described in 17.2.  4. During balance testing, the physical r isk of skin irritation and bacterial exposure 
related to the reflective markers, lab -provided rubber soled shoes and clothing, as well as 
the safety harness , are very low  (but not zero) .  We are not aware of a single incident of 
this in the PI's  [ADDRESS_978289], stolen, or damaged during the course of the research, participants will not be held financially responsible for their replacement . 
 
 
17.2  Indicate the measures you will use to minimize risks and monitor subjects for safety. (e.g., asking a subject at regular intervals to rate how they are feeling from 1 to 10, or to slowly crouch in order to check their balance.)  
 
To minimize the risks de scribed above in 17.1, the following safety measures will be 
used:  
 a) using our medical screening process to exclude individuals at an increased risk of injury;   
21-1072  Validation and application of wearable sensors for capturing responses to losses 
of balance  
VT Research Protocol version 1.0. 1 Page 33 of 45 Revised: March  5, 2019  b) having subjects complete warm -up exercises prior to balance training and testing 
includi ng walking on a treadmill and stretching;  
 
c) the balance training used here was designed to be completed by [CONTACT_67022] 65- 80 years;  
 
d) the balance training is tailored to each participant's capabilities;  
 
e) rest breaks will be provided as needed by [CONTACT_2299]  
 f) the same balance testing methodology employed here has been used in several of our 
prior studies without adverse outc ome;  
 g) an investigator and a spotter will be nearby [CONTACT_717468], if necessary during balance training; and  
 h) participants will wear a safety harness to prevent a fall to the floor during balance testing.  The PI (who has  extensive experience using the harnesses) will train the relevant 
study team member(s) in selecting the proper size safety harness, appropriately tightening all safety harness straps and connections, and setting the proper length of the lanyard that conne cts the harness to the overhead support.  The harnesses we will be using are rated 
for individuals up to 310 lb, and we will limit our recruitment to individuals up to 250 lb.  i) several measures will be taken to minimize the risk of skin irritation or ba cterial 
exposure related to the reflective markers, lab -provided rubber soled shoes and clothing, 
as well as the safety harness, are very low (but not zero).   These measures will include: a) 
using disinfecting wipes after each participant's testing, b) rem oval of adhesive material 
after each participant's testing, and c) using tape specifically designed to use on human skin.  j) to minimize the exposure to radiation during DEXA scans, we will only use qualified study personnel  to perform the scanning, and inform participants of the radiation 
exposure prior to scanning.

20.2 Describe steps that you will take  to make subjects feel at ease with the 
research situation in terms of the questions being asked and the procedures being performed. “At ease” does not refer to physical discomfort, but the sense of intrusiveness a subject might experience in response to questions, examinations, and procedures (e.g., use of a same gender investigator to place sensors on the torso , a private changing area 
if clothing must be changed, sensitivity when discussing  pregnancy test ing 
with subjects , making it clear on surveys tha t participants  can discontinue 
at any time, not asking questions about private or sensitive issues unless necessary for the research ): 
 
We will make it clear that participant s can discontinue their participation without 
penalty. We will ask participant s how they are doing and feeling throughout testing, 
and give plenty of encouragement.  We will keep them well -informed throughout each 
session so they are aware of what is going on and what to expect.  
When possible, s ensors will be fit and applied by a member of the study team that is the 
same sex  as the participant.  
We will also develop an illustrated step -by-step instructional packet on the wearable 
sensors usage for participan ts to use at home.  
 
20.3 Describe how you plan to access existing sources of information about the subjects (e.g., medical records, grades) and how you will protect participant privacy through the data security plan:  
 
If a participant opts to use the results of a DEXA scan they had within the last 12 months, rather than having a new scan performed for this study, will be asked to obtain a copy of this prior scan from their physician.  
 
20.4 Describe any required reporting that might  occur as a result of your 
research questions, study populations, and data collection methods. Examples for Virginia and Virginia Tech include:  
• Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40179] (e.g., circumstantial, disclosed) of child abuse (physical, 
emotional, sexual ) and neglect  
• Sexual discrimination and/or sexual violence that involves a student

and/or plan)  
• Disclosure or signs of  desire to harm others (i.e., homicidal ideation 
and/or plan)  
• Suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable adults (e.g., 
individuals with a disability, elderly persons ) 
  
N/A 
  
 
21.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Safety monitoring is required  when research involves greater than m inimal r isk 
and is sometimes appropriate for other studies . 
21.1 Describe:  
● The plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe  (e.g., periodic reporting to the IRB , establishing a data monitoring 
committee , reporting data monitoring committee findings t o the IRB 
and the sponsor ). 
● What data you will review, including safety data, unexpected  events, 
and data that show the ability to produce the intended results . 
● How the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report forms, at study visits, by  [CONTACT_40225] ). 
● The frequency of data collection, including when safety data collection starts.  
● Who will review the safety data and with what frequency . 
● The statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is occurring. 
● Any conditions that will trigger an immediate suspension of the 
research (e.g., a serious adverse event).  
 
 The only potential safety -related concerns will occur during the experimental sessions 
and balance training sessions with the participant s.  We will use the strategies described 
above to minimize these risks, and keep in constant communication with the par ticipant 
during experimental sessions regarding testing protocol and any potential risk.

● The time  interval between  sharing the consent information with the 
prospective subject and obtaining consent . For lab, interview, and 
focus group studies, t he Virginia Tech IRB prefers that subjects have 
at least 24 hours to review the consent form and study information 
before the appointment  where consent will be obtained. For simple 
online survey studies, you can typi[INVESTIGATOR_42615].  
● If applicable, process es to ensure ongoing consent or assent (e.g.,

o Steps that you will take  to minimize the possibility  of coercion 
or undue influence  
o Steps that you will take  to gauge or ensure the subjects’ 
understanding 
 
Upon contact[CONTACT_346189], the study protocol will be explained to participant s via 
telephone. This will allow participant s to ask questions pertaining to the study.  During 
this telephone conversation, we will ensure comprehension by [CONTACT_717476]'ve sa id about the study.  We will also ask for verbal consent 
from all participants to continue with the protocol, and document this verbal consent on the consent form.  
 Participants will then be screened using the 4 -phase process described elsewhere in this 
application.  If/when the participant passes this screening process, they will be provided 
the informed consent form (via email or physical mail) , and a date and time for their first 
session will be scheduled.  Participants will be provided at least [ADDRESS_978300] either prior to their DEXA scan (if they are required to complete one because they do not have one over the last year) or at the start of the first session  (if no new DEXA is required) . Either way, and upon arrival to meeting location , 
the participant  will be given a paper copy of the informed consent to look over and will 
be asked if they have any questions about the form prior to signing. As much time as necessary will be dedicated to the consent process. We will make sure participants  
understand the ir participation is entirely voluntary. We will ensure participants 
understand throughout the consent process by [CONTACT_717477]- speaking adults, asking 
them if they have any questions, and if they understand the consent form.  
 Youngjae Lee  will be obt aining cons ent from participants .  
 
Because our procedures involve several visits to the lab for some participations, we will 
ask subjects weekly how they are doing with the study and procedures, and answer any questions they might have.  If necessary, we will remind them that their participation is 
entirely voluntary.

● Describe the process for obtaining parental permission.  o Permission from o ne parent  is acceptable for  studies  that 
involve no greater than minimal risk OR involve greate r than 
minimal risk but present  the prospect of direct benefit to the 
minor  subject . 
o Permission from both parents is required in all other cases ( unless one parent is deceased, unknown, 
incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the minor ).

than parents or Legally Authorized Representatives , and if so, who 
will be allowed to provide permission. Describe the process you will 
use to determine these individuals’ authority to consent to the  
minor’s general medical care.  
● Indicate whether you will obtain assent from all, some, or none of the minor s. If you will obtain assent from some minors, indicate 
which minors will be required to assent. Consider  chronological age 
and intellectual capacity  when determining who will be required to 
provide assent (e.g., infants are unable to assent. However, teenagers are likely able to read and sign an assent form ). 
● When assent of minors is obtained, describe whether and how you will document  it.  Will minors  sign an assent form or give verbal 
assent? 
● Attach parental permission and minor assent forms or scripts i n

Adults  Unable to Consent  
● Describe the process you will use to determine whether an individual adult is capable of consent. 
● List the individuals from whom  you will obtain permission in order 
of priority (e.g., durable power of attorney for health care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, and non-minor child). o For research conducted in the Virginia , review “SOP: Legally 
Authorized Representatives, Mi nors, and Guardians (HRP -

25.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
25.1 Consult “SOP: Written Documentation of Consent (HRP -091)” for 
recommended procedures , and describe whether and how consent of the 
subject will be documented in writing:  
 
We will require written consent from each participant  prior to testing.  
 
 
25.[ADDRESS_978301] that the IRB waive the requirement to obtain wri tten documentation of consent 
(e.g., consent to participate is indicated by [CONTACT_7326] a button for an online questionnaire – after the consent information is presented and before the questionnaire begins) : 
 
Considering that a verbal consent process will be used for the phone screening, we would like to request a waiver of written documentation of the consent process.  For this waiver, 
we are expected to explain how the two criteria below have been met.   
 1. The research presents no more than mini mal risk of harm to subjects.  
 The screening process that will be completed before obtaining written documentation (a questionnaire completed over the phone) presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects.  I f we need to complete a DEXA scan on any subjects, we will obtain written 
consent from these subjects prior to this scan.   
2. The research involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required 
outside of the research context.  
The research  procedures we plan to complete prior to written consent (a questionnaire 
completed over the phone) do not normally require written consent outside of the 
research context.  
 
 
25.3 If you will document consent in writing, attach a consent document with 
places for signatures. If you will obtain consent, but not document consent in writing, please attach the consent script or text. Review “CHECKLIST:

● Describe t he PI’s availability to supervise the research.  
● Justify the feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within the agreed recruitment period. For example, how many potential subjects do you have access to? What percentage of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? 
● Describe the time that you will devote to conducting and completing the research.  
● Describe your facilities.  
● Describe the availability of medical o r psychological resources that 
subjects might need as a result of an anticipated or unanticipated consequence of participation in the research.  
● Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the research are adequately informed about the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties and functions (e.g., training plans, detailed study notebooks). 
 
The PI (Madigan) will have adequate availability to supervise this research, and dedicate 
the require d amount of time to this project. 
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_717447].  In particular, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_717448], take written notes and provide verbal feedback during these sessions, 
and debrief students with his notes after the pi[INVESTIGATOR_717449].  This will be repeated until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_717450](s).  
 Training and testing sessions will take place in the Virginia T ech Occupational 
Ergonomics and Biomechanics Lab. This lab is well -equipped with high- precision 
measurement tools and safety equipment used to assess gait, including all the equipment required for the current study. All personnel using laboratory equipment will be t rained 
on how to use t he equipment prior to testing.

Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, [ADDRESS_1210183]  
This is a randomized contr olled trial examining the effects of one experimental factor 
(combination Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) vs . varenicline vs.  placebo for 3 months) 
and one non -experimental participant characteristic: CHRNA5 genotypes associated with high, 
intermediate,  and low risk levels for nicotine dependence and smoking cessation failure. Based 
on the frequency distribution of these genotypes, there will be sufficient numbers of each 
genetic group represented in the active and placebo arm. All patients will receive intensive 
smoking cessation counseling. We will examine the main effects of medication ( combination 
NRT vs. varenicline vs. placebo) and genotype (high, intermediate, and low risk), as well as the 
pharmacogenetic interaction between genotype and medication  on the primary cessation 
outcome (abstinence at end of treatment, ABST_EOT) and other outcomes (abstinence at 6 
months). We chose the primary efficacy measure of abstinence at 3 months (EOT) because 
preliminary data (Chen et al., 2012) suggest the genetic  effects on cessation take place in the 
early cessation stage. Our hypothesis is that NRT significantly increases smoking abstinence in 
patients possessing high -risk haplotypes, but not amongst patients without such haplotypes.  
 
This experiment will answe r the following questions:  
1) Is there a genot ype X Pharmacotherapy  (cNRT vs. placebo)  interaction with regard to 
abstinence?  
2) Is there a genotype X Pharmacotherapy (varenicline vs. placebo) interaction with regard to 
abstinence?  
 
 
This study has been  designed following the guidelines and recommendations for conducting 
and reporting the results of clinical trials as described in the CONSORT (Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials) statement. In addition, the design and methodology of the study 
are consistent with current guidelines and recommendations provided by [CONTACT_867408] (Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco recommendations for 
follow -up procedures).  
A2 Primary Hypothesis  
Hypothesis #[ADDRESS_1210184] (cNRT vs. placebo) varies with CHRNA5 
(i.e. a genotype X medication interaction). A series of logistic regression models will be used to 
exami ne main effects of genotype ( rs16969968) and medication before testing genotype x 
medication interactions, with sex, age, and study cohort as covariates using logistic regression 
models.   
 
Hypothesis #[ADDRESS_1210185] (varenicline vs. placebo) varies with 
CHRNA5 (i.e.  a genotype X medication interaction). A series of logis tic regression  model s will 
be used to examine main effects of genotype ( rs16969968) and medication before testing 
genotype x medication interactions, with sex, age, and study cohort as covariates using  logistic 
regression models .

A3 Purpose of the Study Pr otocol  
This experiment will answer the following questions:  
1) Is there a genotype X Pharmacotherapy (cNRT vs. placebo) interaction with regard to 
abstinence?  
2) Is there a genotype X Pharmacotherapy (varenicline vs. placebo) interaction with regard to 
abstinence?  
 
B Background  
 
B1 Prior Literature and Studies  
In a general population sample of smokers seeking to quit, we recently discovered that genetic 
markers in the CHRNA5 gene predict cessation success and response to pharmacotherapy. 
Patients with the hig h-risk variants had a 3 -fold enhanced response to pharmacotherapy as 
compared to those with the low -risk and intermediate -risk variants. This information can be             
used to separate patients who are at serious risk of smoking relapse without pharma cotherapy 
from those who are likely to be able to quit on their own and thus not benefit from the 
medication (Chen et al, 2012) . These results have been replicated in the large  
Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction Treatment (PNAT) consortium (Bergen et a l, 2012). To 
address the current barriers to pharmacotherapy use which lead to failed smoking cessation in 
these patients, this genetically informed treatment study will investigate how genetic information 
can be used to personalize cessation pharmacothera py to maximize efficacy for patients.  
 
B2 Rationale for this Study  
Our overarching goal is to identify the most appropriate genetically informed smoking cessation 
treatments for smokers hopi[INVESTIGATOR_867383] . 
Our recent finding suggests that the effect of pharmacoth erapy on cessation varies with 
genotype (nicotinic receptor gene, CHRNA5 ): pharmacotherapy significantly increases 
abstinence amongst individuals with the high -risk genetic variants, but provides little benefit to 
individuals with the low -risk variants. Th e genotype is useful to predict relapses and response to 
medication (Chen et al, 2012). Weighing both risk and efficacy on cessation success we will 
identify smokers who are more likely to relapse, and need pharmacotherapy in order to attain 
optimal outcom es versus those who will receive little benefit from pharmacotherapy. This work 
can lead to personalized treatment that promotes long term cessation success by [CONTACT_867409].

C Study Objectives  
 
C1 Primary Ai m 
Specific Aim 1: To recruit 822 participants who are active smokers  in a smoking cessation trial. 
All patients will be randomized to combination NRT ( Nicotine Replacement Therapy ) with 
nicotine patch and lozenge, or varenicline,  or placebo for 3 months. A ll patients will receive 
intensive smoking counseling. These patients will be assessed in person at  baseline,  3 months  
(if biochemical verification of abstinence is needed) , 6 months  (if biochemical verification of 
abstinence is needed) , and by [CONTACT_756] a t the last day pre -quit, quit date, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 
weeks , 3 months (if biochemical verification of abstinence is not needed), 6 months (if 
biochemical verification of abstinence is not needed) and 1 year after the quit date .  
 
Specific Aim 2: To determ ine if the effect of cessation pharmacotherapy ( combination Nicotine 
Replacement Therapy (NRT) vs. varenicline vs. placebo for 3 months) on abstinence varies 
significantly with  genotype. We will examine the association between two genetic variants in the 
CHRNA5 gene and treatment on smoking cessation success (abstinence at end of treatment 
(ABST_EOT)). We will test the main effects of pharmacotherapy and genotype, as well as the 
interaction between them. Secondary cessation outcomes include abstinence at [ADDRESS_1210186] a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial of 822 participants to examine 
the association between the genetic variants ( CHRNA5),  treatment, and cessation success 
(abstinence at end of treatment (ABST_EOT)). We will evaluat e secondary cessation outcomes 
(abstinence at 6 months and 1 year).  
Primary O utcome Measure:  7-day point prevalence abstinence [Time  Frame:  Week 12]  
The definition of this measure requires: (a) no self -reported smoking (not even a puff of a 
cigarette) for at least the 7 days prior to the assessment, and (b)  CO biochemical verifica tion of 
abstinence.  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures:  Continuous Abstinence (11 weeks)  [Time  Frame:  [ADDRESS_1210187] 1 week initial grace period]  
The definition of this measure requires: Not taking even [ADDRESS_1210188] 1 week initial grace period . 
 
7-day point prevalence quit rate [Time  Frame:  Week 24]  
The definition of this measure requires: (a) no self -reported smoking (not even a puff of a 
cigarette) for at least the 7 days prior to the assessme nt, and (b) biochemical verification of 
abstinence.

_______________________________________________________________________________ ________ ______  
 6  
Number of days to lapse and relapse [Time  Frame:  Assessed from the target quit day through 
52 weeks.]  
The number of days to lapse is defined as the number of days from the target quit date until the 
participant reports smoking (even a single puff). The number of days to relapse is defined as the 
number of days from the target quit day until the first of seven consecutive days of smoking.  
 
Initial Cessation [Time  Frame:  Assessed for the first seven days a fter the target quit date.]  
Defined as at least [ADDRESS_1210189] 7 days after the target quit day.  
 
Longitudinal models of abstinence outcomes across multiple time points [  Time  Frame:  0-52 
Weeks  ] 
The definition of this measure requir es; no self -reported smoking (not even a puff of a cigarette) 
for at least 7 days prior to the assessment.  
Longitudinal models of smoking quantity in cigarettes per day outcomes across multiple time 
points. [  Time  Frame:  0-52 Weeks  ]The definition of this measure requires self -reported 
cigarettes per day.  
Medication adherence [  Time  Frame:  Pre-quit week to Week 12  ]Adherence is the proportion of 
expected medication (varenicline, patch, lozenge) taken as advised during pre -quit week to 
week 12  
Side effects [  Time  Frame:  Pre-quit week to Week 12  ]  
All reported side effects (occurring>4%) will be summarized and presented for the study. In 
addition, the investigators will further identify a pre -specified set of key side effects as being 
related to drug agonist effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, racing heart, headache, and sleep 
disturbance). These will be analyzed as rate of occurrence during the period of medication use.  
 
Withdrawal [  Time  Frame:  Pre-quit week to Week 4  ] 
Withdrawal severity is assessed by [CONTACT_867410] (WSWS) overall 
withdrawal scores, craving, and negative affect scores.

D Study Design  
 
D1 Overview  or Design Summary  
This is a  rs16969968 based stratified randomized controlled trial design examining the effects of 
one experimen tal factor ( combination NRT vs. varenicline vs. placebo for 3 months) and one 
non-experimental participant characteristic: CHRNA5  genotypes associated with high, 
intermediate, and low risk levels for nicotine dependence and cessation failure. Based on the 
frequency distribution of these genotypes, there will be sufficient numbers of each genetic 
groups represented in the active and placebo arm. We will examine the main effects o f 
medication ( cNRT vs placebo  as well as varenicline vs. placebo ) and genotypes (high, 
intermediate, and low risk), as well as the pharmacogenetic interaction between the genotypes 
and medication on the primary cessation outcome (abstinence at e nd of treatment, ABST_EOT) 
and other outcomes (abstinence at 6 months and 1 year). We choos e the primary efficacy 
measure of abstinence at 3 month (EOT) because our preliminary data from the UW -TTURC 
trial suggest the genetic effects on cessation take place in the early cessation stage. Our 
hypothesis is that NRT significantly increases smoking abstinence in patients possessing high -
risk genotypes , but not amongst p atients without such  genotypes . 
This experiment will achieve Aims 1 and 2 by [CONTACT_867411]:  
1) Is there a genotype X Pharmacotherapy (cNRT vs. placebo) interaction  with regard to 
abstinence?  
2) Is there a genotype X Pharmacotherapy (varenicline vs. placebo) interaction with regard to 
abstinence?  
 
D2 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
Some s ubjects for this study have participated in the previous stud y: the Collaborati ve Genetic 
Study of Nicotine Dependence (COGEND) . Subjects who participated in COGEND must have 
provided a DNA sample. Subjects must have given permission  to share data and to be 
contact[CONTACT_867412] . Subjects must have active nicot ine dependence. 
We are expand ing enrollment opportunities to the community, by [CONTACT_867413], and smokers interested in smoking cessation in the local community.  These 
participants must give permission  to share data . When participants agree  to be part of this study

2.c Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process  
We propose to enroll previous participants of the COGEND study , VFH, and the local 
community. We expect we can successfully recruit 822 patients in 3 years.  
 
Step 1. Screening of Potentially Eligible Subjects  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_867384].  
   
1) Subject agreed to be contact[CONTACT_867414] a smoking cessation trial.  
 
Step 2. Ask the potential participant the following screening questions to determine eligibility.

2) Are you committed to participating in this study on treatment for smoking 
cessation for a full year?  
3) Are you willing to use birth control for 3 months while you are receiving medication 
treatment for smoking cessation  and one month after ? (ONLY for pre -menopausal 
women)  
4) Are you pregnant or breast feeding? (ONLY for pre -meno pausal women)  
5) Do you currently take the medication Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], Wellbutrin, Zyban, Varenicline, or

10) Do you currently have thoughts of suicide or have a suicide attempt in the past 6 
months?  
11) Do you have end stage kidney disease requiring hemodialysis?  
 
Step 3. Smoking Verification  
 
Patients will complete a carbon monoxide (CO) breath test . A cut -off level of >=[ADDRESS_1210190]  or the research assistant . The 
patients will learn about general requirements for participation (e.g., need for follow -up, 
participation in assessments, etc.) as well as risks associated with nicotine toxicity, nicotine 
withdrawal, blood sample and pharmacotherapy. If still interested and eligible, the patients will 
then be asked to provide written informed consent to participate, on a form approved by [CONTACT_484757]. Study candi dates will 
read the informed consent document and be given an opportunity to ask any questions 
regarding study participation. They will also complete the consent form. A follow up contact [CONTACT_867415] t ime to consider participation. 
Participants will receive a signed copy of the consent document.  
 
2.d Randomization Method and Blinding  
The participants will be randomized with the ratio 1:1 :1 to the treatment arm of combination  
NRT (nicotine patch and lozenge ) plus smoking cessation counseling , or the treatment arm of 
varenicline plus smoking cessation counseling, or the treatment arm of placebo (patch  and 
lozenge or pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  plus smoking cessation counseling.  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned to 1) combina tion NRT plus counseling , 2) varenicline 
plus counseling, or 3) placebo plus counseling. SAS Version 9 statistical software will be used 
to generate the random assignment table  stratified by [CONTACT_867416]5 genotype rs16969968 . The 
group assignment and genotype will be coded to ensure that the double blind is maintained, and 
the interface will prevent staff from having access to the participant’s assignment  and genotype  
until after the baseline and post treatment assessments have been completed.  
2.e Risks and Benefits  
 
Risks associated with this research are judged to be minimal.  
 
Smoking withdrawal is associated with a number of unpleasant  symptoms such as sleep  
disturbance, hunger, craving, and negative mood. Most smokers have tried to quit in the past 
and are famili ar with these phenomena.  
 
With respect to the pharmacotherapy, participants will be made aware of the common side 
effects before they consent to participate in the study. It should be noted that the nicotine patch  
and lozenge are available over the counte r. The nicotine patch has very few side effects, but             
participants may have a local skin reaction, and rarely, individuals may have a more systematic 
Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, [ADDRESS_1210191] tolerance to nicotine, symptoms 
of acute nicotine toxicity (nausea and vomiting) are possible.  
 
Varenicline is approved by [CONTACT_867417] (end stage) kidney failure or hypersensitivity to 
varenicline. In addition, although no causal relationship has been established, current labeling 
for varenicline (FDA, 2011) recommends monitoring for serious neuropsychiatric sympto ms 
including changes in behavior, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and suicidal 
behavior. Varenicline labeling also notes that some individuals with pre -existing psychiatric 
conditions may experience worsening of their conditions. Preliminary data from the University  of 
Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW -CTRI) smoking cessation trials 
showed comparable rates of discontinuation and adverse events due to NRT and varenicline. 
The low rate of serious adverse events is consistent with recent data on  the safety of 
varenicline.  
 
Blood draw may result in bruising, and very rarely, infection at the site of needle stick.  
 
Some patients may experience emotional distress during evaluations for depression and 
anxiety.  
 
Finally patient confidentiality would be compromised if unauthorized individuals were to 
establish the identity of any participant.  
 
What is done to minimize the risks?  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867385]. This mo nitoring includes scheduled monthly meetings and review 
of written documentation. Unanticipated health event assessment, recording, reporting, and 
investigation will be accomplished through structured/standardized assessments of untoward 
occurrences/events , and regular monitoring by [CONTACT_763807]. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867386] a timely manner. Health events that raise concern s (e.g., 
allergic reaction, symptoms suggestive of nicotine toxicity, significant change in mood, suicidal 
ideation) will be immediately reported to the study physician who will determine an appropriate 
course of action.  
 
Potential side effects of combina tion  NRT (patch and lozenge) will be closely monitored.  
The transdermal NRT is chosen for testing in participants for these safety reasons:  
1) Transdermal NRT has slower absorption, lower peak serum level, and fewer  
cardiovascular effects, vs. varenclin e, which has an FDA warning on use with cardiac  
patients  
2) NRT is the most commonly used cessation medication in post -MI patients  
3)Fewer drug interactions (vs. bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], which has an unsafe interaction with an MAO 
inhibitor if the patient is depressed).   
             
Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, 2019  
   
_______________________________________________________________________________ ________ ______  
 11 Study participants will be closely monitored in accordance with current FDA  recommendations 
as well as the consensus recommendations of the 2008 Guideline Panel which provides 
additional detailed instructions for clinicians regarding all FDA  approved smoking cessation 
medications. We will follow the patient instruction and adverse events monitoring procedures 
used in the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW -CTRI). 
Patient education about possible side effec ts, access to a medication hotline, and ongoing 
monitoring will be consistent with FDA recommendations, clinical practice guidelines, and 
procedures successfully used in prior and ongoing UW -CTRI research using varenicline and 
combination NRT. This protoco l is consistent with the [ADDRESS_1210192].  
 
 
BENEFITS  
 
The potential benefits for smokers participating in this s tudy include the chance to receive free 
smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy, both of which double a smoker’s odds of 
quitting.  
 
In addition, this research has the potential to provide improved treatment strategies for clinicians 
trying to hel p patients quit smoking. This could result in more efficient provision of a maximally 
effective intervention for smokers.  
 
The proposed research will test combination NRT and varenicilne  in patients with different  
genetic markers and identify effective ph armacotherapy according to the genetic markers. The 
results from this study will allow researchers to determine which smoker subgroups will benefit 
from pharmacotherapy and which smoker subgroups will not. This should contribute to the 
improvement of stand ard clinical care of such patients, and may result in improved medical 
outcomes. Given the limited risks of NRT  and varenicilne , and the limited adverse effects, we 
believe that the potential risks involved in participating in the study are outweighed by t he 
benefits to both society and the individual.  
 
2.f Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
 
Once enrolled, follow -up protocols will assess the presence of medication side effects and  
Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, 2019  
   
_______________________________________________________________________________ ________ ______  
 12 unanticipated health events at all study visits and follow -up contacts. We will reco mmend 
dosage/use alternations as per good clinical practice if the patient experiences symptoms of 
nicotine toxicity or other troublesome side effects once they begin medication treatment.  
 
Should either excessive risk to study participants and/or lack of  measurable benefit to study 
participants be determined, the study will be stopped and all participants notified in a manner  
appropriate to the nature of the risk and/or lack of benefit.   
             
2.g When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
We are conducting this research with strong safety measures in place (close monitoring and 
screening) to gather the needed data without imposing unacceptable risks. The participants will 
remain under the care of their own physician(s) throughout the study. To facilitate saf ety, 
participants who are not medically appropriate to take combination NRT or varenicline  will not 
be included in the study ( see exclusion criteria ). Once enrolled, follow -up protocols will assess 
the presence of medication side effects and unanticipated health events at all study visits and 
follow -up contacts. We will recommend dosage/use alternations as per good clinical practice if 
the patient experiences symptoms of nicotine toxicity or other troublesome side effects once 
they begin medication treatmen t. We will refer patients to the study physician as needed.  
 
Participants’ medications  will be continued if they have relapsed to smoking regularly.  
Subjects with symptoms of nicotine toxicity (including diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, 
dizziness, and headache) reported at any research contact [CONTACT_867418] a chance to discuss their symptoms with the study 
physician ([CONTACT_186672]) or their primary care doctor , who will decide upon a course of actio n based 
upon the patient’s status and risk (e.g., a dose reduction or medication discontinuation). 
Emergency care will be administered as needed. If the only severe symptom is sleep 
disturbance, subjects will be instructed to remove the patch at night, but  otherwise keep 
receiving treatment according to the protocol. Should either excessive risk to study participants 
and/or lack of measurable benefit to study participants be determined, the study will be stopped 
and all participants notified in a manner app ropriate to the nature of the  risk and/or lack of 
benefit.  
 
Any patient who reports discomfort as a result of completing the assessment of depression and 
anxiety will be reminded that the evaluati on is discretionary, that it will be discontinued if the  
patient wishes, and that doing so will not affect the patient’s medical care. The experienced 
psychiatrist investigator will be on call in case a patient has an adverse reaction to a screening 
or outcome evaluation. We have administered these tests to over 2,[ADDRESS_1210193] data on their basic smoking status, and adverse effects.

 13 D3 Study Drug  
3.a Description  
The participants will be randomized with the ratio 1:1 :1 to the treatment arm of combination NRT 
(nicotine patch and lozenge) plus smoking cessation counseling , the treatment arm of 
varenicline plus counseling,  or to the treatment arm of placebo (patch  and lozenge or pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  plus 
smoking cessation counseling.  
 
3.b Treatment Regimen  
 
During the baseline visit (visit 1), all participants will be randomized at 1:1 :1 to 1) one arm of 
combination nicotine and smoking cessation counseling , or 2) varenicline and smoking 
cessation counseling,  and 3) another arm of placebo and smoking cessation  counseling at no 
cost to participants. Participants  will receive enough patches to l ast 12 weeks. The duration of 
medication treatment is 12 weeks (standard for participants who smoke >9 cigs/day= 8 weeks of 
21mg, 2 weeks of 14mg, and 2 weeks of 7mg nicotine patches; standard for participants who 
smoke 5 -9 cigs/day= 8 weeks of 14mg and 4 we eks of 7mg;).  
 
Nicotine Lozenge: The [ADDRESS_1210194] some cigarettes. Participants will then take 1 lozenge every 1 -2 
hours for 6 weeks, then 1 lozenge every 2 -4 hours for 3 weeks, and 1 lozenge for every 4 -8 
hours for 3 weeks. Participant s will be encouraged to take a minimum of 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]/day unless 
this amount produces adverse effects.  
 
Varenicline: Varenicline  will be initiated with a titration for 7 days before the quit date. Before the 
quit date, participants will take one 0.5mg tablet  daily for 3 days, then two 0.5mg tablets for 4 
days (one in the morning and one in the evening). After the quit date (day 8), participants will 
take 1mg tablet in the morning and in the evening.  
 
Placebo: 50% of participants assigned to the placebo group  will receive placebo patch/lozenge, 
and 50% will receive the placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_254012] a control for the two active medication arms.  
 
All participants will be given complete instructions on proper medication  use, and will be urged 
to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her physician and a  study hotline number immediately in case of listed symptoms 
of nicotine toxicity or side effects. Dose changes or discontinuation of NRT may be 
recommended; all changes will be addressed in analyses of adherence outcomes.  
 
3.c Method for Assigning Subjects t o Treatment Groups  
The participants will be randomized with the ratio 1:1 :1 to one treatment arm of combination  
NRT plus smoking cessation counseling , one treatment arm of  varenicline plus counseling, or to 
placebo plus smoking cessation counseling.  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned to each of the 3 arms.  SAS Version 9 statistical software 
will be used to generate the random assignment table. The group assignment will be coded to 
ensure that the double blind is maintained, and the interface will pre vent staff from having

3.f Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Subjects currently tak ing the medication Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], Wellbutrin, Zyban , will be excluded.  
 
Non-Study Treatment: P atients will be asked to refrain from non -study smoking cessation 
interventions  such as intensive smoking cessation counseling and smoking cessation 
medication  during treatment . Non -Study Treatment data will be assessed at each follow up visit 
to document whether the patient is receiving any non -study treatment for smoking cessation or 
other medical conditions, including medications, counseling, quit line, support groups, self -help 
books, and complementary/ alternative medicine remedies.  
3.g Packaging  
The stud y medication (Nicotine patch and place patch , varenciline, and placebo (patch and 
lozenge or pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] ) will have identical packaging when they are provided to the participants.  
3.h Blinding of Study Drug  
The group assignment will be coded to ensure that the doubl e blind is maintained, and the 
interface will prevent staff from having access to the participant’s assignment until after the 
baseline and post treatment assessments have been completed.

The Individual Patient Safety Committee (IPSC) will include the study’s key personnel: Li -Shiun 
Chen, M.D., M.P.H., Sc.D., a psychiatrist; Robert Carney, Ph.D., a psychologist;  Laura Bierut,  
M.D., a psych iatrist ; The IPSC will review monthly  reports on all participants. The IPSC will be 
blinded to the patient’s group assignment.  
 
In addition, we have a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB specifies overall 
monitori ng that will be conducted by [CONTACT_458], including timely reporting of AEs 
and SAEs. Every [ADDRESS_1210200] of the trial poses any undue risk for 
participants.  
 
The DSMB will include 1) a board -certified psychiatrist , Eric Lenz e, MD, 2) a cardiologist, 
Sharon Cresci, MD, 3) an internist sp ecialize in critical care and pulmonary health, Mario 
Castro, MD, 4) an internist with expertise in stroke prevention and personalized antithrombotic 
therapy, Brian Gage, MD , and 5) a statistician with expertise in research methodology, 
especially multicen ter clinical trials and analysis of administrative data sets, J. Philip Miller . All 
five have extensive experience with clinical trials. The DSMB will be blinded through the trial 
and convene every [ADDRESS_1210201] to adverse eve nts, dropouts, 
withdrawals, suicidality, and other problems as well as efficacy. They will make a 
recommendation at each meeting regarding whether to continue or discontinue the trial, the 
decision will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_867423].  
 
4.b Medical Monitoring  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867389]’s progress. This 
monitoring includes scheduled biweekly meetings with study staff and review of written 
documentation. Data that are re viewed at these meetings include the number and type of 
participants enrolled, the number and reasons for exclusions from enrollment, the number of 
participants treated and the stage of intervention, a summary and an individual review of any  
unanticipated  health events, and outcome data. In addition, any unanticipated health events that 
raise concerns (e.g., allergic reaction, symptoms suggestive of nicotine toxicity) will be 
immediately reported to the study physicians (PI [CONTACT_681377]).  
 
To facilitate p articipant safety, study participants must meet study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Once enrolled, follow -up protocols will assess the presence of medication side effects 
and unanticipated health events at all study visits and follow -up contacts. We wi ll recommend 
dosage/use alternations as per good clinical practice if the patient experiences symptoms of 
nicotine toxicity or other troublesome side effects. We will refer patients to the study physician 
as needed.  
 
If participants are smoking regularly,  we will tell them to continue taking the study medication  
and set another quit date as soon as possible . Should either excessive risk to study participants 
and/or lack of measurable benefit to study participants be determined, the study will be stopped 
and all participants notified in a manner appropriate to the nature of  the risk and/or lack of 
benefit.  
 
Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, 2019

4.c Definitions of Adver se Events  
 
Adverse events are assessed in each follow up visit up to the end of treatment.  
 
With respect to the pharmacotherapy, participants will be made aware of the common side 
effects before they consent to participate in the study. It should be noted  that the nicotine patch 
is available over the counter. The nicotine patch has very few side effects, but participants may 
have a local skin reaction, and rarely, individuals may have a more systematic allergic reaction. 
The most common side -effects associ ated with the nicotine patch are diarrhea, indigestion, 
nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, muscle and joint pain, sleeplessness, and abnormal dreams. 
Side effects associated with wearing an adhesive patch include skin rash, redness, and itching 
or irritation of the skin. In most cases, these side effects have been mild to moderate in intensity 
and go away once the patch is removed. Although most smokers have tolerance to nicotine, 
symptoms of acute nicotine toxicity (nausea and vomiting) are possible.

Smoking Status and Withdrawal : All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_867425]. We will assess long term outcomes following the SRNT Workgroup 
recommendations (Hughes et al, 2003) . 
 
Primary  Outc ome Measure :  
 
7-day point prevalence abstinence [Time  Frame:  Week 12]  
The definition of this measure requires: (a) no self -reported smoking (not even a puff of a 
cigarette) for at least the 7 days prior to the assessment, and (b)  CO biochemical verificat ion of 
abstinence.  
 
 
Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, 2019

 21 Secondary Outcome Measures:  
 
Continuous Abstinence (11  weeks) [Time  Frame:  [ADDRESS_1210205] 1 week initial grace 
period]  
The definition of this measure requires: Not taking even [ADDRESS_1210206] 1 week initial grace period . 
 
7-day point prevalence quit rate [Time  Frame:  Week 24]  
The definition of this measure requires: (a) no self -reported smoking (not even a puff of a 
cigarette) for at least the 7 days prior to the assessm ent, and (b) biochemical verification of 
abstinence.  
 
Number of days to lapse and relapse [Time  Frame:  Assessed from the target quit day through 
52 weeks.]  
The number of days to lapse is defined as the number of days from the target quit date until the 
participant reports smoking (even a single puff). The number of days to relapse is defined as the 
number of days from the target quit day until the first of seven consecutive days of smoking.  
 
Initial Cessation [Time  Frame:  Assessed for the first seven d ays after the target quit date. ]  
Defined as at least [ADDRESS_1210207] 7 days after the target quit day.  
 
 
A research assistant will be ascertaining smoking status. Finally, we will gather carbon 
monoxide (CO) data at 12-wk in -person visits  to biochemically validate self -reports: CO>8ppm 
will indicate smoking.   
 
Other  Assessments : WSWS , Environmental factors  will be assessed in each follow up visits.

F2  Interim Monitoring and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_867395]’s progress. This 
monitoring includes scheduled biweekly meetings with study staff and review of written 
documentation. Data that are reviewed at these meetings include the number and type of 
participants enrolled, the number  and reasons for exclusions from enrollment, the number of 
participants treated and the stage of intervention, a summary and an individual review of any  
unanticipated health events, and outcome data. In addition, any unanticipated health events that 
raise  concerns (e.g., allergic reaction, symptoms suggestive of nicotine toxicity) will be 
immediately reported to the study physicians (PI [INVESTIGATOR_867396] ).  
 
To facilitate participant safety, study participants m ust meet study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Once enrolled, follow -up protocols will assess the presence of medication side effects 
and unanticipated health events at all study visits and follow -up contacts. We will recommend 
dosage/use alternations as  per good clinical practice if the patient experiences symptoms of 
nicotine toxicity or other troublesome side effects. We will refer patients to the study physician 
as needed. If participants are smoking regularly and heavily (>=5 cigs daily), we will tel l them to  
discontinue taking the study medication.  
 
Should either excessive  risk to study participants and/or lack of measurable benefit to study 
participants be determined, the study will be stopped and all participants notified in a manner 
appropriate to the nature of the risk and/or lack of benefit.   
 
There is no plan of interim analyses of the primary hypothes is.  
F3  Analysis Plan  
 
 
All analyses will first be conducted separately for European Ancestry (EA) and African American 
(AA) due to distinctly different allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium across ancestry. If 
consistent genetic effects are seen across ancestry, samples of EA and AA ancestry will be 
combined in analyses with the covariate of race.  
 
Genetically I nformed Smoking Cessation Trial Study Protocol  Version 10: February 12, 2019  
   
_______________________________________________________________________________ ________ ______  
 23 We will compare the abstinence outcome in  the two placebo groups (placebo nicotine patch 
plus placebo nicotine lozenge vs. placebo varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]).  If they are comparable which is 
consistent with prior experience of other placebo -controlled smoking cessation trials, they will be 
pooled for fur ther analyses.   
 
The primary outcome is CO-confirmed point prevalent abstinence at end of treatment (12 
weeks) , defined if subjects deny smoking during 7 days prior of the end of treatment and 
provide a breath sample with CO <8 ppm.  
 
Hypothesis #[ADDRESS_1210210] (cNRT vs. placebo) varies with CHRNA5 
(i.e. a genotype X medication interaction). A series of generalized linear  models  will be used to 
examine main effects of genotype ( rs16969968) and medication before testing genotype x  
medication interactions, with sex, age, and study cohort as covariates  using logistic regression 
models.   
 
Hypothesis #[ADDRESS_1210211] (varenicline vs. placebo) varies with 
CHRNA5 (i.e.  a genotype X medication interaction). A ser ies of generalized  regression models  
will be used to examine main effects of genotype ( rs16969968) and medication before testing 
genotype x medication interactions, with sex, age, and study cohort as covariates using logistic 
regression models.   
 
Analysis Plan.  
We will use generalized linear models with logit as the link function to  model the primary 
outcome ( 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 weeks/end of treatment).  We will construct 
contrast models for each specific hypothesis testing and compare the goodness of fit for each 
contract. The primary method of analysis will be estimating a standard series of regression 
equations to test main effects, and gene – environment interaction (effect moderation) . 
 
Our primary analyses  will focus on SNPs, rs169 [ZIP_CODE], tagging nicotinic receptor genes 
CHRNA5 -A3-B4 and medication in our hypotheses testing for gene -medication interactions.   
Additional covariates include age, gender, measures of nicotine dependence severity (such as 
pre-quit cigarettes smoked per da y), adherence, and non -genetic factors.  
 
Secondary cessation outcomes include CO-confirmed 3 -month continuous abstinence with a 1 -
week grace period, 7 -day abstinence at 6 months, and 1 year, time to relapse (using Cox 
regression models), and withdrawal sev erity. Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE)108 will be 
used in longitudinal models comprising abstinence outcomes across 3 months, 6 months, and 1 
year in secondary analys es.  
 
 
Detailed analysis plan is included in the Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP) in Appendix K10.   
 
F4  Statistical Methods  
This is a randomized smoking cessation trial. Simple X2 tests, logistic regression models and 
cox proportional hazard models will be u sed to study the association between genetic markers 
and cessation outcomes.   
 
We will use generalized linear models with logit as the link function to model the primary 
outcome ( 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 weeks/end of treatment).  We will con struct

Detailed analysis plan is included in the Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP) in Appendix K10.  
F5  Missing Outcome Data  
If a participant prematurely discontinues the study medication, the reason for discontinuation will 
be determined and  classified as primarily due to an adverse event, or lack of efficacy, not 
wanting to take another medication, or others. We will examine missing data for causes and 
compare the groups with respect to side effects and efficacy.  We will adhere to the inten t-to-
treat principle for smoking outcome analyses, so that dropouts will be treated as smoking. In 
addition, we will analyze the missing data under conditions of both missing completely at 
random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR), and use appropriate stra tegies such as 
imputation when appropriate.  
Participants who drop of the trial before they get a dose of the study medication/placebo will be 
included in the analyses of efficacy if they receive the medication packet. They will be included 
in the safety a nalyses if medication was dispensed to them.  We will ensure an appropriate 
informed consent process to minimize the probability of drop out. We will also assess level of 
adherence to the study protocol and these information will be available for use in se condary 
analyses.  
 
F6  Unblinding Procedures  
The study medication will only be unblinded when there is a moderate to severe adverse event 
and this information is required for a medical evaluation of the subject. The principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_867397] d make a determination to coordinate study medication unblinding with the 
participant and the treating physician.

G5 Performance Monitoring   
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867389]’s progress. This 
monitoring includes scheduled biweekly meetings with study staff and review of written 
documenta tion. Data that are reviewed at these meetings include the number and type of 
participants enrolled, the number and reasons for exclusions from enrollment, the number of 
participants treated and the stage of intervention, a summary and an individual review  of any  
unanticipated health events, and outcome data. In addition, any unanticipated health events that 
raise concerns (e.g., allergic reaction, symptoms suggestive of nicotine toxicity) will be 
immediately reported to the study physicians (PI [INVESTIGATOR_867401] ).  
 
 
H Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
H1 Study Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
This study has a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP), and a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB).  The Individu al Patient Safety Committee (IPSC) will include three  of the study’s 
key personnel: Li -Shiun Chen, M.D., M.P.H., Sc.D., a psychiatrist; Robert Carney, Ph.D., a 
psychologist, Laura Bierut , M.D., a psych iatrist ; The IPSC will review monthly  reports on all  
participants. The IPSC will be blinded to the patient’s group assignment.  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867389]’s progress. This 
monitoring includes scheduled biweekly meetings with study staff and review of wr itten 
documentation. Data that are reviewed at these meetings include the number and type of 
participants enrolled, the number and reasons for exclusions from enrollment, the number of 
participants treated and the stage of intervention, a summary and an in dividual review of any  
unanticipated health events, and outcome data. In addition, any unanticipated health events that 
raise concerns (e.g., allergic reaction, symptoms suggestive of nicotine toxicity) will be 
immediately reported to the study physicians  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_867402] ).  
 
To facilitate participant safety, study participants must meet study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Once enrolled, follow -up protocols will assess the presence of medication side ef fects 
and unanticipated health events at all study visits and follow -up contacts. We will recommend 
dosage/use alternations as per good clinical practice if the patient experiences symptoms of 
nicotine toxicity or other troublesome side effects. We will re fer patients to the study physician 
as needed. If participants are smoking regularly, we will tell them to continue taking the study 
medication  and set another quit date as soon as possible .  Should either excessive risk to study 
participants and/ or lack o f measurable benefit to study participants be determined, the study will

 27 be stopped and all participants notified in a manner appropriate to the nature of the risk and/or 
lack of benefit.   
 
This DSMP requires that investigators notify the Washington Univer sity IRB in a timely manner 
of the occurrence of any unanticipated health events which are severe, unanticipated, and 
possibly related to study medication or protocol. If the unanticipated health event might be 
related to the medication use, both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 
manufacturer (Glaxo, Inc.  or [COMPANY_007]. Inc. ) will be notified within [ADDRESS_1210214] occurrences that result in dea th, are life -threatening, require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_763782], create persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
involve congenital anomaly/birth defects. Unanticipated health events would include less serious 
problem s that merit reporting because they are severe, unanticipated, and possibly related to 
study participation. Any serous unanticipated health event will be queried and reported even if it 
appears that the serious unanticipated health even is unrelated to stu dy participation. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867393], investigation, and 
follow -up of all study -related unanticipated health events.  
 
Unanticipated health event assessment, recording, reporting and investiga tion will be 
accomplished through staff training, structure/standardized assessments of untoward 
occurrences/events, and regular monitoring by [CONTACT_763807]. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_867403].  
 
In addition, we have a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB specifies overall 
monitoring that will be conducted by [CONTACT_458], including timely reporting of AEs 
and SAEs. Every [ADDRESS_1210215] of the trial poses a ny undue risk for 
participants.  
  
The DSMB will include 1) a board -certified psychiatrist , Eric Lenz e, MD, 2) a cardiologist, 
Sharon Cresci, MD, 3) an internist specialize in critical care and pulmonary health, Mario 
Castro, MD, and 4) an internist with e xpertise in stroke prevention and personalized 
antithrombotic therapy, Brian Gage, MD, and 5) a statistician with expertise in research 
methodology, especially multicenter clinical trials and analysis of administrative data sets, J. 
Philip Miller . All five have extensive experience with clinical trials. The DSMB will be blinded 
through the trial and convene every [ADDRESS_1210216] quit  date may be in person or over the phone.  The monitoring plan is outlined in the 
smoking cessation counseling guide.

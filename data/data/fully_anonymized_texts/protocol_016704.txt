Name [CONTACT_791]: IMO -2125  
Title of Study: A Phase 1/2 Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Intratumoral IMO -2125 
in Combination with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707127]: End of study will be  approximately  [ADDRESS_960747] patient in Phase 2 has commenced study treatment . Phase of development: 
Phase 1/2 
Rationale: IMO -[ADDRESS_960748] of Toll -like receptor (TLR) 9, stimulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems, 
and induces the expression of an array of endogenous cytokines and chemokines, including 
interleukin (IL) -1β, IL -6, IL -12, interferon (IFN) -α, IFN -γ, interferon gamma -induced protein 
(IP)-10, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) -α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1). Of 
note, activation of TLR9 by [CONTACT_58444] -2125 induces high levels of IFN -α from plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells (pDCs). This extensive profile of cytokines and chemokines results in the activation of both 
innate and adaptive immunity. Local innate immune activation through IMO -2125, administered 
by [CONTACT_707232] d infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ 
T cells and synergize with systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_707128] T lymphocyte antigen- 4 
(CTLA -4)/programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) blockade, resulting in superior anti -melanoma 
activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA -4 and is used in the treatment 
of metastatic melanoma that cannot be treated surgically. Pembrolizumab is a PD -1-blocking 
antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with unrese ctable or metastatic melanoma. In 
combination, IMO -2125 with either ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707129] a novel therapy to 
benefit patients with metastatic melanoma.  
Objectives:  
Primary: The primary objective of Phase 1 is to characterize the safety and determine a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMO -2125 when administered in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707130]. The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) and RP2D for IMO -2125 may differ 
between the combination of IMO -2125 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707131] -2125 and 
pembrolizumab.  
The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess preliminary clinical activity of IMO -2125 in 
combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707132]2D(s) 
in patients with metastatic melanoma  that is not responsive to PD -1 inhibitor therapy , using  
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST) v1.1.  
Secondary: The secondary objectives of Phase 1 are to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of single -dose IMO -2125 and repeat -dose IMO -2125 administered by [CONTACT_707233][INVESTIGATOR_707133]. An additional secondary objective 
of Phase 1 is to describe any preliminary an titumor activity.   
The seco ndary objectives of Phase 2 are to further assess the safety and tolerability of 
IMO -2125 in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707134] -related Response

    Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) and RECIST v1.1, overall survival (OS), OS at 
6 and 12 months , progression- free survival (PFS),  PFS at 6 and 12 months, durable response rate 
(DRR) , duration of response (DoR) , and disease control rate (DCR) . 
Exploratory: The exploratory objectives of Phase 1 and 2 are to assess  patient reported 
outcomes (PRO ), pre - and post -treatment blood biomarkers , pre- and post -treatment tumor 
biopsies for immunologic assessment, and explore  any potential association between th ese 
biomarker measures and anti tumor activity.  In addition, anti -IMO -2125, anti -ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and 
anti-pembrolizumab antibody formation will be assessed . 
Endpoints  
Primary: The primary endpoint of Phase [ADDRESS_960749] v1.1.  
Secondary:   
The secondary endpoint s in Phase 1 are:  
• PK assessments for IMO -2125;  
• ORR assessed using irRC and RECIST v1.1  
The secondary endpoints in Phase 2 include:  
• Safety and tolerability (type and frequency of AEs, clinical laborat ory values, 
electrocardiograms [ECGs], and vital sign measurements) for each combination;  
• Duration of response using RECIST  v1.1;  
• ORR and duration of response using ir RECIST;  
• PFS, defined as time from the initiation of treatment to disease progression by 
[CONTACT_299602] v1.1, or death from any cause;  
• PFS at 6 and 12 months;  
• OS, defined as time from initiation of treatment to death from any cause;  
• OS at 6 and 12 months;  
• Durable response rate by [CONTACT_299602] v1.1, defined as the rate of complete  
response (CR) plus partial response (PR) lasting at least [ADDRESS_960750] 12 months of study;  
• Disease control rate by [CONTACT_299602] v1.1, defined as the rate of CR, PR, or 
stable disease (SD).   
Exploratory:  The p re- and post -treatment exploratory endpoints of Phase 1 and 2 include, but 
are not limited to,  PRO using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire -CORE 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30), blood biomarkers (e.g., IFN -γ and  
other plasma cytokines) and tumor markers to assess any potential association between immune 
responses to IMO -2125 at the Week  8 tumor biopsy with tumor response in both injected and

    uninjected tumor lesions at Week  13 or at Week  23 (depending on the prot ocol version under 
which the patients were enrolled).  
Study design: This is a two  arm, open- label  Phase 1/[ADDRESS_960751] 
experienced symptomatic or confirmed radiographic progression during or after treatment with 
an anti -PD-(L)1 agent ( alone or in combination) will be eligible. Prior BRAF or MEK inhibitor 
treatment is not req uired. The s tudy will be conducted in two  parts : a dose -escalation portion 
(Phase 1) to evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple dose levels and a Phase 2 portion to 
assess preliminary efficacy.   
Phase 1:  The Phase 1 porti on of the study will explore escalating dose levels  of IMO -2125 ( from 
4 to 32 mg with de -escalation to 2 mg allowed  for each IMO -2125 combination) . For each 
cohort, IMO -2125 will be a dministered as a  once -weekly  intratumoral injection for 3 consecutive 
weeks  in Cycle 1 , followed by [CONTACT_707234] 5, 8, 11, 17, 23, and 29 ( Day 1 
of Cycles 2 through 7) . Both ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707135] 3  weeks beginning Day 1 of Cycle 1 Week 2 . Continued pembrol izumab dosing

product label is permitted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
Patients assigned to [ADDRESS_960753] 
not yet reached the end of the Treatment Period may receive the Week 17, 23, and 29 injections 
at the discretion of the treating I nvestigator .  
Each cohort will be monitored for the occurrence of dose -limiting toxicities ( DLTs ). The 
DLT  evaluation period will be Cycle 1 (Weeks 1 through 4) . If a patient discontinues study 
participation before the DLT evaluation period is finished due to reasons other than experiencing 
a DLT, that patient must  be replaced so that the cohort may be properly evaluated.  
There are 3 patients planned per cohort. During Phase 1 , the Sponsor will assign patients to a

    treatment arm ( IMO -2125  + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707138] -2125  + pembrolizumab) by [CONTACT_9084]. The 
Sponsor will maintain a prioritization schedule for cohort assignment in a separate document. A 
Cohort Review Committee (CRC) will be convened prior to each dose level escalation to review 
the available data and provide recommendations on study conduct. After completing the D LT 
evaluations for all planned IMO -[ADDRESS_960754] monthly th roughout Phase 1 of the study. After completion of either 
Phase 1 treatment arm and determination of the RP2D for that arm, the Phase 2 portion for the 
completed t reatment arm may be initiated. It is not necessary for Phase 1 to be completed in both 
treatment a rms before Phase 2 is started. After Phase 2 in either treatment arm is initiated, the 
Sponsor will assign the  treatment arm, cohort, and phase for patients.  
Dose -limiting toxicity  evaluations and CRC reviews for any additional immunotherapy 
combination cohorts will be done as described for the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707139]. 
Phase 2: The Phase [ADDRESS_960755]  v1.1, of IMO -2125  + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab, 
and any additional combinations that are studied in Phase 1. The dose level of IMO -[ADDRESS_960756] 60 patients treated at the IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707140]2D . This will 
include at least 21 patients in the primary IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707141] -evaluable population 
and up to 20 patients in the secondary IMO -2125 + ipi [INVESTIGATOR_707141] -evaluable population.  
In the IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab Phase 2 cohort, enrollment will continue until  21 patients in 
the IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab efficacy -evaluable population have been treated at the 
IMO -2125 +  pembrolizumab RP2D .  
Phase [ADDRESS_960757] for clinically and statistically relevant clinical activity . A 
treatment arm will stop if an interim futility analysis shows th ere is insufficient evidence of a 
clinically relevant response rate after 10 patients (Stage 1).  
If a patient discontinues  treatment  before completing at least one  efficacy evaluation for reasons 
other than toxicity , then that patient will be replaced, with the replacement assigned to the same 
treatment arm and dose level as the patient who dropped out early.  
Combination therapy in Phase 2 will continue using the same schedule as Phase 1, as presented 
in the schedule of dosing table. 
Assessments will be con ducted as defined in the Schedule of Evaluations  (Table  1 and Table  2). 
Number of patients (planned): The study will enroll approximately 90 to 100 patients. It is 
estimated that approximately 30 patients will be treated in  the dose -finding portion of  Phase 1 
and approximately 60 to 70 additional  patients will be treated in the Phase  2 portion of the study.

Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration:  
In Phase 1, the starting dose of IMO -2125 will be 4 mg  (Dose Level +1) for the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707146], and 8 mg (Dose Level +2) for the pembrolizumab combination (with de -escalation 
to 2 mg allowed  for each combination) . IMO -[ADDRESS_960767].   
IMO -2125 will be administered by [CONTACT_707236][INVESTIGATOR_707147] . 
Administration of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707148] -2125 when administered in  
the same week ; IMO -[ADDRESS_960768] occur on the scheduled dosing day ( ±2 day window). 
Note that tumor biopsies should be done prior to stud y treatment administration.  If a full dose 
can no longer be practically administered into the designated tumor for injection, another tumor 
may be selected.  In the event that complete tumor regression occurs in all accessible lesions prior 
to completion of  therapy, any remaining IMO -2125 doses should be administered into the tumor 
bed, except in the case of visceral lesions where remaining doses should be given s.c. to 
minimize procedural risks.  
Dose escalation:  Up to five dose levels for IMO -2125 are init ially planned (as shown in the table 
below ).

    In Phase 1, t he study will enroll patients in planned cohorts of 3, beginning at Dose Level +1 for 
the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707150] +2 for  the pembrolizumab  treatment 
arm once safety of the IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707151]. 
A charter will be used to guide the CRC’s decision -making.  
Additionally, if, due to observed toxicity, it proves difficult to provide IMO -[ADDRESS_960769] treatment cycle of 
each cohort. Using a prior beta(1,1) distribution of the DLT rate δ i for each dose level i, th e 
MTD is defined as the highest dose level  for which the  mean of the  posterior distribution  of 
toxicity is closest to but less than 25% among all the evaluated doses i  for which 
Pr (δ i > 0.25 | data)  <0.80. 
The RP2D(s) will be selected from dose  level (s) at or below the MTD. Additional dose levels  
may be studied if the MTD(s) have not been reached and pharmacodynamic activity is deemed to  
be inadequate. At the time of  completion of the Phase 1 portion of the study , an analysis of the 
data will be performed .  
Assuming a prior beta (0.6, 1.4)  distribution for the overall toxicity rate for a treatment, a Phase 2 
arm will terminate if the Pr (δ t > 0.25 | data) >0.80, where δ t is the DLT rat e attributable to the 
treatment . 
Dose -limiting toxicities:  Toxicity will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 toxicity criteria.  
Dose -limiting toxicities are defined in Section  8.1.5 and should be referenced throughout the 
Phase 1 and 2 portions of the study. The DLT evaluati on period will be Cycle 1 (Weeks 1 
through 4) .  
For the purpose s of dose level escalation and determination of the MTD (s), only DLTs (as 
defined below) that occur during the first cycle of treatment will be considered in the decisions 
regarding dose level escalation ; however, DLTs or other clinically significant toxicities that 
occur throughout the observation period will be  considered when determining the RP2D(s) for 
use in this trial and in subsequent clinical trials . 
During Cycle 1  of the dose escalation portion, if two  of the three patients  in a cohort  experience 
the same Grade 2, treatment- related AE , then subsequent increases in dose  level  will proceed in 
increments less than 100% . If more than one  cohort is treated at the same d ose level and greater 
than 67% of patients treated at that dose level experience the same Grade 2 t reatment -related AE, 
dose level escalation will proceed in increments less than  100%  (see table of planned dose level 
escalation above).  In such a case, s pecific dose level increments will be decided by [CONTACT_10186].  
Protocol -defined hematologic DLTs include:  
• CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days ; 
• CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever ≥ 38.5°C;  
• CTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding;  
• CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  ≥7 days .

    combination , then dosing should be interrupted and the toxicity should be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline. Treatment with the other agent may continue 
during this time period. If attribution cannot be clearly ascribed t o one agent versus the other, 
then both IMO -2125 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (or pembrolizumab) should be stopped and the toxicity 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline. If treatment is to be 
resumed, then re -initiation criteria must be met. If the DLT was clearly related to IMO -[ADDRESS_960777] be administered at a lower dose  
level  (a minimum reduction of at least one  dose level). If the DLT recurs after a dose level 
reduction, t hen treatment should be discontinued.  
Patients who experience a non -laboratory, IMO -2125- related DLT must be evaluated weekly, at  
a minimum, until resolution to  Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_960778]. For abnormal laboratory values that 
qualify as DLTs, patients will be followed twice weekly until values return to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_960779].  
Criteria for re -initiation of study treatment following occurren ce of a DLT are as follows:  
• ANC must be ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (1500/μL) ; 
• Platelets must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/μL) ; 
• All clinically significant non -hematologic toxicities for which a causal association to 
study treatment cannot be ruled out must be  Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia) or returned to 
baseline.  
If the patient does not meet these criteria, dosing will be delayed and the patient should be 
re-evaluated within 48 to 72 hours. If the next cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_726] 21 days  for toxicity , 
the patient should be removed from study treatment. In these situations, if the patient is 
experiencing clinical benefit and has a favorable risk/benefit profile, study treatment with 
IMO -2125 may be continued if agreed upon by [CONTACT_66229]. 
Duration of study : The study treatment period is 29 weeks  in the absence of intolerable toxicity 
or unequivocal disease progression. Continued treatment with pembrolizumab following the  
completion of  IMO -2125  study treatment is at the discretion of the Investigator  for patients in the 
IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab treatment arm.

    Assessments  
Safety: Safety assessments will include a comprehensive evaluation of AEs and/or toxicity based 
on: 
• Results of monitoring vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature) ; 
• Results of clinical chemistry, h ematology/coagulation, complement testing, thyroid 
function testing, and urinalysis  tests ; 
• ECG  results;  
• Changes in physical examination ; 
• Need for concomitant medications ; 
• ECOG performance status . 
Hematology assessment will inc lude a complete blood count  (CBC)  with a differential and a 
coagulation profile  will include prothrombin time  (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) . The clinical chemistry panel will include the liver function tests  (AST, ALT, and 
serum bilirubin ), blood urea nitrogen, complement (total hemolytic complement activity 50 
[CH50 ], and complement components C3 and C4 ), and serum creatinine. The urinalysis will 
include urinary protein. 
Pharmacokinetics:  The plasma PK of single -dose IMO -2125 and the PK of repeat -dose 
IMO -2125 administered  by [CONTACT_707238][INVESTIGATOR_707152]. The following parameters will be 
determined for IMO -2125 plasma PK , if appropriate : 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max); 
• Time of C max (tmax); 
• Area under the curve from [ADDRESS_960781] measurable plasma concentration (AUC 0-t). 
Serum concentrations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707153] 2, 5, 8, 11, 
17, and 23. For patients who continue pembrolizumab treatment, pembrolizumab pre -dose PK 
samples should be collected before dosing at all visits. A post -dose pembrolizumab PK sample 
should be collected 30 minutes after the initiation of pembrolizumab infusion at Week  23 (if 
administered) . 
Efficacy:  Efficacy will be evaluated by [CONTACT_707239] . Treatment 
decisions should be based on patient benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_707240] [ADDRESS_960782] v 1.1.  
Exploratory:  Exploratory variables will be assessed at pre -treatment and post -treatment and 
may include , but are not limited to:  
• PRO : Period ic assessments will be made using the EORTC -QTQ- C30 
• Biomarkers (CD8+ T  cells, natural killer cells, pDC/myeloid DC, memory T  cells in 
tumor tissue, T  cells, and cytokine levels in blood)  
• Any potential association between these biomarkers and antitumor activity

    • Gene profili ng (with ribonucleic acid [RNA]  and deoxyribonucleic [DNA] extraction)  
• Immunogenicity (antibodies to IMO -2125, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and pembrolizumab)  
For Phase 1, biopsies of the injected tumor will be performed at the Screening Visit (within 
[ADDRESS_960783] treatment); within 24 to 48 hours after IMO -2125 injection on Week 1 
(Cycle  1); Week 2 ( Cycle 1; optional) ; during Week 8 (Cycle 3) ; and optionally  at Week  13 
(Cycle 4) and  at the time of disease progression or during Week 23, whichever is later . Tumor 
biopsies of the designated non- injected lesion will be performed at Screening , prior to the first 
dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707154] (optional), and during Week 8. For Phase 2, tumor 
biopsies are optional at all specified visits. Surgical methods (e.g., punch or core) are preferred 
over Fine Needle Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_477104].  
Biopsies should be done prior to study treatment administration. For those patients who have 
liver or other visceral metastases injected with IMO -2125, repeat biopsy of liver or other visceral 
tumor lesions may not always be possible. Therefore, repeat biopsies will be performed only 
when feasi ble in these patients.  
The Week 8 (Cycle 3) and Week 13 (Cycle 4) biopsies may be performed within a ±3  day 
window. If tumor response is observed early during initial treatment, the Week 8 biops ies may 
be performed at an earlier time point so as to ensure meaningful biomarker information is 
obtained prior to complete resolution of tumor.  
Statistical methods: Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics such 
as mean, standard deviation, median, and range. Categorical  variables will b e summarized by 
[CONTACT_707241], and if specified, with 95% confidence intervals for the proportion. Missing 
data will not be imputed  except as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
Data will be analyzed at the end of dose -finding for each treatment . Phase 2 data will be 
analyzed at the end of Phase 2 ( approximately  [ADDRESS_960784] patient in Phase 2 has 
commenced study treatment ). 
Efficacy populations will include : 
• Primary Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] + IMO -2125 Effica cy Evaluable (PI[INVESTIGATOR_707155]) Population: all patients

The OS and  PFS proportions w ill be estimated  at 6 and 12 months; OS and PFS will also b e 
analyzed overall.  For time -to-event endpoints (OS, PFS, and DoR), the Kaplan- Meier method 
will be used to estimate the probability of event- free survival . Patients who have not experienced 
the ev ent at the data cut -off date for study closure  will be censored . Patients who are lost to 
follow up will be censored at the last valid disease assessment for PFS and date of last contact 
[CONTACT_707242] . Kaplan -Meier plots will be produced for OS and PFS by [CONTACT_273920] . 
Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
Patterns of missing data will be described for PRO. Mean change from Baseline in the global 
health status score over time will be summarized and presented graphically. A mixed model for 
repeated measures may be used to assess the statistical significance of changes from Baseline. 
Exploratory endpoint analyses will be fully described in the statistical analysis plan.  
Determination of Sample Size  
The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess the preliminary clinical activity , defined as the 
investigator -assessed ORR, of IMO -2125 in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707158] -2125 in 
combination with  pembrolizumab in patients with progression on or following PD -(L)1 inhibitor 
therapy for metastatic melanoma. Given that two p rimary hypotheses are being tested ( regarding 
the ORR of IMO -2125 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707159] -2125 and pembr olizumab), a 
Bonferroni correction has been applied to the alpha to control the  Type I error  rate for the trial . 
Assuming the ORR for patients  who receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707160] 11% (the historical 
response rate in patients who are PD -1 inhibitor  naïve), and a target  ORR of 35% for patients 
who re ceive IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707161], a sample size of 21 patients would 
achieve 77 % power to detect a 24% difference in response rates using a one -sided significance 
level of 2.5%.  
The IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707162] a two -stage design with a targeted Type I 
error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_960787] 35% . 
With this method, [ADDRESS_960788] v1.1 response in Stage 1, then the

Protocol 2125- 204, Version 8.0  Date: [ADDRESS_960789]  v1.1 response, then the null hypothesis H o will be rejected in 
favor of the alternative H a. In this treatment arm, this design has statistical power of 77%, an 
expected sample size of 13.[ADDRESS_960790] stage of 69.7% if the response proportion is ≤0.11.  
Assuming a RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_960791] 5%, and a target ORR of 35% for patients who receive IMO -2125 
+ pembrolizumab combination treatment, a sample size of 21 efficacy -evaluable patients would 
achieve 96% power to detect a 30% difference in response rates using a one -sided significance 
level of 2.5%.  
The IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab treatment arm will use a two -stage design with a targeted 
Type  I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_960792] 35% . If at 
least [ADDRESS_960793] v1.1 
response, then the  null hypothesis H o will be rejected in favor of the alternative H a. In this 
treatment arm, this design has statistical power of 96%, an expected sample size of 14.41, and a 
probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_707163] 60% if the response proportion is ≤0.05. 
Analysis of PK  
For each cohort, the plas ma IMO -2125 concentration data will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_105]-compartmental PK analysis . Descriptive statistics will be provided for concentration data 
and all PK assessment values by [CONTACT_5349] (IMO -2125, i pi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and pembrolizumab), dose, 
and time, as appropriate.  
Dose proportionality using the power model will be evaluated in an exploratory manner, if the 
data permit. If insufficient data are available to assess dose proportionality using the power 
mode l, dose normalized data will be presented for a graphical assessment.

    4. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
4.1. Metastatic Melanoma : The Disease Under Study  
Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes which are found predomi nantly in skin, but also 
in the mucous membranes  and eye. Melanoma causes the majorit y of skin cancer -related deaths . 
In 2014, 76,100 people in the US were newly diagnosed with either invasive or in situ melanoma 
and 9,710 cases were fatal. While the incid ence of many types of cancer has remained stable or 
declined, the incidence rates are increasing for melanoma and the probability of developi[INVESTIGATOR_707171] (Sie gel 2015).  
Although melanoma is a rare form of skin cancer, it comprises over 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
Patients with early (stage 1) lesions have 3 -year survival rates (>90%); however, patients with 
late-stage melanoma often have poor prognoses and survival rates (≤10%) with a median 
survival of <8 months from time of diagnosis  (Lachiewicz  2008). 
Melanoma t reatment is dependent upon the stage of the cancer at the time of detection and the 
properties of the tumor . Tumors in early stages  can be removed surgically. However, i f a biopsy 
reveals that the cancer has metastasized and spread to lymph nodes, treatments are more likely to 
include  radiation and chemotherapy  regimens . While the goal of chemotherapy treatments is to 
induce apoptosis, or cell death , of the cancer cells , healthy noncancerous cells are often a ffected 
and are responsible for many of the adverse effects of systemic non -specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  A new 
approach to cancer therapy is immunotherapy; stimulation of the patient’s own immune 
mechanisms that are responsible for naturally eliminating cancer cells.  
4.2. Current Standard of Care Therapy  
Melanoma that has metastasized is typi[INVESTIGATOR_707172]; surgery and radiation 
can be used in a palliative manner to treat sym ptoms of local tumor growth. Cy totoxic 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (both alone and in combinations) have been used for more than 30 years and 
include alkylating  agents (dacarbazine, temoz olomide, and nitrosoureas), the platinum analogs, 
and the microtubular toxins (vinca alkaloids and toxanes) ( Bhatia  2009).  
In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)  approved the use of recombinant interleukin 
(IL)-2 to treat advanced melanoma ( Atkins, 1999; Atkins, 2000) and interferon (IFN )-α has also 
been used  as treatment either after surgery or in combination with other melanoma therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
(Kirkwood, 2000) . More recently, check point inhibitors (CPIs) have emerged as a new 
immunology -based frontier to effect antitumor activity. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) targeted to cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA -4). CTLA -4, present on CD4+ and 
CD8+ T lymphoc ytes is involved in maintaining a specific population of r egulatory T  cells and is 
a negative re gulator  of T cell activation ( Brunet 1987; Levings 2001). By [CONTACT_707243] -4, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707173] T cell 
proliferation and activation (Walunas 1994) . Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are mA bs targeted 
to programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) (Shin and Ribas 2015) . The combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707174]-PD-1 antibodies for the treatment of metastatic mela noma has demonstrated impressive 
antitumor activity, including 11.5 months median progression- free survival ( PFS; Larkin  2015)  
and 61%  objective response rate ( ORR; Postow  2015) , but with increased toxicity over

    single -agent therapy. An unmet need remains in this patient population for novel CPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_707175] 
(Zamarin and Postow  2015) .  
Intratumoral  administration of IMO -2125 is a logical complement to CPIs. Intratumoral 
IMO -2125 has been shown in nonclinical models to improve systemic antitumor immunity 
through stimulation of local antigen presentation, generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and 
increasing the number and extent of tumor -infiltrating T cells , which is highly corre lated with the 
effectiveness of CPI [CONTACT_48831]  (Tumeh  2014) . 
4.3. Toll-like Receptors and Their Agonists  
The human innate immune system recognizes biochemical patterns that may be associated with 
pathogens (pathogen -associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs). Immune  system cells contain 
toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) that recognize PAMPs. Ten functional TLRs have been identified in 
humans. Some TLRs are expressed on the cell surface and recognize PAMPs such as 
lipopeptides, lipopolysaccharides, and flagellin. Other TLRs are expressed intracellularly on 
endosomal membranes and recognize single - and double -stranded ribonucleic acid ( RNA ; 
TLRs  3, 7, and 8) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) containing unmethylated cytosine -guanine 
(CpG) dinucleotides (TLR9), which are patterns a ssociated with viruses or bacteria. The cellular 
distribution of TLRs also varies. TLR9 in humans is expressed only in plasmacytoid dendritic 
cells (pDCs) and B  cells, both of which are components of the peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells ( PBMCs) ([COMPANY_005] a nd Akira  2005; Wickelgren 2006). Activation of some TLRs causes 
signaling cascades that can promote cytokine production through the nuclear factor 
kappa -light-chain -enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) or an IFN regulator factor mechanism 
(Abreu  2010).  
TLR 9 agonists induce pDCs to produce type I IFN and other cytokines and chemokines, which 
in turn activate other immune cells including T cells, monocytes, natural killer ( NK) cells, and 
macrophages (Liu, 2005). Agonists of TLR9 also induce activation, differ entiation, and 
proli feration of B  cells (Bernasconi  2002) . Together, the innate and adaptive immune responses 
generated through TLR9 produc e a profile of potentially anti tumor cytokines and chemokines, 
antigen -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and enhanced antigen presentation capabilities  (Liu  
2005) .  
4.3.1. Toll-like Receptor A gonists in the Treatment of Solid T umors  
Human TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed primarily o n pDCs  ([COMPANY_005] and Akira 2005; Wickelgren 
2006) , which play a fundamental role in the regulation of the immune response during tumor 
development . Plasmacytoid DC s are present in high numbers within cutaneous melanoma and 
tumor -draining lymph nodes; however, the inf iltration of these cells is correlated with a poor 
clinical outcome.  Within the melanoma tumo r environment, pDCs were found to promote  a T 
helper (Th)  2-type response with a regulatory immune profile, promoting tumor progression 
(Aspord  2013) . In contra st, pDC activation via a TLR [ADDRESS_960825]  facilitates Th1 -type adaptive 
immune responses, including the generation of antigen -specific antibodies, cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes , and memory T  cells , all of which can lead to T  cell-mediated tumor destruction .

    4.4. IMO -2125 
4.4.1. Mechanism of Action  
Immune Modulatory Oligonucleotide -2125 ( IMO -2125) , a novel phosphorothioate  
oligodeoxynucleotide , is composed of 2 strands of modified D NA joined at their 3’ ends. 
IMO -2125 was created by [CONTACT_707244], Inc. through a structure activity approach to 
the design of TLR -targeted drug candidates based on modifications of class ical CpG DNA (Yu, 
2002; Kandimalla, 2003; Kandimalla, 2005). IMO -[ADDRESS_960826] spectrum of innate and adaptive 
immune responses, including antigen- specific cytotoxic T lym phocyte responses. IMO -2125 
stimulates pDCs and B cells through TLR9 to initiate a rapid innate immune response 
characterized by [CONTACT_707245] -1β, IL -6, IL-12, IFN-γ, 
interferon gamma -induced protein (IP) -10, tumor  necrosis factor (TNF) -α, monocyte 
chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1), and, particular to pDC  cells, high amounts of IFN -α. A 
secondary phase of the innate immune response is activation of NK cells, monocytes, and 
neutrophils and margination of lymphocytes out of systemic circulation. These hematological 
effects are evident consi stently at [ADDRESS_960827] -dose. T  cells are induced by [CONTACT_707246]/chemokine response into a Th1- type cellular response that includes production of 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes and antige n-specific memory T cells.   
4.4.2. Nonclinical Pharmacodynamics  
When IMO -2125 was subcutaneously ( s.c.) administer ed into cynomolgus monkeys, plasma 
concentrations of IFN -α began to increase early, peaking at approximately [ADDRESS_960828] 96 hours at a dosage of 4 mg/kg (Trombino 
2007a). Other signs of immune stimulation foll owing in vivo administration of IMO -2125 
included increased plasma concentrations of IL -12 and IP -10; changes in trafficking of white 
blood cells (WBCs), particularly a transient decrease peripheral blood lymphocytes at [ADDRESS_960829]-dose; and increased ex pression of the activation marker CD69 on T cells, B cells, and NK 
cells (Trombino  2007b).  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including pDCs and B cells, were isolated from healthy 
volunteers and stimulated in vitro with IMO -2125  for 6 to 48 hours (Bhaga t 2007a, 
Bhagat  2007b, Bhagat 2007c, Bhagat 2007d, Bhagat 2007e). IFN -α and IP -[ADDRESS_960830] ivation, normal T cell 
expressed and secreted (RANTES). Further indications  of in vitro immune stimulation in these 
cultures were the induction of B cell proliferation and increased expression of CD86 and CD69 
activation markers on B cells and pDCs (Bhagat  2007f, Bhagat 2007g; Bhagat 2007h).

    [IP_ADDRESS]. Studies in Model s of Disease  
The nonclinical  rational e for use of IMO -2125 in immune oncology comes from mechanism of 
action studies in vitro and in  vivo and from anti tumor activ ity in mouse xenograft models. 
Clinical p roof of concept is derived from studies in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection .  
• Cytokine induction profile in in vitro studies using human PBMCs and pDCs show 
IMO -[ADDRESS_960831] been implicated 
in the intratumoral mechanism of action ; 
• Induction of IFN -α and IP -10 in cynomolgus monkeys, with activation of T cells, 
B cells, and NK cells ; 
• Tumor growth inhibition in murine xenograft models and induction of splenic 
CD8+  lymphocytes in combination with an anti -CTLA -4 mAb ; 
• Induction of IFN -α and IP -[ADDRESS_960832] been conducted with systemic administration of IMO -2125; both 
studies were conducted in patients wit h HCV infection . IMO -2125 was administered s.c. at 
dosages  up to 0.48 mg/kg/week  in 96 patients . Full details are provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . The most common adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate flu -like symptoms and 
injection site react ions (ISRs). 
4.6. Rationale for Study Design and Selection of Dose  
This study will be a 2 -part study  with two treatment arms.  The primary objective of Phase 1 is to 
characterize the safety and determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMO -2125 when 
administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707176].  The maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD )/RP2D for IMO -2125 may differ between the combination of IMO -2125 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707177] -2125 and pembrolizumab. The primary objective of Phase 2 is  to 
assess preliminary clinical activity of each combination at the respective RP2D(s) in patients 
with metastatic melanoma that is not responsive to PD -1 inhibitor thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], using  Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  v1.1 (R ECIST ; Eisenhauer, 2009) .

    4.6.1. Rationale for t his Phase 1/[ADDRESS_960833] of TLR9 , 
stimulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems, and induces the expression of an array 
of endogenous cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1β, IL -6, IL -12, IFN-α, IFN -γ, IP-10, 
TNF -α, and MCP -1. In preclinical studies IMO -2125 has shown dose -dependent anti tumor 
activity associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment, increased T -cell infiltration, 
and induction of durable, tumor -specific memory. In combination with anti -CTLA -4 or 
anti-PD-1, IMO -2125 has shown greater anti tumor activity tha n with either agent alone. 
Therefore , the combination of IMO -2125 with either ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707178] a 
novel therapy to benefit patients with metastatic melanoma.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for I ntratumoral I njection  of IMO -[ADDRESS_960834] shown limited activity as cancer therapeutics 
alone or in combinations with other agents (Smit h, 2014; Chan, 2015). Poor clinical responses 
after intravenous ( i.v.) administration may be due, in part, to the fact that activated T  cells f ailed 
to migrate to the tumor (Lou, 2011). Ea rly studies by [CONTACT_707247] (2009) , showed that agonists of 
TLR9 were most effective when administered in close proximity to tumor antigens, and that i.v. 
and s.c. routes of TLR9 agonist administration were less eff ective than peri -tumoral injections 
(den Brok, 2004; Baines and Celis 2003; Heckel smiller, 2002).  
In preclinical models, intratumoral IMO -2125 administration leads to a dose -dependent decrease 
in treated and distant tumor volume, increase in infiltrating C D8+ T cells, and specific cytotoxic 
T cell responses against tumor antigens which are associated with durable tumor specific 
immune memory. Intratumoral IMO -2125 administration modulates the tumor 
microenvironment by [CONTACT_707248] -infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) and by 
[CONTACT_707249]. The combination of intratumoral IMO -2125 and an 
anti-CTLA -4 mAb resulted in improved inhibition of tumor growth, regression of systemic lung 
metastases and infiltration of TILs versus monotherapy with either agent. The combination of 
intratumoral IMO -2125 with an anti -PD-1 antibody also showed more potent antitumor activity 
than either agent alone (Wang CRI -CIMT -EATI -AACR M eeting, 2015; Wang, 
AACR -NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, 
2015) .  
4.6.2. Rationale for Population  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_707179], only a small minority of patients 
experience dramatic clinical benefit from any of the available immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_707180] . 
The combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707181], but at 
the expense of significant additive toxicity, and median survival is still less than a year (Larkin , 
2015). Thus, new treatment approaches that build on the now -established proof of concept for 
immunotherapy are sorely needed . Patients who relapse after treatment with a PD -[ADDRESS_960835] a particular unmet need since no therapy has been shown to be effective in this setting .

evaluate preliminary efficacy and to generate addition al long -term safety follow  up data.

These patients received dosages  ranging from 0.04 to 0.48 mg/kg. Based on this prior human 
safety experience, a dosage  of 0.08 mg/kg was selected as the start ing dose and then set as a 
fixed dose by [CONTACT_7702] a conservative  patient weight of 60 kg for a calculated starting dose level 
of 4.8 mg. A lower dose level was selected as the fixed starting dose level (4  mg) as an added 
safety margin.  
IMO -[ADDRESS_960837] 3 weeks of 
Cycle 1 , followed by [CONTACT_707234] 5, 8, 11, 17, 23, and 29 (Day 1 of 
Cycles  2 through 7). Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195679] a  90-minute  i.v. infusion at 3  mg/kg 
once every [ADDRESS_960838] label , after which continued administration is at the discretion of the 
Investigator  for patients in the IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab treatment arm. P atients who initiated 
treatment at the 2  mg/kg dose may continue treatment using either the 200  mg dose or the 
2 mg/kg dose . If institution al practice requires certain patients to be treated using weight -based 
pembrolizumab dosing, those patients may be treated with the 2 mg/kg dose.  
Pembrolizumab safety compares favorably to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Robert, 2015), thus dosing of

    8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overview  
This is a  two arm, open- label  Phase 1/[ADDRESS_960854] 
experienced symptomatic or confirmed radiographic progression during or after treatment with 
an anti -PD-(L)1 agent ( alone or in combination) will be eligible. Prior BRAF or MEK inhibi tor 
treatment is not required. The study will be conducted in two  parts : a dose -escalation portion 
(Phase 1) to evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple dose levels and a Phase 2 portion to 
assess preliminary efficacy .  
8.1.1. Phase 1  
The Phase 1 portion of the stu dy will explore escalating dose levels  of IMO -2125 ( from 4 to 
32 mg  with de -escalation to 2 mg allowed  for each IMO -2125 combination). For each cohort, 
IMO -2125 will be administered as a once- weekly  intratumoral injection for 3 cons ecutive weeks  
in Cycle  1, followed by [CONTACT_707253] 5, 8, 11, 17, 23, and 29 ( Day 1 of 
Cycles 2 through 7) . Both ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707187] 3  weeks beginning Day 1 of Cycle 1 Week 2. Continued pembrolizumab dosing following 
the study period is permitted at the discretion of the In vestigator  for patients in the IMO -2125 +

    Each cohort will  be monitored for the occurrence of DLTs . The DLT  evaluation period will be 
Cycle 1  (Weeks 1 through 4) . If a patient discontinues study participation before the DLT 
evaluation period is finished due to reasons other than experiencing a DLT, that patient m ust be 
replaced so that the cohort may be properly evaluated . More information about the review of 
DLTs and the escalation of dose levels between cohorts is provided in Section  8.1.3, 
Section  8.1.4, and  Section  8.1.5. 
There are 3 patients planned per cohort. During Phase 1 , the Sponsor will assign patients to a 
treatment arm ( IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707188] -2125 + pembrolizumab) by [CONTACT_9084]. 
The Sponsor will m aintain a prioritization schedule for cohort assignment in a separate 
document. A Cohort Review Committee (CRC) will be convened prior to each dose level 
escalation to review the available data and provide recommendations on st udy conduct. After 
completing  the DLT evaluations for all planned IMO -[ADDRESS_960857]  v1.1, of IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] , IMO -2125 +  pembrolizumab, and any additional

(as defined in Section  16.2) and up to 20 patients in the secondary IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707189] -evaluable population. 
In the IMO -2125 + pembro lizumab Phase 2 cohort, enrollment will continue until 21  patients in 
the IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab efficacy -evaluable population have been treated at the 
IMO -2125 + pembrolizumab RP2D .  
Phase [ADDRESS_960859] one efficacy evaluation for reasons 
other than toxicity, then that patient will be replaced with the replacement  assigned to the same 
treatment arm and dose level as the patient who dropped out  early.

A charter will be used to guide the CRC’s decision- making.  
Additionally, if, due to observed toxicity, it proves difficult to provide IMO -[ADDRESS_960860] treatment cycle of 
each cohort ( Section  8.1.5). Using a prior beta(1,1) distribution of the DLT rate δ  i for each dose 
level i, the MTD is defined as the highest dose level  for which the mean of the posterior 
distribution of toxicity is closest to but less than 25% among all the evaluated doses i for which 
Pr (δ i > 0.25 | data)  <0.80. 
The RP2D (s) will be selected from  dose level (s) at or below the MTD. Additional dose levels  
may be studie d if the MTD(s) have not been reached and pharmacodynamic activity is deemed to 
be inadequate.  At the time of completion of the Phase 1 portion of the study , an analysis of the 
data will be performed .

the overall toxicity rate for a treatment, a Phase 2 arm will terminate if the Pr (δ t > 0.25 | data) 
>0.80, where δ t is the DLT rate attributable to the treatment. The decision rule for terminating 
due to toxicity is presented in Table 6. The method used to produce the decision rule and 
operating characteristics was designed by [CONTACT_203320] ( 2006) .

review all safety data and decide whether DLTs were observed . Based on the CRC’s 
adjudication of DLTs observed in a cohort, they  will guide deci sions on the dose level that the 
subsequent cohort will be administered.  
A review of all relevant available data will occur  between the Sponsor and participating 
Institution(s) at least monthly for the duration of the study .  
8.1.5. Definition of Dose -limiting T oxicities  
Toxicity will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for AEs  (CTCAE ) v4.03 toxicity criteria.  Dose -limiting toxicities are 
defined as those events that will require dose modification; therefore, D LT criteria should be 
referenced throughout the Phase 1 and 2 portions  of the study. The DLT  evaluation period will 
be Cycle  1 (Weeks 1 through 4) . 
For the purpose s of dose level escalation and determination of the MTD (s), only DLTs (as 
defined below) that  occur during the first  cycle  of treatment will be considered in decision s 
regarding dose level escalation ; however, DLTs or other clinically significant toxicities that 
occur throughout the observation period will be considered when determining the RP2D(s ) for 
use in this trial and in subsequent clinical trials . 
During Cycle 1  of the dose escalation portion, if two  of the three patients in a cohort experience 
the same Grade 2, treatment -related AE, then subsequent increases in dose level will proceed in 
increments less than 100%. If more than one  cohort is trea ted at the same dose level and greater 
than 67% of patients treated at that dose level experience the same Grade 2 treatment -related AE  
(Table 7) , dose level escalation will proceed in increments less than 100%. In such a case, 
specific dose level increments will be decided by [CONTACT_10186].  
Protocol -defined hematologic DLTs include:  
• CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days ; 
• CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever ≥ 38.5°C ;  
• CTCAE Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding;  
• CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  ≥7 days . 
Protocol -defined non- hematologic DLTs include: 
• Grade ≥ 3 vomiting or nausea ≥ 14 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_58348] -emetic 
treatments ; 
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea ≥ 14 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_58348] -diarrheal treatments  which 
should include infliximab as per institutional guidelines ; 
• Serum creatinine > 3.[ADDRESS_960863] ;

    • AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_960864];  in patients with liver metastasis who entered the study with 
Grade [ADDRESS_960865] or ALT increase ≥50% relative to baseline

− Isolated, asymptomatic elevations in biochemistry laboratory values lasting 
≤14 days.  This includes  electrolyte abnormalities that respond to medical 
intervention. 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -related DLTs:  
• Grade ≥ 4 immune -mediated dermatitis (except skin reaction at site of injection) ; 
• Grade ≥ 3 immune -mediated endocrinopathy (with the exception of  Grade 3 
autoimmune thyroiditis that resolves to Grade 1 or ba seline within 28 days of onset) ; 
• Grade ≥ 3 immune -mediated enterocolitis ;

pneumonitis that are considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study 
therapy as  determined by [CONTACT_737] ; 
• Any persistent IMO -2125- related toxicity that lead s to a delay of scheduled (per 
standard of care) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] > 14 days . 
Pembrolizumab -related DLTs:  
• Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis ;  
• Grade ≥ 3 nephritis ;  
• Grade ≥ 3 infusion- related reactions ;  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of prednisone or equivalent 
per day within 12 weeks ; 
• Any Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_960869] be  assessed for attribution based on the known toxicity profiles for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
pembrolizumab, and IMO -2125. If assessment can be clearly attributed to one of the drugs in the 
combination, then dosing should be interrupted and the toxicity should be followed until

 Confidential   
    resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline. Treatment with the other agent  may con tinue 
during this time period. If attribution cannot be clearly ascribed to one agent versus the other, 
then both IMO -2125 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (or pembrolizumab) should be stopped and the toxicity 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or return to baseline. If treatment is to be 
resumed, then re -initiation criteria must be met. If the DLT was  clearly related to IMO -[ADDRESS_960870] be administered at a lower dose 
level (a minimum reduction of at least 1 dose level). If the DLT recurs after a dose level 
reduction, then treatment should be discontinued.  
Patients who experience a non -laboratory, IMO -2125- related DLT must be evaluated weekly, at 
a minimum, until resolution to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_960871]. For abnormal laboratory values that 
qualify as DLT s, patients will be followed twice weekly until values return to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_960872].  
Criteria for r e-initiation of study treatment following occurrence of a DLT  are as follow s: 
• ANC must be ≥ 1.5 x 109/L (1500/μL) ; 
• Platelets must be ≥ 75 x 109/L (75,000/μL) ; 
• All clinically significant non -hematologic toxicities for which a causal association to 
study treatme nt cannot be ruled out must be  Grade ≤ 1 (except alopecia) or returned to 
baseline.  
If the patient does not meet these criteria, dosing will be delayed and the patient should be 
re-evaluated with in 48 to 72 hours. If the next cycle is delayed by [CONTACT_726] 21 days  for toxicity , 
the patient should be  removed from study treatment. In these situations, if the patient is 
experiencing clinical benefit and has a favorable risk/benefit profile, study treatment with 
IMO -2125 may be continued if agreed upon by [CONTACT_66229]. 
8.1.6. Safety Assessment for Immunologically Related Toxicity 
Based on an incidence of G rade 3 or greater immune- mediated AEs associated with use of  
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707194] 12% to 15%, the following safety precautions 
will be followed . Examples of relevant toxicities include the followin g: enterocolitis, hepatitis, 
dermatitis, neuropathy, endocrinopathy, nephritis, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, non- infectious 
myocarditis, uveitis , and  iritis.  
During dose level escalation, if any of the following is observed, the CRC will be convened to 
review all safety findings for all patients treated in that cohort and all previous cohorts, including 
those events that occurred beyond C ycle 1, to guide next steps. 
• If more th an one patient experiences a Grade ≥ 3, immune -related adverse event 
(irAE) in a coho rt of 3 patients;  
• If more than  two patients experience a Grade ≥ 3 irAE in cohorts of 6 patients.   
During the P hase 2 portion of the trial, if the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 irAEs  observed in C ycle 1 or 
in subsequent cycles of treatment exceeds 2 5%, the CRC will be convened to review all safety 
findings from all patients treated in the study to guide next steps.

10.1. IMO -2125 
IMO -2125, a novel phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide , is composed of two  strands of 
modified DNA joined at the 3’ ends. IMO -2125 is a hygroscopic whit e to off -white amorphous 
solid obtained by [CONTACT_27197]; it is highly soluble in aqueous media.  
IMO -2125 will be administered by [CONTACT_707257] (between 2 and 32 mg ; 
refer to Section  8.1).  
IMO -[ADDRESS_960881], each 5- mL glass vial contains IMO -2125 sodium 
salt equivalent to 25 mg/vial of IMO -[ADDRESS_960882] contains no 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_707196] . For the aqueous sterile solution, each vial contains IMO -2125 
sodium salt equivalent to 8 mg/mL of IMO -2125 free acid compounded with 0.9% sodi um 
chloride.

Pembrolizumab will be provided by [CONTACT_707258].  
10.4. Drug Handling and Administration  
10.4.1. Drug Delivery to Site  
After the research site has submitted all approved regulatory and study start -up documents, Idera 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will initiate a requisition for IMO -2125 to be delivered to the site via its 
distribution facility.  All IMO -2125 shipments are sent at 2°C  to 8°C . Upon receipt, the 
pharmacist or appropriate technician/designee must inspect the contents, verify temperature 
conditions, and confirm receipt of goods . Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707198].  
Drug inventory will be maintained by [CONTACT_779]. The site must inform Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , 
in writing, by [CONTACT_6972],  or e-mail of additional study drug needs at least 2 weeks  befo re the 
required receipt date.  
10.4.2. Drug Storage

10.4.3. Administration  
[IP_ADDRESS]. IMO -2125 
IMO -2125 will be administered to each patient at one of five dose levels : 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg . 
IMO -2125 will be  administered as a series of intratumoral injections administered as per  Table 4. 
Patients will remain at the study site for observation for a minimum of 30 minutes  following 
each administration of IMO -2125. A single tumor should be selected for injection throughout the 
study and designated as the “injected tumor” on the appropriate CRF.  
The injected tumor will be selected from (in order  of priority) pathologic draining lymph nodes, 
superficial or s.c. metastases, or deep (visceral) metastases, the latter requiring interventional 
radiology support. A separate (i.e., “noninjected”) tumor lesion should be identified as the distant 
lesion to  be biopsied  (optional in Phase 2)  and recorded on the CRF. Note that tumor biopsies 
should be done prior to study treatment administration. If a full dose can no longer be practically 
administered into the designated tumor for injection, another tumor may  be selected.  In the event 
that complete tumor regression occurs in all accessible lesions prior to completion of therapy, 
any remaining IMO -2125 doses should be administered into the tumor bed, except in the case of 
visceral lesions where remaining doses should be given s.c. to minimize procedural risks. 
The assigned dose of IMO -2125 will be administered into the “injected tumor” by [CONTACT_707259]. It is recommended that 
the tumors be injected with 25- gauge  needle; however, the choice of needle will be at the 
Investigator’s discretion. IMO -2125 should be thoroughly distributed within the injected tumor 
while avoiding necrotic areas, with a fanning method (spread the injection across several angles 
throughout the lesions, to maximize the IMO -2125  in the injected lesion) .  
The total injec ted dose should remain constant;  however , injection volume may need to be 
adjusted if the “injected tumor” decreases in size (see the Phar macy Manual for more details).  In 
the event a full dose can no longer be practically administered into the “injected tumor ,” another 
lesion may be selected.

    11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
11.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events should be assessed continuously throughout the study and recorded on the eCRF . 
Reporting during the follow -up phase of the study should be limited to Grade ≥3 AEs, associated 
concomitant medications, and serious adverse events ( SAEs ; see Table 1 and Table 2).  
11.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence temporally associated with the use of a medical 
product in a patient, whether or not  the event is conside red causally related to the medical 
product.1 An AE can be a new occurrence or an existing process that increases significantly in 
intensity or frequency .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is serious  when the patient outcome is one or more of the following:  
• Death.  
• Life-threatening, meaning that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the 
event at the time that the event occurred . It does not include an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], initial or prolonged, meaning that a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or 
prolongation of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58360], or occurred 
as a consequence of the event . It does not include a pre -planned elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707214], or, in general, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58362] 24 hours duration.  
• Disability or incapacity that is persistent or significant.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Important medical event  that, although not immediately  life-threatening, requires 
intervention in order to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above . 
Examples of such events are allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home; blood dyscra sias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_960900] in this protocol will hereafter be referred to as study drug (synonym: investigational agent).

 Confidential   
    [IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is defined as an SAE that meets both  the following criteria with respect to study drug:  
• Suspected  — is assessed as related or possibly related to study drug (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]);  
• Unexpected  — compared to the study drug -related AEs described in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, the event meets any  of the following criteria:  
− The event was not previously described;  
− The event is now characterized as more severe (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]);  
− The event is now characterized more specifically (e.g., an event of “interstitial 
nephritis” in a patient receiving an agent previously described as associated with 
“acute renal failure”).  
In clinical trials involvin g ill patients, events considered related to the natural history of the 
disease under study or to lack of efficacy (that is, the event is considered more likely related to 
those factors than to other factors, including study drug) are not considered "unexpected."  Lack 
of efficacy is recorded as specified elsewhere in the Protocol.  
11.1.2. Recording Adverse Events  
Procedures for the collection and recording of AEs are as follows:  
• From obtaining informed consent through the SFU  Visit, there will be active 
surveillance to identify all AEs. Events will be recorded in the AE portion of the 
electronic data capture ( EDC ), with particular attention to whether the onset of the 
event was before or after the administration of the first dose of study drug . All 
recorded event s will be included in applicable line listings, but only events with onset 
after administration of the first dose will be included in summaries of 
treatment -emergent AEs .  
• After the end of study, surveillance will be passive (only events brought to the 
Investigator’s attention will be considered) and only events assessed as S[LOCATION_003]Rs will 
be recorded (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• In accordance with the FDA gu idance document – Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence (BA/BE) 
Studies – disease progression does not require reporting as an AE or SAE. However, 
signs and symptoms related to disease may be reported at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
11.1.3. Characterizing Adverse Events  
For each AE recorded the following characteristics will be noted .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Description of Event  
The diagnosis or description will be as specific and complete as possible (i.e., “lower extremity 
edema,” rather than just “edema”) . Whenever possible, signs and symptoms due to a common 
IMO -2125  Page 69 of 106 
Protocol 2125- 204, Version 8.0 Date: 27 M arch 2018  
   
 Confidential   
    etiology will be reported as an integrated diagnosis; for example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, 
sore throat and head congestion would be reported as “upper r espi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].”  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Date and Time of Onset  
The date and time at which the event was first apparent  will be recorded, if known. The time of 
onset of symptoms may be appreciably earlier than the date and time the Investigator becomes 
aware of the event. Some events may be apparent to the patient and Investigator independently, 
and information from each may contribute to the final report. For example, a patient may report 
the onset of a rash two days prior to  being seen by a physician who makes a diagnosis  of herpes 
zoster based on appearance and laboratory confirmation. In that case, there is a single AE, with 
the date of onset based on the date of the initial observation by [CONTACT_5363] a specific 
description (herpes zoster) based on the clinical exam and tests .     
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to Study Drug  
This determination is based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the likelihood that 
the study drug caused the AE and may include consideration of some or all of the following 
factors:  
• Alternative pos sible causes of the AE, including the patient’s underlying disease or 
co-morbid conditions, other drugs, other host and environmental factors.  
• Temporal sequence between the exposure to study drug and the AE.  
• Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestatio ns of the AE are consistent with known 
actions or toxicity of the study drug.  
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose level or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35620] (i.e., dechallenge); or recurred or worsened with re -exposure to the drug 
(i.e., re challenge).  
The relationship between the study drug and the AE will be described using one of the following 
categories:  
• Related — the study drug is more likely the cau se of the AE than other factors.  
• Possibly related  — there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug is the cause of 
the AE, including that the study drug and another factor(s) are equa lly likely as 
causes of the AE.  
• Unlikely related  — another factor is considered more likely  the cause of the AE than 
the study drug.  
• Not related  — another factor is considered to be the cause of the AE.  
Related and possibly related AEs may result during the use of the study drug as planned (per 
protocol), or from abuse, withdrawal or over -dosage of the agent.

The following list of AEs, which have been associated with the use of immunotherapy agents, 
will be considered to be immune -related and should be considered as such unless another 
etiology can be clearly established:

• Any AEs that the Investigator considers to be of autoimmune or immune -related 
origin (those AE terms designated as such in the eCRF).  
Immune -related AEs will be summarized in the clinical study report.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
The severity of clinical AEs (i.e., symptoms reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or signs observed by [CONTACT_3786]) will be assessed using the guidelines summarized in Table 7 based on CTCAE 
v4.03 criteria.

    [IP_ADDRESS]. Grading of Laboratory Safety Tests for Reporting and Analysis  
Treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory results will be handled as follows:  
• Graded using NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03 criteria  
• Assessed as potential DLT events based on pre -specified criteria (see Section  8.1.5)  
• Reported as AEs when assessed as clinically significant ( “CS”)  using the procedures 
and criteria detailed in Section  11.1.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Study Drug upon Occurrence of an Adverse Event  
For each AE the Investigator will indicate which one of the following actions regarding the 
administration of study drug was taken because of that AE:  
• Discontinued  — study drug was stopped permanently due to the AE.  
• Dosing Interrupted  — study drug regimen was modified by [CONTACT_139670], 
i.e., 1 or more doses were not administered, but drug was not stopped permanently.  
• Dose Decreased  — study dr ug regimen was modified by [CONTACT_58413], i.e., by 
[CONTACT_139671], strength or amount. 
• None  — no change in the administration of study mediation.  
For patients whose treatment is paused and then resumed at a lower dose level due to events such 
as DLTs (see Section  8.1.5), the management of study drug will be recorded as “Dose 
Decreased.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Actions Taken for Management of Adverse Event  
Adverse ev ents will be followed and managed by [CONTACT_737], including obtaining any 
supplemental studies needed to define the nature and/or cause of the event (e.g., laboratory tests, 
diagnostic procedures, consultation with other health care professionals).  
For each AE the Investigator will categorize as follows the actions taken to manage the AE:  
• Concomitant medication — one  or more medications (prescription or 
over-the-counter) were started or increased in dose; non- medication actions may also 
have been ordered.  
• Other action — only  non- medication action(s) were ordered as management of the 
AE (e.g., bed placed in Trendelenburg position, warm compresses applied to access 
site).  
• No action — no actions were ordered for management of the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up and Outcome of Adverse Events  
If possible, AEs will be followed until resolved (synonyms: recovered, recuperated, ended) either 
with or without sequelae, including for patients who prematurely discontinue study participation. 
For AEs that are asses sed as not drug- related and are not resolved at the end -of-study visit, 
follow -up may be limited with the approval of the Medical Monitor.

 Confidential   
    The outcome of each event will be described using the following categories:  
• Resolved without sequelae — the event r esolved and patient returned to baseline.  
• Resolved with sequelae — the event resolved but the patient is left with residual 
problems (e.g., functional deficits, pain).  
• Resolving  — at the last observation, the event was improving.  
• Not Resolved  — at the l ast observation, the event was unchanged.  
• Death  (Fatal)  — to be used for the one  AE which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, was the primary  cause of death.  
• Unknown  — there were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report) 
of the ev ent.  
Note: Resolving and Not Resolved may also be used for AEs that were unresolved at the time a 
patient died, but were not  assessed as the primary cause of death.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Date and Time of Outcome  
For each class of outcome as defined above,  Table  8 indicates the date and time to be recorded. 
As discussed in detail for date/time of onset (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), determining the date/time an 
event resolved (ended) should reflect the type of event and the source of the information.

    [IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
The initial notification  of each SAE will be entered into the EDC system within 24 hours  of the 
time the Investigator (or the Investigator's designee) becomes aware that the event has occurred . 
The following items will be entered into the appropriate EDC sec tion (any items not available 
should be explicitly noted):  
• Protocol number, study site, patient number.  
• Investigator’s name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031] (phone, email).  
• Description of the event (i.e., date and time of onset, initial assessment, treatments 
and course).  
• Current status of the patient and the event.  
• Criteria by [CONTACT_58418].  
• Date of the first injection of study drug.  
• Date of the last injection of study drug prior to the event.  
• Assessment of relationship of study drug to the event.  
• Whether the study drug was discontinued or adjusted as a result of the event.  
The following  additional information will be entered within 2 days for death and life -threatening 
events and wi thin 4 day s for all other SAEs:  
• Narrative summary of the event — to include specific information that will assist in 
understanding the event, e.g., relevant medical history, co -morbid conditions, 
physical exam, diagnostics, assessment, treatments (including concomitant 
medications), response to treatment, course, and outcome (if known);  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58365] — including diagnostic procedures 
(e.g.,  laboratory, ECG, x -ray), surgical procedures, and consultations.  
Additional documentation may be submitted  as part of a follow -up report.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Reportable Events  
Certain events that occur in the absence of an AE should be reported to the Sponsor. These 
include the following:  
• Pregnancy exposure (patient becomes pregnant while taking study drug). Should a 
female patient or partner of a male patient become pregnant during the study, the 
patient will inform the Investigator. The patient will be asked to follow up with the 
study site to report the eventual outcome of the pregnancy. The information will be 
tracked by  [CONTACT_1034].  
• Lactation exposure (patient was taking study drug while nursing an infant).  
• Accidental exposure (someone other than the patient was exposed to study drug).  
• Overdose (patient received more than the prescribed dose of study drug within a 
given timeframe).

    • Other medication errors that potentially place patients at greater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized (e.g., study drug was administered via incorrect 
route).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Requirements for Expedited and Periodic Reporting of Adverse Events  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions are required to be reported rapi[INVESTIGATOR_58366] /ECs  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 7 days for fatal or life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs; within 
15 days for all other S[LOCATION_003]Rs) . The Sponsor and the Invest igator will work together to meet 
these reporting requirements.

for all blood sampling will be provided in a separate study manual and kits.  
13.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
The plasma PK of single -dose IMO -2125 and the PK of repeat -dose IMO -2125 administered by 
[CONTACT_707238][INVESTIGATOR_707216]. The following parameters will be determined for IMO -2125 plasma PK , 
if appropriate : 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time of C max (tmax) 
• Area under the curve from [ADDRESS_960901] measurable plasma concentration (AUC 0-t) 
Serum concentrations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707153] 2, 5, 8, 11, 
17, and 23. For patients who continue pembrolizumab treatment, pembrolizumab pre -dose PK 
samples should be collected before dosing at all visits. A post -dose pembrolizumab PK sample 
should be collected [ADDRESS_960902] 20 patients  treated at the IMO -2125 RP2D after which the Sponsor will determine if 
additional samples are needed.  The Sponsor will then inform the Investigators whether or not to 
continue collecting plasma concentration samples.  
The relationship between PK assessments, safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics variables will 
be explored whenever possible. 
13.2. Pharmacodynamic Markers of Immune Response  
For Phase 1, biopsies of the injected tumor will be performed at the Screening Visit (within 
[ADDRESS_960903] treatment); within 24 to 48 hours after IMO -2125 injection on Week 1 
(Cycle  1); Week  2 (Cycle 1; optional) ; during Week 8 (Cycle 3) ; and opt ionally  at Week 13 
(Cycle 4) and  at the time of disease progression or during Week 23, whichever is later. Tumor 
biopsies of the designated non- injected lesion will be performed at Screening , prior to the first 
dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707133] (optional ), and during Week 8. For Phase 2, tumor 
biopsies are optional at all specified visits.  Surgical methods (e.g., punch or core) are preferred 
over FNA where feasible.  
For those patients who have liver or other visceral metastases injected with IMO -2125, rep eat 
biopsy of liver or other visceral tumor lesions may not always be possible. Therefore, repeat 
biopsies will be performed only when feasible in these patients . Note that tumor biopsies should 
be done prior to study treatment administration. 
The Week 8 ( Cycle 3) and Week 13 (Cycle 4) biopsies may be performed within a ±3  day 
window. If tumor response is observed early during initial treatment, the Week 8 biops ies may

• Any potential association between these biomarkers and antitumor activity  
• Gene profiling (with RNA and DNA extraction)  
• Immunogenicity (antibodies to IMO -2125, ip ilimumab , or pembrolizumab)  
13.2.1. Immunogeni city Analyses  
Exploratory  analyses will include assessing the occurrence of antibodies to the administered 
oligonucleotide  (anti -IMO -2125 antibodies) , as well as antibodies to the administered 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707217] (refer to Table 1 and Table 2).  
13.2.2. Immunologic Evaluations  
Immunologic evaluations will include , but not be limited to : 
• Immunophenot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_707218]  (on biopsies from patients enrolled in the 
Phase 1 portion) ;

    14. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
14.1. Tumor Response  
Tumor response will be assessed using immune -related response criteria ( irRC ) and 
RECIST  v1.[ADDRESS_960905] v1.1 in Phase 2 ( Section  21.2, 
Section  21.4, and Section  21.3,  respectively). Efficacy evaluation should include clinical 
examination and CT or magnetic resonance imaging scanning of known sites of disease. 
Ultrasound studies performed for needle biopsy localiz ation or IMO -2125 dosing should not be 
used to assess tumor status (in accordance with RECIST  v1.1). The same method(s) of 
assessment should be used throughout the study for consistency wherever feasible. Response 
should be assessed at Weeks 8, 17, and [ADDRESS_960906] every 3 months thereafter until 
progression or start of a new anti -cancer therapy (see Section  8.2.2). Response assessments of 
CR, PR, a nd progressive disease must be confirmed by [CONTACT_9661] ≥4 weeks after the initial 
documentation of response.

    15. ASSESSMENT OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES 
15.1. EORTC QLQ-C30 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is an integrated system for assessing the health -related qualit y of life 
(QoL)  of cancer patients participating in inte rnational clinical trials. The EORTC has adopted a 
modular approach to QoL assessment, consisting of a core questionnaire to be administered, if 
necessary with a module specific to tumor site, treatment modality, or  a QoL dimension 
(Aaronson, 1993).  
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is the product of more than a dec ade of collaborative research. It is a 
questionnaire for patient self -completion, composed of multi -item and single -item measures . 
These include 5 functional scales (phys ical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), 3 symptom 
scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pa in) and a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single 
items (dyspn ea, insomnia, appe tite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) 
(Aarons on, 1993).  
All of the scales and single -item measures  range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score 
repre sents a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a 
high/ healthy level of functioning, a high score  for the global  health status/QoL represents a high 
QoL, but a  high score for a symptom scale /item represents a high level of 
symptomatology /problems. 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 will be administered to all subjects according to the Schedule of 
Evaluations ( Table 1 and Table 2). To minimize bias in the PRO data, the PRO assessments 
should be completed before study drug administration and AE assessments.

Please refer to Section  8.1.3 for the rules around dose level escalation and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
16.1. Determination  of Sample Size  
The primary objective of Phase 2 is to assess the preliminary clinical activity , defined as the 
investiga tor-assessed ORR, of IMO -2125 in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707158] -2125 in 
combination with  pembrolizumab in patients with progression on or following PD -(L)1 inhibitor  
therapy for metastatic melanoma. Given that two primary hypotheses are being tested  (regarding 
the ORR of IMO -2125 and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707159] -2125 and pembr olizumab), a 
Bonferroni correction has been applied to the alpha to control the  Type I error  rate for the trial . 
Assuming the ORR for patients who receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707160] 11% (the historical 
response rate in patients who are PD -1 inhibitor naïve), and a target  ORR of 35% for patients 
who receive  the IMO -2125 + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_707161], a  sample size of 21 patients 
would achieve 77 % power to detect a 24% diff erence in response rates using a one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.

error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_960907] the alternative of at leas t 35% . 
With this method, [ADDRESS_960908] v1.1 response, then the null hypothesis H o will be rejected in favor of 
the alternative H a. In this treatment arm, this design has statistical power of 77%, an expected 
sample size of 13.[ADDRESS_960909] stage of 69.7% if the response proportion is ≤0.11.  
At least 60  patients  may be enrolled in this arm , including the 21 ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naïve  patients who  
will be used to tes t the null hypothesis . These 60 patients will include those with primary 
exposure to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] . The purpose of treating ~[ADDRESS_960910]  is to improve the precision of the ORR estimate in the primary efficac y 
population and to allow preliminary assessment of safety and preliminary efficacy in the 
population with prior exposure to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. The 95% exact confidence intervals for a range of 
sample sizes for an ORR of at least 0.35 is in Table 10.

the study, including assurance that the study meets the regulatory requirements. In this study, 
Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will have certain direct responsibilities and will delegate other 
responsibilities to  the designated CRO . The CRO will ensure adherence to the Sponsor ’s general 
responsibilities and other responsibilities as agreed between the designated CRO and Idera 
Pharmaceuti cals, Inc., e.g., selection of I nvestigators, monitoring, and protocol amendments . 
19.2. Informed Consent  
The I nvestigator has both ethical and legal responsibili ty to ensure that each patient being 
considered for inclusion in this study is given a full explanation of the study. Written informed 
consent will be obtained from all patients (or their guardians or legal representatives) before any 
study -related procedu res (including any pre -treatment procedures, such as pre- procedure 
sedation) are performed or given.  
Written informed consent will be document ed on an ICF  approved by [CONTACT_78626] /EC 
responsible for approval of this protocol. The ICF will conform to ICH G CP guidelines and to 
the institutional requirements for informed consent a nd applicable regulations. The I nvestigator 
agrees to obtain approval from Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of any ICF intended for use in the 
study, prior to submission for IRB /EC approval.  
The consent form will be reviewed with the prospective study patient or his or her  legal 
representative, and the I nvestigator or qualified designee will be available to answer questions 
regarding procedures, risks, and alternatives.  
Once the ap propriate essential information has been provided to the pati ent and fully explained 
by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or qualified designee, and it is felt that the patient understands the 
implications of participating, the patient and the I nvestigator or designee will  sign and date the 
IRB/EC-approved written ICF. The patient will receive a copy of the signed ICF. The original 
signed and dated ICF will be kept in the site’s regulatory file. Documentation of the patient’s 
informed consent for and participation in this s tudy will be noted in the patient’s medical record.  
If the patient is illiterate, an impartial witness is required to be present during the entire informed 
consent reading and discussion. Afterward, the patient should be asked to sign and date the ICF, 
if capable. The impartial witness should also sign and date the ICF along with the individual who 
read and discussed the informed consent (i.e., study staff personnel).  
The patient or his or her legally acceptable representative will be informed in a timely manner if 
new information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue 
IMO -2125  Page 92 of 106 
Protocol 2125- 204, Version 8.0 Date: [ADDRESS_960924] that ensures the 
information can always be tracked back to the source data. For this purpose, a unique patient 
identification code (ID number and patient name [CONTACT_104846]) will be used that allows ident ification of 
all data reported for each patient.  
Patient information collected in this study will comply with the standards for protection of 
privacy of individually identifiable health information as promulgated in the Health Insurance 
Portability and Acc ountability Act ( HIPAA ) and as mandated in 45 CFR 160 and 164. All 
records will be kept confidential and the patient’s name [CONTACT_546161]. Patient 
records will not be released to anyone other than Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its desig nees, and 
responsible regulatory authorities, when requested. In all cases, caution will be exercised to 
assure the data are treated confidentially and that the patient’s privacy is guaranteed.  
19.4. Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health 
Infor mation  
An authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) under the HIPAA 
Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.102 et seq) will be obtained from every study  patient before, or at the 
time of, enrollment. It will be presented to, and signed b y, the patient at  the same time as the 
ICF. The I nvestigator is responsible for obtaining patients’ (or their legal representatives’) 
authorizations and signatures and for explaining the elements of the HIPAA authorization form if 
necessary.  
The HIPAA auth orization may be either a separate form or included in the study ICF, dependent 
upon local requirements. If a separate HIPAA document is signed, the Investigator will append 
one signed original of each executed HIPAA authorization to the study  patient’s signed ICF and 
file it in the site’s regulatory file. If a second copy of the signed ICF is filed in the patient’s 
medical records, an additional copy of the signed HIPAA authorization form will be appended. 
Patients will be given the other signed duplicate for their personal records.  
The HIPAA authorization form will contain all elements required under the HIPAA Privacy 
Rule. By [CONTACT_2371], site IRB /EC approval of the Sponsor -provided authorization form for use in this 
study is not required, and no such approval wi ll be sought or requested. However, Idera 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., upon request, will provide advance copi[INVESTIGATOR_707226] H IPAA authorization 
form to the I nvestigator or the site’s privacy board or privacy official and will work with the site 
to eliminate any conc erns.  
The I nvestigator or the site will promptly inform Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of any restrictions 
on the use or disclosure of PHI of any pa tient to which the site or the I nvestigator have agre ed 
under the Privacy Rule. The I nvestigator or the site will also promptly inform Idera 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of any written revocation of any patient’s HIPAA authorization.

    21.2. Immune -Related Response Criteria (irRC)  
During Phase 1, subject management and response assessments will be performed according to 
irRC (Wolchok, 2009) .  
Appendix  Table  1: Overall Response using irRC:  
Response assessment  Description  
irCR  Complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or 
not, and no new lesions)  
Confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment 
≥[ADDRESS_960931] documentation  
irPR Decrease in tumor burden ≥50% relative to baseline  
Confirmed by a consecutive assessment ≥ [ADDRESS_960932] documentation  
irSD  Not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD . 
A change in tumor burden of neither 50% decreas e from 
baseline nor 25% increase from nadir can be determined.  
irPD  Increase in tumor burden ≥25% relative to nadir (minimum 
recorded tumor burden)  
Confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment

Tumors)  
In Phase [ADDRESS_960936] (Nishino, 2013; Bohnsack, 2014). For irRECIST, a unidimensional 
measurement is assessed for the longest diameter of each lesion.  
Target lesion:  ≥[ADDRESS_960937] diameter (target nodal lesion ≥[ADDRESS_960938] diameter), 
representative of the organs involved, and lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. Baseline target lesions are limited to a total of [ADDRESS_960939] shown unequivocal progression after the radiation. 
Non-target lesion:  all other lesions, including small lesions (<[ADDRESS_960940] diameter or 
nodal lesi ons ≥10 mm and <[ADDRESS_960941] diameter) and all truly non -measurable lesions.  
Tumor burden:  the sum of the longest diameters of all baseline target lesions (use shortest 
diameter for target nodal lesions) and all measurable new lesions.  
Appendix  Table  1: Overall Response using irRECIST  
Response assessment  Description  
irCR  • Complete disappearance of all lesions (and no new measurable or 
non-measurable lesions).  
• Pathological lymph nodes (target or non -target) must have 
diameter <10  mm in short axis.  
• Requires confirmation by [CONTACT_707286] ≥[ADDRESS_960942] documentation . 
irPR • ≥30% decrease in tumor burden from baseline.  
• No unequivocal progression of baseline non- target lesions.  
• No unequivocal progression of new, non- measurable lesions. 
• Requires confirmation by [CONTACT_707286] ≥[ADDRESS_960943] documentation . 
irSD  • Not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD . 
irPD  • ≥20% increase in tumor burden from nadir (the minimum 
recorded tumor burden).  
• The presence of new, measurable lesions does not define 
progression. New measurable lesions are added to the assessment 
of tumor burden.  
• A substantial, unequivocal worsening of baseline non- target 
lesions is indicative of irPD.  
• A substantial, unequivocal worsening of new, non -measurable 
lesions is indicative of irPD.  
• Requires confirmation by [CONTACT_707286] ≥[ADDRESS_960944] documentation .

Older adults experiencing emotional distress also report reduced engagement in daily 
activities.  Up to 25% of older adults (age 65+) report symptoms of emotional (e.g., anxiety, 
depressive) disorders which negatively impact their ability to engage in daily activities , and overall 
physical and mental health.  Cognitive -behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (CBT) are well-established  treatments 
for these problems. They can  increase engagement in daily activities by [CONTACT_321085]. However, the demand for mental 
health services among older adults is rising and existing trea tments are insufficient. Existing 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321070] [ADDRESS_396225] patients attend an average of five 
sessions.  Brief treatments are more feasible for older adults to complete. Thus, it is crucial to 
develop brief, evidence -based interventions that can be implemented in community settings for 
older adults experiencing emotional distress to increase their activity. Because it can take 
decades to develop a novel treatment, a strategic approach is to a dapt an existing evidence -
based tre atment for this population.  
 
The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is an 
optimal intervention to adapt for older adults to increase their engagement in daily 
activities.  The UP is an evidence -based CBT. As a transdiagnostic treatment, it can be applied 
across diagnostic categories to address a wide range of presenting problems. The UP contains 
five core skills for increasing activity engagement (Table 1).   
Transdiagnostic treatments, like the UP, are advantageous for dissemination and implementation 
because they are adaptable and reduce clinician training burden.  The UP has demonstrated 
adaptability for underserved patient populations and has been successfully abbreviated to meet 
the needs of unique patient population s. Further, it has been successfully delivered by [CONTACT_321086], increasing its potential for dissemination.  A five-session  version 
of this treatment (UP -5) was devel oped that includes the core skills (Table 1) and showed 
acceptability in adults with acute suicide risk.  The primary aim  of this study was to adapt the UP -Table 1. UP -5 Session -by-Session Content

1 Motivation and Psychoeducation 
about Emotions  Build motivation to increase activity, reduce 
perception that emotions should be avoided . 
2 Breaking Down Emotions and 
Mindfulness  Observe and describe emotional experiences,

[ADDRESS_396226] -delivered versions to identify  the minimum level of intervention needed 
to increase activity in older adults.   
Recruitment.  Patients were recruited from Duke MyChart, ResearchMatch.org, and referrals 
from Duke clinics.  
Screening.  Eligibility was determined before  consent. Patients interested  in completing the study 
were  directed to an online screen in REDCap , which provided more information about the 
research and asked potential participants  to complete self -report questionnaires. Those meeting 
initial eligibility  were contact[CONTACT_5365] a phone screen (also done as an interview in REDCap). After 
online/phone screen, patients were  eligible if they (1) were  age 65+, (2) report ed moderate or 
higher emotional distress (T -score ≥ 60) on the Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS)  emotional distress anxiety OR depression forms, which had been 
used with older adults,  (3) report ed reduced engagement in instrumental daily activities indicated 
by [CONTACT_321087] “8” on the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS),  and (4) were  
willing to engage in telehealth. Patients meeting these criteria by [CONTACT_321088] a first study visit.  
Consent.  Patients completed an electronic consent form in REDCap and pre -treatment 
questionnaires during the first study visit . Participants were  deemed eligible based on the 
screening questions they completed on the REDCap online screen & phone screen. Patients also 
complete d pre-treatment measures at this consent visit: Demographic Data Survey, PSFS, 
PROMIS -anxiety, PROMIS -depression, PROMIS -Physical Function (PF) and the Credibility and 
Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ: Devilly & Borkovec, 2000). We also in cluded the Cognitive 
Flexibility Scale (Martin & Rubin, 1995, CFS), Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire 
(Gamez, et.al , 2013, BEAQ), and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire (Chadwick, et al., 
2008, SMQ) at intake and the [ADDRESS_396227] complete d a Clinical Global 
Impressions -Improvement (CGI -I) rating and document ed how much homework the participant 
completed since the last session (0 -100%). After the fifth session, participants were  reminded to 
track their number of steps ov er the next week. One week later, patients provide d feedback about 
the treatment in exit interviews. Interviews inquire d about modifications needed to develop the 
self-guided UP -5 (e.g., automatic prompts) and whether/how to include a support person (e.g., 
caregiver) in treatment as well as treatment preferences and length of treatment. Patients also 
complete d post-treatment measures at this 1-week  f/u visit: PSFS, PROMIS -anxiety, PROMIS -
depression, PROMIS -PF, CFS, BEAQ, SMQ, and the Credibility and Expecta ncy of Improvement 
Scale (CEIS). They also provide d an electronic form for the interventionist to enter the number of 
steps they had taken over the past week. After each cohort, the UP -[ADDRESS_396228] -delivered treatment, all participants in Phase 2 
underwent  the Virtual Short Physical Performance  Battery (SPPB) before the first online or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321071] [ADDRESS_396229] session. The Short 
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a performance -based test assessing older adults’ 
mobility by [CONTACT_321089], strength, and speed. In this study, we only used  the gait speed 
portion. Performance in this category was scored on a s cale of [ADDRESS_396230] therapy/online 
session. Participants also report ed the number of steps they took daily over the past week before 
their first session. After consenting and before the virtual SPPB, all participants were  mailed a 
pedometer and materials to use for the virtual SPPB (measuring tape and black tape) and for 
those participants in the self -guided therapy arm, they receive d a copy of the self -guided manual 
(uploaded in protocol documents). During each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -delivered  treatment session, starting at 
session 2, the interventionist complete d a Clinical Global Impressions -Improvement (CGI -I) rating . 
It documented  how much homework they thought  the participant completed since the last session 
(0-100%). Outcomes were evaluated pre/post treatment and include d measures of daily activity 
(PSFS), depression (PROMIS -depression), and anxiety (PROMIS -anxiety), CFS, BEAQ, and 
SMQ, and PROMIS -SF. Treatment satisfaction (Client -Satisfaction Questionnaire -8) was 
evaluated post -treatment , the Credibility and Expectancy of Improvement Scale (CEIS) was 
assessed, and  a semi -structured  exit interview as in Phase 1. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_321072] y sessions and an independent coder  rated 10% of completed sessions for  
adherence. Post -Treatment occur red one week after the final therapy or self -guided online 
session , and participants were  reminded to track their number of steps in the [ADDRESS_396231]/trained study team member at 
the 1-week  f/u where they complete d the gait speed test virtually one more time & the semi -
structured exit Interview. The rest of the self -report , including the noted outcomes,  were also  
completed.  
Participants were  allowed to start treatment up to 1  month after the time of consent. For the five 
sessions of UP -5 treatment, there was a minimum of 3 days between therapy sessions and all 
participants complete d the five sessions within 2 months  (~8 weeks). There was an expected 
short delay from the consent visit to the first therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] -delivered or online platform session to allow 
for the pedometer to arrive at the participant and be able to track steps for the [ADDRESS_396232] therapy visi t. Participants in Phase 1 were  in the study approximately 7 -12 weeks. In 
phase 2, participants were in the study for approximately 12 -17 weeks.  
One month F/u (post the [ADDRESS_396233] -treatment  visit- approximately 5 weeks after the final 
online/therapy delivered session ): For Phase 2 participants only, to measure effects over a more 
extended  period, participants again receive d the following outcome measures to complete via 
REDCap CFS, CSQ -8, CEIS, BEAQ, and SMQ, (PSFS), depression (PROMIS -depression), and 
anxiety (PROMIS -anxiety and PROMIS -SF. They were sent an email reminder via REDCap to 
begin tracking their steps for 1 week leading up to the 1-month  f/u final visit. Participants were  
paid $20 for com pleting this 1-month  f/u. 
Of note, i f participants used assisted mobility devices and were enrolled in Phase 1 or 2, they 
could  still participate in the study . They were  not required to do the gait speed and/or pedometer 
assessment. This was not  considered a deviation in the study if not completed.   
Also, if the participant start ed the virtual SPPB mobility assessment and fel t uneasy, 
uncomfortable, unsteady, they were  allowed to stop the SPPB at any time and still be allowed to 
continue in the study. If the participant refuse d to try the SPPB or complete it at the [ADDRESS_396234].  
Remote Self -Guided Therapy Only: An orientation video with instructions and videos for UP 
sessions 1 -5 (corresponding to the sessions in the self -guided manual) was posted on the PI's 
Lab YouTube Channel, Duke CHANT,  and embedded into REDCap . Comments were disabled on 
YouTube videos , and participants could not "like" the videos or  identify themselves or others. Only 
the participants assigned to the self-guided arm were  directed to these video links , which were  
not public.   
Study Intervention: The study intervention is a 5 -session version of the Unified Protocol for 
Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP; Barlow et al., 2018). Below is a brief 
description of the sessions . 
Session 1:  Motivation and psychoeducation about the adaptive nature of emotions - focuses on 
setting goals and increasing motivation for treatment, provides psychoeducation about the 
adaptive nature of emotional experiences. In this session the patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321073], measurable goals for treatment (e.g., go on one walk per day). Next, the patient 
and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321074]/cons of engaging in therapy  versus not pursuing treatment. 
This activity facilitates motivation for treatment. Finally, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321075].   
Session 2:  Learning to observe and describe emotional experiences - teaches mindfulness skills 
and promotes non -judgmental, present -focused  awareness of experiences and how to break 
down experiences into three components (thoughts, physical feelings, behaviors). In this session, 
the patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321076] a non -judgmental, present -focused 
approach to experiencing emotions. As part of this discussion, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321077], physical sensations, and behaviors to understand 
their experience in more detail.  
Session 3:  Cognitive flexibility - helps develop balanced thoughts through cognitive restructuring 
techniques. The patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321078] . The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321079] (i.e., habitual thought patterns that tend to be overly negative) and help the patient 
identify relevant thinking traps . Next, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321080] a given situation. This skill is analogous 
to cognitive restructuring in cognitive -behavioral therapy .  
Session 4:  Countering emotion -driven behaviors helps patients engage in effective behaviors 
when experiencing strong emotions. In this session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321081]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321082]. Alternative actions are 
behaviors that can help the patient manage their emotions in a way that is consistent with their 
long-term goals.  
Session 5:  Exposure and relapse prevention - reduces avoidance of emotion provoking stimuli 
by [CONTACT_321090], promotes continued practice of skills 
learned in treatment. This session focuses on encouraging patients to approach situations they 
would usually  avoid and use their copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] . The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321083]. Finally, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_321084].

1.0           Background  
  
Video -assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)  is being performed more frequently due to its less invasive 
nature, decreased postoperative pain, and shortened  post -operative  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. H owever, VATS 
procedure  still results in  significant postoperative pain  and the ideal analgesic for postoperative 
pain control  following  VATS remains unclear . Many modalities for pain control have been 
addressed in the literature: NSAIDs, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], epi[INVESTIGATOR_71543], paravertebral bloc ks, and surgeon 
infiltration (1, 2) . These have been used to manage the si gnificant pain experienced post -VATS  with 
varying degrees of success . However, the ideal analgesic regimen for postoperative pain from VATS 
procedures remains to be codified and changes  based on provide r preference. The purpose of this 
study  is to determine the effectiveness of  Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_104902] B lock (ES P) versus  surgeon 
infiltration for postoperative analgesic control after VATS.  
 Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_268362] P lane block  was  first described by [CONTACT_714463] 2016. This block has shown promise in 
relieving neuropathic pain and in providing analgesic coverage in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, mastec tomy, and thoracic surgeries  (3-7). This block can be thought of as a m odified paravertebral 
block, and  shows promise of increased safety compared to the paravertebral block. This is due to 
the unique anatomical approach that allows for anesthetic infiltration of the dorsal rami without 
the risk of needle insertion into the paravertebral space  (6). The improved safety of this approach 
could allow this block to be used on higher risk patients, like those  who present with 
coagulopathies.  
 
Another common method of managing postoperative VATS pain is through surgeon infiltration of 
the intercostal space with local a nesthetic. To p erform infiltration, surgeons  inject the anesthetic 
with direct visualization of the intercostal space, providing targeted analgesic c overage to the 
affected area (8). Some  drawbacks to this process are the relatively short duration of action of the 
block, and the requirement of the surgeon to inject all affected intercostal spaces to achieve the desired der matomal block (1, 2) . 
 
Exparel, a liposomal formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB), has shown significant promise in providing 
extended analgesic coverage in the postoperative period . Due to its extended release format, LB can 
provide analgesia coverage for up to 72 hours postoperative ly when compared to normal saline and 
has been suggested to reduce postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_391617]  (9). It has provided effective 
analgesia  in total knee arthr oplasty and hip arthroplasty  and has shown promise in open and 
laparoscopic colectom y (10- 12). However, there are also studies  showing that LB might not be 
superior to standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (SB) in  terms of duration of analgesia  (13-15). In order to 
compare the duration of action of both form of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], we’ll randomized the ESP group to both 
LB group and SB group.

Our hypothesis is that ESP block  is superior to surgeon infiltration  for pain scores , and LB will  be 
superior to SB for ESP block duration of action.  
 
2.0          Rationale and Specific Aims  
  
The specific aim of the study is to compare the difference between the ESP block and surgeon 
infiltration  in achieving the following:  
1. Improved postoperative pain scores  
2. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]  
3. Improved patient satisfaction scores  
4. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_714449] e effects (Nausea, sedation, ileus, urinary retention, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826])  
 
The primary endpoint of this study will be VAS pain score. The VAS scores will be taken with both 
rest and movement.  
 
The secondary endpoint includes intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_714450] (nausea, 
sedation, ileus, urinary retention, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]). The IV and PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_714451] 1, 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_972984] flatus , incidence of urinary retention, 
incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and time to discharge.  
 
All patients will receive a phone survey 6 months after surgery to assess for pain and quality of life.

4.0            Enrollment/Randomization 
  All VATS cases scheduled by [CONTACT_242639][INVESTIGATOR_242620]. The subjects will be contact[CONTACT_714464]-to- face by [CONTACT_40420]. Ceppa or [CONTACT_714472] in their clinics 
prior to their scheduled surgery date .  They will be given a copy of the consent and authorization 
form explaining this study.   The subjects will again be contact[CONTACT_714465].   If participation 
is agreed,  written consent will be taken and a signed copy of both the authorization and consent  
will be given to the participant.  
A total of 120 subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_714466] (40 per group):   The primary investigator will inform the anesthesiologist who will be 
doing the block as to what group the patients are randomized to.  The research staff completing the 
patients assessments will be the only person blinded to the randomization.

 receive intraoperative lidocaine and ketamine which is used to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_714453] . The patients will be intubated with dual lumen 
endotracheal tubes and placed on one -lung ventilation for the procedure. All patients will receive 
intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (PCA hydromorphone) post -operatively f or breakthrough 
pain. They will also be scheduled on PO acetaminophen. PO oxycodone PRN will be started on POD 
[ADDRESS_972987] and on movement (knee flexion) will be measured by [CONTACT_714467] (VAS). Nausea will be measured using a categorical scoring system (none=0; mild=1; moderate=2; severe=3). Sedation scores will also be assessed by a member  of the study 
team using a sedation scale (awake and alert=0; quietly awake=1; asleep but easily roused=2; deep 
sleep=3). All these parameters will be measured at 1, 24, [ADDRESS_972988] the Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_714454]. All adverse events or unanticipated problems that meet the criteria for 
prompt reporting will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days.  
  
7.0           Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation 
  
The patient can withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_714468].  
  
8.0           Statistical Considerations  
  
Primary outcome: VAS score at 24 and 48 hours  
Primary Research Hypothesis: ESP  will provide lower pain scores co mpared to surgeon infiltra tion 
and ESP with LB will provide longer pain control  than ESP with SB.  
 
Secondary outcomes: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_242628] 1, 24, [ADDRESS_972989] bowel 
movement, incidence of urinary retention, and incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_242629].  
 
Secondary Research Hypotheses: ESP  blocks will show improved pain control, improved patient 
satisfaction scores, and decreased nausea and sedation scores compared to surgeon infiltration.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using a standard statistical program (SAS or SPSS). All data 
will be summarized (means, standard deviations, standard errors, and ranges for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) by [CONTACT_19313]. Demographic data will 
be compared between the three  groups using ANOVA or chi -square tests as appropriate. The 
primary outcome, VAS at 24 and 48 hours, will be compared between the groups using repeated 
measures ANOVA; the model will include fixed effects for group, time, and the group by [CONTACT_714469]. Pain and satisfaction scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_714455]. Nausea and sedation scores will be compared be tween groups at each 
time point using Mantel -Haenszel chi -square tests for ordered categorical data. Distributions of the 
continuous variables will be examined, and a transformation of the data (e.g. natural logarithm) or nonparametric tests will be used a s necessary. A 5% significance level will be used for all 
comparisons.  
 Based on prior studies, the coefficient of variation for the VAS score at [ADDRESS_972990] 91% power be able to detect a 
60% decrease in VAS score between any two groups, assuming two- sided tests each conducted at a 
5% significance level.

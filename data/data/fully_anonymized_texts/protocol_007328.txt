graft attrition (1, 2). A major  contributor  to graft loss is interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy  (IF/TA) (3, 
4), previously called chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), which  is the result  of cumulative allograft 
damage of immunologic and non-immunologic origin. Studies  of protocol biopsies  have provided 
important clues on how early changes in graft histology relate  to long-term graft survival. Early 
sequential post-transplant  protocol biopsies show a rapid increase  in the prevalence of IF/TA, to over 
50% at one year  in most  studies, which  constitutes nearly  2/3rds of the total fibrosis burden  seen at 10 
years (4-5).  This means that the majority of IF/TA- a marker of previous injury and chronic  damage- 
occurs early  in the life of the kidney transplant. IF/TA on a 1-year biopsy  is associated with inferior graft 
survival (6-7) and can be used as a surrogate marker of long-term survival (8-9). 
The Banff 1997 classification (10),  updated 2007  (11), of renal allograft pathology uses semi-quantitative 
lesion scoring  and has proven  to be reproducible  and useful for the diagnosis, grading and management 
of acute rejection in kidney transplants (Appendix  1). “Acute T-cell-mediated rejection” is defined  by a 
minimum threshold of i2 t2, i.e., interstitial inflammation (>25% of the cortex)  and moderate  tubulitis  (> 
4 mononuclear cells/ tubule). Inflammation  which is insufficient to meet criteria for acute rejection is 
classified as “borderline change” or “suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665]” if there  is tubulitis (t1, t2 or t3) with  minor interstitial 
inflammation (i0 or i1) or interstitial inflammation (i2, i3) with mild (t1) tubulitis. 
Early studies  clearly established acute rejection (AR) as one of the strongest correlates of reduced  
allograft survival  (12-14). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a decline in incidence rates of acute rejection (AR) in the modern era 
of immunosuppression,  it is clear that AR remains a major risk factor for late graft loss.  Even early 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_86557], such as those  within the first year, have  lasting impact  on the graft.  In a 
study (15) of 28,[ADDRESS_94447]-transplant year was shown to confer risk (hazard ratio  for graft survival to 
1.[ADDRESS_94448]-transplant). These  risks are seen  in low immunologic risk populations as well. A study  (16) 
of 797 living  donor  kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86558] 1998-2010 found that 15.2% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86559]. In this analysis “borderline”  changes were  
analyzed as an AR event. Compared to no-AR,  all histologic types of AR (including  borderline change) led 
to abnormal histology  in 1 and 2 years protocol biopsies, including  more fibrosis + inflammation (6.3%  
vs. 21.9%), moderate/severe fibrosis (7.7% vs. 13.5%) and transplant glomerulopathy (1.4% vs. 8.3%, all 
p < 0.0001). AR were associated with reduced graft survival (HR = 3.07). Finally,  another  study  (17) of 
[ADDRESS_94449] residual  inflammation and eventually develop  a pattern of fibrosis + inflammation.  Studies  
which identified  AR as a strong predictor of death-censored graft survival (12, 14) found that most of 
that risk relates  to a higher rate of late graft loss following the epi[INVESTIGATOR_86560]. These data indicate 
that conventional  therapy  of acute  rejection,  while  improving graft function temporarily, may not be 
effective at preventing persistent inflammation and progressive fibrosis.  
Importantly, the negative impact  of AR on graft survival is not limited to those epi[INVESTIGATOR_86561]. Subclinical  rejection (SCR)  is the presence of AR on routine 
biopsies in patients with stable kidney  function. Subclinical inflammation (SCI) is a term  that is often 
used to indicate  the presence of inflammation on routine biopsies  that is insufficient to meet criteria for 
acute rejection. SCI and SCR are common, reported in 11-44%  of surveillance biopsies within the first 
year (18-20) and emerging data suggest that they are not benign. 
It has been shown that immune-mediated injury, even if subclinical, precedes and/or worsens IF/TA. A 
study of 961 prospective protocol kidney biopsies (21) over 10 years from 119 diabetic  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] a 
kidney-pancreas transplant  and one kidney transplant alone found that SCR (including  Banff borderline  
lesions) was a frequent finding early after transplantation  (in 61 and 46%  of biopsies at 1 and 3 months 
after transplant). If SCR persisted, it was not only associated with a higher degree of IF and TA but also 
resulted in significantly decreased renal function at 2 years after  transplantation.  Another study  of 124 
sequential protocol biopsies performed  at 2, 3, and 5 years after transplantation in 46 patients who 
exhibited histologic evidence  of CAN at 1 year found that the presence of SCR in association  with CAN 
correlated significantly with histologic  progression  defined  as an increased chronic allograft  damage 
index (CADI) score  of the follow-up biopsies  (22). Furthermore, a group of patients who exhibited  
repeated SCR in the sequential follow-up biopsies had a lower creatinine  clearance at [ADDRESS_94450]  on 
graft pathology  and function as AR. A study of clinically stable renal  allograft  biopsies showed  that 
histologic features of rejection were often accompanied  by [CONTACT_86596]-inflammatory 
gene transcripts, despi[INVESTIGATOR_86562]  (23). In this study,  biopsies  with 
borderline change, i.e., those with inflammation which  did not meet the threshold for acute rejection 
had a level  of expression of inflammatory gene transcripts which was intermediate  between that shown 
by [CONTACT_86597]. Another study  which correlated renal function with  
routine histology, immunohistochemical analysis, and quantitative assessment of 72 relevant immune 
function gene transcripts  found  that a transcriptional  profile indicative of activated TH1 type  T cells, but 
not the magnitude or composition of the infiltrate, uniquely defined  a functionally  significant allograft 
rejection (24). Thus it appears that the immune  response  is qualitatively  similar but quantitatively 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.07reduced in SCI, indicating that SCI carries the same potential for allo-immune damage  as clinical or 
subclinical AR. This is borne out by [CONTACT_86598]/TA as 
well as worsened renal  function. In a cohort of kidney  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86563], patients with SCI on their 1-month or 4-month 
biopsy had a higher risk of IF/TA score  > 2 on the 1-year biopsy (18). In a protocol  biopsy  analysis of a 
subpopulation of the CONCEPT study, SCI was observed in 30.5% of patients  with  an evaluable  biopsy  at 
1 year (20). At [ADDRESS_94451] associated with  poor outcomes. A study  of 124 biopsies for cause 
found that the sum  of inflammation in atrophic and non-atrophic parenchyma (Banff  “ti” or total  i-score) 
showed stronger correlations with microarray-based gene sets representing major biological processes 
during allograft rejection  than the Banff i-score, which  only looks  at inflammation in non-atrophic areas 
(25). In this study, the total-i  score was also found to be a better  predictor  of graft survival than the 
Banff i-score.  In another study, a decision tree analysis of the molecular changes in biopsies with  acute 
cellular rejection, borderline and non-rejection showed that i-total >27%  and tubulitis extent >3% 
matched the molecular  diagnosis of acute cellular rejection in 85% of cases  (26). This analysis indicated 
that the histologic assessment of rejection is more accurate when it relies primarily  on interstitial 
inflammation, and that inflammation >27% (which by [CONTACT_86599] 2007 classification is barely above  the 
threshold of 25%  for a score  of i2), even when associated with rare tubulitis, is a marker of immune 
mediated injury. These findings are supported by [CONTACT_86600]/TA predicts progressive decline in kidney  function  and reduced graft survival. In a study of 151 living-
donor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the combination of fibrosis and inflammation in 1-year protocol biopsies was 
associated with reduced graft function and survival as well as a rejection-like gene  expression signature, 
even among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86564] (27). Similarly, a study of 1-year 
surveillance biopsies  of 292 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86565]. Importantly, the degree of 
inflammation associated with fibrosis generally  did not qualify for the diagnosis of borderline  rejection  
(6). Another  study of 833 protocol  and 306 indicated biopsies found that the only predictor of allograft  
function outcome was persistent inflammation in sequential biopsies  (28). The investigators calculated  
the cumulative  inflammatory burden  by [CONTACT_86601] (at 1.5, 3, and 6 months after transplant) and found that the persistence  of 
inflammation in sequential biopsy  specimens regardless  of its severity,  localization,  or cellular 
composition predicted creatinine clearance at 1 and 2 years. The study concluded  that as detected by 
[CONTACT_86602], persistence of any inflammation including those infiltrates currently not considered  
by [CONTACT_86603] a morphological correlate of ongoing allograft  damage.  
The appropriate clinical  management for patients showing  SCI on routine  biopsies  remains an area  of 
uncertainty. The response  (or lack) of SCI to treatment remains  unclear, as studies that treated SCI have 
not clearly  differentiated between the level or type of inflammation  when  looking at graft outcomes (54-
58).
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.08Cytokines play an important role in regulating alloimmune responses (29).  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is 
synthesized by T cells and macrophages upon  immune  challenge, and is further induced by [CONTACT_86604] (IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor),  also generated in the context  of an immune  stimulus  
(30). Initially identified as a B-cell maturation factor (31, 32) IL-6 also serves as an immunoregulator of T 
cell growth and differentiation (33-35) and is critical for Th17 development.  A subtype  of Th cells, Th17 
cells specifically secrete Il-17, which is responsible for neutrophil  proliferation  and migration, 
endothelial cell activation,  and fibroblast activation  and proliferation.  Due to its strong anti-apoptotic 
properties, IL-6 can increase the effector/memory T-cell population (36) and has also been shown to 
skew Th cell differentiation  toward a Th17  phenotype and to prevent  the development of regulatory T 
cells (37).  
The exact role of IL-6 and Th17 cells in solid organ transplantation has not been fully elucidated; 
however, there are now considerable  data linking  them to immune mediated injury. In a mouse skin 
transplantation model,  IL-6 synergized  with  tumor  necrosis factor-α to promote T-cell alloimmune 
responses and impaired the ability of regulatory T cells to suppress effector T-cell alloimmune responses 
(38). IL-6 along with  interferon-c was found to be the major cytokine  upregulated  during allograft 
rejection in fully major  histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched  mouse model of cardiac 
transplantation (39). In this model,  neutralization  of IL-[ADDRESS_94452]  also been 
found to play a pathogenic role in the development of acute and chronic  lung rejection (40, 41).   
In renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], IL-6 expression in serum, urine and biopsy tissue is elevated during renal 
allograft rejection  (42-48)  and has been correlated with the degree  of inflammatory  cell infiltration  (45, 
46). Interestingly, the demonstration of the strongest  immunostaining for IL-6 in atrophic tubular areas 
(45) and increase in soluble IL-6 receptor  in urine  12 and 6 months before late graft failure  (49),  raises  
the possibility that IL-6 may play a significant role in mediating chronic graft injury a. A biopsy study  of 
40 stable  renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 2-3 years  after transplantation  detected IL-6 transcripts in 18% and 
these were correlated with  lymphocytic infiltrate,  fibrosis, and tubular atrophy (50).  Of the cytokines 
studies, IL-[ADDRESS_94453]  consistent negative predictive value for histological  injury. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_86566] a role for IL-6 in chronic  rejection  and potentially  graft loss. A G/C single nucleotide 
polymorphism at position –174 within the 5′ flanking region of the IL-6 gene is known to be associated 
with differential plasma levels of IL-6 in healthy individuals (51). In kidney transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  the high  
IL-6 producer phenotype for this genetic  polymorphism (GG or GC) has been associated with the 
production of donor-specific HLA antibodies post-transplantation (52) as well as reduced 5-year graft 
survival (53). These data  collectively indicate that IL-[ADDRESS_94454] or slow the

1.2 Tocilizumab Background
Tocilizumab (TCZ), formerly known as myeloma receptor  antibody is a recombinant humanized 
antihuman monoclonal  antibody of the immunoglobulin  IgG1 subclass directed against  the IL-6R  and 
produced by [CONTACT_12060]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies of TCZ have been 
conducted or are ongoing in various disease  areas,  including adult-onset RA, systemic-onset juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis  and polyarticular juvenile  idiopathic arthritis.
The elimination half-life  of TCZ can be approximately 12.9  days.  The TCZ exposures were  stable over 2- 
years of treatment in the WA17823 study  of 841 patients. The observed  mean  (± SD) Ctrough  at 8 mg/kg IV 
was 15.9  ± 12.0 µg/ml  at week 24 and 19.9 ± 17.0 µg/ml  at week 104. The observed mean (± SD) Ctrough  
at 4 mg/kg was 1.02 ± 6.14 µg/ml at week 24 and 1.09 ± 2.77 µg/ml at week 104.
The [COMPANY_002] clinical development program in adult RA, comprised five pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 trials  and two open-
label, long-term treatment extension studies.  Further information on TCZ can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.[ADDRESS_94455] variance estimators  was used to calculate relative risks of acute rejection and 
total inflammation. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze associations with the estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  by [CONTACT_86605] (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation.
The analysis  identified subclinical acute cellular  rejection  in 7.3% (n=28) of all surveillance  biopsies; of 
these 5.5%  (n=21) had Banff  type 1a rejection. Subclinical inflammation (SCI) insufficient to meet criteria 
for acute  rejection was found in 32% (n=122)  of all surveillance biopsies. This included  biospi[INVESTIGATOR_86567]-specific inflammation.  Both interstitial fibrosis (Banff  ci-score)  and tubular 
atrophy (Banff ct-score) were significantly associated with the presence of inflammation.

Therefore, in this analysis, the presence of SCI and SCR was found to be significantly  associated with 
both the development  of chronicity and a decrease in graft function at [ADDRESS_94460]-transplantation. The 12-month biopsy found  persistent inflammation in the majority. All patients 
with subclinical rejection  had been  treated with IV methylprednisolone pulse and intensification of 
baseline immunosuppression. Additionally, 2 had been treated with Thymoglobulin and 3 with  IVIg.  
Patients with SCI on their initial  biopsy received  oral prednisone pulse (5 patients) or no specific 
treatment (5 patients).

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose
At UCSF Medical Center, transplant kidney biopsies  are performed for cause (e.g, for renal graft 
dysfunction) or for surveillance (kidney transplant surveillance biopsies at [ADDRESS_94466]-transplant in 
all patients, and at 3-6 months following previous  biopsies showing  acute rejection or graft 
inflammation). Currently  we perform  30-40 renal  allograft biopsies per month. All kidney  transplant 
biopsies are obtained under  real-time ultrasound guidance using a 16-gauge automated biopsy needle. 
Two cores  are generally obtained. All biopsies are read by [CONTACT_86609] 1997 criteria  (updated 2007). C4d staining (for the diagnosis  of acute  antibody-mediated 
rejection) is done on all biopsies. Patients with biopsies  showing AR or AI on surveillance or for-cause 
biopsies undergo repeat surveillance biopsies 3-6 months later.  Patients with AR, whether clinical or 
subclinical, are usually treated with  IV steroids. Due to uncertainty regarding the benefits of treatment 
in general and lack of data supporting the efficacy of increasing usual immunosuppressive  agents, 
patients with AI (borderline change or nonspecific inflammation) are not currently treated with  any 
specific therapy.  Therefore, these patients  who receive the standard of care  treatment  (steroids and/or 
continuation of their maintenance immunosuppressive regimen) form an ideal group in which  to test 
the efficacy of treatment with TCZ. Based  on available literature and our preliminary data, over 12 
months approximately  90-100  patients  will fulfill entry criteria and with a 50% enrollment  rate, 50 
patients are likely to consent to the trial.  
The currently recommended dose  of TCZ for adult patients with  rheumatoid  arthritis  (the FDA approved  
indication) is 8 mg/kg given once every four  weeks as an IV infusion. Given  the accumulated efficacy and 
safety data for this dose, we will plan to use the same dose in kidney transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86570]. 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
[ADDRESS_94467] at baseline 
and at 6 months  follow-up will be performed  using  the Banff “i” and “t” scores.  In addition, more  
precise estimates of the inflammation will be obtained  using computer  assisted image  analysis to 
determine the inflammatory cell density  per sq.mm in the renal  cortex  (glomeruli excluded) of baseline 
and follow-up biopsies which will include LCA, CD4, CD18, CD20, CD68,  FoxP3, and T-bet.  Results will be 
expressed as % of the cortex with inflammatory cells and the number  of cells  per sq mm of cortex.  The 
% value for any variable  (inflammation or fibrosis) on the qualifying biopsy will be taken as the baseline, 
and the increase or decrease in the variable  at follow-up biopsy calculated = (% value at follow up minus 
% value at baseline)/ (% value at baseline).
In addition,  we will perform  quantitative in situ hybridization for IL-6 mRNA  and protein expression on 
paraffin sections.  Frozen  or paraffin  sections  of the kidney biopsy will be stained  (by 
[CONTACT_31122]/ immunohistochemistry) for downstream IL-6 mediated inflammatory response 
genes (SAA2 and CRP), Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).    
We have recently validated an in situ hybridization analysis in biopsies  of renal allografts.  The IL6 signal  
is present with  inflammation  and tubulitis  (acute  cell mediated rejection) but is absent in acute or 
chronic antibody  medicated  rejection.  The use of this assay may further  validate the therapeutic effect 
of blockade of the IL-[ADDRESS_94468] been reported to be elevated in the urine of patients  with  graft inflammation. PCR 
primers for these genes  are available from Qiagen and a SYBR  Green-based  real-time  PCR assay will be 
used to quantify the transcripts.

4.4 Immunization during TCZ  therapy
Live/attenuated vaccines should not be given  within [ADDRESS_94471]  all patients  complete the withdrawal visits or follow-up phone calls as detailed  in the Schedule 
of Assessments.
If the patient decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment (“refuses treatment”), he/she will be 
asked if he/she can still be contact[CONTACT_83529]. The outcome of that discussion  will be 
documented in both the medical records and in the CRF.  A complete final  evaluation  at the time of the 
patient’s withdrawal  will be made with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing  from the study. 
Before categorizing a patient  as lost to follow-up,  we will attempt to contact [CONTACT_76409] a responsible 
relative by [CONTACT_86611],  follow-up of 
any ongoing AE and to establish as completely as possible the reason for the withdrawal.
When applicable, patients will be informed of circumstances under which their participation  may be 
terminated by [CONTACT_86612]’s consent.  The investigator may withdraw patients 
from the study  in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse events, treatment  failure, lack of compliance  
with the study and/or study procedures (e.g., dosing instructions, study visits),  or any reason where  it is 
felt by [CONTACT_86613]. The 
reason(s) for withdrawal will be documented and explained  to the patient.
If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an adverse  event,  the specific event will be 
recorded on the CRF. There will be an attempt to follow the patient until the event has resolved or 
stabilized.
An excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study non-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary 
withdrawal of patients will be avoided. Should a patient decide to withdraw,  all efforts will be made to 
complete and report the observations prior to withdrawal as thoroughly  as possible. 
5.[ADDRESS_94472]-transplant. 
After enrollment,  subjects will be randomized  to group  1 (standard of care group) or group 2 (TCZ group. 
Randomization will be stratified to include equal  numbers of participants  with  AR and AI in each group.  
Block randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_86614]-generated 
random numbers. The pathologist will be blinded to the randomization. 
In Group 1 (standard of care  group):
Participants with AI will continue their usual immunosuppression and not receive  any specific 
intervention. 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.019Participants with AR will receive IV methylprednisolone  pulse (500 mg IV daily  for 3 doses) 
followed by [CONTACT_86615]  2 weeks down to 5 mg prednisone per day in addition to 
continuing their  usual immunosuppression 
In Group 2 (TCZ group):
Participants will receive TCZ 8 mg/kg intravenously at four-week intervals for a total of [ADDRESS_94473] of care described for group 1. This means that:
Participants with AI will receive TCZ 8 mg/kg intravenously at four-week intervals for a total  of 6 
doses in addition  to continuing their  usual immunosuppression
Participants with AR will receive TCZ 8 mg/kg intravenously at four-week  intervals  for a total of 6 
doses. In addition, they will receive IV steroids and oral prednisone taper  identical to SCR 
participants in group 1 and continue their usual  immunosuppressive regimen.
Usual maintenance immunosuppression regimen is defined as follows:
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86574] 5 mg/day. 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86575]-free regimens  will remain prednisone-free (if they  have SCI) or start  
maintenance prednisone after pulse steroids (if they have SCR). 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosing will be maintained or adjusted per standard of care to 
dose ranging from 500-3000 mg daily.  
Tacrolimus dosing will be maintained or adjusted to aim for trough levels of 4-10 mcg/L.
 
Although we believe that it is extremely unlikely that the addition of TCZ to standard post-transplant 
immunosuppression will increase the probability of fibrosis, we nevertheless used  a two-tailed 
alternative hypothesis and set alpha at 0.05. Based  on a review of the relevant literature and our 
previous experience, we anticipate that 50%  of study  participants randomized to group 1 (standard  of 
care group) will manifest  persistent inflammation at 12 months compared with 10% of study  
participants randomized to group 2 (TCZ group).  We will have  83%  power to detect  an effect of this 
magnitude, i.e., a 40% absolute difference  between groups with  a sample size of 24 per group, or a total  
N=48.
Currently we perform 6-month surveillance biopsies  of about 20-[ADDRESS_94474] AR or AI  
on their biopsies. We aim to enroll 4-6 patients  per month, so the period of recruitment  will be 
approximately 12 months to accrue 48 patients. The study period  will be 12 months (6 months of 
therapy + 6 months of follow up) so that total duration  will be [ADDRESS_94475] while she/he  is participating in this study.
6.0 STUDY MEDICATION
6.1 Tocilizumab
Tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®)  is a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal  antibody of 
the immunoglobulin IgG1κ  (gamma  1, kappa) subclass with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  H2L2 polypeptide structure.  Each  
light chain and heavy  chain consists of 214 and 448 amino acids, respectively. The four polypeptide 
chains are linked  intra- and inter-molecularly by [CONTACT_86616].  TCZ has a molecular weight of 
approximately 148 kDa.
TCZ is supplied  as a sterile, preservative-free solution for intravenous (IV) infusion at a concentration of 
20 mg/mL. TCZ is a colorless  to pale  yellow  liquid, with  a pH of about 6.5. Single-use vials are available  
containing 80 mg/4 mL, 200 mg/10 mL, or 400 mg/20 mL of TCZ. Injectable solutions of TCZ are 
formulated in an aqueous  solution containing disodium phosphate dodecahydrate and sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate dehydrate (as a 15 mmol/L phosphate buffer),  polysorbate 80 (0.5 mg/mL),  and 
sucrose (50 mg/mL). 
TCZ will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_8229]. The Sponsor or designee of the study  will ensure  
maintenance of complete and accurate  records of the receipt, dispensation, and disposal  or return of all 
study drug in accordance  with  21 Code of Federal  Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 312.57  and 312.62  and 
Genentech requirements.”
6.1.1 Tocilizumab Dosage and Administration
The recommended dose  of TCZ for adult patients is 8 mg/kg given  once every four weeks as an IV 
infusion. TCZ is currently approved for use alone or in combination with  methotrexate  and/or other 
disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.
TCZ will be diluted to 100 mL by a healthcare professional with  sterile 0.9%w/v sodium chloride solution 
using aseptic technique. TCZ will be administered as an IV infusion over 1 hour. For individuals whose 
body weight  is more than 100 kg, the maximum dose per infusion will not exceed 800 mg.
One vial containing  400 mg TCZ or two vials containing 200 mg TCZ will be required  for each 50 kg body 
weight to achieve an 8 mg/kg dose.  The number of vials to be used  depends on the patient’s body 
weight as follows:
1.         One 400-mg  vial (or two 200-mg vials)  will be used for patients  with  a body weight ≤50 kg.
2.         Two  400-mg vials (or four 200-mg  vials) will be used for patients with a body weight  >[ADDRESS_94476] infusion. They do not need monitoring after subsequent infusions.
6.1.2 Tocilizumab Storage
TCZ will not be used after the expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695]  (EXP) shown on the pack.
For vials: Vials will be stored between 2ºC – 8ºC, will not freeze. The container will be kept  in the outer 
carton in order  to protect  from light.
For prepared infusion solution: The prepared  infusion solution of TCZ is physically and chemically stable  
in 0.9% w/v sodium chloride  solution at 30ºC for 24 hours. From a microbiological  point of view,  the 
prepared infusion will be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and 
conditions will not be longer than  24 hours  at 2ºC – 8ºC, unless dilution has taken place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions.
6.1.3 Tocilizumab Overdosage
There are limited data  available  on overdoses with TCZ. One case of accidental  overdose  was reported in 
which a patient with multiple myeloma received a dose  of 40 mg/kg. No adverse drug reactions were 
observed. No serious adverse  drug reactions  were observed in healthy  volunteers who received single 
doses of up to 28 mg/kg, although all [ADDRESS_94477] dose  of 28 mg/kg developed dose-limiting 
neutropenia.
In case of an overdose, the patient will be monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions. 
Patients who develop  adverse reactions will receive appropriate  symptomatic treatment.
6.[ADDRESS_94478]-transplant maintenance immunosuppression containing 
tacrolimus, MMF/ MPA, with or without  prednisone.  Study subjects will continue their maintenance 
immunosuppression as usual (if they have  AI) or receive  a pulse of IV methylprednisolone at 500 mg 
daily for 3 days (if they have AR). Subjects who are already receiving prednisone will continue  it at 5 
mg/day. Subjects on prednisone-free  regimens  will remain prednisone-free  (if they  have AI) or start  
maintenance prednisone after the pulse of IV methylprednisolone is completed (if they have  AR). MMF 
or MPA doses will be continued as per standard of care  with doses ranging  from 500-3000  mg daily,  with 
tacrolimus dosing adjusted  to aim for trough levels  of 4-10 mcg/L. All prescribers in the study  will be 
required to enroll in the Mycophenolate  REMS  program as noted below  in Section 7.2.2.
7.0  DOSE MODIFICATION/TOXICITY MANAGEMENT
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients  participating  in this study.  These 
measures will be addressed through exclusion criteria  (see Section  4.2) and routine  monitoring  as 
follows.  
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
[ADDRESS_94479] of medical interviews, recording  of 
adverse events, physical examinations, blood  pressure,  and laboratory measurements at 1-monthly 
intervals.  Subjects  will be evaluated for adverse  events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse 
events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their  
participation in the study.  
7.[ADDRESS_94480]  commonly reported infections  (5% to 8% of patients) in clinical studies of rheumatoid arthritis 
were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_40937]. In the [ADDRESS_94481]  of treatment with TCZ on demyelinating  disorders is not known; multiple sclerosis and 
chronic inflammatory  demyelinating polyneuropathy  were reported rarely in clinical  studies of 
rheumatoid arthritis.  Patients with known CNS demyelinating disorders will be excluded from 
participation. All subjects  will be closely monitored  for signs  and symptoms potentially indicative of 
central demyelinating disorders.  Treatment  with TCZ will be interrupted during assessment of a 
potential demyelination  event and if confirmed, patient  will be withdrawn from  the study. 
Hematologic Abnormalities and Bleeding Events
Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have been observed following treatment with TCZ in 
combination with MTX. 
In the 24 week, controlled clinical  studies, decreases  in neutrophil  counts <1000/mm3 occurred  in 1.8% 
and 3.4%  of patients in the 4 mg/kg  and 8 mg/kg TCZ plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 
0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Approximately  half of the instances of ANC 
<1000/mm3 occurred within 8 weeks of starting therapy. In the same studies, decreases  in platelet 
counts <100,000/mm3 occurred  in 1.3% and 1.7% of patients on 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg  TCZ plus DMARD, 
respectively, compared to 0.5% of patients  on placebo  plus DMARD, without associated bleeding events.  
It is possible that there  may be an increased  risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in kidney  
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86576]/ MPA,  a known myelosuppressive agent.
The risk mitigation  strategies for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are summarized  in Tables 4 and 5, 
respectively.

Patients withdrawn from TCZ treatment due to a reduced neutrophil count will be monitored  for signs of 
infection, with  treatment as deemed appropriate  by [CONTACT_978], and will have  a repeat white  blood cell count 
with differential performed  weekly until the ANC is above 1000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L). If the ANC does  
not return to above 1000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L) within 2 months (or sooner if deemed  necessary by [CONTACT_1600]), a hematology referral will be considered.

hematology referral will be considered.
Elevated Liver Enzymes and Hepatic Events
Treatment with TCZ was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations in clinical studies 
in rheumatoid  arthritis, particularly when it was used in combination with DMARDs.  Mild elevations  (up 
to 3X ULN) of ALT and AST were common, seen in 36% and 22% respectively of patients receiving TCZ 
monotherapy, and especially frequent when TCZ 8 mg/kg  was used in combination with  DMARDs  (48% 
and 41%  respectively compared  to 23% and 17%  with placebo + DMARDs). Severe elevations of ALT and 
AST (to >5X ULN) were  seen in 1.5% and 0.2% receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs vs. 0.3% and <0.1%  in 
the group  receiving placebo  plus DMARDs.    These elevations did not result in apparent permanent  or 
clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical  trials.  The effects on ALT and AST when TCZ is used  in 
combination with tacrolimus and mycophenolate  mofetil/ mycophenolic acid are not known.

Patients withdrawn from TCZ treatment due to elevated liver  function  tests will have  repeat tests 
performed, as clinically  appropriate, until levels  return  to baseline.  If  the patient’s liver function tests 
have not returned to baseline within 6 months (or sooner, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978]), an ultrasound 
and/or liver biopsy will be considered.
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.025Cardiovascular Events and Elevated Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_86577] (total cholesterol,  LDL, HDL, triglycerides)  were observed at 6 weeks 
following initiation  of TCZ in the controlled 24 week clinical trials  and remained stable thereafter.  Mean 
increased in LDL, HDL and LDL/HDL ratio at week 24 in the TCZ 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group  were  20 
mg/dl, 5 mg/dl and 0.[ADDRESS_94486] an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders;  therefore,  risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease (e. g., hypertension,  hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]) will be managed  as part of their standard of 
care.  
Malignancies
Exposure-adjusted incidence of malignancies  was similar in the TCZ groups (1.32  events per 100 patient-
years) and in the placebo plus DMARD group  (1.37 events per 100 patient-years). There  is a known  
increased incidence  of malignancies associated with  post-kidney  transplant  immunosuppression. 
Although no imbalance of malignancies was observed in controlled clinical trials  of TCZ, malignancies  
may become a concern  when it is used concomitantly with post-kidney transplant immunosuppression.  
TCZ will be discontinued  in patients with  malignancies  (with the exception of local  basal  or squamous  
cell carcinoma  of the skin that is completely excised with free margins).
Infusion Reactions, Hypersensitivity or Anaphylaxis:
An infusion/dose reaction  is defined as an adverse  event occurring during and within 24 hours after the 
infusion or subcutaneous  injection of TCZ. This may include hypersensitivity reactions  or anaphylactic 
reactions. In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, infusion reactions were  reported  in 8% and 7% of 
patients in the 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kgTTCZ  plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 5% of patients 
in the placebo plus DMARD group.  The most frequently reported event for both doses during the 
infusion was hypertension (1% for both  doses), while the most  frequently reported event  occurring 
within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache (1% for both doses)  and skin reactions  (1% for 
both doses), including rash, pruritus and urticaria.  These events were  not treatment limiting.  
Hypersensitivity reactions requiring treatment discontinuation, including anaphylaxis, associated with 
TCZ were  reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) in the 24 week, controlled trials and in 0.2%  (8 out of 4009) in 
the all-exposure population. These reactions  were generally observed during the second to fourth  
infusion of TCZ.
Signs of a possible  hypersensitivity reaction include but are not limited to: fever,  chills, pruritus,  
urticaria, angioedema, skin rash, cardiopulmonary  reactions,  including  chest pain,  dyspnea, hypotension 
or hypertension.
Healthcare professionals administering TCZ infusions   will be trained in the appropriate administrative 
procedures, be able to recognize the symptoms associated with  potential anaphylactic or 
hypersensitivity reactions,  and have  the appropriate medication available  for immediate use in case of 
anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity  reaction during or after administration  of TCZ.  Study subjects will be 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
[ADDRESS_94487]  of care for management of the hypersensitivity reaction.  A blood sample for 
the presence  of anti-TCZ antibodies and PK/PD testing  will be obtained at time of event and at least [ADDRESS_94488] dose.
Viral Reactivation
Viral reactivation has been  reported with  immunosuppressive biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_86578]. No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation  were 
observed in the trials; however patients  who  screened  positive for hepatitis were  excluded. Reactivation 
of viral and other serious infections (e.g. EBV or TB) has been observed with standard post-transplant 
immunosuppression and patients will be monitored carefully during the study for this event.
Drug Interaction
The formation  of CYP450  enzymes may be suppressed by [CONTACT_86618] (eg, IL-6) during 
chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is expected that for molecules that antagonize cytokine activity, such 
as TCZ, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could  be normalized.  When starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_86579], patients  taking medications which are individually  dose-adjusted and metabolized via CYP450, 3A4, 
1A2, or 2C9 (e.g. atorvastatin, calcium  channel blockers,  theophylline, warfarin,  phenytoin, ciclosporin, 
or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) will be monitored as doses may need to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic 
effect. In particular, attention will be paid to the levels  of tacrolimus, a CYP3A4 substrate,  and doses  will 
be adjusted  as needed  to maintain levels of 4-10 mcg/L.  Given long elimination half-life (t1/2) of TCZ, 
the effect on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_7374].
Reproductive Issues
Adequate and well-controlled studies with TCZ have not been conducted  in pregnant women. All 
females of reproductive potential will be required to use acceptable contraception for the duration of 
the study. All females  of reproductive potential  will screened for pregnancy  prior to enrollment  and 
before infusion of every  dose of TCZ. If pregnancy  is discovered, participants will be terminated from the 
study. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy  outcomes in women  exposed to 
TCZ during pregnancy. The study investigator will register any pregnant patients and pregnant women  
will be encouraged to register themselves  by [CONTACT_3379]  [PHONE_2008].
7.[ADDRESS_94489]  been on prior to 
enrollment in the study will be continued during the study. Enrollment will include  all kidney  transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86580], mycophenolate mofetil/ mycophenolic acid with or without  prednisone.   At UCSF, typi[INVESTIGATOR_86581] 30% of kidney  transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_86582]. 
Therefore, some study  subjects will be on prednisone (5 mg daily)  at the time of enrollment  and others 
will not be on prednisone. Those who are on prednisone will remain on it and those who are not on 
prednisone will remain  prednisone  free (if they have  AI) or receive pulse IV methylprednisolone  and 
start maintenance prednisone (if they have  AR). During  randomization, we will aim to keep the 
proportion of patients on prednisone equal in both arms. As with standard post-transplant  care,  all 
participants will undergo a physical  exam, medical interview  and laboratory testing (complete blood 
count, serum electrolytes, BUN and serum creatinine, fasting glucose, liver  function  tests and 12-hour 
trough tacrolimus  levels) every month  and they will be queried and examined for known  drug  toxicities  
and signs/  symptom of infections. Doses of tacrolimus, MMF/  MPA acid and prednisone will be modified 
if needed to address  toxicity  or infectious concerns. 
6.2.2 Mycophenolate REMS
All prescribers participating in the study will be required to enroll in the FDA Mycophenolate  REMS (risk 
evaluation and mitigation  strategy) program. Of note, all study participants will already have  been  on a 
maintenance regimen containing MMF/MPA and will not be started on it as part of the study.  
Use of MMF/MPA during pregnancy is associated with  an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss 
and an increased risk of congenital malformations. Females of reproductive potential  will be made 
aware of these risks and will be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning.  All females 
must be willing to use acceptable  contraception during the entire period of the study.  Patients will be 
made aware  that MMF/MPA reduces blood levels  of the hormones in the oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_86583]. Urine pregnancy test is part of the screening laboratory tests 
and will be repeated  at each  follow-up  visit.  Results of all pregnancy  tests will be discussed with the 
patient.  
For those  females who are discovered  to be pregnant  either at study screening or enrollment or during 
the study  and who are on MMF/MPA or within 6 weeks of discontinuing therapy,  the study investigators  
will report the pregnancy  to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy registry ([PHONE_2009]) and strongly  
encourage the patient to enroll in the pregnancy  registry. When  appropriate,  pregnant patients will be 
switched to alternative immunosuppression with  less potential for embryofetal  toxicity after  a 
discussion of maternal and fetal risks and benefits.

9.1 Ongoing Review 
The progress of the study  will be monitored  by a two-member  DSMB, which includes  2 transplant 
surgeons ([CONTACT_86635] and [CONTACT_86636]). The DSMB will be chartered to perform  independent  
oversight for the trial through  regular review of enrollment and safety information  provided  in tables, 
listings and figures generated from the clinical database. If the trial is suspended for any reason  they will 
monitor the reassessment and potential  restarting of the trial.  
The DSMB  will have the authority to suspend the trial. The trial will be suspended if the board 
determines that the risks  to study participants  exceed  the originally described risks  and/or that 
modifications to the protocol  are needed to minimize the risks. The DSMB will receive safety data  at 
least every [ADDRESS_94491]. The DSMB will be informed immediately if a

All patients  will provide  samples for anti-TCZ antibody testing as described in the Schedule  of 
Assessments (baseline, 12 weeks and at termination of therapy).  In addition, samples for PK/PD will be 
tested for each time  point  when  an anti-TCZ antibody  test is done.  All patients experiencing  events 
related to serious hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions that cause  the patient to be withdrawn  from 
TCZ treatment will need to have anti-TCZ  and PK/PD testing at time of event,  and also [ADDRESS_94496] dose for anti-TCZ and PK/PD testing.    All samples  collected for immunogenicity  assays  will be tested 
using a screening assay and, if positive, by a confirmation assay to determine specificity.  If the 
confirmation assay is positive, a neutralizing assay will be performed to test for the ability to inhibit  the 
activity of TCZ. Reports of the results of these analyses will be provided by [CONTACT_86621]-TCZ  antibodies.  Samples will be shipped as described in Appendix B.

11.0 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1 Adverse Event  and Reporting Definitions
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical  occurrence in a subject participating in an 
investigational trial or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An  adverse event can be an 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or 
disease temporally  associated with  or occurring  during the use of an investigational product whether or 
not considered related to the investigational product.
Additionally, an AE can be any of the following: 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.034Any new  disease  or exacerbation of an existing  disease (a worsening  in the character, frequency, or 
severity of a known condition) 
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache)  not present at baseline.
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., electrocardiogram,  x-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms  or leads to a change in TCZ or concomitant  treatment  or discontinuation from 
TCZ.
In the event of an adverse event, the first concern will be for the safety of the subject.   Investigators are 
required to report to Genentech Drug Safety any serious adverse  event,  and non-serious  adverse events 
of special interest, whether expected  or unexpected , and whether or not considered  related to the TCZ.
The study sponsor or designee further  agrees to forward reports to Genentech  of serious adverse events 
and non-serious adverse  events of special interest,  regardless  of attribution to the Investigational 
medicinal product.  
All events meeting these criteria will be reported for the time period beginning  with any amount  of 
exposure to TCZ through the protocol-defined follow-up period.  Serious criteria, definitions, and 
guidance for reporting follow.
Serious adverse  events  (SAE) (Immediately Reportable  to the Sponsor)  are adverse  events occurring  at 
any dose which  meet one or more of the following serious criteria:
Results in death (i.e. the AE caused or lead to death)
Is life-threatening  (i.e. the AE placed the subject at immediate  risk of death; it does not apply to an 
AE which hypothetically might have caused the death if it were more severe)
Requires or prolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical  
procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134])
Is disabling  (i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial  disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal 
life functions)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus  of a subject 
exposed to the trial drug prior to conception  or during pregnancy)
It does not meet any of the above serious  criteria but may  jeopardize the subject and may require  
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  above
SAEs include  any sign, symptom or medical condition that meets any of the above criteria and emerges 
during TCZ treatment or during a post-treatment follow-up period  that (1) was not present at the start 
of treatment and is not a chronic condition  that is part of the patient’s medical history, OR (2) was 
present at the start of treatment or as part of the patient’s medical history but worsened in severity 
and/or frequency during therapy.
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
[ADDRESS_94499], or other means  will be reported 
appropriately. Each reported  AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start  and end dates), 
regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to theTCZ  (see following  guidance), 
and actions  taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, we will apply the following general 
guideline:
Yes
There is a plausible  temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of TCZ, and 
the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical  state, intercurrent  illness,  or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern  of response to the TCZ; and/or the AE abates or 
resolves upon discontinuation of the TCZ or dose  reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-
challenge.
No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology  other thanTCZ (e.g., preexisting  medical  condition, 
underlying disease, intercurrent illness,  or concomitant  medication); and/or the AE has no plausible 
temporal relationship to TCZ administration (e.g.,  cancer  diagnosed [ADDRESS_94500] dose of study drug).
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the current Investigator Brochure or not identified.  
This includes adverse events  for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in 
the Investigator Brochure  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if 
the Investigator Brochure only referred  to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers  to the intensity  of an AE (rated as 
mild, moderate, or severe; see section on “Assessment of Severity of Adverse  Events”); the event itself 
may be of relatively  minor  medical significance (such  as severe headache  without  any further  findings).
Severity and seriousness  need to be independently assessed for each  AE recorded  on the CRF.
Eliciting Adverse Events
A consistent methodology  for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation timepoints will be adopted. Examples 
of non-directive  questions include: 
“How have you felt since  your last clinical  visit?”
“Have you had any new or changed health problems  since you were  last here?” 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
[ADDRESS_94501] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. Avoid  
colloquialisms and abbreviations.
a. Diagnosis  vs. Signs and Symptoms
If known  at the time  of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice,  asterixis,  and elevated  
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized 
as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report  the information that is 
currently available. If a diagnosis  is subsequently established,  it should be reported as follow-up 
information.
b. Deaths
All deaths that occur  during the protocol-specified AE reporting period  (see Section  5.1.2),  regardless of 
attribution, will be reported  to the appropriate  parties. When recording  a death, the event or condition 
that caused  or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept.  If the 
cause of death  is unknown and cannot  be ascertained  at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained 
Death”. This includes  death attributed to progression of underlying disease.
Death should  be considered an outcome  and not a distinct event.  The event or condition  that caused or 
contributed to the fatal  outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept  on the Adverse  
Event CRF.  Generally, only one such  event  should be reported.   The term “sudden death” should only be 
used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac  causes in a patient 
with or without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_94502] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of 
death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  If the cause  of death later  becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), 
“unexplained death” should  be replaced  by [CONTACT_25749]. If the death  is attributed  to 
progression of underlying disease, progression should be captured on the Adverse  Event CRF.  
c. Preexisting  Medical Conditions
A preexisting  medical  condition is one that is present at the start  of the study. Such  conditions  should be 
reported as medical  and surgical history.  A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed 
throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only  if the frequency,  severity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study. When  reporting such events,  it is important to convey  the concept 
that the preexisting  condition  has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent 
headaches”).

e. Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant  while  receiving investigational therapy  or within [ADDRESS_94504] dose ofTCZ, a report will be completed and expeditiously submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow-
up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion,  whether accidental,  
therapeutic, or spontaneous, will always be classified  as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE.  
Similarly, any congenital  anomaly/birth defect in a child born  to a female subject exposed  to TCZ will be 
reported as an SAE.  A  Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form will be completed by [CONTACT_86622] 
24 hours after  learning of the pregnancy  Pregnancy  should not be recorded  on the Adverse  Event CRF.  
The sponsor  will counsel the patient,  discussing the risks of the pregnancy  and the possible effects on 
the fetus.   Monitoring of the will should continue  until  conclusion of the pregnancy.
Abortions
Any spontaneous abortion will be classified  as an SAE (as the sponsor considers spontaneous abortions 
to be medically significant events),  recorded on the Adverse Event CRF, and reported to the sponsor 
within 1 working day after  learning  of the event  (see section on “Reporting Requirements for 
Pregnancies”).  
Congenital Anomalies/Birth  Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child  born to a female patient or female partner of a male 
patient exposed to TCZ will be classified as an SAE,  recorded on the Adverse Event CRF,  and reported  to 
the sponsor within 1 working day after  learning of the event (see section  on “Reporting Requirements 
for Pregnancies”).
f. Post-Study Adverse  Events
The investigator will expeditiously report any SAE or non-serious AESI  occurring  after a subject has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to priorTCZ exposure regardless of how 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
[ADDRESS_94505]  report the following events to Genentech Drug Safety within 24 hours after  
learning of the event, regardless  of relationship to study drug:
SAEs.
Non-serious and serious AEs of special interest.
All Non-Serious Adverse  Events originating from the Study will be forwarded in a quarterly  report  to 
Genentech.
Pregnancies.
The Investigator must  report new significant follow-up  information for these events to Genentech Drug 
Safety within 1 working day after  becoming aware of the information.  New significant information 
includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis.
Significant new diagnostic test results.
Change in causality  based on new  information.
Change in the event’s  outcome, including recovery.
Additional narrative information on the clinical  course of the event.

12.[ADDRESS_94508] at baseline 
and 6 months  follow  up will be performed  using  the Banff “t” and “i” scores. Computer assisted  image 
analysis will be used to calculate the quantity of interstitial LCA positive cells, CD68 positive cells  and 
FoxP3 positive cells  on biopsies  at 6 months and 12 months and the results will be expressed as a 
percentage (%) of the total  cortex (for LCA positive  cells and collagen expression) or as a percentage  (%) 
of the total  number  of cells (for CD68 positive and FoxP3 positive cells). The % value  for any variable 
(inflammation or fibrosis) at 6 months will be taken as the baseline, and the increase or decrease  in the 
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.042variable at 12 months calculated = (% value at 12 months  minus % value at 6 months)/ (% value at 6 
months)
In addition,  we will perform  quantitative in situ hybridization for IL-6 mRNA  and protein expression on 
paraffin sections.  Frozen  or paraffin  sections  of the kidney biopsy will be stained  (by 
[CONTACT_31122]/ immunohistochemistry) for downstream IL-6 mediated inflammatory response 
genes (SAA2 and CRP), Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).    
For the measurement of urinary cytokines, urine samples  will be collected from enrolled patients on day 
0, monthly till the end of the treatment at [ADDRESS_94509] been reported to be elevated in the urine of 
patients with graft inflammation. PCR primers for these  genes are available  from Qiagen and a 
Sybrgreen-based real-time  PCR assay will be used to quantify the transcripts.
The primary endpoints are  
(a) A 40% decrease  in the quantity of inflammation between kidney biopsies at baseline and 6 months 
follow up as measured by [CONTACT_86599] “ti” scores and by [CONTACT_22123]-assisted quantitative image  analysis  of 
interstitial LCA (leukocyte common antigen)-positive cells. 
(b) The change in the quantity and fraction of macrophages (CD68 positive cells) and regulatory T cells 
(FoxP3 positive cells) in the inflammatory infiltrate,  as measured by [CONTACT_22123]-assisted quantitative 
image analysis, at baseline and 6 months  follow up.
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
13.1  Determination of Sample Size     
The main question is a comparison of proportion of subjects with persistent inflammation in group 1 
(standard of care)  vs. group 2 (TCZ  group).
The null hypothesis is:
Ho: The proportion of participants with persistent inflammation  at 6 months follow up in group 1 is the 
same as the proportion of participants  with persistent inflammation at 6 months follow up in group 2.
The alternative hypothesis is:
Tocilizumab in Renal  Allograft
27 April 2016  Version  11.043Ha: The proportion of participants with persistent inflammation at [ADDRESS_94510]-transplant 
immunosuppression will increase the probability of fibrosis, we nevertheless used  a two-tailed 
alternative hypothesis and set alpha at 0.05. Based  on a review of the relevant literature and our 
previous experience noted above, we anticipate that 50% of study participants randomized to group  1 
(standard of care group) will manifest persistent inflammation at 6 months follow up compared with  
10% of study participants  randomized to group 2 (TCZ group). We will have 83% power to detect an 
effect of this magnitude, i.e., a 40% absolute  difference between groups with a sample size of 24 per 
group, or a total N=48.  Once  consent  is obtained, patients will be randomized (1:1)  by [CONTACT_86629] 1 or group 2. 
13.2 Analysis of Study Endpoints
Continuous data will be expressed as mean +/- standard deviations and dichotomous data  as 
percentages. The chi-square test will be used  to examine differences in categorical  data  (e.g., incident  
acute rejections) and the Mann-Whitney  U-test to examine differences in continuous  variables (e.g. 
mean Banff scores)  between  groups as these variables  are not normally  distributed. To determine  
differences between  % of inflammation and change in % inflammation and fibrosis,  comparison 
between groups will be made with a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, depending on the distribution of 
the data).  We will consider P values of 0.[ADDRESS_94511]  2 years after  the investigation is completed.

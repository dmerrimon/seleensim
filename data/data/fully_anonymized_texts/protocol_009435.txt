Purpose : 
Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) was first described three decades ago as an 
intervention to protect vital organs from ischemic injury. RIPC occurs when a tissue is 
made transiently ischemic (5 minutes) for repeated bouts (5 times) prior to the longer 
ischemic insult. Recently it has been shown exercise performance and motor function are 
improved in young, healthy individuals when RIPC is perfo rmed on the arm or leg using 
a simple blood pressure cuff to occlude blood flow to the limb. The application of RIPC to 
individuals with reduced functional capacity, however, is largely unexplored. [CONTACT_244438]’s 
group was the first to apply RIPC to chronic stroke survivors with reduced physical 
function, and two weeks of RIPC increases walking speed, paretic muscle strength and 
fatigue resistance. Advanced age and cancer are both dramatic accelerators of frailty and 
frail patients have poor surgical outcomes . Therefore, we propose to apply this non -
invasive, simple intervention as a “prehabiliative” therapy to elderly patients with colon 
cancer during the perioperative period.  
 
Previous Findings and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476] : 
RIPC is a safe, well -tolerated, cost -effective, and easy to administer stimulus that has 
been shown to improve motor function and muscle performance in healthy 
individuals.   [CONTACT_244438]'s work in chronic stroke survivors with low physical function 
demonstrates that two weeks of RIPC improves muscle stren gth and increases self -
selected walking speed.   Exercise prehabilitation programs have shown positive effects 
on physical function in the preoperative period in patients scheduled for abdominal 
surgery; however elderly, frail colon cancer patients may not have the capacity to exercise 
at intensities required to derive physiological benefit, and adherence to exercise programs 
is generally low. The effects of RIPC to improve functional capacity in elderly frail cancer 
patients is unknown, as is the applicatio n of RIPC as a prehabilitative intervention prior to 
surgery in the elderly.  
 
Hypothesi s and Aims : 
We hypothesize that daily RIPC for 2 weeks will decrease frailty in elderly colon cancer 
patients prior to surgery.  
Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of  RIPC to decrease frailty in the preoperative 
period.  RIPC will decrease frailty as evidenced by [CONTACT_67191] 6MWT distance in pre -
surgical colon cancer patients compared to standard of care colon cancer patients.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Investigate whether RIPC improves functional recovery postoperatively.  
Frail colon cancer patients who undergo RIPC in the preoperative period will exhibit 
decreased frailty assessed by [CONTACT_941] 6MWT [ADDRESS_737946] 
of care patients.  
 
Inclusion Criteria : 
- be between ages of [ADDRESS_737947] a diagnosis of non -metastatic colon cancer  
- be scheduled for curative resection of non -metastatic colon cancer  
 
Exclusion Criteria : 
- condition which prevents walking  
- any condition in which compression of the arm or tran sient ischemia is contraindicated 
(e.g. wounds in the arm)  
- neurodegenerative disorder  
- unstable angina in previous month  
- MI during previous month  
 
Procedures : 
1.  A member of the study team  will pre -screen patients who fit the study criteria by [CONTACT_561542]. Ludwig, Ridolfi and Peterson daily in Epic  
2.  When a potentially eligible patient is identified via Epic, the study team member will 
contact [CONTACT_6283]. Ludwig, Ridolfi and Peterson via email prior to the clinic visit.   If the patient 
is identified as a surgical candidate by [CONTACT_11065], the surgeon will introduce the study 
team member to the patient at the conclusion of their surgical consult visit.  
 
3.  The study team member will explain the study to the patient in an u noccupi[INVESTIGATOR_561535].  
 
4.  After obtaining consent, the next contact [CONTACT_561543] -person at the patient's pre admission testing (PAT) visit (standard of care for colon 
cancer patients), which will be approximately 3 weeks prior to planned surgery.   At the 
conclusion of the patients PAT clinical visit, a study team member will measure 1) [ADDRESS_737948], 2) [ADDRESS_737949], 3) handgrip strength, 4) timed up and go 
test.  These measures will all either be collected in the hallway of the PAT clinic area, or 
in the case of handgrip and timed up and go, in an unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_561536].   The time 
to conduct all tests  is approximately 15 -20 minutes.  
 
5.  If the patient's [ADDRESS_737950] distance is <80% of their age predicted 
distance  [Predicted distance in 6 minutes (meters) = 868 – (age x 2.9) – (sex x 74.7) 
where age is in years and “1” is assigned for females an d “0” is assigned for males.], they 
will continue in the study.   If their [ADDRESS_737951] distance is >80% of their age 
predic ted norm, they will not be considered "frail" and will be excluded from the study.  
 
6.  After baseline measures of frailty are collected, the study participants will be 
randomized to receive either remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) or standard of care  
 
7.  Participants in the RIPC group will be given a handheld blood pressure cuff and 
instructions how to perform the RIPC proc edure at home, daily, until their follow -up 
appointment prior to surgery  
 
8.  A member of the study team will call the study participants in the RIPC group [ADDRESS_737952] re -evaluated at the 2nd floor Outpatient Rehabilitation Gym (Room 2112)  by a member 
of the study team.   This wi ll be the conclusion of the intervention period for patients in the 
RIPC group.  
 
10.  Blood pressure variability data from the surgical procedure will be acquired from the 
anesthetic record   
 
11.  Participants will return to the 2nd floor Outpatient Rehabilitation Gym  approximately [ADDRESS_737953] re -evaluated by a member of the study team.   This will complete 
all study procedures.  
 
-----------------------------------------------------  
 
Individual Procedures:  
 
1.  Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC):     A handheld sphygmomanometer 
(Hokason  DS400) and blood pressure cuff (Hokanson SC12) will be given to study 
participants in the RIPC group.   To perform RIPC, the cuff will be inflated to 225 mmHg 
for 5 minutes on the non -dominant upper arm, then released for a 5 -minute recovery 
period.   Five cycles of inflation/recovery will be performed daily.   Each participant must 
demonstrate competence completing a single cycle of inflation/deflation independently to 
continue with the study. To monitor compliance, participants must complete daily log 
sheet s documenting the time and maximum pressure of each cuff inflation.   The research 
coordinator will also place phone calls on days 3, [ADDRESS_737954] (6MWT):   The [ADDRESS_737955], or stop as needed. Participants will rate their level of fatigue before and after the 
walk using the 10 -point Borg scale of perceived fatigue.   After baseline testing, the 
percent of age - and sex -specific predicted distance will be calculated using the following 
equation:  
 
Predicted distance in 6 minutes (meters) = 868 – (age x 2.9) – (sex x 74.7) where age is 
in years and “1” is assigned for females and “0” is assigned for males.48  
 
Since our goal is to examine the effects of RIPC on frail colon cancer patients, only 
participants who cover a distance ≤80% of the age - and sex -predicted norms  will be 
included in the study.   Others have shown that pre -surgical colon cancer patients walk 65 
– 74% of age - and sex -specific norms during the 6MWT.    
 
3.  [ADDRESS_737956] (10MWT):  The 10 MWT is a validated measure to assess self -
selected walking sp eed, considered by [CONTACT_561544] “6th vital sign”.   Slow walking speed has 
also been identified as one of five metrics which identify frailty, and is a strong predictor 
of adverse outcomes associated with frailty.   In a hallway, participants will walk at their 
comfortable speed for 20 meters and be timed during meters 5 -15 using a stopwatch to 
assess steady -state walking.   10MWT measures will be done in triplicate.  
 
4.  Handgrip Strength (HGS):   Weak HGS has also been identified as a metric to identify 
frail pat ients.   Patients with weak HGS are six times more likely to be frail, and HGS 
positively correlates with self -perceived fatigue, disability, morbidity, and 
mortality.   Participants will squeeze a hydraulic hand dynamometer as hard as they can 
three times w ith their dominant hand and the maximal force generated will be recorded.  
 
5.  Timed up and Go (TUG):   TUG is the time it takes a person to stand from an armed 
chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back, and sit back down.   Increased time 
during the TUG test has also been shown to be a sensitive and specific measure of frailty 
in elderly patients.  
 
6.  Intraoperative Blood Pressure Variability:   We will query the Clinical Research 
Database Warehouse at the Medical College of Wisconsin and intraoperati ve blood 
pressure measurements will be extracted for each study participant. No other patient 
identifiers or clinical data will be revealed. BPV will be assessed as the product of 
magnitude x duration of SBP excursions outside the SBP range (>135 mmHg or < 95 
mmHg; area under the curve).   
 
Statistical Analysis : 
All statistical analysis will be overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sergey Tarima, Ph.D. (Co -
I).  Randomization of frail, pre -surgical colon cancer patients to the two intervention 
groups will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tarima  using randomized block designs (randomly 
chosen block sizes of 3, 6 and 9).   [CONTACT_561553] will work directly with a member of the study 
team. When a study participant is enrolled, he or she will receive a sequential number 
which will have a randomization sc hedule assigned to it (i.e. no intervention or RIPC), 
and this will be communicated to the study team.  
 
Statistical analysis for the primary study outcome, the change in [ADDRESS_737957] 
distance in the pre -surgical period,  will be based on the analysis of covariance model 
(ANCOVA) with two predictors: group membership (RIPC vs. no intervention control) an d 
the baseline value of 6MWT. To investigate power properties, we used a two -sample t -
test (under the assumption that there will be no baseline effect of 6MWT). We plan to 
enroll [ADDRESS_737958] to follow -up based on 
an estimated attrition rate of 10 -15% during the preoperative period. Thus, 42 patients 
will be available for comparing the intervention (RIPC) and control groups. Power 
calculations for a two sample t -test on [ADDRESS_737959] a change in 6MWT distance of 30 meters from baseline to 48 hours pre -surgery 
between the groups with 82% power (SD=46 meters from literature review).   A difference 
of ≥[ADDRESS_737960] of car e 
groups.    We will apply variance stabilizing transformations (natural logarithm or square 
root) to make ANCOVA residuals more normal if needed. If these transformations are not 
sufficient, we will proceed with a Mann -Whitney test. When we add 5% to 40 (a symptotic 
relative efficiency of Mann -Whitney to t -test is 96% under normality), then the Mann -
Whitney test (a nonparametric alternative to the two -sample t -test) with [ADDRESS_737961] -surgery will 
be conducted  relying on variance stabilizing transformations and ANCOVA; however, the 
power calculations change. We expect to lose approximately [ADDRESS_737962], the detectable difference in 6MWT distance at 82% 
power between the groups is 0.[ADDRESS_737963] a 
difference between the groups of ≥[ADDRESS_737964], the detectable 
difference at 76% power between the groups is 0.[ADDRESS_737965] deviations difference the power will be 87%. If the number of subjects with all 
blood pressure data between the upper and lower boundaries (meaning blood pressure 
variability = 0) is higher than 5, we will rely on exact Mann -Whitney test.  
 
Risks :  
1. Remote Ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC): there is a risk that the repeated oc clusions 
of blood flow to arm during the RIPC protocol may cause tingling and numbness in the 
arm or hand during the cuff inflation period which may be uncomfortable for the study 
participants.   
2. Clinical test of frailty: Study participants may feel tire d during the 6MWT and there is a 
risk that patients could fall during either the 6M WT, [ADDRESS_737966] (TUG).   
 
3. Adverse event during 6MWT: there is a small chance that study participants could have 
a cardiovascular event during the 6MWT.   
 
4. Loss  of confidentiality  
 
Safeguarding Against Risks : 
1. RIPC: any discomfort related to the occlusion of blood flow to the arm during the RIPC 
should be minor and transient based on our experience performing the p rotocol.   Based 
on our experience performing the procedure, and a multitude of other studies which have 
performed RIPC, we do not anticipate any issues with study participants performing the 
procedures at home.   
2. Clinical tests of frailty:   There is a ve ry minimal risk of falling during the walking tests or 
the timed up and go test.   The test administrators will provide contact [CONTACT_561545] a gait belt can be worn by [CONTACT_561546].   Participants may feel  fatigued during the [ADDRESS_737967]: Although risk of a sudden cardiac event in 
response to moderate intensity exercise (50 -60% target heart rate) in elderly colon cancer 
patients is relatively rare, we have taken several measures to safeguard th e health of our 
participants. First, all participants will be carefully screened by [CONTACT_561547] 
(Drs. Ridolfi, Peterson or Ludwig) prior to exercise to determine the risk of an adverse 
response to exercise (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension or elevated resting vital signs). 
Blood pressure and resting heart rate will also be measured by [CONTACT_18854]. Nguyen (clinical 
research assistant) immediately prior to beginning the 6MWT.   Second, we will follow the 
guidelines for conducting the [ADDRESS_737968] not had unstable angina or a 
myocardial infarction in the previous month, that participants resting heart rate is below 
120 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure  is less than 180 mmHg, and diastolic blood 
pressure is less than 100 mmHg. The sites of 6MWT measurements [Peroperative 
Testing Clinic (baseline) and 2nd floor Outpatient Rehab Gym  ([ADDRESS_737969] -surgery)] are equipped with Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), have 
physicians present at all times, and all members of the study team are certified in basic 
life support.   We will immediately terminate the [ADDRESS_737970] if participants 
experience any of the following: chest pain, intolerable dyspnea, leg cramps, staggering, 
diaphoresis, or they develop a pale or ashen appearance.   
 
4. Loss of Confidentiality: All personal information and protected health information will 
be collected and stored in a locked file cabinet in [CONTACT_244438]’s office. Only necessary 
research staff will have access to the personal information collected from the patients and 
access will be supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Durand. Each participant w ill be assigned a code and 
the data will be filed according to code.  
 
Informed Consent : 
The informed consent process will take place in the Colorectal Surgery Clinic at Froedtert 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We will allow a minimum of [ADDRESS_737971] related p rocedure will 
occur 2 -3 weeks prior to the participant's scheduled date of surgery.  
 
Throughout the informed consent process, the study team member will continuously ask 
if the subject has any questions or concerns. The study team member will verbally stre ss 
the right of the individual to stop at any time, and that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_561537].

CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH  
A1. INTRODUCTION – WHY ARE WE ASKING YOU TO PARTICIPATE?  
You are being invited to participate in this research because you have been diagnosed with 
colon cancer and are a candidate for surgery. Because of your condition, you may be eligible for 
a research study that will exam ine the effects of a non -invasive procedure, called ischemic 
preconditioning (IPC), on your physical fitness and mobility before and after surgery.  
 
A total of about [ADDRESS_737977] TO PARTICIPATE?  
You can decide whether to take part in this research or not. You are free to say yes or no.  If you 
say no, your regular medical care will not change.  Even if you join this project, you do not have 
to sta y in it. You may stop at any time.  
A3. WHY IS THIS PROJECT BEING DONE?  
IPC is a procedure that reduces blood flow to a part of the body for a short time using a cuff, 
similar to when you have your blood pressure taken. In IPC, when the blood flow is restored, the 
cells in that part of the body are protected when blood supply is stopped in the future, leading to 
improvement in muscle performanc e. People who are being treated for cancer and are 
undergoing surgery can have decreased physical fitness and increased complications after 
surgery. In this study, we want to see if preparing for surgery (‘prehabilitating’) using IPC can 
improve physical f itness and reduce complications after surgery.  
 
B1. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARTICIPATE?  
You will be “randomized” into one of two study groups. One group will receive the intervention, 
and another group will not. Randomization means that you are put into a g roup by [CONTACT_3364]. It is 
like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either group. Neither you 
nor the research doctor can choose what group you will be in.  
 
All study procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_7628]. If you feel any discomfort or 
have any questions during any of your testing procedures, please let a member of the research 
team know right away. You can stop being in the study at any time.  With some of the testing 
procedures you will be able to rest if you get tired and continue to participate.  
 
1. Clinical assessments: A research team member will have you perform various clinical 
assessments that measure your strength, walking distance, walk ing speed, and mobility.  
 
• There will be 3 total sessions involving these assessments: 3 weeks before surgery, 
within 4 days before surgery, and 4 weeks after surgery. Each session takes 
approximately 20 minutes to complete.  
 
2. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC ): We want to measure if preventing blood flow to your arm 
for short bouts will improve your physical fitness after you have surgery. If you are randomly 
assigned to this group, you will be given instructions on how to perform this protocol at 
home, daily,  during the 2 -3 weeks leading up to the surgery.  
 
• You will place a blood pressure cuff around your arm and inflate it to a pressure high 
enough to stop blood flow to your arm.  
 
• The cuff will be inflated for 5 minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes. This  will be 
done 5 times for a total time of 45 minutes per session.  
 
• You can do this any time of the day.  You will be given worksheets to document the 
times you do it.  
 
B2. HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE PROJECT?  
You will be in this research project for about [ADDRESS_737978]?   
You are free to withdraw from the project at any time. If you leave, your regular medical care will 
not change. If you decide to leave the project, please let the research team know.  
 
The research doctor may stop your participation in the project at any time for any reason without 
your consent. He will tell you if t his happens.  
 
C1. WHAT HEALTH RISKS OR PROBLEMS CAN I EXPECT FROM THE PROJECT?  
We watch everyone in the project for unexpected problems  or side effects.  You need to tell the 
research  doctor  or a member of the research team immediately if you experience  any 
problems , side effects, or changes in your health . 
 
1. There may be temporary numbness and tingling sensations in the arm while the 
blood pressure cuff is inflated for 5 minutes.  
• The discomfort with the inflated blood pressure cuff is generally minor and stops 
once the cuff is deflated.  
• If the pain persists, please tell the research team and we will stop the procedures.  
 
2.  You may feel tired during the clinical tests, and there is  a risk of falling while 
performing some of the clinical tests.   
• The research team will provide assistance while you walk and use a walking belt if 
necessary.  
• You will be encouraged to proceed at your own pace, and there will be chairs where 
the test is located so you can sit and rest if needed.  
 
3. There is a risk that you could have heart problems during the walking tests.  
• Risk of a sudden heart problem in response to mild exercise like walking is relatively 
rare in colon cancer patients. However, we hav e taken several measures to 
safeguard your health.  
▪ First, all you will be carefully screened by [CONTACT_561548] a negative response to exercise (e.g., uncontrolled blood pressure, 
history of heart disease or elevated resting vital signs).  
▪ Second, all testing sessions will be performed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_561540].  
▪ Third, we will follow guidelines for conducting the test set by [CONTACT_345262].  
▪ Finally, we will stop the testing if you begin to show signs such as pain, 
difficulty breathing, excessive sweating, and/or paleness at a ny time during 
the test.  
 
Another risk may be loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep your research 
records confidential but we cannot guarantee it. Depending on the kind of information being 
collected, if your research information were  accidentally seen, it might be used in a way that 
could embarrass you or affect your ability to get insurance. If you have questions, you can talk 
to the project director about whether this could apply to you.  
 
To help us protect your privacy, we have o btained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
National Institutes of Health. The study team can use this Certificate to legally refuse to disclose 
information that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, 
legisl ative, or other proceedings, for example, if there is a court subpoena. The study team will 
use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you.  
 
C3. ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE PROJECT?  
This project may or ma y not help you, but we hope the information from this project will help us 
develop a better routine to prepare patients before they have surgery.  
 
D1. ARE THERE ANY COSTS TO BEING IN THE PROJECT?  
There are no costs to you for any of the visits or services  you receive in this project.  Costs for 
the routine medical care to treat your condition are not part of this project and will be billed to 
you/your insurer. If you have questions regarding costs, please contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Durand.  
 
D2. WILL I BE PAID FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROJECT?  
You will receive $100 for each visit that involves testing. If all 3 sessions are completed, you will 
be compensated a total of $300. To pay you, we need your social security number. Any 
payment may be reportable  as income on your taxes.  
 
D3. WHAT OTHER HEALTHCARE CHOICES DO I HAVE?  
You do not have to join this project. You are free to say yes or no.  Whether or not you join this 
project, your usual medical services will not change.  
 
D4. WILL I BE GIVEN NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT?  
If we learn any important new information about the intervention that might change your mind 
about being in the project, we will tell you about it right away. You can then decide if you want to 
stay in the proj ect. 
 
D5. WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM INJURED BECAUSE I TOOK PART IN THE PROJECT?  
Emergency medical treatment for injuries directly related to your participation in this research 
project will be provided to you. You or your health insurance will be billed for th e costs of this 
emergency treatment.  MCW will decide on a case by [CONTACT_561549].  If your research -related injury requires medical 
care beyond this emergency treatment, you or your insu rer will be responsible for the costs of 
this follow -up care.  
 
At this time, there is no plan for any additional financial payments.

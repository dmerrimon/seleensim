Title of Study: Exploring the Experience of Using a Prayer Mobile App Date: 11/6/22   
Study Protocol  Research Question:  What are the feasibility and preliminary effects of using Pray.com on spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being and mental health (stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms)  in racial ethnic minority adults (i.e., individuals who identify as Black/African American, Latinx/Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, or Multiracial)?   Hypothesis:  Individuals who use the Pray.com app will report that they are satisfied with the app, will use the app, and will report improved spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being and reductions in mental health indices (stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms).  Outcomes:  Primary outcome: Feasibility (i.e., acceptability, demand, practicality) Secondary outcomes: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being, satisfaction with life, religious commitment, racial/ethnic identity, stress, depression/anxiety  Measures:  Feasibility questions  • Acceptability (satisfaction, intent to continue use, perceived appropriateness, fit within culture) • Demand (actual use, expressed interest, perceived demand) • Practicality (ease or difficulty of use, ability to use app, cost analysis) Well-being Spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being scale (SWBS) Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) Multi-ethnic identity measure (MEIM) Religious commitment inventory (RCI) Mental health Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) Miscellaneous items Demographics  Sample size and inclusion criteria:  N = 75 (main study) Subsample n = 15 (qualitative interviews)  Participants will be recruited through social media and various organizations that serve racial/ethnic minorities. Participants will be over the age of 18 and identify as a racial/ethnic minority (i.e., individuals who identify as Black/African American, Latinx/Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, or Multiracial). Participants also must be willing to participate in a study that involves engaging in a regular Christian religious practice and are willing to download the Pray.com app.   
Procedure:  Eligible participants will be given the Pray.com app and directed to use it daily. At the end of the study, a subsample of participants (N = 15) will be randomly asked to participate in an interview.   Participants will complete measures at baseline (i.e., time 1) and four-weeks (i.e., time 2). Participants will be compensated for their time completing surveys at baseline ($15) and post ($25) intervention for a total of $40 at the end of the intervention. Participants who complete the qualitative interview portion of the study will receive an additional $40. Participants who complete both surveys will also be entered in a drawing at the end of the intervention to win one of three $[ADDRESS_205822] of time on the dependent variables. We will also check for moderation with key variables (e.g., religious commitment, racial/ethnic identity). The main hypothesis is that participants will report high levels of acceptability, demand, and practicality after using the app.   Informed Consent Form   BIOLA UNIVERSITY CONSENT TO ACT AS A HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANT  Exploring the Experience of Using a Prayer Mobile App  Lead Researcher Todd W.

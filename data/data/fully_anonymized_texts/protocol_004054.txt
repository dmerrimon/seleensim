Original protocol  17-Mar-2017  
Amendment 4 (14-Aug-2018) 
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria  set forth in Article  10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the  Council of the European 
Union  (32).  
Overall rationale for the amendment  
The main reason for the amendment is  that a new anti-drug antibodies (ADA) assay  has been 
developed with improved tralokinumab tolerance . This means that  the presence or absence of 
ADA  can be determi ned in serum samples with tralokinumab  present . Previously, t his was not 
possible and therefore ADA sampling at the end of the 14-week off-treatment safety follow -up 
was originally required for the ADA evaluation.  Thus, th e new ADA assay  will allow eligible 
subjects who have completed the treatment periods of trial LP0162 -1326 to continue into the 
long-term extension trial (conducted under a separate protocol [LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND]) 
without completing the safety follow -up period  in the present trial . These subjects will have 
their safety follow -up period after end -of-treatment in the long -term extension trial.   
In addition, the amendment includes other changes, as presented in the table below.  
Note:  The table below describes the changes in each sectio n. Changes have either been 
summarised (written with plain text only) or marked as tracked changes ( text added to the 
protocol is written in bold  and deleted text has a line through it ).

Minimum requirement is a calibrated 
min/max thermometer.   To clarify that the storage of 
IMP will be monitored.  
Section  9.9.[ADDRESS_531682] for  such IMP destruction ; this requires 
that the trial site is able to issue a certificate 
documenting the kit number(s) that were 
destroyed . 
Trial sites which do not have such IMP 
destruction procedures in place will dispose 
used syringes in sharps bins which will be 
shipped to the contract manufacturing 
organisation (CMO)  at the end of the trial . 
For more information about IMP 
accountability, please refer to the IMP  
manual.  To clarify that a certificate of 
destruction is not required 
for used IMP.

Collection of 
adverse events;  AEs must be collected from time of first trial -
related activity after the subject has signed 
the informed consent form until completion 
of the clinical trial (defined as the safety 
follow -up visit [ADDRESS_531683] injection ).  
For subjects entering the long-term 
extension trial ( LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND ), 
any (S)AE with o nset before the final visit 
in LP0162 -1326  should be reported in 
LP0162 -1326 . If ongoing, the (S)AE will 
also be recorded as medical history in 
ECZTEND . To clarify how (S)AEs 
occurring in subjects 
entering ECZTEND will be 
collected if visits in

(Footnote  1) The additional data to be recorded in the 
eCRF are not a requirement, but are to be 
reported by [CONTACT_093], if available, 
for example as part of standard clinical 
practice.  To clarify that additional 
information is to be provided 
only if available and is not a 
requirement.  
Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_531685] (AESIs) 
will be tabulated and listed instead of being 
presented in a narrative  Tabulation and listings are 
considered a more practical 
and informative way of 
presenting data on AESIs. 
This will enable easier 
overview of the individual 
cases as well as sorting and 
pooling of data from several  
trials.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
Anti-drug 
antibodies  Evaluations of nAB will be conducted on 
those serum samples that test positive for 
ADA. The test sample is deemed positive or 
negative for the presence of nAb to 
tralokinumab relative to a pre -determined (in 
assay validation), statistically deri ved cut 
point. Samples positive for nAb to 
tralokinumab are then titrated to determine 
relative amounts of nAb present in each test 
sample.  To reflect that titre 
information will not be 
available from the nAB 
assay.

5 Introduction and r ationale  
5.1 Atopic dermati tis 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may affect up to 20% of 
children and up to 10% of adults. In its severe form, AD is characterised by [CONTACT_421439], intractable itch, as well as enhanced susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal skin 
infections ( 1-4). AD is associated with a substantial patient burden that typi[INVESTIGATOR_421406], sleep disturbance, and reductions in work productivity ( 5). 
Treatment recommendations for AD include topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491], the main being topi[INVESTIGATOR_030] (TCS). Unfortunately, TCS and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (TCIs) have 
limited eff icacy in pat ients with moderate -to-severe disease. TCS  and non-biologic systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_421407] -term use (6-8). 
AD is characterised by [CONTACT_421440] T -helper -2 (Th2) pathway with increased skin expression 
of key Th2 cytokines including interleukin  (IL)-13 (9, 10). The expression of IL -13 is 
increased in lesional skin compared to non -lesional skin, and the proportion of CD4+ and 
CD8+ cells expressing IL -13 is upregulated in AD patients compared to individuals without 
AD (9, 11).  
IL-13 acts on keratinocytes to release C-C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22) and recruit more 
IL-13 expressing Th2 cells, decrease differentiation, and contribute to decreased barrier 
function ( 12). IL-13 also drives immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and contributes to mast 
cell activation status and, once allergen cross -links IgE on the cell surface, driv es histamine 
release and induces itch (13, 14). Indeed, itch is a key i ssue in AD, which drives significant 
mechanical damage to the skin and further facilitates allergen and pathogen entry.  
All of these effects together drive and exacerbate the disease phenotype. A review  of the 
available preclinical literature from mouse a nd human ex  vivo models suggests IL-13 as a, if 
not the, central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. Indeed, there is evidence that blocking the 
IL-4 receptor (which is part of the receptor complex which also binds IL -13) with the 
monoclonal antibody dupi[INVESTIGATOR_421408] ( 15).

Tralokinumab is a  human  recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that 
specifically binds to human IL -13 and blocks interaction with the IL -13 receptors ( 16-18). A 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_421409]  (PK)  
is given in the current Investigator ’s Brochure.  
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.[ADDRESS_531716] s. Furth er information on these trials can be found in the current Investigator ’s 
Brochure.  
In a phase 2b trial (D2213C00001), adults with moderate -to-severe AD on a background of 
mild to moderate TCS, were treated with 3 different regimens of tralokinumab (45 mg every 
second week [Q2W ], 150 mg Q2W , or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy over a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary endpo ints were change from 
baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) at Week 12 and the percentage of 
subjects achieving IGA response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 12. Secondary 
endpoints included change from baseline in EASI and Scoring Atop ic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) 
score s, the percentage of subjects achieving at least 50% reduction from baseline in EASI and 
SCOR AD score s (EASI50 and SCORAD 50). In the overall intent -to-treat phase 2b 
population, an improvement in EASI score at Week 12 was seen in the tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W group versus placebo. 26% of subjects achieved an IGA of 0 or 1 in the tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W group versus 12% in the place bo group. The most commonly reported causally 
related treatment -emergent adverse event was upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (6  [3.9%] 
subjects in the combined tralokinumab group [45 mg, 150  mg, and 300  mg] and 2  [3.9%] 
subjects in the placebo group).  
In total, more than 2,[ADDRESS_531717] been treated with  tralokinumab (cut -off date: 
18-Aug-2017) based on actual exposure data from any completed clinical trials and the
enrolment/randomisation schemes for ongoing trials.  The safety of all doses studied so f ar has 
been with an acceptable benefit -risk profile and no major safety concerns have been 
identified.  Possible risks associated with use of tralokinumab are summarised in Section  5.5. 
5.3 Trial rationale  
The purpose of this phase 3 trial is to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of 
tralokinumab monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with moderate -to-severe AD 
inadequately controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_1252]. Such subjects  would be candidates for 
systemic therapy.   
The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that tralokinumab provides more effective 
control of the skin manifestations of AD than placebo. The trial will evaluate the percentage 
of subjec ts achieving IGA response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and the percentage of 
subjects achieving at least 75% reduction in EASI score (EASI75) at Week 16, with 
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0

Page 28 of 156 
secondary endpoints addressing symptom scores and extent of AD (SCORAD ), itch severity , 
and health -related quality of life  (HQoL)  measures related to AD.  
As AD is a chronic disease requiring long -term treatment, it is also relevant to evaluate th e 
efficacy of tralokinumab as maintenance treatment. After the 16 -week initial treatment period , 
the trial will evaluate 2  different treatment options for maintenance therapy (300 mg Q2W an d 
300 mg every 4  weeks [ Q4W ]).  
The trial will further characterise the benefit -risk profile of the drug and understand how bes t 
to position tralokinumab in the AD treatment pathway.  
5.4 Justification for dose  
The selected dose for the initial treatment period in trial is subcutaneously administered 
300 mg traloki numab Q2W. All subjects randomis ed to receive treatment with tralokinumab 
will get an initial loading dose of  600 mg on D ay 0 (baseline). The administration of the 
loading dose of tralokinumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach steady -state faster , 
and potentially reduce the time to onset of clinical effect. The serum concentrations of 
tralokinumab after  the 600 mg loading dose will not exceed the serum tralokinumab 
concentrations at steady state for the 300 mg Q2W.  
The tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W dose was chosen based on the results of the phase 2b trial in 
subjects with moderate to severe AD (trial D2213C00 001) described in Section  5.2. The 
subjects were treated with 3 different fixed dose regimens o f tralokinumab (45, 150, or 
300 mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate safet y and efficacy over a treatment period of 12  weeks. 
In the overall intention -to-treat phase 2b population, a statistically significant improvement in 
EASI change from baseline at Week 12 was observed in the tralokinumab 300 mg group 
versus placebo; however , formal statistical significance was not demonstrated for the 
co-primary endpoint IGA. The key secondary and exploratory endpoint results from 
trial D2213C00001 also support the selection of the tralokinumab Q2W 300 mg dose  for 
phase 3 development;  and ov erall, larger numerical differences were observed for [ADDRESS_531718] of the trial endpoints.  
Since the safety profile in trial D2213C00001 was acceptable in all treatment cohorts and no 
clear safety related dose -response pattern was identified, the dose of 300 mg Q2W has been 
selected for evaluation in this trial .  
In the maintenance  treatment  period , 1 of the treatment arms will be dosed with tralokinumab 
Q4W. This approach will allow the sponsor of the trial, LEO Pharma A/S (hereinafter

“LEO ”), to establish whether less frequent dosing of tralokinumab may be sufficient for long -
term maintenance of efficacy.  
5.5 Benefit/ risk assessmen t 
There is an unmet medical need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_421410] -to-severe 
AD as current immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine , methotrexate, and 
azathioprine , have associated long -term toxicities.  
Tralokinumab has alread y demonstrated efficacy in both moderate -to-severe AD as well a s in 
a severe asthma population in phase [ADDRESS_531719] been identified that are described in the current Investigator’s Brochure , 
including hypersensitivity reactions, immune complex disease, severe infections , 
malignancies, an d interference with reproductive function ; measures are in place in this trial 
to protect participating subjects as follows:  
Close monitoring of subjects during the trial with trial visits every 2 weeks
during the treatment period as described in the SoP ( Section 4). Where
home -use is appropriate  (open -label treatment only) , trial visits will be
scheduled every 4 weeks.
Close monitoring of subjects during the post -dosing period (at the first
[ADDRESS_531720] [ IMP] dosing visits  in initial treatment
period and in open -label treatment ) as a precautionary measure aga inst
hypersensitivity reactions  (further details are given in Section  9.2).
Monitoring of s ubjects for clinical manifestations that may be associated with
the development of specific antibodies to tralokinumab (i .e., immune complex
disease) .
Exclusion of subjects with untreated systemic helminth infestations or subjects
who have failed to respond to standard of care therapy ( neutralisation of IL -13
might theoretically cause a worsening of parasitic infestation, in particular,
prevent ion of expulsion of gastrointestinal worms (helminths) [28])
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 30 of 156 
Exclusion of s ubjects  with a history of tuberculosis  requiring treatment within
12 months prior to the screening visit .
Exclusion of s ubjects with a history of a clinically significant inf ection
(defined as a systemic or serious skin infection requiring parenteral antibiotics,
antiviral, or ant i-fungal medication; see Section  8.3) within 4 weeks pri or to
baseline which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335] ’s medical expert ,
may compromise the safety of the su bject in the trial .
In conclusion, previous clinical experience with tralokinumab shows no major safety or 
tolerability concerns and ap propriate measures have been instituted in this trial to protect 
subjects from possible risks that have been previously identified and to closely monitor each 
subject. The current risk/benefit ratio is favourable  and supports the administration of

Altogether, the risks associated with participating in this clinical trial are considered ve ry low 
and outweighed by [CONTACT_73292] a potential future treatment option for moderate -to-severe 
AD. Moreover,  75% of the subjects will be randomi sed to active treatment with tralokinumab 
in the initial treatment phase and those who do not achieve a clinical response at Week  16 
(including subjects randomised to placebo) will be treated with open -label tralokinumab  in the  
maintenance phase with a potential effect and benefit for the individual subject.

(Weeks  -6/-2 to 0), an initial treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks  0 to 16) and a maintenance 
treatment period of 36 weeks  (Weeks  16 to 52) . The last dose of IMP will be given at 
Week  50. The primary endpoint is assessed at Week 16, and the final efficacy assessment will 
be conducted at Week  52. A 14-week off -treatment follow -up period for the assessment of 
safety is also included  (Weeks  52 to 66) . Subjects not achieving a clinical respo nse at 
Week  16 as well as those who meet certain criteria durin g maintenance treatment will be  
transferred to  open -label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment with optional use of TCS  up to 
Week 52 . An overview of the different parts of the trial is provided in  Panel 1 and Panel 8. 
Screening period (Week -6 to Week 0)  
The screening period has a minimum duration of [ADDRESS_531726] duration of the screening period 
depends on the washout period  defined by [CONTACT_121566] ( Section  8.3). If a washout is 
not required, screening will be reduced to 2  weeks  and only requires 1  visit (Week  -2; visit  2), 
i.e., the 2  screening visits will be merged.  Similarly, if only a 2 -week wash -out is required,
screening visits 1 and 2 will be combined (Week  -2; visit  2). Eligibility will be assessed at the 
(first) screening visit and on Day  0 prior to randomisation.  
All s ubjects will attend a screening visit 14  days before baseline ( Week  -2; visit  2) where they 
will recei ve electronic diary ( eDiary ) training and start the eDiary. Data entered in the eDiary 
during the 2  weeks before randomisation will be used to calculate baseline values of the 
patient -reported outcomes (PROs).  
All subjects will use an emollient twice daily  (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before 
randomisation and will continue this treatment throughout the trial. Subjects will initiate 
emollient treatment no later than the Week  -2 visit.

Page 37 of 156 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to W eek 16)  
Following the screening period, approximate ly 780 subjects will be randomis ed 3:1 to one of 
the following groups stratified by [CONTACT_421443] (IGA of 3 or 4)  
Tralokinumab 600 mg (4  mL) at Day 0 (hereinafter “baseline ”), then 300 mg
(2 mL) Q2W .
Placebo (4  mL) at baseline , then placebo (2  mL) Q2W .
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52)  
Subjects achieving a clinical response  at Week 16 will continue into maintenance treatment 
that wil l continue until Week 52 (t he last dose of IMP will be given at Week 50 ). 
Clinical response  is defined as IGA of [ADDRESS_531727] 75% reduction in EASI score from 
baseline ( EASI75 ). 
Subjects randomis ed to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period will be re-randomised 
2:2:1 to one of the following Q2W maintenance regimens  stratified by [CONTACT_421444]  16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA >1) : 
Tralokinumab 300 mg (2  mL) (‘tralokinumab Q2W ’).
Alterna ting dose administrations tralokinumab 300 mg (2  mL) and p lacebo (2  mL)
(‘tralokinumab Q4W ’).
Placebo (2  mL).
Subjects randomis ed to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieve a clinical response 
at Week 16, defined by [CONTACT_421445] 0 or 1, or EASI75 will continue to receive placebo Q2W in the 
maintenance treatment period.  
Transfer to open -label  treatment   
Subjects will be transferred from maintenance treatment to open -label treatment 
(tralokinumab 300  mg Q2W with optional use of TCS ) if they meet the criteria listed below. 
Transfer to open -label may occur at any visit while the subject is in the maintenance treatment  
period  but no earlier than Week  22. 
Subjects with IGA=0 at Week 16 : 
IGA of at least [ADDRESS_531728] a 4 -week per iod (i.e., over
3 consecutive visits) .

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 38 of 156 
Subjects with IGA=1 at Week 16 : 
IGA of at least [ADDRESS_531729] a 4 -week period (i.e., over
3 consecutive visits) .
Subjects with IGA >1 at Week 16 : 
Not achieving EASI75 over at least a 4 -week period (i.e., over 3 consecutive visits) .
Subjects who are transferred to open -label treatment  will continue the ir scheduled visit 
sequence.  
Open -label treatment (Week 16 to Week 52)  
Any subject that does not achieve the protocol defined clinical response at Week 16 will be 
treated with open -label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional use of TCS. The open -label 
treatment will extend to Week 52 (the last dose of open -label treatment will be given at 
Week  50). 
For selected countries  
Subjects  transfer ring to open -label treatment  will have the option to self -administer 
tralokinumab – or have tralokinumab administered by a caregiver – in their home after 
adequate training by [CONTACT_421446] ’s discretion  (Section  9.2). This home -use will 
only commence after [ADDRESS_531730] ered at the trial site (i.e., 
starting no earlier than Week [ADDRESS_531731] transfe rred to open -label ) as 
a safety precaution for subjects receiving their first active therapy. After proper training  of the 
subject and/or the caregiver  that is, at [ADDRESS_531732] trial 
visits every 4 weeks. For subjects where home -use is inappropriate, tralokinumab will 
continue to be administered by [CONTACT_421447].  
Safety f ollow -up period (Week 52 to Week 66)  
All s ubjects , except for those who enter the long -term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, 
ECZTEND, see below ), will complete a 1 4-week off -treatment follow -up period for the 
assessme nt of safety and ADA at Week  66. 
Long -term extension trial  
Eligible subjects may be invited  to enter a long -term extension trial  conducted under a 
separate protocol (LP0162 -1337 , ECZTEND ). Subjects who transfer to ECZTEND must have 
had their last visit in the treatment period ( Week  52 [selected countries ] under the current 
protocol (LP0162 -1326).

7.2 Number of subjects needed  
Assuming a screen ing failure rate of 25%, approximately  1040  subjects will be screened and 
approximately 780 subjects will be randomly assigned to trial treatment in the initial 
treatment period ( 3:1; 585 subjects in the tralo kinumab arm and 195  subjects in the placebo 
arm) . At Week 16, a pproximately 40% of the tralokinumab treated subjects are expected to be 
re-randomised (2:2:1 to tralokinumab Q2W, tralokinumab Q4W , and placebo , respectively) 
into the maintenance treatment period ; any subject  who do es not achieve a clinical response at 
Week 16 will be treated with open -label tralokinumab Q2W.  
The statistical power considerations for this sample size (n=780) are described in 
Section  12.1. 
This trial will be conducted at approximately [ADDRESS_531733] completed all periods of the 
trial including the safety follow -up vi sit (Week  66). Subjects entering the long -term extension 
trial (LP0162 -1337 , ECZTEND) after completion of the end of treatment visit ( Week  52) will 
also be considered as trial completers.   
The end of the trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject in the trial

32.Employees of the trial site or any other individuals directly involved with the planni ng
or conduct of the trial, or immediate family members of such individuals.
8.4 Screening , screen ing failures, and ra ndomisation  
Trial  participation begins once writte n informed consent is obtained (see Appendix 4 B for 
details on the informed consent process). Once informed consent is obtained, a subject 
identification number (subject ID) will be assigned by a central interactive web response 
system  (IWRS)  and the screening evaluations to assess eligibility criteria  may begin . The 
subject ID will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout 
trial participation, if applicable.  A master log of all consented subjects will be main tained at 
the trial site.  
Screen ing failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the trial but are not 
subsequently randomly assigned to trial treatment. A minimal set of screen ing failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen ing failure subjects to meet 
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (C ONSORT) publishing requirements  (26) 
and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes 
demography, screen ing failure details, eligibility criteria, and any adverse events (AEs) and 
serious AEs (S AEs). Follow -up of SAEs must be carried out according to S ection  11.6.

Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen ing failure s) may 
not be re -screened. Howeve r, if the reason for screen ing failure is administrative and not d ue 
to the subject failing to meet the eligibility criteria, re -screening may be permitted (this  will 
require approval by [CONTACT_456] ’s medical expert  [INVESTIGATOR_421522] t he 
original screening visit in the electronic case report form [ eCRF ]). Individuals who are 
re-screened will get a new subject ID.  
The investigator will maintain a list of all randomised subjects at the trial site including  each 
subject ’s identity, date of  enrolment and corresponding subject ID so that any subject may b e 
identified if required for any reason. The list must not be copi[INVESTIGATOR_121482] . 
8.[ADDRESS_531745] may withdraw from trial or from treatment at any time (prior to first dose or during 
treatment period) at his/her own request. A subject may be withdrawn  at any time at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Discontinued subjects will not be replaced.  
Medical reasons for permanent disco ntinuation of IMP are giv en in S ection  9.8.1 . 
Assessments  
Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP for any reason will be asked to attend an early 
termination visit and  return to the trial  site for 1 or 2  additional visits as indicated below 
depending on the time of discontinuation of IMP  (see the SoP [Section  4] for data to be 
collected at these visits).  The investigator will review any AEs which will be followed -up 
according to Section  11.6, if the subject agrees.  
Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP prior to Week  16 will be asked to attend : 
Early termination visit.
Nominal Week 16 visit  (16 weeks after randomisation) .
Safety follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_531746] administration of IMP).
Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP at Week  16 or after Week 16 will be asked to 
attend :  
Early termination visit.
Safety follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_531747] administration of IMP).

not tested, and the investigator must d ocument this in the site ’s trial records.   
Reason(s) for discontinuation from IMP and withdrawal from the trial  must be recorded in the 
medical records and the eCRF  (lack of efficacy, AE, withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130], lost to follow -up, 
death, other) . For subject s randomised to IMP but not attending any post -baseline visits, it 
will be recorded whether any safety evaluations were performed after exposure to IMP.  
Lost to follow -up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled 
visits and if the trial site is not able to get in contact [CONTACT_1155] .  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the trial site for a required 
visit:  
The trial site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_421449]/or
should continue in the trial.
Before a subject is dee med lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] (where possible, [ADDRESS_531749] ’s last known mailing address or local
equivalent methods).  These contact [CONTACT_9300] ’s
medical record.
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, they will be considered to have
withdrawn from the trial with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.

(each 1.0  mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab or placebo to receive a total loading dose of 
600 mg tralokinumab or placebo  (4.0 mL) . 
At subsequent visits  (Q2W)  in the initial treatment period , each subject will receive  2 SC 
injections (each 1.0  mL) of 150  mg tralokinumab or placebo to receive a total dose of 300  mg 
tralokinumab or placebo .  
Subjects in the maintenance period will rece ive either  
Tralokinumab Q2W (2  SC injections [each 1.0  mL] of 150  mg tralokinumab) .
Tralokinumab Q4W (alternating dose  administrations 2  SC injections [each
1.0 mL] of 150  mg tralokinumab and placebo) .
Placebo (2  SC injections [each 1.0  mL] of placebo) .
Subjects who have been transferred to open -label treatment will receive 2  SC injections (each 
1.0 mL) of 150  mg tralokin umab at each dosing interval.  
Dosing visits are shown in the SoP ( Section  4). The last administration of IMP under this 
protocol will occur at Week  50. 
IMP will be administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional  (HCP; see 
Section  9.3.1  for blinding details) , or by [CONTACT_29159] ’s caregiver (open -label 
treatment only; selected countries) . A minimum interval of  [ADDRESS_531753] 3 IMP dosing visits  in both the initial treatment period (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4) 
and in open -label treatment , subjects will be monitored after IMP administration for

immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2  hours with vital signs taken every 30  minutes or 
until stable, whichever is later.  Vital signs will be documented in the eCRF.  
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World 
Allergy  Organization has categorised anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups : allergic anaphylaxis 
(mediated by [CONTACT_421450] ) and non allergic anaphylaxis (which has a 
nonimmunologic cause ) (30). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this trial are 
listed in Appendix 6  (34). Appropriate drugs, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, 
corticosteroids, etc ., and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylac tic reactions must be 
immediately available at trial sites, and trial personnel should be trained to recognise and 
respond to anaphylaxis according to local guidelines.  
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for 
analysis of serum tryptase  at the central laboratory.  
Conditions requiring IMP administration rescheduling  
If any of the following should occur, the investig ator should reschedule the visit and I MP 
should not be administered until the rescheduled visit:  
The subject has an intercurrent illness, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_421417] (e.g., viral illnesses) .
The subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C; ≥100.4 °F) within 72  hours prior to
IMP administration .
If the trial visit cannot be rescheduled in order to maintain minimum of 7 days to subsequent 
dose, the sponsor ’s medical expert  [INVESTIGATOR_73371][INVESTIGATOR_530] . 
Home -use 
Subjects  transferring to open -label treatment will have the option to self -administer 
tralokinumab – or have tralokinumab administered by a care giver – in their home after 
training  and at the investigator ’s discretion  (selected countries only) . Subjects who do not 
want to self -inject may have the staff at the trial site administer all the injections at the trial 
site.  
Subjects who are found eligible for home -use will have to provide additional informed 
consent  and home -use will only commence aft er [ADDRESS_531754] been 
administered at the trial site (i.e., starting no earlier than Week 22, see Section  7.1 and the SoP 
[Panel 4]).

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 51 of 156 
Prior to self -administration at home, the individual who will be administering the injections  
(i.e., the subject and/or the caregiver) will receive proper training  (that is, at 3 dosing vi sits 
during open -label treatment after additional consent has been obtained ) in SC injection 
technique and on procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency during or following 
home -use of tralokinumab . This training  will be conducted by [CONTACT_421451].  
The subject and/or the caregiver must also undertake SC administration under HCP 
supervision on one or more occasions such that the HCP is satisfied with the individual ’s 
understanding and confidence of the procedure.  
Subjects or their caregivers  will only self-administer tr alokinumab at home every 4  weeks, 
i.e., in weeks where no efficacy and safety assessments are scheduled (Panel 4; see also
Section  9.9.3 ). Where trial visits with efficacy and safety assessments are scheduled  (every 
4 weeks) , tralokinumab injections will be administered at the trial si te, preferably by [CONTACT_421452] , alternatively by [CONTACT_335555],  when all assessments  have been 
completed.   
At each trial visit it will be recorded in the eCRF whether tralokinumab was administered by  
[CONTACT_421453].  
9.[ADDRESS_531755] been found to comply with all the inclusion criteria and not to violate an y 
of the exclusion criteria will be randomised at baseline  (Day  0) to receive treatment with 
either tralokinumab or placebo in the initial tre atment period . Treatment assignment will be 
pre-planned according to a computer -generated randomisation schedule in a 3:1 ratio 
(tralokin umab:placebo)  stratified by [CONTACT_11338]  (North America, Europe, Australia, and Korea ) 
and b aseline disease severity (IGA  3 or 4).  
Subjects found to be eligible for maintenance treatment at Week 16 will be re -randomised to 
the maintenance treatment period in a 2:2:1 ratio (tralokin umab Q2W:tralokin umab 
Q4W:placebo) stratified by [CONTACT_421454]  16 (IGA 0/1 or I GA >1).  
Subjects randomised to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieve a clinical respons e 
at Week 16 ( IGA 0/1 or EASI75 ) will continue to receive placebo Q2W in the maintenance 
treatment period.

9.4 Background treatment  (emollients)  
All subjects must use an additive -free, basic bland emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) 
for at least 14 days before randomis ation . Subjects are not allowed to start treatment with 
prescription emollients or emollients containing additives such as ceramide, hyaluronic acid, 
urea, or filaggrin , unless initiated prior to the screening visit  (Section  9.6). Subjects must 
continue their background emollient treatment throughout the trial.  
9.[ADDRESS_531760]  receiv es from 3  months prior to screening  through 
safety follow -up (Week 66) must be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and the eCRF 
along with  details such as : 
Reason for use .
Dates of administration including start and stop dates .
Dosage information including dose and frequency .
For topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]: size of treated area ( ≤250 cm2 or >250 cm2).
Similarly, concomitant procedure s (including body location, diagnosis, and start and stop 
date) must also be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and the eCRF. Note: in this tria l, 
only surgical procedures will be recorded.  
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments to provide adequate 
supportive care as deemed necessary, except fo r medications listed in Section  9.6. The

Allergen immunotherapy
Live (attenuated) vaccine
The sponsor ’s medical expert  [INVESTIGATOR_73372] a subject receives any of these medications 
during the trial.  
9.7 Rescue treatment  
Initial treatment period and maintenance treatment period  
If medically necessary (i.e., to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD 
may be provided to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator. For the purpose of 
efficacy analysis, subj ects who receive rescue treatment during the initial treatment period  
will be considered as non -responders, but they will continue IMP treatment if rescue treatment  
consisted of topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910].  
TCI may be used for rescue, but should be reserved for p roblem areas only, for example face,  
neck, intertriginous and genital areas, etc. If possible, investigators should attempt to li mit the 
first step of rescue therapy to topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910], and escalate to systemic medications on ly 
for subjects who do not respond adequately after at least [ADDRESS_531761] receives rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal systemic 
immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate  mofetil, azathioprine, 
etc.),  IMP will be  immediately discontinued (see Section  9.8.2 , reasons for temporary 
discontinuation of IMP). After the treatment with these medications is completed, IMP may 
be resumed if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_86206] ’s medical exp ert, but not 
sooner than [ADDRESS_531762] efficacy and safety assessments ( for 
example disease severity scores, safety labs) immediately before administering  any rescue 
treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose , if necessary.  
Open -label tralokinumab arm only  
From Week 16 t hrough  safety follow -up (Week  66) subjects may use mild to moderate 
strength TCS  and/or TCI  as needed (prn usage) on lesi onal skin at the investigator ’s discretion  
(see 9 for TCS classification and examples) . Use of such TCS  and TCI should be recorded as 
concomitant medication .

9.8 Dose modification and IMP discontinuation rules  
9.8.1 Reasons for permanent discontinuation of IMP  
Subjects will be permanently discontinued from IMP in the event of:  
Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to IMP injection.
An AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335] ’s medical expert ,
contraindicates further dosing.
Diagnosis of a malignancy during the trial, excluding carcinoma in situ of the
cervix, or localised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
Evidence of pregnancy.
Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis and other
infections whose nature or course may suggest an immuno -compromised
status.
Severe laboratory abnormalities:
oALT and/or AST values >3x ULN with total bilirubin >2x  ULN

cases , sponsor ’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_73374].  
9.9 Treatment logistics and a ccountability 
9.9.1 Labelling and p ackaging of IMPs  
The IMP will be packaged in individually numbered kits , each contain ing 1 syringe  
(tralokinumab 150 mg or placebo ). 
Primary and secondary packaging materials  (syringe and outer carton, respectively)  will be 
individually labelled.  
The labelling of IMPs will be in accordance with Annex 13, local regulations and trial 
requirements.  Label text will be translated into local languages, as required. The inner label 
will be in English for k its used at trial sites.  
9.9.[ADDRESS_531764] be stored at 2 to 8 °C at the site. The temperature during storage must be 
monitored by a calibrated, stationary an d continuously monitoring  system. Minimum 
requirement is a calibrated min/max thermometer.  
A temperature log must be kept to document the storage within the right temperature interval. 
Storage facilities should be chec ked at least every working day.  
Stora ge of IMP may be delegated, e.g. to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601], as locally applicable.

Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the trial site .
Damaged kit upon receipt .
Damaged syringe/cartridge .
Damaged IMP should be documented via IWRS (refer to the IWRS manual for further 
details).  Damaged IMP should not be used.   
9.9.3 Drug accountability  
The investigator is fully responsible for the IMPs at the trial site and for maintaining adequate 
control of the IMPs and for documenting all transactions with them.  
An inventory ( trial medication inventory log) must be kept of the IMP administered to each 
subject randomised in the trial. The trial medication inventory log must be available for 
inspection during monitoring visits and will be checked by [CONTACT_421456].   
Full drug account ability  will also b e performed in the IWRS.  
Used syringes will be destroyed at the trial site provided the trial site has procedures in place 
for such IMP destruction . 
Trial sites which do not have such IMP destruction procedures in place will dispose used 
syringes in sharp s bins which will be shipped to the contract manufacturing organisation 
(CMO ). 
The trial site will maintain trial kit cartons from used kits until reconciliation.  The IMP will be 
fully accounted for by [CONTACT_421457]. Accountability will be 
documented on the trial medication inventory log and in the IWRS . Following reconciliation, 
the trial kit cartons from used kits may be discarded.   
All unused IMP supplied by [CONTACT_421458].  IMP 
may be returned from the trial site either to the CMO  directly or via the LEO Pharma  A/S 
affiliate or CRO responsible for the running of the clinical trial.  The IMP returned to the CMO 
will be reconciled with the individual drug accountability forms.  
For more information about IMP accountability, please refer to the IMP manual.

Where home -use is appropriate , the following apply : 
Subjects will only attend trial visits every 4 weeks, i.e., in weeks where
efficacy and safety assessments are scheduled (Section 9.2). At these trial
visits, subj ects will be provided with IMP to be administered at home at the
next dosing interval.
Subjects will be provided with sharps bins for used syringes.  Filled s harps bins
will be returned to the trial site.
Subjects will return trial kit cartons , and any unus ed IMP at each trial visit.
Unused IMP returned by [CONTACT_421459] -allocated IMP.
The trial medication inventory log will document all IMP handed out to and
returned b y each subject.

Unused IMP(s) as well as used syringes returned to the CMO will be destroyed by [CONTACT_421460]/or local requirements.    
9.9.[ADDRESS_531767] be recorded in the eCRF.  
Where home -use is appropriate , the following apply : 
Subjects will record date and injection site for each administration in a log of drug 
administration ; these data will then be transcribed into the eCRF by [CONTACT_421461]. If a subject is foun d to be non -compliant, the investigator shoul d remind the subject o f 
the importance of following the treatment instructions including taking the IMP as prescribed. 
Any non-compliance and the reason for it must be recorded in the eCRF.   
Where  tralokinumab is administered by [CONTACT_121573] ( Section  9.2), the site staff 
will record compliance data in the eCRF .

Page 65 of 156 
The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values 
indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition . The index will be calculated as 
shown in Panel 10. Briefly, t he investigator will assess the severity of 4  AD disease 
characteristics (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 
4 body regions (head/neck, trunk, upper extremities , lower extre mities ); severity will be 
assessed according to the scale shown in Panel 11. For each body region, a severity sum score 
will be calculated which will be multiplied by [CONTACT_73307] (Panel 11) and by a weigh ting 
factor . The EASI score equals the sum of the scores obtained for each body region ( Panel 10).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Scoring Atopic Dermatitis  
The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD  lesions,  along with 
subjective symptoms  (20). The maximum total s core is 103, with higher values indicating 
more severe disease. SCORAD will be assessed according to the SoP (Section  4). 
The assessment will be based on the condi tion of the disease at the time of evaluation and not 
in relation to the condition at a previous visit. Whenever possible, SCORAD should be 
assessed by [CONTACT_421467] -rater variability.  
The assessment consists of 3 components: A = extent , B = intensity , and C = subjective 
symptoms  
Extent (A)  
The extent  of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the 
sum of all areas (maximum score = 100%)  
Intensity (B)  
The intensity  of 6 specific symptoms of AD (erythema, edema/p apulation, oozing/crusting , 
excoriation, lichenification , and dryness) is assessed by [CONTACT_421468]:   
0 = None/absent  
1 = Mild 
2 = Moderate  
3 = Severe  
Note: dryness is evaluated on uninvolved areas.  
The sum of intensity score of the 6 symptoms  will be reported (maximum score = 18 ). 
Subjective symptoms (C)  
A subjective assessment of the average itch and sleeplessness over the last 3  days/nights is 
recorded for each symptom by [CONTACT_1175] a visual analogue scale , where 0 is no itch (or 
sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_531777] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum 
possible score of 20.  
The SCORAD is calculated  as: A/5+7B/2+C

[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure  
The Patient -Oriented E czema Measure ( POEM ) is a validated questionnaire used to assess 
disease symptoms in atopic eczema patients in both clinical practice and clinical trials ( 21). 
The tool consists of 7  items each addressing a specific symptom (itching, sleep, bleeding, 
weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cracking, flaking, and dryness ). Subject will score how often they have experienced 
each symptom over the previous week on a 5 -point categorical response scale ( 0 = ‘no days ’; 
1 = ‘1 to 2 days ’; 2 = ‘3 to 4 days’; 3 = ‘5 to 6’ days; 4 = ‘every day ’). The total score is the 
sum of the 7  items (range  0 to 28 ) and reflects disease -related morbidity; a high score is 
indicative of a worse disease severity . The POEM will be completed according to the SoP in 
Section  4. It will be completed electronically on the de vice supplied to the trial site and is 
included in the investigator trial file . 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Dermatology Life Quality Index

10.4 Safety assessments  
10.4.1  Vital signs 
Vital signs (resting blood pressure, pulse,  and body temperature) must be assessed according 
to the SoP ( Section  4). Vital signs will be measured in supi[INVESTIGATOR_421424] 
[ADDRESS_531782] 3 IMP dosing visits in both the initial treatment period (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4) 
and in op en-label treatment, subjects will be monitored after IMP administration for 
immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2  hours with vital signs taken every 30  minutes or 
until stable, whichever is later (Section  9.2).  
If an abnormal vital sign at screening is considered by [CONTACT_421472], it will be up to the investigator ’s discretion if the subject should be r andomis ed 
into the trial  (respecting exclusion criterion  no. 26).  
In case of abnormal findings , the vital sign measurement c an be repeated approximately 
[ADDRESS_531783] measurement verifies the second (normal) value, the  first measurement 
should be considered as false. If the third measurement confirms the first measurement

(abnormal) the second measurement will be considered as false. Only the last value measured 
and considered as correct will be recorded in the eCRF.   
Clinically significant a bnormal vital signs at the (first) screening visit will be documented as 
medical history in the eCRF  (refer to Appendix 4 D for furthe r details) . If an abnormal vital 
sign at any other visit than the first screening visit is considered by [CONTACT_99347], it will be reported as an AE in accordance with the principles for data 
entry ( Appendix 4 D). 
10.4.[ADDRESS_531784] including whole body inspection of the skin 
and auscultation of heart, lungs and abdomen; palpation of the abdominal organs and basic 
neurological status must be performed according to the So P (Section  4). 
If an unacceptable abnormal finding is identified  during the physical examination at the 
screening visit, the subject must not be randomi sed into the clinical trial (respecting exclusion 
criterion  no. 26). 
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_531785] 5 minutes at the visits indicated in the SoP ( Section  4). 
A pre -evaluation of the ECGs will be performed by [CONTACT_421473]. At a minimum , date of ECG collection will be recorded in the source 
documents.  
The ECG data will be transferred to a central ECG service company for central evaluation. A 
cardiologist at the ECG service company will analyse and interpret the ECG data. The ECG 
service company will provide ECG evaluation reports to the trial sites.  
The investigator must evaluate all abnormal ECG results (‘clinically significant ’ or ‘not 
clinically significant ’) and sign and date. The investigator has the final decis ion on the clinical 
significance of ECG abnormalities. If a result is abnormal at the screening visit and 
considered by [CONTACT_11150], it will be up to the investigator ’s 
discretion if the subject should be enrolled into the  trial (respecting exclusion criterion

10.5 Other assessments  
10.5.1  Photography  (selected trial sites)  
At selected trial sites, subjects will be asked to participa te in a photography component 
involving digital photography assessments to show disease progression over time.  
Participation in this photography component requires that the subject provides additional 
informed consent.  
Digital colour photographs will be ta ken of the disease area and a representative lesion 
according to the SoP ( Section  4). 
The trial sites will use their own equipment to take the photographs. Instruc tions for 
photography will be provided to the sites in a photography manual. Photography standards 
and procedures are provided to the trial sites by [CONTACT_6201].  
The photographs will have no other subject identifier than the subject ID and will be 
transmitted electronically to the photography vendor using a secure  file transfer protocol . 
Printed copi[INVESTIGATOR_421425].  
LEO may at its discretion use the photograph s in publications, posters and similar types of 
information material or media targeting patients and HCPs . The photographs can also be part 
of training material used for training and educational purposes. Steps will be taken to ensure  
that the identity of the subject is protected to the extent possible.  
10.6 Estimate of t otal blood volume  collected  
Blood samples will be drawn for safety ( chemistry, haematology, serology , PK, and ADA ). 
The total volume of blood to be withdrawn is approximately  285 mL which is les s than the 
volume of blood drawn during a blood donation (approximately 500 mL).

11Adverse e vents  
AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined in  Appendix [ADDRESS_531790] has signed  the 
informed c onsen t form until completion of the clinical trial ( defined as the safety 
follow -up visit [ADDRESS_531791] injection ). For subjects enter ing the long -term extension 
trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND), any (S)AE with onset before the final visit in the 
LP0162 -1326 trial should be reported in the parent trial. If ongoing, the (S)AE will also be  
recorded as medical history in ECZTEND.   
AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_82048].  
At all visits, the subject will be asked a non -leading question by [CONTACT_73318], 
for example : “How have you felt since I saw you last?” No specific symptoms should  be 
asked for. It is imp ortant that the investigator  also observes the subject for any changes no t 
reported by [CONTACT_73319].  
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_531792] be recorded on the AE form 
of the CRF and should be described in the following manner:  
The AE term  must  be in precise English medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact 
words used by [CONTACT_423]). Whenever possible, a specific diagnosis should be stated ( for 
example  ‘allergic contact [CONTACT_8748] ’).  
The duration  of the AE must  be reported by [CONTACT_421475]. In 
addition, it  must  be recorded whether the AE started prior to start of IMP. 
AEs must be classified in terms of severity, causality and outcome according to the definitions 
in Appendix 3 . 
Action taken with trial treatment:  Any action taken with IMP as a consequence of the AE 
must  be recorded (dose not changed, dose reduced, dose increased, drug interrupted, drug 
withdrawn, not applicable, unknown).

four categories: wrong medication, wrong dose (including strength, form, concentration, 
amount), wr ong route of administration , or wrong subject . 
The medication error must be documented on the AE form in the eCRF. In addition , AEs 
originating from a medication error must be documented on a separate line specifying the 
category of error (see definitions above).  
If the medication error is due to device malfunction, such malfunction must be reported as a 
device complaint as described in Section  9.11.

11.5.6  Aggravation of condition  
Any clinically significant aggravation/exacerbation/worsening of any medical condition(s), 
compared to screening , must be reported as an AE.  
11.6 Follow -up for final outcome of adverse events  
During the trial , the investigator should follow up for final outcome on all AEs (including 
SAEs). Once a subject leaves the clinical trial, the investigator should follow up on the 
outcome of all non -serious AEs classified as of possible/probable relationship to the IMP for 
[ADDRESS_531803] stabilised and cannot be expected to 
recover during study or safety follow -up periods, for example chronic illnesses, the final 
outcome should  be considered recovered and a sta tement that the SAE has stabilised should 
be added to the narrative in the SAE form.   
11.7 Handling of an urgent safety measure  
An urgent safety measure is a measure taken to implement an action/protocol deviation under 
an emergency. This is defined within the EU Directive as “…the occurrence of any new event 
relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal pr oduct 
where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the 
investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any 
immediate hazard. ” (32). 
If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in th e 
clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clini cal trial 
subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so 
without prior approval from LEO, regulatory authority(ies) , or IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
The investigator must immediately inform LEO - by [CONTACT_421479] - of this change in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary halt 
providing full details of the information and the decision making process leading to the 
implementation of the urgent safety measure.  
LEO must act immediately upon receipt  of the urgent safety measure notification in 
accordance with internal procedures  and local legislation .

12  Statistical m ethods  
12.1 Sample size 
A total of 780 subjects will be randomised 3:1 to initial treatment in this tri al (585 subjects in 
the tralokinumab arm; 195 subjects in the placebo arm). The sample size is chosen to ensure 
that sufficient safety information is collected and to ensure a sufficient number of responders 
are re-randomised to maintenance treatment.   
The primary endpoints for initial treatment IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week 16 are to be 
evaluated hiera rchically testing both hypotheses of no difference between active and placebo 
at the 5% significance level. The hypothesis for IGA 0/[ADDRESS_531804]; if  significant, the 
EASI75 hypothesis will be tested.  
For the endpoint IGA 0/1 at Week 16 , a sample size of 780 subjects randomised at 3:1 will 
provide >99% power to detect a difference between the 2 arms of 30% for tralokinumab and 
10% for placebo at a 5% 2 -sided level of significance. For the endpoint EASI75 at Week 16 a 
sample size of 780 will likewise provide >99% power to detect a difference between 
tralokinumab and placebo at Week 16, assuming EASI75 response rates of 40% and 15%, 
respectively.  
With an IGA response rate of 30% at Week 16, 175 IGA responders initially treated with 
tralokinumab are expected to enter the maintenance treatment period (70 subjects on 
tralokinumab Q2W, 70 subjects on tralokinumab Q4W, 35 subjects on placebo). Assuming 
IGA resp onse rates at Week 52 of 80%, 50% and 5%, respectively for Q2W, Q4W , and 
placebo, the power to show a difference at the 4% significance level will be >99% between 
Q2W and placebo and >99% between Q4W and placebo.  
With an EASI75 response rate of 40% at Week  16, 235 EASI75 responders initially treated 
with tralokinumab are expected to enter the maintenance treatment period (94 subjects on 
tralokinumab Q2W, 94 subjects on tralokinumab Q4W, 47 subjects on placebo). Assuming 
EASI75 response rates at Week 52 of 9 0%, 55% and 5%, respectively for Q2W, Q4W , and 
placebo, the power to show a difference at the 4% significance level will be >99% between 
Q2W and placebo  and >99% between Q4W and placebo.  
12.2 Trial analysis sets 
All screened subjects will be accounted for in th e CTR . 
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP01 62-1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.[ADDRESS_531805] from the full analysis set, a justification addressing ICH E9 w ill 
be given.  
A per protocol analysis set  will be used as an efficacy subset for the analysis of the primary  
endpoints up to Week  16, and analyses based on the per protocol analysis set will be 
performed to support the results obtained for the full analysis set. The per protocol analys is 
set will be defined by [CONTACT_421480] :  
Receive no treatment with  the IMP.
Provide no assessment of IGA or EASI  following start of treatment .
Are known to have taken the wrong IMP throughout the initial treatment
period of the trial .
Do not fulfil all the inclusion criteria no. 3, 6, 7 and 8.
A maintenance analysis set will be defined as all subjects who receive tralokinumab in the 
initial treatment period and who are re -randomised to maintenance treatment.  
A safety analysis set will be defined by [CONTACT_421481]/or for whom no post -baseline safety data are 
available.  
A maintenance safety analysis set will be defined as subjects in the full analysis set who a re 
re-randomised to maintenance treatment  at Week  [ADDRESS_531806] safety data available after Week 16 and who at any poi nt 
in time enter the open -label treatment arm.  
Based on the above -mentioned rules, the inclusion/exclusion of su bjects from the trial 
analysis sets will be documented in the statistical analysis plan u pdate before breaking the 
randomisation code.

by [CONTACT_421482] (IGA 3 or 4) . 
Demographics include age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Other baseline characteristics include vit al 
signs  (including height, weight , body mass index ), duration of AD, concurrent diagnoses 
(from medical history and indications for concomitant medication), concomitant medication, 
and previous AD treatments .  
12.3.3  Exposure and treatment compliance  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exposure  
Exposure to treatment will be presented for the safety analysis  set (initial treatment) , the 
maintenance safety analysis set (maintenance treatment ), and open -label safety analysis set 
(open -label treatment)  as days of exposure  per treatment group.  
For the full trial period , the days o f exposure on tralokinumab irrespective of treatment gr oup 
will be summarised - subtracting potential periods on placebo - for the safety analysis set.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment compliance 
Adherence to treatment regime n will be recorded in the eCRF. Where home-use is 
appropriate, the subject will be asked at each trial visit if IMP was administered as instru cted. 
The log of drug administration may be used as source. If any complications or deviations in 
administration are observed, these will be described as protocol deviations. 
Adherence will be presented for the safety analysis set (initial treatment) and for the 
maintenance safety analysis set (maintenance treatment) for each treatment group. Adherence 
will also be presented for the open-label safety analysis set (open-label treatment). 
12.3.4  Multiple testing procedure 
To control the overall type 1 error rate, the primary analyses of the primary estimands for the primary and secondary endpoints for the initial and maintenance treatment will follow the testing procedure outlined in Panel 14. The hypothesis relating to a specific endpoint cannot 
be rejected unless all hypotheses relating to endpoints earlier in the hierarchy are also rejected.

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 86 of 156 
The procedure will be as follows:  
IGA 0/1 at Week 16 between tralokinumab and placebo is evaluated at a 5% significance 
level. If the test is significant, EASI75 at Week 16 between tralokinumab and placebo is 
evaluate d at a 5% significance level.  
If both these tests are significant, the significance level (alpha) will be split between th e 
analyses of the 3  secondary endpoints at Week  16 and the analyses of the 2  maintenance 
endpoints at Week  52. These groups of tests are tested in parallel with alpha=1% for the 
endpoints at Week  16 and with alpha=4% for the maintenance endpoints at Week 52.  
The evaluations of the 3  secondary endpoints at Week 16 between tralokinumab and placebo 
will use the Holm method ( 25) for 3 ordered p -values at a 1% significance level to adjust for 
multiplicity.  
The hypotheses for the maintenance treatment endpoints will be tested sequentially in the 
specif ied order at the 4% significance level. The next hypothesis will only be tested if the  
former was significant.  
If all p -values for the 3 secondary endpoints at Week  16 are significant, then the hypotheses 
for the maintenance treatment endpoints can be eva luated at a 5% significance level . 
Conversely, if all p -values for the maintenance endpoints are significant, then the hypothes es 
for the 3 secondary endpoints at Week  16 can be evaluated at a 5% significance level.   
12.3.5  Analysis of initial treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of primary endpoint s 
Three estimands addressing different aspects of the trial objectives will be defined:  
Primary estimand: ‘composite ’.
Secondary estimand: ‘hypothetical ’.
Tertiary estimand: ‘treatment policy ’.
The applied estimands incorporate two main types of events that influence how the treatment 
effects are estimated:  
Initiation of rescue medication : Some of the estimands use the initiation of
rescue medication as an event that modifies the applied value of an endpoint,
e.g. by [CONTACT_331860] a subject receiving rescue medication as a non -responder.

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 5.0 
Page 87 of 156 
Permanent discontinuation of IMP : This event occurs when a subject is
permanently withdrawn from the treatment or the trial as described in
Section  8.5. This can either happen at his/her own initiative or at the
investigator ’s discretion. The event also includes the possibility of a subject
being lost to follow -up. The timing of the event is defined as the date of the
early termination visit for withdrawn subjects or – in the case of a subject lost
to follow -up – the date of the last known visit to the clinic. As for the rescue
medication, the event type is used to modify an applied endpoint value.
All analyses will be based on the full analysis set unless otherwise specified.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Primary estimand: ‘composite ’ 
The primary estimand for the primary endpoints will be:  
Treatment difference in response rates of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks
achieved without rescue medication,  regardless of treatment discontinuation.
The primary estimand assesses the expected difference in response rates (defined as response  
obtained without initiation of any rescue medication) after [ADDRESS_531808] 
received rescue medication will be considered non -responders, reflecting an assumption that 
initiation of rescue medication indicates failure of the randomised treatment to achieve 
response, and that a (possible) observed positive resp onse after initiation of rescue medica tion 
is not attributable to the randomised treatment. Missing data for subjects who d id not attend  
the Week  [ADDRESS_531809] stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (North America, Europe , Australia, and 
Korea ) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4). The treatment estimate and the 
corresponding 95%  CI will be presented. The null hypothesis of no difference in response 
rates between tralokinumab and placebo will be tested against the 2 -sided alternative that 
there is a difference.

The primary endpoints will be tested sequentially at a 5% significance level. IGA 0/[ADDRESS_531810] to the retrieved data at Week  16 and assumptions regarding missing Week  16 data.  
Sensitivity analysis 1 : All subjects who have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week  [ADDRESS_531811] discontinued treatment .  
Sensitivity analysis 2 : Rather than imputing all subjects who do not attend the Week  [ADDRESS_531812] (LOCF), hereby [CONTACT_421483] a more reliable 
estimate of the missing response (than a non -respon se). 
Supplementary analysis  
The primary analysis of the primary estimand is repeated based on the per protocol analysis 
set. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Secondary estimand: ‘hypothetical ’ 
The secondary estimand for the primary endpoints will be:  
Treatment difference in response rates  of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16  weeks
if all subjects adhered to the treatment regimen in the sense that they did not
discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue medication was made available
before Week  16.
The secondary estimand assesses the expected diffe rence in response rates achieved when 
adhering to the treatment regimen tralokinumab with no rescue medication as compared to a 
treatment regimen with placebo with no rescue medication.

IGA 0/1 responder imputation  
Imputation of missing binary IGA 0/1 data at Week 16 will be done using multiple 
imputations of the underlying 5 -point IGA values within the 2 groups defined according to 
randomised treatment arm assuming that data is missing at random within each arm.  
1.In each group, intermittent missing values will be imputed using LOCF to obtain a
monotone missing data pattern.
2.An ordina l logistic regression model assuming proportional odds will be fitted to the IGA
value at Week  2. The model will include effects of region, and baseline disease severity
(IGA  3 or 4) as factors. The estimated parameters, and their variances, will be used t o

regression model with effects of region and baseline disease severity (IGA  3 or 4) togeth er
with the IGA value at Week  2 as factors. The estimated parameters, and their variances,
will be used to impute missing values at Week  4.
4.This stepwise procedure will then be repeated sequentially for Week  6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and
16 with the modification that only the IGA values from the two preceding visits will be
included as factors in addition to region and baseline disease severity. The missin g binar y
IGA 0/1 response at Week  16 will be derived from the corresponding underlying imputed
IGA value.
EASI75 responder imputation  
Imputation of missing binary EASI75 data at Week  16 will be done using multiple 
imputations of the underlying 72 -point EAS I values within the two groups defined according 
to randomised treatment arm assuming that data is missing at random within each arm.  
1.Intermittent missing values will be imputed in each group using a Markov Chain Monte

2.An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model is fitted to the EASI value at Week  2. The
model will include effects of baseline EASI as a covariate, and region, and baseline

will be used to impute missing EASI values at Week  2. 100  copi[INVESTIGATOR_421427] (seed= 1110992 6).
3.For each of the [ADDRESS_531814] as for Week  2. The imputations will be based on the same ANCOV A
model with effects of baseline EASI as a covariate, and region, and baseline disease
severity (IGA  3 or 4) as factors together with the EASI va lue at Week  2 as covariate. The
estimated parameters, and their variances, will be used to impute missing values at
Week  4.
4.This stepwise procedure will then be repeated sequentially for Week  6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and
16 with the modification that only the EAS I values from the preceding two visits will be
included as covariates in addition to baseline EASI as a covariate, and region and baseli ne
disease severity as factors. The missing binary EASI75 response at Week  16 will be
derived from the corresponding und erlying imputed EASI value.
Analysis of Week 16 response  
For each of the 100  complete data sets, the difference in response rates (either the IGA  0/1 or 
the EASI75) between treatment groups will be analysed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test stratified  by [CONTACT_11338] (North America, Europe , Australia, and Korea ) and baseline disease  
severity (IGA  3 or 4). The estimates and standard errors from the [ADDRESS_531815] error using Rubin ’s rule to dra w 
inference. From these pooled estimates, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will be 
calculated.  
Sensitivity analysis for the secondary estimand  
Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random within each treatment arm, it i s 
assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue IMP permanently/receive rescue 
medication in the tralokinumab arm will resemble missing data from subjects from the 
placebo arm who do not discontinue IMP permanently/receive rescue medication. The 
underlying assumption is that the effect of tralokinumab following rescue medication or 
permanent treatment discontinuation is similar to the effect of placebo. It should be notice d 
that this assumption is pronouncedly conservative in favour of placebo as it tends to minimis e 
the differences between arms.

Imputation of missing data at Week  16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where 
missing data in the tralokinumab arm as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from 
observed data in the placebo arm (u sing a so -called copy -reference approach). With this 
exemption, the stepwise multiple imputation procedure and subsequent analysis will be 
conducted in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Tertiary estimand: ‘treatm ent policy ’ 
The tertiary estimand for the primary endpoints will be:  
Treatment difference  in response rate after [ADDRESS_531816] as specifi ed for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand.  
For discontinued subjects, it is expected that the number of subje cts with retrieved data at  
Week  16 will be too small to facilitate the same imputation model as mentioned above. 
Consequently, an imput ation model with only region and baseline effects (IGA as a factor and  
EASI as a covariate [only for EASI75]) will be applied for discontinued subjects. Some 
factors may have to be omitted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects o nly 
come from one region or if they all have the same baseline severity.  
The imputed datasets will be analysed in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of 
the secondary estimand.

Sensitivity analyses for the tertiary estimand  
Rather than imputing We ek 16 data as described in the primary analysis of the tertiary 
estimand, missing observations will be imputed as ‘non-responders ’. The assumption reflects 
that discontinued subjects  without retrieved data at Week  16 are more likely to be 
non-responders th an resembling discontinued subje cts with retrieved data at Week  16. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The [ADDRESS_531817] of 16 weeks of treatment on (i) severity and 
extent of AD, (ii) itch, and (iii) HRQoL. The corresponding endpo ints are (i) the change from 
baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD, (ii) reduction (Y/N) of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS average 
score for the past week (hereinafter ‘Worst Daily Pruritus NRS weekly average ’) of at least 4 
from baseline to Week 16, and (iii) change fr om baseline to Week [ADDRESS_531818] week prior to baseline will be used to calculate 
the baseline itch (see also inclusion criterion no. 9).  
Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS weekly average of at least [ADDRESS_531819] Daily 
Pruritus NRS weekly average replaces EASI where preceding values are used as covariates.  
The change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD and DLQI, respectively, are continuous 
endpoints and will be analysed as described below.  
All analyses will be based on the full analysis set unless otherwise specified.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Primary estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints: 
‘hypothetical ’ 
The primary estimand for the continuous secondary endpo ints will be:  
Treatment difference in change from baseline to Week  16 in SCORAD and
DLQI, respectively, if all subjects adhered to the treatment regimen in the
sense that they did not discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue medication
was made available before Week  16.
The primary estimand assesses the expected benefit when adhering to the treatment regimen 
tralokinumab with no rescue medication as compared to a treatment regimen with placebo 
with no rescue medication.

Primary analysis of the primary esti mand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Data collected after permanent discontinuation of IMP or after initiation of rescue medicati on 
will not be included in the analysis.  
The endpoints will be analysed using a repeated measurements model on the post basel ine 
responses up to Week  [ADDRESS_531820] -Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator degrees of freedom, and the mean modelled as 
follows (shown for change from baseline in SCORAD):  
Change from baseline in SCORAD  
= treat ment × visit + baseline SCORAD × visit + region + baseline IGA  
This model assumes that data is missing at random within each treatment arm. The estimates 
will be presented with nominal p -values and 95% CI at each visit. The primary comparison 
between tralo kinumab and placebo will be at Week  16. 
Sensitivity analysis for the primary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random within each treatment arm it is  
assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue treatment/receive rescue medication 
in the tralokinumab arm will resemble data from subjects from the placebo arm who do not 
discontinue treatment/receive rescue medication. Imputation of missing data at Week  16 will 
be done using a pattern mix ture model where missing data in the tralokinumab arm as well as 
the placebo arm will be imputed from the placebo arm (using a so -called copy -reference 
approach). The procedure for the change from baseline in SCORAD at Week  16 is described 
below. The same procedure will be applied for the DLQI endpoint.  
1.Intermittent missing values will be imputed in each group using a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method to obtain a monotone missing data pattern and 100  copi[INVESTIGATOR_421426] (seed=29099726).
2.For each of the 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_136691], an ANCOV A model will be fitted to the
SCORAD value at Week  2 in the placebo group. The model will include effects of
baseline SCORAD as a covariate, and region and baseline disease severity (IGA  3 or 4) as
factors. The estimated parameters, and their variances, will be used to impute missing
values at Week  2 for the placebo group as well as the tralokinumab group
(seed=11109926).

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.[ADDRESS_531821] as for Week  2. The imputations will be based on a similar ANCOV A model, but
with SCORAD value at Week  2 included as an additional covariate. The parameters from
the model will be estimated based on data from the placebo group. The estimated
parameters, and their variances, will be used to impute missing values at Week  4 for both
treatment groups.
4.This stepwise procedure will then be repeated sequentially for Week  6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and
16 with the SCORAD values from the preceding two visits inclu ded as covariates in
addition to baseline SCORAD as a covariate, and region and baseline disease severity as
factors.
For each of the 100 imputed dataset, the change from baseline in SCORAD at Week  16 will 
be analysed using an ANCOV A model with effects of treatment, region,  baseline disease 
severity (IGA  3 or 4), and baseline SCORAD value. The estimat ed difference at Week  [ADDRESS_531822] error using Rubin ’s rule  
to draw inference. From these pooled e stimates, the 95%  CI for the treatment difference will  
be calculated.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Secondary estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints: 
‘treatment policy ’ 
The seconda ry estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints will be:  
Treatment differences in change from baseline to Week  16 in SCORAD and
DLQI, respectively, between tralokinumab and placebo regardless of rescue
medication use and treatment discontinuation.
The s econdary estimand assesses the average difference in change from baseline in SCORAD 
and DLQI after 16 weeks, resulting from initiation of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab 
and additional rescue medication as compared to a treatment regimen with placebo  and 
additional rescue medication.  
Primary analyses for the secondary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Data retrieved at Week  [ADDRESS_531823] permanently discontinued IMP prior to 
Week  16 will be included in the analysis. Missing Week  16 data will be imputed using 
multiple imputations assuming that data is missing at random within the groups used for 
imputation.

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.[ADDRESS_531824] above. 
Consequently, an imputation model with only region and baseline effects (IGA as a factor and  
baseline SCORAD / DLQI as a covariate) will be applied for discontinued subjects. Some 
factors may have to be omitted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects on ly

Sensitivity analyses for the secondary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random, it is assumed that missing dat a 
from subjects in the tralokinumab arm who have/have not discontinued treatment prior to 
Week  [ADDRESS_531826]/have not 
discontinued treatment prior to Week  16.  
Imputation of missing data at Week  16 will be don e using a pattern mixture model where 
missing data in the tralokinumab arm as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from the

Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS (weekly average) of at least 4 from
baseline to each week through Week  1 to 15.
Change in DLQI score from baseline to each scheduled assessment until

Nominal p -values for test of a treatment difference and 95%  CI for the difference will be 
presented at each scheduled visit (or each week for Worst Daily Pruritus NRS) using the same  
approach as applied for the primary analysis of the relevant en dpoint in the primary estiman d. 
For the binary endpoints, the same Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test as for the Week  16 
assessment will be applied. For the continuous endpoints, the repeated measurements model 
already described previously for the Week  16 assess ments facilitates that the p -values, 
treatment differences and 95% CIs can be derived for each visit up to Week  14 (or Week  [ADDRESS_531832] Daily Pruritus NRS) in the same analysis that already will be made 
for the corresponding Week  16 assessme nts. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Patient -reported outcomes 
The PROs  POEM, DLQI, EQ-5D-5L, SF -36, WPAI -GH, HADS, and TSQM will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_72082]. The summaries will be 
made separate ly for the initial treatment and the maintenance treatment. Data from the initial  
treatment period will be presented for the full analysis set and data from the maintenance 
treatment period will be presented for the maintenance analysis set.  
The PROs collected in the eDiaries on a daily basis (Worst Dai ly Pruritus NRS, Average Daily 
Pruritus NRS, Eczema-related Sleep NRS, PGI-B, and PGI -S) will all be summarised over 
time by [CONTACT_2070]. The summaries will be separate for the  
initial treatment and the maintenance treatmen t. Data from the initial treatment period will  be 
presented for the full analysis set and data from the maintenance treatment period will be 
presented for the maintenance analysis set.  
The Average Daily Pruritus NRS collected over the last week prior to baseline will be used to  
calculate the baseline average daily itch. A minimum of [ADDRESS_531833]  3 from baseline to Week  2 will be summarised  by [CONTACT_421484].

value.  
The treatment satisfaction (TSQM) at Week 16 will be summarised by [CONTACT_421485], region and baseline IGA as factors.  
For the PGI-B, a day of ‘no or slight bother ’ is def ined as answering the question with ‘not at  
all’ or ’slightly ’. The s ubjects ’ number of days of ‘no or slight bother ’ will be tabulated per 
treatment group for the initial  treatme nt period . The mean  number of days  will be presented 
with 95% CIs and compared between the 2 treatment groups  using an analysis of variance 
model including treatment, region, and baseline IGA as factors . In this analysis, data collec ted 
after permanent dis continuation of IMP or after initiation of rescue medication will be 
disregarded.  
12.3.6  Analysis of maintenance treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of maintenance endpoints  
For the two dichotomous maintenance endpoin ts, IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week  52, an 
adapted version of the primary estimand for the primary endpoints will be considered:  
Treatment difference in response rates  of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 52  weeks
achieved without rescue medicati on and without transfer to open -label
treatment
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 99 of 156 
The adapted estimand takes into accou nt that throughout the maintenance period subjects will 
be actively discontinued from t he treatment randomised at Week  16 and transferred to the 
open -label tralokinumab arm if they meet the prespecified treatment failure criteria described 
in Section 7.1. 
This estimand assesses the expected difference in response rates (defined as response obtain ed 
without initiation of any rescue medicati on and without transfer to  open -label trea tment) aft er 
52 weeks in patients res ponding to tralokinumab at Week  16 (as measured by a positive 
IGA 0/1 or EASI75 response), resulting from a maintenance treatment regimen with 
tralokinumab Q2W or tralokinumab Q4W compared to a treatment  regimen with placebo.  
Primary analysis for the maintenance estimand  
All subjects who prior to the Week  [ADDRESS_531835] received rescue medication, including TCS, 
and/or been transferred to the open -label tralokin umab arm will be considered 
non-responders.  
This reflects an assumption that initiation of rescue  medication or transfer to open -label 
treatm ent indicates failure of the re -random ised treatment assigned at Week  16, and that a 
(possible) observed positive response thereafter is not attributable to th e treatment rec eived 
from Week  16. In addition, all subjects wit h missing endpoint data at Week  [ADDRESS_531836] for maintenance treatment will be tested sequentially 
with the next hypothesis in the sequence only being tested if the previous one was significant. 
The multiple testing procedure planned to control the overall type  1 error rate for the trial is 
described in detail in Section  12.3.4 . The maintenance endpoints will be evaluated in the 
following order:  
No difference between Q2W and placebo for IGA 0/1 at Week 52.
No difference between Q2W and placebo for EASI75 at Week 52 .
No difference between Q4W and placebo for IGA 0/1 at Week 52 .
No difference between Q4W and placebo for EASI75 at Week 52 .
For the IGA 0/1 endpoint, the analysis will be based on the subjects in the maintenance 
analysis set who obtained an IGA of 0/1 at Week 16  without rescue medication . For the 
EASI75 endpoint , the analysis will be based on the subjects in the maintenance analysis set 
who obtained an EASI75 at Week 16  without rescue medication .

Page 100 of 156 
For each endpoint (IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week  52) the estim ated response rates and 
corresponding 95% CIs, and the pairwise treatment differences will be presented. The 
difference in response rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  test stratified by [CONTACT_11338]. The null hypoth eses of no difference in 
response rates will be tested against the two -sided alternative that there is a difference.  
Sensitivity analysis for the maintenance estimand  
In a sensitivity analysis, data missing at Week 52 for subjects who did not receive resc ue 
medication, did not transfer to open -label and did not withdraw from the trial due to AE or 
lack of efficacy will be imputed using LOCF.  
Pooled analyses across both LP0162 -1325 and LP0162 -1326  
In order to achieve more precise estimates of clinical respo nse within treatment groups in the 
maintenance period, analyses of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week  52 will be performed on 
pooled data from the 2  trials LP0162 -1325 and LP0162 -1326. For each endpoint (IGA  0/1 
and EASI75 at Week  52) the estimated response rates and corresponding 95%  CIs and the 
pairwise treatment differences will be presented. The difference in response rates between 
treatment groups wil l be analysed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_421486].  The pooled analyses wil l only be presented in marketing authorisation 
applications.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of ot her maintenance endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Time to relapse  
The following 2  types of relapse will be considered and analysed: 
Relapse according to IGA: f irst assessment of an IGA ≥2 or initiation of rescue
medication after initiation of maintenance treatment among subjects in the
maintenance analysis set who obtained an IGA  0/1 at Week  16 without rescue
medication .
Relapse according to EASI75: f irst time of not achieving EASI 75 or ini tiation of
rescue medication after initiation of maintenance treatment  among subjects in the
maintenance analysis set who obtained an EASI75 at Week  16 without rescue
medication .
Kaplan -Meier curves of time to relapse will be estimated and presented by [CONTACT_421487]. In a supplementary exploratory analysis, tralokinumab Q2W vs.

The number of responders according to IGA 0/1 at Week 52 will be tabulated for the subgroup 
of subjects in the maintenance analysis set who are re -randomised meeting the EASI75 
criterion but not the IGA 0/1 criterion at Week 16.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Supportive maintenance  
To support the maintenance objective, the response IGA 0/1 or EASI75 at Week  52 will be 
presented and analysed as described above for the pr imary analysis of the maintenance 
estimand for subjects in the maintenance analysis set  who did not receive rescue medication 
prior to Week  16.  
12.3.7  Analysis of safety  
The analys es of safety will be based on the safety analysis set s. The reporting of safety da ta 
will be presented separately for the initial treatment , the maintenance treatment , and the 
open -label treatment .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse events  
AEs will be coded during the course of the trial according to  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_121606]  (SOC) . 
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarised, however , all AEs recorded during the course of 
the trial will be included in the subject data listings. An event will be considered 
treatm ent-emergent if started after the first use of IMP or if started before the first use of IMP 
(applicable if subject had a wash -out) and worsened in severity thereafter. The tabulations 
described in the following will only include the treatment -emergent events. In each of the 
tabulations, AEs will be defined by [CONTACT_421488] . 
An overall summary of the number of treatment -emergent AEs, number (percentage) of 
subjects with any treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, deaths, premature disconti nuations from the

The severity for each type of AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  
The causal relationship to IMP for each type of AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Related AEs are defined as AEs for which the investigator has not described the causal 
relationship to IMP as ‘not related ’. The number of related AEs and the number of subjects 
experiencing each type of related AE will be tabulated. The percentage of subjects with 
related AEs in the initial treatment period  will be compared between treatment groups by a

SAE s and AESIs will be evaluated separately . A narrative for each SAE will be given.  AESIs 
and AEs leading to withdrawal from trial will be tabulated and listed.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital signs 
The change in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) from baseline to each 
visit will be summarised by [CONTACT_421489], standard deviation, median,

open -label safety analysis set . 
Laboratory parameters will be classified as ‘low’, ‘normal ’ or ‘high’, depending on whether 
the value is below, within or above the reference range, respectively. A shift table will be 
produced showing the categories at baseline against those  at end of treatment . Subjects with 
laboratory parameters outside the reference range will be listed.

population -based meta -analysis. Results of the meta -analysis will be presented in a separate 
pharmacometrics report outside of the CTR . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti-drug antibodies 
ADA status (positive versus  negative) at each visit will be summari sed by [CONTACT_421492] , maintenance and open -label treatment. If considered relevant, d escriptive statistics 
including number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, and range of the actual ADA 
titres by [CONTACT_421493]. The ADA status across the  trial for each 
subject (positive versus  negative) will  also be classified and summaris ed by [CONTACT_1570].  
The association of ADA status across the trial (positive vs. negative) with AEs/SAEs may be 
evaluated. In addition, t he association of ADA tit res (≥ media n titre in positive subjects versus  
< median tit re) with AE/SAEs may be evaluated for ADA -positive treated subjects only. The 
ADA -positive subjects across the trial may also be divided into persistent positive versus 
transient positive. A subject will be considered as persistent positive if he/she has positive 
ADA for at least [ADDRESS_531839] will be 
considered as transient ADA positive. The associations between ADA and AE/SAEs may be 
summarised for both persistent positive subjects versus transient positives subjects.  
For subjects who develop ADA , the IGA score and change in EASI at end of treatment will be 
listed.  
Evaluations of nAB  will be conducted on those serum samples that test positive for A DA. The 
test sample is deemed positive or negative for the presence of nAb to tralokinumab relative to 
a pre -determined (in assay validation), st atistically derived cut point.  
For ADA, all subjects with tit re information will be listed .

12.3.10  General principles  
Unless otherwise stated, a ll significance tests will be two -sided using the 5% significance  
level . All CIs will be presented with 95% degree of confidence.  
An observed -cases approach will be used for tabulations of data by [CONTACT_765] (i.e. involving only 
those subjects who attended each specific visit).  
Categorical data will be summarised using the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category and treatment grou p. Continuous data will be summarised using the mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum values.  
All the analyses specified in the protocol will be reviewed in relation to the blinded data 
actually obtained and the statistical analysis plan u pdate will be finalised before breaking the 
randomisation code.  
Any changes from the statistical analysis planned in this clinical trial protocol will be 
described and ju stified in a protocol amendment , the statistical a nalysis plan u pdate  and/or in 
the CTR  dependent on the type of deviation.  
12.3.11  Handling of missing values  
Procedures for handling of missing values are included under the sections describing the 
individual analyses.

Appendix 2 : Definitions of adverse events and serious adverse events  
Adverse event definition  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and u nintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidel ine for Good Clinical Practice, 
E6 (R1)).  
This definition includes:  
accidental injuries, events related to trial procedures, reasons for any
unfavourable and unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose),
clinically significant worsening of pre -existin g conditions, or reasons for
admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421430]. It also includes AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based
on the pharmacological effect of the IMP. In addition, any laboratory
abnormality assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_421496].
Serious a dverse event definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that  
results in death .
is life -threatening .
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574].
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421431] ’s medical
record.
results in persistent or significant disability/in capacity .
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .

is a medically important condition. Events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421432] t he other outcomes listed in the
definition above. Examples are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at
home for allergic bronc hospasm , blood dyscrasias and convulsions that do not
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Page 116 of 156 
Appendix 3 : Classification of adverse events  
Severity  
The severity  of the AE should  be described in terms of mild, moderate or severe according to 
the investigator ’s clinical judgement.  
Mild  An AE that is usua lly transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate  An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. Th e event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to 
the subject.  
Severe  An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded.  
Causality  
The causal relation  of the AE to the use of the IMP should  be described in terms of probable, 
possible or not related according to the following:  
Probably 
related  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. 
Could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73258] . 
Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. 
Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the IMP. 
Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge . 
Possibly 
relate d Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the 
IMP. 
Could also be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_73258] .

Processing of personal data 
This protocol specifies the personal data on trial subjects ( for example age, gender, health 
condition, height, medical history, test results, etc.) which shall be collected as part of the 
clinica l trial and processed during and after trial completion.  
Personal data collected as part of the clinical trial will be transferred to/from the 
institution/investigator , LEO  and third parties acting on behalf of LEO.  
Processing of personal data on behalf of LEO requires a written agreement between LEO and 
the relevant party which covers collection, processing and transfer of personal data in the 
clinical trial. In certain cases an agreement on transfer of personal data  may also be required.  
Investigators and LEO must ensure that collection, processing and transfer of personal data 
are in compliance with applicable legislation on data protection and privacy.  
Subjects (or their legally acceptable rep resentative)  must be a sked to consent to the collection, 
processing and tran sfer of their personal data to EU and non -EU countries for the purpose of 
conducting the clinical trial, research and development of new or existing products/services, 
improving existing products/servic es, applying for marketing authorisations for 
products/services, marketing of products/services and other related activities.  
LEO has obtained the necessary authorisations for the processing of person al data collected in 
the trial.  
Appendix 4 D: Record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , quality control,  and data handling  
Case report forms  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_421501] (e .g., laboratory data).  The investigator or staff authorised by [CONTACT_421502]. Data recorded in the eCRFs will be 
accessible to the trial site and LEO personnel immediately after entry. The CRFs must be 
maintained in an up -to-date state by [CONTACT_73353].  
The investigator mus t verify the correctness of the data entered by [CONTACT_421503]. This signature [CONTACT_73379]. Any correction(s) made by [CONTACT_421504]-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 122 of 156 
CRF after original entry will be documented in the audit trail. Changes to data already 
approved will require the re -signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_093]. The person making the change to 
the data, and the date, time and reason for the change will be ide ntified in the audit trail.  
Principles for data entry  
Clinically significant a bnormal findings at the (first) screening visit will be documented as 
medical history in the eCRF.  
If an abnormal finding (vita l signs, physical examination, laboratory  tests, ECG) at any other 
visit than the (first) screening visit is considered by [CONTACT_421472], it will be reported as an AE in accordance with Section  11.2. Further, any 
clinically significant deterioration of a pre -existing condition as well as any new clinically 
significant sign, symptom or illness observed after screening will be reported as an AE in 
accordance with Secti on 11.2. 
Source d ata 
For all data recorded, the source document must be defined in a source document agreement 
or similar document at each trial si te. There must only be one source defined at any time fo r 
any data elements.  
Source data should as a general rule be recorded in the subject ’s medical record or other 
defined document normally used at the trial site. Source data not normally collected as a  
routine part of the clinical practice at the site may be entered on a worksheet. Clinical 
assessments/safety evaluations must be sig ned by [CONTACT_73347].  
If the worksheet does not become part of the subject ’s medical record, the follo wing should as 
a minimum be added to the subject ’s medical record:  
Date(s) of conducti ng the informed consent process,  including date of
provision of subject information .
A statement from the investigator to verify that each of the eligibility criteria
are met.
Subject ID .
The fact that the subject is participating in a clinical trial in AD including
treatment arms of tralokinumab or placebo for 52 weeks ( 68 weeks in selected
countries) .
Other relevant medical information .

Page 123 of 156 
Trial monitoring  
During the course of the trial ,CRA(s)  will visit the trial site. These visits have the following 
objectives: (i) to perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the 
CRF by [CONTACT_18029], complete, and  verifiable from source 
documents; (ii) to confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and (iii) 
to confirm that the trial is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol 
and any other study agreements, ICH GCP , and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site ’s recruitment rate, the complia nce 
of the trial site with the protocol and GCP.  
In order to perform their role effectively, CRAs and persons involved  in quality assurance and  
inspections will need direct access  to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports,  
appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail , the 
investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant site 
staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits  
(e.g. by [CONTACT_756]).  
Protocol compliance  
Protocol  deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator . LEO will assess all 
protocol deviations and decide if any of these deviations must be reported to the regulatory  
authorities as a serious breach of GCP and the protocol, as required by [CONTACT_19666]. 
Protocol deviations will be included i n the CTR.  
Sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections  
The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by [CONTACT_421505] o r 
foreign regulatory authorities or from IRBs/IECs. Audits and inspections may take pla ce 
during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO staff have an 
obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and 
inspectors direct access to all source documents and other docume nts at the trial site relev ant 
to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, verify and reproduce any records  
and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial.  
If the trial site is contact[CONTACT_421506], LEO must be notif ied 
immediately.  
Data handling  
Subject data should be entered into the CRF as soon as possible after each visit in accordance 
with the requirements described in the Clinical Trial Agreement , if applicable . Queries for 
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 124 of 156 
discrepant data  will be generated automatically by [CONTACT_421507] , sponsor ’s medical expert,  or the data manager. All queries will be raised electronically 
within the electronic data capture  system. This systematic validation will ensure tha t a clean 
and consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis.  
An e lectronic PRO (ePRO) solution will be used to  capture patient -reported data ( data from 
questionnaires completed at the trial site and eDiary data ). By [CONTACT_73357], data will 
be available immediately after data entry and available for monitors and site personnel, 
including the investigator, with read access only.  The ePRO system is a separate application 
from the eCRF and data captured from the eCRF and the ePRO will be st ored on different 
servers during data capture. Data from both systems will be included in the final trial 
database.  
External data transfers from vendors to LEO will be transmitt ed and handled via a secure file 
transfer protocol  site.  
Transmissions of electronic data from external data providers and of ePRO data to the clinical 
database are illustrated in Panel 15.

Archiving of trial documentation  
The investigator at each trial site must make arrangements to  store the essential trial 
docu ments including the Investigator Trial File (ICH E6, Guideline for Good Clinical 
Practice) until LEO informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained  or 
longer if required by [CONTACT_54019].  
In addition, the investigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source docume nts 
so that the trial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial  (for 
example  in case of an inspection from regulatory autho rities).  
The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the 
investigator leaves the trial site or retires before the end of the required storage period.  
No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of 
LEO . No records may be transferred to another location or party without written acceptance 
from LEO .

Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.[ADDRESS_531859] be done in accordance 
with local regulatory requirements.  
For archiving purposes, each investigator will be supplied with a copy of the eCRFs and 
ePRO data for all subjects enrolled at the trial site. This is done after completion of the trial 
and before access to the eCRF/ePRO is revoked. Audit trail information wil l be included. 
eCRFs and ePRO data must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_421508], from regulatory authorities and/or IEC/IRBs.  
Appendix 4 E: Registration, reporting and publication policy  
Basic information of this clinical trial will be registered in the global data registry, 
www.clinicaltrials.gov before the first subject enters into the trial. The trial may also be come 
registered in other online data registries, according to applicable law and regulations.

LEO complies with recommendations from the Internationa l Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors and with the positions of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries 
and Associations (EFPIA), Japan Pharmaceutical Manufactur ers Association (JPMA) and 
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) on disclosure of 
information about clinical trials, trial results and authorship.  
Appendix 4 F: Insurance  
LEO has taken out relevant insurances covering the subjects in the present clinical trial in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  
Appendix 4 G: Financial disclosure  
Investigators will provide LEO with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to  
allow LEO to submit complete and accurate financ ial certification or disclosure statements to 
the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing informat ion 
on financial interests during the course of the clinical trial and for 1  year after completion  of 
the clinical trial, or for a longer period of time if required by [CONTACT_19666].  
Appendix 4 H: Committee structure  
Patient safety will be carefully assessed by [CONTACT_23275] 
(DMC). All members will be independent of the trial (i.e. they wi ll not be participating 
investigators or employees at participating sites) and of LEO (i.e. they will not be LEO 
employees). The DMC members are experienced with clinical trials and will be responsible 
for assessing the safety of the subjects through asses sment of the safety of the treatment 
regimen during the trial and through monitoring the overall conduct of the trial. Refer to 
Appendix [ADDRESS_531863] of trial committee members.  
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 128 of 156 
The DMC will review data on a regular basis. Additional meetings may also be called on an 
ad hoc basis, as requested by [CONTACT_421509]. All data collected at the time of the data 
cut-off/scheduled meetings will be included in the summaries for the  DMC, including data 
from subjects  still ongoing in the trial. The DMC will examine summaries and listings of 
AEs, specific laboratory parameters and subject disposition data as detailed in the DMC 
Charter. Full details of the analyses to be presented to t he DMC will be specified in a separate 
DMC statistical analysis plan.  
The DMC will have an independent statistician and an independent administrator who will 
remain independent of the trial management team.  
The chairman of the DMC, in conjunction with th e other members, will communicate their 
recommendations to LEO ’s clinical project  manager after each meeting. The chairman of the 
DMC will provide written reports to LEO after each formal review to indicate the 
committee’s recommendation regarding safety c oncerns and trial continuation. Further details 
on all aspects relating to the DMC are provided in the DMC charter . 
Appendix 4 I: Trial  and s ite closure  
Premature termination of trial or trial site 
LEO, the investigator, the IRB/IECs or competent authorities may decide to stop the clinical 
trial, part of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be followed 
must be obtained.  
If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the 
subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by [CONTACT_44536], the investigator or LEO must promptly inform IRB/IECs and 
provide a detailed written explanatio n. Relevant competent authorities must be informed.  
The trial must be terminated if the perception of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical 
signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes 
unfavourable for the continua tion of the trial.  
Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by [CONTACT_421510]:  
Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, LEO ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines.
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_093].
eDoc-00648766 - Version 5. 0
Trial ID: LP0162 -1326  Date: 14-Aug-2018  Version: 5.0 
Page 129 of 156 
Discontinuation of further IMP development.
Completion of trial  
Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease.  Trial enrolment will be 
stopped at a  trial site when the total requested number of subjects for the clinical trial has 
been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned inclusion number.  
Trial sites will be closed upon trial completion. LEO will undertake arrangements for the 
collec tion and disposal of any unused trial material that the investigator is not required to 
keep in his/her files.  A trial site is considered closed when all required documents and trial 
supplies have been collected and a trial site closure visit has been perf ormed.  
When the randomisation code has been broken, the investigators will receive information 
about the treatment allocation for the subjects randomised at their respective sites and will be 
asked to record this in the subject ’s medical record.  
Appendix 4 J: Responsibilities  
The international coordinating investigator (ICI)  is responsible for the approval of the 
(consolidated) clinical trial protocol, including any a mendment(s) and the CTR on behalf of 
all clinical trial investigators and as agreed to in an  International Coordinating Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_65908].  
The nat ional coordinating investigator s are responsible for national issues relating to the 
clinical trial as agreed to in a National Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_65908].  
Each participating investigator  is responsible for all aspects of the clinical trial conduct at 
his/her trial site as agreed to in a Clinical Trial Agreement.

Allergy Clin Immuno l. 2006;117 (2):391-397. 
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network Guidance for Anaphylaxis Diagnosis (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic 
reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. They recognize 3  categories of anaphylaxis, with 
criteria designated to capt ure from 80% of cases (category  1) to >95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for 
all 3 categories).  
Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly like ly when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1)Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)
Reduced blood pressure ( BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg,
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence )
2)Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for that
patient (minutes to several hours):
Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen
lips-tongue -uvula)
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF,
hypoxemia)
Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope,

Appendix  9: WHO model prescribing information for c lassification of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_421434] - and high -potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_030] (TCS).  TCS have been ranked in terms of potency into [ADDRESS_531866] potent ( Panel 16). 
Efficacy and side -effects are greatest with the Class I ultra -high-potency preparations which 
should only be used for limited time periods (2‒3 weeks).  
Representative preparations by [CONTACT_421512] ( 37). These groups may vary 
depending on the formulation and concentration and should be considered approximate. In 
general, ointments are more potent than creams or lotions. Potency is also increased when 
TCS are used under occlusive dressings or in intertriginous areas.

Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
Analysis of primary 
endpoints  This section has been amended to implement 
the concept of estimands together with the 
pre-specification of sensitivity analyses. The 
primary analyses of the primary endpoints are 
unchanged compared to the statistical

from this section:  
Reduction of at least [ADDRESS_531878] Daily Pruritus NRS
weekly average
Change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_531879] Daily Pruritus NRS weekly
average .The analysis of these 
endpoints is now covered by 
[CONTACT_421515] [IP_ADDRESS].1.  
For the PGI -B, a day of ‘no or slight bother’ 
is defined as answering the question with ‘not 
at all ’ or ‘slightly ’. The subjects’ number of 
days of ‘no or slight bother’ will be tabulated 
per treatment group for the initial treatment 
period. The mean number of days will be 
presented with 95% CIs and compared 
between the 2  treatment groups using an 
analysis of variance  model including 
treatment, region, and baseline IGA as 
factors. In this analysis, data collected after 
permanent discontinuation of IMP or after 
initiation of rescue medication will be 
disregarded.  Clarification regarding data 
collected after permanent 
discontinuation of IMP or 
after initiation of rescue 
medication, to align with the 
primary estimand for the 
continuous secondary 
endpoints.

Analysis of 
maintenance 
endpoints  The main changes are as follows:  
An estimand framework has been
introduced for the analysis of the
maintenance endpoints.  The primary
analysis provided in the statistical
analysis plan in the original protocol
dated 17 -Mar-2017 is  unchanged.
Clarification has been added on the
analysis set for the maintenance
endpoint s IGA of 0/1 at Week  52 and
EASI75 at Week  52.
The sensitivity analysis allowing TCS
treatment under certain conditions has
been removed ( mild to moderate
strengths [WHO classification] TCS, on
≤250 cm2 affected BSA, for ≤5
consecutive days, not more ofte n than
every 4  weeks, <[ADDRESS_531880] a 2 -week washout prior
to the Week  52 assessment) .
An LOCF sensitivity analysis has been
introduced.To conduct a  sensitivi ty 
analysis which is similar to 
the sensitivity analysis no. 2 
for the primary estimand for 
the primary endpoints . The 
sensitivity analysis described 
in the original 
protocol  – which allowed 
TCS under certain 
conditions  – is inconsistent 
with the rescue me dication 
algorithm applied in the 
initial treatment period.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_531881] is considered a 
supplementary exploratory

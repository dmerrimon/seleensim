1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims  
Identifying effective medications to treat alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a national public health 
priority. Combining pharmacological interventions with evidence -based behavioral treatments may help 
maximize and sustain AUD treatment outcomes1-3.  Alcohol Behavioral Couples Therapy (ABCT4) is a 
manualized, evidence -based psychotherapy for the treatment of AUD5-[ADDRESS_737023] employs cognitive behavioral techniques to (1) reduce alcohol consumption, (2) enhance 
partners’ skills to facilitate recovery (e.g., communication, managing cravings together), and (3) enhance relationship functioning. Although ABCT is a highly efficacious treatment, there is room for improvement in outcomes, as more than half of ABCT patients report hazardous drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_560828] 
a similar proportion fail to achieve abstinence
5,6,18,19.  
The neuropeptide oxytocin is a promising candidate to enhance ABCT via neurobiological and 
behavioral pathways including its potential to restore sensitivity to natural rewards such as interpersonal relationships
20. Neuroimaging studies indicate that dysregulation of corticolimbic brain circuitry is centrally 
involved in AUD pathophysiology21,22. Individuals with AUD demonstrate lower corticolimbic 
connectivity than healthy controls23,[ADDRESS_737024] male partners’ behavior
42. These nuanced 
findings may be explained by [CONTACT_560868]43, which proposes that rather than selectively 
enhancing prosocial behavior, oxytocin might universally amplify an individual’s current social tendencies which, in the context of addiction and relationship distress and without corrective intervention, may be 
maladaptive  
8,13,17. ABCT has demonstrated the ability to insulate couples from maladaptive relationship 
behaviors that are proven antecedents to hazardous drinking and relapse by [CONTACT_560869]  
44,45. Notably, treatment gains are greater among couples who 
begin ABCT with poorer relationship functioning and greater psychiatric comorbidity5 and within- session 
gains predict positive ABCT outcomes  44. Thus, a key approach to the therapeutic translation of oxytocin 
is to combine oxytocin with a behavioral intervention such as ABCT to reduce alcohol consumption. Doing so will ensure that oxytocin has an adaptive platform to enhance the positive gains ma de within ABCT 
sessions.  
The proposed study will test the efficacy of oxytocin to enhance ABCT  outcomes . We will also 
determine the effects of treatment on corticolimbic connectivity using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In order to accomplish this, we will employ a double- blind, placebo- controlled, randomized study design and examine standardized, repeated, dependent 
measures of change in: (1) alcohol consumption, (2) relationship functioning, and (3) corticolimbic connectivity in response to a validated in- scanner cue paradigm. Couples (N=100) will be randomly 
assigned to receive oxytocin (40 IU) or placebo prior to each of [ADDRESS_737025] therapy sessions. The following specific aims are proposed:  
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 3 of 29   Specific Aim 1 : Compare the efficacy of ABCT with oxytocin vs. placebo in reducing alcohol 
consumption.   
Specific Aim 2 : Compare the efficacy of ABCT with oxytocin vs. placebo in improving relationship 
functioning. Specific Aim 3 : Use neuroimaging to determine the effects of treatment on corticolimbic connectivity in 
response to alcohol and relationship conflict cues.

design.   Psychosocial Intervention: Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy (ABCT
25). All participants will 
receive [ADDRESS_737028] is to concurrently reduce AUD 
symptom severity and improve relationship functioning. Patients receive psychoeducation pertaining to the interconnectedness of AUD and relationship functioning. AUD -focused components of the treatment 
help patients identify and manage cravings , urges to drink, and thoughts about alcohol use ; enhance 
individual problem solving and decision- making abilities ; identify and plan for “high- risk” situations in 
which vulnerability to relapse is heightened; learn drink refusal skills ; and cope with a potential relapse. 
ABCT also teaches couples to work together to enhance reciprocity and communication skills in the relationship, increase positive rewards of initiating and maintaining drinking reductions and abstinence, and identifying and implementing ways partners can help minimize and manage alcohol use triggers, participate in drink refusal skills, and help prevent relapse.  
3.0 Study Endpoints   
Primary Outcome Measures. Primary outcomes include (1) alcohol consumption (percent days abstinent and heavy drinking as measured by [CONTACT_75236]) and (2) relationship functioning (DAS -7). Additional AUD 
outcomes include alcohol craving (PACS) and ethanol metabolites and traditional biomarkers (e.g., EtG and PEth) to corroborate participant self -reports of abstinence and alcohol use
121-123. PEth is among the 
most specific biomarkers used to detect heavy drinking and monitor abstinence124-126. The conjugated 
alcohol metabolite EtG remains positive in urine for several days following cessation and is a useful biomarker of recent drinking in outpatient settings
127. Selected assessment instruments are standardized, 
have good psychometric properties, are widely used, and have been used extensively by [CONTACT_116225].

 Page 4 of 29   • Time Line Follow -Back (TLFB128): The TLFB, which uses a calendar to stimulate recall, will assess 
consumption of alcohol  (e.g., number of standard drink units, percent of days drinking and abstinence , 
time span in which drinks were consumed),  drugs, and tobacco for 60 days prior to study entry, and 
during the treatment and follow-up phase.  
Relationship Functioning  
• Dyadic Adjustment Scale -7 (DAS -7129): The self -report DAS -7 is based on the original 32- item

psychometric properties129.  
 
4.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria / Study Population  
 
All participants will be at least 18 years of age.  Women and members of minority groups will be eligible 
for participation . 
 Inclusion criteria  are: 1) aged 18- 75, 2) English fluency and intellectual functioning sufficient to provide 
informed consent and accurately complete assessments and participate in treatment (as assessed by a criterion of < 26 on the Mini- Mental Status Exam [MMSE]

relationship  for ≥ 6 months , 5) one partner  must meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for current (i.e., past 12 
months) alcohol use disorder (assessed via the Quick Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Disorder ). 
Couples in which both partners meet diagnostic criteria for current AUD are eligible for participation, 6 ) 
maintenance of psychotropic medications on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before study initiation, and 5) concurrent substance use disorders (e.g., marijuana) are acceptable provided that alcohol is the participant’s  primary substance of choice. The inclusion of participants with substance use disorders is 
essential because of the marked frequency of co -occurrence among patients with AUD.

5.0 Number of Subjects  
 100 couples will be enrolled (200 total participants).    
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 5 of 29    
6.0 Setting 
 
All procedures will be conducted on the MUSC campus or in VA research offices . Procedures can also be 
conducted via telehealth.   
7.0 Recruitment Methods  
 Recruitment sites will include the Center for Drug and Alcohol Programs (CDAP) at MUSC , the Ralph H. 
Johnson VAMC Substance Treatment and Recovery (STAR ) clinic , and other in state and out of state VA 
clinics (e.g., Savannah CBOC). CDAP, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Joshua Smith, is an inpatient and outpatient addictions treatment facility with approximately 398 inpatient and 880 outpatient annual admissions. There were 1,279 new CDAP admissions in 2017 (~106/month) with the majority of patient s (75 -80%) seeking 
AUD tre atment. The STAR clinic is directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Karen Hartwell and [CONTACT_235926] (Co -I) is a Staff 
Psychologist in STAR. Consults for treatment are made directly to the STAR intake team. In 2017, STAR delivered 1,460 unique patient visits (682 AUD patients; 56 patie nts/month). An additional recruitment site 
will be the outpatient Ralph H. Johnson VAMC Couples and Family Clinic, directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Julian Libet. 
The Couples and Family Clinic received 433 and 408 unique patient intakes in 2016 and 2017, respectively. We need to enroll 2- 4 couples per month to complete the study within the proposed timeline . No other 
studies are enrolling couples at the proposed recrutiment sites. Thus, there should be no difficulty recruiting an adequate sample. Participants will also be recruited through IRB -approved flyers posted in (a) VAMC 
Women’s Health Clinic, Primary Care Clinic, and Emergency Department; (b) affiliated community based outpa tient clinics; and (c) MUSC treatment clinics. Finally, we will place advertisements on social 
networking sites (e.g., Craigslist, Facebook) , in local newspapers, and television. Participants who refer 
others to the study will be compensated $[ADDRESS_737030] indicated consent to be contact[CONTACT_560871].  Our research team has success fully used these methods in previous 
and ongoing clinical trials among individuals and couples with AUD.   College students ages 18 -75 enrolled at area colleges and universities will be contact[CONTACT_560872] (no participants will be recruited until an interinstitutional agreement is signed by [CONTACT_560873], submitted as an amend ment to the MUSC IRB, and approved by [CONTACT_165469]). 
Potential participants will be sent a recruitment email that includes details about the study (e.g., time requirement, basic inclusion criteria, compensation), a link to the IRB approved screener, and contact [CONTACT_560874]. Potential participants will also be contact[CONTACT_65312].  Chart review and EPIC /VINCI lists  will be used for recruitment; only individuals who have previously 
agreed to be contact[CONTACT_560875]. The study team will use an IRB approved letter and script will be used to inform identified individuals about our study.  Participants will be recruited and enrolled from all 50 states.  The protocol/NIH grant application was 
written pre -COVID 19, where we had various recruitment methods that included in- person collaboration 
with providers and clinics, as well as physical methods of recruitment (like flyering) from community locations (bar s and clinics, etc). Since the COVID [ADDRESS_737031] fully virtual/digital. With the shift in recruitment methods, the market has become saturated throughout most of our social media outlets. We have also difficulty getting new methods of recruitment strategies/platforms approved by 
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 6 of 29   MUSC/SC purchasing restrictions. Thus, the inclusion of participants out of state increases the pool of 
potential participants, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_560831]19.  
Further, the inclusion of out of state participants allows us to enroll more veterans referred through the VA system, as Savannah CBOC is part of the RHJVA.  Also, out of state recruitment allows for a more diverse study sample. Recruitment of out of state participants will be accomplished through social media advertisements targeted at out of state areas. The advertisements will include our study screener . Study staff will connect with the potential participant 
based on the method of contact [CONTACT_560876]. Our study contact [CONTACT_560877].    
8.0 Consent Process  
 
Potential participants will be given a full description of the study procedures and asked to read and 
sign an IRB -approved informed consent form before any study procedures or assessments are conducted. 
Individuals who were recruited from the VA will also be required to read and sign a VA R&D –approved 
consent. Additionally, VA participants and their partners who are recruited from the VA will only be 
consented by [CONTACT_560878]. Informed consent will take place 
on the MUSC campus  or via telehealth , using an IRB approved platform, such as Doxy.Me or RedCap. 
Initial eligibility screening will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] , Co- Is, Coordinator, or a trained research assistant 
by [CONTACT_52062]. If preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, staff will schedule an assessment appointment for the couple. In a private room  apart  from  their partner,  participants  will be 
provided with a description  of the nature  and requirements  of study participation, and asked  to read and 
sign an IRB-approved  consent form prior to beginning any study procedures   In the event of eConsent, the 
informed consent process will still take place privately. If couples do not have the a bility to each have a 
private room for eConsent (within their residence(s), separate appointments may be arranged to maintain privacy and to meet with each individual partner separately .  In the case of a VA consent, a VA consent 
document will either be mailed or emailed to the participant.  PI/study team will use government furnished equipment to video call with the participant and go over the document.  Once the document is signed, the participant will be asked to hold it up to the screen and a screenshot will be taken and saved for records.  
VA participants and their partners who are recruited from the VA will be given a VA Notice of Privacy 
Practices in addition to a copy of their consent.

baseline assessment. In a private room apart from their partner, participants will be given a full description 
of the study procedures and asked to read and sign an IRB -approved informed consent form before any 
study procedures are conducted. In the event of telehealth, separate appointments will be made to meet with 
each individual partner separately. Consent will be conducted by [CONTACT_32341] (PI, Co- Is, Study Coordinator , 
or Research Assistant ). Ineligible participants will be given treatment referrals as needed.  During 1-[ADDRESS_737034] strip (to test current BAC) , 
pregnancy test (for women), ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth) testing, a history and physical (H&P) exam, urine drug screen (UDS), a battery of standardized self -report and interview 
measures (Table 1) .,. Note that for telehealth participants, biological specimens will not be collected, 
however, female participants will be required to take a pregnancy test (provided by [CONTACT_464]) and will be required to verbally confirm a negative result prior to continuing with any procedures.  H&P exams will 
include a physical and neurological examination; orthostatic blood pressure and pulse measurements; and weight and BMI calculation. In the event of telehealth baseline appointment, biological measures will not 
be collected.  Prov ided full eligibility criteria are met, participants  will schedule visits to complete  script 
development needed for the fMRI sessions  and a fMRI session (described in the Neuroimaging Procedures 
section). Participants will then enter the treatment phase, which is a 12- week, double -blind, placebo 
controlled RCT during which they will receive weekly ABCT therapy sessions in combination with oxytocin or placebo (see Study Interventions and Procedures Section). Intranasal oxytocin has a half -life of 
approximate ly 3- [ADDRESS_737035] Pharmacy . Participants will complete 
3- and 6 -month follow -up visits. AUD symptoms, relationship functioning, associated problems (e.g., 
depression), UDS, EtG, and adverse events will be assessed weekly. In addition, participants wil l be asked 
to complete a breathalyzer /alcohol saliva test strip  while in the same room; after which they will be taken 
to separate rooms until it is time for therapy.  PEth will be examined at baseline, weeks 6 and 12, and at 
both follow -up assessments. Blood samples will be refrigerated until sent to out for assay. T herapy sessions 
may be videotaped, with participant consent. In order to explore secondary outcomes such as the effects of 
treatment on within -session behaviors, we will employ observational coding to assess frequency of positive, 
negative, and alcohol change talk behaviors (using the SCCIT-A
133) in ABCT sessions 1, 4, 8, and 12.

Telehealth : Participants in this research study may choose to complete appointments  via home -based 
telehealth (HBT) care (i.e., service delivery to patients in their homes using consumer -friendly, video-
conferencing technology) which may likely enhance retention by [CONTACT_560880] w ith traveling to MUSC/VA for in -person sessions. Further, telehealth 
allows the study team to recruit and enroll participants who are located outside of the state of South Carolina (inside continental US). HBT sessions will be delivered via standard desk, laptop computer, tablet, or smartphone running MUSC/VA approved applications. Participants who choose telehealth will be required to have their own computer, tablet, or smartphone; however, webcams will be provided to participants for these visits  as needed.  Participants will be mailed required materials such as alcohol saliva test strips, 
pregnancy tests, and medication. Separate appointments will be made with each partner for instances where study team needs to meet with each individual separately or privately.  
Biological samples will not be collected for individuals participating in HBT care, however prior to the baseline appointment the study team will mail pregnancy tests and alcohol saliva strips to test for pregnancy and recent alcohol use. The alcohol saliva strip must read white (indicative of 0.[ADDRESS_737038] during those visits (provided by [CONTACT_15328]) and confirm a negative result  (verbally and with 
photo of dipstick). The pregnancy tests used in this study are designed for at -home use, come with clear 
and simple instructions. In very rare and highly unlikely circumstances where the participant is unfamiliar with how to provide a urine sample or take an at -home pregnancy test, study staff can provide further 
instructions on how to provide  a urine sample, how use the dipstick to test, and to differentiate between a 
positive and negative result. Ability and willingness to perform an at -home pregnancy test is required for 
telehealth female participants.  
 Study medication and other study required study materials will be shipped overnight from research pharmacy to participant’s designated location at the agreed upon date using overnight shippi[INVESTIGATOR_560833] (FedEx, UPS) and with appropriate ice packs and temperature monitoring device as well as a signature [CONTACT_560901]. Regarding all telehealth  participants  (including out of 
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 9 of 29   state):  Research  participants  will be asked  to retrieve  the study drug from  their refrigerator at the beginning 
of each check -in video telehealth  session  with study  staff.  Participants  will self-administer  the medication  
while  in view  of the study staff on screen.  Once  medication  is administered,  participant  will be instructed  
to return  drug to  their  refrigerator  prior to  continuing with  the remainder  of the appointment.  
 
Optional Neuroimaging Procedures.  fMRI scans will be completed with participants  and conducted at 
the MUSC Center for Biomedical Imaging (CBI; see Facilities and Resources), which houses a Siemens 3T Prisma MRI scanner (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]). Neuroimaging sessions (Figure 5) will last approximately [ADDRESS_737039] at baseline and week 12. A fter baseline, personalized imagery 
scripts will be developed for alcohol and neutral cues according to the manualized procedures described by [CONTACT_351762]
147, which are currently being utilized in several of our team’s ongoing federally-funded 
pharmacological trials for AUD. Participants will also develop a relationship conflict cue consistent with our past work. The VAS will be administered prior to, during, and after scanning to  track perceived craving. 
Participants will be screened for metal using a self -report questionnaire and a handheld metal detector. 
Trained staff will position participants on the scanner bed with foam padding placed around their head to prevent motion. Participants will wear headph ones to listen to the audio- recorded cues. During initial 
scanner tuning, localizing, and structural scanning, participants will be shown “relaxing” images (i.e., 20 scenic pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], each displayed for 30 seconds). For co -registration and normalization of functional images, 
a high resolution T1- weighted MPRAGE anatomical image will be acquired with the following parameters: 
TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.26 ms, flip angle = 8°, field of view = 256 mm, slice thickness 1.0 mm, 192 slices. The scanning planes will be or iented parallel to the anterior commissure –posterior commissure line.  
 Next, participants will be asked to relax and keep their eyes opened and fixed on a cross -hair while 
resting state data are collected across two [ADDRESS_737040] time they consumed alcohol. During the trauma cue block, participants will hear an audio recording descr ibing in detail their 
traumatic event. Between the alcohol cue and trauma cue blocks, participants will hear an audio recording describing something neutral, such as their typi[INVESTIGATOR_560834] . The same excerpt will be used for each 
run. To minimize potential carry -over effects, the scans will be counterbalanced so that half of the 
participants in each treatment arm (e.g., oxytocin or placebo) are exposed to the alcohol cue first and the remaining participants in each group are exposed to the relationship conflict cue first. This order will be preserved from pre - to post -treatment scanning for each participant. T2*- weighted gradient -echo planar 
images (EPI) will be acquired with the following parameters: TR = 1100 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 65º, matrix 64 x 64, field of view = 192 mm, slice thickness = 3 mm with no gap, multiband factor = 3, with [ADDRESS_737041] for geometric distortions cause by [CONTACT_560881].  Compensation. Each participant will each receive $100 for completion of the baseline assessment visit, up 
to $[ADDRESS_737042] sessions (on an escalating scale), and $100 for each follow- up visit. 
Participants who are eligible and choose to complete the neuroimaging component of the study will also 
receive $30 for the script development session and $[ADDRESS_737043]-treatment neuroimaging scans . Thus, participants  who complete all study components may receive $1,100 total. If obstacles of 
transportation prevent participation, the study team will offer bus, taxi, or mileage reimbursement as needed.  Mileage reimbursement is available for individuals who travel more than 50 miles to Charleston. 
Reimbursement will be provided at the state -approved rate, and will be capped at 100 miles . Compensation 
types may include, but are not limited to: checks, cash, or gift certificates/cards.   
10.0 Specimen Collection and Banking   
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 10 of 29   Urine samples will be collected for pregnancy testing, urine drug screens, and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) 
testing. Blood samples will be collected from participants in this study for  examining phosphatidyl ethanol 
(PEth). Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_560882]. Only approved study staff will have access to data 
associated with specimens.  
 
11.0 Data Management  and Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
General. Baseline clinical and  descriptive characteristics will be examined and compared between 
treatment groups using chi -square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, t -tests, or Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as 
appropriate.  Baseline characteristics that are significantly different between treatment groups will be included as model covariates.  The primary analysis will focus on end- of-treatment (i.e ., the final three 
weeks of the treatment phase) outcomes using an intent -to-treat framework.   
 Randomization. Both partners in each couple will be randomized to the same drug condition in a one -to-
one manner utilizing a randomized permuted block design. In order to ensure that the treatment groups are balanced with respect to alcohol consumption (TLFB), a stratified randomization process will be used.  
We p
lan to use REDCap and VA REDCap for data capture and management. REDCap (Research Electronic 
Data Capture) is a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research and clinical trial data (Harris et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2007). REDCap provides secure, web-
-ba
sed flexible applications, including real time validation rules with automated data type and range checks 
at the time of entry. Exports are made available for several statistical packages including SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and Microsoft Excel. The system allows the research team to create and engage respondents using a variety of notification methods. 
 
R
EDCap data dictionaries can be distributed for reuse at multiple institutions. A library of data dictionaries 
is made available for standards --b
ased data collection forms and validated instruments (Obeid et al., 2012). 
T
he underlying database is hosted in a secure data center at MUSC/VA, a secure environment for data 
systems and servers on campus, and includes redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The system has several layers of protect ion including, user/group account management, 
"Data Access Groups" which allow data to be entered by [CONTACT_253757], audit trails for all changes, queries and reports, and Secure Sockets Layer (S SL) 
encryption.    Power and Sample Size. This study is powered to detect moderate treatment group differences in percent days abstinent (PDA) and percent of days of heavy drinking (PDH), and relationship functioning as measured by [CONTACT_560883] -7, respectively at end -of-treatment (weeks 9 -12). Assuming 2- sided 
hypothesis testing and alpha levels of 0.05, we will have 80% power to detect treatment group differences with effect sizes of 0.6 in the presence of 30% attrition (n=70 couples) during the treatment phase. This approach is consistent with treatment group differences in PDA ( d=0.59) and PDH improvements ( d=0.79) 
in a prior ABCT trial (n=102)
26, although we recognize that that trial compared individual therapy vs. ABCT 
(not ABCT ± medication).  In that study, PDA increased from 34.98% ± 29.17% to 80.52% ± 27.75% at the end of treatment in the ABCT group, and PDH decreased from 56.83% ± 28.87% to 10.52% ± 22.16% in the ABCT group. Incorporating an arcsine or other appropriate transformation to account for non-normality of these metrics will enable us to discern whether oxytocin enhances end of treatment PDA by [CONTACT_560884] 9% or greater (i.e., to 80.5% in the ABCT+ placebo group vs. 89.5% in the ABCT + oxytocin group) and whether oxytocin further decreases PDH by [CONTACT_15734] 6% or greater (i.e., to 10.5% 
V18 3.8.[ADDRESS_737044]+ placebo group vs. 4.5% in the ABCT + oxytocin group). Another prior ABCT trial 
found that DAS -7 scores (21.1 ± 6.7) remain relatively constant throughout treatment27. We will have 80% 
power to detect treatment group differences of [ADDRESS_737045], as observed and unobserved covariates will theoretically be balanced across treatment groups. In addition, less than 10% missing data generally has 
little impact on power and does not introduce bias, regardless of the missing data mechanism. If the percent missing data are greater than 10%, multiple imputation techniques will be used to examine the influence of missing data on our study findings.  If data are missing not at random, propensity score methods will be 
considered for data imputation. In the propensity score method, first the distribution of the missing indicator variable given the observed data is modeled to derive a propensity score. Then observations are grouped on these propensity scores and an approximate Bayesian bootstrap imputation is applied to each group.  Hypotheses and statistical approaches for testing each are described below.  
 Hypothesis 1:  The ABCT + oxytocin group will demonstrate significantly greater reduction in alcohol 
consumption from baseline to end of treatment as compared to the ABCT + placebo group (PDA and PDH measured by [CONTACT_101608]). Hypothesis 2:  The ABCT + oxytocin group will demonstrate significantly greater improvement in 
relationship functioning (measured by [CONTACT_50999] -7) from baseline to end of treatment as compared to the ABCT 
+ placebo group.  To test hypotheses 1 and 2, a general linear modeling (GLM) framework will be used, treating end-of-
treatment (weeks 9 -12) PDA, PDH, and DAS -7 scores as dependent variables (in separate models), and 
treating treatment group (ABCT + oxytocin vs. ABCT + placebo) as the primary independent variable. Baseline values for PDA, PDH, and DAS -7 will be included as covariates, along with other potentially 
significant baseline characteristics. Since PDA and PDH may exhibit non -Gaussian distributional forms 
and/or zero- inflation, alternative modeling strategies (e.g., arcsine or Box- Cox transformations, two- part 
Hurdle models) may need to be explored. Model fit will be compared by [CONTACT_560885]-square values. If transformations are necessary, back -transformations will be used in conveying the 
model results. Similar modeling strategies will be used for secondary exploratory outcomes (described below). 
 
Hypothesis 3a:  PFC-AMY functional connectivity after treatment will be greater in participants who 
receive ABCT+ oxytocin compared to those who receive ABCT + placebo.  
Hypothesis 3b : Baseline PFC -AMY functional connectivity in response to alcohol vs. neutral cues will 
predict the magnitude of change in alcohol use (PDA and PDH measured by [CONTACT_560886] 3 weeks of treatment).  
Hypothesis 3c : Baseline PFC -AMY functional connectivity in response to relationship conflict vs. neutral 
cues will predict amount of change in relationship functioning (IP DAS -7 scores in the final 3 weeks of 
treatment).  
 For hypothesis 3, preprocessing and analysis of fMRI data will use FSL v 5.0
148. Preprocessing includes 
rigid -body head motion correction of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_560835] a run, high- pass temporal filtering (sigma = 150 
seconds), geometric distortion correction, slice timing correction, spatial filtering (FWHM = 6 mm) and registration to the MNI  standard brain template. ‘fsl_motion_outliers’ will be used to determine head motion 
outliers which will be used a covariate of no interest in statistical analysis (together with the 6 rigid -body 
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 12 of 29   translation and rotation head motion parameters). The primary analysis of fMRI data will use 
psychophysiological interaction (PPI) modeling149 with a seed region defined in the right AMY region from 
the Harvard –Oxford probabilistic structural atlas thresholded at 50%. Time series will be extracted from 
each participant’s right AMY using ‘fslmeants” after warpi[INVESTIGATOR_560836] t’s EPI 
[CONTACT_318643]. This time series will serve as the physiological regressor for each run. The primary psychological regressors are based on the alcohol cue blocks in the alcohol run or the conflict cue blocks in the conflict run. The interaction between the primary psychological regressor for each run and the physiological regressor is the primary variable of interest.  
fMRI analysis : To assess whether corticolimbic connectivity is modulated by [CONTACT_300854], the 
parameter estimate from the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_560837], opercular portion (IFC; - 47, 18, 6) in each participant. The IFC regions-of- interest (ROI) are based on our 
preliminary study where the right AMY was functionally connected to the left IFC for the conflict cue, especially in women. In addition, the right IFC is strongly implicated in behavioral inhibition
[ADDRESS_737046] -treatment will be used in statistical analyses testing hypotheses 
1 and 2 (described above). Because the hypothesized ROI may not yield the most robust response, we w ill 
also conduct a whole -brain, voxel -wise PPI [INVESTIGATOR_560838] a function of treatment. The voxel -wise PPI [INVESTIGATOR_560839] (alcohol, conflict) but pre- and post- treatment sessions will be treated as a repeated 
measure. Group -level analyses will be carried out using FLAME 1 (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed 
Effects) to generate z statistical images for each interaction term in each run. The final statistical maps will be cluster thresholded at Z=2.33, p = .05) and will indicate which regions show the greatest change in connectivity with the right AMY as a function of treatment group.   Exploratory Hypothesis 4: The ABCT + oxytocin group will demonstrate significantly greater 
improvement in frequency of within- session behaviors (i.e., positive, negative, and alcohol change -talk 
behaviors measured by [CONTACT_560887] -A133 at sessions 1, 4, 8, and 12)  as compared to the ABCT + placebo 
group.  To test exploratory hypotheses, a nonlinear mixed effects modeling framework will be used, where 
nonlinearity is likely to arise when participants transition from the treatment to follow -up phase. Separate 
models will be constructed for IPs and their partners. Time -specific outcome data will serve as dependent 
variables (in separate models, with treatment group being the primary independent variable of interest.  Baseline values for PDA, PDH, DAS -7 and sex will be included as covariates, along with other potentially 
significant baseline characteristics. Models will include linear (and possibly non- linear) effects for time 
through the 6- month follow -up, allowing for changes in time effects to occur at end- of-treatment (i.e., using 
a regression ‘join -point’). Random subject effects will be incorporated to account for the fact that within -
subject measurements over time are correlated with each other. Autoregressive covariance structures along with other structures (e.g., compound symmetry, spatial power) will be  investigated, with final models 
based on Akaike Information Criterion. When examining outcomes involving counts (i.e., positive, negative, and alcohol change -talk behaviors), we will assume these variables follow Poisson and/or negative 
binomial distribut ions, accompanied by [CONTACT_26500]- link functions within a generalized linear mixed models 
framework.   
 
12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
 Summary  of the Protocol. The proposed  Stage II study will examine the efficacy of  oxytocin  in combination 
with a behavioral intervention (ABCT) in reducing alcohol use disorder (AUD) severity and improving 
relationship functioning  among couples. We will also examine the ability of oxytocin to modify 
corticolimbic connectivity from pre - to post -treatment. Primary  outcomes  include AUD symptom severity 
V18 3.8.[ADDRESS_737047]. Flanagan (PI) will be responsible for monitoring the trial. The  study will be managed  
from  the Addiction Sciences  Division  within  the Department  of Psychiatry  and Behavioral Sciences  at the 
Medical  University  of South  Carolina (MUSC), College of Medicine, Charleston, SC.  
 Responsible Party. [CONTACT_560902] (PI) and [CONTACT_335437] (Co -I and Study Physician) will be responsible for 
distinguishing between serious (SAEs) and non -serious adverse events (AEs), and determining study 
relatedness.   DSM  Board . We will create a DSMB  to monitor overall  participant  safety,  the rate and severity  of adverse  
events,  and the validity  and integrity  of the data.  The panel  includes 2 researchers  with experience in 
treating  patients  with AUD (Lindsay Squeglia, Ph.D. and Kevin Gray,  M.D. ) and a biostatistician  (Amy 
Wahlquist ). The board may be called  at any point  if needed  for unexpected AEs,  etc. Modifications will 
be made  in the procedures and/or the protocol if necessary  based  on the recommendations  of the 
board. Confidentiality  will be maintained  during all phases  of the study.  
 Adverse Events . An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any unwanted change, physically, psychologically or 
behaviorally, that occurs in a study participant during the course of the study that may or may not be related to study participation. AEs are reportable to the local Institutional Review B oard (IRB) if the AE is 
unexpected AND related or possibly related AND serious or more prevalent than expected. The IRB definition of unexpected  is that the AE is not identified in nature, severity or frequency in the current protocol, 
informed consent, in vestigator brochure or with other current risk information. The definition of related  is 
that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641], device or intervention. All AEs will be reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_978], and annually by [CONTACT_39109] (DSMB), MUSC IRB, and VA Research an d Development. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined 
as an adverse event that has one of the following outcomes: results in death, is life -threatening, requires 
inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, OR requires intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.   AE/ Unanticipated Problem Follow -up. Unanticipated problems, potential AEs and SAEs will be identified 
during the study via self -report data, as well as weekly assessments and interviews. All unexpected AEs and 
SAEs will be monitored until resolved. A detailed summary of all AEs will be pre pared weekly by [CONTACT_253759] [INVESTIGATOR_560840].  
 Risks of Study Participation . Risks of participation related to oxytocin safety, pregnancy, neuroimaging, and 
confidentiality are outlined in the Human Subjects Section. Well -established strategies to protect participants 
from risks are also outlined.  
 Safety Reporting . All unexpected AEs will be reported to the MUSC IRB and NIH within [ADDRESS_737048] officer. This report will include 1) confirmation of adherence to the DSMP, 2) a summary of any data and safety monitoring issues that have arisen since the previous report, 3) a description of any changes in the study protocol or DSMP that might possibly affect risk, and 4) all new and continuing IRB approvals.  
AEs and SAEs occurring during the course of study will be collected, documented, and reported in 
accordance with protocol and IRB reporting requirements. All research staff involved with AE reporting will receive training including identification, evaluati on, documentation and reporting. All research staff will 
identify any potential AEs during the course of the study from self -report data and administration of 
assessments and interviews. This information will be provided to the PI, who will be responsible for AE/SAE assessment and evaluation including a determination of seriousness and study relatedness.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] 
a serious adverse experience when,  based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
When a reportable SAE is identified, research staff will initiate an SAE form, and the following 
individuals will be notified within 48 hours of knowledge of the SAE: study co- investigators, the MUSC 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), the NIAAA project officer, and members of the Data Safety Monitoring Board. If complete information is not available when the initial [ADDRESS_737049] officer as appropriate. I n addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a signed, dated SAE summary report, which will be 
sent to the NIAAA Medical Safety Officer within two weeks of the initial SAE report.  
 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.  
 Inclusion criteria  
1) Male or female; any race or ethnicity; aged 18-75 years.  
2) Able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual level sufficient to allow accurate completion of the assessment instruments (> 26 on the Mini- Mental State Exam).  
3) Married, cohabiting , or in a committed relationship  for ≥ 6 months. 
 
4) Identified Patients (IPs) must meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for current (i.e., past 12  months) 
alcohol use disorder (assessed via the MINI). Couples in which both partners meet diagnostic criteria for current AUD are eligible for participation. 
5) Concurrent substance use disorders (e.g., marijuana) are acceptable provided that alcohol is the IP’s primary substance of choice.  
6) Participants taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable dose for at least four weeks before study initiation. This is because initiation or change of psychotropic medications during the course of the trial may interfere w ith interpretation of results.  
 Exclusion criteria  
1) Meeting DSM -5 criteria for a history of or current psychotic or bipolar affective disorders, or with 
current suicidal or homicidal ideation and intent. Those individuals will be referred clinically for treatment.  
2) Participants who present a serious suicide risk or are likely to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16366].  
3) Participants on psychotropic medications which have been initiated during the past [ADDRESS_737050] four week s on a stable dose.  
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 15 of 29   4) Acute alcohol withdrawal as indicated by [CONTACT_253748] -Ar scores >8. They may be re -assessed once they 
are no longer in withdrawal. Those individuals will be referred for medically supervised 
detoxification.  
5) Severe unilateral intimate partner violence in the past 6 months as defined by [CONTACT_30820]-2. 
6) Pregnancy or breastfeeding for women.  
7) Individuals with implanted metal devices above the waist will be eligible to enroll in the clinical trial but will not be eligible to participate in the neuroimaging component of the study.  
 Study  Safety . [CONTACT_560902]  (PI) or [CONTACT_235926] (Co -I) will be present or on call at the time of all study 
visits. The proposed study does not involve alcohol or drug administration. Females who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding are ineligible to participate due to the known effects of the study drug (oxytocin) on parturition and lactation. Couples must agree to use a reli able method of birth control and female 
participants will complete pregnancy tests each week during the treatment phase  (for telehealth participants, 
pregnancy tests will be provided and study staff will require a verbal confirmation of negative pregnancy test prior to medication administration) . If one of the participants becomes pregnant during the trial (despi[INVESTIGATOR_560841]), the study staff will continue to follow the 
participant through the course of the pregnancy. Further, since this is an intent -to-treat trial,  participants 
will be allowed to continue in engage in therapy offered as part of standard of care in this trial. Participants who become pregnant  will no longer be allowed to engage in the experimental portion of the trial and the 
study medication will no longer be administered. Additionally, they will not be  asked questions or 
administered  surveys regarding illegal substance use. Participants who become pregnant will also be 
excluded from completing urine drug screens.  Since ABCT is the standard of care for couples where one 
individual meets AUD criteria, continuing to allow both participants to participate in the standard of care portion of the trial holds the prospect of direct benefit to the participant and is in the best interest of the participant.  Protocols for reported  AEs and SAEs  are outlined  above. All unexpected  AEs and SAEs  will 
be monitored  until resolved. A detailed  summary  of all AEs will be prepared  weekly  by [CONTACT_253760].  At the weekly  team  meetings  (or before  if urgent), the research  staff will report  any premonitory 
symptoms  of clinical  deterioration. Study  procedures will follow the FDA’s  Good  Clinical Practice  
Guidelines (www.fda.gov/oc/gcp). Any outside requests  for information  or any breaches  in confidentiality  
will be reported to [CONTACT_560902].  All requests  by [CONTACT_3445]’s  physicians  and other medical  providers  will 
be referred  directly  to the applicant.  
 Follow- Up Phase. All participants will be provided with a list of community resources upon study 
completion. Individuals presenting at any time with serious mental or physical health symptoms including acute alcohol withdrawal will be referred clinically for treatment. All AEs occurring during the follow -up 
phase will be reported to MUSC IRB and NIAAA.  SAEs occurring during the follow -up phase will be 
reported to MUSC IRB and NIAAA within 48 hours. Any participant demonstrating clinical deterioration will be referred clin ically consistent with the procedures outlined in the Human Subjects section. In the event 
that emergency evaluation or intervention is necessary, the participant will be escorted by a study staff 
member to the psychiatric walk -in clinic or emergency room. Psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560842].  Data Management  and Analysis . A data analytic plan (including power calculation) is outlined in the Data 
Analysis section. This study is powered to examine the efficacy of oxytocin versus placebo on the primary outcomes of interest. The main outcome variables include the severity of AUD, relationship functioning, and corticolimbic connectivity determined via neuroimaging procedures. Analyses will be guided by [CONTACT_275631], [CONTACT_453255]. Post-hoc exploratory analyses will be conducted with two- tailed tests and more conservative statistical procedures 
which guard against Type I error (e.g., Tukey tests). All primary hypotheses will be tested at level of 
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 16 of 29   significance α=0.05. We will also estimate the effect sizes of interest and provide 95% confidence intervals. 
Please see the Statistical Analysis and Power section for more details.  
 Quality  Assurance and Confidentiality. Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_560888]. Project therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560843]- Is (Drs. Flanag an, Back, and 
McCrady). Dr. McCrady developed the ABCT intervention which will be utilized in the proposed study and is currently being tested in several federally -funded trials to examine various adaptations of ABCT.  
Adherence to the manual will be monitored using videotapes and weekly supervision. If therapy drift is observed the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_169422]-trained. Booster sessions will be held annually.  DSM  Plan Administration . The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_560844]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a 
statistician  will examine  the outcomes  database for missing  data,  unexpected  distributions  or responses,  
and outliers.  A DSMB  report  will be filed with the IRB on a yearly  basis,  unless  greater  than expected  
problems occur. The report will include participant characteristics,  retention  and disposition  of study 
participants,  quality  assurance issues  and reports of AEs and  SAEs.  We will report main outcome results  
at the  end of the trial. An annual report of all AEs will be submitted to the NIAAA project officer. In 
addition, all  AEs will be  reviewed  weekly  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Flanagan , and annually  by [CONTACT_4318] , local IRB and VA 
Research and Development. Any significant  actions  taken  by [CONTACT_560889].   
For any SAE, the appropriate SAE protocol specific reporting forms will be completed and 
disseminated to the appropriate persons and within the designated timeframes as indicated above. If 
complete  information  is not available  when  the initial SAE  report is  disseminated,  follow -up information  
will be gathered  to enable a complete  assessment  and outcome of the event.  This information may include  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139257], autopsy reports,  clinic  records,  etc. The research  staff will attach  copi[INVESTIGATOR_560845]. Flanagan  and for forwarding to the NIAAA Program  
Officer.  In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a signed, dated  SAE  summary report, which  will be sent to the 
NIAAA Medical  Safety  Officer within  2 weeks  of the initial SAE  report.  Follow -up of all unexpected  and 
serious  AEs will be reported to  all regulatory entities including the local IRB, DSMB, and NIAAA.  
For each AE/SAE recorded, the research staff will follow the AE/SAE until resolution, stabilization, or until the subject is no longer in the study.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_253738].  The trial will be stopped under any of the following conditions: 1) there 
is clear evidence of harm; 2) there is no likelihood of demonstrating treatment benefit, or 3) there is overwhelming evidence of the benefit of treatment.  ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements: In accordance with Public Law 110- 85, the proposed trial will be 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Applicable requirements regarding results reporting will be adhered to.   
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects   
 All participants will be screened thoroughly for eligibility following informed consent. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_560846] a participant demonstrates or reports significant distress, presents a risk of harm to self or others, or is otherwise unable to complete the study.  Participants may withdraw from participation at any time during the study procedure. Clinical referrals to community resources will be provided to all study participants.  
14.0 Risks to Subjects  
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 17 of 29    
Oxytocin Safety:  Oxytocin is a neuropeptide commonly administered intravenously among women 
during childbirth. Risks associated with oxytocin administration have been noted among women given 
intravenous, but not intranasal, oxytocin for its FDA -approved purpose to induce labor and facilitate 
lactation135,136. These risks include seizures, mental disturbances, nausea, vomiting, irregular heartbeat, high 
blood pressure, and unexpected bleeding or contraction of the uterus and have been observed in a small number of women
99. However, preliminary studies conducted by [CONTACT_560890] 40 IU is minimal and manageable through the proposed human participants protection methods. Our group has administered intranasal oxytocin at this dose to over 300 research participants to date, including distressed couples with AUD and intimate partner violence, without a single adverse event reported.  Participants  will be informed about  the potential  side 
effects  of oxytocin and will be closely  monitored  by [CONTACT_827]. Oxytocin self -administration  
will occur only in the context of the study visit with clear instruction from the study staff, who are equipped 
with ready access to clinicians and emergency care if necessary.  All participants will be given clear 
instructions on when and where to administer the study medication (only during the study visit, while study staff are monitoring). The study medication will be stored in under refrigeration before and after medication administration (either at the participant’s home or at the study site).  
All telehealth participants complete a participant locator form with study staff, that allows the study team to identify local emergency care facilities and contact [CONTACT_3031]. Specifically, for out of state or remote participants, the study staff will co mpi[INVESTIGATOR_5829] a list of referrals and emergency contacts to provide to study 
participants ahead of enrollment.  
 Blood Draw:  Participants may experience pain or discomfort, faintness, bruising, or bleeding at the location 
where the blood is drawn . There is also a slight chance of infection  as a result of having blood drawn. 
 Risks of pregnancy: Because this study involves a 50% chance of a study subject receiving active 
medication (i.e., oxytocin) and the effects of oxytocin on pregnancy outcome are well known, pregnant and lactating females will be excluded from the trial. We will instruct fema le participants to use appropriate 
forms of contraception, and participants are required to complete pregnancy tests at baseline and weekly during treatment.   Risks related to neuroimaging:  Participants will be asked to complete two  optional neuroimaging scans 
(functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI), which will be conducted at the MUSC Center for Biomedical Imaging (CBI), which is located on the MUSC campus. T here are very few potential risks from 
fMRI itself. There is no exposure to ionizing radiation and the machine and scanning sequences and gradients are approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for routine clinical use. Individuals who are claustrophobic may experience some anxiety during the scanning procedures. Participants may experience some loud noises during the scanning procedure and there is a mild risk of hearing damage if patients are not given hearing protection. All participants in the study will be given hearing protection. Participants may experience psychological discomfort from undergoing the scanning procedure, such as boredom and fatigue.  Ferrous objects in the body that are undetected could move during scans. This could lead to tissue damage and hemorrhage . These risks are outlined in the informed consent document. In our 
past and ongoing studies utilizing fMRI, we have been able to safely complete imaging procedures without undue distress or negative outcomes. This includes research with civilians and Veterans who have current AUD.  
 Confidentiality: All possible efforts to protect participants’ privacy and confidentially will be made 
throughout the course of the study. Participants will be provided with a written informed consent document which specifies the risks and confidentiality protections and limits of study procedures.  
V18 3.8.[ADDRESS_737051]  and social media  to reach participants in South Carolina and in other states inside 
the continental [LOCATION_002] . The screening  measure contains  questions directly  pertaining  to the study’s  
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Participants  who meet  eligibility  criteria  will be scheduled  with research  
staff for a baseline assessment  session.  In a private room,  participants  will be provided  with a 
description  of the nature  and requirements  of study  participation,  and asked  to read and sign an IRB-
approved consent form prior to beginning any study procedures.  Informed  consent  will be collected  by 
[CONTACT_408], trained research assistants, PI, or Co- Is. All study personnel will read and attend 
training sessions  in the study protocol conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_560847] -Is. These 
trainings will include t he essential  elements  of ethical  conduct of research  so that each member  of the 
research  staff is well-equipped to provide participants  with adequate information prior  to their  agreeing  
to participate  in the study.   
Participants  will also be informed that they are not required  to make a decision  about whether or 
not they choose to participate  on that day. Although participants will complete  the informed consent 
procedure apart  from  their partner to ensure each partner’s  safety  and confidentiality and to minimize 
coercion,  all participants  will have the opportunity to discuss participation  with their partner prior to 
providing informed consent. Participants who are eligible to participate and choose to do so will be encouraged to ask any questions they might have about the study. Both the participant and research staff member will sign the form.  
The informed consent document will outline 1) the sponsorship of the study; 2) the nature, purpose 
and procedures of the research study; 3) the voluntary nature of participation (i.e., participation is not required and can be discontinued at any time; 4) duration of the study; 5) potential risks and discomforts and potential benefits of participating; 6) that all information will be kept confidential subject to the provisions of state and federal law; 7) compensation; 8) alternative treatments ; and 9) teleh ealth procedures and 
limitations . Participants will be informed that they can discontinue participation in the study at any time and 
that this decision will not influence the care they receive at any MUSC or VAMC clinic.  
 Assessment Procedures . Some participants may experience distress in response to self -report and interview 
measures pertaining to AUD symptoms or associated areas of functioning such as relationship problems or depression. Participants may also experience physical or psychological discomfort during the neuroimaging procedures or medication self -administration. However, based on the research team’s past experience and 
available literature the risks involved in the proposed project are minimal and manageable. Nevertheless, we have a specific protocol in place to manage participant distress in the event that it arises. This protocol is discussed in more detail below. Additionally, all participants will receive an evidence -based behavioral 
intervention (e.g., ABCT) that includes techniques to help reduce distress and anxiety, and improve mood (e.g., communication skills, cognitive restructuring). We will also inform participants during the informed consent process that they may terminate any assessments, study procedures, or therapy sessions  at any point. 
Our past and ongoing research suggests that the measures and methods proposed in this study can be implemented without undue psychological distress or exacerbation of symptoms. This experience includes numerous federally -funded projects with civilians and Veterans with AUD.  
In the event that a participant becomes distressed secondary to participation, they will be encouraged 
to contact [CONTACT_978]. In addition, they will have access to urgent care services at MUSC and VAMC treatment clinics , as well as the VA Crisis Line . Telehealth participants not located in Charleston will be provided 
with urgent care contact [CONTACT_560891].  Any adverse effects noted by [CONTACT_560892], who will then report these adverse effects in writing  to the IRB and NIH 
per protocol (see the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan at the end of this section for more details). The research team includes several licensed clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who are equipped to help 
V18 3.8.[ADDRESS_737052] information for their local mental 
health clinicians, urgent care, and national suicide prevention lifeline for their use should suicidal ideation occur outside of weekly therapy sessions. Should a suicide safety plan be needed based on participant’s BDI during either baseline or weekly visits , participants will meet with study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560848].  
A note on VA Crisis Line: the VA Crisis Line can be reached at any time from any location. Study teams have been trained on how to connect a veteran with the VA Crisis Line via three -way teleconferencing. 
Once the VA Crisis Line is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], they will dis patch necessary care to the veteran in crisis anywhere in 
the [LOCATION_002], and provide follow up services.    Study Physician. Kathleen Brady, M.D., Ph.D. will serve as the Study Physician on this project. [CONTACT_335437] 
has extensive experience with NIH -sponsored clinical trials involving individuals with AUD and other 
substance use disorders, as well as comorbid psychiatric conditions. She has ample experience monitoring and treating individuals with acute substance -related withdrawal. She will review all adverse events, 
unanticipated problems involving risk to participants or others, serious adverse events, and any participant deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event within 10 calendar days. In addition, the investigative team includes psychologists with ample addiction expertise (Drs. Flanagan, Back, Bottonari) who will closely monitor study participants. If at any point a participant necessitates medical management, psychiatric consultation or psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], they will be evaluated and referral to treatment will be provided accordingly. If a participant becomes suicidal, emergency psychiatric assessment will be arranged. The participant will be closely monitored until they are no longer suicidal or an appropriate care plan is in place.  Alcohol Withdrawal. Participants will be screened for acute alcohol withdrawal at the outset of the study. 
Participants reporting CIWA-Ar scores >[ADDRESS_737053] the confidentiality of participants’ data, except in the event of imminent risk to self or others, or in the event of disclosure of child or elder abuse. In the event that confidentiality must be broken to protect the safety of participants or others, only the data essential to make an adequate report to authori ties will be disclosed. All 
participants will review the IRB -approved informed consent document with research staff in a private room 
separate from their partner. Through this process, research staff will inform all research participants of the risks of participation, including emotional distress. In the event that a participant experiences substantial distress or reports risk of harm to oneself or others, they will be asked to complete a safety plan. The Mobile Crisis Unit of Charleston County and urgent c are services on the MUSC campus are additional resources 
available to study staff and research participants. Risks of participation will be outlined in the informed 
V18 3.8.[ADDRESS_737054] study staff will be required to complete the CBI’s MRI safety training class. The 
course is taught by [CONTACT_560893]. The staff will be trained about safety in the MRI environment, and how to screen oneself and others. The staff will also have knowledge of safety procedures for entering the scanner facility, safely removing participants from the scanner, when and how to quench the magnet and basic emergency procedures including emergency contact [CONTACT_3031]. Standard operating procedures for emergency situations are located on- site. The MRI 
technician and [CONTACT_98702] (Co- I) are authorized to operate the equipment and will be present throughout 
the scanning sessions.  Although there are no known risks of MRI scanning to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_560849] 3.0 T, the possibility that risks could be discovered in the future cannot be ignored. Therefore, urine pregnancy tests will be used to exclude pregnant women from study participation.  A careful metal screening history will be taken from each participant to assess the possibility of metal devices/implants and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], MRI technician and/or clinical staff who have had extensive training and experience with MRI safety. If the screening yields information that raises a question of safety, the participant will be asked to provide the appropriate documentation (i.e., film) before they are allowed to participate. In addition, participants will be asked to empty their pockets and wi ll be screened with a hand -held ferromagnetic -
detector wand. Participants will wear earplugs and sound- dampening headphones to decrease the intensity 
of the scanner noise.  Prior exposure to pi[INVESTIGATOR_217167], getting into the scanner, and seeing others in the scanner, often reduces psychological discomfort or identifies people for whom scanning is not appropriate.   Safety and Monitoring Plan. A procedure for clinical deterioration has been established based upon our 
experience with previous and ongoing NIH- funded clinical trials. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (who will be trained Master’s 
or Doctoral level clinicians) will be instructed to use their best clinic al judgment regarding emergencies and 
inform the PI [INVESTIGATOR_91394]. In addition to relying on clinical judgment on the part of the treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560850], we will also monitor alcohol and drug use, depression, 
and relationship functioning weekly using standardized measures (TLFB, BDI -II, DAS -7, 
breathalyzer /saliva alcohol  tests) in order to detect any symptom worsening requiring further evaluation. 
Additionally, participants will be advised to observe any signs of worsening alcohol use, depression symptoms, or relationship functioning including intimate partner violence, and to discuss these challenges with their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
Participants will be withdrawn from the study and referred for more intensive treatment if: (1) there 
are increases in alcohol use leading to the need for a more intensive level of care (i.e., medical detoxification, inpatient or partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]); (2) there is active suicidal or homicidal ideation and/or intent; (3) there is an inability to manage the participant psychiatrically within the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study (i.e., need for the initiation of psychotropic medications; development of psychosis); or (4) there is an inability to complete ABCT therapy appointments due to incarceration or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
There is a well -established protocol at MUSC for emergency psychiatric evaluation, crisis 
intervention and/or psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_169418], homicidal, psychotic or other acutely distressed participants. Immediately on detection of these needs, the assessor/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560851] a psychiatrist to review the participant's situation. If appropriate, the psychiatrist will personally evaluate the participant. Alternatively, during weekdays, the participant will be escorted by a study staff member to the psychiatric walk -in clinic or emergency room. Psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335385].  
Participants will be informed during informed consent procedures of the standard limitations of 
confidentiality such as imminent risk of harm to self or others, or child or elder abuse. Participants will be informed that they can decide not to answer any questions and, should they become distressed or are uncomfortable with continuing to participate, they may discontinue participation at any time without penalty. The compensation schedule will be stated verbally and in writing in the initial study descripti on 
V18 3.8.22 
 Page 21 of 29   and the informed consent procedure. The participant’s copy of the consent form will provide contact [CONTACT_560894] [INVESTIGATOR_347160] a participant have any questions, comments, or concerns about their participation. Participants will have the opportunity to have a copy of the consent form mailed to them at any time.  
 Suicide Specific Risk Identification and Response Plan. Specific precautions will be taken to prevent harm 
to participants and potential participants. Project therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560852]. Flanagan (PI) and [CONTACT_235926] (Co -I), who are licensed clin ical 
psychologists. All project therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560853], including ideation, plan, and intent as well as history of ideation or attempts, and they will be trained to develop a safety plan  with participants. In initial screening procedures, participants identified by [CONTACT_560895], but will be offered emergency psychiatric care immediately. This care is available 24 hours per day  at MUSC and the Charleston VAMC, 
as indicated above. Moreover, during the course of the study, any participant scoring above 25 on the BDI -

Thus, all assessment points represent suicide risk identification, assessment, and intervention opportunities. Study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_560855], and will receive specific instruction of suicide risk assessment during the initial training workshop. In the 
case of acutely suicidal or distressed veterans participating via telehealth and located outside of our immediate geographical location (and the state of South Carolina),the study team will initiate a three -way 
call with the VA Veteran Crisis Line w ho has the ability to locate the veteran and send emergency help to 
the veteran.  
 Study Implementation and Data Security. We will take careful precautions to maintain confidentiality for 
all participants, using procedures we have used with similar previous studies: All research personnel will attend a required in- service training conducted by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_560856], informe d consent, and assessment 
protocols will be described. All members of the research team will sign a confidentiality agreement that no identifying information of specific individuals will appear in any external documents (e.g., peer -reviewed 
publications, presentations) or in any internal reports.  
All study data related to psychological outcomes (i.e., the participant responses to questionnaires) 
and demographics will not have any unique identifying data attached in any way. All participants will be assigned a numerical study identifier to minimize the potential to link identifying information with study data. One master list of study participants will be kept separate from all other study data. The master list will be destroyed upon study completion; it will be kept separate from all data and will be available only to the PI, Study Coordinator, and research assistants. To protect participant confidentiality, all data will be maintained in a manner consistent with IRB -approved protocol. Data will be stored in locked filing cabinets 
within a locked office and on MUSC’s encrypted computers and data servers. Access to de -identified study 
data will be limited to named project investigators, the Study Coordinator, NIH audit personnel, MUSC IRB audit personnel, and the VAMC Office of Research & Development (R&D) personnel. Data will be maintained per an IRB -approved protocol. 
The study protocol and safety plan will be printed and kept in a central location within the research 
space for easy access for all research staff. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the management of any participant or study- related emergency will be established and research staff will be trained on these 
protocols . At least two members of the study team will be present during all participant appointments in 
order to ensure the safety of participants and research staff. Appointments will be scheduled primarily 
during normal working hours, however accommodations will be made to fit participants’ schedules.  
V18 3.8.[ADDRESS_737056] of research and the 
protection of human research participants will be  completed on an annual basis, in compliance with MUSC 
institutional and NIH regulations.  
 
15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
            While there is no guarantee of specific benefit to participants in this study, the potential benefits include a thorough psychological and substance use assessment, referral to appropriate treatment services and community resources, and remuner ation. Participants may also benefit from receiving access to an 
evidence -based behavioral treatment which may result in a reduction in aversive AUD symptom severity, 
improvement in relationship functioning and symptoms of other mental health problems (e.g., depression) and improvements in other areas of functioning (e.g., sleep, quality of life). Other study benefits include regular contact [CONTACT_126790], access to assessment information pertaining to mental health, substance abuse, etc., and referral to treatments for associated problems such as smoking. While these benefits may be considered minimal, we believe that they outweigh the minimal risk and burden incurred by [CONTACT_4317]. Participants will also enroll in a study that has the potential to enhance treatment for other patients and families with AUD.  
 
16.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects 
Study data will not be shared with participants to maintain confidentiality.  
 
17.0 Drugs or Devices  
The IND for oxytocin’s use in this study is held by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Flanagan . Oxytocin will be compounded, stored, 
and dispensed by [CONTACT_8021] (IDS) on the MUSC campus or Pi[INVESTIGATOR_560857]. Pleasant, SC . Pi[INVESTIGATOR_560858] a compounding pharmacy used by [CONTACT_560896], including others within our group. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_560859] a member of The  International  
Academy  of Compounding Pharmacists  (IACP). IACP is an international, non-profit association 
protecting and promoting the art and skill of pharmaceutical compounding.   
Anjinetta Johnson, PA or Jennifer Jones, MD will send participants’ prescriptions to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_560860]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_560861] 
(oxytocin or placebo), but this information will remain blinded to the research staff and to the participants. 
Research staff will pi[INVESTIGATOR_560862] (using a cooler bag with an ice pack to maintain refrigeration). Research staff will 
administer the study drug to part icipants in our Charleston Center offices. Research staff will select the 
prescribed medication for each individual participant, will confirm the identity of the participant, and will instruct participants on the correct method of administration to achieve the desired dose and will observe participants’ self -administration. Participants will blow their nose, exhale through their nose, then spray 
into one nostril while inhaling, alternating nostrils until the 40 IU dose is achieved.

Amendment 01 20-Sep- 2011The follow ing amendment was developed to incorporate two key changes 
including:
1) Changing the statistical design of the trial to allow comparison to historical 
external controls. Specifically, the 3 -year event free survival (EFS) of 
dasatinib plus chemotherapy will be compared to the 3 -year EFS of 
chemotherapy alone from the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Pediatrica -
Berlin -Frankfurt -Muenster ALL
2000 (AIEOP BFM 2000) trial and the [ADDRESS_395541] induction 
treatment of Philadelphia positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
(EsPhALL). This analysis will improve the ability to interpret the safety and 
efficacy of dasatinib added to che motherapy among
other treatment options for this pediatric leukemia.
2) Incorporating additional supportive care options for chemotherapy to 
accommodate the standard of care at sites in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]).
Additionally, typographical errors w ere also corrected.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA180372
Title of Study: A Phase [ADDRESS_395543](s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Dasatinib 60 mg/m2orally, once daily, for 2 years
Study Phase: 2
Research Hypothesis: Dasatinib added to chemotherapy will demonstrate a superior 3-year event free survival 
(EFS) rate compared to chemotherapy alone in the external historical control trial Associazione Italiana di 
Ematologia Pedia trica -Berlin -Frankfurt -Muenster ALL 2000 (AIEOP -BFM 2000) and non-inferior 3-year EFS 
compared to continuous imatinib added to chemotherapy in the external historical control trial of the amended 
European intergroup Study on post induction treatment of Philadelphia positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
(EsPhALL).
Prim ary Objective: Com pare the 3-year event -free survival (EFS) with the external historical controls of the 
AIEOP -BFM 2000 and EsPhALL trials .
Study Design: Children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL will be eligible for this open -label, 
single -arm study and will receive dasatinib added to successive blocks of standard multiagent chemotherapy 
(AIEOP -BFM ALL 2000 regimen) for a maximum duration of 2 years. 
Design :After diagnosis ofacute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), subjects will begin standard induction 
chemotherapy (Block IA).Since the diagnosis of ALL typi[INVESTIGATOR_320436] 
10-14days to determine which patients have Philadelphia chromosome posit ive (Ph+) ALL , frontline induction 
chemotherapy (Block IA) will start prior to enrollment in this trial (approximately 2 weeks) and will be based upon 
the investigator’s institutional standard of care. Enrollment on this study will occur prior to day 15 of Induction 
Block IA.  At day 15, d asatinib treatment shall begin and continue without planned interruption until the com pletion 
of therapy (102 weeks). The components of treatment are divided into blocks as follows: Induction IA (4-5 weeks), 
induction IB (28 days, 4 weeks), recovery period (2-4 weeks), consolidation blocks 1, 2, and 3 (21 days, 3 weeks 
each), reinduction block 1, including phase IIa and IIb (63 days, 9 weeks), interim maintenance (29 days, 4 weeks, 
overlaps 2 w eeks with end of reinduction block 1), reinduction block 2 (63 days, 9 weeks), and continuation therapy 
(62 weeks). Chemotherapeutic agents utilized in this regimen include: cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 
6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, leucovorin, dexamethasone, vincristine, asparagi nase, hydrocortisone, 
daunorubicin, ifosfamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, and thioguanine. 
Subjects who meet pre-defined criteria mayreceive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The use of 
dasatinib after transplantation is optional in all HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], at the discretion of the treating physician. Subjects 
may receive [ADDRESS_395544] dasatinib.   Subjects with CNS3 disease at diagnosis will receive 
cranial irradiation during the Interim Maintenance period.
The total duration of the trial to determine the primary and secondary endpoints will be approximately 6 years.

Study Assessments and Primary Endpoint: Event Free Survival (EFS) is defin ed as thetime from first dasatinib
treatment until one of the follow ing events: lack of complete response (induction and consolidation failure), relapse 
at any site, development of second malignant neoplasm, or death.   
External Data Safety Mon itoring Board: An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board will provide 
oversight of trial to ensure protection of the research participants.
Statistical Methods: The samp le size comprises at least 75 treated subjects. A minimum of 20 treated subjects will 
be dis tributed in each of the age ranges of 1 - 11 years and 12 < 18years, respectively. 
The primary analysis will compare the 3-year EFS of dasatinib plus chemotherapy with external historical controls 
in hierarchical order.  The trial will be considered positive if at least the first two comparisons are statisticall y 
significant. The comparisons will be as follows:
1)Superiority over chemotherapy alone of AIEOP -BFM 2000
2)Non-inferiority to continuous imatinib plus chemotherapy of the amended EsPhALL trial
3)Superi ority over continuous imatinib plus chemotherapy of the amended EsPhALL trial
For the analysis of the primary endpoints, a hierarchical testing procedure will be used so that the overall 
experiment -wise one -sided type I error rate is preserved at 0.05. 
The differences in 3-year EFS rates will be computed using binomial proportions.  The differences in event rates 
along with exact 2-sided 90% Clopper -Pearson CI’s will be provided. Test for difference in event rates will be 
carried out using a two-sided 2test. Non-inferiority testing against the study treatment in the amended EsPhALL 
trial will be carried out using the corresponding 2-sided 90% CI for the treatment difference and comparing the 
lower confidence limit to the non-inferiority margin of -5%. This margin corresponds to 1/[ADDRESS_395547] size of 
18% anticipated in the amended EsPhALL trial over the chem otherapy -only control of the original EsPhALL trial. 
All of the above tests will be performed at the 0.05 (one- sided) significance level. 
Secondar y endpoints include safety and feasibility of dasatinib added to chemotherapy, an estimate of theEFS of 
dasatinib added to chemotherapy (including 3 and 5-year rates) , complete remission rates at end of induction
compared with AIEOP BFM 2000 and the Amend ed EsPhALL trials ,minimal residual disease levels by [CONTACT_320484] T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and BCR -ABL mutation status at baseline and time of 
progression or relapse. Adverse events and laboratory results will be graded utilizing the National Cancer 
Institute -Comm on Terminology Criteria (NCI -CTCAE) Version 4.

two comparisons are statistically  significant. The comparisons will be as follows:
1)Superiority  over chemotherap y alone of AIEOP -BFM 2000
2)Non-inferiorit y to continuous imatinib plus c hemotherap y of the amended EsPhALL trial
3)Superiority  over continuous imatinib plus chemotherapy  of the amended EsPhALL trial
1.3.2 Secondary Objectives
The key  secondary  objectives are to determine: 
1.The safet y and feasibility of dasatinib added to standard che motherapy  
2.Estimate the EFS of dasatinib plus chemotherap y (including 3 and 5 -year rates)
3.Complete remission rates (< 5% blasts in bone marrow and no peripheral blasts) at end of 
induction compared with AIEOP BFM 2000 and the Amen ded EsPhALL trials 
Other secondary  objectives are to estimate:
1.The difference in 3-year EFS rate with the 3-year EFS rate of available historical controls 
such as the COG AALL0 [ADDRESS_395557] levels (defined b y PCR detection of clone- specific immunoglobulin and T -cell receptor 
gene rearrangements)
3.BCR -ABL mutation status at baseline and time of disease progression or relapse

3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
Children and adolescents with newly  diagnosed Ph+ ALL will be eligible for this open -label, 
single -arm study  and will receive dasatinib added to successive blocks of standard multiagent 
chemotherap y (AIEOP -BFM ALL 2000 regimen)15for a maximum duration of 2years. The 
study  sample size is at least 75 treated patients. 
Design
After diagnosis of acute ly mphoblastic leukemia (ALL) via cy togenetics, FISH or PCR (via local 
laboratory ), subjects will begin standard induction chemotherapy  (Block IA). Since the dia gnosis 
of ALL typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y requires urgent treatment and it takes up to 10-[ADDRESS_395561] Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL, frontline induction chemotherap y 
(Block IA) will start prior to enrollment in this trial (approxima tely 2 weeks) and will be based 
upon the investigator’s institutional standard of care. Enrollment on this study  will occur prior to 
day 15 of Induction Block IA.At day 15, dasatinib treatment shall begin and continue without 
planned interruption until the completion of therapy (102 weeks). 
Subjects who meet pre-defined criteria at specific time points in treatment may receive a 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Subjects will have the option to receive [ADDRESS_395562] dasatinib (not mandatory ).Subjects with CNS3 disease at diagnosis will 
receive cranial irradiation during the Interim Maintenance period. 
A schematic of the study  design is shown in Figure 3.1.

be following the consolidation block 3 (HR3). Subjects should continue on protocol specified 
chemotherap y until HSCT. If alternative chemotherapy  is preferred, the subject must be 
discontinued from the study  treatment but must continue to be followed per protocol for the long 
term growth assessments. If a subject goes off-treatment to receive a different chemotherap y, 
dasatinib will no longer be provided via this study. Subject swho do not meet the HSCT criteria 
are not recommended to receive HSCT. During the HSCT, subjects will not receive dasatinib. 
Following adequate engraftment of the HSCT, the use of dasatinib is optional at the discretion of 
the treating investigator. Subjects may receive [ADDRESS_395564] dasatinib S ee 
section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional details. Criteria for HSCT eligibility  will be based on MRD 
response at key early timepoints in therap y.MRD will be assessed by [CONTACT_284340] (RQ- PCR) of rearranged immunoglobulin/T -cell receptor genes according to 
standardized criteria46.For subjects with uninformative PCR for Ig/TCR gene rearrangement 
known at baseline, RQ-PCR for BCR -ABL  fusion transcripts orflow cytometry will be 
substituted (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Key criteria for HSCT include:
1)MRD at end of IB/start of consolidation block 1 (HR1) ≥ 0.05% (5 x 10-4) as 
measured b y Ig/TCR PCR
a.For subjects that do not have informative results of Ig/TCR PCR, see

10-4)*as measured by [CONTACT_106633]/TCR PCR and MRD at end of consolidation block 3 
(HR3)/start of reinduction block 1remains positive at any detectable level (providing 
the assay  limit is at least 0.1%).
*This includes if MRD at end of IB is positive but less than the quantifiable 
range (POS<QR) with QR not at least 0.005% (5 x 10-5)
a.For subjects that do not have informative results of Ig/TCR PCR, see section 
[IP_ADDRESS].
Subjects with CNS3 disease at diagnosis will receive cranial irradiation during the Interim 
Maintenance period. Subjects with testicular involvement with Ph+ ALL will not be eligible for 
this trial as testicular radiation will not be part of the therap y (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Duration
The total duration of the trial will be approximately  6 years and includes an estimated 
recruitment period of 3 years and a minimum follow -up of 3 years for the primary  and secondary 
endpoints. The 3 year recruitment period is based upon the average historical accrual rates in the 
pediatric Ph+ ALL population13,47,48. Three years of additional follow -up would ensure that all 
subjects have sufficient follow -up to assess the primary  and secondary  endpoints. Subjects 
recruited near the beginning of the accrual period would have up to [ADDRESS_395565] 3 years of follow -up. Subjects who

3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Treatments:
Prohibited treatments should not be used concomitantly  with trial therapy  and will constitute a 
relevant protocol deviation as one t hat can have a major impact on the interpretation of the trial. 
No other therap y for the treatment of Ph+ ALL other than the AIEOP -BFM ALL [ADDRESS_395573] (including preparative regimen) anddasatinib are allowed during 
the treatment phase of the trial. Subjects in follow -up after treatment discontinuation may  receive 
additional treatment for relapsed ALL as medically indicated.
Medications associated with QT interval prolongation are prohibited. Please refer to the 
Appendix 3for a websit e of “Drugs with Risk of Torsades de Points.” This list includes:
quinidine, procainamide, disopy ramide
amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide
erythromy cins, clarithromy cin, azithromy cin
chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]
cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine, 
levomethad yl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Restricted Treatments:
Restricted medications should be limited as concomitant medications during protocol therapy . 
These medications may create drug-drug interactions. These medications are allowed but must 
be prescribed with caution and with careful management of potential drug -drug interactions. Use 
of restricted medications will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Caution should be exercised if subjects are required to take medications that inhibit platelet 
function or anticoagulants. Antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants should be avoided in the setting 
of Grade [ADDRESS_395574] of medications known to prolong the QT interval is found in 
Appendix 3. While “Drugs with Risk of Torsades de Points” are prohibited, “Drugs with a 
Possible Risk or Conditional Risk of Torsades de Points” may  be given concomitantly  should the 
investigator believe that beginning therapy  with a potentially  QT prolonging medication (other 
than the ones explicitly  prohibited) is vital to an individual subject’s care. Additional ECG(s) 
will be done at the investigator’s discretion to ensure the subjec t’s safety . If such a medication is 
considered important to a subject’s care, the situation should be discussed with the Study 
Director.

these medications could be increased while receiving dasatinib49. 
Additionally  strong to moderate CYP3A 4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
erythromy cin, clarithromy cin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromy cin) may significantly  increase concentrations of dasatinib and should be used with 
caution when administered concurrentl y with dasatinib. Strong to moderate CYP3A4 inducers
(eg, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]) may decrease the concentration of dasatinib and should be used with caution 
when administered concurrentl y with dasatinib. See Appendix 5and 6for a list of CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers respectively .
Dasatinib may have decreased solubility  and absorption at pH > 4. Subjects should avoid 
concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists. In a  population of 13 subjects, 
Cmax and AUC were reduced by 42% and 46%, respectivel y when a single dose of dasatinib 
[ADDRESS_395576] (egduring high dose 
corticosteroid administration), they may be used. However, based upon the high interpatient 
variability  of dasatinib pharmacokinetics, some subjects may  have a reduction and so me subjects 
may have no reduction in the plasma concentration of dasatinib when concomitantly  taken with 
these agents. Short -acting antacid agents (egaluminum or magnesium hydroxide) may be 
administered without affecting dasatinib pharmacokinetics, but not within [ADDRESS_395577] (and noninvestigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for an y of the following reasons:
Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any  reason)
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormality  or intercurrent illness which, in the

The summary  of the treatment plan is shown below in Figure 4.3and Table 4.3A . Subjects will 
receive up to 24 months of treatment during this trial. Since subjects with Ph+ ALL often 
experience delay s in treatment due to toxicities associated with therapy , delay s in starting 
treatment blocks are expected. Therefore, all start dates for the initiation of all treatment blocks 
are estimates, and should not be considered as strict requirements.
As patients newl y diagnosed with Ph+ ALL require urgent treatment, initial therapy  for their 
disease will start outside the protocol with a chemotherap y regimen that is standard at the 
investigative center (referred to as induction therapy  IA). Dasatinib (IMP) at a dose of 60 mg/m2
once daily will be introduced on day +15 from initiation of treatment or no later than when the 
day 15 induction chemotherap y is administered in all subjects in addition to ongoing 
chemotherap y (approximately  until day +29 to 33). From the start of induction therap y IB, all 
subjects will follow the same treatment plan shown in Table 4.3A . A key for abbreviations is 
found at the end of the table. If commercial shortages of protocol specified chemotherap y agents

4.3.1 Full Treatment Plan
[IP_ADDRESS] Induction Therapy Phase IA
All patients will receive the first induction according to the institutional standard of care. See 
Appendix 11for example sof induction phase IA regimens .
Dasatinib 60 mg/m2daily  will be introduced on day  15 from the start of induction IA, or no later 
than when the day 15 chemotherap y is administered to accommodate any delay s for toxicity  or 
scheduling/logistics. Dasatinib will begiven continuously  until the end of therap y(2 years).
Dasatinib should only be interrupted for toxicity .Induction IA will last approximately  [ADDRESS_395587] 5mg dose. The dasatinib dose will be recalculated based on BSA every  12 weeks, or 
more often if necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Induction Therapy Phase IB
Pneumocy stis (jirovecii) pneumonia (PCP) proph ylaxis is recommended with 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cotrimoxazole or other appropriate agent against Pneumocy stis 
jirovecii according to the institutional standard of care. Note that pentamidine use is prohibited in 
this trial due to potential interaction wi th dasatinib (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] )

SUPPORTIVE CARE : The 3 High Risk Consolidation blocks are profoundly  myelosuppressive 
and also include 5 days of high dose dexamethasone, which can blunt clinical signs of infection :
therefore the following precautions are to be taken for all subjects during each High Risk block: 
Mandatory  blood counts with differential every  2 days after completion of chemotherap y 
until there is evidence of marrow recovery .These blocks are highly  myelosuppressive.
Recovery  is defined as ANC > 0.2 x109/L (200/ µl) and platelet transfusion independence.
Mandatory  myeloid growth factor support: G-CSF 5µg/kg/day  s.c. or i.v. starting anytime 
from 7 to 11 day s the from the start of the block (eg, at least 24 hours after completion of the 
chemotherap y in each HR block), until the WBC count is > 3.0 x109/L (>3000/mm3). The 
option of pegfilgrastim 100µg/kg s.c. given once during the 7-11th day from the start of the 
block may be considered as an alternative. Myeloid growth factor support is routinely  
included in these blocks in BFM and EsPhALL trials.
Although not required, STRONGL Y consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320442] y, particularl y during the period of profound 
myelosuppression, until there is evidence of blood count recovery  because this is the 
intervention most likely  to reduce the death rate.  
Because clinical signs of infection can be blunted following high dose dexamethasone 
therap y, a very low threshold should be used for institution of empi[INVESTIGATOR_320443] y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Consolidation Block 2 (HR2)
Consolidation therapy  will begin 21 days after the start of HR1, provided the patient is in good 
general condition and adequate ANC (500/l; 0.5 x 109/L) and platelet counts (50,000/l;

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in whic h the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109382] g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.)

Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, any organism, virus or infectious particl e, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study  drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, and cancer are not alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these 
events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or event life 
threatening)

routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline /trending of health status 
(eg,routine colono scopy)
medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remed ying ill health state and was 
planned prior to entry  into the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative).
6.1.[ADDRESS_395639]’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 5 half lives of dasatinib ( ie24 hours) of discontinuation of dosing. If applicable, 
SAEs must be collected that relate to any  later protocol- specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin 
biopsy ).
The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be 
related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness . 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related tostudy  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therap y, or a complication of a study  
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.

immediately , only  in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper 
forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): See Contact [CONTACT_211043].
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same invest igator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS

AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. As noted in section 
[IP_ADDRESS], AEs do not need to be reported for subjects going on to HSCT unless considered related 
to the investigational product.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serio us (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug, or those that are present at the end of study  
treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the 
nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.

Related - There is a reasonable causal relationship to study  drug administration and the AE. 
Not Related -There is not a reasonable causal relationship to study  drug administration and

The expression "reasonable causal rela tionship" is meant to convey  in general that there are facts 
(eg evidence such as de-challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a positive causal 
relationship.

SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
Any laboratory  abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug discontinued or

The primary  analysis will compare the 3-year EFS rate of dasatinib plus chemotherap y with the 
following historical controls:
1. 3- year EFS rate of chemotherap y alone from the AIEOP -BFM 2000 trial
2. 3- year EFS rate of continuous imatinib added to chemotherap y from the amended 
EsPhALL trial.

Criteria for Response in Bone marrow (BM) are: 
M1: < 5% ly mphoblasts (Complete Response in BM)
M2: 5 -25% ly mphoblasts
M3: > 25% ly mphoblasts
For the primary  analysis, complete response (CR) in the bone marrow will be assessed between 
the start of dasatinib and completion of consoli dation block 3 (HR3)/start of first reinduction 
(Protocol II).Those subjects who reach CR within this window will be considered at risk for 
relapse or death without relapse.
Those who do not reach CR (ie,M1 bone marrow) between the start of dasatinib and the last day 
of consolidation block HR3/start of first reinduction (Protocol II)will be considered as an event 
(resistant). For subjects who undergo HSCT, the date of the HSCT will not be considered as an 
event. These subjects will continue to be followe d for an event during and after HSCT.
The primary  analysis will be performed once the last subject treated has passed the 3-year 
follow -up period to ensure all subjects have the opportunity  for 3-year EFS assessments.
Subjects without an event and lost to follow -up before their 3-year assessments will not be 
considered as an event in the primary  analysis, however, will be considered an event in the 
sensitivity  analysis.The term “lost to follow -up” should be interpreted as discontinuation from 
the study  resulting in a stop of any  further data collection.
Relapse Criteria for EFS
Relapse is defined as an y recurrence of disease, whether in the marrow or extramedullary  site: 
CNS relapse: Positive cytomorphology  and 5 or more WBC/µL in CSF, or any  signs of CNS 
leukemia such a facial nerve pals y, brain/eye involvement, or h ypothalamic syndrome.
Testicular relapse: Must be documented by [CONTACT_320494] , in the absence of concomitant 
bone marrow or CNS relapse.
Bone marrow relapse: Patients with an M3 marrow (>25 % blasts) after first CR has been 
achieved
Relapse should be histopathologically determined.
All BM samplings, CSF evaluations, physical examinations and death information subsequent to 
achievement of a CR will be utilized to determine relapse, second mal ignancy and death for EFS 
analysis.
Sensitivity  analysis of the primary  endpoint of EFS will include stratification of subjects by  [CONTACT_320495]/standard risk57,58. These risk groups are defined as follows:
Definition of high risk group:   MRD at end of I nduction 1 A0.01%
Definition of low/standard risk: MRD at end of Induction 1A of < 0.01%

8.3.2 Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety and Feasibility
Treatment related mortality  shall define the endpoint of safet y and feasibility . A minimum 
number of treatment related de aths in induction (after day 15) and in continuous complete 
remission (CCR) will be pre-specified in the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. Subjects in CCR are patients who 
reach CR and do not have an event (relapse, death or second malignant neoplasm).
Adverse events and laboratory  results will be graded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Additional laboratory  results that are not graded by [CONTACT_320496] 4.0 will be presented according to the following categories: below normal limits, within 
normal limits, and above normal limits.
[IP_ADDRESS] Event Free Survival (EFS)
The EFS endpoint is also considered for secondary /sensitivity  anal yses, including:
1. HSCT considered as an event if the subject discontinues
2.Lost to follow -up considered as an event (at the dat e of last contact)
3.Induction failures considered as an event at time [ADDRESS_395650] status looking at 3 groups: 
subjects who had HSCT, subjects who were eligible to have HSCT but did not, and 
subjects who were i neligible for HSCT.
5.Using Kaplan -Meier estimates of EFS probabilities (for overall EFS estimation including 
the 3- year and 5- year Kaplan -Meier estimates)
6.Stratified by  [CONTACT_320497]/standard risk (as defined in Section 8.3.1 )
7.Comparing 3-year EFS with results in COG AALL0031 (with alignment of EFS 
definition)
[IP_ADDRESS] Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)
The MRD levels are the proportion of leukemic cells in a sample at a specific time point. The 
method of reference is the quan titative PCR detection of clone-specific immunoglobulin and 
T-cell receptor gene rearrangements (Ig/TCR). The limit of detection of this assay  will be 
approximately  10-4- 10-5or 0.01% -0.001%.
PCR for BCR -ABL  will be expressed as a ratio of BCR -ABL transcripts compared to a control 
gene (eg ABL) with log reduction compared to baseline . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete Remission Rate
Complete remission will be defined as <5% lymphoblasts in the bone marrow (ie,M1 bone 
marrow) and CSF with no evidence of other extra medullary disease.

[IP_ADDRESS] Event Free Survival (EFS)
Comparis on of [ADDRESS_395651] 
two comparisons are statistically  significant. The comparisons will be as follows:

Date: 28-Oct-[ADDRESS_395652] the opportunity  to be 
followed for 3 years prior to the analy sis and the denominator will include all treated /evaluable
subjects.
The differences in event rates along with exact 2-sided 90% Clopper -Pearson CI’s will be 
provided. Test for difference in event rates will be carried out using a two-sided χ2test. 
Non-inferiorit y testing against the study  treatment in the amended EsPhALL trial will be carried 
out using the corresponding 2-sided 90% CI for the treatment difference and comparing the 
lower confidence limit to the non-inferiority  margin of -5%. This margin corresponds to 1/[ADDRESS_395653] size of 18% anticipated in the amended EsPhALL  trial over the chemotherap y-onl y 
control of the original EsPhALL trial.
All of the above tests will be performed at the 0.05 (one-sided) significance level. Anal yses will 
be conducted in the treated population (ie, subjects enrolled but never treated with study  drug 
will not be part of the co -primary  endpoints).
The difference in 3 -year EFS rate with the 3- year EFS rate of available historical controls such as 
COG AALL0031 will be computed using binomial proportions as a secondary  objective. When 
comparing with these controls, the definition of event in EFS may be modified in order to align 
the endpoints for a relevant comparison.
Overall EFS
Overall estimation of EFS is one of the key secondary  endpi[INVESTIGATOR_320459]. Overall estimation of theEFS 
of dasatinib plus chemothera py will be performed utilizing the Kaplan -Meier (KM) Product 
Limit method. The medians will be provided with their 2-sided 95% CI computed using the 
method of Brookmey er and Crowley .The 3 -year and 5 -year EFS rates will be computed with the 
corresponding 95% CI's using Greenwood's formula for computing the standard error will be 
provided. Anal yses of EFS will include KM plots with number of patients at risk.

Comparison Between MRD Methods
Concordance tables between the reference test(Ig/TCR) and each of the [ADDRESS_395657] time points and for 3 different thresholds (0.1 %, 0.01 %, no 
leukemia cells detected). 
McNemar tests will be done on 2 x 2 tables (subjects with <0.1% vs. subjects with 0.1%; 
subjects with < 0.01% vs. subjects with  0.01%; subjects with no cells detected vs. subjects with 
cells detected).
Kappa coefficients will be computed on 4 x 4 tables (0.1 %; 0.01 - 0.1 %; detecte d with a level 
<0.01%; undetectable).
To describe thecorrelation between the methods, Pearson correlation coefficient and graphical 
methods (Ig/TCR vs. BCR- ABL and Ig/TCR vs. flow cytometry) will be used.

OF LCV RESCUE BASED ON ESPHA LL PRA CTICES
Guidelines for intravenous administration of high dose Methotrexate
Cotrimoxazole should be stopped 7 days before the start of the intravenous infusion and can be 
recommenced 7 day s after.
Prehydration
Time: Start hydration at least 6 hours prior to the commencement of the intravenous 
methotrexate.
Fluid: 4% glucose with 0.18% normal saline. To each 500 mL add 25 mmol of sodium 
bicarbonate and 10 mmol of potassium ch loride.
Infusion rate: 125 mL /m2/h (3 L /m2/day)
NB: Adjust the sodium bicarbonate concentration to maintain the urinary pH between [ADDRESS_395682] 7 has been achieved.
Dose of Methotrexate:
Dilute the methotrexate in an appropriate volume of saline (0.9%). Infuse 500 mg/m2of 
methotrexate over 30 minutes and then 4,500 mg/m [ADDRESS_395683] be stopped.
Hydra tion during Methotrexate infusion:
Fluid: 4% glucose with 0.18% normal saline. To each 500 mL add 25 mmol of sodium 
bicarbonate and 10 mmol of potassium chloride.
Infusion rate: Hydration needs to continue during the 24 hours of methotrexate infusion to 
maintain a combined infusion rate of 125 mL/h. This may beachieved either by [CONTACT_2329] a 
Y extension set or using both lumens of the central venous line.
Post Methotrexate Hydration:
Continue hy dration until Calcium folinate rescue is completed
Fluid: 4% glucos e with 0.18% normal saline. To each 500 mL add 25 mmol of sodium 
bicarbonate and 10 mmol of potassium chloride. Infusion rate: 125 mL /m2/h (3 L /m2/day)
Methotrexate levels: Check plasma methotrexate level at 48 hours after start of the 
methotrexate infusion. If the level is 0.5 micromol/L (< 1 x 10-6 M or 0.227 mg/mL), then do 
not give more than three doses of Calcium folinate (42, 48 and54 hours). If MTX levels at 
48hours are > 0.5 micromol/L , then continue hydration and Calcium folinate rescue every  
6hours until MTX levels are < 0.25 micromol/L  as per nomogram.
Calcium folinate Rescue: 15 mg/m2 intravenously at 42, 48 and 54 hours and subsequently  only  
if the plasma methotrexate level is high (see above). Subsequent doses maybe given orally  if 
necessa ry. Intravenous hy dration is stopped when the last dose of Calcium folinate is given.

APPENDIX 2 HD-MTX INFUSION AND RESCUE GUIDELINES AND FLOW 
CHA RTBASED ON COG PRA CTIC ES
When IT therap y and HD MTX are scheduled for the same day, deliver the IT therap y within 
6hours of the beginning of the IV MTX infusion (hour -6 to +6, with 0 being the start of the 
MTX bolus).
Hold TMP -SMX on the days of HDMTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of the 
HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.4 μM. In the presence of delay ed 
clearance continue to hold th ese medications until MTX level is less than 0.1 M.
For patient's allergic to or experiencing excessive myelosuppression with TMP/SMX, alternative 
prophylaxis with dapsone (1-2 mg/kg/day, maximum dose 100 mg/day), or atovaquone 
(30mg/kg/day if 1-3 mo. or> 2 years, 45 mg/kg/day if between 3 mo. & 2 years) may be 
considered.
Hold any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, penicillin, proton pump inhibitors or 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]- containing medications on the day of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after 
the start of the HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.4 M. In the presence of 
delay ed clearance continue to hold these medications until MTX level is less than 0.1 M.
Recommended Prehydrat ionwith D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L at 125 mL /m2/hour for at 
least 6 hours and until urine specific gravit y is 1.010 and pH is 7 and 8. Ringers Lactate 
may be used as the initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing solution is unavailable. Adjust fluid 
volume and sodium bicarbonate to maintain urine specific gravity  and pH at above parameters. 
Give a bicarbonate bolus (25 mEq/m2over 15 min) to raise the urine pH relativel y quickl y, a 
normal saline bolus may also be helpful in facilitating hydration. Continue hydration and 
alkalinization throughout HD MTX infusion, and for a minimum of 48 hours after its 
completion. In patients with delay ed MTX clearance, continue hydration until the plasma MTX 
concentration is below 0.1 M.
Hour 0: MTX 500 mg/m2IV mixed in a final volume of 65 mL/m2D5 ¼ NS with 30mEq 
NaHCO 3/L and infused over 30 minutes. This is followed, immediately , by [CONTACT_320498] 4500 mg/m2
mixed in a final volume of 2935 mL/m2D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L given by [CONTACT_320499] 23.5 hours at 125 mL /m2/hr. Be certain that the HD MTX infu sion is completed 
in the 24 hour period. Unintentional prolongation to as long as 26 hours though not encouraged 
is acceptable.
Hours 24, (36), 42 and 48 : Draw MTX level and serum creatinine; NOTE: 36 hour level is only  
drawn if needed (see below)
For MTX levels that exceed these expected values modify the rescue regimen as noted 
below and increase hydration to 200 mL/m2/hr, monitor urine pH to assure a value 7 and 
monitor urine output to determine if volume is 80% of thefluid intake, measured every  
4hours. If serum creatinine rises significantly , at any  time point, assure appropriate urine pH and 
urine volume as above and draw a 42 hour level. If urine output fails to continue at 80% of the

(carbox ypeptidase G2) (See below) . For patients with delay ed clearance during a previous 
course, begin the following course with the increased hydration (200 mL/m2/hr). If subsequent 
course is not associated with delay ed cleara nce, attempt to use standard hy dration.
If the 24 hour level is < 150 Mdraw the next level at hour 42 and refer to table below.  
If the 24 hour level is 150 M and/or creatinine > 125% baseline , repeat level if MTX 
contamination is possible. If the value is “real” refer to the changes in hydration, etc. described 
above and repeat the level with a serum Cr at hour 36. Then refer to the table below.
If the 42 and 48 hour levels are 1 and 0.4 M, respectively , give leucovorin (racemic form)
at 15 mg/m2IV/PO at 42, [ADDRESS_395685] the start of methotrexate loading dose. No

APPENDIX 10 DEFINITION OF CNS LE [LOCATION_006]EMIA  AT DIAGNOSIS
CNS 1: In cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), absence of blasts on cytospin preparation, regardless 
of the number of white blood cells (WBCs).
CNS 2: I n CSF, presence < 5/ L WBCs and cy tospin positive for blasts, or > 5/uL WBCs but 
negative b y Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm:
CNS 2a: < 10/μL  RBCs; < 5/ L WBCs and cy tospin positive for blasts;
CNS 2b:  10/μL  RBCs; < 5/ L WBCs and cy tospin positive for blasts; and
CNS 2c: 10/μL RBCs; 5/L WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts but negative by 
[CONTACT_83972]/Bley er algorithm (see below).
CNS 3: In CSF, presence of 5/L WBCs and cytospin positive for blasts and/or clinical 
signs of CNS leukemia:
CNS 3a: < 10/μL  RBCs;  5/L WBCs and cy tospin positive for blasts;
CNS 3b: 10/μL RBCs, 5/L WBCs and positive by [CONTACT_83972]/Bley er algorithm 
(seebelow);
CNS 3c: Clinical signs of CNS leukemia (such as facial nerve palsy, brain/ey e involvement 
or hy pothalamic s yndrome).
Method of Evaluating Traumatic Lumbar Punctures (Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm)
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is traumatic and 
contains 5 WBC/μL  and blasts, the following algorithm should be used to distinguish between 
CNS2 and CNS3 disease:
CSF WBC    >    2X Blood WBC
CSF RBC Blood RBC
A patient with CSF WBC 5/μL , CSF RBC 10/μL, and cytospin positive for blasts, whose 
CSF WBC/RBC ratio is at least 2 X greater than the blood WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS3b disease 
at diagnosis. Otherwise, the patient has CNS2c disease.
Example: CSF WBC = 60/μL ; CSF RBC = 1500/μL ; blood WBC = [ZIP_CODE]/μL ; blood RBC = 3.0 
X 106/μL:
60      =   0.04   >   2X [ZIP_CODE]      = 0.015    (patient has CNS3b disease)

 Amendment Rationale: 
The following amendment was developed to  incorporate two key changes including: 
1) Changing the statistical design of the trial to allow comparison to historical external 
controls.  Specifically, the 3-year event free survival (EFS) of dasatinib plus chemotherapy will be compared to the 3-year EFS of chemotherapy alone from the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Pe diatrica - Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster ALL 
2000 (AIEOP BFM 2000) trial and the 3-year EFS of imatinib plus chemotherapy from the  European intergroup Study on post induction treatment of Philadelphia 
positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (EsPhA LL).  This analysis will improve the 
ability to interpret the safety and efficacy of dasatinib added to chemotherapy among other treatment options for this pediatric leukemia. 
2) Incorporating additional supportive care op tions for chemotherapy to accommodate 
the standard of care at sites in the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]). 
 
Additionally, typographical errors were also corrected.  This amendment impacts the 
study conduct (supportive care options with ch emotherapy) and data analysis (primary 
endpoint).  The amendment applies to all subjects and should be implemented after 
IRB/IEC/HA review. 
Details regarding changes are outlined in sequential order of the protocol. 
1) Study title, research hypothesis and primary endpoint were modified to incorporate 
comparison to historical controls 
2) Complete remission ra tes added as a key secondary objective 
3) Changed vincristine dose from day 1 to day 2 in HR1 and HR2 blocks of treatment 
4) Included recommendation for pneumocys tis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis 
5) Moved optional hydration guidelines w ith cyclophosphamide a nd ifosfamide to 
Appendix 12 (supportive care guidelines) 
6) Added additional option for alternative hydration a nd methotrexate infusion 
guidelines commonly used in the [LOCATION_006] to Appendix 1 
7) Included “calcium folinate” and “leucovorin” as additional nomenclature for citrovorum factor (folinic acid) 
8) Clarified that corticosteroid eye drops are suggested with high dose Ara-C administration 
9) Clarified that G-CSF incorporated in HR 1, HR2, and HR3 blocks are optional and 
incorporated into Appendix 12 (supportive care guidelines) 
10) Clarified that asparaginase formulation, PEG-ASP (ONCOSPAR), may be administered either i.v. or i.m.

Dasatinib CA180372
BMS -354825 Protocol Amendment 02
3
This document contains information confidential and proprietary to Bristol -Myers SquibbAmendment Rationale:
The key purpose sof this amendment are to incorporate the following key  changes:
1.Introduce a new pediatric formulation of dasati nib, a berry  flavored oral suspension 
constituted from a powder (also known as the powder for oral suspension (PFOS)) as 
an alternative for administering dasatinib to children unable to swallow tablets. This 
revision should have no impact on study  conduct or data analy sis. This revision 
applies to all subjects not able to swallow tablets.
2.Address lack of availability  of native -asparaginase in the [LOCATION_002] and allow use of 
Peg-Asparaginase upfront in such instances as well as provide more detailed 
instruction for dose modifications of the various asparaginase formulations. This 
revision should have no impact on study  conduct or data analy sis. This revision 
applies to all subjects as indicated in the protocol. 
3.Indicate that the BCR -ABL  mutation status will be reported for baseline and at time of 
progression as a secondary  objective instead of as an exploratory  objective in order to 
bring into alignment with the binding elements of the Pediatric Investigational Plan 
with the EMA. These baseline samples were being collected prior to this amendment 
as per the Time and Events table. This revision should have no impact on study  
conduct and is applicable to all subjects.
4.Since Philadelphia chromosome status determined by [CONTACT_937]-PCR with peripheral blood is 
unlikely to result in a false positive result, Philadelphia chromosome positivity  from 
peripheral blood will be acceptable for study  entry as well as the conventional 
approach in this setting using a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]. This revision should have no 
impact on study  conduct or data analy sis. This revision applies to all subjects.
5.The acceptable window for screening activities was expanded from 15 days prior to 
treatment with dasatinib to 21 days, except when noted otherwise, for two reasons; 
1)so that tests that m ay have been performed as part of the initial diagnostic work up 
such as chest X-ray, ECG, echocardiogram or MUGA and CSF sampling would not 
need to be repeated and 2) in the event there is a delay  in initiating day [ADDRESS_395699] s.
6. Prior stem cell transplant and Ph+ ALL occurring as a second malignant neoplasm after 
treatment of a prior malignancy  were added as exclusion criteria. Although these 
circumstances are rare the prognosis may be different, therefore, in this small study
such prior conditions will be excluded. This revision should have no impact on study  
conduct or data anal ysis. This revision applies to all subjects.
7.The definition of high risk group and low/standard risk group in response to Induction 1A 
treatment has b een modified. In Europe, for induction treatment not adopting a steroid 
1.[ADDRESS_395700] 0.01%; 
low/standard risk would be defined as day [ADDRESS_395701] < 0.01%. This approach is 
consistent with the criteria used in other COG trials, and/or NCI risk group and being 
adopted by [CONTACT_320502]. This revision will impact study  conduct by [CONTACT_320503]. The data 
analysis will be used to conduct a sensitivity  analysis around the EFS endpoint. This 
revision applies to all subjects.
This amendment also provides for clarifications, fixes inconsistencies across sections of the 
protocol and repairs typographical errors as described below. These revisions should improve 
consistenc y in study  conduct but is not expected to have an impact on data analysis. These 
revisions apply  to all subjects as they  proceed through the treatment blocks.
Changes to the Protocol:
1.Synopsis: Study  Design Section ,Design paragraph
a)1st Paragraph, 2nd tolast sentence “recovery  period (14 days, 2 weeks),” deleted as this 
period is alread y included as the last 2 weeks of HR3 when only dasatinib is 
administered .
b)1st Paragraph, l ast sentence “L” deleted from asparaginase as various forms are allowed.
c)2nd Par agraph, added a new second sentence and revised subsequent sentence to more 
clearl y indicate that the use of dasatinib is optional in HSCT subjects. This change was 
made to be consistent with the in -body  text of the existing protocol.
2.Synopsis: Statistical Methods
a)1st sentence added less than sy mbol for clarit y.
b)Last Paragraph, objective regarding BCR -ABL mutation status moved from exploratory 
objectives to secondary  objectives and added “at baseline” to text to bring into alignment 
with the binding element s of the Pediatric Investigational Plan with the EMA. These 
baseline samples were being collected prior to this amendment as per the Time and 
Events table.
3.Section 1.3.2 Secondary  Objectives and Section 1.3.3 Exploratory  Objectives
a)Objective regarding BCR -ABL mutation status moved from exploratory objectives to 
secondary  objectives and added “at baseline” to bring into alignment with the binding 
elements of the Pediatric Investigational Plan with the EMA. These baseline samples 
were being collected prior to this amendment as per the Time and Events table.

for Oral Suspension formulation provided for use in this study .
5.Section 3.1 Study  Design and Duration -Design Paragraph
a)2nd Paragraph, first sentence reworded for clarit y.
b) 2nd Paragraph, 5thbullet deleted as this period is actually alread y included as the last 
2weeks of HR3 when only  dasatinib is administered.
c)2nd Paragraph, 7th bullet deleted “overlaps 2 weeks with end of reinduction block 1)”to 
make consistent with Table 4.3A and section [IP_ADDRESS] which indicate Interim maintenance 
will start [ADDRESS_395702] backbone chemotherapy  administered in the 
previous phase (which is day 49 of a 63 day block). Dasatinib should continue through 
day 63 of the Reinduction block, until Interim Main tenance begins.
d) 3rd Paragraph, third sentence added to clarify  that patients receiving chemotherap y other 
than that prescribed in the protocol should be discontinued from the study and to 
specificall y state that dasatinib will not be provided if the patient receive s non- protocol 
chemotherap y and 4th, 5th and 6th sentences reworded .
e)4th Paragraph, added OR between the 1rst and 2nd bullet forclarity  and added an 
additional bullet to clarify the quantifiable range.

a)2nd Paragraph, 2nd and 3rd sentences reworded to emphasize that treatment with 
dasatinib for an additional [ADDRESS_395704] is optional.
b) 2nd Paragraph, deleted last sentence which stated there was “no evidence that subjects 
who relapse after multi -agent chemotherap y or HSCT with the addition of dasatinib 
would benefit from further dasatinib treatment” since there is also no evidence that that 
these subjects would not benefit from continued dasatinib treatment. Since this is not a 
question addressed in this study , this sentence was deleted.
7.Section 3.3.1 Inclusion Criteria , Target Population 
a)Item 2 a i, “deleted conventional bone marrow” to allow use of PH positivity  determined 
from periphe ral blood as well.
b)Item 2 c iv, r eorganized acceptable tests for assessment of renal function and added

unnecessary  repeat of assessments preformed during diagnostic work -up and to 
accommodate delay s in in itiating day  15 of the backbone chemotherapy .
d)Added new criteria letter eto remind COG sites (excluding DFCI Consortium sites) that 
subjects must be enrolled in the COG Classification Trial (AALL08B1 or successor).

a)Item a, reworded for clarity . The intent of the exclusion criteria regarding active sy stemic 
bacterial, fungal or viral infections was to prevent the enrollment of patients with ongoing 
serious infections. Infection alone is not a concern for enrolling in the trial. Serious 
infections, with the noted complications of septic shock syndrome that require either 
vasopressor support or mechanical ventilation would be severe enough so that study  
enrollment may  not be in the best interest of the patient .
b)Added new criteria letters e and f.

15.Section 4.[ADDRESS_395708] and Table 4.3A
a)2nd Paragraph, or no later than when the day  15 induction chemotherapy  is administered” 
added in the 2nd sentence. This will allow for minor delay s due to scheduling 
adjustments or toxicity  of Induction 1A backbone chemotherap y.
b) L- ASP/iv (2h) or im clarified to ASP/iv (1-2h) or im for all Phases to accomodate 
different asparaginase forms and their associated infusion times.
c)L-ASP clarified to asparaginase in the abbreviations at the en d of the table.
d)“ Starts no sooner than day 33” added to the Induction Therap y Phase 1B column to 
provide clarit y.
e)Sentence regarding recovery  period under Consolidation Block 3 was deleted to eliminate 
confusion. This recovery period refers to the 2 weeks in Consolidation Block 3 when no 
backbone chemotherap y is given however dasatinib continues, therefore the 2 weeks are 
alread y included in the 21 days of Block 3 and this additional recovery period is not 
necessary .
16.Section [IP_ADDRESS] I nduction Therap y Phase 1A
a)2nd Paragraph, 1st and 2nd sentences modified for clarit y and to allow for a window for

Protocol Amendment 03 CA180372
BMS -354825 dasatinib
3Amendment Rationale:
The key  purposes of this amendment are to incorporate the following key  changes:
1.Increase the number of treated subjects from [ADDRESS_395717] 75 and upto 90.The rate of 
subjects discontinuing study  participation prior to reaching 3 years of follow -up from the 
start of dasatinib without having an event may potentially  reach 20%. In order to assure
robustness of the long-term efficacy  and safet y analy sis results , up to 15 additional subjects 
may be treated in the trial.
2.Modify  language regarding pregnancy  prevention. Dasatinib has not been formally  studied in 
pregnant women. However, the dasatinib team has recently  completed a comprehensive 
review of the BMS Das atinib safety  database (CARES) for all pregnancies in female patients 
or female partners of male patients in order to reassess  the risk of use of dasatinib during 
pregnancy .  Pregnancies in female patients on dasatinib sometimes resulted in spontaneous 
abortions or infant and fetal anomalies.   Based on this analy sis and a revision to an internal 
BMS directive related to “Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) in clinical trials”, 
BMS protocols in the dasatinib program are being amended to: 
update langua ge related to WOCBP to harmonize with the new BMS directive including 
the requirement of 2 forms of birth control one of which is regarded as a highl y effective 
form.
define highly  effective forms of birth control
adjust language related to sexually  active fertile male study  participants with WOCBP 
partners and define the duration of birth control use after the last dose of investigational 
product as 90 day s (duration of spermatogenesis).
3.Incorporate recommendations for subject management and supportive care during High Risk 
(HR) Blocks 1-3.  The three HR blocks are profoundly  myelosuppressive and also include 
5days of high dose dexamethasone.  Because clinical signsof infection can be blunted 
following high dose dexamethasone therapy , a very low threshol d should be considered for 
admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or institution of empi[INVESTIGATOR_320482] , growth factor 
support should be considered starting anytime 24 hours or more after completion of 
chemotherap y (as noted in protocol appendix) and blood counts should be monit ored 2-3x 
week until recovery . This guidance has been further highlighted within each of the HR 
blocks.
This amendment also provides for clarifications, fixes inconsistencies across sections of the 
protocol and repairs t ypographica l errors as described below. 
These revisions should improve consistency  in study  conduct but arenot expected to have an 
impact on data analysis. These revisions apply to all subjects as they proceed through the 
treatment blocks.

Protocol Amendment 04 CA180372
BMS -354825 dasatinib
2Amendment Rationale:
The key  purposes of this amendment are to incorporate the following changes:
1.Add mandatory  supportive care measures during the [ADDRESS_395727]. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has 
been informed and has confirmed that the number of deaths does not meet the protocol defined 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].
From the published experience in EsPhALL as well as the unpublished experience in the 
amended EsPhALL setting, up to 10% of high-risk patients treated with the AIEOP -BFM -2000 
chemotherap y backbone plus imatinib suffer from fatal complications which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y septic/ 
infectious in etiology  after the intensive High Risk chemotherap y blocks1,2.
Based on the events observed in this study  a number of changes are being instituted to the 
supportive care measures during the High Risk treatment blocks.
Mandatory blood counts with differential every 2 days after completion of 
chemotherapy until there is evidence of marrow recovery. These blocks are highl y 
myelosuppressive. Recovery  is defined as ANC > 0.2 x109/L (200/l) and platelet 
transfusion independence.
Mandatory myeloid growth factor support: G-CSF 5µg/kg/day  s.c. or i.v. starting any time 
from 7 to 11 days from the start of the block, until the WBC count is > 3.0 x109/L 
(>3000/mm3).The option of pegfilgrastim 100µg/kg s.c. given once during the 7-11th day 
from the start of the block may  be considered as an alternative.
Although not required, the investigators should STRONGLY consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320483] y, particularl y during the 
period of profound myelosuppression, until blood count recovery  because this is the 
intervention most likely  to reduce t he death rate.
A low threshold should be used for institution of empi[INVESTIGATOR_320444] y as clinical 
signs for infection can be blunted following high dose dexamethasone therap y.This 
particular guidance remains consistent with the revised protocol of July  31, 2013.
These supportive measures should be implemented immediately  in all patients during the High 
Risk treatment blocks. The impact of these supportive measures on the conduct of the study  will 
be more frequent subject monitoring with the potential for prompt intervention, thereby 
[CONTACT_320506] y. No impact on data anal ysis is expected.
2.Provide updates to the women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP) language to harmonize this 
language with the current BMS directives for WOCBP.

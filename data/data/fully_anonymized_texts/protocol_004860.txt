03.007A.03        Syneos Health  Page 18 of 51 6. GENERAL ASPECTS FOR STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
6.1. GENERAL METHODS  
The statistical analysis will be conducted following the principles specified in the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Topic E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical 
Trials (CPMP/ICH/363/96).  
All statistical tabulations and analyse s will be done using SAS®, Version 9. 4 or higher.  
All results collected in the database will be presented in listings.  
Unless otherwise stated, summary statistics including the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum will be presented for 
continuous variables. Generally , the minimum and maximum values will be presented to 
the same decimal precision as the raw values, the mean and median values to one more, and the standard deviation, to two more decimal places than the raw values. This 
decimal place convention may be followed for all data elements.  For categorical 
variables, per category, the absolute counts (n) and percentages (%) of subjects with 
data, and if appropriate, the number of subjects with missing data, will be presented. 
Percentages will be presented to one decimal place.  
For adverse events, medical history and concomitant medications reported on a per -
subject basis, the denominator for the percentage calculation will be the number of 
subjects at ri sk in each treatment group. A subject will be considered at risk if the 
subject is in the analysis set and in the subgroup of interest.  
All p-values will be rounded to 4 decimal places. If a p- value is less than 0.0001 it will 
be displayed as “< 0.0001”.  
Due to technical issues with the eDiary, any duplicate eDiary entries for a given time  
point will utilize the earliest recorded entry for analyses.  
Unless otherwise specified all efficacy analyses will be based upon the modified intent -
to-treat population  and all safety as well as demographic and baseline characteristic 
analyses will be based upon the safety population.   
Only data from nominal protocol scheduled visits will be included in the summary tables. Data from unscheduled visits will not be included in the summary tables but will 
be included in the listings.   Subjects who withdraw/drop out from the study will have 
their collected  ET visit data included in the analysis based on the closest visit window.  
Visit windows will be assigned by [CONTACT_390478].  If more than one record falls within the window, the one closest to 
the target date will be used in the analysis.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  Zosano Pharma Corporation Protocol #CP -2017 -001 
Final Version 1.0  Syneos Health #[ADDRESS_489649] and will be 
defined as:  
Age (years) = integer value ((Date of Screening –  Date of Birth + 1) / 365.25) . 
6.2.3.  Study Day  
Study Day [ADDRESS_489650] study drug administration date, study 
day will be calculated as (date of interest –  first study drug administration date  + 1). If 
the date o f interest occurs prior to the first study drug administration date, study day 
will be calculated as (date of interest –  first study drug administration date).  
6.3. MISSING DATA  
There will be no imputation for missing data, unless otherwise specified.  
AEs and C Ms with incomplete start dates will be considered as treatment -emergent or 
prior/concomitant, respectively, according to the following algorithm:  
1. If the AE occurrence type is specified for the AE on the eCRF, it will be  
used to determine treatment -emergence.  This will be  verified using the 
algorithms below (steps 3 through 5 ). 
2. If a medication started and stopped prior to the start of study treatment, the  
 medication will be considered prior. This will be verified using the algorithms  
 below (steps 3 through 5 ). 
3. Only the start year is reported: If the year is after or the same as the year of the  
first dose date, the event will be considered treatment -emergent.  
4. Only the start month and year are reported: If the month/year is after or the  
same as the  month/year of the first dose date, then the event will be considered 
treatment- emergent.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  Zosano Pharma Corporation Protocol #CP -2017 -001 
Final Version 1.0  Syneos Health #[ADDRESS_489651] 
dose date, then the event will be considered treatment -emergent.  
The missing severit y of an AE will be imputed to “severe”; the missing relationship to 
study drug of an AE will be imputed to “ probably related”.  
6.4. VISIT WINDOWS  
Nominal Visits will be used in the analyses as reported on the eCRF. As per section 6.1, the subjects who withdraw/ drop out from the study will have their ET visit data 
collected included in the analysis based on the closest visit window.  
6.5. POOLING OF CENT RES 
There will be no adjustment for multiple centers.  
6.6. SUBGROUPS 
No subgroups analysis will be performed.

Final Version 1.0  Syneos Health #[ADDRESS_489652] DISPOSITION AND WITHDRAWALS  
The number of subjects who were screened , entered run- in, entered the treatment 
phase,  treated, completed 6 months, completed 12 months, and terminated from the 
study  early will be summarized. The reasons  for early termination of treatment or from 
the study  will be summarized. Subjects who sign informed consent but do not enter the 
treatment phase  will be listed along with failure type (screening or run- in) and reason 
for failure . Additionally, a summary of subjects present at each visit will be 
summarized. The number of subjects in each analysis population will be reported.  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria definitio ns and violations will be listed. If no 
inclusion/exclusion criteria violations are reported, this will be noted in place of the 
listing.  
7.2. DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER  BASELINE CHARACTERIST ICS 
Demographic and baseline characteristic variables such as age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, and weight will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  For categorical 
variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, SD, minimum, and 
maximum) . 
Age at Study  day 1 = (Study day 1 visit date -  date of birth + 1) / 365.25 and truncated 
to complete years.  
Height (in cm) = height (in inches) * 2.54  
Weight (in kg) = weight (in lbs) * 0.4536  
BMI (kg/m
2) = Weight ( kg)/[Height(m)2]. 
Baseline characteristic s, including medical history,  Fitzpatrick skin scale results, 
migraine history, headache/migraine medication history and current drug or alcohol 
usage will also be summarized descriptively for the safety population.  
7.3. MEDICAL HISTORY AND CONCOMITANT DISEASES  
A summary table of the number and percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_390479] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) will be produced using the safety population. 
Previous and concurrent diseases/conditions will be sorted alphabetically by [CONTACT_390480] (MedDRA) coding dictionary, version 20.[ADDRESS_489653] will be counted only once 
within preferred term if he/she experienced multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_246501] .

<Sponsor Name> Protocol XXX ( Syneos Health  study number xxx)                 
Draft/Final Run <date>  
• All output should have Page n of N at the top  or bottom right corner of each page. 
TLFs should be internally paginated in relation to the total length (i.e., the page 
number should appear sequentially as page n of N, where N is the total number of 
pages in the table).  
• The date output was generated  should appear along with the program name  [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a 
footer on each page.  
15.2.3.  Display Titles  
• Each TLF should be identified by [CONTACT_150152] a numeral . (i.e., Table 1 4.1.1 ). 
ICH E3 numbering is strongly recommended but  sponsor preferences should be 
obtained pr ior to final determination (see also template 03.007C “Table of Contents  
for Tables Listings and Figures in Statistical Analysis Plan”) . A decimal system (x.y 
and x.y.z) should be used to identify TLFs with related contents. The title is 
centered. The analysis set should be identified on the line immediately following 
the title. The title and table designation are single spaced. A solid line spanning the 
margins will separate the display titles from the  
•  Column headers. There will be [ADDRESS_489683] Line of Title  
Second Line of Title if Needed 
ITT Analysis Set  
15.2.4.  Column Headers  
• Column headings should be displayed immediately below the solid line described 
above in initial upper -case characters.  
• In the case of efficacy tables, t he variable (or characteristic) column will be on the 
far left followed by [CONTACT_390487] (if applicable) . 
P-values may be presented under the total column or in separate  p-value column (if 
applic able).  Within- treatment comparisons may have p -values presented in a row 
beneath the summary statistics for that treatment.

03.007A.03        Syneos Health  Page 42 of 51 • For numeric variables, include “unit” in column or row heading when appropriate.  
• Analysis set sizes will be presented for each treat ment group in the column heading 
as (N=xx) (or in the row headings if applicable). This is distinct from the ‘n’ used for 
the descriptive statistics representing the number of subjects in the analysis set.  
• The order of treatments in the tables and listings will be  Placebo first in the case of 
placebo controlled studies and Active comparators first in the case of active 
comparator trials, followed by a t otal column  (if applicable).  
15.2.5.  Body of the Data Display  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Conventions  
Data in columns of a table or listing should be formatted as follows:  
• alphanumeric values are left -justified;  
• whole numbers (e.g., counts) are right -justified; and 
• numbers containing fractional portions are decimal aligned.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Table Conventions  
• Units will be included where available  
• If the categories of a parameter are ordered, then all categories between the 
maximum and minimum category should be presented in the table, even if n=0 for 
all treatment groups in a given category that is between the minimum and maximum 
level for that parame ter. For example, the frequency distribution for symptom 
severity would appear as:  
Severity 
Rating  N 
severe  0 
moderate  8 
mild 3 
Where percentages are presented in these tables, zero percentages will not be 
presented and so any counts of 0 will be presented as 0 and not as 0 (0%).  
• If the categories are not ordered (e.g., Medical History, Reasons for Discontinuation 
from the Study, etc.), then only those categories for which there is at least [ADDRESS_489684] represented in 1 or more groups should be included.  
• An Unknown or Missing category should be added to any parameter for which information is not available for 1 or more subjects.   
• Unless otherwise specified, the estimated mean and median for a set of values 
should be printed out to [ADDRESS_489685] deviations should be printed out to 2 more significant digits than the original values. The minimum and maximum should report the same significant digits 
as the original values. For example, for systolic blood pre ssure:

Mean  XXX.X  
Std Dev   X.XX  
Median  XXX.X  
Minimum  XXX 
Maximum  XXX 
• P-values should be output in the format: “0.xxx”, where xxx is the value rounded to 
3 decimal places. Any p- value less than 0.001 will be presented as <0.001. If the p-
value should be less than 0.0001 then present as <0.0001. If the p- value is returned 
as >0.999 then present as >0.999  
• Percentage values should be printed to one decimal place, in parentheses with no 
spaces, one space after the count (e.g., 7 (12.8%), 13 (5.4%)).  Pre-determine how to 
display values that round down to 0.0.  A common convention is to display as '<0.1', 
or as appropriate with additional decimal places. Unless otherwise noted, for all 
percentages, the number of subjects in the analysis set for the tre atment group who 
have an observation will be the denominator. Percentages after zero counts should 
not be displayed and percentages equating to 100% should be presented as 100%, 
without any decimal places.  
• Tabular display of data for medical history, prio r / concomitant medications, and all 
tabular displays of adverse event data should be presented by [CONTACT_150154], 
treatment class, or SOC with the highest occurrence in the active treatment group 
in decreasing order, assuming all terms are coded. Within the body system, drug 
class and SOC, medical history (by [CONTACT_11702]), drugs (by [CONTACT_61094]1 code), and 
adverse events (by [CONTACT_390488]) should be displayed in decreasing order. If 
incidence for more than 1 term is identical, they should then be sorted 
alphabetically.  Missing descriptive statistics or p- values which cannot be estimated 
should be reported as “ -”. 
• The percentage of subjects is normally calculated as a proportion of the number of 
subjects assessed in the relevant treatment group (or overall) for the analysis set presented. However, careful consideration is required in many instances due to the 
complicated nature of se lecting the denominator, usually the appropriate number of 
subjects exposed. Describe details of this in footnotes or programming notes.  
• For categorical summaries (number and percentage of subjects) where a subject can 
be included in more than one category , describe in a footnote or programming note 
if the subject should be included in the summary statistics for all relevant categories or just 1 category and the criteria for selecting the criteria.  
• Where a category with a subheading (such as system organ cl ass) has to be split over 
more than one page, output the subheading followed by “(cont)” at the top of each subsequent page.  The overall summary statistics for the subheading should only be 
output on the first relevant page.

03.007A.03        Syneos Health  Page 44 of 51 [IP_ADDRESS].  Listing Conventions  
• Listings w ill be sorted for presentation in order of treatment groups as above, 
subject number, visit/collection day, and visit/collection time.  
• Missing data should be represented on subject listings as either a hyphen (“ -”) with 
a corresponding footnote ( “- = unknown or not evaluated”), or as “N/A”, with the 
footnote “N/A = not applicable”, whichever is appropriate.  
• Dates should be printed in SAS® DATE9.format (“ ddMMMyyyy”: 01JUL2000). Missing 
portions of dates should be represented on subject listings as dashes ( --JUL2000). 
Dates that are missing because they are not applicable for the subject are output as 
“N/A”, unless otherwise specified.  
• All observed time values must be presented using a 24 -hour clock HH:MM or 
HH:MM:SS format (e.g., 11:26:45, or 11:26). Time will only be reported if it was 
measured as part of the study.  
• Units will be included where available  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Figure Conventions  
• Unless otherwise specified, for all figures, study visits will be displayed on the X- axis 
and endpoint ( e.g., treatment mean chang e from Baseline) values will be displayed 
on the Y -axis. 
15.2.6.  Footnotes  
• A solid line spanning the margins will separate the body of the data display from the 
footnotes.  
• All footnotes will be left justified with single -line spacing immediately below the 
solid line underneath the data display.  
• Footnotes should always begin with “Note:” if an informational footnote, or 1,  2, 3, 
etc. if a reference footnote. Each new footnote should start on a new line  where 
possible . 
• Subject specific footnotes should be avoided, where possible . 
• Footnotes will be used sparingly and must add value to the table, figure, or data 
listing. If more than six lines of  footnotes are planned, then a cover page may be 
used to display footnotes, and only those essential to comprehension of the  data will 
be repeated on each page.  
• The last line of the footnote section will be a standard source line that indicates the 
name [CONTACT_272348], date the program was run, 
and the listing source (i.e., ‘Program : myprogram .sas    Listing source: 16.x.y.z’).

CONFIDENTIAL  Description of Study Design:  This is a randomized clinical trial to assess whether a subject  
centered, self -collection of DBS samples will improve 
compliance with the clinical recommendation of weekly CMV 
testing of HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_140087].  Subjects will be randomized (2:1) to DBS monitoring or 
standard of care (per local institution) monitoring. Subjects in the 
DBS arm will receive training on the collection and shipment of 
the sample to a central laboratory for CMV PCR testing. Periodic whole blood samples also will be collected along with a DBS sample for plasma CMV PCR testing.  Subjects in the 
standard monitoring arm will be followed per standard of care monitoring for their transplant center. Data from the CMV testing done at the local si te will be collected from the subject’s 
chart.

CONFIDENTIAL  2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE 
 Background Information  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_140088] (CMV) end organ disease after HCT, CMV monitoring adherence decreases 
significantly after day 100, when patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_140089]. 
Preliminary data (section 2.1.4.) indicate that fewer than 50% of patients who are 
recommended to continue CMV testing do so throughout the recommended testing period; 
the drop-off starts as soon as two months after discharge. Consequently, the incidence of late 
CMV end organ disease (defined as disease occurring after day [ADDRESS_159064]) remains high at 8% in the current era with recommended surveillance testing and preemptive therapy. Half these cases are CMV pneumonia, which continues to carry a subst antial risk of death  (section 
2.1.3). In a recent multicenter randomized trial of prophylaxis compared to preemptive therapy for the prevention of late CMV disease the incidence of late CMV disease was only 2% 
1. During the trial, study coordinators were in close contact [CONTACT_140131], resulting 
in a CMV monitoring completion rate of 93%. Similarly, high rates of adherence are also routinely achieved during the first [ADDRESS_159065] while patients are tr eated in 
specialized cancer centers, and these adherence rates correlate with CMV disease rates between 0 and 3%. However, outside of the clinical trial setting, the requirement for weekly 
blood draws is burdensome for patients late after HCT. In general, the frequency of CMV 
monitoring decreases as the frequency of doctor’s office visits decreases, resulting in missed opportunities for preemptive therapy. Finger- stick collected DBS CMV testing would allow 
subjects to collect their samples at home and mail the cards directly to the laboratory. This method of CMV PCR testing has been validated in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_140090] a preemptive therapy approach late after transplantation  
2,3. 
In addition, mobile technology can be used to automate simple reminder and notification systems and to facilitate ongoing communication among the patient, their primary oncologist, and the transplant center. There is good evidence 
4,5 that these types of reminders are 
efficacious for improving medication adherence; however, it has not yet been tested in the setting of post-transplant virologic monitoring.

DMID/NIAID/NIH           [ADDRESS_159067] 50-90% of US adults and is a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised population. CMV infection 
can be acquired through multiple means, including: mother- to-child (in utero, breast 
milk), infected body fluids (saliva, genital secretions), blood transfusion, or organ transplant. The prevalence of CMV infection increases with age throughout life such 
that by [CONTACT_654] 90; ~90% of persons will have acquired CMV infection 
6. In 
immunocompetent persons, following primary infection by [CONTACT_140132], CMV is controlled by [CONTACT_140133] (“dormancy”) in multiple organs and cell-types for the life of the host. In particular, 
the lung represents one of the largest reservoirs of latent CMV in seropositive hosts, 
and may explain the propensity for CMV-associated pulmonary disease in predisposed hosts 
7. During periods of immunosuppression (or as a result of specific 
stimuli such as TNF -α, LPS, or catecholamines that are commonly associated with 
critical illness and sepsis 8), CMV can reactivate from latency (preferentially in the 
lung) to produce active infection (viral replication). In persons with impaired cellular immunity, reactivation can progress to high- grade CMV replication , tissue injury , and 
clinically evident disease such as CMV pneumonia. Lower- grade CMV reactivation 
that is otherwise clinically silent (“subclinical”) can also be detected in apparently immunocompetent persons with critical illness using sensitive techniques such as 
PCR 
1. In addition, even low- level, otherwise asymptomatic subclinical CMV 
reactivation can produce significant biologic effects both in vitro and in vivo, such as 
inflammation, fibrosis, and immunosuppression. These biological effects of CMV have been shown to occur through various mediators and other indirect means 
(reviewed in 
9). Importantly, several important CMV- associated adverse clinical 
outcomes in transplant populations (e.g. allograft rejection, secondary infections) are 
not necessarily accompanied by [CONTACT_140134] 10–12. 
 Importance and Risk Factors for Late CMV Disease after HCT  
The phenomenon of late CMV disease was first recognized in the early 1990s when 
the first reports were published about effective prevention of early CMV disease, and, 
at the same time, cases of delayed onset CMV disease were observed 13. Since then, a 
substantial body of literature indicates that CMV disease can be prevented during the 
first [ADDRESS_159068] Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]     30 June 2022

CONFIDENTIAL  prophylaxis is stopped or the preemptive strategy is applied less rigorously, CMV 
disease incidence rises again. As a result, the majority of CMV disease now occurs 
after day 100, resulting in a much longer period of high risk 2,3,14,16 –19. Late CMV 
disease (defined as disease presenting after day [ADDRESS_159069]) occurs primarily 
between day [ADDRESS_159070] risk for late CMV infection and disease can be identified by [CONTACT_4475] 100 
2. 
Without intervention, the incidence of late CMV disease ranges from about 10% to 
17% of CMV seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_140091] 100 2. Mechanistically, 
lymphopenia and delayed reconstitution of CMV- specific T -cell responses are the 
immunologic defects that predispose patients to late CMV complications 2. In 
seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] a positive donor (D+/R- ), late CMV disease seems to 
occur almost exclusively in patients who had evidence of primary CMV infection 
during the first 100 days and the incidence of late CMV disease is similar to that 
observed in CMV seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 3. 
Approximately 50% of patients with late CMV disease present with pneumonia, followed by [CONTACT_140135] (40%) and other manifestations such as retinitis, 
encephalitis, and late graft failure 
3. 
 Outcome of Late CMV  
The outcome of late disease remains poor, and late CMV disease is an independent risk factor for mortality in CMV seropositive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (adjusted hazard ratio 4.16 
[95% confidence interval 2.7-6.5]) 
3. The outcome following pneumonia is worse 
than that following other manifestations of late CMV disease with 60% of patients dying within 6 months of late CMV pneumonia (Figure 1) 
3,20. In a recent 
multivariate analysis, the outcome of CMV pneumonia occurring in the late period was not different from that early after HCT 
20.

 Approaches to Prevent Late CMV Disease  
Although preemptive therapy based on virologic monitoring is the most commonly used strategy to prevent CMV disease during the first [ADDRESS_159072]. Indeed, 
preliminary data demonstrate that outside a clinical trial setting (during which 
surveillance can be reinforced by [CONTACT_3462]), adherence to recommended surveillance recommendations is poor (Figure 2). This poor adherence is associated with continued high rates of late CMV disease. 
There is compelling data from both cohort studies and multicenter clinical trials, that 
preemptive therapy strategies are highly effective when administered properly (Table 1). Moreover, a recent study showed excellent performance for PCR- based 
preemptive therapy (started at a plasma viral load ≥1000 IU/mL) 
22. In this study, the 
CMV disease incidence was similar to what has been accomplished in other recent multicenter randomized trials early after HCT (Table 1).   This represents the first 
documentation in a randomized trial that preemptive therapy in the late setting can be 
highly effective if virologic monitoring is performed at >90% of expected time 
points. This rate contrasts starkly with what has been achieved with patients outside the clinical trial setting and provides the rationale for the key hypothesis of this proposal that home-based, mobile technology supported virologic monitoring will

CMV by [CONTACT_140137] 31–33. Self -collection of samples using swabs to 
examine the biology of herpesviruses (including CMV) is well established in healthy 
volunteers and HIV- infected subjects . It is not known whether giving subjects the 
ability to self -collect samples will improve compliance or whether CMV monitoring 
via DBS testing is sufficiently sensitive to detect re -emergence of late occurring 
CMV viremia.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dried Blood Spot Assay Design History  
The DBS  PCR assay was initially developed in 2001 using two primer/probe pairs, one of 
which amplifies the gB region and one the IE region of the CMV genome. Over the last 10 years, this PCR assay has been extensively used in clinical research  to study CMV 
infections of immunocompromised patients at both the University of Washington (UW) 
and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) and has proven to be a 
valuable tool for detection and monitoring of CMV reactivation and clinical disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary  of DBS Assay P erformance vs S tandard Plasma PCR C linical A ssay 
The performance of the current DBS PCR assay  was compared to  an ultrasensitive 
plasma PCR  assay (lower level of quantitation 50 IU/mL) that is used clinically at the 
University of Washington Clinical Virology Laboratory to monitor patients for CMV 
infection.  The standard used in the clinical PCR assay is the WHO International Standard for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).  Residual whole blood sample s from 
specimens  that were submitted  for clinical plasma PCR testing were also examined by [CONTACT_140138]. The primary goal of the study was to determine whether the DBS assay detected CMV DNA in whole blood samples that were determined to be positive at the 1000 (3.0 log 10) IU/mL level in the clinical PCR assay, a level that is commonly used to 
trigger preemptive treatment of patients in the late period after hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT).  As a secondary goal, the study also examined the ability of the DBS to detect CMV DNA in whole blood samples that are positive at the 500 (3.0 log10) 
IU/mL level, a le vel also used by [CONTACT_140139].  
Residual samples from patients who had plasma viral loads ≥150 (2.18 log
10) IU/ mL 
were spotted on to filter cards (50uL).  The residual blood sample was used with 24-[ADDRESS_159077] Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]     30 June 2022

CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS]  Limit of Detection  
Based on a complementary log-log model, the rate of detection or sensitivity of the DBS  
assay  at 2.99 log 10 IU/mL CMV in plasma is above 95% (Figure 4. Thus, the limit of 
detection would be about 2.98 logs or 102.98 = 955 IU/ml (see the reference lines at x -axis 
of 2.99 and y-axis of 0.95). Similar results are obtained compared to these only the first 
sample date was used per person (69 samples), with a cut off of 2.91 on the log 10 scale or 
812 IU/mL. Based on this model, the sensitivity at 500 (2.70 log 10) IU/mL is 8 5%, and 
the sensitivity at 100 0 (3.00 log10) IU/mL is  96%.  
 
Figure 4. Complementary log-log model to compare CMV viral load in plasma and the sensitivity of DBS  
Overall, the results of the most recent study shown above as well as prior clinical results  
us
ing earlier versions of the assay suggest that the DBS assay reliably detects viral loads 
of >1000 (3.0 log 10) IU/mL highly reliably and that the sen sitivity is somewhat lower 
between 500 (2.7 log 10) and 1000 (3.0 log 10) IU/mL.

DMID/NIAID/NIH           [ADDRESS_159080] survivors to perform CMV monitoring using finger- stick collected 
DBS testing in their home setting or to visit their doctor’s office to perform the test.  
 Rationale  
Given accumulating evidence that preemptive therapy is effective against CMV disease in 
the HCT setting with high (i.e., 90%+) adherence to the recommended CMV testing schedule 
22,24,25,35, a critical question is whether innovative easy- to-perform self-testing assisted by 
[CONTACT_140140]-on support that is available in the early post-transplant setting.  This is a proof-of-concept, multi- site, randomized  clinical trial to test whether 
subject -collected dried blood spot samples for CMV PCR testing can improve adherence to 
recommended CMV monitoring late after transplant compared to the s tandard of care.  The 
study will enroll HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_140095], therefore, at risk for late CMV disease. Assessing adherence in this population to the recommended CMV testing schedule is critical to evaluating whether adopting DBS self-
collection can improve the efficacy of preemptive therapy strategies and, therefore, 
potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with late CMV disease.  
 Potential Risks and Benefits 
 Potential Risks  
There are few potential risks associated with this study. Risk is primarily derived from the needle stick.  The following table presents risks based on experience with 
self-administered finger stick procedures. In theory, there is a risk of missing CMV 
cases due to the sensitivity limit of the DBS tests.  This information will be 
communicated to subjects in the sample informed consent form. 
Table 3. Summary of potential risks  
Less common  Pain and/or bruising at puncture site  
Uncommon or rare  Missed CMV cases due to sensitivity limits of DBS test  
Uncommon or rare  Infection at puncture site  
 Known Potential Benefits  
Study subjects may benefit from more frequent CMV monitoring and, as a result, 
more timely and effective initiation of preemptive therapy for CMV disease. It is also 
possible, though, that a study subject may not derive any benefit from participation in this trial .

CONFIDENTIAL  4 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized clinical trial to assess whether self -collection of samples (DBS) that are 
mailed for testing to a central laboratory will improve the compliance with the clinical 
recommendation of weekly CMV testing of HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. [ADDRESS_159089] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
≥[ADDRESS_159090]-transplant, will be randomized (2:1) to subject self -collected  DBS CMV monitoring 
with mobile technology support or standard of care with office -based testing. Randomization 
will occur when discharge from the transplant service is imminent, generally near day [ADDRESS_159091]-transplant (enrollment window day 60-[ADDRESS_159092]-transplant). DBS self -collections will 
start the week after discharge. More than 85% of late CMV disease occurs within the first year after HCT  
37. While most patients are discharged to long- term primary care providers 
approximately [ADDRESS_159093], some may be discharged earlier,  and some may stay 
longer with the transplant team due to complications. These latter patients are often at 
particularly high risk for late CMV complications and thus are important candidates for 
participation in this trial. For this reason, study entry is allowed up to 180 days (~6 months) after HCT and the duration of study participation is anticipated to be within a ra nge of [ADDRESS_159094] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(Observational Cohort) who meet eligibility criteria and have already consented for 
retrospective studies at the enrolling sites but are not participating in the DBS testing for 
CMV will be reviewed for the incidence and timing of CMV disease, morphologic relapse of 
the underlying disease, and death. Data from these subjects will be used to assess whether the 
randomized study sample is representative of the DBS  study population and  to obtain a 
population- based estimate of  late CMV disease.

 Randomized Cohort  
Following consent, subjects in the DBS arm of the study will be asked to perform weekly 
DBS collection  starting the week after discharge, once appropriate training has been provided 
(collection can be performed by a caregiver as long as appropriate training has been completed). Weekly reminders will be sent either as email or text messages. DBS samples will be mailed directly to the centra l lab (University of Washington) via pre-paid overnight 
mail ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up can be scheduled via the website or by [CONTACT_140141]) by [CONTACT_748] . 
Results will be transmitted via a secure server to participating  site staffs . The research staff 
will then contact [CONTACT_748]’ treating physicians via phone/fax notifying of positive results. The subjects will receive a notification via the study web portal when their positive CMV test 
results are available with a link to the se cure website that can be used to access them.  Text 
message reminders  have been effective in randomized trials of medication adherence 
5,38,39, 
but too frequent reminders may be counterproductive. The web/mobile technology employed 
in this trial allows subjects to select method of electronic reminders (email and/or text 
message) and day and time of weekly electronic reminders. At minimum, one reminder will 
be sent before the recommended test.  
In addition to the DBS S elf-Collection K its, subjects will be provided with  Confirmatory 
Whole Blood Collection Kits for a plasma CMV PCR test (one 6 ml EDTA tube and a DBS 
self-collection kit with shippi[INVESTIGATOR_140096]) . When subjects are notified of a positive DBS 
result  (a reminder will be provided with the notification of positive test results)  they will take 
the Confirmatory Whole Blood Collection kit to their clinical blood draw facility and get 
their samples collected as soon as possible. The clinical laboratory staff will draw the 
additional blood and use the pre-paid FedEx shippi[INVESTIGATOR_140097]. Decisions whether to administer 
preemptive treatment based on plasma viral load results will be made by [CONTACT_140142]. At the time of office -based blood draw for research confirmatory 
plasma CMV PCR, the subject will perform an additional DBS test, which will be sent together with the plasma sample to the central lab. These samples will provide additional 
virologic data to assess performance of the DBS assay. This method has been used 
successfully in a recently completed phase III trial 
22. 
Training of participants on the DBS self- collection procedures will include three training 
sessions with a study coordinator. The first session will describe, observe, and provide guidance on DBS self -collection procedures  and web/mobile technology. The second session 
will be a supervised session with the subject to observe and answer questions. It  is preferable 
that supervised DBS trainings with a study coordinator are done in-person; however, if this is

CONFIDENTIAL  not possible these supervised trainings may be completed remotely  via video conferencing as 
an option (See MOP for details and instructions). The third session will be unsupervised with 
the subject performing the testing in their home or temporary residence nearby [CONTACT_140143] a phone call or in- person check -in and a 
questionnaire to assess understanding. At each session, the subject will have written instructions on performing the DBS testing and utilizing the web/mobile technology 
available for their reference.  Each DBS training session requires the completion of a DBS 
collection.  The s tudy coordinator will be available to provide additional training session as 
needed.  In addition, DBS collection instructional video is available on the study website . 
Prior to discharge from the transplant care team, study personnel must confirm that the subject demonstrates proficiency in DBS sample collection  and use of the study website. 
The mobile technology will consist of a notification system that sends weekly reminders by 
[CONTACT_54769]/ or text message determined by [CONTACT_423]’s preference to the subject to complete 
DBS self -collection procedures . The notifications are sent from a web -based, [ADDRESS_159098] sample collection and shipment information. The system 
will also house IRB-approved training materials and the web address of the [LOCATION_002] 
Postal Services (USPS) so that shipments may be scheduled. 
Subjects who are enrolled in the control arm of the randomized  study will continue to receive 
their office -based CMV plasma testing as recommended by [CONTACT_9518].  
Quarterly follow- up contacts will be made with the primary care physicians of all 
randomized subjects enrolled in the study to obtain each subject’s medical record. Data from 
each subject’s medical record on immunosuppression, CMV disease status, any interim use 
of antiviral therapy for CMV disease or plasma reactivation, clinically recommended CMV 
test interval, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140098], relapse, and survival status will be collected.  
 Observational Cohort  
A parallel observational contemporary cohort will be established of up to 450 transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_140099] /or have consented at their site to have data from their charts abstracted for 
retrospective studies  and meet entry criteria for the randomized trial. Selection of eligible

will not be randomized (n=450). The list of randomized treatment assignments will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_140147] (Emmes) and included in the 
enrollment module of Emmes’ Internet Data Entry System (IDES).  IDES will assign each 
subject a study arm from the list after demographic (date of birth, race/ethnicity, and sex) and eligibility data have been entered into the system. Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_140148]’s perceived ease of access to blood draw facility . 
Observational cohort will be enrolled in IDES after the required demographic and 
eligibility information are entered. Instructions for use of the enrollment module are included in the IDES User’s Guide. Manual back -up randomization procedures are 
provided in the MOP for use in the event that the site temporarily loses access to the Internet or the online enrollment system is unavailable.  
Subject IDs will be assigned to potential subjects, who have documented informed 
consent by [CONTACT_140149], as they are screened. The subject ID will 
be used for all communications with outside institutions to ensure confidentiality. 
Subjects who are randomized and drop out of the study prior to beginning follow- up (first

scheduled study test (or prior to the start of late CMV surveillance)  for any reason , they 
will be replaced ; however, they will not be moved over to the observational cohort.  
For subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn prior to completion of the study, clinical 
information relevant to the secondary endpoint and the SAEs of special interest 
(proven/probable CMV disease) should continue to be obtained from the primary 
physicians’ office or medical records until the end of  the follow-up  unless the subject withdraws consent .  
The NIAID/DMID, the IRB and/or the FDA have the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to the 
following: 
 Incidence of AE’s indicating a potential health hazard 
 Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
 The Investigators has not been adhering to the protocol or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the study. 
 Handling of Withdrawals 
Eligible subjects who withdraw from the study between randomization and the first scheduled study test   (or prior to the start of late CMV surveillance) may be replaced. 
Reasons for withdrawal will be recorded in the Consort diagram.

 CMV PCR  
The DBS CMV assay consists of two major steps, an extraction to elute DNA from Whatman 903 Protein Saver Cards and purify it from other blood components on the DBS, followed by a real-time PCR to quantify the CMV present. The CMV PCR assay 
was initially developed in 2001 using two primer/probe pairs, one of which amplifies the 
gB region and one the IE region of the CMV genome. Over the last [ADDRESS_159119] Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]     30 June 2022

CONFIDENTIAL  11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Study Outcome Measures  
 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who complete >90% of their 
recommended CMV monitoring tests by 1- year post -transplant. We will use logistic 
regression modeling to compare this proportion between subjects randomized to DBS  
testing versus standard office- based testing. Since randomization will be stratified by  
[CONTACT_140163]’s perceived ease of access to blood draw facility, these factors 
will be used as adjustment factors in the models.  
For each subject, the number of CMV monitoring tests performed will be assessed and 
the percent of recommended tests will be calculated. Subjects with percent completion 
>90% will be considered a success with regard to the primary endpoint. The person-
specific denominator for the proportion, number of expected CMV monitoring tests, will be variable and dependent on subjects ’ immunosuppression and  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140115]. For example, subject s in this study that are highly immunosuppressed a weekly 
monitoring schedule is generally recommended, often throughout the first year after transplantation. If such a subject  were discharged from the primary transplant center at 
day 100, there would be [ADDRESS_159155] (if the subject  is still 
alive at 1 year). We will assess the actual number of tests performed and calculate the percent of tests (e.g. 36/38 = 94.7%). Another scenario would be for a subject  that 
stopped monitoring and was then re-started on high-dose steroids for treat ment of GVHD 
with resumption of weekly testing, resulting in yet another denominator. Study participants in the DBS arm who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140116]. Rather,  admitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140117]. Those inpatient testing timepoints will not be included in the person-specific denominator.  
The primary analysis will be an intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis of all subject s randomized. 
Another key analysis will be the modified intent to treat analysis of all subject s who had 
at least one test done after discharge from the primary transplant team.

DMID/NIAID/NIH           [ADDRESS_159157] a difference in late CMV disease incidence from 8% (current standard care) to 2% (observed in clinical trial). A trial powered for that detectable effect size would require [ADDRESS_159158] 
80% power (one-sided p values 0.05).  
To determine the rate of CMV disease at participating sites during the clinical trial we 
will collect concurrent retrospective baseline data as well as CMV disease and survival data from subject s that were eligible for randomization but decided not to participate (the 
majority of subject s return to the transplant center at one year). The purpose of this 
analysis is to determine whether the subject s who participated in the trial are 
representative of the population at risk for late CMV disease and whether the phenomenon of late CMV disease continues to occur throughout the study period.  
To assess the correlation of CMV viral load between DBS and plasma samples, we will 
use linear  model. Other outcomes will be tabulated and compared between groups using 
Chi-Square, Fisher’s exact , and log rank tests, as appropriate.  
The relative contribution of mobile phone reminders, subject adherence to the device, and failures of the testing kit itself will be analyzed among subjects randomized to the DBS arm who did not reach the 90% adherence threshold.  
 Sample Size Considerations  
Power calculations utilized a binomial distribution to ascertain the number of subjects needed to detect a clinically meaningful difference in proportions of subjects meeting the primary endpoint 
43. Based on our preliminary data, we assumed  the proportion of individuals completing >90% of 
their recommended surveillance tests in the standard office-based testing arm would be in the 
range of 50-55%. In our previously reported clinical trial, high rates of CMV monitoring 
completion resulted in the clinically relevant outcome of a low incidence of late CMV disease [ADDRESS_159159] s, 
randomized 2:1, we will have 90- 96% power to detect an absolute difference in testing rates of 
25-30% between subject s in the intervention (80% adherence) and control arms (50% adherence)

 Randomization Scheme  
Randomization will be done by [CONTACT_140164]. Subjects will be stratified at the time of randomization according to transplant 
site and subject’s perceived ease of access to blood draw facility in order to prevent major 
imbalances within  the study.  
 Analysis Plan  
As described under Primary Endpoint, the primary analysis will be a logistic regression analysis, 
comparing the study arms in an Intent- to-Treat analysis including all randomized subjects. Prior 
analyses will include careful checks of all key data elements (primary and secondary endpoints and subject  characteristics) to ascertain implausible and missing values. Reports including all 
missing and implausible values will be generated and elements will be checked with source documents to attempt to correct or r eplace those values.  If a data value is considered to be 
completely implausible and cannot be corrected with available information, its value will be considered “missing”. Once these edits have iterated until no further corrections can be made, each data element will be summarized by [CONTACT_30157], and percent of missing data evaluated.  
Ideally, missing data will be negligible in this study, but if that is not the case, we will determine the ideal method for handling this to avoid biased results (e.g. inverse probability weighting,

CONFIDENTIAL  multiple imputation, etc. ). Our final analysis plan will be reviewed prior to data lock and 
amended as needed before the start of analysis.  
The primary  study period for subjects that have been withdrawn from the study will be from 
randomization to the day of withdrawal . A sensitivity analysis will be performed to estimate the 
impact of withdrawal on the primary endpoint using the maximum possible study period.  
The study statistician may provide an analysis of aggregate, uncleaned data from the 
observational cohort on the estimates of late CMV disease and on the sensitivity of CMV 
detection by [CONTACT_140165]. While the results provided will not be used to make any decisions about the conduct of this study, they may be used to make 
decisions on activities external to this trial such as the design of other studies on CMV disease in 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_140119]. 
 
 Interim  Safety Monitoring 
Among the first [ADDRESS_159164] a year, if the lower one-sided 90% confidence interval for the percent of subjects experiencing CMV disease by [CONTACT_31806]- year exceeds 8% (operationally 7 out of 50), a DSMB 
meeting will be convened. The DSMB will be charged with determining whether this 
exceptionally high rate of CMV disease has plausible clinical explanations related to the 
subject  characteristics, or if it is the result of a failure in the monitoring system, and if so, 
what the source of the failure is (lack of compliance, failure of the system). Ultimately, 
they will make a recommendation to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_140120].

CONFIDENTIAL  14 ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 Ethical Standard  
The site principal investigator (PI) will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with 
principles of The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human 
Subjects of Research (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical 
and Behavioral Research [April 18, 1979]) and codified in 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50 and 21 CFR 56, as applicable. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_140122] E6; [ADDRESS_159169]  
Prior to enrollment of subjects into this trial, the approved protocol and informed consent form 
will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_140167]. 
The responsible official for the IRB will sign the IRB letter of approval of the protocol prior to 
the start of this trial and a copy will be provided to DMID. The IRB FWA number will be provided to DMID. 
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be written by [CONTACT_140168] [INVESTIGATOR_71467]. 
 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a 
trial and continuing throughout the individual’s trial participation.  Before any study procedures 
are performed, informed consent will be obtained and documented. Subjects will receive a 
concise and focused presentation of key information about the clinical trial, verbally and with a 
written consent form. The explanation will be organized and presented in lay terminology and 
language that facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate. If an in -
person informed consent cannot be obtained, remote informed consenting via video 
teleconferencing is permissible under the site’s IRB approved remote consenting policy (See 
MOP for details and instructions).  
An investigator or designee will describe the protocol to potential subjects in person. The key 
information about the purpose of the study, the procedures and experimental aspects of the study,

DMID/NIAID/NIH           [ADDRESS_159171].  
Subjects will also receive an explanation that the trial involves research and a detailed summary 
of the proposed study procedures and study interventions/products. This will include the aspects of the trial that are experimental, the probability for random assignment to treatment groups, any expected benefits,  and all possible risks (including a statement that the particular treatment or 
procedure may involve risks to the subject that are currently unforeseeable) . The expected 
duration of the subject’s par ticipation in the trial, alternative procedures that may be available , 
and the important potential benefits and risks of these available alternative procedures  will also 
be included in the detailed explanation. 
Subjects will be informed that they will be notified in a timely manner if information becomes 
available that may be relevant to their willingness to continue participation in the trial. Subjects will receive an explanation as to whether any compensation and any medical treatments are 
available if injury occurs, and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be 
obtained. Subjects will be informed of the anticipated financial expenses, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial, as well as any anticipated prorated payments, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial. They will be informed of whom to contact (e.g., the investigator) for 
answers to any questions relating to the research project. 
Information will also include the foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the 
subject’s participation in the trial may be terminated. The subjects will be informed that 
participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw from the study for any reason at any 
time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.  
The extent of the confidentiality of the subjects’ records will be defined, and subjects will be informed that applicable data protection legislation will be followed. Subjects will be informed 
that the monitor(s), auditors(s), IRB, NIAID, and regulatory authority(ies) will be granted direct 
access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_140169], and that, by [CONTACT_2960] a written informed consent form, the subject is 
authorizing such access. 
Subjects will be informed that records identifying the subject will be kept confidential, and, to 
the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly 
available and, if the results of the trial are published, the subjec t’s identity will remain 
confidential. Subjects will be informed whether private information collected from this research 
and/or specimens will be used for additional research, even if identifiers are removed.

the device in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
All records will be kept locked and all computer entry and networking programs will be carried 
out with coded numbers only and with password protected systems. All non -clinical specimens, 
evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified only by a coded 
number. 
 Future Use of Stored Specimens  
 
Subjects will be asked for permission to keep any remaining specimens for possible use in future 
research studies.  Residual specimens will be stored indefinitely at Fred Hutch. Before conducting 
additional research unrelated to the original research questions, the Fred Hutch IRB will review 
the request and decide whether the request meets minimal risk requirements or whether 
additional specific consent is required. The Fred Hutch IRB serves as central IRB for this issue. 
Subjects may opt out of future research unrelated to the original research question.  Samples may be shared with other investigators at other institutions. The samples will not be 
sold or used directly for production of any commercial product. Tests may include genetic 
research to look at things such as which genes affect infection or how genes work. Each sample will be encoded (labeled) only with a barcode and a unique tracking number to protect subject’s 
confidentiality.  
 
There are no benefits to subjects in the collection, storage, and subsequent research use of specimens.  Reports about future research done with a subject’s samples will NOT be kept in

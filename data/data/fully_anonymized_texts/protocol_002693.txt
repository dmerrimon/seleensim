improving role function. 
 For patients interested in reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], we aim to: (1) reduce prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_187424];  and (2) compare 
the effectiveness of the Chronic Pain Self -Management Program (CPSMP), cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pa in (pain -CBT), and no 
behavioral treatment, all within the context of patient- centered collaborative opi[INVESTIGATOR_164846] . The acronym EMPOWER stands for Effective 
Management of Pain and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Free Ways to Enhance Relief. 
 [Please note: Along with the EMPOWER randomized controlled trial, PCORI funded a separate sub -study involving a national observational 
study of people taking daily prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (not tapering). As this observational sub- study was not part of the randomized controlled trial, 
it is not described in this protocol.]

Study Goals and Objectives  
 
Aim 1: Reduce or Contain Prescription Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187427].  
Hypothesis 1a . At one year, 40% of participants in the Taper Only group (no behavioral treatment) will successfully reduce prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_187428] ≥50% in MEDD without worsening pain intensity, pain interference, or satisfaction with social roles and activities at 12 months. 
Hypothesis 1b . Success with patient- centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187429] . 
 
Aim 2: Compare the Effectiveness of (1) Taper + CPSMP, or (2) Taper + pain -CBT, or (3) No Behavioral Treatment (Taper Only) within 
the Context of Patient- Centered Collaborative Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187430].  
Hypothesis 2a . Participants receiving behavioral interventions (Taper + pain- CBT or Taper + CPSMP) will be more likely to reduce their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_187431] (no behavioral intervention).  
Hypothesis 2b . There will be no significant differences in dosage reduction or the percentage of participants reducing dosage between the 
Taper + pain -CBT and Taper + CPSMP groups.  
Hypothesis 2c . Participants in the Taper + pain -CBT group will experience less pain, less pain interference, and decreased depression 
compared to those in the Taper + CPSMP or Taper Only groups.  
Hypothesis 2d.  Participants in the Taper + CPSMP group will show greater improvements in satisfaction with social roles and activities 
and self -efficacy compared to those in the Taper + pain -CBT or Taper Only groups.  
 Exploratory Hypothesis 2e . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187432] (Taper + pain -
CBT or Taper + CPSMP) compared to those in the Taper Only group.  
 
Study Design  
 
This is a pragmatic,  prospective , longitudinal, multi -center, three- arm, randomized controlled clinical trial. The study will include  594 
patients receiving daily prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_187433] (see Table [ADDRESS_221246] of study 
locations ).

 Methodology  
 At all sites, patient recruitment will occur through the following methods: identifying eligibility in medical records, in -house advertising, 
external community -based advertising, and use of the CHOIR database at Stanford University .
[ADDRESS_221247].  Clinicians will 
discuss EMPOWER with patients and obtain permission from interested pati ents to be contact[CONTACT_66696]. Study coordinators will 
then obtain informed consent and register participants in the CHOIR research learning health system database to initiate surv ey 
deployment. After completing the baseline survey, participants will  be randomized to one of three intervention  arms: (1) EMPOWER 
Taper Only (no behavioral treatment); (2) EMPOWER Taper + pain -CBT; or (3) EMPOWER Taper + CPSMP. Block  randomization with 
variable block sizes , stratified by [CONTACT_3885] , will be utilized.  The Executive Research Team, including the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_187434], will remain masked to intervention assignment throughout recruitment, enrollment, and data collection. Participants, 
EMPOWER clinicians, and study coordinators will be  aware of intervention  assignment. For the study flow diagram, see Figure 1 .

Eligibility Criteria.  Inclusion criteria are: adults aged  18–85 years , diagnosed with chronic non -cancer pain ( lasting at least six  months ), 
and actively taking prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ( at least  10 MEDD) for at least three  months at any of our seven study sites. Eligibility will not be 
restricted to specific pain conditions . Exclusion criteria include: clinician -determined moderate or severe opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) as 
defined by a brief screening tool ;2 inability  to provide informed consent; inability  to meaningfully participate in group interventions  (e.g., 
due to cognitive impairment or lack of English fluency); or known disruptive behavior that could interfere with the group learning 
experience and treatment outcomes  for the cohor t. Patients with moderate to severe OUD will be referred for addictionology consult or 
triaged per local systems.  
 
Patients with active substance use disorder ( SUD ) may enroll and  local  systems will refer  them  for SUD evaluation and treatment as 
clinically indicated. No special vulnerable populations will be recruited (e.g., children  or patients pregnant at the time of enrollment). All 
research procedures will take place at the seven clinical sites, with data collection and some treatment  elements  occurring online . 
 
Consent Procedures . Electronic consent will be administered through CHOIR1 following completion of the screening visit. Participants 
will provide consent by [CONTACT_187498]. A copy of the consent form will be securely emailed to the p articipant. Two study sites (Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care 
System and Kaiser Permanente Oakland) will administer consent locally . 
 Participant Compensation . Participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_221248] code for completing assessments at baseline, month 6, and 
month 12, and $5 for completing weekly surveys from weeks 1–24 and monthly surveys from months 7 –11 (29 total surveys).Total 
possible compensation for study participation is $220. F or participants who do not complete their [ADDRESS_221249] attempts made by [CONTACT_187499] $[ADDRESS_221250] survey.   
 Learning Health System and Informatics Platform . CHOIR  (https://choir.stanford.edu/ ) i
s an electronic informatics platform that serves 
multiple study functions .1 It is a secure (password -protected), HIPAA -compliant platform hosted by [CONTACT_187500] . CHOIR will collect patient- reported data at each time point using surveys tailored to the study and will be standardized across 
all study sites. Additional CHOIR functions include obtaining online consent, automated post -enrollment randomization, deployment of 
tailored surveys based on treatment arm assignment, a patient- reported outcomes data system that minimizes response burden using 
computer adaptive testing for NIH PROMIS measures , a centralized study database, an automated electronic payment system for survey 
completion, real -time display of patient progress for study clinicians, generation of personalized opi[INVESTIGATOR_187435], monitoring for 
patient adverse events, and deployment of alerts to various stakeholders to address patient risks, minimize missing data, and manage 
participant payments. Clinicians will be able to  view individual patient progress and longitudinal data in real ti me. Paper surveys will be 
mailed to participants  who lack access to email, computers, or smartphones , and study staff will input  the data into the electronic database. 

 
5   
Weekly CHOIR surveys : All patients will receive weekly CHOIR e -surveys via email to assess taper discomfort symptoms or other issues , 
with the explicit purpose of informing  clinical care, symptom triage, and any necessary adjustments  to their taper plan. Taper -related 
symptoms of moderate severity will trigger an automated e -alert to the prescriber, study site director, site coordinator, and study manager. 
Patients will also receive automated  e-response messages with recommended actions, such as  calling the clinic for telephone triage or 
scheduling an in-clinic visit. At each follow -up visit, taper discomfort symptoms will be reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_187501]. Moderate and severe symptoms will be reported to the local IRB , the Data Safety and 
Monitoring Board (DSMB ), and the study sponsor . 
 
Monthly CHOIR surveys : Patients will be assessed monthly for satisfaction with the study, current opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187436], depressive symptoms, suicidality, and other factors that may indicate symptom worsening and require follow -up. 
Suicidality will trigger e -alerts to the prescribing clinician, site director, site coordinator, study manager, and the overall principal 
investigator. Site -specific messages will provide patients  with instructions for non -emergency triage (e.g., callin g the clinic for telephone 
or in-person follow -up) and emergency triage options in their community (e.g., calling 911), rapid contact [CONTACT_187502], and crisis 
hotlines .  
 
Weekly and monthly surveys will ensure  careful monitoring of patients, triage of issues , and close connections with study staff and 
prescribing providers to enable rapid taper adjustments  and address any additional needs. Study clinicians may securely access 
EMPOWER CHOIR via a web browser to review patient responses and coordinate participant activities. Comprehensive  patient -reported 
survey batteries will be administered at baseline  and at six  and [ADDRESS_221251] a site -specific randomized controlled trial using a randomized design , allowing rapid accrual of 
patient cohorts (N=8 –18 per cohort) assigned to the same intervention arm and timely delivery of behavioral interventions . Patients 
entering  the study will be automatically assigned to the currently open intervention arm. The ordering of intervention arms will remain 
blinded to patients and clinicians, who cannot  choose or direct group assignment. Study coordinators , while  unblinded, will be  trained to 
maintain clinician and patient blind ing. After enrollment and baseline measures, group assignments  will be revealed to participants. A 
statistician unaffiliated with patient care will create unique  randomization schemes for each site, enabling prompt  receipt of behavioral 
interventions  for those  assigned to such arms (ideally within two  to ten weeks of taper initiation). Behavioral intervention timing will be 
recorded . 
 Study Outcomes  
Primary Outcome (Aim 1) – Taper Success at 12 months  
Taper success will be defined as a ≥50% reduction in MEDD from baseline to 12 months without significant pain intensity increase (≤1-
point increase) or no opi[INVESTIGATOR_187437] (≥2 -point decrease in pain intensity).  Please see Appendix A, Data 
Measurement Plan , for more details.  
 Secondary Outcomes (Aim 2) – Pain Characteristics for the Three Intervention Arms at 12 months  
Taper success (MEDD and pain intensity), pain interference, pain self -efficacy, and depression and satisfaction with social roles and 
activities will be assessed (for more details, see Appendix A). Specifically, depression and satisfaction with social role s and activities will 
be assessed using National Institutes of Health PROMIS short -form measures which are commonly used in pain research. These  domains 
were identified by [CONTACT_7902], Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials as co re outcomes .
3,4 Web-based 
PROMIS assessment center software will calculate short -form T scores using Item Response Theory scoring algorithms that apply the 
Bayesian expected a posteriori method.   
 EMPOWER Patient -Centered Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187438] ( received by [CONTACT_187503]) . Following study enrollment, all participants will engage 
with their EMPOWER clinician in a patient -centered prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_187439]. All opi[INVESTIGATOR_187440]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187441]’s electronic medical record. All aspects of 
tapering will be individualized, including the timing of taper initiation, the dose reduction goal (set collaborati vely with the patient), and 
the pace of the taper. The basic patient -centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187442].
5 Importantly, 
complete opi[INVESTIGATOR_187443] a goal if the patient chooses it. The recommended  taper speed will be a 5% reduction of the starting 
dose, with one dose decrease per month until the patient is stable, without physical discomfort or psychological distress. Patients will be 
assessed at each visit; dose decreases or increases in  taper speed will only occur after consultation with and consent from the patient . 
Patients will have the choice to set  the pace of their taper, pause their taper, or withdraw from the  taper or the study at any time. The taper 
will not be unidirectional: EMPOWER will not restrict  needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_187444]. Participation in the study will not prevent patients from receiving any needed medical care. Patients will not be remo ved from the 
study if they increase their opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533]; on the contrary, we will seek to follow  these patients to understand their experiences, responses, 
and unmet treatment needs . 
 
Clinicians may use the electronic CHOIR opi[INVESTIGATOR_187445] a taper schedule that remains  flexible based on patient responses  to 
prior dose reductions . Micro -dose reductions will be recommended for the first few decrements, followed by  [CONTACT_187504] , 
not exceeding a  10% opi[INVESTIGATOR_187446]. Recommendations  will include tapering one opi[INVESTIGATOR_187447] a time and avoiding 
 
6  concurrent tapering of other medications . Participants will receive in -person or online medical follow -ups with their EMPOWER clinician 
approximately  every three to four weeks. Participants will complete weekly and monthly CHOIR symptom surveys , which  will be 
reviewed during  medical follow -ups to determine whether reported withdrawal symptoms are related to the taper or are unrelated (e.g., 
seasonal allergies). If CHOIR detects severe or worsening  symptoms indicative of participant struggle or deterioration, immediate (real-
time) electronic alerts  will be sent to the participant, clinic, and prescribing clinician , with follow -up actions based  on symptom severity.  
 
The study protocol will encourage the use of adjuvants within the scope of normal clinical practice and training and will not restrict  other 
analgesic prescribing, such as initiating  SNRI medications . The protocol will provide guidance on reducing short - and long- acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_187448] a time. Concurrent  tapering of other medications will be discouraged .  
 
The EMPOWER taper program may only be administered by a prescriber clinician trained in EMPOWER methods . 
 
CHOIR Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187449] . EMPOWER will include an electronic taper calculator  allowing  clinicians to input the patient’s current dose, 
number of daily doses, desired taper timeframe, taper goal, and taper pace. The tool will generate  precise guidance for doses/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187450]. Because the taper will be flexible, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187451] a patient’s 
taper plan based on new circumstances, such as a desired taper pause or a patient’s request  to adjust  the taper speed .  
 
Study  Arms 
(1) EMPOWER Taper + Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (pain -CBT).[ADDRESS_221252] manual and corresponding patient workbook were developed for the EMPOWER study (EMPOWER CBT). A relaxation 
MP3 audio file accompanies the patient workbook. Consistent with general pain -CBT, the EMPOWER CBT protocol includes in teractive 
discussion, pain education, relaxation training practice, goal setting, cognitive restructuring, problem -solving, and action planning, with 
home exercises incorporated into each session . Participants will learn to effectively manage their pain and symptoms while working 
towards achieving the goals that matter to them. A mental health will deliver the eight -week group intervention to cohorts of patients 
(N=8 –18) assigned to this arm. Intervention sessions will be delivered weekly and last two hours. To ensure consistency across all  study 
sites and cohorts, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187452] -session CBT protocol, with competency assured by [CONTACT_135025]. Heather 
King. The structured format of the CBT intervention ensures treatment fidelity,  with the trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187453] (for 
didactic content), corresponding worksheets from the participant workbook, and optional reading from an additional book. The study 
coordinator will be present at each treatment session and facilitat e intervention fidelity by [CONTACT_187505], including the relaxation audio. Participants assigned to this intervention arm will not receive CPSMP during the s tudy period. 
No other aspects of pain care will be constrained.  
 
(2) EMPOWER Taper + The Chronic Pain Self -Management Program (CPSMP).10-11 CPSMP is  an evidence -based behavioral 
treatment delivered by [CONTACT_187506] -leaders with lived experience in successful pain self -management. 
Certification as a CPSMP leader requires 24 hours of training over four days. The CPSMP manualized protocol includes patient education about pain and strategies for effective self -management of pain, its impacts, and other symptoms . Based on self -efficacy theory,  CPSMP is 
delivered in six weekly 2.5- hour group sessions to cohorts of 8– [ADDRESS_221253] anning, and home exercises 
into each session. Patients learn to live better with chronic pain by [CONTACT_187507] f unction. 
Participants assigned to this arm will not receive group pain -CBT during the study period. No other aspects of pain care will be 
constrained, including individual psychological treatment; receipt of non- study treatments will be tracked . 
Prior research has shown that pain -CBT and CPSMP have both shared and distinct effects, suggesting some individuals may respond 
better to one treatment than the other. However, no evidence currently exists to guide a best -practice choice between the two. W hile pain -
CBT and CPSMP are both effective for chronic pain, they have not been tested within an active opi[INVESTIGATOR_187454].  We hypothesize 
that these behavioral interventions  will help patients reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_187455], manage pain, and restore function in ways 
superior to opi[INVESTIGATOR_187456] . 
  
(3) EMPOWER Taper Only (usual care). Participants assigned to this intervention  arm will participate in the voluntary EMPOWER 
patient- centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187457]- CBT or CPSMP during the 12- month study period. No other 
aspects of pain care will be  constrained.  
 
Virtual Format for Behavioral Treatment Groups  
Background: In March 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic led to social distancing safety requirements, which prevented the continuation of in-
person delivery of our behavioral treatment groups. In response, with PCORI approval, we demonstrated the feasibility of virtual groups by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_28882] a virtual option with participants who were already enrolled in the study (i.e. enrolled prior to 03/26/2020). We no w offer virtual 
(live, online) delivery of our behavioral treatment groups as another option for all participants including new enrollments.  Due to ongoing 
and unpredictable COVID -[ADDRESS_221254].  
 
7   
Content : Virtual pain -CBT and CPSMP treatments are delivered exactly as outlined in the protocol where the same content and materials 
(e.g., participant workbooks, presentation slides, e tc.) by [CONTACT_187508]. The only difference between virtual and in -
person is the video format in the virtual groups and materials are distributed via traditional mail instead.  
 
Platform  – Each site delivers the virtual treatments using a HIPAA compliant and secured platform endorsed by [CONTACT_187509] 
(Zoom at Stanford and Colorado, VA Video Connect at the Phoenix VA, and WebEx at Intermountain Health). The platforms are bro adly 
utilized for telehealth at the sites.  
 
Facilitator Training  – To assure high -quality and standardized delivery, the facilitators who conduct the in -person groups at each site, are 
also the same facilitators delivering the virtual treatments. Additionally, we centralized our virtual system across Stanford  Pain, Sta nford 
Primary Care and Colorado where we have Stanford psychologists (or Telligen peer leaders) leading a cohort comprised of both Stanford 
and Colorado participants. As closed payer systems, Phoenix VA and Intermountain Health do not permit external services. The facilitators 
practiced delivering the programs on the virtual platform up to three times before the start of the first series.  
 
Participant Training  – The facilitators, study coordinators, and the core manager collaborated in developi[INVESTIGATOR_187458]. Before the first session, the local study coordinator conducts an orientation with each  
participant to review how to use the platform and etiquette expectations (e.g., be situated in a private, quiet place during each session). 
Please see accompanying documents (Study Coordinator Procedures/Script, Group Telehealth Agreem ent, Facilitator Work Flow and 
Guidelines, Welcome to the Group, Welcome Letter, and Zoom Application Instructions).  
 
Patient -Centered Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187430] (taper -only, no behavioral treatment)  
Virtual Format - Each recruitment site enhanced their clinic schedules to make virtual medical visits more accessible to patients at the onset  
of the COVID -[ADDRESS_221255] (IRB).  The study will adhere to  the common protocol and procedures approved by [CONTACT_187510].  
 Sample Size Calculations and Study Power  
 
The power calculation is primarily based on the study aims for comparative effectiveness . The original power calculation was for N = 850 , 
with N = 750 patients completing the month -12 survey.  The study sample size was later reduced to N = 489 participants completing the 
month- 12 survey (n = 163  patients per intervention  arm on average). As a result, the study's power is lower than initially planned but 
remains adequate for the objectives, summarized as follows: Hypothesis 1a.  N = 163 Taper Only participants provide 80% power to confirm that the taper success rate is above 40% at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05, when the true success rate is 51.5%.  
Hypothesis 1b . Comparing the taper success rate between n = 140 Taper Only participants with an initial dose < 200 MEDD and n = 23 
Taper Only participants with an initial dose ≥ 200 MEDD, the expected 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in success rates 
is [-22%, 22%], assuming a true taper success rate of 50% independent of the initial dose. The width of the CI increases by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 24% due 
to the  sample size reduction.    
Hypothesis 2a . N = 163 participants per intervention  arm provide 80% power for detecting a taper success rate difference of 40% versus 
53.5% at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  
Hypothesis 2b.  N = 163 participants per intervention  arm yield an expected 95% CI of [ -11%, 11%] for estimating the difference in taper 
success rates between the Taper + pain -CBT and Taper + CPSMP arms, assuming a taper success rate of  50% in both arms.  
Hypothesis 2c and 2d.  N = 163 participants per intervention  arm provide 80% power to detect  a between -group difference of 0.[ADDRESS_221256] at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  
 We also assume an annual drop off rate is less than 19% and we will include all drop outs in our ITT analyses. We will enroll a total of 594 
patients to assure the minimum group size requirements for analysis of comparative effectiveness.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Aim 1 : Reduce or contain prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_187424].  
Hypothesis 1a : We will estimate the proportion of patients achieving  patient- centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187459]  40% (treatment success estimate derived from Darnall et al.5). We will estimate the binomial proportion of patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_187460] 40%.  
Hypothesis 1b : We will compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_187461]: Low (10 –49 
MEDD), Moderate (50 –89 MEDD), High (90 –199 MEDD) and Super -High ( ≥200 MEDD).  
 
 
8  Aim 2 : Examine the balance  in key patient characteristics such as initial opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], pain intensity , and functional measures separately for 
the three  interventions  arms. We will use  Chi-square or Fisher's exact test s to compare success rates between opi[INVESTIGATOR_187462].  
Hypothesis 2a : We will compare the intervention  success rate of 500 patients in behavior al intervention  arms  (pain -CBT and CPSMP) with 
250 patients receiving patient -centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187463] (no behavioral intervention ; Taper Only). We will use a Chi-square test to 
compare the success rate between group s. We will apply logistic regression to adjust for baseline covariates.  
Hypothesis 2b : We will estimate the difference in intervention  success rates between pain -CBT and CPSMP arms using a n intent ion-to-
treat procedure  and construct 95% CIs for the difference .  
Hypothesis 2c : We will compare changes in pain intensity, pain interference , and depression scores (baseline to 12 months) between the 
pain-CBT and Taper Only as well as between the pain-CBT and CPSMP arms using two -sample t -tests. We will apply an  analysis of 
covariance based on multiple regression to adjust for baseline covariates.  
Hypothesis 2d . We will compare improvement s in satisfaction with social roles  and activities,  and self -efficacy for Taper + CPSMP against 
Taper + pain -CBT and Taper Only.  
 
We will compare the intervention success rate between participants who received the behavioral interventions with participants who 
received Taper Only using Fisher’s exact test. The difference in success rates between Taper + pain -CBT and Taper + CPSMP w ill be  
assessed with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to determine equivalence. Secondary outcomes —including pain intensity, pain interference, 
depression, self -efficacy, and satisfaction with roles and activities —will be  compared between Taper + pain -CBT and Taper Only and 
betwee n Taper + pain- CBT and Taper + CPSMP at months 6 and 12 using mixed effects model for repeated measurements regression. 
This analysis  will incorporate baseline, month 6, and month 12 outcomes as dependent variables, with an unstructured variance –covariance 
matrix for within -subject correlations.   
 Exploratory Hypothesis 2e:  We will separately estimate the probability of opi[INVESTIGATOR_187464] (pain -CBT, CPSMP and 
Taper Only).  
 
For exploratory hypotheses, the probabilities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_187465] w ill be  estimated and compared with Fisher’s exact 
test. Post -hoc analyses will use logistic regression to examine associations between baseline characteristics and tapering success. There is 
no correction for multiple comparisons. Heterogeneity of treatment effects w ill be  explored by [CONTACT_187511]. Logistic regression with lasso regularization will identify  baseline features predicting tapering success in 
each int ervention group. These models will be  applied to testing sets to identify the subgroup with the highest predicted success under 
Taper + pain -CBT, and success rates w ill be  compared across intervention arms within the subgroup. Intervention effects will be also 
estimated in predefined subgroups.   
 
Heterogeneity of treatment effects will be explored for each intervention  arm considering gender, age, race, initial opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], baseline 
depression, and anxiety level. 
 Access and Intervention Participation.  The comparison across interventions  will be performed according to the intent ion-to-treat principle. 
Additional comparisons based on  the actual intervention  received will be conducted as a sensitivity analysis. We will also study the effect 
of intervention  participation and on treatment outcomes . To this end, we will perform regression analyses to examine the association 
between  the success rate for opi[INVESTIGATOR_187466]- CBT and CPSMP arms, separately, 
while adjusting for identified confounding factors affecting compliance. We will also investigate how baseline factors , such as 
socioeconomic  status , affect the level of compliance .  
 
Virtual Behavioral Treatment Groups:  Comparison of participants who receive in person vs. virtual treatment  - We will examine mode of 
delivery as a potential covariate in our analytic models, and study statistician Lu Tian will both advise and implement. Outside of this issue of treatment delivery mode, we must also recognize that COVID itself has introduced a new variable in the study. We will be examining COVID impacts, as well. In regards to the group size and effectiveness of the intervention, the size of the virtual groups are comparable to 
the size of the in person groups where most groups have an average size of 4 participants. Facilitators stated larger groups (more than 4

chance to go into more detail regarding the skills they are learning and using and any barriers that arise.   
 
Sensitivity Analysis.  We will perform sensitivity analyses to account for missing data and non -completion of  behavioral  interventions . In 
addition, we will consider an alternative definition of t aper success , replacing the 50% reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_187467] a 30% reduction in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533] . A 30% change has been cited as a benchmark for a moderately clinically important difference in the chronic pain literature. 
Similar  analyses will be conducted  with this new endpoint as part of  the sensitivity analyses . 
 
Statistical analysis will be completed using SAS Enterprise Guide Version 8.[ADDRESS_221257] along with the site co -investigators (Drs. De Bruyne, Edelson, Flood, Kim, 
Mackey, Mardian, Moore, Nicholson, and Porter). Luzmercy Perez serve s as the project manager. Additional study staff include Corinne Jung, 
 
[ADDRESS_221258] status and adherence to the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan.  
 
Ethics  
As detailed in the Safety Considerations section, ethical considerations include the potential (though unlikely) discomfort w hen completing 
surveys. This is addressed by [CONTACT_187512]. For increased withdrawal symptoms, a plan to triage participant needs has been 
outlined .

[ADDRESS_221262] UNIVERSITY   Research Consent Form  
Protocol Director:    [CONTACT_187528]:   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187474] a study for people who want to use less or no opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. A health care professional will 
help everyone slowly taper their opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. You will have a say in the speed of the taper. The 
EMPOWER study is funded by [CONTACT_33230] -Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI, 
https://www.pcori.org/) 
In addition to tapering, everyone will be randomized to either:  
• Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain  
• Chronic Pain Self -Management Program 
• No education for the first year (after that you can choose to attend either program)  
Both of the study treatment classes have been shown to help people with chronic pain live 
better lives,  and have more control over their pain and symptoms.  
 
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH  
You are invited to participate in a research study of the effectiveness of the Chronic Pain Self -
Management Program (CPSMP), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for chronic pain (pain- CBT), and 
no behavioral treatment within the context of patient- centered collaborative opi[INVESTIGATOR_187475] 
(PCOT). We hope to learn effectiveness of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187476]. You were selected as a possible participant in this study 
because you have experienced chronic pain and are interested in reducing your prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  
 
If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, you should notify the research team 
at (650) 724- 9319.  
 
This research study is looking for [ADDRESS_221263] a total of 12 months. Participants will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires lasting IRB Use Only  
Approval Date:   March 22, 2022 
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952]: March 22, [ADDRESS_221264]. Beth Darnall and her research study staff will ask you to 
participate in the following steps.  
Step 1: Eligibility Visit 
The first step is to confirm your eligibility with the research team. This is to make sure you are 
a good fit for the stud y. Once your eligibility is confirmed and you have signed this consent, 
you will  be asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires assessing medication use, pain and 
symptoms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_90359], mood, sleep, general health and well -being, and psychological 
traits. This set of questionnaires take approximately 30- 60 mins to complete.  
At this visit, we will also mark the launch of the brief weekly questionnaires (e.g., 12 items). 
The weekly questionnaires will be administered weekly for the first 6 months of study 
participation and will include assessments of patient symptoms, satisfaction, and side effects 
of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187477]. For the final 6 months of participation we will send out monthly 
questionnaires similar in nature and content to the weekly questionnaire. All questionnaires will be 
administered online to reduce participant burden.  
Step 2: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187478] a patient- centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187479]. Duration of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187480] [ADDRESS_221265] comfortable dose for each patient with patients informing 
the pace of opi[INVESTIGATOR_187481].  
Step 3: Intervention  
Roughly 2 -6 weeks following step 1, you may be randomly assigned to one of the following 
groups. Your chance of receiving each intervention is random and determined by a number of 
factors.  
1. Pain-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (pain -CBT+PCOT)  
A trained psychologist delivers pain -CBT to groups of patients. Group treatment is 
delivered across [ADDRESS_221266] for 2 hours each. Pain - CBT incorporates 
interactive discussion, practice of relaxation training, action planning, and home 
exercises into each session. Pain -CBT is effective for reducing pain intensity, pain 
catastrophizing, depression and social impacts.  
 
13  2. Chronic Pain Self -Management Program (CPSMP+PCOT)  
The CPSMP is delivered by 2 trained peers who are certified CPSMP leaders. The CPSMP 
consists of six weekly 2- hour group sessions in which two peer co -leaders provide 
patient education about pain, effective self -management, pain impacts, and other 
symptoms  from a highly structured manual. CPSMP incorporates interactive discussion, 
practice of relaxation training, action planning, and home exercises into each session.  
3. Patient -Centered Opi[INVESTIGATOR_187438] (PCOT)  
Participants allocated to this arm will engage in a physician -guided, patient -centered 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_187482].  
Step 4: Follow -up questionnaires  
6 and 12 months following enrollment you will be asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires 
similar to those completed in step 1. They will assess medication use, pain and symptoms, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_90359], mood, sleep, general health and well -being, and psyc hological traits. This 
set of questionnaires take approximately 30- 60 mins to complete.  
Longitudinal Arm:  
If you are not interested in participating in the interventions or reducing your current 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_187483] a 12- month observational arm of the study. You will be asked to complete a 
batter y of questionnaires at baseline, [ADDRESS_221267] accept the risk that pregnancy 
could still result despi[INVESTIGATOR_187484]. You agree to 
notify the investigator as soon as possible of any  failure of proper use of your birth control 
method, or if you become pregnant, either of which may result in your being withdrawn from 
the study.  
PARTICIPANT RESPONSIBILITIES  
As a participant, your responsibilities include:  
• Follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.  
 
14  • Keep your study appointments. If it is necessary to miss an appointment, please contact 
[CONTACT_187515].  
• Tell the Protocol Director or research study staff about any side effects, doctor visits, or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187485].  
• Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you believe you might be pregnant or 
gotten your partner pregnant.  
• Complete your questionnaires as instructed.  
• Ask questions as you think of them.  
• Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the 
study.  
 
WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY 
If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your 
consent and discontinue your participation at any time. Your decision will not affect your 
ability to receive medical care for your disease and you will not lose  any benefits to which you 
would otherwise be entitled.  
 
If you decide to withdraw your consent to participate in this study, you should notify the 
research team at (650) 724- 9319.  
 
The Protocol Director may also withdraw you from the study without your consent for one or 
more of the following reasons:  
• Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff.  
• The Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful to you.  
• Pregnancy  
• You need treatment not allowed in the study.  
• The study is cancelled.  
• Other administrative reasons.  
• Unanticipated circumstances.  
 
POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES  
There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study. These 
deserve careful thought. You should talk with the Protocol Director, [CONTACT_187529], if you 
have any questions.  
• Patients who enter the study and engage in patient -centered opi[INVESTIGATOR_187486]/or distressing opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801] 
(e.g., drug craving, anxiety, insomnia, increased pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, 
mydri asis, tremor, tachycardia, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657]). Our study is designed to mitigate these 
negative symptoms by [CONTACT_187516] a very slow rate and at the patient ’s pace.  
• Patients may experience anxiety, mood changes, or greater pain with opi[INVESTIGATOR_187487], 
though patients may experience these symptoms as a consequence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], as 
well. 
 
15  • A financial burden may be imposed in the form of copayments if randomization 
procedures allocate the patient to pain -CBT. 
• There is a low risk that patients may experience discomfort in the group treatment 
related to content or group discussions, or interpersonal interactions.  
• There is a risk you may feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions on the 
questionnaires. You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions.  
Additional Risks  
• You may be inconvenienced due to being assigned to a treatment that is not your first 
choice, or to the PCOT taper only.  
• Traveling may be a possible inconvenience. There are multiple sessions involved in each 
intervention.  
• Part of our screening process involves asking about illegal drug use. The responses to 
questions concerning illegal drug use could be self -incriminating and harmful to you if 
they became known outside the study. As explained in the confidentiality statement of 
the consent, we do not intend to disclose this information.  
• It is possible that based on information gained from this study, the researchers may 
have serious concerns (relating to matters such as severe depression, physical abuse, etc.) about your health and/or safety; in such a case, the researchers may contact [CONTACT_187517] a referral for your care. Additionally, the researchers may be required to report information (e.g., infor mation relating to suicide, physical or sexual abuse) to the 
appropriate authorities.  
POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_187488], depression, and disability. Participants 
enrolled in the study may decrease their opi[INVESTIGATOR_187489], depression, and disability. Patients may also reduce their pain as a result of 
the interventions.  
We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  
ALTERNATIVES  
Alternatives to tapering include switching medication class or maintaining current dose. The 
study does not constrain prescribing of any other medications while engaging in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187490]. As such, participants are free to explore any alternative procedures or standard courses 
of treatments while participating in the study.  
PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS  
You should not feel obligated to agree to participate. Your questions should be answered 
clearly and to your satisfaction. If you decide not to participate, tell the Protocol Director. 
You will be told of any important new information that is learned during the course of this 
research study, which might affect your condition or your willingness to continue participation 
in this study.

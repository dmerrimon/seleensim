1. Introduction  
 
1.[ADDRESS_692254]  
 
Headache is a common complaint in the reproductive population  with 16% of women suffering from 
migraine and 88% from tension headache.  In the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB) Maternal 
Emergency Unit (MEU) (analogous to obstetric triage units at other centers), 19-26 patients from 
September -November 2 018 presented  monthly with the chief complaint of headache . During 
pregnancy the treatment of headache is delayed due to concern for  potential fetal exposure limiting 
treatment  and appropriate workup . Delaying treatment places women at increased risk for worsening 
of headache disorders and developi[INVESTIGATOR_533139] . Improving the treatment of 
headache s has both the potential to improve patient care  and satisfaction, and to reduce progression of 
headache disorders.  
 
Occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533135] (ONB) a re a well -established treatment for tension and migraine headache s 
with both abortive and prophylactic treatment benefits . The use in pregnancy  currently  is limited to 
expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_533140] .  A MEDLINE review using search terms “occipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992]” and 
“pregnancy” yielded [ADDRESS_692255] the central hypothesis that use of  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533141] / Caffeine cocktail for treatment of headache in pregnancy. By 
[CONTACT_533182] -based treatment options for headache in pregnancy , our objective is t o 
provide this at risk population  with improved access to treatment.  To our knowledge, t his study will be 
the first randomized control tr ial addressing the use of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533136] . 
 
 
1.2 Primary H ypothesis  
 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_533142] /Caffeine PO cocktail results in a 
greater proportion of pregnant women with response to treatment, defined  as resolution or headache 
or improvement to mild  severity  (VSR ≤3) at 1 hour after tre atment .  
 
1.3 Secondary Hypotheses  
Compared to women receiving the PO cocktail treatment, women who receive ONB will:  
5 
 
a) Have improved headache pain at 2 hours following treatment  
b) Have a shortened interval to response to treatment   
c) Have improved satisfaction with treatment  
d) Have decreased headache frequency for the 7 days following treatment  
e) Experience no difference in the development of hypertensive disease of pregnancy at 7 days 
following treatment  
f) Have less utilization of crossover treatment  
g) have no difference in the development of hypertensive disease of pregnancy at 28 days 
following treatment  
h) Have  decreased utilization of MEU services in the next 28 days  
i) Have a great er improvement in pain scores

2. Background  
 
2.1 Introduction  
 
Headache is a common complaint in the reproductive population. Primary headache disorders  include 
migraine , cluster, and tension headache.  Of reproductive age women, 1/6 suffer from migraine and 88% 
meet criteria for tension headache  at some point in their life .1,2  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_533143],  primary headache disorders can initially present , worsen,  
or be diagnosed during pregnancy.3 The d iagnosis and treatment of acute headache in pregnancy is of 
great importance as it can dictate delivery and early maternal/feta l interventions.   
 
During pregnancy the treatment of headache is made more difficult due to an increase in secondary 
headaches, such as pre -eclampsia, and concern for potential fetal exposure limiting treatment.[ADDRESS_692257] ion, and disease progression of headache disorders.  
 
Occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533135] (ONB) are a well -established treatment for tension and migraine headache  in 
the non -pregnant population  with both abortive and prophylactic treatment benefits .7-[ADDRESS_692258]  efficacy and 
safety in the pregnant population.15  Complications of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533144].  A MEDLINE review using search terms “occipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992]” and “pregnancy” yielded [ADDRESS_692259] improved access to treatment.  
 
Figure 1: Site of injection of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992]13 
 
 

[ADDRESS_692260] line treatment varies  wide ly by 
[CONTACT_533183].  
 
There is level A evidence for the use  of acetaminophen, acetaminophen/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/caffeine  (Excedrin 
Migraine ®), and buto rphanol for treatment of acute headache that are all safe for use during 
pregnancy.16,[ADDRESS_692261] trimester.18 As a result many 
providers  favor the use of acetaminophen/buta lbital/caffeine  (Fioricet®) despi[INVESTIGATOR_533145] A 
or Level B evidence for the use of butalbital containing medications  for treatment of headache . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_533146] a Level A treatment for acute headache use in pregnancy is again limited by  [CONTACT_533184]. Ketoralac, naproxen and ibuprofen are also FDA level A and can be safely used prior to 28 
weeks for 48 -72 hours. However, the potential risk of  premature  closure of the ductus arteriosus, 
platelet dysfunction, and/or fetal and maternal r enal dysfunction limit  NSAIDS use for treatment of 
headache in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester .17  
 
Level B medications that can be used for the treatment of acute headache in pregnancy are the 
dopamine blockers: chl orpromazine, promethazine, meto clopramide, and prochloperazine.[ADDRESS_692262] 
the added benefit of treatment of nausea. There is also Level B evidence for the use of Codeine in 
combination with acetaminophen and tramadol in combination with acetaminophen, but these are used 
more rarely due to increasing awareness of their potential for maternal opi[INVESTIGATOR_533147] . 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_533148] a common complaint in pregnancy there is no obstetric or neu rologic society 
that has standardized recommendations for treatment of headache in pregnancy  leaving treatment 
provider dependent.    
 
2.3 Safety  and efficacy of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533149], known as occipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992] 
(ONB), is an acute and prophylactic treatment of headache commonly used outside of pregnancy. Five – 
ten cc of local anesthetic with or without steroid is injected into the greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533150]/or lesser 
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533151] 6 -9 weeks  as desired for prophylactic benefit . ONB has been studie d extensively in 
both randomized controlled trails and prospective cohort studies. Randomized control led trials show 
therapeutic benefit with clinically significant reduction in headache ( HA) days in the 1st week, and 2 and 
3 months following ONB.7,9 Retrospective studies has shown benefit of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533152] (cluster, migraine and tension).[ADDRESS_692263]. Current evidence shows that the use of ONB in acute care 
settings is safe with risk of complication being similar to that of any subcutaneous injection.14 Response 
of acute headache to ONB ranges from a 50% pain reduction in pain to 90% resolution at 45 minutes 
after treatment.19,20  
 
8 
 
2.4 Use of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533153] e of ONB has not been studied extensively in pregnancy a case series has been published 
with a population of 13 pregnancies who failed oral and IV treatment of migraine. Of these women, 38% 
suffered from ch ronic  migraine s with 51% suffering from status mig rainosis (migraine lasting >72hrs) at 
the time of injection. Eleven  patients had acute pain relief and resolution. Two  patients had no pain 
relief and went on to be diagnosed with preeclampsia  and no patient s suffer ed from minor or major 
complications .[ADDRESS_692264] research 
addressing the natural course of headache in pregnancy rather than treatment of headache in 
pregnancy . 21,22 There is scant literature addressing the use of ONB  in an emergency department setting  
but the few published studies are promising showing efficacy and safety . 14,15  A MEDLINE review using 
search terms “occ ipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992]” and “pregnancy” yielded 5 results, confirming that there are no 
randomized trials evaluating ONB in pregnancy. Furthermore, clinicaltrials.gov has zero registered trials 
on the topic of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533154]. This innovat ive randomized controlled trail will 
expand the use of evidence -based treatment options for headache in pregnancy leading to improved 
access to evidence based treatment of acute and chronic  headache in pregnancy.  
 
3. Study Design  
 
This is a n open label randomized control led trial evaluating response to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_533155]/Caffeine cocktail in treatment of pregnant patients seeking headache  
treatment . 
 
3.1 Primary Research Question: Is occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533156]/  Caffeine cocktail  
in the treatment of headache in pregnancy ?  Benefit of occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533157] a 
resolution  or improvement of headache pain to mild range (VRS ≤ 3)  at 1 hours by [CONTACT_355875]/verbal rating 
score (VRS).  
 
3.2 Secondary Research Aims:  
a) To assess the difference in response to treatment at 2 hours following treatment.  
9 
 
b) To a ssess the difference in time to resolution of pain after treatment of acute headache 
between groups.  
c) To a ssess patient satisfaction with t reatment  at time of discharge and at 7 days.  
d) To a ssess headache free duration within 7 days after treatment.  
e) To assess the development of hypertensive disease of pregnancy without 7 days after 
treatment.   
f) To assess the need for crossover treatment.  
g) To a ssess development of hypertensive disease of pregnancy  within 28 days of treatment.  
h) To assess the need of MEU services for treatment of headache within 28 days of treatment.  
i) To assess the change in VSR before and after treatment.  
 
3.3 Design Summary : This is an open label randomized control led trial. Women who present to the MEU 
with headache will be a ssessed by [CONTACT_533185]/or OB/GYN residents. If the woman 
meets criteria for the study she will be enrolled by [CONTACT_533186].   
 
See Figure 2 for the flow diagram depi[INVESTIGATOR_533158]’s course through MEU. If eligible for inclusion, 
women will be randomly assigned to ONB or headache cocktail. Randomization  will occur at time of 
enrollment . Prior to headach e treatment 10-point  visual/ verbal rating scale (VRS) will be obtained .  
Treatment time is defined as time the patient takes the medication  or the time that the needle is 
inserted into the greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533159]. At 60 min after treatment VRS will again b e obtained  by 
[CONTACT_533187] . If headache pain is resolved , defined as a VRS 0, the  patient will be 
discharge d to home  (at the discretion of the managing team provid ed there are no other indications for 
further observation or admission) . If pain continues to be present VRS will again be a ssessed at 120 min 
after treatment. If pain is not improved  to mild range, defined as a VRS ≤ 3,  or resolved , crossover 
treatment will be given. VRS will be obtained at 60 min after cross over treatment ; if pain is resolved 
patient will be discharge to home. I f pain continues to be present VRS will be obtained at 120 min after 
cross over treatment. If pain is not improved to mild pain or resolved ; second line treatment of  
Promethazine 25mg/Benadryl 25mg  will be given. VRS will again be obtained 60 min after second line 
treatment . If pain is not improved to mild  pain (VRS ≤3) or resolved neurology consult will be 
considered. If at any point during treatment the patient develops new neurological symptoms stu dy 
protocol will be stopped and neurology will be consulted.  
 
Patients will be called 7 days after discharge to access short term outcomes ( headache frequency since 
MEU visit , injection site complications,  and satisfaction with treatment .) Patients will a gain be called at 
28 days and a chart abstraction will be done to assess long -term  outcomes ( recurrent presentation for 
headache to the MEU , maternal  complications including preeclampsia,  or fetal complication s).

provided  a copy  of the signed  informed  consent.  The informed  consent  will only  be in English,  and thus,  
only  English -speaking  individuals  may  participate  in the study.  
4. Provider  Training   
4.1 Procedure  Education  
All MEU  providers  will be trained  in ONB  prior  to initiation  of study.  Procedure  methods  used  will be 
those  recomm ended  by [CONTACT_533188] 2013.13 All teaching  will be done  in a single  30min  session  during  resident  
didactics.  Teaching  will be done  by a neurology  trained  provider  with extensive  experience  in ONB.  MEU  
providers  will practice  injections  on models  with  supervision  during  the teaching  session and will be 
signed  off on procedural  technique  at the end of the session.  
4.2 Procedure  Technique  
1. Supply  Preparation:   
a. 10 cc of 0.5%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_533163] a 10 cc syringe  using  a draw  up needle.  
b. A 1.5-2 inch  27 gag needle  will be placed  on the 10 cc syringe.  
c. A second  1.5-2 inch  27 gag needle  will be opened  and ready  for exchange  of needles  
between  injection  sites.   
d. Two  alcohol  swabs  
e. Two  2x2 gauze  or 2 cotton  balls  
2. Positioning:  The patient  will be positioned  in a sitting  position  leaning  forward  with  forehead  
resting  on crossed  arms  over  a table.    
3. Location:  Bilateral  greater  and lesser  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533164] . After  bone y landmarks  have  been  identified , one finger  pressure  will be placed  on 
a unilateral  greater  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533165].  Pressure  will then  be release d. Then , on the same  side using  
one finger  the lesser  occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533166].  The patient  will be asked  which  results  in 
more  pain.  Based  the patient  response  the site of greatest  pain  will be chosen  as the site of 
injection.  Attention  will then  be turned  to the opposite  side and testing  will be repeated.  After  
bilateral  sites  of injection  has been  identified  based  on physical  exam.   Injection  site will be 
recorded.      
12 
 
4. Injection:  Bilateral  sites  will be cleaned  with  an alcohol  swab.  5cc of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_533167]. If a boney  land mark  is 
not hit the need le will be withdrawn  and inserted  superiorly  to ensure  injection  in to supra -ostia  
area . Prior  to injection  the plunger  will be drawing  back  to assess  for vascular  structure.  If there  
is return  of blood  the needle  we removed  and reinserted . The injection  will not be given  until  
there  is no return  of blood  suggesting  vascular  penetration.  After  injection  into unilateral  
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533168] 5cc of 0.5%  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_533169].  
5. Post -injection  care:  After  injections  have  been  completed  the patient  will hold  gauze  or cotton  
balls  on bilateral  injection  site for 2-[ADDRESS_692267]  been  answered . 
5.2 Randomization  
After  the treating  provider  has consented  the patient , she will be randomized . Randomization  will occur  
by a predetermined  computer -generated  block  randomization  scheme  prepared  by a study  statistician  
with  further  stratification  by [CONTACT_533189] d decrease  in headache  frequency  
through  pregnancy .

5.4 Participant  Follow -Up 
Patients  will be called  by [CONTACT_533192] 7 days  and 28 days  after  treatment  to access  satisfaction  with  
treatment.  Patients  will be asked  if on a scale  of 1-10 if they  would  recommend  treatment  to a friend;  
with  [ADDRESS_692268]  and days  headache  free following  treatment.  At 7 days  development  of local  
injection  site reaction  will also be assessed.   At 7 and 28 days  need  for representation  for headache  
treatment  and development  of hypertensive  disease  of pregnancy  will be assessed.   
In additi on investigators  experienced  in abstracting  obstetrical  outcomes  will review  the patient ’s chart  
at [ADDRESS_692269]  (DSMB)  will be formed  and consist  of three  individuals  within  the 
Division  of Maternal -Fetal  Medicine  and Department  of Pediatrics  who  have  no ties to the study  design,  
evaluation  of results  or potential  authorshi p of the manuscript.   The primary  purpose  of the DSMB  will 
be to monitor  patient  safety.  The members  of this board  will be Brian  Smins,  Janeen  Arbuckle,  and 
Rhiannon  Reed .  
The purpose  of the study  is to determine  whether  ONB  is a beneficial  treatment  for headache  in 
pregnancy  in an acute  care  setting . In pregnancy  treatment  of headache  is delayed  due to concern  for 
fetal  exposure  and provider  experience.  As a result  headache  treatment  is not standardized  in 
pregnancy  and varies  widely  based  on provider  com fort and experience . Expanding  the use of ONB  in 
this population  may  lead  to improved  access  to treatment.   
Potential  risks  of ONB  are injection  site infection,  development  of hematoma  and ecchymosis.  The risk 
of infection  is the same  as any subcutaneous  infection.  Risk will be minimized  by [CONTACT_533193].  Sterile  tips will be used  and injecting  needs  will be changed  between  
injections  to further  minimize  risk of injection  site infection.  To reduce  the risk of hematoma  and 
ecchymosis  pressure  will be held  on injection  site for 2-3 min following  injection.     
We define  an adverse  event  as an undesirable  experience  or outcome  occurring  in a research  
participant,  regardless  of whether  participation  in the research  study caused  the event  to occur.   For 
example,  maternal  death  and/or  fetal  demise  are known  risks  of pregnancy,  and while not known  to be 
related  to occipi[INVESTIGATOR_533172] , would  be considered  an adverse  event  if it occurred  during  the study.  All 
serious  adve rse events  will be reported  to the DSMB  and IRB. A serious  adverse  event  will include  the 
following  events , if occurring  within  28 days  of treatment:  
a. Injection site complications:  
a. Infection  
b. Hematoma  
b. Development of hypertensive disease of pregnancy  
16 
 
c. Death  
a. Maternal  
b. Fetal (stillbirth)

5.6.4 Follow -up and Outcome  Ascertainment  Periods  
Response  to treatment  will be ascertained  by [CONTACT_533196] 60 min after  
treatment  and 120 minutes  after  treatment  if headache  is not resolved  or mild  at 60 min.  VRS score  will 
again  be obtained  60 min after  crossover  treatment  and 120 min after  crossover  treatment  if headache  
is not resolved  or is mild . If second  line treatment  is given  VRS will be obtained  60 min after  crossover  
treatment.  Maternal  outcomes  (e.g.  injection  site infection  or development  of pre-eclampsia)  are 
delayed  outcomes  which  will require  review  after  discharge . These  outco mes will be assessed  at 7 and 
28 days  after  treatment  by [CONTACT_533197].

6. Statistical Considerations  
6.[ADDRESS_692274] a difference in secondary outcomes. All sample size and power estimates are based 
on treating a pain improvement as a dichotomous outcome with the endpoint being resolution of pain  or 
improvement in pain to mild severity (VRS ≤3) . The improvement of headache with acetaminophen 
500mg/As pi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 500mg/Caffeine 130mg PO is 50% pain reduction to mild headache at 65min.[ADDRESS_692275] assumed the same or similar 
response to Acetaminophen 650mg/Caffeine 100mg PO cocktail to reduce exposure to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_533173]. We anticipate a 58 -90% reduction following 
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_41992].19,20 Given recent randomized controlled trails evaluating treatment of acute 
headache with ONB showing a response of 90% at 45 min and retrospective studies evalua ting the use 
of ONB in the setting of headache prophylaxis showing a 82% with mild or significant response and 58%  
showing significant response  at [ADDRESS_692276] chosen an  85% response rate to account for this 
variation in results.  We e stimate that a total of 62 women ( 31 ONB  and 31 Acetaminophen/Caffeine ) will 
be sufficient to detect  a difference in headache resolution at 1 hour , with 80% power and  a 5% 
significance level.  To account for a 5% loss to follow up, we will aim to enroll 86 women.  On average 
there are 750 evaluations in the MEU each month with 19 -26 of these patients presenting with the chief 
complaint of headache.  Based on a 25% enrollment rate w e have calculated it will take 16 months to 
complete enrolment.

6.2 Power  for Other  Outcomes  
The sample size of 86 for the primary aim will be sufficient to provide 80% p ower to detect a n absolute 
difference of  30%  between ONB and acetaminophen/caffeine headache cocktail (odds ratio of 4, risk 
ratio of 1.6)  at significance level of 5%.  While this study will not be definitive regarding the potential 
benefits  associated  with ONB for specific headache disorders when compared to 
acetaminophen/caffeine , it will provide important baseline information to power a future randomized 
study evaluating the benefits of ONB for treatment of specific headache disorder in pregnancy . In 
addition we  anticipate we will be underpowered to detect differences  between individual components 
concerning prophylactic benefit of ONB .  
 
6.3 Analysis  Plan  
Data ana lyses will adhere closely to those recommended by [CONTACT_533201].24 Analyses will follow the 
intention to treat principle in which participants will be analyzed in the group to which they were 
randomized, regardless of whether or not they received the assigned intervention.25 
 
6.3.1 Primary analy sis: Descriptive statistics will characterize the group of individuals recruited and 
investigate comparability of the two groups at baseline. Formal statistical testing will be limited to 
selected baseline characteristics considered to be prognostic factor s for the primary outcome such as 
known diagnosis of primary headache disorder and baseline headache severity . The categorical 
prognostic factors will be compared between trial groups by [CONTACT_209566] -square  test of association  or 
Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. The two -group independent t -test and the Mann -Whitney U test , as 
appropriate, will be used to compare quantitative characteristics between the trial groups.  
 
The primary outcome and other categorical secondary outco mes will be compared between 
intervention groups by [CONTACT_209566] -square test. We will use the Breslow -Day test to assess 
homogeneity of the odds ratios across the gestational age categories.   Multivariable logistic regression 
22 
 
models will be used to estim ate treatment effects while adjusting for potential confounders.  
Characteristics that are imbalanced at baseline will be considered as covariates in multivariable models.  
Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated.  Multivariable  modified Poisson 
regression models will be considered to estimated adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_692277] or Mann -Whitney U 
tests (as appropriate) as described above.  Multivariable regression models including imbalanced 
baseline characteristics will be explored to determine estimated treat ment differences while accounting 
for potential covariates.  Estimated beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals will be generated.  
6.[ADDRESS_692278] of care. Therefore, 
no serious or life threatening adverse events are expected. Nonetheless, the following measures will be 
taken to monitor and investigate adverse events:  
1. Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): We have assembled an independent, 
study -specific DSMB composed of three distinguished individuals Brian Smins, Janeen Arbuckle, 
and Rhiannon Reed  who represent appropriate expertise (maternal health, neonatology, clinical 
trials, and biostatistics). They will provide oversight to assure that the trial accrues at a sufficient 
rate and that the safety and privacy of all study participants is assured. Members of the DSMB 
are not involved in any aspect of the trial operation.  The DSMB will be provided progress reports 
and adverse event reports on a monthly basis to review study progress and monitor adverse 
events.  
2. Adverse events reporting: Detailed infor mation concerning adverse events will be collected and 
evaluated throughout the trial. The DSMB will review all Adverse Event Report forms and other 
safety data.

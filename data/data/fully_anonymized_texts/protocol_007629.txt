Objectives The objective of this study is to evaluate the plasma amphetamine concentration/time profile of DYANAVEL XR in preschool children with 
ADHD following a single 1 mL (2.5 mg) dose of DYANAVEL XR. 
Methodology This is a Phase 1, open-label study in children with ADHD to investigate the 
pharmacokinetic profile of DYANAVEL XR over a 28 hour period following the administration of a single dose of 1 mL (2.5 mg) of DYANAVEL XR in children with ADHD. Up to 4 - 6 subjects are planned for enrollment, aged 4 to 
5 years of age at the time of signing of the Informed Consent.   
Subjects will be screened for participation in the study within 6 weeks prior to 
study drug administration.  Medical history, physical examination including 
height and weight, baseline laboratory testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, a dia gnostic assessment using the K-SADS-PL 
to confirm ADHD diagnostic criteria ar e met and informed consent will be 
completed during the screening visit. 
Subjects will be confined from the day of dosing to at least approximately [ADDRESS_583490] will receive a dose of 1 mL (2.5 mg) of DYANAVEL XR, administered by [CONTACT_456576] 0 (Day 1).

Confidential  Page 13 of 46 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Amphetamine has been a well-established therap eutic agent for the tr eatment of Attention 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for decades.  Si nce the original amphetamine approval, various 
dosage forms have been approved for use: 
 Immediate release (IR) dosage forms,  oral solution and tablets.  
 extended release (ER) dosage forms, capsu les, and tablets wi th various release 
technologies 
DYANAVEL XR is an extended-release oral su spension that contains 2.5 mg/mL amphetamine 
base.  Drug-resin complexation is formed w ith the amphetamine and Sodium Polystyrene 
Sulfonate USP, an ion exchange resin. The extended release feature of the product is achieved by 
[CONTACT_456578]/resin complexes with an ex tended-release coating. DYANAVEL XR contains 
approximately a 3.2:1 ratio of d-amphetamine compared to l-amphetamine. 
The efficacy of DYANAVEL XR in the treatment of ADHD in children ages 6-12 has been 
established in a Phase 3 placebo-controlled  laboratory classroo m study: TRI102-ADD-001. 
ADHD symptoms in children on an individually  optimized dose of amphetamine (range 10-20 
mg/day) were significantly lower compared to symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_456579]. Symptom control was demonstrated [ADDRESS_583501] for type frequency and severity of adverse event. 
Study TRI102-PPK-200 was conducted in children ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD to 
evaluate the single-dose (10 mg) pharmacokineti cs of orally administered DYANAVEL XR. 
Following a single 10 mg oral dose of DYANAVEL XR in 12 pediatric subjects under fasting 
conditions, d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine peak plasma concentrations occurred at a median 
time of 3.9 and 4.5 hours after dosing, respectively. The mean plasma terminal elimination half-
life of d-amphetamine was 10.43 (± 2.01 h) hours a nd the mean plasma terminal half-life for l-
amphetamine was 12.14 (± 3.15 h) hours.  
Study 2014-3401 was conducted in 29 healthy adult subjects in a crossover study under fasting 
conditions, following a single, 18.8 mg oral dose of DYANAVEL XR, d-amphetamine and l-
amphetamine, the median (range) time to peak plasma concentrations (T
max) were 4.0 (2 – 7) 
hours after dosing and peak concentration (C max) were 102% and 106%, respectively of the C max 
of immediate-release (IR) mixe d amphetamine salts tablets. The relative bioavailability of 
DYANAVEL XR compared to an equal dose of mixed amphetam ine salts IR tablets is 106% of 
d-amphetamine and 111% for l-amphetamine. 
 
See the DYANAVEL XR Package Insert for further information1. 
The present study will fulfill a part of the Phase [ADDRESS_583502]-marketing studies in children aged 4-5 years with ADHD:

The objective of this study is to  evaluate the plasma amphetamine  concentration/time profile of 
DYANAVEL XR in children aged 4 to 5 years with ADHD following a single 2.5 mg dose of 
DYANAVEL XR. 
These data will guide appropriate dosing in planned safety and efficacy studies with 
DYANAVEL XR in a preschool  population with ADHD. 
 
  
Confidential  Page 16 of 46 3.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is an open-label, single-dose study in 4 -6 pediatric subjects with ADHD and who are 
otherwise healthy. Subjects will receive a si ngle 1 mL dose of DYANA VEL XR (amphetamine) 
Extended-Release oral suspension 2.5 mg/mL. 
Pharmacokinetics will be assessed over a 28 hour period after the single dose.  Subjects may be 
kept at the study s ite(s) overnight. 
Subjects with ADHD aged of 4 to 5 years will be en rolled at up to 2 study sites.  Subjects will be 
screened for participation in the study within 6 weeks before  study drug administration. Medical 
history, physical examination incl uding height and weight, baselin e laboratory testing, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, a structured  diagnostic interview (K-SADS-
PL), and informed consent will be completed during the screening visit. 
All subjects currently taking an ADHD medication including all psychostimulants 
methylphenidate, d-methylphenidate, amphetamines or derivatives of any of these products; must 
not take these medications for [ADDRESS_583503] all other approved daily medications (see concomitant 
medications). 
Subjects will be confined at the study cente r prior to dosing until approximately [ADDRESS_583504] will include peak (maximum) observed plasma drug 
concentration (C max), time to C max (tmax), area under the concentr ation-time curve (AUC) from 
Time [ADDRESS_583505] sampling time (t) with a quantifiable plasma drug concentration (AUC 0–t), AUC 
from Time 0 to infinity (AUC 0–∞), and terminal-phase elimination half-life (t ½). 
3.[ADDRESS_583506]-dose as a primary endpoint; therefore, an open-label, single-dose 
study design will be used. Due to the pharmacokinetic focus of this study, no placebo control 
group will be used.   
One age group of pediatric subjects will be included  in this study. The children will be aged 4 to 
5 years on the day of enrollment into this study. Subjects will receive a 1 mL (2.5 mg) dose of 
DYANAVEL XR. 
Dose Rationale : The dose range of the final optimal dose in a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study of 
DYANAVEL XR in the treatmen t of children aged 6-12 years with ADHD (n=108) (TRI102-
ADD-001) was 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day. None of  the 108 subjects enrolled in that study 
discontinued due to an AE. There were no SAEs , deaths or severe AEs reported. Dosing was 
initiated at 1 to 2 mL (2.5 to 5 mg)/day (inves tigator’s choice) and was titrated in 1 – 4 mL (2.5 
 
  
Confidential  Page 17 of 46 to 10 mg) increments every 4 to 7 days until an optimal dose or the maximum dose (20 mg/day) 
was reached. Subjects had to reach a final optimal  dose between 10 to 20 mg/day, inclusive. No 
subjects discontinued the study due to in ability to tolerate  a 10 mg dose.  
The mean final optimized dose was 15.4 or 0.47 mg / Kg. According to the CDC Growth Chart2, 
the expected weight range with 3rd and 97th percentiles for a pediatric population ages 4 - 6 years 
is 12 – 24 Kg. Considering the low and high end of the weights for children aged 4 to 5 years, a 
single dose of 2.5 mg translat es to a weight-based dose ranging between 0.21 mg/Kg and 0.11 
mg/Kg, less than half of the mean weight-based dose that was well-tolerated in the previous 
study in children aged 6 to 12 y ears. Therefore it can be concl uded that a single 2.5 mg dose of 
DYANAVEL XR is expected to be sa fe and tolerable to pediatric s ubjects aged 4 to 5 years with 
ADHD. 
Meals: The study will be conducted w ith meals, snacks and beverages provided ad lib. 
Rationale: In adult volunteers, DYANAVEL XR ha d no food effect. Blood draws can be difficult 
in children, especially when not well-hydrated. Food intake may help reduce emesis (common in 
children during fasting PK studies) and may reduce vasovagal responses  during blood draws. 
Timing of PK sample collection:  The main goal is to limit samples on the day of dosing to no 
more than 8 samples (pre-dose plus [ADDRESS_583507]-dose sa mples) in order to collect an adequate amount 
of data while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_456567]. The following collection times have been 
selected to meet goals of adequate data colle ction and study feasibility : Pre-dose and 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 
10, 12, and [ADDRESS_583508]-dose.  
With the exception of the 0 (pre-dose) and the 28 hour sample, samples will be collected within 
± [ADDRESS_583509]’s case report forms.

Confidential  Page 28 of 46 9.0 ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
This section defines AEs and outlines the procedures for a ppropriately collecting, grading, 
recording, and reporting them.  Information in this section complies w ith 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) 312, ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safe ty Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting , and ICH Guideline E6(R2):  Good Clinical Practice. 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in  this protocol.  During the study, when there is a 
safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for de tecting AEs and SAEs, as 
detailed in this section of the protocol. 
9.[ADDRESS_583526], wh ether or not the event has a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
An AE may be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith the use of a study medication, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any abnormal laboratory 
value deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_31691], regardless of causal relationship, must be 
reported as an AE. 
Examples of an AE include the following: 
 significant or unexpected worsening or ex acerbation of the c ondition or indication 
under study, taking into cons ideration the daily fluctu ation of symptoms of 
ADHD. 
 exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pr eexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (e.g., abnormal physical 
examination finding) 
 signs, symptoms, or clinical sequ elae of a suspect ed interaction 
 signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study 
medication or a concurrent medication (ove rdose per se should not be reported as 
an AE or SAE, unless non serious or serious sequelae occur). 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
 medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the 
condition that leads to th e procedure is an AE 
 anticipated day-to-day fluc tuations of preexisting di sease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at th e start of the study that do 
not worsen 
 the disease or disorder bei ng studied, or expected progr ession, signs, or symptoms 
of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they beco me more severe or occur 
with a greater frequency than expe cted for the subject’s condition. 
 
  
Confidential  Page 29 of 46 9.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria: 
 It results in death or is lif e-threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred).  (This cr iterion is not intended to include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more seve re form, might have caused death.) 
 It results in persistent or substantial disability or incap acitation.  (This criterion is 
not intended to include experiences of rela tively minor medical significance, such 
as uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.) 
 It results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 It results in prolongation of  an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 It is a congenital anom aly or birth defect 
 It requires medical or surg ical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in determining whether an AE is serious 
when considering important medical events that  may not be immediatel y life-threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28689], but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent any of the other outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events that may also be 
considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscr asias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE. 
Social or convenience admission to  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_456573]. 
9.2.1 Serious Adverse Events That Occur Befo re Administration of Study Medication 
Before administration of study medication, only SA Es assessed by [CONTACT_456585] (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing therapy) will 
be transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the sponsor. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_583527] receives study medicatio n, and that investigator consider s the event to be related to 
the study medication, the investigator is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor. 
9.3 Collecting, Recording and Evaluating Adv erse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such  cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or 
symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the point the 
Informed Consent is signed through EOT or Early Termination Visit. 
 
  
Confidential  Page 30 of 46 Both total and treatment-emergent AEs will be reported. Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as 
those that occur after dosing of study medication until EOT or Early Termination Visit. 
9.3.1 Assessment of Intensity 
The investigator will make an assessment of in tensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study, using his or her clinical judgment.  The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded on the 
CRF should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
 Mild :  an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere wi th everyday activities 
 Moderate :  an event that is sufficiently disc omforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities 
 Severe :  an event that prevents normal everyday activities. 
An AE that is assessed as severe s hould not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a term used to 
describe the intensity of a speci fic event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The 
event itself, however, may be of relatively mi nor medical significance (such as a severe 
headache).  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or 
on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning (see Section Error! Reference source not found. ). 
9.3.2 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  The investigator will 
assess the relationship to the study medica tion by [CONTACT_456586]:  
 Definitely Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  
The AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_5349].  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if 
possible) are positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study 
drug.   Another etiology is unlik ely or significantly less likely 
 Probably Related :  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_137581].  
Dechallenge (if performed) is positive 
 Possibly Related :  An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  
The AE could have been due to anothe r equally likely cause; dechallenge is 
positive 
 Not Related :  The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no 
temporal relationship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate 
etiology OR the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illne ss or effect of 
another drug. 
Even in situations in which minimal informati on is available for the initial SAE report, it is 
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before 
transmitting the SAE reporting form and AE CR F page(s) to the sponsor.  The causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used when de termining regulatory reporting requirements.  The 
 
  
Confidential  Page 31 of 46 investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information and 
amend the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) accordingly. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_583528] to fo llow-up.  The investigator will assess the outcome 
of the event by [CONTACT_137582]: 
 Resolved : The event resolved or the subjec t recovered without sequelae.  An 
event (either serious or non serious) occurred and had an  endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions.  Examples incl ude stent placement for coronary artery 
disease (a device implanted is not a seque lae), an appendectomy (a scar is not a 
sequelae), a postoperative w ound infection, or an upper re spi[INVESTIGATOR_260310] t infection 
 Resolved with sequelae : The event has at least 1 secondary outcome that may 
result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  Such sequelae are 
usually limited to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of su rgery), stroke resulting in 
paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function 
 Not resolved : At the end of the study, a non seri ous event either has not changed 
in intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown.  Examples include headache,  low-grade fever, or nausea 
 Unknown : The subject has withdrawn from th e study prematurely or is lost to 
follow-up, and the status of the event is unknown 
 Death

10.1 Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size for this study was powered per FD A instruction to meet the FDA PK quality metric. 
Four to six subjects will provide adequate power for a pharmacokinetic analysis.   
The PK of d- and l-amphetamines are characterized well both in adults and children (Study 2014-
3401, Adderall IR). The predictions of PK in children based on the PK model developed using Study 
2014-[ADDRESS_583531] variability for DYANAVEL XR in adults is about 20% (for 
Clearance and Volume, the primary parameters of interest). Hence a sample size of 4-6 subjects should allow precise estimate of the mean Clearance and Volume.

13.2 Ethics Committees 
The investigator (or sponsor, wher e applicable) is respons ible for ensuring that this protocol, the 
site’s informed consent form, and any other in formation that will be presented to potential 
subjects (e.g., advertisements or information th at supports or supplements the informed consent 
form) are reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_196490].  The investigator agrees to 
allow the IRB or IEC direct access to all relevant documents .  The IRB or IEC must be 
constituted in accordance with all applicable re gulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide 
the investigator with relevant documents or data needed for I RB or IEC review and approval of 
the study.  Before investigational products and CRFs  can be shipped to the site, the sponsor must 
receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_196453], th e approved informed consent form, and any other 
information that the IRB or IEC has appr oved for presentation to  potential subjects. 
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IRB or IEC has 
approved for presentation to poten tial subjects is amended during the study, the investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these 
amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements 
pertaining to the use of an amended informed  consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC 
approval of the amended form, before new subject s consent to take part in the study using the 
new version of the form.  The investigator must promptly forward to the sponsor copi[INVESTIGATOR_456574].  IRB or IEC approval of the 
consent forms must be obtained in addition to the approval gi ven for the clinical study.  
Regulatory review and approval ma y be required in some countries before IRB or IEC approval 
can be sought.

obtained, the Investigator and Tris Pharma will c onsult with each other on how to deal with the 
information.  When Tris Pharma and a res ponsible Investigator judge it necessary, the 
Investigator must immediately provide the subjects with such information, revise the written 
information and other explanatory documents based on the new information, and obtain approval 
from the IRB(s).  In this inst ance, the Investigator should al so immediately inform subjects 
currently participating in the clinical study of  such information, conf irm their intention to 
continue participation, re-explain the study to them using the revised written information and other explanatory documents, and obtain written c onsent to continue part icipation based on their 
voluntary decision. 
13.4 Informed Consent 
Subjects’ parent or legal gua rdian must sign the informed consent form. The sponsor will 
provide investigators with a sample informed consent for this study.  Investigators are 
encouraged to use the sample form; however, they may adapt the information to suit the needs of 
their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent 
specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final in formed consent form must be accepted by [CONTACT_456595].  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final informed consent form before and after it is approved by [CONTACT_4186].  If any new information becomes availabl e that might affect s ubjects’ willingness to 
participate in the study, or if any amendments to  the protocol require ch anges to the informed 
consent form, the sponsor will provide investigator s with a revised informed consent form.  The 
IRB or IEC must provide written approval of an y revisions to the informed consent form in 
advance of its use.

Sample Collection 
The actual date and clock time of each sample collection will be recorded. Samples will be 
collected in pre-chilled, labeled [ADDRESS_583544].  
The samples will be maintained in  an ice bath for no more than 3 hours. If needed, the samples 
can be maintained in refrigerator conditions  (5±3Cº) for up to 8 hours throughout sample 
collection and until further processing. 
Sample Processing and Storage 
Within 8 hours of collection, the blood samples will be centrifuged at room temperature for 10 
minutes at 3000 rpm. Samples that are interr upted during centrifugati on, disturbed during the 
separation process will be re-spun under the same  conditions in an attempt to separated and 
obtain the maximum amount of plasma from each sample.  
Following centrifugation, the plasma will be divided in 2 approximately equal aliquots, placed in 
labeled polypropylene tubes, and kept in an ice bath until storage at −25±10°C. 
Within 60 minutes of centrifugation, the aliquot tubes should be stored at −25±10°C. 
No more than 8 hours should elapse betw een blood draw and centrifugation and no 
more than 60 minutes should elapse after sa mples centrifugation and the freezing of 
the plasma samples.

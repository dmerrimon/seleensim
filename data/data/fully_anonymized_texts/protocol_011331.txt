Study Product, 
Dose, Route, 
Regimen  Patients will first be identified and evaluated with fluoroscopic and 
ultrasound imaging . Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria  they will 
be counseled about eligibility for the study along with discussion of 
standard management options and possible risks of the investigation 
including  full informed consent.  
On day of treatment, patients will undergo instillation of local anesthes ia 
(20 mL of 2% urethral lidocaine jelly), the patient will undergo 
cystoscopy, transurethral injection (via a 70 cm 4.8 Fr flexible cystoscopic 
needle with a 23 gauge needle tip manufactured by [CONTACT_206707]®, Ontario, 
Canada) of  0.08ml of  XIAFLEX® (0.58 mg of XIAFLEX® mixed with 
0.39 mL of sterile diluent)  in a single location within the stricture,  chased 
by [CONTACT_33018] 0.25 mL of reconstituted XIAFLEX®  to allow for 
clearance of the original 0. 08 mL of reconstituted XIAFLEX® from the 
transurethral syringe into the urethral stricture. This is based on 0.2 5 mL 
residual fluid that remains within the lumen of the injeTAK syringe. Thus, 
by [CONTACT_527114] 0.25 mL of XIAFLEX® as a chase, we are 
expecting the original total of 0. 08 mL of X IAFLEX® to be injected into 
the area of scarring.  The depth and location of the needle will be 
determined pre -procedurally with urethral ultrasonography  with the needle 
in a semi -parallel manner into the plaque as to avoid perforation into 
nearby [CONTACT_527115]. Injections will be performed at a single site identified on 
ultrasound as appropriate , and avoiding the 6 o’clock and 12 o’clock sites 
where potential perforation can lead to additional complications . The site 
of injection will be recorded accordingly for safety monitoring following 
treatment.  The remaining 0.[ADDRESS_683947] disposal.

Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/[ADDRESS_683950] of urethral stricture diseases in 2000 was approximately $200 million.  A 
diagnosis of urethral stricture increased health care expenditures by [CONTACT_726] $6,000 per 
individual yearly1.  Conservative management involves frequent straight catheterization or 
management with an  indwelling foley catheter; options that can decrease the patient’s quality of 
life and increase the patient's  risk of urinary tract infections2.   
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_683951] vision internal urethroto my (DVIU) 
and urethr al dilation; these  have been shown to be effective primarily  on single , small bulbar 
strictures (<2cm) , with repeated treatment being almost entirely ineffective3.  Other minimally 
invasive treatments including ur ethral stents, transurethral injection w ith Rapamycin, botulinum 
toxin,  or glucocorticoids have shown limited efficacy or have fallen out of favor  because of 
increased morbidity4, 5. The gold standard for treatment of anterior urethral strictures involves 
excision  of the stricture with primary anastomosis  of the urethra or urethroplasty.  Both  surgi cal 
options , however,  require extensive anesthesia and are often poor options for elderly patients, 
patients with significant comorbidities , or patient who simply do not wish to undergo such 
extensive surgery.  
 
2.2 Clostridium Histolyticum Collagenase  
 
Clostridium histolyticum collagenase (CHC) is an injectable pharmacologic agent that 
works by [CONTACT_527116], with in vitro studies showing 
CHC to be specifically selective for collagen type I and III, the predominant t ypes fo und in 
Peyronie’s plaque’s and  Dupuytren’s contractures.  Additionally, CHC spares collagen type IV, 
which is present within connective tissue of surrounding arteries, large veins, and nerves, 
limiting surrounding nerve or vessel damage6.  CHC, marketed as XIAFLEX® , has been FDA 
approved for treatment of Dupuytren’s  disease , as well as Peyronie’s disease.   Large double 
blind studies have  shown a statistically significant improvement in penile deformity following 
CHC injections7.  Additionally, studies  have shown  significant improvement in curvature in 
patients who performed penile modeling with CHC.  
 
2.2.1 Animal Studies: Toxicity Data  
 Based on a previously conducted study on local toxicity of Auxilium’s collagenase 
(AA4500) injected into various locations within the dogs penis, including the urethra, primary 
side effects were dose related and included discoloration of the penis/prepuce, persistenc e of 
swollen penis, and bruising.8 At a dose of 6.1 μg/kg, which corresponds to 1.1 fold on the mg/kg 
basis of the human dose, 4 out of 6 dogs were able to receive all three doses (total 3 dosing 
cycles). The primary toxicity findings at all dose levels we re hemorrhage, edema, necrosis, 
inflammation, and neovascular proliferation with increasing severity based on dosing.  
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/[ADDRESS_683952] dose on 
Day 61. The consequence of antibody formation is unknown. However, the author did note that 
the presence of antibodies did not result in any apparent adverse systemic effects. Nor did the 
production of antibodies appear to alter the toxicokinetics or pharmacod ynamics effects of 
aA4500.  
 In another animal study, injecting clostridial collagenase (both 150 units and 300 uni ts 
injected) into rats tail tendon showed local collagen lysis of injection at the site of injection only 
at 1 and 24 hours.9 At both doses, no adverse collagenase extravasation was seen at either time at 
the injection site or 0.5 cm proximal or distal to the injection site.  
 
2.3 Rationale for Urethral Stricture Treatment with XIAFLEX®  
 
Urethral strictures, like Dupuytren ’s contractures  and Peyronie’s disease, are associated 
with a total increase in type I and type III collagen smooth muscle10.   A recent study 
investigated injecting urethral strictures with high dose CHC in rats showed reduction in urethral 
fibrosis as well as a reduction in  collagen type I and III expression in the rodent s’ urethral 
strictures11.  We wish to investigate if CHC  would have a similar impact on urethral strictu res in 
men when administered in a similar fashion  to the Peyronie’s disease  algorithm .

5.0 Study Drug  and Device  
 
5.1 Study Agent  
XIAFLEX®  is a combination of bacterial collagenases indicated for the treatments of adult 
patients with Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord and adult men with Peyronie’s 
disease with a palpable plaque and  curvature deformity of at least  30 degrees at the start of 
therapy. XIAFLEX®  contains purified collagenase clostridium histolyticum, consisting of two 
microbial collagenases in a defined mass ratio, Collagenase AUX -I and Collagenase AUX -II, 
which are isolated and purified from the fermentation of Clostrid ium histolyticum bacteria. The 
dosing used for this study is based on recommendations for Peyronie’s disease treatment with 
XIAFLEX® .  
 
5.2 Dose Rationale  
A recently published comprehensive review of recent clinical trials and in vivo studies 
examining CHC  in the treatment of Peyronie’s disease reported that the clinical trials have 
demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of CHC in treating Peyronie’s disease and an in vivo 
study showed that CHC also could be applied to urethral stricture disease without  serious adverse 
complications.12 A recent urethral injection of rat model (300 -350g) used 0.[ADDRESS_683956]. This showed no urethral or voiding complication and no urinary retention or urethral 
fistulas11. This dosing would equal 0.14 -0.33mg/kg. A dose of 0.119mg (0.08ml of 0.58mg 
XIAFLEX in 0.39ml)  in a 70kg patient would be 0.00 17mg/kg.  
 
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   12 5.3 Risks/Benefits  
Urethral stricture disease can be difficult and expensive problem for urologists to manage.  As 
observed with this patient population, conservative management involves frequent straight 
catheterization or management with an  indwelling foley catheter that can decrease the patient’s 
quality of life and increase the patient's  risk of urinary tract infectio ns. Other minimally invasive 
treatments have shown limited efficacy or have increased morbidity. Surgical options  that are 
effective , however, involves higher risks, require extensive anesthesia and are often poor options 
for elderly patients, patients wit h significant comorbidities, or patient who simply do not wish to 
undergo such extensive surgery.  Therefore, treatments with injections may provide sufficient 
potential benefit and an acceptable potential for risk for this study population.  
 
5.4 Dosage and Administration  
On day of treatment, prior to study drug administration, photographic evidence captured with 
urethral ultrasound  will be used to confirm eligibility criterion: < Grade 5 spongiofibrosis. If the 
patient’s urethral ultrasound for Baseline/ Screening was performed more than 30 days  prior to 
the treatment day (Day 0) , it will be performed again on the treatment day (Day 0) prior to study 
drug administration to re-confirm the patient’s study eligibility and to allow for proper 
procedural planni ng for study treatment.  
 
On day of treatment, patients will undergo instillation of local anesthesia (20 mL of 2% urethral 
lidocaine jelly), the patient will undergo cystoscopy, transurethral injection (via a 70 cm 4.8 Fr 
flexible cystoscopic needle with a  23 gauge needle tip manufactured by [CONTACT_206707]®, Ontario, 
Canada) of 0.08ml of XIAFLEX® (0.58 mg of XIAFLEX® mixed with 0.39 mL of sterile 
diluent) in a single location within the stricture, chased by [CONTACT_33018] 0.25 mL of reconstituted 
XIAFLEX® to allow for clearance of the original 0.08 mL of reconstituted XIAFLEX® from the 
transurethral syringe into the urethral stricture. This is based on 0.25 mL residual fluid that 
remains within the lumen of the injeTAK syringe. Thus, by [CONTACT_527114] 0.25 mL  of 
XIAFLEX® as a chase, we are expecting the original total of 0.08 mL of XIAFLEX® to be 
injected into the area of scarring.  The depth and location of the needle will be determined pre -
procedurally with urethral ultrasonography with the needle in a semi -parallel manner into the 
plaque as to avoid perforation into nearby [CONTACT_341050]. Injections will be performed at a single site 
identified on ultrasound as appropriate , and avoiding the 6 o’clock and 12 o’clock sites where 
potential perforation can lead to a dditional complications .  The site of injection will be recorded 
accordingly for safety monitoring following treatment. The remaining 0.[ADDRESS_683957] disposal.  
 
Reconstitution of the Lyophilized Powder for Peyronie’s Disease  (taken from XIAFLEX®  package insert) 
1. Before use, remove the vial containing the lyophilized powder of XIAFLEX®  and the 
vial containing the diluent for reconstitution from the refrigerator and allow the two vials 
to stand at room temperature for at least [ADDRESS_683958] the vial containing XIAFLEX® . The cake of lyophilized powder should 
be intact and white in color.  
2. After removal of the flip -off cap fr om each vial, using aseptic technique swab the rubber 
stopper and surrounding surface of the vial containing XIAFLEX®  and the vial 
containing the diluent for reconstitution with sterile alcohol (no other antiseptics should 
be used).  
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   13 3. Use on the supplied dil uent for reconstitution. The diluent contains calcium which is 
required for the activity of XIAFLEX® . 
4. Using a [ADDRESS_683959] the diluent slow ly into the sides of the vial containing the lyophilized powder of 
XIAFLEX® . Do not invert the vial or shake the solution. Slowly swirl the solution to 
ensure that all of the lyophilized powder has gone into solution.  
6. The reconstituted XIAFLEX®  solution ca n be kept at room temperature (20º to 25ºC/68º 
to 77º F) for up to one hour or refrigerated at 2º to 8ºC (36º to 46ºF) for up to 4 hours prior 
to administration. If the reconstituted XIAFLEX®  solution is refrigerated, allow this 
solution to return to room t emperature for approximately [ADDRESS_683960] the syringe and needle used for reconstitution and the diluent vial.  
 
5.5 Formulation  
XIAFLEX®  will be supplied in single -use glass vials containing 0.9 mg of collagenase 
clostridium histolyticum as a sterile, lyophilized powder for reconstitution. Sterile diluent for 
reconstitution will be provided in a package in a single -use glass vial containin g 3 mL of 0.3 
mg/mL calcium chloride dehydrate in 0.9% sodium chloride.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_683961] of one carton containing 
a single -use vial for XIAFLEX®  and a single -use vial of sterile diluent.  
 
5.7 Storage and Handling  
Prior to reconstitution, the vials of XIAFLEX®  and diluent should be stored in a refrigerator at 
2ºC to 8ºC (36º to 46ºF). The r econstituted XIAFLEX®  solution can be kept at room temperature 
(20º to 25ºC/68º to 77ºF) for up to one hour or refrigerated at 2º to 8ºC (36º to 46ºF) for up to 4 
hours prior to administration.  The Clinical Research Center’s personnel at USF Health South 
Tampa Center for Advanced Healthcare will be monitoring study drug storage integrity (i.e. 
refrigerator temperature monitoring). Records and notifications of temperature excursions will be 
provided to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_527106]. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_527107]. The time of each step in the process (i.e. removal from refrigerator, reconstitution, re -
refrigeration and/or administration) will be recorded accordingly. Study drug will not be used of 
the integrity of study drug is compromised.

6.2 Limited Waiver of Consent  
Potential subjects will be identified through physician referrals (internal/external physicians will 
only share availability of trial, same information as that already shared with the public on 
clinicaltrials.gov, to their patients and provide USF urology clinic or research member’s contact 
[CONTACT_527118] – all study recruitment will still occur at the USF urology 
clinic) and USF urology clinic at the USF Health South Tampa Center for Advanced Healthcare 
– the PI’s and sub -investigator’s clinic. If the patient has urethral stricture, the PI/sub -
investi gator will consider the patient for recruitment for the study. The PI/sub -investigator will 
discuss the study with the patient first, then the research coordinator will be introduced to the 
patient to complete the informed consent process. During the initi al conversation between the 
investigator/research staff and the patient, the patient may be asked to provide certain health 
information that is necessary to the recruitment and enrollment process. The 
investigator/research staff may also review portions of  their medical records in order to further 
assess eligibility  prior to study consent  – the investigators have a treatment relationship with the 
potential subjects and the study coordinators do not . The y will use the information provided by 
[CONTACT_1738]: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   15 the patient and/ or medical record  (USF EPIC electronic medical record system)  to confirm that 
the patient is eligible and to approach  the patient regarding study enrollment. Record review for 
screening purposes will be completed prior to receiving signed consent. If the p atient turns out to 
be ineligible for the research study, the research staff will destroy all information collected on the 
patient during the initial conversation and medical records review, except for any information 
that must be maintained for screening log purposes.  
 
In most cases, the initial contact [CONTACT_321764], investigator or the research staff working in consultation with the treatment 
team. The recruitment process presents no more tha n minimal risk to the privacy of the patients 
who are screened and minimal PHI will be used as part of a screening process. For these reasons, 
we seek a (partial) limited waiver of authorization for the purposes of 1) reviewing medical 
records to identify potential research subjects and obtain information relevant to the enrollment 
process; 2) conversing with patients regarding possible enrollment; 3) handling of PHI contained 
within those records and provided by [CONTACT_41907].

to their patients and provide USF urology clinic or research member’s contact [CONTACT_527119] – all study recruitment will still occur at the USF urology clinic) and within 
our urology practice by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_9814]-investigators . Recruitment may occur in the clinic at USF. 
After identifying a patient who meets minimum eligibility criteria and before collecting any 
study data, the study will be expl ained in detail to the participant including: (1) that the study 
represents a research effort, (2) that participation is voluntary, and there is no penalty for 
withdrawal, (3) any anticipated costs to the patient for participation, (4) potential risks and 
benefits for participation, (5) the procedures to ensure privacy of their medical information, and 
(6) contact [CONTACT_527120]. Patients will be informed of the 
purpose of the study. Only with the full and complete understand ing of the study, and signed 
informed consent, will the evaluation of the potential participant continue.  The subject will be 
given sufficient time to read the consent and ask any questions. Once the informed consent is 
signed, the subject will be given a copy of the document.  
 
6.4 Duration of Study Participation  
Study participation will require up to 2 years involvement.  
 
6.5 Study Visits  
This is a prospective, single -center, open -label study. Patients eligible for the study will undergo 
informed consent. Once consented, patients will be enrolled and treated with an approved open -
label treatment – XIAFLEX®  injection.  
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   16  
6.5.1 Baseline/Screening  
The following procedures will be performed at the Baseline/Screening visit:  
- Screen inclusion/exclusion criteria  
- Obtain informed consent  
- Record demographics and medical and surgical history  
- Evaluate and record concomitant medications  
- Administer American Urological Association (AUA) questionnaire  
- Perform physical exam (as occur per standard of care)  
- Perform retrograde urethrogram (RUG), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), post -void 
residual (PVR), uroflow, and cystoscopy to evaluate and document the anatomy  and 
length and extent of spongiofibrosis at baseline related  to the urethral stricture  (as occur 
per standard of care) . 
- Perform clinic urethral ultrasound to grade urethral stricture based on previously 
described grading system . (Figure 1)  
 
 
Figure 1. Urethral stricture grading scale based on urethral ultrasound   
 
6.5.2 Treatment (Day 0)   
The following procedures will be performed on day of XIAFLEX® injection treatment:  
- Evaluate and record concomitant medications  
- Perform study treatment  
- Assess for adverse events . Patients will be kept in clinic with vitals at 60min following 
injection to en sure no allergic reaction. Patients will be kept on campus until they have 
voided twice with a PVR <250ml or no more than 20% greater than their pre -procedural 
PVR.   
Treatment  Group – XIAFLEX® injection  
On day of treatment, patients will undergo instillation of local anesthesia (20 mL of 2% urethral 
lidocaine jelly), the patient will undergo cystoscopy, transurethral injection (via a 70 cm 4.8 Fr 
flexible cystoscopic needle with a 23 gauge needle tip manu factured by [CONTACT_206707]®, Ontario, 
Canada) of 0.08ml of XIAFLEX® (0.58 mg of XIAFLEX® mixed with 0.39 mL of sterile 
diluent) in a single location within the stricture, chased by [CONTACT_33018] 0.25 mL of reconstituted 
XIAFLEX® to allow for clearance of the orig inal 0.08 mL of reconstituted XIAFLEX® from the 
transurethral syringe into the urethral stricture. This is based on 0.25 mL residual fluid that 
remains within the lumen of the injeTAK syringe. Thus, by [CONTACT_527114] 0.25 mL of 
XIAFLEX® as a chase, we are expecting the original total of 0.08 mL of XIAFLEX® to be 
injected into the area of scarring.  The depth and location of the needle will be determined pre -
procedurally with urethral ultrasonography with the needle in a semi -parallel manner into the

weeks.  
 
6.5.5 Follow -up (6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months (± 7 days) )  
The patient will have follow -up evaluations in clinic at 6, 9, 12 , 18, and 24 (± 7 days) months 
following the first treatment  visit.   
 
The following procedures will be performed at these visits : 
- Perform physical exam  
- Perform cystoscopy,  urethral ultrasound,  uroflow, PVR measurements , and evaluate 
length and extent of spongiofibrosis.  
- Administer AUA questionnaire  
- Evaluate and record concomitant medications  and post treatment interventions, if 
anyAssess for adverse events  
 
6.5.6 Unscheduled Visits

6.5.7 Early Termination  
 
Early Discontinuation  
Reasons for discontinuation of treatment may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
- Patient withdrawal of consent  
- Any medical condition that the Investigator determines may jeopardize the patient’s 
safety if he continues in the study  
- Investigator determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
- Patie nt noncompliance, such as missing scheduled visits, non -adherence with 
concomitant medications, etc.  
- Lost to follow -up 
- If patients have no clinical response to the intervention and have persistent clinical 
manifestations of their stricture disease they may elect to undergo  definite management in 
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   19 the form of urethral dilation, urethrectomy, or urethral reconstruction. They will still be 
followed per above protocol and included in all statistical analysis.  
 
After study treatment is discontinued, patient will  be asked to remain in the study whenever 
possible and complete all study visits according to the planned schedule of assessments (except 
for patients who have withdrawn consent and are lost to follow -up). The primary reason for 
premature discontinuation o f study treatment should be documented appropriately. If a patient 
chooses to discontinue study treatment and withdraw from the study, then the patient will be 
asked to return to the clinic for the early termination (ET) visit and complete all assessments.  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment will not be replaced.  
 
Early Withdrawal  
All patients have the right to withdraw from study participation without prejudice at any time 
during the study. If a patient terminates participation in the stu dy, the Investigator will make a 
reasonable effort to determine  the cause of study withdrawal. If, for whatever reason, a patient 
withdraws from the study or the study is terminated while the patient is receiving study 
treatment, an early termination (ET) visit will be performed.  
 
Patients who prematurely withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
 
The following procedures will performed at the ET visit  if allowed by [CONTACT_4676] : 
- Perform physical exam  
- Perform cystoscopy,  urethra ultrasound, uroflow, PVR measurements , and evaluate 
length and extent of spongiofibrosis  
- Administer AUA questionnaire  
- Evaluate and record concomitant medications , medical and surgical history  
- Assess for adverse events  
 
6.6 Sample Size  Justification

pi[INVESTIGATOR_527110] . A total of 5 patients will be enrolled in th is study.   
 
6.7 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Data analysis will be conducted using de -identified data in SPSS  or SAS  statistical software.  
 
Study Population Analysis  
The distributions of the following characteristics will be tabulated and presented with descriptive 
statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and patient count for 
continuo us variables, and counts with percentages for categorical variables):  
- Demographics  
- Medical and surgical history  
- Final study exit classification (completed, discontinued, withdrew)  
     
Primary Safety Endpoint  
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   20 The primary safety variable will be complication rates following treatment  (XIAFLEX®) . 
Complications – specifically focus on pain, fever, genital lesions, or postoperative AEs related to 
treatment  (XIAFLEX®)  
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints will be evaluated with the following tests:

during the 2 years follow -up. Further intervention – defined as any medical or surgical 
intervention for treatment of urethral stricture.  
- Incidenc e of urethral stricture recurrence within 2 years following initial treatment will be 
calculated and presented with descriptive statistics  
- Elapsed time to urethral stricture recurrence and elapsed time to additional intervention 
for urethral stricture trea tment within 2 years following initial treatment will be 
calculated and presented with descriptive statistics  
- Efficacy of XIAFLEX®  treatment in improving obstructive voiding dysfunction  will be 
analyzed using paired t -test for the difference in uroflow and  post-void residual 
measurements before and after study treatment (collected at baseline, [ADDRESS_683972] 
treatment and follow -up visits)  
- Quality of life will be analyzed using paired t -test for the difference in AUA scores 
before and after study initial treatment (collected at baseline, [ADDRESS_683973] treatment and 
follow -up visits)  
 
Secondary Safety Endpoints  
The results of the following safety endpoints will be calculated and presented with descriptive 
statistics for all patients receiving study treatment.  
- Complication rates following treatment – specifically pain, fever, genital lesions, or 
postoperative complaints secondary to treatment  
- Incidence of formation of spongiofibrosis or change in length and extent of 
spongiofibrosis  
- Incidence of change in normal  urethra structure proximal to injected tissue  
- Incidence and severity of treatment -emergent AEs/SAEs during the study  
- Proportion of patients completing study treatment

Risk related to b reach of confidentiality  
The risks of participants in this project involve the use of PHI for the initial access to study -
related data. Anytime such data is accessed and stored by [CONTACT_527121], the risk of breached data s ecurity is increased, however all means necessary have been 
inputted to secure the information. Medical record numbers and patient names will be used to 
access the patient’s medical record. Once the data collection is complete, the medical record 
numbers, patient names, and any other PHI will be destroyed.  
 
Risks related to completing the surveys  
The cognitive assessments ask about disease  and health.  Thinking about these things may make 
the patient  uncomfortable. The patient  may also feel a loss of privacy by [CONTACT_527122]. The responses will be kept confidential and the patient  may skip any questions he does 
not want to answer.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_683975] (DSMB) will be established to monitor adverse reactions 
and the safety of the study. The DSMB will consist of experts in the relevant biomedical fields of 
urology and biostatistics. The members will have no direct relationship to the study  (will not 
involve in any study related activit ies but may have their inputs in the study design and changes) . 
The DSMB will review the protocol of the study and periodically monitor the progress, data, 
outcomes and safety during the study. An analysis will be performed after [ADDRESS_683976] treatment visits . All adverse events and 
reactions will be tabulated and presented to the DSMB. Further safety analysis will be performed 
by [CONTACT_527123].  
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/2021   23  
9.1 Adverse Ev ents 
Adverse ev ents (AE) will be monitored and collected by [CONTACT_527124]’s participation in the study. For each AE, a detailed explanation will 
be obtained from the patient and patient’s medical record. All AEs are  to be recorded on the case 
report forms located in the patient’s study binder and master database maintained by [CONTACT_28824].  
 
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug -related. All adverse events, including observed 
or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded. Subjects will be 
instructed to report any adverse event they experience to the  investigator/study staff. 
Investigators will assess for adverse events at each visit and record accordingly. Any medical 
condition that is present when a subject is screened or present at baseline that does not worsen or 
deteriorate will not be reported a s an adverse event. However, medical conditions present at 
baseline that change in severity at any time during the study will be reported as an adverse event.  
The investigator will exercise his medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnorm al assessment is clinically significant. The investigator will rate the severity of and clarify 
each adverse event based on the definitions below.  
Assess of Severity of Adverse Event:  
- Mild – transient in nature and generally does not interfere with normal activities  
- Moderate – sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
- Severe – incapacitating, causing inability to perform normal activities  
Assessment of Adverse Event and Study Drug Relatedness:  
No related – definitely not related to stud y drug and is judged clearly due to causes other than 
study drug  
Unlikely related – follows a temporal sequence from study drug administration, such that a 
relationship is not likely and could be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s current medical 
condit ion or other standard of care treatment the subject is receiving  
Possibly related – follows a temporal sequence from study drug administration, but may be due 
to another cause and could also be reasonable explained by [CONTACT_423]’s current medical 
conditio n or other standard of care treatment the subject is receiving  
Definitely related – clearly related to study drug administration  
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of the following:  
- Death  
- Life-threatening adverse event – subject is at immediate risk of death due to adverse 
event occurrence  
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]  
- Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
- Significant medical ev ent that may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes above  
 
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/[ADDRESS_683977] (IRB) promptly, or within five (5) 
calendar days:  
• A single occurrence of a serious, unexpected event that is uncommon and strongly 
associated with drug exposure (such as angioedema, agranulocytosis, hepatic injury, or 
Stevens -Johnson syndrome;  
• A single occurrence, or more often a small number of occurrences, of a serious, unexpected 
event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but uncommon in the study 
population (e.g., tendon rupture, progressive multifocal leukoencepha lopathy);  
• Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on aggregate analysis, is determined to be an 
unanticipated problem. There should be a determination that the series of AEs represents a 
signal that the AEs were not just isolated occurrences and involv e risk to human subjects;  
• An AE that is described or addressed in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed 
consent documents, but occurs at a frequency or severity that is inconsistent with prior 
observations.  
• A serious AE that is described or addressed in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or 
informed consent documents, but for which the rate of occurrence in the study represents a 
clinically significant increase in the expected rate of occurrence (ordinarily, reporting would 
only be tri ggered if there were a credible baseline rate for comparison).  
• Any other AE or safety finding that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigator’s 
brochure, study protocol, or informed consent documents, or would prompt other action by 
[CONTACT_527125] e nsure the protection of human subjects.  
• Any breaches in confidentiality that would place the participant or others at risk;  
• Any change in FDA labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic 
used in a research protocol;  
• Any change to the protocol that was taken without prior IRB approval to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant;  
• Incarceration of a participant when enrolled on a study not approved under Subpart C 
provisions; or  
• Breach of privacy or confidentiality including the loss of data on a computer or any 
electronic device which holds private or confidential information.  
 
A comprehensive list of all adverse and serious adverse events will be submitted with each 
continuing review application to the USF IRB.  
 
9.4 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_527111], including by [CONTACT_527126] a higher than anticipated rate of ≥ 1% for any component 
resulting in an unanticipated S AEs.  Subjects will also be withdrawn from the study if benefits are 
outweighed by [CONTACT_527127].  
 
The study will be stopped altogether if there is one case of study treatment adversely affecting 
other post treatment intervention and/or urethroplasty in patient s with recurrence of urethral 
stricture as determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_527112].  
Protocol: CHC v6.0 01/25/[ADDRESS_683978] copy documents will be kept in a locked room  
in the research coordinator’s office  for the duration of the study . Data entry will be completed in 
the REDCap secured database . REDCap data will be exported int o Excel or other file format for 
data analysis. Only de -identified data will be used for data analysis.  Collected data will be sent to 
a biostatistician consultant for statistical analysis.  
 
Data will be kept secure for at least [ADDRESS_683979].

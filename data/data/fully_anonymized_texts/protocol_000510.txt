• Physical examination

Statistical Methods:   
The primary hypothesis is that bexagliflozin is non -inferior to sitagliptin  by [CONTACT_742428]1c reduction at week 24 in combination with metformin . The non -
inferiority margin for mean change from  baseline at week  24 in HbA1c comparing 
bexagliflozin group with sitagliptin  group will be 0.35%. Superiority will be declared without 
additional statistical testing when the upper  bound of the 95% CI for difference in change 
from baseline at week  24 in HbA1c comparing bexagliflozin group with sitagliptin  group is 
less than 0. The treatment difference will be examined by [CONTACT_2329] a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis of covar iance model (ANCOVA). The model will include  
treatment, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction , region and the baseline HbA1c value as a 
fixed effect covariate. Least squares mean treatment differences between the bexagliflozin 
group and the comparator grou p at week [ADDRESS_1014792] correlation. 
If the model with the unstructured covariance structure does not converge, an autoregressive  
(1) covaria nce structure will be used.  HbA1c values obtained after the start of rescue 
medication will  not be excluded from this primary analysis.  Primary endpoint s will be 
analyzed on both intention -to-treat ( ITT) and per protocol ( PP) analysis sets.  
The MMRM model is one approach to obtain treatment effect estimates in the presence of 
missing data. As sensitivity analyses for missing data, the following will be performed  on 
both ITT and PP analysis sets : 
1. Missing data will be imputed via multiple imputations , followi ng which the MMRM will 
be repeated on the complete datasets with results combined across com plete datasets 
using standard multiple imputation  techniques; HbA1c values collected after the start of 
rescue medication will be excluded . 
2. Missing data will be imp uted via last observation carried forward  (LOCF ), following 
which the MMRM will be repeated; HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue 
medication will be considered missing.  
3. HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication will be conside red missing, 
and the MMRM analyses will be re -performed.  
 
The effect s of bexagliflozin  on the changes  from baseline  at week 24  in FPG, body weight 
and SBP  will be tested as  key secondary endpoints and will be analyzed in a hierarchical 
testing strategy an d only if the primary objective is met . Similar to the primary endpoint, 
MMRM ANCOVA models will be used . A hierarchical testing strategy will be followed to 
preserve experiment -wide alpha at 0.05:  
1. Superiority test of the change in FPG in the bexagliflozin  group vs. the sitagliptin group

Additional effects of bexagliflozin  versus sitagliptin  on the chang es in HbA1c, FPG, SBP, 
body weight , and the proportion of su bjects who reach an HbA1c  < 7%, as well as the 
general safety in subjects with T2DM , will be analyzed  as exploratory efficacy  endpoints.

power at a 0.025  level  of significance. To allow for an estimated 8.0% dropout rate, 187 
patients will be randomized in each treatment arm , and the total sample size will be 374 
subjects for this study .

Confidential  Page 14 of 69 Global Versio n 2.0 1 INTRODUCTION  
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide, affecting an estimated 415 million people in 2015 . Approximatel y 187 million of 
those affected are thought to be unaware of their condition and over 80% reside in low - and 
middle -income countries  (IDF 2015 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_1014799] 90% of all diabetes 
cases, which is characterized by [CONTACT_742429]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_532513], the nu mber of people 
with diabetes is projected to increase by [CONTACT_47071] 55% to over 642 million adults by 2040 (IDF 
2015 ). Among the debilitating consequences of T2DM are perip heral neuropathy, 
retinopathy, renal failure, peripheral ischemia and exacerbations of cardiovascular disease, 
which result in blindness, amputation, dialysis , and death.  
T2DM is a disease strongly linked to increased body fat mass in the majority of cases  
(Schwartz, Fabricatore et al. 2012 ). Weight loss has been shown to improve glycemic control 
and to reduce the severity of diabetes -associated comorbidities, supporting the view that anti -
diabetic agents that promote weight loss may be particularly beneficial for the treatment of 
the disease (Look, Wing et al. 2013 ; Scheen and Van Gaal 2014 ). Several classes of agents 
are available for treating T2DM , including insulin and its secretagogues , such as 
sulfonylureas (SU) , PPAR agonists, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon -like 
peptide 1 (GLP -1) receptor agonists , meglit inides,  dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors , 
and sodium glucose linked transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) .  Metformin is the first line 
medic ation f or treating T2DM; however, as T2DM  progresses  over time , metformin 
monotherapy is not able to adequately manage hyperglycemia. T2DM  patients often receive 
more than one antidiabetic medication  after an initial treatment period of metformin 
monothera py. DPP4 inhibitors  are considered second -line therapy for T2DM in clinical 
practice and are often prescribed with metformin as a combination therapy for treating 
T2DM. Sitagliptin is a DPP -[ADDRESS_1014800] weight gain or increased hypoglycemia risk compared with placebo.  
The rapid growth rate in the incidence of T2DM has led to an increasing recognition that 
additional therapeutics are needed to provide safe and effective red uctions of elevated plasma 
glucose levels . New agents to treat T2DM, either as monotherapy or add -on therapy to other 
anti-diabetic medications, would ideally treat hyperglycemia and avoid common side effects 
of currently available agents, such as weight g ain, gastrointestinal disturbance, and 
hypoglycemia.  
The renal Na+/glucose transport protein SGLT2 actively transports extracellular glucose into 
cells using the driving energy of the transmembrane electrochemical potential for sodium

glucosuria in the absence of significant co -morbidities (van den Heuvel, Assink et  al. 2002 ; 
Santer, Kinner et al. 2003 ). The excre tion of glucose in the urine of diabetic subjects in 
amounts comparable to or greater than that seen in individuals harboring loss of function 
mutations in SLC5A2  has the potential to improve fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia 
without increasing insuli n secretion, causing weight gain, or inducing hypoglycemia. Several 
SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated these clinical benefits , as well as sustained weight loss , 
when used as a monotherapy or in combination with other oral anti -diabetic medications 
includi ng insulin (Nauck 2014 ; Seufert 2015 ). 
1.2  Bexagliflozin  for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
Bexagliflozin is a candidate oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) that is a potent and highly 
specific inhibitor of SGLT2. It was identified following a synthetic program aimed at 
creating molecules with high selectivity and potency for SGLT2 (Zhang, Welihinda et al. 
2011 ). Bexagliflozin has been shown to cause dose -dependent increases in urinary glucose 
excretion (UGE) in humans, rats, dogs , and monkeys and to reduce HbA1c in animal models 
of T2DM as well as in diabetic subjects. In a 12 week monotherapy  study, bexagliflozin  
tablets, 20 m g, showed greater placebo adjusted HbA1c  reduction ( -0.80%) than 
bexagliflozin, 10 mg ( -0.68%) , and bexagliflozin , 5 mg (-0.55%). Bexagliflozin 
administration has been well tolerated. The safety and efficacy of bexagliflozin tablets , 
20 mg, were evaluated in a 96 -week study that measured reduction in hemoglobin A1c  
(HbA1c)  as the primary endpoint.  This 96 week study showed bexagliflozin tablets, 20 mg , 
to be superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c.   Details of the pharmacology, efficacy, and 
safety assessmen ts are described in the Investigator’s Brochure.  The safety profile supports 
continue d evaluation of the treatment effect when used in combination with metformin.

initiate a more intense pharmacological regimen for glucose control.   
A subject will be excluded from further participation if the SMBG  is ≥ 250 mg/dL  on [ADDRESS_1014810], increased urination, or fatigue , should also be excluded.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period  
During the treatment period, subjects will be advised to continue daily, fasting SMBG 
measurements. Subjects should contact [CONTACT_742431] ≥  270 mg/dL  
(15 mmol/L ) from week 0 to week 6, ≥  240 mg/d L (13.3 mmol/L ) after week 6 to week 12, 
or ≥ 200 mg/d L (11.1 mmol/L ) after week 12.  Blood glucose values collected via SMBG will 
be evaluate d at study visits by [CONTACT_093]. In addition, hyperglycemia will be monitored

studied during the treatment period (24 weeks).  
Bexagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor developed for the treatment of T2DM that reduces 
hyperglycemia via an insulin -independent pathway of inhibiting glucose re -uptake and 
promoting urinary glucose excretion. Individuals treated with metformin and with inadequate 
glycemic control have reduced HbA1c, reduced body weight, and less incidence of 
hypoglycemia when treated with approved SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin or 
empagliflozin. Thus T2DM subjects on metformin therapy with inadequate glycemic control 
may benefit from combination treatment with bexagliflozin.

Confidential  Page 23 of 69 Global Versio n 2.0 3.3.3  Rationale for the Dos e Selection  
Bexagliflozin produces a dose -dependent and saturable increase in UGE in healthy 
volunteers and subjects with T2DM. Population pharmacodynamic modeling has indicated 
that bexagliflozin doses of 20 mg result in approximately 90% of the maximal U GE. In a 12 -
week dose range finding study, daily administration of 20 mg bexagliflozin was found to 
reduce HbA1c by 0.80% compared to placebo at week 12, a greater reduction than found in

also observed following [ADDRESS_1014821] infections  (UTI) and GMI s, were found to be similar between placebo 
and active agent cohorts. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of bexagliflozin compared to

5.5 Blinding  
This is a double -blind, double dummy study. The sponsor, investigators, study coordinators, 
pharmacists,  study subjects, the cardiovascular  endpoint c ommittee  (CEC ), and the DKA  
committee will be blinded to the study medication s.  
To maintai n blinding of the individual treatment assignment , the results of urinary glucose 
testing will not be made available to any study personnel or subjects.  If knowledge of the test 
results is needed to manage a subject’s condition, the investigator will conta ct the IWRS to 
obtain the treatment assignment. If unblinding occurs for any reason, the time and reason for 
breaking the blind will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) and the sponsor must be 
notified within [ADDRESS_1014835] of care guidance documents for the management of 
T2DM. Instructions for rescue medication  for hyperglycemia are  provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Subjects will be allowed to take medicat ions or medicinal supplements prescribed to manage 
non-diabetic medical conditions during the study. Any conc urrent medication or 
supplemental treatment of other, non -diabetes, medical  conditions should be continued at a 
stable dose and frequency for the e ntire study duration unless there is a clinical reason to 
change the dose or frequency.  
Subjects may receive any medications for AEs that are necessary in the investigators’ 
judgment. Medications prescribed after the informed consent  are to be recorded on  the CRF. 
The medication name, dose, frequency, route of administration, date(s) of administration , and 
reason for administration must be recorded. This documentation should continue through the 
treatment period and the follow -up period.

neuropathy, non -traumatic amputations, and DKA , including date of diagnosis  
• Frequency of hypoglycemic even ts (per week) that are symptomatic or require assistance  
6.3.3  Cardiovascular Disease History  
History of cardiovascular disease , including presence of angina, congestive heart failure 
(including NYHA classification), known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , prior MI, 
transient ischemic attack  (TIA)  or stroke, and prior cardiac or peripheral re -vascularization 
procedures. The history should include the date of diagnosis and the current status of 
diagnosis (resolved or ongoing).  
6.3.4  Medication History  
• Use of pre scribed or non -prescribed medications, including name [CONTACT_2100], 
indications for usage, start and stop dates, dose, and frequency  
• Use of supplements, including over the counter drugs, vitamins, herbal preparations, and 
dietary supplements within the pa st 30 days prior to screening. Each medication history 
will include the agent used, indication for usage, start and stop dates, dose, and frequency  
 
6.4 Diet and Exercise Counseling  
Subjects will receive counseling regarding appropriate diet and exercise to a id in glycemic 
control based on standards of medical care in diabetes throughout the study. In addition, all 
subjects are encouraged to consume enough liquid to maintain adequate hydration.  
6.5 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be perf ormed by [CONTACT_397922] ( Appendix 1 ). The examination will include 
measurement of body weight and a general assessment of all body systems , including the 
skin, head, ey es, ears, nose, throat, neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes,  vascular 
system  and extremities.  The body weight must be determined using a scale that is calibrated. 
The same scale  should be used for the duration of the study if possible . 
6.6 Abbreviated Phy sical Examination  
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed by [CONTACT_397922] ( Appendix 1 ). An abbreviated physical examination will 
include height (only a t the screening visit)  and general assessment of the skin, heart, lungs 
and abdomen , and extremities . The body weight must be determined using a scale that is 
calibrated. The same scale should be used for the duration of the study if possible.

determined using a scale that is calibrated. The same scale should be used for the duration of 
the study , if possible.  
6.8 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measur ed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 
1) and will include supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting , and standing BP measurements, and heart rate. Only the 
BP measured in the sitting position will be used to determine  eligibility.  
Devices designed to measure BP from the finger or wrist may not be used. The left arm and 
same cuff sizes should be used for each measurement at all visits. If the left arm cannot be 
used at the screening visit or during the study for BP measurem ents, the reason should be 
documented, and the right arm should be used for BP measurements for all subsequent visits.  
At each visit, BP measurements will be obtained using a calibrated sphygmomanometer 
while the subject is in sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and standing  positions. A single heart rate measurement 
should be taken just prior to the BP evaluation in the sitting, supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and standing positions.  
All readings are to be entered into the source document and CRF for all subjects. The date 
and time of BP measureme nts should be captured in the source document and CRF. BP will 
be assessed first in the sitting position. Sitting BP and heart rate will be measured after the 
subject has been sitting for at least [ADDRESS_1014848] abnormalities or arrhythmia.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review the results of the ECG as they become 
availa ble. For each abnormal ECG result, the investigator shall ascertain if the observation 
represents a clinically significant change from the screening ECG for that individual subject.

Low density lipoprotein cholesterol  (LDL -C) will be calculated by [CONTACT_6459]. 
If triglycerides are > 400 mg/dL, the calculated LDL -C value is invalid by [CONTACT_532592]. Direct LDL -C will be determined in subjects whose triglyceri des are > 
350 mg/dL at screening visit. All subsequent LDL -C of these subjects will be determined by 
[CONTACT_272292] -C measurements only.  
An investigator can perform additional laboratory testing to diagnose or to follow up an AE 
progression or resolut ion. Clinical samples should be analyzed in a local laboratory if a fast 
turn-around time is necessary to determine treatment plan.  
6.10.3  Urinalysis  
Urine samples will be collected routinely at designated clinic visits from a clean 
catch  sample. Urinalysis will  be performed at the time points indicated in the schedule of 
events ( Appendix 1  & Appendix 2 ). The i nvestigator or study staff should document if pre -
menopausal female subjects are menstruatin g and note it in the source documents since 
hematuria is  likely to be identified on dipstick urinalysis.  
Strips  to assess leukocyte esterase and nitrite but not glucose will be provided for immediate 
assessment at the clinical sites. If more than traces of  positive results are shown in the 
leukocyte esterase and/or nitrite testing, a urine culture should be performed in a  designated

Confidential  Page 39 of 69 Global Versio n 2.0 6.16 Adverse Events Assessments   
6.16.1  Definition of Adverse Events   
Adverse event (AE ): Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical p roduct that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not it is considered related to the medicinal product use.  
Serious adverse event (SAE): A serious AE (SAE ) or reaction is any untoward medical 
occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  (NOTE: The term "life -threa tening" in this context refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity   
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is a medically important event or reaction.  Medical and scientific judgment should be  
exercised in deciding whether a situati on should be considered serious . Important  medical 
events which  jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above should usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of  drug 
dependency or drug abuse   
 
Adverse Reaction: An adverse reaction means any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected AEs in which there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused 
the event.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction (UADR): An adverse reaction, the nature or severity 
of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e. g. Investigator’s 
Brochure for an unapproved investigational medicinal product).  
Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): A serious UADR.  The 
sponsor must report any suspected S[LOCATION_003]R in an IND safety report (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i)). 
Before  submitting an IND safety report, the sponsor needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three of the definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -1442 -C-423  06 April 2017   
   
 
Confidential  Page 40 of 69 Global Versio n 2.0  
Severity: AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated in the CRF. The 
intensity of an AE is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild: event is medically significant but produces no disruption to daily activity  
2 = Moderate: event is medically significant and reduces or affects normal daily activity  
3 = Severe: event is medically significa nt and results in inability to work or perform  
normal daily activity  
Investigational Product Causality: An assignment made by [CONTACT_272262]. Cases with causal relationship classified as 
possible, probable , or definite are defined as related. Cases with causal relationship 
categorized as not likely or unrelated are defined as not related. Relationship  of an AE to 
dosing will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  The event responds to withdrawal of the i nvestigational product (dechallenge), 
and recurs with rechallenge by [CONTACT_272263]   
• Probable:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. The event responds to dechallenge. Recha llenge is not required  
• Possible:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
and the AE. Dechallenge is lacking or dechallenge response is unclear  
• Not Likely : There is a temporal relationship to investigational product adm inistration, 
but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and 
the event  
• Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to investigational product 
administration  
 
6.16.[ADDRESS_1014855] consents to participation in the study, the  investigator will periodically assess 
subjects for the occurrence of AEs. To avoid bias in collecting information about AEs, the 
investigator should ask subjects the following question: "How have you felt sinc e you were 
last checked?" All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_397923].  
It is the investigator's  responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they 
become available. For each abnormal laboratory test result , the investigator needs to ascertain 
if this is a clinically significant change from baseline for that individual subject . This 
determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is  observed. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests 
to verify the results of the original laboratory tests . If the laboratory value is determined to be 
a clinically significant and abnormal change from baseline for that s ubject, this is considered 
a laboratory AE.  
In addition, the sponsor ’s Medical Monitor or its designated personnel must be notified 
immediately by [CONTACT_756], email, or fax of any immediately reportable AEs (IRAE) 
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014856] (including 
laboratory abnormalities) should be reported to t he sponsor within [ADDRESS_1014857].  
6.16.4  Pregnancy   
Women of childbearing potential  (WOCBP ) who are sexually active must use an effective 
method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is 
minimized.  
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review guidelines about 
study participation for WOCBP. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_78609]:  
• General inform ation  
• Informed consent form  
• Pregnancy prevention information  
• Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
 
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importan ce of avoiding pregnancy 
during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The 
subject must sign an informed consent form confirming that  the above -mentioned risk factors 
and that the consequences were discussed with  her. 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_397924] (e.g. missed or late menstrual cycle).  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to inv estigational 
product administration, the investigational product administration must be withheld until the 
results of serum pregnancy tests are available. If the pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must 
not receive the investigational product and must not be enrolled or remain in the study. If 
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014858] it to 
sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  
Protocol required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on 
the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] ( e.g. x-ray studies). Othe r appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on the appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form, 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including  perinatal and 
neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of six months.  
6.16.[ADDRESS_1014859]’s treatment is 
required for clinic al care and safety. The Emergency Code Break module in the IWRS is 
used for such situations. The investigator must confirm the intention to unblind the subject’s 
treatment to obtain the dose information in IWRS. Upon completion of the unblinding, the 
syste m will send an alert to designated study team members that an unblinding event has 
occurred. Documentation of breaking the blind should be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record with the date and time the blind was broken, and the names of the personnel 
requesting and authorizing unblinding. The treatment assignment will continue to be 
withheld from the CEC members until all phase [ADDRESS_1014860] has returned to the baseline state of health, or the investigator 
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014861]’s condition. The 
investigator should continue to report any significant follow -up information to the sponsor 
until the event has been resolved.  
Any new SAEs reported by [CONTACT_397926], and are determined by [CONTACT_742436], should be reported to the sponsor or designated personnel. This 
may include SAEs that are captured on follow -up telephone contact [CONTACT_742437] (i.e . up to last scheduled contact). The investigator should 
follow SAEs identified after the last scheduled contact [INVESTIGATOR_201170], or the 
subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator should continue to report any signific ant follow -
up information to the sponsor until the event has been resolved. This study requires that 
subjects be actively monitored for SAEs for at least [ADDRESS_1014862] Infections (UTIs)  
Events potentially representing UTI s, including cystitis, urethritis, pyelonephritis, or 
urosepsis, should be carefully evaluated . Documentation  of signs, symptoms, culture results 
for infectious agent, and treatment should be undertaken when appropriate.  
The investigator should query the subject at every clinical visit for symptoms that may be 
related to a UTI and, if appropriate, document these events as symptomatic UTI in the CRF 
unless an alternative diagnosis is present. In addition, a clean catch urine sample will be 
obtained at all c linical visits and a urinalysis will be performed on that sample at every 
clinical visit. A positive urinalysis will be defined as one with detectable leukocyte esterase 
and/or nitrites. If the subject reports symptoms consistent with a UTI or the urinalys is at the 
clinical site is positive, a urine culture will be performed at the central laboratory. A positive 
urine culture will be defined as one with 105 CFU of any species. The investigator may also 
perform a urine culture using local resources if necess ary for clinical care.  
6.16.9  Genital Mycotic Infections (GMIs)   
The investigator will query the subjects for signs or symptoms that may represent a GMI at 
all clinic visits. GMIs will be diagnosed based on symptoms and, if appropriate, physical 
exam and laborat ory findings. Investigators must exclude the possibility of sexually 
transmitted infections before diagnosing GMI. Diagnosis of GMIs must be documented in 
the CRF.

The investigator should perform additional laboratory and imaging tests to attempt to 
establish the cause of the AST and ALT elevations, including ruling out any potential 
contribution from bone or muscle etiologies.  
Any clinically significant increase in hepatic enzymes and specifically any ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1014865] every 96 hour s (4 
days) until ALT and AST return to < 2.[ADDRESS_1014866] results are 
stable and significant changes are not expected anymore . Study medication should be 
stopped and the ev ent should be reported as a laboratory AE within the CRF if the enzyme 
elevation is confirmed or worsening.  
Should it be determined that the etiology is an unrelated acute or chronic medical condition 
(e.g.; NASH, Hepatitis A) and the return of LFT abnorm alities to normal is unlikely  during 
the course of the illness, further testing and follow up is at the investigator ’s discretion.  
Hepatotoxicity will be diagnosed and entered as an AE should any of the following occur:  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1014867]  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1014868] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1014869] or INR > 1.5  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1014870] with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5 %) 
 
In the event of hepatotoxicity, investigational produc t should be permanently discontinued. 
The investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor regarding diagnostic 
evaluation for the hepatic enzyme elevations. Consultation with a hepatologist may also be 
appropriate in some circumstances.  
6.16.[ADDRESS_1014871] the following information for each hypoglycemic 
event  in the glycemic control diary :

• Time elapsed from the most recent meal to the onset of signs and symptoms  
• Duration, intensity, and type of any exercise within the 24 h prior t o the signs and 
symptoms  
• Type of treatment used (e.g., juice, crackers) for the signs and symptoms and whether 
assistance was required from another person to administer the treatment  
• SMBG reading 15 minutes after treatment with carbohydrate and the time at  which this 
was measured  
• Whether or not the signs and symptoms attributed to hypoglycemia resolved after blood 
glucose returned to normal  
 
Subjects are encouraged to call the study clinic should signs and symptoms potentially 
related to hypoglycemia occur.  
At each study visit, the investigator is expected to review the glucometer and glycemic 
control diary with particular attention to any SMBG value < 70 mg/dL and any recorded 
signs or symptoms potentially related to hypoglycemia. In addition, the investiga tor should 
query the subject with regard to the occurrence of signs and symptoms potentially related to 
hypoglycemia even if none are recorded in the diary.  
In the event of a blood glucose value < 70 mg/dL or signs and symptoms potentially related 
to hypo glycemia, the investigator should complete the supplemental CRF which will include 
data from the glycemic control diary and action items to reduce future hypoglycemia 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Hypoglycemia events will be recorded in the hypoglycemia log under 5 categorie s: 
1. Severe hypoglycemia: an event requiring assistance by [CONTACT_272269], glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_272210]. Plasma glucos e 
measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery 
attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. All such 
events should be recorded as SAEs in the CRF  
2. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_272211] a measured plasma glucose concentration < 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L ) 
3. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: an event not  accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_78237] a measured blood glucose concentration  < 70 mg/dL (3.9  
mmol/L ) 
4. Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia 
are not accompanied by a blood glucose determination but that is presumably caused by a 
blood glucose concentration < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L ) 
5. Relative hypoglycemia: An event during which the person with diabetes reports any of 
the typi[INVESTIGATOR_10921], and interprets those as indicative of

Confidential  Page 46 of 69 Global Versio n 2.0 hypoglyc emia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≥ 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L).  
 
While each event meeting the criteria above will be entered into the hypoglycemia log, only 
critical hypoglycemia, documented symptomatic hypoglycemia, asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia, and probable hypoglycemia will be entered as AEs.  
In the event of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, the investigator should review the signs and 
symptoms of hypoglycemia with the subject to elicit a complete description and should 
review proper glucometer technique to ensure that the low glucose value is not due  to 
improper use of the glucometer.  
The investigator should be alerted to the likelihood of improper glucose measurement 
technique if a study subject reports an SMBG value < 55 mg/dL that is not associated with 
any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia and is not treated by [CONTACT_397929].  
In the event of probable symptomatic hypoglycemia, the investigator should encourage the 
subject to obtain glucose values, when possible, in the context of signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia, even if the  glucose value is measured after treatment for the symptoms is 
administered.  
If hypoglycemia occurs in any subject prescribed rescue medication for hyperglycemia 
during the study, the total daily dose of the rescue medication should be reduced 50% or 
more at the discretion of the investigator.  
6.16.12  Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE)  
Evaluation of MACE will be undertaken across the development program for bexagliflozin. 
All MACE reports should also be captured as SAEs and every effort will be made to ensu re 
that events recorded as MACE are coded in a similar manner within the safety database. The 
SAE listing will also be reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_272272]. All subjec ts will be 
followed by [CONTACT_272273].  
The independent CEC will receive and adjudicate the following events.

DKA is a serious, acute complication of diabetes and can be life -threate ning. Subjects will be 
educated on the signs and symptoms of DKA and are required to call the study clinic and 
seek treatment should such signs and symptoms occur.  
During the clinical trial period, potential DKA will be monitored by [CONTACT_742438] t 
of urinary ketones and assessment for signs or symptoms of acidosis at every clinic visit. 
Clinical presentations, such as difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, 
lethargy, a fruity smell in the breath, or laboratory values that suggest c linically -significant 
acidosis should be documented. Treatment  of DKA should be provided when appropriate.  
If ongoing symptoms or signs suggest a possible DKA, the investigator should perform 
relevant laboratory testing while directing appropriate medical  care for the subject. If DKA is 
suspected, regardless of the blood glucose level, the following assessments should be done 
immediately: physical exam and serum glucose, bicarbonate, electrolytes, and serum ketones . 
Laboratory values should be  measured STA T at a local laboratory. If ketoacidosis is likely, 
investigational product administration should be discontinued and immediate appropriate 
medical therapy, including insulin, should be initiated. A glucose infusion may be provided if 
necessary to avoid hy poglycemia during insulin therapy. Insulin treatment should continue 
until resolution of the ketoacidosis and stabilization of the subject’s clinical condition. 
Investigational product administration may be resumed following stabilization of the 
subject’s condition.   The investigator  should collect the data necessary for the completion of 
the DKA CRF.  
If symptoms suggestive of DKA may have occurred but are not ongoing, investigator should 
review available data in order to complete the DKA CRF. The investig ator may also perform 
laboratory assessment using local resources if necessary for clinical care.

follow -up examination, including a complete physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and 
clinical laboratory tests (hematolog y, serum chemistry, and glycemic control). The sponsor 
must be notified in the event that a subject withdraws or has been withdrawn from the study.  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014882] Operating Procedures ( SOPs) of the contract research organization 
(CRO ) and the sponsor. Review procedures will be implemented at the CRO for all 
documents that are gene rated in relation to the study.  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014883] atistical analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.2 or higher.  
In general, descriptive statistics (number of subjects [N], mean, standard deviation [SD], Q1, 
median, Q3, minimum and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables, and 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables.  
The primary efficacy non -inferiority test will be one -sided at 0.025 significance level. The 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) on the difference of HbA1c reduction 
between bexagliflozin and sitaglipt in will be used to determine the study’s conclusion. That 
is, if the upper bound of the CI is within 0.35%, then the primary objective of the study is 
met.  Superiority will be declared without additional statistical testing when the upper bound 
of the 95% CI for the difference in change from baseline at week 24  in HbA1c comparing 
bexagliflozin group with sitagliptin  group is less than 0.  
The secondary efficacy objectives will be tested at two -sided 0.05 significance level 
following a sequential testing pro cedure to control the overall type I error of 0.05. The 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested only if the primary efficacy assessment achieves 
significance, and following the hierarchy as below:  
1. Superiority test of the change in FPG in the bexagliflo zin group vs. the sitagliptin group 
at week [ADDRESS_1014884] of the change in body weight in subjects with baseline BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 in 
the bexagliflozin group vs. the  sitagliptin group at week [ADDRESS_1014885] of the change in SBP in the bexagliflozin group vs. the sitagliptin group 
at week 24  
 
The exploratory efficacy objectives and safety objectives will be analyzed descriptively.  
9.2 Determination of Sample Size  
Approximate total 374 subjects will be randomized and equally allocated to receive 
bexagliflozin tablets (20 mg) + sitagliptin tablets (pl acebo), or bexagliflozin tablets (placebo) 
+ sitagliptin tablets (100 mg)  
The sample size calculation for this study is based on a two group t -test with a one -sided 
significance at the 0.025 level and the following assumptions:  
1. The non -inferiority limit (m argin) for mean change from baseline to week 24  in HbA1c 
comparing bexagliflozin group to sitagliptin  group will be 0.35%  
2. The pooled SD for the change from baseline to week 24  in HbA1c for bexagliflozin 
group and sitagliptin  group will be 1.0%  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014886] wi th 90% 
power at a 0.025 level of significance. A sample size of 187 per arm has been selected to 
account for approximate 8% drop -out rate and to allow adequate safety evaluation. The total 
sample size for this study will be 374 subjects.  
This study will be  conducted at multiple investigative sites and will likely involve various 
numbers of subjects at each site. Enrollment will be on a competitive basis, but  will be 
capped at 30 subjects from each site.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
9.3.1  Intention -to-Treat Analysis Set 
All subjects who are randomized regardless of treatment adherence or availability of follow -
up data will be included in the intention -to-treat analysis set (ITT). All analyses of the ITT 
will be based on each subject’s randomized assigned treatment. The IT T analysis set will 
serve as the primary set for the efficacy analyses.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_1014887].  The Safety Analysis Set  is the primary analysis set 
for safety  evaluation . 
9.3.3  Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will include all subjects in the ITT who meet the study 
eligibility requirements and have no major protocol deviations that affect the validity of the 
efficacy measurements. Protocol deviations that may result in subject exclusion from the PP 
Analysis Set will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The su bject assignment to the 
PP analysis set will be determined prior to database lock. The PP analysis set will serve as 
the secondary set for efficacy assessments.  
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and  baseline characteristics will be summ arized descriptively based on the ITT 
and PP analysis set for each treatment group as well as for all subjects combined. Key 
variables include age, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline HbA1c values, BP, body weight, BMI,  
FPG level, eGFR, duration of diabetes and prior anti -diabetic treatment status at screening 
(including type of therapy used [metformin, SU, DPP -4 inhibitor, alpha -glucosidase inhibitor 
etc.). In general, baseline measurement is defined as the last measurement prior to the first 
dose of double -blind medication.

Confidential  Page 55 of 69 Global Versio n 2.0 9.4.1  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHO -DD), and include medications that are either started prior to the study 
treatment and continue to be taken during the study treatment period, or medications started 
after the start of study treatment. Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_742440].  
9.5 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
9.5.1  Hypotheses for the Primary Endpoint  
The null and alternative hypoth eses for the primary endpoint are:  
H0: µ bexagliflozin  - µ comparator  > δ 
Ha: µ bexagliflozin  - µ comparator  ≤ δ 
Where µ bexagliflozin  and  µ comparator  represent the mean change in HbA1c at week 24  from 
baseline for bexagliflozin and comparator groups, respectively. Non -inferiority margin δ is 
chosen to be 0.35% using clini cal judgment, with reference to relevant regulatory guidance.  
9.5.2  Statistical Methods for Primary Analyses  
For the primary endpoint , the treatment difference will be examined by [CONTACT_2329] a mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) . The model will 
include  treatment, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction , region  and the baseline HbA1c value 
as a fixed effect covariate. Least squares mean treatment differences between the 
bexagliflozin group and the comparator group at week [ADDRESS_1014888] correlation. If the model 
with the unstructured covariance structure does not converge, an autoregressive(1) 
covariance structure will be used.  
HbA1c values obt ained after the start of rescue medication will not be excluded in the 
analysis. These analyses will be conducted on both ITT (primary) and PP analysis sets, and 
conclusions can be considered more robust when both approaches support the non -inferiority 
of the treatment.  
In non -inferiority analysis, a CI is calculated to estimate the range of values in which the  
treatment difference  is likely to lie.  This CI is used to provide the basis for drawing the 
study’s conclusions.  In this specific test, if the 95% C I lies below the specified non -
inferiority margin 0.35 %, the results would lead to a conclusion of  non-inferiority  of 
bexagliflozin treatment to sitagliptin  treatment.  Superiority of bexagliflozin group over 
sitagliptin  group at week 24  in HbA1c change fro m baseline will be declared if the upper 
bound  of 95% CI is less than 0.  
Bexagliflozin Tablets   Theracos Sub, L LC 
Clinical Trial Protocol : THR -[ADDRESS_1014889] MI techniques; HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication 
will not be excluded.  
1. Missing data will be imputed  via LOCF, following which the MMRM will be repeated; 
HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication will be considered missing.  
2. HbA1c values collected after the start of rescue medication will be considered missing, 
and the MMRM analyses will  be re -performed.  
 
9.5.3  Analysis of  Dropouts Pattern  
The early termination rate is estimated to be 8%. To the extent possible, attempts will be 
made to minimize the amount of missing data through measures planned in the study 
conduct.  
The number, timing, patter n, reason for and possible implications of missing values in 
efficacy assessments will be investigated. The dropout patterns will be assessed by [CONTACT_5263] -
Meier plots if applicable to assess whether they differ between treatment groups.  
9.[ADDRESS_1014890] on the change in FPG in the bexagliflozin group vs. the 
sitagliptin group at week 24 , similar to the primary endpoint analysis method, MMRM 
ANCOVA  will be implemented (values obtained after the start of rescue medicatio n will not 
be excluded in the analysis) . The model will include  treatment , visit,  treatment -by-visit 
interaction, region and the baseline FPG value as fixed effects/covariates. Least squares mean 
treatment differences between the bexagliflozin group and th e comparator group will be 
estimated from the model. The corresponding 95% CI and p -value will be provided.  
The change in body weight for subjects with baseline BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 in the bexagliflozin 
group vs. the sitagliptin group at week 24, and the change in SBP in the bexagliflozin group 
compared with sitagliptin  group at week 24  will be analyzed using the same method.  
All analyses will be conducted in ITT analysis set. A hierarchical testing procedure will be 
applied to above three endpoints in the sequen ce provided in Section 9.1. 
9.7 Other Efficacy Analyses  
Changes in HbA1c, FPG, SBP, and body weight for all subjects during the treatment period 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_64200] (i.e., Weeks 6, 12,  18, 24, …, etc .). In 
addition, these endpoints may be analyzed using a similar MMRM model as used for the 
primary analysis of HbA1c to compare two treatment groups  at different time points .

over time. Generalized estimation equation (GEE) logistic regression method may be utilized 
for assessment of treatment effects.  
Analyses will be conducted using ITT analysis set.  
9.8 Analysis of Safety  
Safety data include AEs, physical exam results, vital signs, ECG results, and clinical lab 
results including serum chemistry, hematology, serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glycemic control parameters 
and urinalysis. Observed data will be summarized by [CONTACT_532602].  
9.8.1  Adverse Events  
AEs will be mapped to preferred term and body system using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. AEs that begin at or after the first 
administration of double -blind study medication or existing AEs that worsen in severity after 
the first dose of double -blind study medication are considered treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAE). The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be summarized for 
each treatment group by [CONTACT_14340]. Further summaries 
by [CONTACT_742441]. Drug -related AE will 
be considered those to be at least possibly related to the study treatments based on the 
investigators assessment.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting serious A Es, and the number and 
percentage of subjects reporting AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will also be 
summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_14340].  
9.8.[ADDRESS_1014891] per 100 
patient years will also be summarized. Additional analyses will be specif ied in the statistical 
analysis plan to evaluate other event associated safety parameters and potential risks in 
subpopulations based on age, gender, or other baseline characteristics .

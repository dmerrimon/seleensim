2 Study  design  
The trial is a multi -center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial of AMZ001 for the 
treatment  of knee osteoarthritis symptoms. The trial also includes a single -blind component, 
consisting of Voltaren® 1 % gel. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of once or twice daily application of AMZ001 during a 28 -day period in subjects with 
radiographic and symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in either one or both knees.  
A total of appr oximately 440 subjects are planned to be randomized. The subjects will be 
randomized in a ratio of 3:3:3:2 with approximately 120 subjects in each of the three double - 
blinded treatment groups (AMZ001 BID, AMZ001 QD and placebo) and approximately 80 
subjec ts in the single -blinded treatment group (comparator Voltaren® gel 1 %).  
The trial consists of three phases: screening, treatment, and foll ow-up, as illustrated in Table 1 .

2.2 Determination of sample  size 
 
The power is determined from expected changes in the primary endpoint of the change from 
baseline in pain as evaluated by [CONTACT_67065] -score. The power calculation is based on 
data from a 4 -week double -blind diclofen ac sodium 2 % topi[INVESTIGATOR_67057] (Wadsworth et al. 2016). In this study using the WOMAC LK (Likert) 3.1 
scale (0 -4 for each question), a decrease from baseline in WOMAC pain sub -score (5 questions) 
was recorded  in the diclofenac treatment group  of 4.5 (SD 4.5) and in the placebo group 3.6 (SD 
4.2). 
The estimated common SD of 4.4 in the LK 3.1 scale can be converted to a SD of 4.4 * 2.5 = 11 
in the NRS scale. Calculations based on a series of assumptions are show n below in Table 2. 
With the assumptions of the SD of 11 (NRS scale), 120 subjects enrolled in each of the double - 
blinded treatment arms, 10 % dropout rate, normal distribution, 5 % level of significance two - 
sided, 80 % pow er, the study will be powered to d etect a treatment difference in WOMAC pain 
sub-score between AMZ001 BID and placebo of 4.2 on the NRS scale.

Study ID:  AMZ001 -[ADDRESS_73254] only performed for the primary endpoint.  
It should be noted that the current trial is not designed or powered to evaluate superiority o f 
AMZ001 compared to Voltaren® gel, but th e trial will provide important information on onset and 
duration of action of AMZ001 to guide future, larger trials. Also, the trial is not powered to 
evaluate superiority of AMZ001 applied twice daily as compared to once daily, but the trial will 
provide information on efficacy, safety, and tolerability of twice daily administration as compared 
to once daily administration.  
Furthermore, the trial will be used to finalize the psychometric validation of the Pain Diar y and 
the Satisfaction Questionnaire.  
 
2.3 Blinding  
 
This is a double -blind study of AMZ001 (QD and BID regimens) versus placebo, which also 
includes a single -blind active comparator (Voltaren® gel 1 %).  
Due to lack of availability of Voltaren® gel 1 % in metered dose -dispensers identical to that of t he 
doub le-blinded IMP, as well as due to differences in approved daily dose application schedules, 
full masking of Voltaren® gel 1 % was not considered feasible for this trial.  Instead, the 
Voltaren® gel 1 % is single -blinded to conceal the brand of the p roduct.  The single -blinded 
product is labelled identically to other IMPs in the trial. All double -blinded IMPs will be 
indistinguishable in appearance of the container, the label, as well as the gel appearance, smell 
and texture. The appearance of the sing le-blinded Voltaren® gel tube will be masked to fully 
cover any branding  information.  
Neither subject, investigator nor staff working on the study will be aware of treatment allocation 
to the double -blind treatment groups. The dispensation type (metered do se-dispenser vs. gel tube) 
and required frequency of application risks unblinding of the allocation of Voltaren® gel for the 
subjects allocated to the single -blinded treatment groups. Due to the difference in primary 
packaging material, study staff will be  indire ctly unblinded to allocations to the Voltaren® gel 
treatment group.  
As the primary efficacy data analyses will be performed on the double -blinded treatment groups, 
the risk of bias associated with single -blind ed trea tment groups is considered irrelevant to the 
main data output.  
All summaries produced before database lock will be presented using dummy treatments and this 
will be explicitly stated.  
 
2.4 Randomization  
The screening/randomization procedure will be cent rally m anaged through an electronic 
Interactive Web Responding System integrated in the eCRF.

Page 11 of 22  Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of four treatment groups with an allocation ratio of 
3:3:3:2. Each of the three double -blinded treatment gr oups (AMZ0 01 BID, AMZ001 QD and 
placebo) will be randomized with approximately [ADDRESS_73256] of topi[INVESTIGATOR_67058]001 gel compared with placebo. The single - 
blinded group of the comparator of Voltaren® gel 1 % w ill be randomized with approximately [ADDRESS_73257] will be classified according to the below definitions of the Intention -to-Treat (ITT), 
Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT), Per -Protocol (PP) and Safety  (SAF) analysis sets at the Blind 
Data Review Meeting before breaking the blind. The decisions will be made by [CONTACT_67066].  
Outputs on demographics and baseline characteristics, medical history, prior medicat ion and 
concomitant medication will be performed using the ITT, mITT, PP and SAF analysis sets. 
Subject disposition will be summarized for all screened subjects and protocol deviations will be 
summarized for the ITT analysis set. Exposure and compliance wi ll be performed using the ITT 
and SAF analysis sets.  
 
3.1 Intention -to-Treat Analysis Set (Full analysis  set) 
 
The ITT analysis set will include all subjects randomly allocated to a treatment, based on the 
intention to treat “as randomized” principle (i.e. the pla nned regimen rather than the actual 
treatment given in case of any difference).

efficacy of the treatment, where the nat ure of such clinical trial deviations will be defined 
before breaking the blind. Major protocol violations could include al though not limited to 
major deviations of inclusion/exclusion criteria and use of prohibited  medication.

treatment received will be decided based on below categ ories and documented. For subjects 
receiving treatment as per the randomization, actual treatment is identical to planned treatment.  
Since dispensation of IMP occurs at  multiple timepoints (Visit 2, Visit 4 and as needed), subjects 
will fall into one of the following three actual treatment categories:  
1. IMP is dispensed correctly on all  occasions.  
2. IMP is consistentl y dispensed incorrectly on all occasions i.e. the subject received the 
same (incorrect) treatment throughout the study and the IMP received corresponds to one 
of the study treatment  groups.  
3. IMP is dispensed incorrectly on one or more occasions and the subj ect did not consistently 
receive IMP corresponding to one of the study treatment  groups.  
In order not to bias the safety reporting of the study treatment groups, any subjects falling into 
category 3 above will be included in the SAF under a separate treatm ent group ‘AMZ – 
misallocations’ and will therefore not be included in the safety summaries for any of the study 
treatment groups.  
The SAF will be used for all safety and tolerability summar ies. 
4 Statistical analyses and presentation of  data  
4.1 General consid erations  
 
Descriptive summaries and analyses when applicable will be presented for the following treatment 
groups: AMZ001 BID, AMZ001 QD, Placebo and Voltaren 1%.  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_73261] at a 5% si gnificance level. Results 
from analyses will be presented with estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p -values.  
Numerical data will be presented in summary tables by [CONTACT_67067] (n), the number of 
missing values (missing), arithmetic mean , standard deviation (SD), median, first and third 
quartiles (Q1, Q3), minimum (min) and maximum (max) values. The mean, median, Q1 and Q3 
will be reported to one decimal pl ace more than the raw data, the standard deviation to two 
decimal places more than the raw data and the minimum and maximum values to the same 
precision as the raw data. The summary statistics presented for categorical data will be the

of subj ects in each category. Number of events will also be reported where  applicable.  
All data will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], subject and time point (if applicable). Age and sex will 
be displayed in all listings.  
 
4.2 Efficacy  
 
4.2.1 Primary efficacy  analysis  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will include data from the double -blind treatment groups only.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Derivatio n of primary e ndpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline at week 4 in the WOMAC pain sub -score in the 
target knee.  
The WOMAC pain sub -score is derived from WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index questionnaire as the 
sum of questions 1 to 5. It takes values in the range 0 -50, where higher values indicate greater  
pain. For c onvenience and ease of interpretation, all WOMAC scores (including the pain sub - 
score) will be normalised to a 0 -100-point scale for data analysis.  
For the primary endpoint,  
 
normalised WOMAC  pain sub -score = (WOMAC pain sub -score/50) * 100  
The full WOMAC questionnaire is assessed for the target knee at baseline (Visit 2), week 1 (Visit  
3) week 2 (Visit 4), week 3 (Visit 5) and week  4 (Visit 6).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Summary presentations and method of  analysis  
 
The absolute values and the absolute change from baseline in the WOMAC pain sub -score will be 
summarized over time by [CONTACT_1570].  
The primary analys is will use a r estricted maximum likelihood based repeated measures mixed 
model (MMRM) on the dependent variable absolute change from baseline of the WOMAC pain 
sub-score. The analysis will include covariates of baseline value (WOMAC pain sub -score), 
treatment, timepoint , sex, country, the subject characteristic of unilateral/bilateral knee OA at 
baseline (defined by [CONTACT_67068]) 
and treatment -by-timepoint interaction. An AR(1) covariance structu re will be used  to model the

where response is the change from baseline in WOMAC pain sub -score and baseline is the 
WOMAC pain sub -score at baseline, status is the categorical variable of either unilateral or 
bilateral knee OA at baseline and visit is the study timepoint.  
Least square mean estimates of change from baseline in WOMAC pain sub -score along with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) will be presented at each time -point for each treatment group.  
Estimated treatment differences at week 4 between all treatment groups along  with associa ted 
95% confidence intervals and p -values will be presented. P -values will be interpreted according 
to the hierarchical step -down testing procedure specified for the primary objective and also with 
consideration as to whether they are secondar y or explorat ory objectives . Model -estimated least 
square means and associated 95% CI of change from baseline in WOMAC pain sub -score will 
be plotted over time by [CONTACT_1570].  
The p rimary efficacy analysis will be based on the mITT. The robustness of the results of the 
primary analysis will be investigated by a sensitivity analysis based on the PP.  
Further investigation of the robustness of the primary results (in particular, the inf luence of time 
and covariates)  may be performed, if deemed necessary.

WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index  
The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index consists of 24 questions about aspects of the target knee over 
the previous 24 hours. The questions are split into three sections: Pain , Stiffness and Difficulty 
Performing Daily Activ ities (i.e. Physical Function ). Each question is scored on a [ADDRESS_73264] ionnaire:  
 
WOMAC scores  Range (min – max)  Derivation  
Total score  0 - 240 Q1 + Q2 +….. + Q23 + Q24

Pain non -weight bearing sub -score  0 - 20 Q3 + Q4  
Stiffness  sub-score  0 - 20 Q6 + Q7  
Function sub -score  0 - 170 Q8 + Q9 +….. + Q23 + Q24  
 
For convenience and ease of interpret ation, all WOMAC derived scores will be normalised to a 0 - 
100-point scale for da ta analysis where, for each score

The full WOMAC questionnaire is assessed for the target knee at baseline (Visit 2), wee k 1 (Visit  
3) and weeks 2, 3 and 4.  
 
The WOMAC pain sub -scale is also completed at screening for both the left/right hips and the 
left/right knees. This is for the assessment of baseline status and eligib ility, the determination of 
the target knee and whether the subject has bilateral or un ilateral knee OA.  
 
Patient Global Assessment (PGA) questionnaire  
The PGA consists of a single question asking how a patient’s knee OA has affected their health 
during th e last 48 hours. It is scored on an 11 -point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, where  
higher scores represent a higher level of disease activity or worse health.  
 
The PGA is assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4.  
 
Intermittent and Constant OA Pain (ICOAP)  
The ICOAP consists of 11 items (questions) assessing pain in the target knee over the previous 
week. Each question is scored on a 5 -point scale as follows, where higher scores indicate more 
severe  pain:  
0 = no pain 
1 = mildly  
2 = moderately  
3 = severely  
4 = extremely  
The following scores are derived from answers to the ICOAP questi onnaire:  
 
ICOAP scores  Range  Derivation  
Total  0 - 44 Q1 + Q2 +….. + Q10 + Q11  
Constant pain  0 - 20 Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5  
Intermittent pain  0 - 24 Q6 + Q7 + Q8 + Q9 + Q10 + Q11  
 
All ICOAP scores will be normalised to a score out of 100 using the formulae:  
Normalized total pain score = (total pain score/44) * 100 
Normalized constant pain sub -score = (constant pain sub -score/20) *100  
Normalized inter mittent pain sub -score = (intermittent pain sub -score/24) *[ADDRESS_73266] can stand up and then sit down again in 30

exposure, compliance and rescue medication calculations.  
 
The time between baseline and first intake of rescue medication (days) will also be determined as  
 
Date of first intake of rescue medication – treatment start date  
 
For subjects that have first intake of rescue medication on the Visit 2 (treatment start) date, the

Work Productivity  and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire: Gen eral Health  
The WPAI General Health questionnaire consists of six questions. Responses to the questions are 
used to derive WPAI outcomes, which are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher 
numbers i ndicating greater impairment and less productivity , i.e. worse outcomes.  
 
The WPAI questions and derived endpoints are as follows:

1 = currently employed (YES/NO)  
2 = hours missed due to health problems 
3 = hours missed other reasons  
4 = hours actually worked  
5 = degree health affected pr oductivity while working (0 -10 11 -point NRS) 
6 = degree health affected regular activities (0 -10 11 -point NRS)  
 
WPAI derived endpoints  Derivation  
Percent work time missed due to health  Q2/(Q2+Q4)  
Percent impairment while working due to health  Q5/10  
Percent overall work impairment due to health  Q2/(Q2+Q4) + [(1 -(Q2/(Q2+Q4))) x (Q5/10)]  
Percent activity impairment due to health  Q6/10  
 
Derived scores are multiplied by 100 to express them in percentages.  
 
If any of the WPAI questions required to calculate  a given WPAI outcome is missing, no data 
imputation will be performed and the WPAI outcome will be set to missing . 
 
A note -to-file issued on 04JUN19 docum ents the strategy to be followed in cases where th e 
reported total number of working hours (the sum of hours in WPAI questions 2, 3 and 4) are 
considered outside the expected normal range (0 -70 hours/week) and thus are believed to be based 
on a misundersta nding of questions 2, [ADDRESS_73272] one of the fol lowing  criteria:  
 
• Report more than 70h work week at any time during the trial  OR 
• Report more than 60h work week at any time during the trial  AND  
o Increase of more than 80% in total work hours per week from one or more 
previous visits, with a defined minimum  reference value of 25 hours per  week  
o Decrease of more than 50% in total work hours per week form one or more 
previous visits, with a defined min imum reference value of 25 hours per  week.  
 
The algorithm will be applied prior to unblinding, to ensure unbias ed analysis of the valid data 
only. The data from the WPAI questionnaire not affected by [CONTACT_67070] 
(i.e. questions 1, 5 - if applicable - and 6) will not be excluded from analysis.  
 
The WPAI is assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2 a nd 4.  
 
EQ5D  
The EQ -5D is a standardized measure of health status that consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, anxiety/depression) each measured on 5 levels (no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe p roblems and extreme problems) and a

‘the worst health  you can imagine’ and 100 to the ‘the best health you can imagine’.  
The EQ5D is assessed at baseline, week [ADDRESS_73275] -OARSI responder criteria (Pham, et al., 2004) are based on the WOMAC pain 
and function sub -scores and the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) questionnaire.  
A subject is defined as a responder if they de monstrate either  
 
 
where high improvement is defined as  
• Relative improvement of ≥ 50% (i.e. relative change ≤ -50%) from baseline  AND  
• Absolute improvement of ≥ 20 (i.e. absolute change ≤ -20)) from baseline 
and moderate improvement is defined as  
• Relative improvement of ≥ 20% (i.e. relative change ≤ -20%)) from baseline  AND  
• Absolute improvement of ≥ 10 (i.e. absolute change ≤ -10)) from  baseline.  
and 
 
relative change = percentage change during the study  
= ((final score – baselin e score)/ baseline score) * 100 
absolute change = absolute change during the study  
= final score (normalised) – baseline score (normalised)  
In the situation that at least one of the three endpoints (i.e. WOMAC pain and function s ub-scores 
and PGA) required to assess the responder criteria is missing:  
• If the available endpoints satisfy the responder criteria, then the subject will be classified 
as a responder. (e.g. If a subject has high improvement on the WOMAC pain sub -score but 
the WOMAC function sub -score and PGA are missing the n the subject is a  responder).  
• If the available endpoints do not satisfy the responder criteria AND there is no possibility 
that they could have been a responder when considering possible values for the missing 
score(s), then the response will be set to no n-response. (e.g. If a subject does not achieve 
moderate response on either the WOMAC pain sub -score or the PGA and the WOMAC 
function sub -score missing then the subject is a  non-responder).

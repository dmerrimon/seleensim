and Efficacy of a Fixed Dose Combination GSP 301 Nasal Spray Compared with Two Placebo Nasal Spray  
Formulation s in Subjects ( Aged 12 Years and Older) w ith Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR)  
Protocol Number : GPL/CT/2014/018/III  
Study Number : GSP 301-[ADDRESS_868805] (s)/Code(s) 
• GSP 301 nasal spray (GSP 301 NS): olopatadine hydrochloride 665 μg and mometasone furoate 25 μg  
nasal spray (NS)  
• GSP 301 placebo NS pH 
• GSP 301 placebo NS pH 
Name [CONTACT_3261] : Olopatadine hydrochl oride and mometasone furoate  
Phase of Development : Phase 3 
Study Rationale  
The ideal therapeutic agent for managing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) is one that effectively addresses the 
pathophysiology of both the early -phase reaction and the late-phase reaction of the condition .[ADDRESS_868806] indicated that taking both intranasal antihistamine and corticosteroid are more beneficial than either medication alone in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis  (SAR).
[ADDRESS_868807] cell stabilizing properties .1 Olopatadine hydrochloride NS has 
been approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) as Patanase® NS for the relief of the symptoms of SAR in adults (in 2008, 
as 2 sprays per nostril twice daily [BID]; total daily dose of 5320 µg) and in children 6 years of age or older (in 
2009, as 1 spray per nostril B ID). The efficacy and safety data from adult, adolescent, and pediatric subjects in 
clinical studies of Patanase® NS are provided in the US Prescribing Information (USPI) .9  
Mometasone furoate NS (Nasonex® NS, 50 µg/spray) has been approved in the US for the treatment of nasal 
symptoms of AR in patients aged 12 years and older as 2 sprays in each nostril once daily (QD) (200 µg total daily dose) and as 1 spray per nostril QD (100 µg total daily dose) for ch ildren aged 2 to 11 years. Other indications 
include treatment of nasal congestion associated with SAR in patients aged 2 years or older; prophylaxis of SAR in patients aged 12 years or older, and treatment of nasal polyps in adults. The efficacy and safety data from adult, adolescent, and pediatric subjects in clinical studies of Nasonex
® NS are provided in the USPI .[ADDRESS_868808] containing an intranasal 
corticosteroid and intranasal antihistamine is available for SAR treatment (D ymista USPI),15 but no such option is 
available for patients suffering from PAR in the US. Based on the results from a Phase 2 study conducted with 
GSP 301 (Study GSP 301- 201),  (olopatadine hydrochloride 665 μg and 
mometasone furoate 25 μg) was found to be op ma ysafe and effective for the treatment of SAR in adult and 
adolescents and will be further evaluated in the Phase [ADDRESS_868809] population will be adult and adolescent subjects (aged ≥12 years) with PAR. The subjects 
will be asked to take their daily double -blind, study medication for a period of [ADDRESS_868810]/CT/2014/018/III

1 year. Based on an estimated attrition rate of 25% at the 6 month time point and 50% by [ADDRESS_868828] 6, 30, and 52  weeks of 
treatment  will be ana lyzed using an analysis of covariance (A NCOVA) model adjusting for  study treatment group, 
site, and baseline (defined as the average of the last [ADDRESS_868829] 4 days of the 
run-in period from the Day -3 AM assessment  to the AM assessment on the day of randomization). At least 2 out of 
4 assessments (scores) should be available in order to calculate  the baseline scores for the AM rTNSS and iTNSS  
(linear, continuous covariate). Least square means (LSMs) of the treatment differences and associated 95% 
confidence intervals ( 95% CIs) and p -values will be presented. A multiple, imputation -based approach where 
complete data sets are drawn will be used for handling missing data in the efficacy analysis. The imputation model 
will be defined and fully detailed in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
Changes from baseline in rTNSS and iTNSS at the end of each week of treatment and changes from baseline in 
individual nasal symptom scores over the first 6, 30, and 52 weeks (and at the end of each treatment week) of the 
treatment period will be analyzed in a similar manner as described above.  
Changes from baseline in RQLQ(S) at Weeks 6, 30, and 52 will be analyzed for the FAS and the RQLQ(S) Analysis 
Set using ANCOVA models adjusting for study treatment group, site, and baseline RQLQ(S) (linear, continuou s 
covariate). For subjects who withdrew early from the study , the RQLQ(S) score at their discontinuation visit will be 
used. 
The analyses of RCAT results will be similar to the RQLQ(S) analyses except the RQLQ(S) analysis set will not apply.

5 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
5.1 Introduction 
Rhinitis is defined as inflammation of the nasal membranes and is characterized by [CONTACT_648555]: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal itching, and nasal obstruction. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common cause of rhinitis and represents a global health 
problem affecting approximately 10% to 30% of the general adult population and its prevalence is increasing worldwide .
1,2 In the [LOCATION_002] (US), it affects 10% to 30% of the adult general 
population and up to 40% of children. This accounts for [ADDRESS_868833] medical costs (physician services, diagnostics, medications, etc.) nearly doubled from US $6.1 billion in 2000 to US $11.2 billion in 2005.
1  
Allergic rhinitis  has been traditionally subdivided into seasonal, perennial, and occupational 
rhinitis and involves the inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose, eyes, eustachian tubes, middle ear, sinuses, and pharynx. Inflammation of the mucous membranes is char acterized 
by a complex interaction of inflammatory mediators but ultimately is triggered by [CONTACT_648556] E ( IgE)-mediated response to extrinsic proteins such as pollens or molds (food 
allergies rarely cause AR except as p art of a multi-organ reaction) .
3,4,[ADDRESS_868834] for ≥[ADDRESS_868835] cells, resulting in aggregation of IgE receptors (FcεRI) and the release of chemical mediators including histamine. Binding of histamine to the histamine H1 receptor 
increases paracellular permeability, which contributes to the early -phase response of AR , 
characterized by [CONTACT_648557], rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Infiltration of inflammatory cells (activated eosinophils and T-helper type 2 cells) into the nasal mucosa is induced by [CONTACT_147807] -
attractant factors (including various cytokines) and results in edema of the nasal mucosa. This inflammation, the late -phase response of AR , develops [ADDRESS_868836] cell stabilizers, leukotriene modifiers, anticholinergics, and allergen immunotherapy .1,7,8 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (intranasal) antihistamines (histamine H1 receptor antagonists) are prescribed to treat the 
nasal itch, sneezing, and rhinorrhea caused by [CONTACT_648558] .
6 Intranasal corticosteroids inhibit both early and late 
reactions and reduce IgE production and eosinophilia by [CONTACT_648559] 4 ( IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13.
3,[ADDRESS_868837]: Mechanism of Action 
Olopatadine is a histamine H1 -receptor antagonist. Intranasal antihistamines have the potential 
to provide quick symptomatic relief but do not provide substantial benefits for the late- phase 
reaction of the allergic response that  leads to nasal congestion. The antihistaminic activity of 
olopatadine has been documented in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans .[ADDRESS_868838]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868839] a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation.
10 
Mometasone furoate has a high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a highly lipophilic nature; these characteristics contribute to its minimal systemic absorption and prolonged nasal contact [CONTACT_5586].  
5.3 Preclinical Experience  
The toxicity of both olopatadine hydrochloride and mometasone fuorate has been extensively assessed in multiple species by [CONTACT_648560]. The Sponsor has conducted a 13- week intranasal toxicity study in rats in order to 
assess the potential toxicity of GSP 301 nasal spray (GS P 301 NS ) and t  
 GSP 301 NS 
(6650 μg/mL olopatadine hydrochloride and 250 μg/mL mometasone furoate [same as the formulation planned for the Phase 3 clinica l studies]) was administered to rats by [CONTACT_648561] 4 times daily. The high dose represented overages of 2.3- fold based on nasal surface area 
and approximately 50-fold on a mg/kg basis to the proposed dose to be studied in the Phase [ADDRESS_868840] been conducted for both olopatadine 
hydrochloride and mometasone furoate in rats for up to 6 months and in dogs for up to 
12 months. Both compounds showed no nasal irritancy at concentrations equivalent to, or slightly greater than, those proposed in the fixed dose combination ( FDC) GSP [ADDRESS_868841] on fertility  was observed with mometasone furoate but olopatadine hydrochloride 
administered orally to rats at 400 mg/kg/day resulted in a decrease in fertility index and reduced mean implantations. No effect on fert ility was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 
100 times the maximum human dose of 4800 μg/day on a body surface area basis). 
Olopatadine hydrochloride was not teratogenic in rabbits and rats by [CONTACT_149260]; however, 
mometasone furoate has been shown to induce teratogenicity in multiple species by [CONTACT_648562][INVESTIGATOR_648525] (reduced ossification) considered to be 
glucocorticoid class effects. It is known that the sensitivity of rodents to teratogenic effects of 
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868842]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.0 
 Date 31-Aug-2016  
corticosteroids is greater than for humans; however, mometasone furoate should be used during 
pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. Difficult and 
prolonged parturition observed in Segment I and Segment III reproduction studies may be related to the progestational
 effect of mometasone furoate . Both molecules are defined as Pregnancy 
Category C.  
Olopatadine hydrochloride tested negative for antigenic potential in mice and guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_648526]-sensitizing in the guinea pig maximization test.   
5.4 Clinical Experience 
A proof-of-concept study was conducted to evaluate FDC GSP 301 NS  in the treatment of 
seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). This was a double-blind, double- dummy, randomized, 
parallel-group, comparative environmental chamber study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of 2  Sponsor-formulated FDC products of olopatadine hydrochloride and 
mometasone furoate nasal spray ( NS) (referred to as Molo 1 and Molo 2 in that study) compared 
with an approved FDC of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_648527] (Dymista
 
NS), an approved olopatadine hydrochloride NS (Patanase® NS), and Sponsor-formulated 
placebo in subjects with SAR. The study population consisted of 180 subjects who were allergic to ragweed allergen and had SAR for the 2 years prior to study entry. Subjects were treated with study medication  for 2 weeks. Both Sponsor-formulated FDC products were superior to placebo 
and Patanase
® NS for the change from baseline in mean instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom 
Score (iTNSS). However, the Sponsor-formulated FDC products were not statistically superior 
to Dymista NS but showed numerical improvement . 
In addition, two Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and a large Phase 2 study were 
completed. The Phase 1 studies were open -label, 3-period, 3-treatment, crossover, randomized 
studies with 30 healthy volunteers in each study. The results of the two Phase 1 studies 
demonstrated that the olopatadine systemic exposure of the FDC GSP 301 NS is similar  to the 
olopatadine exposure of the marketed monotherapy Patanase® NS and suggested that the 
mometasone furoate systemic exposure of the FDC GSP  301 NS is generally comparable to the 
mometasone furoate exposure of the marketed monotherapy Nasonex® NS, except for a higher 
maximum plasma concentration (C max) for the FDC GSP 301 N S 
compared with Nasonex® NS treatment. It is unlikely that the difference in mometasone furoate 
systemic exposure seen in this study (especially in terms of increased C max) is clinically 
significant concerning systemic safety . It should be noted that both of these Phase 1 studies used 
single doses of the GSP 301 NS formulation referred to as GSP 301- 1 NS (
formulation of the FDC  
 in the Phase 2 Study GSP 301-201.

 Date 31-Aug-2016  
properties .3 The efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate NS,  50 µg (Nasonex® NS 200 µg 
total daily dose, QD) in the prophylaxis and treatment of nasal symptoms of SAR, nasal 
congestion associated with SAR and the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) have been evaluated in 18 controlled trials, and 1 uncontrolled clinical trial, in approximately 3000 adults (aged 17 to 85 years) and adolescents (aged 12 to 16 years) .
[ADDRESS_868844] during long- term use. The US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) 
guidance on the development of drug product for AR recommends that a new product should be 
evaluated in a long -term (52 weeks) safety study.  Therefore, the optimal dose and regimen 
determined based on the Phase [ADDRESS_868845]  is essential to maintain blinding for 
efficacy purposes; the low pH in the placebo treatment may impact the interpretation of the safety data because the frequencies of com monly occurring adverse events (AEs) in the GSP301 
NS group may be underestimated when compared with the low pH placebo treatment group. To address this issue, an additional placebo NS with a higher pH of approximately  is being evaluated in this study as recommended by [CONTACT_55257]. Thus, the primary objective of this 
study is to compare the long-term safety and tolerability of GSP 301 NS with two GSP 301 
placebo NS formulations over 52 weeks of treatment in subjects (aged ≥ 12 years) with PAR. 
Additionally, the long- term efficacy of GSP 301 NS will also be evaluated.   
5.6 Benefit-Risk Assessment  
Olopatadine hydrochloride NS (Patanase
® NS) has been approved for the relief of the symptoms 
of SAR in adults and children ≥[ADDRESS_868846] common (>1% of patients ) 
adverse reactions included bitter taste, headache, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], pharyngolaryngeal pain, post- nasal 
drip, cough, and urinary tract infection.9 
Mometasone furoate NS (Nasonex® NS) is also well tolerated, effective, and safe in the 
treatment of seasonal and perennial AR. Nasonex® NS was approved in the US in [ADDRESS_868847] common adverse reactions (≥5% of patients ) included headache, 
viral infection, pharyngitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] , cough, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], sinusitis, 
dysmenorrhea, and musculoskeletal pain.10   
The currently approved dose of olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanase® NS, 665 μg, equivalent to 
600 μg olopatadine as base) monotherapy in adults and adolescents ≥12 years old with SAR is 
2 sprays in each nostril BID. The currently approved dose of mometasone furoate (Nasonex® NS, 
50 μg) monotherapy in adults and adolescents ≥12 years old with AR is 2 sprays in each nostril QD. Thus, the approved total daily doses for the monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920] 5320 μg olopatadine

it 12). 
No scheduled post- treatment follow -up visit is planned for this study. However, subjects will be 
followed up if there is any ongoing AE or for any other reason as per the Investigator’s and 
Sponsor’s discretion.  
A telephone follow-up will be carried out for this study for any reason as per the Investigator’s 
judgment. If needed, additional unscheduled visits may be conducted to ensure subject safety or to perform other study-related procedures at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
No extension phase is planned for this study. 
7.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups  
This will be a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in 
approximately 600 subjects with PAR. These subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment 
arms in a ratio of 4:1:1 . Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885] . 
The study is designed as a double-blind study to reduce treatment and randomization bias. The 
overall study design is consistent with other similar studies reported in the literature. Furthermore, the overall study design is also based on the FDA guidance document for Allergic 
Rhinitis: Clinical Development Programs for Drug Products by [CONTACT_55257].
14 
This current study is planned to compare the long- term safety and efficacy of GSP 301 NS to 
2 different GSP 301 placebo NS formulations as agreed at an End-of- Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting 
with the FDA.  
 All NS bottles for all treatment groups will be 
identical in appearance. Thus, other than the active components and/or pH of the placebo formulations (as appropriate), there are no other differences in the formulations or the bottles of the 3 treatments .

9.[ADDRESS_868862] Discontinuation/Withdrawal Criteria  
A subject may volunta rily discontinue study participation at any time  after giving informed 
consent and before the completion of the last visit of the study.  Subjects may also be withdrawn 
from study drug treatment at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, noncompliance, or administrative reasons. The Investigator  may also discontinue the subject’s 
study participation at any time at his/her discretion  and for any reason .  
The reasons for subject withdrawal will be recorded and may include, but are not limited to: 
1. Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_648553].   
2. Development of a serious or intolerable AE that necessitates discontinuation at the discretion 
of the Investigator ( AE section of the CRF/eCRF must be completed; includes serious 
adverse event [ SAE], death). 
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868863]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.0 
 Date 31-Aug-2016  
3. At the discretion of the Investigator, when he/she believes continued participation is not in 
the best interest of the subject.  
4. At the discretion of the Investigator, when the subject does not adhere to the study procedures. 
5. A protocol deviation that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85736], warrants discontinuation from the study. 
In the case of premature discontinuation, the reason must be documented. The Investigator (or 
designee) must document the reason for withdrawal in the Study Conclusion section of the CRF/eCRF.   
All follow-up assessments should be conducted as  outlined for the Final Visit/Discontinuation  
Visit (Visit 12) (Appendix 1) . Every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_256856] a follow -up 
if the subject has not returned to the clinic for scheduled visits (lost- to-follow up subject) to 
ensure the safety of the subject . If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further 
evaluation will be performed and no additional data or medical records will be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before withdrawal of consent. 
A subject who discontinues study treatment early but does not withdraw consent, should return 
for end of study assessments, as noted in Section  11.4.   
The investigator will: 
• inquire about the reason for withdrawal,  
• request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), and  
• request that the subject return for the Final Visit/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 12).   
If the subject refuses to attend the clinic, efforts will be made and documented, to perform the end of study assessments; collection of visit data during a telephone call is permitted.  
The investigator must request follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs/SAEs. As a minimum, at the end of the study, the Investigator should consult public records to 
determine the subject’s circumstances, e.g. vital status, incarceration or relocation.  
Discontinued subjects will not be replaced.

adequately train the subjects on the proper use of the NS bottle (Appendix 2) . At each 
subsequent visit, site personnel will review instruction s on the proper use of the NS bottle with 
the subject and prime the NS bottle as needed. The priming process must be completed in such a 
way as to avoid any possible inhalation and contamination by [CONTACT_423].  
Each subject wil l be provided with single-blind, placebo, run- in medication ( GSP 301 placebo 
NS pH  for use until the Randomization Visit (Visit 2). Subjects will self -administer the first 
dose of the single-blind GSP 301 placebo NS pH  in the presence of the Investigator or designee during the Screening Visit ( Visit 1). Subjects should be instructed NOT to administer 
the single -blind study medication on the day of the Randomization Visit ( Visit 2). 
At the Randomization Visit (Visit 2 ), each subject will be pro vided with double-blind study 
medication according to the randomization scheme. The site personnel w ill review instruction s 
on the proper use of the NS bottle with the subject and prime the NS bottle as needed. The 
priming process must be completed in such a way as to avoid any possible inhalation and contamination by [CONTACT_423]. The first dose of double-blind study medication (AM dose on 
Day 1) will be self-administered in the clinic in the presence of the Investigator or designee 
during the Randomization Visit (Visit 2). All subsequent doses will be administered at home. 
The last scheduled dose will be the on the day before the Final Visit/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 12). Study medication  shou d not be taken (either at home or at the clinic) on the

Overdose information for each individual component of GSP 301 NS  (approved monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) 
is provided in the prescribing information and outlined here .
9,10 
Olopatadine hydrochloride: There have been no reported overdoses with olopatadine hydrochloride NS (Patanase
® NS). Symptoms of antihistamine overdose may include drowsiness. 
There is no known specific antidote to olopatadine hydrochloride NS. Should overdose occur, symptomatic or supportive treatment is recommended, taking into account any concomitantly 
ingested medications.  
Mometasone furoate: No data are available on the eff ects of acute or chronic overdose with 
mometasone furoate monohydrate NS (Nasonex
® NS). Overdose is unlikely to require any 
therapy because of the negligible (<0.1%) systemic bioavailability of mometasone furoate and 
the absence of acute drug -related systemic findings in clinical studies; however, observation 
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -initiation of the appropriate prescribed dosage is recommended .

10.4 Blinding and Unblinding Procedures  
This study is designed as a double-blind study. The blinding will be maintained by [CONTACT_648567]. Additionally, an unblinded 
qualified person not associated with the study team  will facilitate the randomization process  to 
ensure that  the double-blind design of the study is maintained. 
In case of any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding or unblinding due to a SAE) of 
the IPs, the Investigator should promptly document and explain it to the Sponsor. The Sponsor’s medical monitor or delegate should be contact[CONTACT_648568], depending on the circumstances. The Investigator will open the code break card for the subject  under consideration only if knowledge of  the randomized treatment is required for the 
treatment of the AE or SAE. In the event of a code break, t he following minimum information 
will be recorded in a memo to file, which will be included in the CSR:  
1. Date of the code break  
2. Identification of person(s) requesting the code break 
3. Reason for breaking the code 
4. Investigator's signature  
10.5 Preparation, Receipt,  Storage, Dispensing and Accountability  
The IP should be stored upright between 15° to 25°C (59 °F to 77°F) and protected from light. It 
should not be frozen or refrigerated. Subject s will be instructed on the storage conditions for the 
IP. The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for IP accountability at the site and its documentation. The Investigator must also ensure that the dispensing and recording of IP is conducted only by [CONTACT_4144]. The study medication  records must be readily available 
for inspection by [CONTACT_648569]/or auditor/regulatory agency personnel. No medication (used or unused) may be returned to the Sponsor, or disposed of at the investigational site, until 
the Sponsor’s Study Monitor has verified/reconciled the accuracy of the study medication 
records at the site and indicated whether the medication should be destroyed at the site or returned to the Sponsor. The Study Monitor must indicate the name [CONTACT_648599]. 
11 TIMING OF STUDY PROCEDURES  AND ASSESSMENTS  
Study procedures and assessments  are summarized across all study visits within the Schedule of 
Procedures and Assessments (Appendix 1).   
A focused ENT and eye examination will be done at all visits. If at any visit, clinically 
significant nasal ulceration, nasal mucosal erosion, and nasal septal perforation  are observed , or a 
finding at a previous visit has worsened  (as judged by [CONTACT_737]) , the subject should be 
referred to a qualified ENT specialist (medically qualified specialist qualified to evaluate and 
record these conditions, as judged by [CONTACT_737]) for further evaluation. A record from the specialist should be maintained, including the photographic evidence (imaging of nasal mucosa) 
of the assessment to allow pre - and post- treatment comparisons for AEs (see details in  Section 
12.4.11). The Sponsor will collect the de-identified information as part of the study data 
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868881]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868882] for participation/continued participation in the study will be 
at the Investigator’s discretion based on whether or not the protocol- defined selection criteria are 
met. These subjects may need to be re-screened due to delay in scheduling an ENT visit to obtain 
the necessary evaluation, as applicable, upon consultation with the Sponsor’s study team and approval. A thorough eye examination will also be performed by [CONTACT_648570].  
11.1 Screening  Visit: Visit 1 (Day -7 to -10) 
A Screening Visit (Visit 1) should be scheduled within 7 to 10 days before the Randomization 
Visit (Visit 2). Before any procedures or assessments  are performed , the nature of the study and 
the potential risks associated with the study must be explained to each subject  and written 
informed consent (and assent as applicable) must be obtained. Once informed consent/assent 
(and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] authorization as applicable) has been obtained, the following procedures and evaluations wil l be performed :  
1. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria  
2. Demographic data  
3. Medical and treatment history   
4. Concomitant medication evaluation  
5. Physical examination  
6. Vital signs  
7. Height and weight 
8. Clinical laboratory investigations (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis)

in the Early Withdrawal/Termination/Discontinuation pages of the CRF/eCRF. After completion 
of study participation , the subject will be treated, as needed, at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_256856] a follow-up if the subject has not returned to the clinic for scheduled visits (lost- to-follow up subject) to ensure the safety of the subject. 
If the subject is withdrawn because of an AE, the AE will be followed until the medical 
condition returns to baseline or is considered stable or chronic. The Sponsor (or designee) should be informed of all subjects withdrawn/discontinued for this reason. If there are multiple reasons for early withdrawal/discontinuation, the worst case scenario should be chosen.   
11.14 Unscheduled Visit  
An unscheduled visit (or telephone contact ) may be performed at any time during the study at the 
subject’s request or as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737]. The date and reason for the

AEs, concomitant medications/treatments, and results from procedures or tests). 
11.[ADDRESS_868893] demographic  information will be collected at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) . Demographic 
information  includes date of birth (or age), sex, race/ethnicity, and  any other study- specific 
demography. Allergen testing data will be recorded in the source documents and CRF/eCRF  with 
the description of the allergen. 
Medical and surgical history and current medical conditions will be recorded at the Screening 
Visit (Visit 1). All relevant medical and surgic al history within [ADDRESS_868894] be noted in the

12.2.2 Physician Assessment of Nasal Symptom Severity  
The PNSS will be derived from the intensity of the following nasal symptoms associated with 
AR: rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing .16 Clinicians will 
assess the severity of the above symptoms based on questioning the subjects (overall feeling 
since last visit) , the ENT and eye examination , and other observations. 
Whenever p ossible, the same medically qualified person should complete this assessment for the 
same subject throughout that subject’s participation in this study.  
12.2.3 Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire - Standardized Activities  
The RQLQ(S) (Appendix 4) used in this study is a disease- specific, validated, quality -of-life 
(QOL) questionnaire developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, and 
social) that are troublesome to adults and adolescents (aged ≥12 years) with allergies. The 
RQLQ(S) measures both atopic and non- atopic experiences as a result of subjects’ nasal and 
ocular symptoms.  
The RQLQ(S) has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non- nose/eye symptoms, practical 
problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) .[ADDRESS_868897] is  asked to recall their 
experiences during the previous week and to give responses on a 7-point scale (0=not troubled to 6=extremely t roubled) for the domains of activities, sleep, non- nose/eye symptoms, practical 
problems, nasal symptoms, and eye symptoms. The domain “emotional” utilizes a 7 -point scale 
(0=none of the time to 6=all of the time). This questionnaire should be completed as  the first 
activity of  visits that include this assessment.  
The self-administered version of the RQLQ(S) will be completed by [CONTACT_648571] (Visit 2), Treatment Visit 4 (Week 6), Treatment 
Visit 8 (Week 30), and the Final Visit/Discontinuation V isit (Visit 12 at Week 52). The 
RQLQ(S) administration must be the first procedure conducted at these study visits. 
The study site personnel and the Investigators will be provided with detailed instructions for conducting QOL assessments in order to achieve maximum compliance with the standards of 
QOL assessments in a clinical study environment and to maximize data quality. Caregivers or study site personnel are not allowed to interfere or communicate with the subject completing the questionnaire over and above re-stating the question(s) on the questionnaire exactly as written. Completion  of the questionnaire may take approximately 10 minutes depending on the 
experience and capability of the individual completing the questionnaire. After completion of the RQLQ(S), the site personnel will check the questionnaire for completeness and legibility.

An English- language version of the RQLQ(S) will be provided to all subjects who provide 
informed consent in English. However, if a subject consents in a language other than English, the 
RQLQ(S) will be provided to the subject in that language if  a validated version of the RQLQ(S) 
is available. If a validated version of the RQLQ(S) is not available in that language, then the subject will be exempt from completing the RQLQ(S).

moderate and severe as per  Section [IP_ADDRESS]), and SAEs; regular monitoring of hematology, 
biochemistry, and urinalysis values  (as applicable per the protocol or for safety reasons); periodic 
measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and physical examinations as detailed in the Schedule of 
Procedures and Asses sments (Appendix 1).  Additional details on the safety procedures 
performed in the study are detailed below. 
Any abnormal laboratory test result (hematology, biochemistry, or urinaly sis) or other safety 
assessment  (eg, 12-lead ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including any that  
worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the Investigator will be recorded as an AE or SAE . 
However, any clinicall y significant safety assessment that is  associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_114998]’s condition, will not be reported as an AE or SAE. 
12.4.1 Adverse Events  
The Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
The reference safety information for this study is the IB Section [IP_ADDRESS] Reference Safety 
Information within the Summary of Data and Guidance for Investigators.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered IP that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship w ith the treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
(new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not related to the IP. An AE includes any event, regardless of the presumed causality between the event and the IP.  
Events that, while not necessarily meeting the definition of AEs, should be treated as such because they may be reportable to Regulatory Authorities according to AE reporting regulations, whether or not considered causally associated with IP, include the following: 
• IP overdose, whether accidental or intentional. 
• IP abuse. 
• An event occurring from IP withdrawal. 
• Inadvertent or accidental IP exposure (e.g., product leaking or being spi[INVESTIGATOR_85763] a subject or care-giver). 
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from the IP.  
• Medication errors (i.e., incorrect route of administration, incorrect dosage, use of 
incorrect product).  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that l ed to 
the procedure is an AE . 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more sever e than expected for the subject’s 
condition. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment  of Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of AEs is classified as follows:  
Mild:  The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject. 
The AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic intervention. 
Moderate:  The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic 
intervention. 
The AE produces no sequelae.  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868902]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.0 
 Date 31-Aug-2016  
Severe: The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may lead to temporary 
inability to resume usual life pattern . 
The AE produces sequelae which require (prolonged) therapeutic intervention. 
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Section 12.4.2 for the definition of a SAE).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Relationship to Study Medication 
The relationship of AEs to study medication is classified as follows: 
Not Related:  
A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a reasonable 
possibility  
Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event 
• The presence of non -study treatment- related factors that ar e known to be associated w ith 
the occurrence of the event 
For each AE, the Investigator should answer the following question with Yes or No: 
• Was there a reasonable possibility (evidence) that the drug caused the adverse event?  
A reasonable possibility mea ns that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
NOTE: For subjects that have not started receiving study medication ( run-in or double-blind), the 
answer must be no. 
12.4.[ADDRESS_868903] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868904]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.0

• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648536], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. 
• Results in disability/incapacity.  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of re latively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_497589] [ADDRESS_868905] under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC and Investigators. 
A SAE must be reported to the Sponsor immediately or within [ADDRESS_868906] information 
provided below:  Fax:  + 44 1923 251137 
Email:  [EMAIL_1715]  
 When further information becomes available, the SAE Form should be updated with the new 
information and reported immediately using the same contact [CONTACT_3031]. Follow-up reports 
must be submitted to the Sponsor until the event resolves, the event stabilizes or the event returns 
to baseline if a baseline value is available.  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868907]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868908] after signing the informed consent form ( ICF) 
should be withdrawn from the study immediately and study medication should be discontinued 
immediately.  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be re ported to the Sponsor, using a 
Clinical Study Pregnancy F orm, immediately or within 24  hours of the Investigator learning of 
its occurrence. The report should contain as much information as possible and should be sent to:   
Fax:  + 44 1923 251137 
Email:  [EMAIL_1715]  
When further information becomes available, the Clinical Study Pregnancy Form should be 
updated with all new information and reported immediately using the same contact [CONTACT_85830].  The pregnancy must be followed up to determine the outcome (including premature 
termination) and status of mother and child, and this information must be sent to the Sponsor as above. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE. 
Additional information will be requested by [CONTACT_85829]. Any SAE that occurs  in association with a pregnancy that  is brought to t he Investigator’s 
attention after the subject has completed the study, and is considered by [CONTACT_648572], must be promptly reported to the Sponsor. The Investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy in formation on any female partner, of a male 
study subject, who becomes pregnant while the male partner is participating in this study . The 
Investigator must record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the 
Sponsor within 2 weeks of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The partner must also be 
followed up to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child must be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than [ADDRESS_868909].  
Serious adverse events  will be collected over the same time p eriod as stated above for AEs. 
However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., IP, protocol mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a concomitant medication 
that is a Sponsor product will be rec orded from the time a subject consents to participate in the 
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868910]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868911]. All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours, as indicated in Section 12.4.2. 
The Investigator will enquire about the occurrence of AEs/SAEs at every visit throughout the 
study (including Follow-up and Discontinuation visits where applicable)  by [CONTACT_648573]-leading ver bal question of the subject (or care-giver, where appropriate): 
• “Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?”  
All AEs not resolved by [CONTACT_648574]’s discontinuation in the study must be followed until the event resolves, the event stabilizes, or the event returns to baseline if a baseline value is available.  
All AEs regardless of seriousness, severity, or relationship to the study medication must be 
recorded on the AE  pages of the CRFs/eCRFs.  
Adverse events that meet the definition of a SAE must be reported on the SAE Form provided 
for this study. 
Adverse events must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical language. Do not use 
abbreviations or acronyms.  
For each AE , record only the diagnos is; do not report the characteristic signs and symptoms of 
the diagnosis as additional AEs.  If a diagnosis is unavailable, each sign and symptom should be recorded as an AE. Update the 
AE CRF/eCRF record with the relevant diagnosis alone, when this is ava ilable. 
In general, abnormal findings at screening should be recorded in the subject’s Medical History or in the Concurrent Conditions section in the CRF/ eCRF. However if, in the Investigator’ s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the finding is clinically significant and represents a condition that was not present at the signing of informed consent, then the finding must be reported as an AE . 
12.4.6 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Subjects should be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526]. The Schedule of Procedures and Assessments  (Appendix 1)  shows the visits and time points at which blood for 
clinical laboratory tests and urine for urinalysis will be collected in the study.  Lists of clinical 
laboratory tests are provided in  Appendix [ADDRESS_868912] of Clinical Laboratory Tests . A central 
laboratory will be used to measure laboratory parameters that are part of the safety assessments.  
12.4.7 Urine Pregnancy Testing  
Urine pregnancy testing will be completed by a dipstick evaluation at the Investigator’s clinical facility for all female subjects of childbearing potential as designated in the Schedules of Procedures and Assessments (Appendix 1)  or as indicated by [CONTACT_423]’s condition. The testing, 
based on beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG), will be carried out as per the manufacturer’s instructions. 
A positive finding during the Screening Visit (Visit 1) will prev ent the subject from study 
participation , and a positive finding at or after Randomization Visit (Visit 2) will require 
immediate Sponsor notification, discontinuation of study medication, and termination from the 
study.

12.4.8 Vital signs  
Vital signs evaluation will be performed as designated i n the Schedule of Procedures and 
Assessments (Appendix 1) . Vital sign evaluations will include sitting blood pressure (mm Hg) 
and pulse rate (beats/minute) after at least [ADDRESS_868914]. A medically qualified staff member will perform the vital sign evaluations. If a clinically important change in vital signs is observed, the assessment should 
be repeated in 5 to 10 minutes to confirm the change.  
12.4.9 Electrocardiogram s 
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of Procedures and 
Assessments (Appendix 1) . Subjects must be in the recumbent or supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a period of 
5 minutes prior to the 12- lead ECG.  
An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see Adverse 
Events, Section 12.4.1)  and the CRF /eCRF Completion Guidelines. In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the ECG abnormality will be recorded on the AE CRF/eCRF.  
For ECG abnormalities that meet criteria for an SAE (Section 12.4.2), the site must fax or email 
the SAE report, including the ECG tracing and report, to the Sponsor using the SAE form. 
12.4.10 Physical Ex aminations  
Physical examinations (comprehensive) will be performed as designated i n the Schedule of 
Procedures and Assessments  (Appendix 1) . Documentation of the physical examination will be 
included in the source documentation at the site. Significant findings at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be recorded on the Medical His tory and Current Medical Conditions CRF/ eCRF. 
Changes from screening physical examination or subsequent findings that meet the definition of 
an AE will be recorded on the AE CRF/ eCRF. 
Height (cm) and weight (kg) will also be measured at S creening Visit (Visit 1) and at the Final 
Visit / Discontinuation Visit (Visit 12). 
12.4.11 Focused Ears, Nose, and Throat and Eye Examination s 
Focused ENT and eye examination s will be performed as designated i n the Schedule of 
Procedures and Assessments (Appendix 1) . The Investigator or medically qualified designee will 
perform a thorough and focused ENT and eye examination. Whenever possible, the same medically qualified person should complete this assessment for the same subject throughout that subject’s participation in the study.  
Nasal examination s will be performed to assess signs of AR as well as known complications of 
intranasal corticosteroid or antihistamine use (e.g. , bleeding, perforation and ulceration). The 
focused ENT examination will include an evaluation of nasal irritation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], and additional nasal symptoms, graded according to the criteria provided as follows.

Throat examination will be conducted to evaluate evidence of throat irritation, candidiasis and postnasal drip. Any clinically significant new findings, not related to the study indication (P AR), 
evident at any visit after the Screening Visit (Visit 1 ), as judged by [CONTACT_737], should be 
captured as an AE and reported and recorded in the CRF/ eCRF. All findings at the Screening 
Visit (Visit 1) will be captured on the Medical  History page of the CRF/eCRF.  
If clinically significant nasal structural abnormalities  (as judged by [CONTACT_737])  including, 
but not limited to, nasal ulceration, nasal mucosal erosion, and s ignificant septal deviation are  
observed during any visit, the subject should be referred to a qualified ENT special ist or other 
medically qualified specialist (qualified to evaluate and record these conditions, as judged by [CONTACT_3786]) for further evaluation  as soon as possibl e. A record from the specialist  should be 
maintained  including the photographic evidence (imaging of nasal mucosa) of the assessment to 
allow pre- and post-treatment comparisons for AEs (see details at the beginning of Section 12.4 and Section  12.4.5). The Sponsor will collect the de-identified information as part of the study 
data collection. Eligibility of the subject for participation in the study will be at the Investigator’s 
discretion based on whether or not the protocol- defined selection criteria are met . 
A thorough eye examination will also be performed by [CONTACT_648575]. If needed, the subject should be referred to a qualified ophthalmologist for further evaluation as soon as possible.

The statistical analysis will be coordinated by [CONTACT_648576]  (or 
designee at the Contract Research Organization [CRO] ). A Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will 
be written to provide details of the analysis, along with specifications for tables, listings, and 
figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized  before the database lock. If there are 
differences, the information in the SAP will supersede the information in the protocol. Any changes from the analyses planned in the SAP will be justified in the CSR.  
All analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_1034] (or designee CRO) using SAS
® Version 9.3 or 
above. 
In general, all data will be summarized  with descriptive statis tics (number of subjects, mean, and 
standard deviation [SD] , minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency and percentage for categorical endpoints. 
13.1 Sample Size  
The sample size of 600 subjects  for this study (400 subjects on GSP 301 NS and 100 subjects in 
each of the 2 placebo groups) is based on the ICH E1 Guideline ( ICH E1)[ADDRESS_868919] 300 subjects for 6 months 
and 100 subjects for 1 year. Based on an estimat ed attrition rate of 25% after 6 months and 50% 
after [ADDRESS_868920]-baseline efficacy assessment . This will be the primary analysis set for 
efficacy analyses.  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will consist of the subset of the FAS who do not meet criteria for 
PPS exclusion. 
The Safety Analysis Set (SA S) will consist of all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study 
medication following randomization  and will be used for all safety analyses.  
The RQLQ(S) Analysis S et will consist of all English -speaking subjects ≥ 18 years old with 
impaired QOL at baseline as defined by a RQLQ(S) score at the Randomization Visit (Visit 2)  of 
3.[ADDRESS_868921]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868922] ( e.g., age, sex, race, and ethnicity) will be 
examined. Further detail s on the subgroups of interest will be specified in the SAP. 
Change from baseline in average AM rTNSS and iTNSS over the first 6, 30, and 52 weeks of 
treatment  will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for 
study treatment group, site , and baseline (defined as the average of the last [ADDRESS_868923] 4 days  of the run -in period from the Day -3 AM assessment to the 
AM assessment on  the day of randomization). At least 2 out of 4 assessments ( scores) should be 
available in order to calculate the baseline scores for the AM rTNSS and iTNSS (linear, 
continuous covariate). Least squares means (LSMs) of the treatment differences and associated 
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and p-values will be presented . A multiple, imputation -
based approach where complete data sets are drawn will be used  for handling missing data in the 
efficacy analysis. The imputation model will be defined and fully detailed in the SAP. 
Changes from baseline in rTNSS and iTNSS at the end of each week of treatment and changes 
from baseline in individual nasal symptom scores over the first 6, 30, and 52 weeks (and at the end of each treatment week) of the treatment period will be analyzed in a similar manner as 
described above.  
Changes from baseline in RQLQ(S) at Weeks 6, 30, and 52 will be analyzed for the FAS and the RQLQ(S) Analysis S et using ANCOVA models adjusting for study treatment group, site, and 
baseline RQLQ(S) (linear, continuous covariate). For subjects who withdra w early from the 
study, the RQLQ(S) score at their discontinuation visit will be used. 
The analyses of RCAT results will be similar to the RQLQ(S) analyses except the RQLQ(S) 
analysis set will not apply.  
Detailed statistical analys es and methods will be provided in the SAP.

13.7 Safety Analyses 
Unless otherwise specified, ‘baseline’ will be defined as the last available assessment prior to the 
first dose of study medication  following randomization. 
13.7.1 Extent of Exposure 
The number of subjects exposed to each study treatment will be summarized. The number of 
days on treatment and the number of days on study (run- in plus treatment periods) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_204282]. In addition, treatment compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_10611] (details will be provided in the SAP) and study treatment.  
13.7.2 Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) . Adverse events occurring between the signing of informed consent and 
administration of the first dose of randomized study medication will be regarded as pre- treatment 
AEs and included in the subject listings but not in the summary tables. Adverse events occurring after the first dose of randomized study medication will be defined as TEAEs.  
The safety endpoints related to AEs are: 
• Proportion of subjects with TEAE s.  
• Proportion of subjects with treatment -related TEAEs . 
• Incidence, type, and severity of the TE AEs after 30 weeks of study treatment . 
• Incidence, type, and severity of the TE AEs after 52 weeks of study treatment.  
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_648577], overall, and by [CONTACT_2942] (SOC) and preferred term  (PT) using frequency counts 
and percentages. The summaries  will also include the number of TEAEs experienced. A similar 
summary will be produced for subjects with treatment- related TEAE . 
The number and percentage of subjects with a TEAE that has a start date within 30 weeks of the start of treatment ( ≤182 days) will be summarized b y severity and study treatment group, overall, 
and by [CONTACT_648578]. A similar summary will be 
produced including all TEAEs during the study (i.e., after 52 weeks of treatment).   
If sufficient data exist, TEAE frequencies will be compared across treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test or a similar test.  
Additionally, the number and percentage of SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and TEAEs related to the IP will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and study treatment group. All AEs 
will be displayed in listings. AEs that occur  during the run- in period will be summarized 
separately .  
13.7.3 Laboratory Data  
The laboratory data (hematology,  biochemistry, and urinalysis), will be summarized for each 
visit at which laboratory assessments are done (Screening Visit [Visit 1], Week 30 [Visit 8], and Week 52 [Visit 12]). In addition, values outside the normal range and values deemed as 
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868925]/CT/2014/018/III

descriptive statistics. All laboratory data will be displayed in listings.  
13.7.4 Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize vital sign results and changes from ba seline by 
[CONTACT_11571] (Week 30 [Visit 8] and Week 52 [Visit 12]). Values of potential clinical significance will be defined in the SAP. The number of subjects with values of potential clinical significance will be tabulated. All vital signs data will be displayed in listings.  
13.7.5 Electrocardiograms  
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters and changes from baseline will be presented by 
[CONTACT_1570] . Shift tables will present changes from baseline to end of treatment in ECG 
interpretation ( categorized as normal; abnormal, not clinically significant; and abnormal, 
clinically s ignificant).  All ECG data will be displayed in listings.  
13.7.6 Physical Examination s 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize physical examination results by [CONTACT_11571] (Screening, Week 30 and Week 52). The number of subject s with findings of 
potential clinical significance will be tabulated. All physical examination data will be displayed in listings.  
13.7.7 Focused Ears, Nose, and Throat and Eye Examination s 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize ENT and eye examination results by [CONTACT_224825] (Week 30 and Week 52). The number of subject s with findings of potential 
clinical significance will be tabulated. All ENT and eye examination data will be displayed in 
listings. 
13.7.8 Concomitant Medication  and Withdrawals 
Any withdrawals from the study will be listed and summariz ed by [CONTACT_300336], study 
treatment group and by [CONTACT_648579]. Descrip tive statistics will be 
used to summarize the number (%) of subjects who used rescue medication along with the type, 
dose, and duration of rescue medication.

must be explained to the subject/LAR before he or she signs the ICF. Informed consent /assent 
must be obtained from the subject/LAR before any activity or treatment is undertaken which is not part of routine care. This includes, but is not limited to, the performance of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and the administration of the first dose of the study medication.  Each 
subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary, that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship with  the treating physician.  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868933]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868934]/LAR should understand the statement before signing and dating it and will be given a copy of the signed document.  
Each subject /LAR must sign an approved ICF before study participation. The form must be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_36585]. The original, signed ICF for each subject will be 
verified by [CONTACT_648581].  
The subject or the subject’s LAR should be informed in a timely manner if new information 
becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study. The communication of this information should be documented. If required, informed consent should be obtained using an amended ICF for the subject’s continuation in the study. 
15.4 Approval of the Protocol and Amendments 
Subjects will not be admitted to the study before approval of the study protocol and other 
relevant study documents by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and Regulatory Authority. 
Any change or addition to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be approved by [CONTACT_1034], Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_32397]/IEC before implementation. 
Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the 
scientific quality of the study  will require additional approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the Regulatory 
Authority, as appropriate. 
These requirements for approval will in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken 
by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_648541]. If an immediate change to the protocol is considered  necessary by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_648542], the IRB/IEC will be informed within 7 
working days. Changes affecting only administrative aspects of the study will not require formal 
protocol amendments or IRB/IEC approval, but the IRB/IEC will be kept informed of such 
administrative changes.  
Protocol changes  that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require submission 
to Health or Regulatory Authority or the IRB/IEC, but the Health or Regulatory Authority and 
IRB/IEC should be kept informed of such changes as required by [CONTACT_427]. In these 
cases, the Investigator or Sponsor, may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the

Assessment Test.  
a  Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_868950] of Clinical Laboratory Tests  
b  A focused ENT and eye ex amination will be done at all visits. Focused nasal examination s will be performed to assess signs of AR as well as known 
complications of intranasal corticosteroid or antihistamine use (i.e., bleeding, perforation, and ulceration). Throat examina tions will be conducted to evaluate 
evidence of throat irritation and candidiasis. . If at any visit, clinically significant nasal ulceration, nasal mucosal erosion, and nasal septal perforation are 
observed, or a finding at a previous visit has worsened (as judged by [CONTACT_737]), the subject should be referred to a qualified ENT specialist or other 
medically qualified specialist (qualified to evaluate and record these conditions, as judged by [CONTACT_737]) for further  evaluation. A record from the special ist 
should be maintained, including the photographic evidence (imaging of nasal mucosa) of the assessment to allow pre - and post-treatment comparisons for AEs 
(see details in Section 12.4.11). The Sponsor will collect the de -identified information as part of the study data collection. Eligibility of the subject for 
participation/continued participation in the study will be at the  Investigator’s discretion based on whether or not the protocol -defined selection criteria are met. 
These subjects may need to be re- screened due to delay in scheduling an ENT visit to obtain the necessary evaluation, as applicable, upon consultation with the 
Sponsor’s study team and approval . A thorough eye examination will also be performed by [CONTACT_648584]. If need ed, the subject should be referred to a qualified ophthalmologist for 
further evaluation as soon as possible.  
c  Documentation of a positive result within the last year ( 12 months ) before the Screening Visit (Visit 1)  is acceptable to meet the eligibility criteria. Intradermal 
and/or RAST testing will not be accepted.  
d  Generally, subjects will assess/record AR symptoms and take study medication at home. Subjects will assess their symptoms at specified clinic visits, as 
directed by [CONTACT_14523]. The subject assessment and recording of AR symptoms will be done at the clinic at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and study 
medication will be self -administered in the clinic at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the Randomization Visit (Visit 2). Morning doses of study medication 
during the run -in and treatment periods should be taken immediately following completion of the AR Assessment Diary  (as applicable) except on the morning of

(Visit 12). Subjects should be reminded not to take study medication  on the morning of the Final Visit/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 12). 
e  Subjects should be instructed to bring their study medication kit to each visit after the Screen ing Visit (Visit 1). Site personnel will collect the kit, take the used 
study medication, and return the  rest of the kit to the subject, as applicable.  
f  The RQLQ(S) must be the first procedure conducted at these visits .

21.2 Appendix 2: Subject Instructions for Proper Use of  Nasal Spray Bottle  
Subjects will administer their assigned study medication on their own (self- administration) 
using the subject instructions below. If needed, parents/guardians/caregivers can 
assist subjects with administering the study nasal spray medication (helpi[INVESTIGATOR_648549] t hat the bottle is used properly); however, they should be reminded that 
“you” as stated in the instructions below, refers to the subject and not the person assisting the 
subject.  
Preparing the Nasal Spray Bottle for Use (prior to the first use ONLY)  
As with all nasal spray medications, the  bottle must be primed prior to the first use. The priming 
process must be performed by [CONTACT_648585]. 
Priming should be done as follows: 
• Nasal spray bottle should be shaken well before priming. 
• Remove the protective (dust) cap from the bottle. 
• Hold the nasal spray bottle firmly with your index and middle finger on either side of the 
applicator (on finger rests) while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb. 
• Release [ADDRESS_868953] from the eyes and face, by [CONTACT_648586] 6 times. 
Using Nasal Spray Bottle
 
Shake the bottle well before each use (morning and even ing). 
1. Blow your nose to clear your nostrils. 
2. Remove the dust cap from the nasal spray bottle. 
3. Hold the bottle firmly with your index and middle finger on either side of the applicator 
(on finger rests) while supporting the base of the bottle with your thumb. 
4. Insert the end of the nasal tip into [ADDRESS_868954] from the nasal septum (the wall between the 2 nostrils), while holding your 
other nostril closed with [ADDRESS_868955] slightly. Keep the bottle upright, and press down the finger rests quickly and firmly to activate the pump. Breathe in (inhale) gently through your nose as you spray. Then breathe out through your mouth. Try not to get any spray in your eyes or directly on your na sal septum (the wall between the 2 nostrils).  
6. 
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_868956]/CT/2014/018/III   
Version 2.[ADDRESS_868957]
ace the protective (dust) cap on the nasal spray bottle.  
9. Avoid blowing your nose for the next 15 minutes. Do not tip your head back or blow 
your nose right after using the nasal spray. This will help to keep the medicine from 
going into your throat. 
Notes: 
• You will be given study medication kits. Remember to take your study medication 
treatment
• Prime the nasal spray bottle only 1 time (releasing 6 sprays) prior to the First Use if this 
was not done at the clinic . DO NOT prime the bottle every day. In some instances, study 
personnel may ask you to prime a new bottle at home prior to the first use. 
• If unused for more than 1 week, reprime by [CONTACT_648587] 2 times following the priming instructions.  
• This medicine is for use in the nose only. Avoid spraying in your eyes. 
• Shake well before each use (morning and evening).  
• After you finish administering the medication, wipe the tip with a clean dry tissue or 
cloth, replace the cap, and store the nasal spray bottle in an upright position in the bottle 
carton. 
• Store study medication between 15°C and 25°C (59°F and 77° F). 
• If the nasal spray bottle appears to be blocked or not spraying properly, contact [CONTACT_648588]/doctor immediately.  
• Please contact [CONTACT_648589]/coordinator or study doctor immediately if you have 
questions regarding the use of your medications.

21.4 Appendix 4: Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality -Of-Life Questionnaire with Standardized 
Activities  
General Instructions: 
1. This must be the first procedure performed at the visit. 
2. A paper version of RQLQ(S) will be provided to subjects. 3. Subjects should be placed in a quiet room to fill out the RQLQ(S). 
4. Subjects must complete the questionnaire on their own. 
5. All friends/relatives/caregivers should be asked to wait in a separate room. 6. Clinical coordinators/study site personnel should never assist the subjects in answering any 
question on the RQLQ(S). The best approach is to repeat the question exactly as it is worded in 
the questionnaire, if consulted. Under no circumstances should the question be reworded in 
an attempt to explain it to the subjects . 
 
Specific Instructions for the Clinical Coordinators/Site P ersonnel Prior to Subjects 
Completing the RQLQ(S): 
 
The clinical staff must:  
1. Tell subjects that all questions on the questionnaire (28 questions) must be answered.  2. Tell subjects that only [ADDRESS_868961] has completed the RQLQ(S), the clinical coordinator/site personnel should review the completed questionnaire to ensure that all questions have been answered.

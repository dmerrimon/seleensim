1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one-page  research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
Individuals with bronchiectasis , both due to cystic fibrosis (CF) and etiologies other than CF 
(non-CF bronchiectasis [NCFB]) , are highly susceptible to recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_14363]. A concern for individuals with bronchiectasis are 
nontuberculous mycobacteria , which are environmental bacteria that can cause chronic lung 
infections that are difficult to eradicate .  
 
The Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG) vaccine, given worldwide to infants and children to 
protect against tuberculosis (TB), has been shown to provide some protection against diseases 
other than TB by [CONTACT_14373], a phenomenon called “trained immunity” (TI).   
TI is the ability of a first infection to confer enhanced antigen -independent immunity in both 
myeloid and lymphoid cells . BCG  is a potent stimulator of TI .  Retrospective clinical trials 
have shown that BCG protects against HPV, RSV, influe nza A, and HSV1. In addition, 
prospective trials have shown inhibition of replication by [CONTACT_14374]2.  
 
Furthermore, i n numerous human studies, BCG has been shown to confer cross -protection 
against nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in healthy controls (HC ). As NTM infection rates 
are increasing in cystic fibrosis ( CF), and NTM infection leads to significant morbidity in CF , 
improved preventi ve approaches are needed .  But as far as we know, there have been no studies 
that evaluate the use of the BCG vaccine against NTM in the CF and NCFB population.  Our 
study explores  whether BCG vaccination can elicit protec tive immune responses for NTM in 
CF and NCFB .  
 
Our central hypothesis is that BCG vaccination will elicit in vitro markers  of protective 
efficacy against NTM in CF  and NCFB patients.  
 
2. Objectives  (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
• Primary objectives:  
o To evaluate BCG uptake in adults with CF and NCFB as compared to healthy 
controls .

 o To evaluate whether BCG vaccination of CF and NCFB patients compared to 
healthy controls will show comparable immune responsiveness across multiple in 
vitro parameters of NTM  protection and killing.   
o To evaluate whether CF and NCFB patients demonstrate increases in trained 
immunity comparable to healthy controls following BCG vaccination.  
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with proce dures, 
drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Prevention of infection (POI) and disease (POD) by [CONTACT_14375]. The Bacille Calmette -
Guérin (BCG) vaccine was developed in 1921 as a live attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis ( TB) by 
[CONTACT_14376]érin who serially passaged a virulent strain 
of M. bovis3. BCG is given intradermally to newborns and children in virtually all nations of the 
world except the US & Canada and certain countries in Western Europe. It is believed to be the 
single most widely utilized vaccine, with ~[ADDRESS_13635] 5 billion doses give n4. Neonatal vaccination with BCG clearly confers protection from 
disseminated TB  to children for ~5 -7 years5. Importantly, BCG is making a major comeback for 
TB. For example, a recent NEJM study in which 990 high -risk adolescents free of latent TB 
infection (LTBI) received either BCG re -vaccination or a protein subunit+adjuvant known as 
H4:IC31 found that BCG re vaccination conferred 45.4% POI, (p=0.03), which was far better than 
H4:IC316. Similarly, intrabronchial BCG in a non -human primate model, demonstrated necropsy -
proven POI (p=0.0018) while in tradermal BCG failed in POI7. A Nature paper published in January 
2020, showed that IV administration of BCG to rhesus macaques afforded complete POI against TB  
in the majority of animals8. These and other studies h ave prompted TB experts to dub BCG the 
“comeback kid” and consider repetitive BCG vaccination for fu rther TB prevention studies9. 
 
BCG protects by [CONTACT_14377] “trained immunity.” “Trained immunity” (TI) is the ability of a first 
infection to confer enhanced antigen -independent immunity in both  myeloid and lymphoid cells10. 
TI changes include increased levels of (i) pro -inflammatory cytokine secre tion, (ii) M1 polarization 
in M,, (iii) pro -inflammatory epi[INVESTIGATOR_14364], (iv) metabolomic shift towards anabolism in 
M,, and (v) autophagy. BCG is a potent stimulator of TI and has been shown to confer elevated 
responses in humans to heterologous challenges to agents such as yellow fever v irus and tumor 
challenge and vaccines2,7,11,12.  
 
Rise of NTM in CF. For unidentified reasons, rates of pulmonary NTM are increasing, both in CF 
and NCFB patients5,14,15. Some of this increase may be due to improved clinician awareness, 
increased mycobacterial surveillance practices, and changes in environmental exposure or 
pathogenicity. However, another hypothesis for observed increases in NTM rates is that decreasing 
TB incidence and waning TB immunity may increase vulnerability to NTM infection.  
 
Does BCG vaccination confer protection against NTM in humans? Recently, a prospective 
clinical trial in which [ADDRESS_13636] NTM comes from European nations with strong 
surveillance programs where BCG vaccination was suspended or terminated. In [LOCATION_009], the mean 
incidence of culture -confirmed NTM cervical lymphadenitis sharply increased from 0.57 to 3.7 per 
100,000 children per year after mandatory BCG vaccinat ion was discontinued in 200717. Similarly, 
in a large retrospective population -based study in Finland, when BCG policy changed from

 universal to selective vaccination strategy in 2006, childhood NTM infections increased drastically, 
with an incident rate ratio of 19.03x (95% CI, 8.8 -41.07; P<0.001)18. These studies support the 
hypothesis that BCG offers cross -protection against NTM disease in humans.  
 
Lower NTM rate in CF in countries with standard BCG vaccination.   We conducted an 
independent assessment of country -specific BCG vacc ination policies per the WHO  and NTM 
infection rates in [ADDRESS_13637] NTM infection in people with CF.  
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ).   
 
 Study design:  This is a prospective, single center, non -randomized open -label study.  
 
 Study population:  We plan to recruit 60 pa rticipants  with CF from the JH Adult C ystic Fibrosis   
 Center , 60 pa rticipants  with NCFB from the JH Center for NTM and Non -CF Bronchiectasis,  
and 60 healthy control  participants , gender and aged -matched to the CF arm , from the Johns 
Hopkins  Center for Immunization Research  (CIR) .  
 
 Study location: Study participants will be seen at the Johns Hopkins Center for  
Immunization Research located at [ADDRESS_13638] Rm 117 Baltimore, MD [ZIP_CODE].   
 
 Study procedures:  
 Recruitment:  
Recruitment for this study will be conducted either in person or remotely. Participants with CF 
and NCFB who are current patients of the Johns Hopkins Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center or the 
Johns Hopkins Center for Nontuberculous Mycobacteria and Bronchiectasis or other Johns 
Hopkins Pulmonary or Infectious Disease subspecialty clinics  will be evaluated for study 
participation  and approached for recruitment if eligible .  Recruitment of healthy controls will 
occur  through the Johns Hopkins Center for Immun ization Research.  Healthy controls will be 
gender and age -matched to within +/ -5 years to the CF arm.   
 
 Potential subjects will be made aware of the study by a member of their clinical team and agree  
 to be approached by [CONTACT_3476]. The study team's clinical patients and individuals who have  
 previously agreed to  be contact [CONTACT_14378].  
 Study recruitment and enrollment will take place privately via telephone or through a HIPAA  
 compliant video call system. Potential participants will be provided information about the study  
 and will review the consent form with a study team member.  
  
 Screening :   
CF and NCFB screening: HIPAA form [ADDRESS_13639] medical history .  After a 
participant has been  deemed eligible, he or she  will be contac ted by a member of the study team

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_13640] protocol  (JH200) .   
o Pre-Screening Evaluation : The purpose of the pre -screening evaluation is to determine 
subjects’ basic eligibility to participate in the screening study. This evaluation may be 
completed by [CONTACT_14379] -person. When we contact [CONTACT_14380] i nterest in participating in a research study, the pre -screening 
evaluation is performed using IRB -approved tools. Following an IRB -approved 
screening script,  the individual is provided with a general overview of the screening 
proce ss and he/she is informed of the types of trials conducted at the CIR. We then 
request the individual’s permission to administer an IRB -approved pre -screening 
questionnaire in order to determine basic eligibility.  
  
o Screening Visits: Adult subjects who are eligible for screening and express interest in 
participating in a study are scheduled for a screening visit. All potential screening 
procedures are described in the JH200 research plan but not all procedures will be 
performed on every subject. Specific screening procedures vary to minimize 
unnecessary procedures with considerations for subject safety and comfort, logistics as 
well as the current recruitment needs of the CIR . The scr eening study may require one or 
more visits of approximately 2 -4 hours. Screening procedures will be performed at 
JHSPH facilities . Screening visit (s) will include HIV testing using enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA ), rapid antibody test  and/or confirmatory test, if 
necessary .  Healthy volunteers will also be asked to sign a Medical Release Form during 
the screening visit.  In the event that an adverse event occurs during the course of the 
study, this Medical Release Form will be used to obtain relevant medical records to 
allow for appropriate adverse event tracking.  
 
o Compensation for screening visits: Individuals will be paid $80 for completion of a 
screening visit  if they are found to be eligible and enrolled in the study .  
 
 Informed Consent:   
 Investigators, research coordinators, and other study team members will be responsible for  
approaching  potential research participants  to seek informed consent .  Informed consent will 
occur either in person or remotely via DocuSign (details below). Participants will be given 
adequate time to consider the research study and ask questions  prior to signing the consent form.  
 
Healthy volunteer participants who are deemed eligible for this study during in -person screening 
visits may then complete the informed consent process immediately after the screening visit.  
 
For remote consent we intend to use  DocuSign, the Institution’s approved and 21 CFR Part 11 -
compliant software, to obtain a secure electronic signature.  Once the IRB approves our consent 
form(s), we will use the IRB -approved consent form(s) as the base for the DocuSign template. 
The IRB -approved document will not be altered other than to overlay locations where

 signatures, initials, dates or other DocuSign fields will be added to create the study -specific 
DocuSign template.   
 
We will send the consent to the participant via DocuSign, providing a participant -specific code 
in advance of sending the document via DocuSign, that will be required when the participant 
accesses and signs the consent. The consent discussion may take plac e via phone or video 
conference (e.g. Zoom).  Participants will be given adequate time to consider the research study 
and ask questions prior to signing the consent form. When ready to sign, the participant will 
enter their code, verifying that the person signing the consent is the person that we spoke with 
previously, and sign the consent within the DocuSign system.  Once the participant has 
electronically signed, the study team member obtaining informed consent will be notified that 
the electronic form is  ready for his or her signature.  Once signing is completed by [CONTACT_14381], 
both the study team and the participant can download the signed consent as a PDF.  The study 
team will also have access to the audit log and the Certificate of Completion.  The stu dy team 
will load the signed consent into Epic.  
 
After the Informed Consent process is completed, the study team member  will document the 
informed consent process and file the IRB consent document  to the research record.  
  
 Procedures prior to in -person research activities  during COVID -19: 
Individuals will be screened for change in baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_14365] -19 or recent COVID -19 exposures on both the day before (via phone) 
and the day of any in -person study activities.  If we are unable to reach a participant via phone 
for COVID screening purposes  the day before an in person study visit , the research staff  will 
administer the baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_14366].  The study visit may be canceled and rescheduled if an individua l screens 
positive.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.   
 
The BCG vaccine is given intradermally to infants  and children worldwide to protect against 
disseminated TB in most countries except the US and Canada. Its dosing for intradermal 
vaccination and safety profile is well established.   
 
We have specifically chosen the BGC vaccine to test its effects on NTM because the BCG 
vaccine has been shown to provide some protection against diseases other than TB by [CONTACT_14395].  Furthermore , based on a recent study by [CONTACT_14396]16.  
 
Due to a current global shortage of BCG VACCINE TICE®, we have received approval from 
the FDA to use TICE® BCG labeled for intravesical use in this study.  These products are 
identical in formulation, but are labeled differently to indicate different routes of administration.   
 
For this study, the selected dose of BCG TICE® is 0.1mL (~1x106 CFU), which is lower than 
the package insert dose of (0.2-0.3 mL of 2 -3 x107 CFU) .  The lower dose was chosen to be 
consistent with the BCG dose used in a recent study by [CONTACT_14397].  that showed the BCG 
(TICE® strain) induced blood -based markers of protection against NTM  in healthy controls16.  
 
In addition, we are using intradermal administration instead of  the percutaneous administration 
that is approved by [CONTACT_1622] .  Intradermal route has been chosen for two reasons: 1) in 
comparison to percutaneous administration, intradermal  administration  provides more standard 
person -to-person dosing, and 2) intradermal dosing  has been shown to provide a more robust 
immune response  compared to percutaneous administration24. 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA 
approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  populations are 
changed.    
 
TICE® BCG for intravesical use is licensed by [CONTACT_14398] (CIS) of the urinary bladder, and for the 
prophylaxis of primary or recurrent stage Ta and/or T1 papi[INVESTIGATOR_219]22.   
 
BCG VACCINE  TICE® for percutaneous use is licensed by [CONTACT_14399] U.S. for the 
prevention of tuberculosis in persons not previously infected with M. tuberculosis  who are at 
high risk for exposure. T he Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the 
Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis  recommends the BCG intradermal 
vaccine for the  following circumstances23:

 1. Infants and children with negative tuberculin skin tests who are (a) at high risk of 
intimate and prolonged exposure to persistently untreated or ineffectively treated 
patients with infectious pulmonary TB (b) continuously exposed to persons with 
infectiou s pulmonary tuberculosis who have bacilli resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, 
and the child cannot be separated from the presence of the infectious patient.  
2. TB exposed health care workers in high risk settings where (a) a high percentage of TB 
patients are infected with M. tuberculosis  strains that are resistant to both isoniazid and 
rifampin, (b) transmission of such drug resistant M. tuberculosis  strains to health care 
workers and subsequent infection is likely (c) comprehensive TB infection control 
precautions have been implemented, but have not been successful.  
 
Our study does not include any of these indications.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
whether BCG vaccine can be effective in protection against NTM infections in patients with CF 
and NCFB.  We have received an IND exemption from the FDA for the use of BCG in this 
study ( See supplemental study documents ).   
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.  
 
See above. We have received an IND exemption from the FDA for the use of BCG in this study 
(see Supplemental study documents ).  
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.  
• BCG Ag -specific cytokine release  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables.  
• NTM cross protectivity  
• Development of lung infections among the CF/NCFB arms during the 6-month  period  
• Markers of trained immunity  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis.  
 
Sample Size Calculations : The primary hypothesis tests are based upon en rollment of 60 
individuals with in each study arm while assuming a conservative attrition and dropout rate of 10% 
in each study group.  Due to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_14372], participants that drop out of the study 
will not be replaced.  Power calculations were based upon testing a mean difference in slopes 
between groups assuming a within -person correlation of observations of 0.[ADDRESS_13646] assumed that 
baseline response will not differ  between groups; preliminary data for standard deviation of markers 
was obtained from  Abate et al. We will have 80% power to detect changes in the mean difference in 
slopes ranging from approximately 11% (TNF ) to 65% (IL17) for markers of BCG -stimulated 
immune response, NTM -induced cytokine, and NTM killing activity between the CF and control 
groups and between NCFB and control groups at each time point at a significance level of 0.05.  
Given the heterogenous responses in individuals, we consider a mean di fference in slopes of 40%, 
indicative of an immune response deficiency, between groups to be a clinically meaningful 
difference.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_13647] 80% power to detect mean differences ranging from 
approximately 10 -70% of TI at each time point between groups at a significance level of 0.05 
assuming the same conditions as above , with the exception that the time variable will be the 
pre/post -stimulus condition. We will repeat these  analyses for each time point.  We have based 
power calculations using Cohen’s f2 (multiple correlation/1 - multiple correlation) due to the lack of 
available data in these populatio ns to estimate mean differences.  
 
Statistical Plan : Demographic and clinical characteristics of each study group will be described. 
Descriptive statistics, including proportions means and standard deviations and medians and 
interquartile  ranges will be used to summarize BCG -stimulated immune response and NTM -
induced cytokine and NTM killing  activity at each time point (0, 30 days  and 90 days ) for each 
study group.   Log-transformations of markers will be performed if distributional assumptions 
indicate. The primary statistical procedures wil l utilize linear mixed models to evaluate the mean 
difference  in each marker from time 0 to 30 days  and from time 0 to 90 days.  The model takes the 
following form: E[Y ij] = b 0 + b 1 time j + b 2 group i + b 3 group * time  + a'z i + i where Y ij is the 
marker of interest for subject i at time j, group denotes the CF/NCFB/control status, time is a 
numeric visit number, z i can include a vector of potential confounders and  is a subject -specific 
random effect to account for within -person correlations of the outcome while assuming the 
outcomes follow a Gaussian distribution. The parameter b [ADDRESS_13648] of CF/NCFB status on changing markers from baseline.  Importantly, this 
model specifically allows u s to account for baseline differences between groups, if they do exist.  
Secondary analyses will leverage the full longitudinal data collection of each of the three time 
points utilizing the previously described methods.   
 
Interim Analysis : An interim  safety assessment  will be conducted once [ADDRESS_13649] completed the intradermal BCG vaccination and the  
30-day blood draw.   
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
 
If there are two or more of the same Grade 3  adverse events (severe or medically significant but 
not immediately life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; 
disabling; limiting self-care or ADLs), or a single Grade 4 adverse events  (life threatening 
consequences; urgent intervention indicated), the study will be halted until the Data Safety  
Monitoring Board (DSMB ) can meet to discuss  the appropriate action s that should be taken.    
 
8.  Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 
Following BCG vaccination, it is expected that nearly all individuals will exhibit a positive 
tuberculin skin test (also referred to as a purified protein derivative test or [COMPANY_003]) for a period of 
approximately five to seven years.  Thus, latent TB testing via [COMPANY_003] method may be confounded 
by [CONTACT_14400].  Howev er, latent TB status can still be accurately determined by 
[CONTACT_14401] (ex: QuantiFERON -TB Gold and ELISPOT TB).   
 
Common adverse events from intradermal BCG vaccination include  pain at injection site,  a 
local skin reaction at the site of vaccination , which may ulcerate  and scar , cause regional 
suppurative lymphadenitis, and o steitis, a rare complication (approx.  complication rate

 0.39/1,000,000).  The most serious complication of BCG vaccination is disseminated BCG 
infection. The most frequent disseminated infection is BCG osteomyelitis (0.01 to 43 cases per 
1,000,000 doses). Fatal disseminated BCG infection has occurred at a rate of 0.06 -1.56 
cases /1,000,[ADDRESS_13650] cancer.   
 
Common adverse events from routine blood draws include mild pain at blood draw site, minor 
bleeding and/or bruising.   
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks .  
 
Experienced nursing and research staff from the JH CIR will perform the intradermal 
vaccinations and study blood draws.  
 
To minimize concerns, w e are excluding  individuals with  immunosuppres sion, children, elderly, 
and pregnant/breastfeeding participants.   
 
To minimize confounding results on mammography, f emale participants will be advised to 
delay screening mammography performed for a minimum of 3 months following BCG 
vaccination.   
 
We will adhere to guidance on DSMB activities  (see attachment) .  The data and safety 
monitoring plan will include reporting any adverse events to the IRB and the DSMB in the 
quarterly progress reports.  In addition, we have a detailed plan on how to deal with serious 
adverse events that may arise, which will include reporting to the chair of the DSMB and IRB 
within 24 -hours of notification. The study will be conducted according to the FDA’s Good 
Clinical Practice Guidelines.   
 
A DSMB has been created to function as an independent group of experts who will advise the 
study investigators.  The members of the DSMB will serve in an individual capacity and provide 
their expertise and recommendations. The members are not co -investigat ors of the study and 
have no undisclosed conflict of interest.    
 
 
Safety Monitoring Plan:  
Following BCG administration, participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_14402] 101.5 °F or greater, or acute localized 
inflammation persisting longer than 2 -3 days, which would be suggestive of active infections. If 
an illness of this degree has occurred, an evaluation for a serious infectious complication will be 
performed which includes co nsultation with an infectious disease physician.  In individuals who 
develop persistent fever or exper ience an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection,

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_13651] info rmation to register 
complaints, if they experience adverse events, coercion or other problems. Participant 
complaints will be reported to the IRB  pursuant to Hopkins policies .  The DSMB will modify or 
stop the study if any such complaints represent a legitimate concern about the study procedures 
or methods.  
 
The DSMB has the authority to halt the study if it perceives that harm is occurring due to the 
intervention.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipat ed problems or study deviations:  
 
All unanticipated problems or study deviations will be reported per standard Johns Hopkins IRB  
procedures .  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.   
 
The data are being recorded on an encrypted laptop and SAFE Desktop . All files will be 
password protected . Only specified study team members will have access to the data. The data 
set will not include any sensitive information. All blood samples will be deidentified and will 
not be traceable back to participant.

9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
 
• Individual benefits: The individual may experience positive emotions from contributing to 
the development of patient -centered interventions by [CONTACT_14403].   
They may also benefit from the protective nature of the BCG vaccine.  
• Societal benefits: This study will provide formative information regarding the efficacy of the 
BCG vaccine to provide immunity towards NTM infections.  These data will inform future 
larger studies designed to study regarding the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against NTM 
infect ions in the CF and NCFB populations.    
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
• Healthy controls will be compensated $80 for completion of the screening visit  if they 
are found to be eligible and enrolled in the study .  
• Study p articipants from all arms will receive $200 for the initial visit where they will 
undergo a blood draw and be administered the BCG vaccine. Participants will then 
receive $80 for each subsequent study blood draw.  Total compensation for participation 
in this study will be $360 (excluding compensation for screening of healthy controls).

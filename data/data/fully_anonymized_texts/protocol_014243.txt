INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND  
Cesarean delivery (CD)  is the operative mode of the delivery, which includes 
laparotomy (skin incision) and hysterotomy  (uterine incision) in order to facilitate the 
delivery of the newborn. In the modern obstetric practice in the [LOCATION_002] one in  
three women  who gave birth did so by [CONTACT_398]. (1). Cesarean birth can be life -saving for the 
fetus, the mother,  or both in certain cases. The rate of primary CD has increased and 
more women prefer elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) (2).This  increased rate 
of cesarean deliveries is associated with the short - and long -term maternal 
complications (3) such as  RBC transfusion (2) . Among approaches used to re duce the 
rate of the postoperative complications are prophylactic administration of antibiotics (4) 
and improvement of surgical techniques (5). In particular, the improvement of surgical 
technique could contribute to more than two -fold decrease in post -operative morbidity 
(5).The appli cation of techniques of the abdominal  incision during CD is associated with 
hysterotomy approaches and subsequently maternal  morbidity in specific patient  
population s (6). 
 
During surgical procedures, o ne of the widely used approaches to decrease blood loss, 
surgery time and thus  post-operative complications is tissue dissection by 
[CONTACT_354160], which is defined as the process of applying high -frequency electric 
current to the tissues to cut, coagulate, and desiccate (7). After the introduction of 
electrosurgery into the practice of surgery in [ADDRESS_441120]. Harvey W 
Cushing (8), it has since become a  powerful  tool in different surgical subspecialties 
(9)(7).

 Electrosurgical instruments are widely used for tissue dissections and to control 
bleeding, as an  easy and safe surgical approach, but their use in making skin incisions 
is limited. The major  purported  disadvantages of electrosurgical skin incision s are fears 
of deep  burns; with resultant scaring (10),  slower wound healing , and increased 
postoperative pain . However, recent  meta -analyses showed decreased incision time,  
blood loss and post -operative pain with no significant difference in wound infection rates 
or scar (13)(14). 
With improve d techniques of electrosurgery , several randomized trials - the gold  
standard of clinical research , were  performed. A  randomized double blind study (15) 
performed in [ADDRESS_441121] been reported using advanced 
diathermy technolo gy by [CONTACT_43265] (16).  The mechanism of  these positive effects of 
cutting electrosurgey  is that the skin  is  cut  with an electro de  delivering  pure  
sinusoidal  current,  which allows tissue cleavage by [CONTACT_354161]; this may explain the absence of tissue charring  and the 
subsequent healing with minimal scarring (17). 
 
Taking together, the recently published advantages of diathermy in the skin incision  
could be  extremely useful in preventing  complications and  decreasing maternal 
morbidity associated  with CD.   However, there are no clinical trials  comparing scalpel  
and diathermy in the population of pregnant patients  undergoing CD . To perform such 
trials will have direct translational value.  In situations of  emergency cesarean sections , 
as an  example, it will provide important information  on which  method will be fastest with 
the least  amount  of blood loss . 
 
OBJECTIVE  
The objective o f this study is to compare scalpel  vs. diathermy in abdominal  wall 
incision , in pregnant patients undergoing repeat elective cesarean  delivery.

METH ODS  
1) This is a randomized prospective study in women undergoing elective repeat 
cesarean delivery or repeat unplanned non -emergent cesarean delivery at 
Medical Center Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354156].  
2) After informed consent is obtained, w omen undergoing cesarean delivery will be 
randomized  into two groups:  
Group One  
Will undergo diathermy to incise the entire abdominal wall,  which includes skin, 
subcutaneous tissue, rectus muscle until the peritoneal  cavity is visible .  
Group Two  
Scalpel will be  used to achieve the same aim s 
  
3)  Only patients undergoing elective repeat cesarean delivery will be enrolled , this 
will decrease the likelihood of introducing bias into the outcome measures, as 
well as it will make  the population more uniform.  
4) A standardized  abdominal wall  incision will be made with either diathermy in cut 
mode or scalpel. Diathermy will be set in a cut mode with standard setting as per 
surgeon ’s preference. All patients in the study will get standard skin incision in 
terms of length and depth  which will be marked by a ruler . 
5)  Incision start and stop time will be recorded by a “timer”.  A digital wall clock in 
the OR will be used to establish time. The timer w ill instruct the surgeon to “cut” . 
The timer will record the time. Once the surgeon reaches the abdominal 
peritoneum, they will announce “stop”. The timers will record the time. The 
incision time will be the difference between the “cut” and “stop” times. T hese 
times will be recorded in units of seconds.

 6) Along the incision depth the bleeding points will be mopped with sponge laps, no 
suction will be used and total blood loss will be calculated by [CONTACT_354162].  
 
7) Blood loss will be recorded as follows: A  “used” lap sponge will weighed. A 
“fresh” lap sponge will be weighed. These weights will be recorded. Blood loss 
will be calculated as the differences in these two weights. These weights will be 
recorded in grams.  
 
8) As per standard of care s pi[INVESTIGATOR_354157] (CRNA) . Post-operative  pain will be 
managed as follows: 1) 300 micrograms of Morphine sulfate will be injected 
through then spi[INVESTIGATOR_354158]. 2) 
30 milligrams of Toradol will be injected IM, in the left thigh, at the conclusion of 
the case.  3) 10 mg hydrocodone/325mg acetaminophen 1 -2 tablets, per oral, 
every 4 -6 hours, PRN pain.  
9) Post-operative  pain will be measured by a Numeric Pain Rating Scale  (see 
below) scored as 0= no pain, up to 10= worst possible pain . This score will be 
assessed daily by [CONTACT_354163] 6:00 to 7:[ADDRESS_441123] –op day 1  until 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
10) As per standard MCH protocol, within one hour preoperatively, Ancef 2 -3gms will 
be administered IV. If the patient is Penicillin allergic, she will receive eithe r 900 
milligrams of Clindamycin or 1gram of Vancomycin .

SELECTION OF PATIENTS   
 
Inclusion Criteria -  
1. Multiparous pregnant women 18 – 45 years.   
2. Gestational ages 37 weeks to 41 weeks,  
3. Undergoing repeat elective or repeat unplanned non -emergent cesarean 
deliveries.  
 
Women with medical comorbidities like hypertension, diabet es complicating 
pregnancy, pregnant women with or without prenatal care, and multiple 
gestations will also be included.  
 
Exclusion Criteria –  
1. Informed consent can’t be obtained in a manner that allows for no impression 
of undue influence/pressure or suff icient time for patient to consider 
participation.  
2. Primary Cesarean deliveries – as these can bias the selection.  
3. Skin conditions such as infections, psoriasis, and eczema.  
 
RECRUITMENT PLAN  
Patients from University Women`s Health Centre ([LOCATION_007] Tech OBGYN clinic) and also 
from Medical Center Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Odessa, [LOCATION_007] will be recruited. Potential participants will 
be identified by a member of the study team or clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354159]. In the latter case, study personnel will be c ontacted to meet the patient after the 
patient has expressed an interest in learning more about participation.   All the 
participants will have  the study procedures, risks, benefits and alternatives explained by 
a member of the study team.    
 
Once informed consent is obtained they will be randomized with 1:1 allocation by a 
computer generated randomization process . Since the annual rate of cesarean

Protocol vers ion: 1.[ADDRESS_441124] to enroll a total 
of 100 patients, and w e will allocate 50 patients to each group. Assuming a significance 
level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, and observing that there is a single measurement and 
null attrition rate, we will be able to detect at least moderate effect sizes ( d=0.50) when 
performing  independent means comparisons.  
 
RISKS : 
Diathermy – 
A. Possibility of poor wound healing,  
B. There are concerns that large or excessive scars may form,   
C. Unanticipated burns on skin, subcutaneous tissues and other vital organs.  
 
Scalpel –  
A. Injury to the major blood vessels.  
B. Injury to the vital organs.  
C. Excessive bleeding  
 
From the review of recent literature there are some concerns raised regarding the use 
of diathermy for skin incisions (10, 11, 12). However, we believe that the use of cutt ing 
diathermy, as described in our protocol, does not increase patient risk within the study 
group.   First, there is a concern that diathermy,  while making skin incisions, may 
increase the risk of wound complications, as well as delayed wound healing. However 
these studies differ from  ours in a number of ways : A) Most studies claiming increase in 
risk examine midline abdominal incisions, and our  study employs Pfannenstie l skin 
incision. B) In some studies it is unclear if pure cut mode was employed . The use of a 
blend mode will cause more lateral spread  of current. This may increase the amount of 
tissue damage, thus promoting wound complications.  Our study will employ diathermy 
only in  pure cut mode in a standard setting as per surgeon ’s preference.   A recent 
Cochrane review, which includes only randomized trials (the highest form of scientific 
inquiry) , found no significant difference in wound co mplications between scalpel and 
diathermy  (18).

Second, there has been a case report of a severe burn injury on patients back while 
utilizing diathermy during cesarean delivery (19). The purported mechanism for this 
burn was an interaction between diathermy and amniotic fluid (19). However in our 
study,  cutting diathermy will be used only in incision of skin, subcutaneous fat and 
rectus fascia. This use precludes any interaction between diathermy and amniotic fluid.  
 
ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING : 
Any event deemed as an Adverse Event that is possibly related or unexpected to the 
study will be assessed at each data gathering point and will be reported to the TTUHSC 
IRB as described in the IRB policies and procedure manual.   Monitoring of adverse 
events will start on the day of surgery.  
 
BENEFITS  – There are no guarantees of any benefit to study participants. However, 
participants may have potential benefits of using electrosurgery which include reducing 
the amount of blood loss, dry and rapid separation of tissues. For surgeons, there is a 
reduce d risk of accidental cut injuries.  
 
DATA ANALYSIS :  
Distributions of operative time, blood loss  and post-operative pain will be tested for  
normal  distribution . Student ’s T test or the non -parametric equivalent will be used to 
compare these outcomes between  the study and control group.  Significance level will 
be set at 0.05.  
 
 
DATA MONITORING PLAN:  
All data for each participant will undergo quality assurance monitoring by [CONTACT_354164] a member of the study team.  The purposes of this monitoring ar e to verify that:  
(a)  The rights and well -being of human subjects are protected.  
(b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents.

RESULTS  
Expected results will be the finding of less operative time, blood loss, posto perative 
pain, in diathermy abdominal wall incisions compared to scalpel  incisions , in pregnant 
women undergoing repeat cesarean deliveries.  
 
CONCLUSION  
To our knowledge, this study will be the first to compare the resu lts of diathermy vs 
scalpel abdominal wall incisions in pregnant women undergoing cesarean deliveries .  
The study results can be used to hel p determine which method of incision is preferably 
used especially in case of emergency cesarean deliveries where time is a crucial factor.

1 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
The proposed study is a follow -up study to LCCC 1120.  In LCCC 1120, patients with 
HPV positive and/or p16 positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
(OPSCC) received de -intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by a limited 
surgical evaluation.  The primary endpoint of LCCC 1120 was  the rate of pathological 
complete response ( pCR) after CRT.  Power computations were performed for N=40 and 
were based on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR for de -intensified 
chemoradiotherapy is at least 87% , the historical rate.   The type 1 error for this 
calculation was 14.2%.    43 patients enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary 
endpoint.  The observed pCR rate was 89% (34/38).  Since the observed pCR rate was 
excellent in LCCC [ADDRESS_522450] -CRT surgical evaluation .  Instead a PET/CT  [ADDRESS_522451] -CRT will be used to determine whether a surgical evaluation is needed. This 
study will be multi -institutional , with patients also enrolling at the University of [LOCATION_012], 
Gainesville, [LOCATION_012] ; Rex Cancer Center of Raleigh, R aleigh, North Carolina; High Point 
Regional Hea lth, High Point, North Carolina; and Pardee Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
Hendersonville, North Carolina.  
1.[ADDRESS_522452] treatment regimen for HPV -associated oropharyngeal or unknown primary 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is 70 Gy, 2 Gy per day, 35 fractions, over 
7 weeks with 2 to 3 doses of cisplatin 100mg/m2.  Most institutions  perform  a PET/CT at 
[ADDRESS_522453] a biopsy of the primary site and/or a neck dissection after 
treatment. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_414394] a negative PET/CT scan are observed (i.e. no surgery).   
Standard CRT is associated with significant acute toxicit y with most patients 
experiencing grade 3 and 4 acute toxicity during treatment.  Furthermore, approximately 
20% of patients wi ll have Gr ade [ADDRESS_522454] suggested that HPV -positive tumors

Version/Date :  10/24/[ADDRESS_522455] HNSCC is 70 Gy 
with 3 cycles of concurrent cisplatin at 100mg/m231. Less intensive chemotherapy and/or 
radiation may be just as effective in HPV -related oropharyngeal HNSCC and reduce the 
severity of acute toxicity and long -term morbidity associated with CRT.  We recently 
completed a phase II study evaluating de -intensified CRT which showed promising  
results.  The proposed study will further study the efficacy of de -intensificat ion.  
1.[ADDRESS_522456] been verified in analyses of prospective clinical trials10,13,18.  
Fakhry et al. evaluated the HPV status of 96 patients with laryngeal or oropharyngeal 
SCC from an Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase II trial.  Patients with 
HPV positive tumors had higher response rates after induction chemotherapy (82% vs. 
55%, p = 0.01) and CRT  (84% vs. 57%, p = 0.007) as compared to those with HPV -
negative tumors.  The 2 year overall survival was also improved  - 95% (HPV positive) 
vs. 62% (HPV negative). Lassen et al. analyzed the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group 
(DAHANCA) 5 trial and observed an improved local -regional control, disease specific 
survival, and overall survival  in patients whose tumors were p16 positive (a surrogate 
marker for HPV) versus those who were p16 negative18.   
 
The RTOG [ADDRESS_522457] fractionation, both 
with concurrent cisplatin (2 cycles in the former and 3 cycles in the latter).  There was no 
statistical difference in overall or progression free survival betw een the two arms.  Post -
hoc analysis of HPV status and outcomes in the OPSCC subset showed a significant 
improvement in OS (82.4%, vs. 57.1% at 3 year; P<0.001) and PFS in the HPV positive 
tumors. After accounting for other prognostic factors, HPV positivi ty conferred a 58% 
reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66).   Locoregional 
control was improved in the HPV -positive tumors; however, distant metastatic control 
and the rate of second malignancies were similar for both HPV -positive and negative 
OPSCC subgroups. Through recursive portioning analysis this OPSCC cohort was 
stratified into low, intermediate, and high risk groups for death (3 year OS of 93%, 
70.8%, and 46.2% respectively).  The factors used for stratification, in  order of 
importance, were:  HPV status, pack -years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal 
stage.  To be categorized as having low risk of death, a patient must have a HPV -positive 
tumor and either have ≤ 10 pack years of tobacco smoking and any N stag e or > 10 pack 
years of tobacco smoking and N0 -N2a nodal stage.   
 
O’Sullivan et al. conducted a large retrospective study of 899 OPSCCs patients treated at 
the Princ ess Margaret Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414395], Canada32.  HPV status was ascertained in 505 
(56%):  382 HPV positive and 123 HPV negative.  All patients were treated with 
radiation alone or CRT from 2001 to 2009, with a median follow -up of 3.9 years.  
Recursive portioning analysis segregated HPV -positive patients into low (T1 -3 N0 -N2c) 
and high (T4 or N3) distant metastasis risk:  93% vs. 76% respectively.  Furthermore ,

3 smoking > [ADDRESS_522458] recurrence free 
survival (local, regional, and distant recurrences) in HPV -positive patients.  This suggests 
that other associated tobacco -related disease may be the reason for decreased survival in 
HPV -positive smokers vs. HPV -positive non -smokers.  Also, the recurrence free survival 
was excellent ( >90%) in low -risk HPV -positive patients  with T1 -2, N0 -[ADDRESS_522459] been dismal, with 
median 5 year OS for all comers being approximately 50%.  Because of the poor 
outcomes of HNSC C, the treatment paradigm has been to intensify therapy.  HPV -
positive OPSCC may be a unique clinical/biological entity that is associated with a 
significantly better prognosis because of a potentially increased sensitivity to CRT and 
thus amenable to de -escalation of therapy.  
 
Several co -operative groups are conducting trials evaluating the reduction of RT dose 
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group currently is 
conducting a phase II trial studying reduction of RT dose after neoadjuvant chemother apy 
in HPV positive OPSCC33.  Dana -Farber Cancer Institute is also evaluating a 
modification of the RT dose after neoadjuvant chemotherapy34.  By [CONTACT_414410] -escalate the radiation dose 
depending on the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  This regimen of treatment is 
not pure de -intensification because one modality (i.e. chemotherapy) is being intensified 
so that another (i.e. radiation) can be de -intensifie d.  The overall treatment time is 
lengthened, thus prolonging the duration of acute toxicities.  Furthermore, as a whole, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not improve outcomes in HNSCC35.  A meta -analysis 
has shown that the most effective combination of chemotherapy with RT is concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy35.  Another de -escalation strategy may be to reduce the intensity of 
chemotherapy.  Retrospective data from Princess Margaret Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414396] -positive OPSCC treated with RT alone may be equivalent to CRT36.  
Our study will evaluate de -intensification of CRT by [CONTACT_414411], which will result in shortening treatment 
time by 1 week . 
1.6 LCCC 1120: Phase II Study of De-intensification of Radiation and Chemotherapy 
for Low -Risk HPV -related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma   
We conducted a phase II study evaluating the efficacy of de -intensified radiotherapy in a 
favorable subgroup of patients with OPSCC.  Eligible patients had HPV -positive and/or 
p16-positive OPSCC, T0 – T3, N0 – N2c, M0, and < 10 pack years of smoking. Patients 
received 60 Gy of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent weekly 
intravenous cisplatin (30 mg/m2).  Diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI) was obtained 4 
to 8 weeks after completion of CRT to assess response.  All patients had surgical 
resection of any clinically apparent residual primary tumor or biopsy of the primary site if 
there was no evidence of residual tumor and underwent  a neck dissection to encompass at 
LCCC 1413   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_414393], MD   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
Version/Date :  10/24/[ADDRESS_522460] those nodal level(s) that were positive pre -treatment, within 4 to 14 weeks after 
CRT.  The primary endpoint of LCCC 1120 was  the rate of pCR.  Longitudinal 
assessments of quality of life and patient reported outcomes were also obtained prior to, 
during, and after CRT.   Power computations were performed for N=40 and were based 
on the null hypothesis (H0) that the pCR for de -intensified chemoradiotherapy is at least 
87%, the historical rate.  The type 1 error for this calculation was 14.2%.  43 patien ts 
enrolled and 38 were evaluable for the primary endpoint.  The observed pCR rate was 
89% (34/38), which is excellent and within the expected result for a positive outcome .    
1.7 Rationale  
Because of the positive results of our initial de -intensification study, we are proposing 
conducting a similar study with 5 major modifications:  
 
1.   Not require surgical evaluation after de -intensified CRT :  
Biopsy or s urgery of the primary site adds morbidity without value. This assessment is no 
longer standard practice at most institutions and is not necessary in this setting based on 
the results of our initial study.  
 
Dissecting the neck adds significant morbidity. Standard practice today is to base the 
need for neck dissection on the results of [ADDRESS_522461] CRT neck dissection only in cases where the ~[ADDRESS_522462] favorable subgroups:  
There are now multiple studies demonstrating very high cure rates with RT alone in 
patients with stage T1 -2, N0 -[ADDRESS_522463] that 60 
Gy RT alone will be adequate for favorable prognosis cases in our study population. For 
this reason the current study dictates  RT alone in: p16/HPV positive, T 0-2, N0 -1, ≤ 10 
pack years . 
 
3.   Expand the study to patients with smoking history of ≤ 30 pack -years  with ≥5 years 
of abstinence from smoking : 
Tobacco use is a factor of secondary importance following stage and p16/HPV status. 
The O’Sullivan data suggests that moderate tobacco use did not affect cancer control 
rates in HPV -positive patients32.   In view of the excellent results in our initial study it is 
logical to expand the inclusion criteria of the current study to patients with a moderate 
smoking history.  
 
4.  Chemotherapy :  In our prior study, weekly cisplatin was the mandated chemotherapy 
regimen. However we were not able to offer our prior study to several patients with low -
risk OPSCC because of co -morbidities that precluded the use of cisplatin. There are many 
LCCC 1413   CONFIDENTIAL

Version/Date :  10/24/[ADDRESS_522464] choice option.  
 
5.  Changing the Primary Objective :  In our prior study the primary objective was pCR – 
since surgery was part of the treatment algorithm.  For the proposed study, the primary 
objective will be the more standard 2 year PFS.  
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate 2 year PFS  after de -intensified  CRT in HPV -positive and/or p16 positive 
favorable -risk OPSCC.  
2.2 Secondary Objective s 
2.2.1 To assess the 2 year clinical outcomes of local control (LC), regional control (RC), local -
regional control (LRC), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and overall survival 
(OS) . 
3.0 ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary Endpoint  
Patients with HPV -positive and/or p16 -positive favorable -risk OPSCC will receive de -
intensified CRT.  The 2 year PFS will be evaluated.  Our null hypothesis (H 0) is that the 
PFS rate is 87% and our alternate hypothesis (H 1) is that the PFS rate is 80%.  
3.2 Secondary Endpoint s 
3.2.1 Clinical Outcomes:   Kaplan Mei er estimates of LC, RC, LRC , DMFS , and OS will be 
calculated .

5.4 Radiation Therapy   
All patients will receive Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatments (IMRT).   
Tomotherapy is allowed.  
5.4.1 CT simulation:   CT simulation will be obtained with IV contrast for treatment planning 
purposes for all patients.  The head and neck area will be immobilized with an aquaplast 
mask.  Patients will be positioned in the neck extended position.  
5.4.2 Target and Organ at Risk Volumes:   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) :  is defined as all known gross disease determined  
on the CT simulation scan .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  High Risk Clinical Target Volumes (CTV -HR):  is defined as the GTV plus a  
non-uniformly expanded 5 to 10 mm to account for high risk areas of 
microscopic spread .  For situations where the primary tumor was removed with 
the biopsy (e.g. tonsillectomy) and the primary tumor cannot be seen on 
radiographic imaging the biopsy site will be included in the CTV -HR.  For 
patients with an unknown primary (T0) the ipsilateral oropharynx (base of 
tongue, tonsil, soft palate) will be included in the CTV -HR volume.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Standard Risk Clinical Target Volume (CTV -SR):  is defined as the elective 
nodal regions.  The consensus guidelines  for the node negative and node 
positive necks published by [CONTACT_414413]. will be used as a guide to define the 
CTV -SR38,39. For the situation of the unk nown primary (i.e. T0), the 
nasopharynx will be included in the CTV -SR.  The following guidelines will be 
used in delineating the CTV -SR. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1   Node positive hemi -neck (ipsilateral or contralateral to the primary site)38:  
The following elective nodal regions should be included in the CTV -SR:  
Levels Ib -V and retropharyngeal. The cranial extent to the base of skull of 
Level II and retropharyngeal nodes should be electively irradiated.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2   Ipsilateral node negative hemi -neck39:  The following elective nodal regions  
should be included in the CTV -SR:  Levels II –IV and retrophar yngeal  area.   
The cranial extent to the base of skull of Level II and retropharyngeal nodes 
should be electively irradiated.    
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Contralateral node negative hemi -neck39:  The contralateral parotid may be 
spared by [CONTACT_414414], defined as the Level II, retropharyngeal region above

irradiation may be completely omitted for well lateralized tonsil cancers, 
defined as having no invasion of the base of tongue, and minimal invasion of 
the soft palate (i.e. > 1 cm from the uvula)40. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Unknown Primary:   The above elective nodal irradiation guidelines will be 
used.  Furthermore the nasopharynx will be included in the CTV -SR. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planning Target Volumes (PTV) :  To account for daily setup errors, the CTV -
HR will be expanded uniformly by 3 mm to create a High Risk Planning Target 
Volume (PTV -HR).  The CTV -SR will be expan ded uniformly  by [ADDRESS_522470] Risk Planning Target Volume (PTV -SR). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Organs at Risk (OAR) :  The following normal tissues will be segmented on CT 
simulation scan:  spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem, parotids, cochleae , and larynx.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planning Risk Volumes (PRV) :  OAR(s)  will be uniformly expanded 3mm to 
create individual Planning Risk Volumes (PRV).   
5.4.3 Dose Specification :  Dose painting IMRT will be used and a ll doses will be specified to 
the PTV.  The PTV -HR and PTV -SR will be treated to the following respective total 
doses:  60 Gy and 54 Gy.  The dose per fraction to the PTV -HR and PTV -SR will be 2 
Gy per day  and 1.8 Gy per day respectively .  Thus the total number of fractions will be 
30. All fields will be treated once a day Monday through Friday.  
5.4.4 IMRT Treatment Planning:  PTV’s and PRV will be included in the IM RT 
optimization. Seven to nine equidistant fields will be placed around the PTV.  None of 
the beams will directl y oppose one another .  Dose objectives will be chosen for the IMRT 
optimization based on previous institutional experience.  Dose painting  (i.e. simultaneous 
integrated boost)  will be used to create one IMRT plan . The PTV -SR contours will 
encompass the PTV -HR contours.  The dose to the PTV -SR plan will be [ADDRESS_522471] radiation dose in both study arms of 
the currently ongoing RTOG 1016 (Phase III trial of Radiotherapy plus Ce tuximab versus 
Chemoradiotherapy in HPV -asssociated Oropharynx Cancer).  In the proposed study we 
will be giving 60 Gy at 2 Gy per daily fraction to the gross tumor and 54 Gy at 1.8 Gy per 
daily fraction to areas at risk for harboring subclinical microscop ic disease.  Thus the 
proposed dose in our study is actually lower than historical standards and the current 
RTOG study.

▪ PTV -HR and PTV -SR  
o 100% of the prescription should cover 95% of the PTV  
o No more than 20% of the PTV should receive ≥ 110% of the prescribed dose  
o No more than 1% of the PTV should receive ≤ 93% of the prescribed dose  
▪ Non-target Tissue  
o No more than 1% of the tissue outside the PTV should receive ≥ 110% of the 
prescribed dose  
▪ PRV  
o Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]:  0.1cc  50 Gy  
o Brainstem: 0.1cc  54 Gy  
o Parotid:  Mean dose < 26 Gy and/or 50% < 30 Gy  
o Cochlea:  Mean dose < 45 Gy 
o Larynx:  Mean dose < 41 Gy and/or 60 Gy to < 20%  
 
PTV coverage should not be compromised to meet the dose constraints  of the parotid, 
cochlea, or larynx.  Sparing of these structures is left at the discretion  of the treating 
radiation oncologists .  The dose constraints  for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_414397].  This may be done at the cost of altering the PTV.   
5.4.6 Treatment Verification :  Weekly orthogonal films or cone beam CT’s should be 
performed to verify patient setup  (at least) . 
5.4.7 Radiation Treatment Breaks:  Ideally, treatment breaks, if necessary, should not exceed 
5 treatment days at a time and 10 treatment days total. Treatment breaks should be 
allowed only for resolution of severe acute toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness and not 
for social or logisti cal reasons.  
5.5 Chemotherapy :  In our initial  study, LCCC 1120, all patients were started on a regimen 
of cisplatin 30mg/m2 given intravenously over 60 minutes weekly during IMRT; 6 total 
doses for a total of 180 mg/m2.   However, if cisplatin was not tolerated, it was 
permissible to switch to alternative, acceptable weekly chemotherapy regimens such as 
cetuximab, carboplatin, or carboplatin/taxol.   For the proposed study, cisplatin is the 
preferred mandated first choice chemotherapy, however alternative weekly regimens are 
permissible.   Typi[INVESTIGATOR_414398] a patient not being able to receive cisplatin include renal 
insufficiency and history of hearing loss.  Justification for not using cisplatin must be 
documented.  Analysis of a prospective national registry, Longitudinal Oncology 
Registry of Head and Neck Carcinoma (LORHAN), showed that the three most 
commonly prescribed concurrent (with radiation) regimens (in order) are single agent 
cisplatin (51%), single -agent cetu ximab (21%), and carboplatin plus paclitaxel (7%).  
Single agent carboplatin was infrequently used (3%) (Wong et al. Cancer 
2011;117:1679 –86.). The acceptable weekly chemotherapy regimens that may be used on 
this study are the following:  
• Cisplatin 30  to 40 mg/m2 (preferred, first choice)  
• Cetuximab 250mg/m2 (preferred, second choice)  
• Carboplatin AUC 1.5 and paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 (preferred, third choice)

Version/Date :  10/24/2024    
12 • Carboplatin AUC 3  (preferred, fourth choice)  
Chemotherapy  will be given intravenously weekly during IMRT. 6 total doses will be 
given. It is preferred that the doses be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; 
however, this is not mandatory.   Chemotherapy will not be given to patients with T0 -2 
N0-1 disease, ≤ 10 pack years smoking history . 
5.5.1 Dose Modifications for chemotherapy :  Because of the low weekly dosage of 
chemotherapy , we anticipate few dose modifications secondary to acute 
toxicities.  Dose modifications are allowed and will be directed by [CONTACT_414415]/her discretion  on an individual patient 
basis .   
5.5.2 Changing Chemotherapy Regimens : In the event that cisplatin is held for 1 
week and the patient is still deemed unable to receive further weekly cisplatin 
(because of cisplatin -related toxicity), patient will be switched to another 
protocol -acceptable weekly chemotherapy regimen (cetuxima b, 
carboplatin/taxol, or carboplatin).  
Other changes may be done on a case -by-case basis depending on the standard of 
practice of the treat ing medical oncologist.    
5.[ADDRESS_522472]-Chemoradiotherapy Assessment of Clinical Response  
PET/CT will be performed 10 to 16 weeks (optimally at week 12) after CRT to assess 
response.  All patients will be evaluated via clinical exam and fiberoptic laryngoscopy by 
[CONTACT_414416]/CT 
scan.   Note that the fiberoptic laryngoscopy  need only be done once, at either [ADDRESS_522473] -CRT, with additional laryngoscopy procedures performed at the discretion of 
the physician.  Decisions for surgical evaluation will be based on the result s of the 
PET/CT  and clinical exam at that time .  Other optional imaging studies may be 
performed  (e.g. CT scan 4 to 6 weeks after completion of CRT ).    
5.7 Surgery after CRT  
Patients with a positive PET/CT scan will undergo surgical evaluation at the discretion  of 
the surgeon.  This may include biopsies and/or oncological resections of the primary 
tumor and lymph node metastases. The type of surgical  procedure will be left to the 
discretion  of the surgeon  however the goal will be to remove any suspected residual 
tumor with a negative resection margin while main taining organ preservation.   Patients 
with a negative PET/CT scan will be observed.    
5.8 Other Therapy  
5.8.1 Permitted Supportive Therapy:  All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will 
be given during the study period at the discretion of the attending physician(s) within the 
parameters of the protocol  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Antiemetics :  Prophylactic antiemetics and supportive therapy for nausea and 
vomiting are permitted and  highly recommended in patients participating in

13 this study. These interventions should be made  according to institutional 
guidelines.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nutritional Supplementation :  Close monitoring of patients’ volume status 
and body weight is strongly recommended.   Nutritional supplementation 
through a nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding tube should be  considered in 
patients who are unable to maintain hydration or experience more than 10% 
loss of body weight due to mucositis.  
5.8.2 Non-permitted Supportive Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematopoietic Growth Factors:  Hematopoietic growth factors are not 
permitted during radiati on therapy. Growth factors are only permitted if 
administered after radiation therapy has been completed. Erythropoiesis 
stimulating agents are not permitted.  
5.8.3 Other Supportive Care Clinical Studies:  Patients will be allowed to participate in 
other supportive care clinical studies that do not interfere with the treatment plan of the 
current study.  
5.8.4 Monitoring of Acute and Chronic Toxicities   
The NCI -CTCAE v4.0 criteria will be used to document acute and late adverse 
events/toxicities associated with CRT.    
5.9 Duration of Study  
The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the 2 year PFS rate after de -intensified  
CRT in HPV -positive and/or p16 positive OPSCC.  Patient participation concludes after 
[ADDRESS_522474] practice:  clinical evalu ations every [ADDRESS_522475]  it may decrease

7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
The main objective of this Phase -II trial is to estimate the two -year progression -free 
survival probability (PFSP) in this group of patients treated with de -escalated 
radiotherapy.  The planned total sample size is [ADDRESS_522485] implies a total study duration of 4 to 5 years.  Drop out 
is expected to be about 10%, based on a previous trial (LCCC 1120), hence we e xpect a 
total of  [ADDRESS_522486] with the null hypothesis being that the 
two-year PFSP is 0.87 and the alternative hypothesis being that the two -year PFSP is 0.80 
(or less). If the null hypothesis is rejected the conclusion will be that the de -escalated 
treatment is inferior to the standard treatment. If the null hypothesis is not rejected the 
conclusion will be that the de -escalated treatment is at least as good as the standard RT.  
 
For a sample size of 108 patients who complete the study, the null hypothesis will be 
rejected if 21 or more patients fail. The same rejection rule applies for sample sizes from 
107 to 111, with Type -I error from 0.03 4 at n= 107 to 0.049 at n= 111.  For n=112 to 117 
the null will be rejected if 22 or more patients fail, with Type -I error .031 to .047.  Failure 
is defined as not reaching the two -year time point progression -free. Defining P(Reject 
H0) to be the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis,  the performance of t he test , 
with 108 patients who complete the study,  is summarized in the following  table . 
 
True 2 -year PFSP  P(Reject H0 ) 
0.[ADDRESS_522487] will be performed as described above. Additionally, a Kaplan -
Meier cur ve will be estimated for PFS, local control, regional control, local -regional 
control , distant metastasis fre e survival and overall survival .  
 
In addition to the above, other exploratory analyses utilizing study -related data may be 
performed.

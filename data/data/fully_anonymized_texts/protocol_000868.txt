 Efficacy 
Endpoints Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment 
group that are identified as Responders at the end of the treatment period 
evaluated on Day 8 or Day 9. 
A Responder is defined as a patient with at leas t a 25% reduction from 
baseline in the sum of % basal/parabasal + % intermediate cells on vaginal 
cytology AND vaginal pH < 5.[ADDRESS_990676] 0.5. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the propo rtion of patients in each 
treatment group that are considered a Treatment Success at the end of the 
treatment period evaluated on Day 8 or Day 9. 
A “Treatment Success” is defined as a score of [ADDRESS_990677] bothersome. This evaluation 
will be based on (one) patient self-assessed symptom of VVA (vaginal 
dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, or vaginal pain 
associated with sexual activity) on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = none and 3 = severe. Evaluation of vaginal bleeding during sexual activity will be based on a s
core of 1 (presence) if it is identified by [CONTACT_725681] a score of 0 (absent) on Day 8 or Day 9.  
 
Evaluation of 
Therapeutic 
Equivalence and Superiority  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Therapeutic Equivalence : 
Therapeutic equivalence will be evaluated for both primary and secondary 
endpoints in the per-protocol  (PP) population. If the 90% confidence interval 
(calculated us ing Yates’ continuity correction) on the absolute difference 
between the proportion of patients identified as Responders in the Test and 
Reference groups (p T - p R) is contained within the range [-20%, +20%] then 
therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product will be 
considered to have been demonstrated. 
The same statistical approach will be conducted for analysis of the secondary 
endpoint in the PP population.  
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference 
product, equivalence must be demonstrated for only the primary endpoints in 
the PP population. 
Superiority to Placebo  
Superiority of the Test and Reference products against the Placebo product 
for the primary endpoint will be evaluated in the modified Intent- to-Treat  
(mITT) population using last observation carried forward (LOCF). If the

numerically and statistically superior to that of the Placebo ( p < 0.05; using a 
two-sided Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel [CMH] test, stratified by [CONTACT_68566]) 
then superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo will be 
concluded. 
The same statistical approach will be conducted for analysis of the secondary 
endpoint in the mITT population. 
To declare superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo, their 
superiority must be demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the mITT 
population. 
Treatment- by-Site Interaction and Pooling of Clinical Sites  
As this is a multiple- site study, the interaction of treatment- by-site may be 
evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint in the PP population for 
equivalence testing. The treatment- by-site interaction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_725682]-Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratio at th e 5% significance 
level ( p < 0.05, 2- sided). A site(s) with a low enrollment rate(s) may be 
pooled with its geographically closest site, so as to avoid bias in the 
stratification of the sites in the CMH test and in the estimation of a treatment-
by-site int eraction effect. The pooling will be done for low enrolling sites that 
account for less than 4- 7% of the total number of patients in the PP 
population at the site with the highest enrolling rate in the PP population. If 
the treatment- by-site interaction te rm is found to be statistically significant 
(p < 0.05) for the primary endpoint, then the interaction term will also be 
assessed for clinical relevance before pooling the data across sites. This will 
include examination of Responder rates at each site wher e sample sizes per 
treatment may be influential in the assessment of the interaction. 
Safety Analysis Adverse events (AEs) will be classified using standard Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology Version 20.0 or higher and 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Summary tables comparing the type, 
incidence, date of onset, date of resolution, severity, action taken, outcome 
and Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_192289]. If sufficient data exist, AE frequencies will be 
compared between treatments using Fisher’s exact test or a similar test. Signs 
and symptoms of VVA  will not be considered AEs, unless in the 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], they have in creased in frequency and/or severity to 
such an extent that the Investigator/patient considers that it is in the patient’s 
best interest to be dropped from continued participation in the study and 
given alternative therapy for their condition. Concomitant medication use 
during the study will be tabulated by [CONTACT_4676].

and unsolicited means and subsequently coded in tabular form using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 20.[ADDRESS_990722] resolved or stabilized. For any Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) still ongoing 
at the time of last visit, the Investigator should continue to follow up until the SAE has resolved or has stabilized / is judged permanent for SAEs considered to be related to study product (serious 
adverse drug reaction [SADRs]), and for up to [ADDRESS_990723] for non- related 
SAEs.  
10.7.1  Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse Event
: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or 
disease, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to this product. This includes events not seen at baseline, or worsened even if present at baseline. 
Serious Adverse Event: 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in  
any of the following outcomes: D eath, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725669], persistent or significant disability / incapacity ,  
a congenital anomaly / birth defect (See Section 10.8.1). 
Unexpected Adverse Event : An AE where the nature or severity of is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational 
product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
Adverse Drug Reaction : All noxious and unintended responses to a medical product related to 
any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs) . The response to a ‘medical 
product’ means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a 
reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction : An Unexpected Adverse Reaction  is defined 
as an ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the Referen ce Safety 
Information. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  are “unexpected” SAEs 
and SADRs in which the temporal relationship of the clinical event to study treatment 
administration makes a causal relationship possible , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions 
or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

document will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI) as a basis for expectedness 
assessment. 
10.7.2  Severity of Adverse Event 
The severity of the AE will be graded by [CONTACT_192326]: 
• MILD: Awareness of symptom but does not interfere with routine ac tivities.  
• MODERATE: Discomfort sufficient to interfere with routine activities. Prescription drug 
therapy may have been employed to treat the AE. 
• SEVERE: Impossible to perform routine activities. Prescription drug therapy and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_725670] 
10.7.[ADDRESS_990725] will be evaluated by [CONTACT_73951]: 
• Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility, or the subject did not take the study product. 
• Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
10.8 Serious Adverse Events 
10.8.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
A seri ous adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose suggests a 
medically significant hazard, including any event that: 
• Results in death: includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to 
study treatment (e.g., car accident where patient is a passenger). 
• Is life-threatening: in the view of the Investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the event. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Causes congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ).

11.3 Study Populations 
11.3.1  Per-Protocol Population 
The PP population will include all randomized patients who: 
• Met the inclusion/exclusion criteria as defined in this protocol at Visit 1 and 2. 
• Did not have any significant protocol deviations. 
• Did not develop any concurrent vaginal infection or illness exhibiting symptoms similar to VVA, or symptoms that in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_725671]. 
• Completed the last study visit (Visit 3) within window (Day 8 or Day 9 ). 
• Were compliant with dosing between 75%-125% of the required doses. 
Any patient who withdraws from the study because of lack of efficacy will be included in the PP 
population as a Non-Responder, provided they did not have any significant protocol deviations that would affect treatment evaluation. 
11.3.2  Modified Intent- to-Treat Population

11.4 Baseline Comparability 
Baseline comparability of all treatment groups will be evaluated separately in the PP, m ITT and 
Safety populations. The following baseline demographics (determined from their initial study visit) 
will be evaluated: 
• Age (years) 
• Gender (male/female) 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic) 
• Race (White, Black/African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Other) 
• Natural or surgical menopause 
• Duration of postmenopausal status 
• Baseline signs and symptoms 
• Baseline % of the three major vaginal wall cell types (basal/parabasal cells, intermediate cells 
and superficial cells) 
• Vaginal pH 
Summary tables by [CONTACT_2058]. Continuous variables will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (number of observations, median, minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation). Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentage. Baseline 
treatment comparisons will be presented using Chi-Square or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests 
for the categorical variables, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for the continuous variables. 
All data will be listed by [CONTACT_117912]. 
11.5 Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group that are identified 
as Responders at the end of the treatment period evaluated on Day 8 or Day 9. 
A “Responder” is defined as a patient with at least a 25% reduction from baseline in the sum of % 
basal/parabasal + % intermediate cells on vaginal cytology AND vaginal pH < 5.[ADDRESS_990728] 0.5. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients in each treatment group that are 
considered a Treatment Success at the end of the treatment period evaluated on Day 8 or Day 9.

 A “Treatment Success” is defined as a score of [ADDRESS_990729] bothersome. This evaluation will be based on (one) patient self- assessed 
symptom of VVA  (vaginal dryness, vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria, or vaginal p ain 
associated with sexual activity ) on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = none and 3 = severe. Evaluation of 
vaginal bleeding during sexual activity will be based on a Score of 1 (presence) if it is identified by [CONTACT_725690] a score of 0 (absent) on Day 8 or Day 9. 
Refer to Appendix B for rating scale s. 
11.6 Efficacy Analyses 
Primary Endpoint Analysis
 
Therapeutic Equivalence:  
Therapeutic equivalence will be evaluated for both primary and secondary endpoints in the PP population. If the 90% confidence interval (calculated using Yates’ continuity correction) on the 
absolute difference between the proportion of patients identified as Responders in the Test and 
Reference groups (p
T - p R) is contained within the range [-20%, +20%] then therapeutic equivalence 
of the Test product to the Reference product will be considered to have been demonstrated. 
The same statistical approach will be conducted for analysis of the secondary endpoint in the PP 
population. 
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product, equivalence must be 
demonstrated for only the primary endpoints in the PP population. 
Superiority to Placebo  
Superiority of the Test and Reference products against the Placebo product for the primary endpoint 
will be evaluated in the mITT population using last observation carried forward (LOCF). If the 
proportion of Responders in the Test and the Reference product groups is numerically and statistically 
superior to that of the Placebo ( p < 0.05; using a two-sided CMH test, stratified by [CONTACT_68566]) then 
superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo will be concluded. 
The same statistical approach will be conducted for analysis of the secondary endpoint in the mITT 
population. 
To declare superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo, their superiority must be 
demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the mITT population. 
Treatment- by-Site Interaction and Pooling of Clinical Sites  
As this is a multiple-site study, the interaction of treatment- by-site may be evaluated for the primary 
efficacy endpoint in the PP population for equivalence testing. The treatment- by-site interaction will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_117889]-Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratio at the 5% significance level 
(p < 0.05, 2-sided). A site(s) with a low enrollment rate(s) may be pooled with its geographically 
closest site, so as to avoid bias in the stratification of the sites in the CMH test and in the estimation 
of a treatment- by-site interaction effect. The pooling will be done for low enrolling sites that account 
for less than 4-7% of the total number of patients in the PP population at the site with the highest

significant ( p < 0.05) for the primary endpoint, then the interaction term will also be assessed for 
clinical relevance before pooling the data across sites. This will include examination of “Responder”

WARNING: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER,  CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, 
BREAST CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA  
 
 
Estrogen-Alone Therapy   
 
Endometrial Cancer  
 
There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman w ith a uterus who uses unopposed 
estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen th erapy has been shown to reduce the risk of 
endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometri al cancer. Adequate diagnostic 
measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be 
undertaken to rule out maligna ncy in postmenopausal women w ith undiagnosed persistent or 
recurring abnormal genital bleeding [see WARNINGS, Malignant Neoplasms, Endometrial 
Cancer ]. 
 
Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  
 
Estrogen-alone therapy should not  be used for the prevention of  cardiovascular disease or 
dementia [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders , and 
Probable Dementia ]. 
 
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen -alone substudy reported increased risks of 
stroke and deep vein thrombos is (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) 
during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral  conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg]-alone, 
relative to placebo [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular 
Disorders ]. 
 
The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alo ne ancillary study of WHI reported an 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_725675] n 65 years of age or 
older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily CE  (0.625 mg) -alone, relative to placebo. It is 
unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [see CLINICAL 
STUDIES and WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ]. 
 
In the absence of comparable data, these risk s should be assumed to be similar for other 
doses of CE and other dosa ge forms of estrogens. 
 
Estrogens with or without progestins should be pr escribed at the lowest effective do ses and for 
the shortest duration consistent with treatme nt goals and risks for the individual woman. 
 
 
 
Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy  
 
Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia  
 
Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the preventi on of cardiovascular 
disease or dementia [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular 
Disorders , and Probable Dementia ]. 
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of DVT, pulmonary 
embolism (PE), stroke and myoc ardial infarction (MI) in pos tmenopausal women (50 to 79 
years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral CE (0.625 mg) combined with 
medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo [see CLINICAL 
STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders ]. 
 
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_725676] 65 years of age or older during 4 
years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA ( 2.5 mg), relative to 
placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [see 
CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, 
Geriatric Use ]. 
 
Breast Cancer  
 
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive 
breast cancer [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Malignant Neoplasms, Breast 
Cancer ]. 
 
In the absence of comparable data, these risk s should be assumed to be similar for other 
doses of CE and MPA, and other combinations and dosag e forms of estrogens and 
progestins. 
 
Estrogens with or without progestins should be pr escribed at the lowest effective do ses and for 
the shortest duration consistent with treatme nt goals and risks for the individual woman. 
 
 
 
 
 
DESCRIPTION 
Each gram of ESTRACE (estradi ol vaginal cream, USP, 0.01%) contains 0.1 mg estradiol in a 
nonliquefying base containing purified water, propylene glycol, stearyl alcohol, white ceresin 
wax, mono- and di-glycerides, hypromellose  2208 (4000 cps), sodium lauryl sulfate, 
methylparaben, edetate di-sodium and tertiary -butylhydroquinone. Estradiol is chemically 
described as estra-1,3,5(10)-trien e-3, 17(beta)-diol. It has an empi[INVESTIGATOR_299754] C 18H24O2 and 
molecular weight of 272.37. The structural formula is: 
 
 
 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development a nd maintenance of the 
female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics.  Although circulating estrogens 

exist in a dynamic equilibriu m of metabolic interconversions , estradiol is the principal 
intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and 
estriol at the receptor level. 
 
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which 
secretes [ADDRESS_990744] been identified.  These vary in proportion fr om tissue to tissue. 
 
Circulating estrogens modulate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_725677], luteinizing hormone 
(LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. 
Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of  these hormones seen in postmenopausal women. 
 
Pharmacokinetics  
 
Absorption  
 
Estrogen drug products are absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and the 
gastrointestinal tract after release from the drug formulation. 
 
Distribution  
 
The distribution of exogenous estr ogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are 
widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs.  Estrogens circulate in the blood la rgely bound to sex hormone binding 
globulin (SHBG) and albumin. 
 
Metabolism  
 
Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same  manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating 
estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions.  These transformations take place mainly in th e liver.  Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be 
converted to estriol, which is the major urinary metabolite.  Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucur onide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates 
into the intestine, and hydrol ysis in the gut followed by [CONTACT_725691].  In postmenopausal 
women, a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, 
especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active 
estrogens. 
 
Excretion  
Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in  the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate 
conjugates. 
 
Special Populations  
 
No pharmacokinetic studies were  conducted in special populations, including patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment. 
 
Drug Interactions  
 
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug 
metabolism.  Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John’s Wort preparations (Hypericum 
perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of 
estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in th erapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine 
bleeding profile.  Inhibitors of  CYP3A4 such as erythromyci n, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may in crease plasma concentra tions of estrogens and 
may result in side effects. 
 
CLINICAL STUDIES  
 
Women’s Health Initiative Studies  
 
The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two 
substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE ( 0.625 mg)-alone or in combination 
with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in th e prevention of certain chronic diseases. The 
primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary  heart disease (CHD) (defined as nonfatal MI, 
silent MI and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A “global index” included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These subst udies did not evaluate the effe cts of CE or CE plus MPA on 
menopausal symptoms. 
 
WHI Estrogen-Alone Substudy 
 
The WHI estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was 
observed, and it was deemed that no further information would be  obtained regarding the risks 
and benefits of estrogen-alone in  predetermined primary endpoints. 
Results of the estrogen-alone substudy, which included 10,739 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79; 75.3 percent White, 15.1 percent Black, 6.1 percent Hispanic, 3.6 percent 
Other), after an average follow-up of  7.1 years are presented in Table 1.  
 
 
a 
TABLE 1 -Relative and Absolu te Risk Seen in the Estr ogen-Alone Substudy of WHI  
 
 
For those outcomes included in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance, the 
absolute excess risk per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE-alone was 12 more 
strokes, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-ye ars was 7 fewer hip fractures1. 
The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was a non-significant 5 events 
per 10,000 women-years. There was no difference between the groups in terms of all-cause 
mortality. 
 
No overall difference for primary CHD events (nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death) and 
invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE-alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.[ADDRESS_990745] reduced risk for CHD [hazard ratio 
(HR) 0.63 (95 percent CI, 0.36-1.09)] and overall mortality [HR 0.71 (95 percent CI, 0.46–  
1.11)] . 
 
WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy 
 
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was also stopped early. According to the predefined 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], after an average fo llow-up of 5.[ADDRESS_990746] 
cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded th e specified benefits included in the “global 
index.” The absolute excess risk of events included in the “globa l index” was 19 per 10,000 
women-years. 
 
For those outcomes included in the WHI “global index” that reached statistical significance after 
5.[ADDRESS_990747] cancers, while the ab solute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer 
colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. 
 
Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, 
range 50 to 79; 83.9 percent White , 6.8 percent Black, 5.4 percent Hispanic, 3.9 percent Other), 
are presented in Table 2. These re sults reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow- 
up of 5.[ADDRESS_990748] reduced risk for overall 
mortality [HR 0.69 (95 percent CI, 0.44-1.07)] . 
 
Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study 
 
The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 pr edominantly healthy 
hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age and ol der (45 percent were 
65 to 69 years of age; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; 19 percent were 75 years of 
age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone on the incidence of 
probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo. 
 
After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the rela tive risk of probable dementia for CE-alone 
versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for 
CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 ca ses per 10,000 women-years.  Probable dementia 
as defined in this study included Alzheimer’s di sease (AD), vascular de mentia (VaD) and mixed 
types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classi fication of probable 
dementia in the treatment group and the place bo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was 

conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to 
younger postmenopausal women [see BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS, Probable 
Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ]. 
 
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4,532 predominantly 
healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age a nd older (47 percent were 65 to 69 years of 
age; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years; 18 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg ) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the in cidence of probable dementia 
(primary outcome) compared to placebo. 
 
After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative  risk of probable deme ntia for CE plus MPA 
versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for 
CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as 
defined in this study included AD, VaD and mixed types (having fe atures of both AD and 
VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the 
placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of 
age, it is unknown whether these findings a pply to younger postmenopausal women [see 
WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ]. 
 
When data from the two populatio ns were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the 
reported overall relativ e risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). 
Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown 
whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [see WARNINGS, Probable 
Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ].

Systemic absorption may occur with the use of ESTRACE (est radiol vaginal cream, USP, 
0.01%).  The warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions associated with oral estrogen 
treatment should be taken into account. 
 
1. Cardiovascular Disorders  
 
An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been  reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An 
increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin 
therapy. Should any of these occur or be susp ected, estrogen with or wi thout progestin therapy 
should be discontinued immediately. 
 
Risk factors for arterial  vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, 
hypercholesterolemia, and obesi ty) and/or venous thromboem bolism (VTE) (e.g., personal 
history or family history of VT E, obesity, and systemic lupus er ythematosus) should be managed 
appropriately. 
 
a. Stroke  
 
In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age rece iving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to 
women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted [see CLINICAL STUDIES]. 
Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estr ogen-alone therapy s hould be discontinued 
immediately. 
 
Subgroup analyses of women [ADDRESS_990749] no increase d risk of stroke for 
those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 
10,000 women-years) 
3. 
 
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke 
was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 vers us 25 per 10,000 women- 
years) [see CLINICAL STUDIES] . The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year 
and persisted
3. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be 
discontinued immediately. 
 
b. Coronary Heart Disease 
 
In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events 
(defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death) was reported  in women receiving estrogen- 
alone compared to placebo4 [see CLINICAL STUDIES ]. 
Subgroup analyses of women [ADDRESS_990750] a statistically non-significant 
reduction in CHD events (CE [ 0.625 mg]-alone compared to pl acebo) in women with less 
than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years) 3. 
 
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased 
risk of CHD events reported in women re ceiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) 
compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years) 3. An increase in 
relative risk was demonstrated  in year 1, and a trend toward  decreasing relative risk was 
reported in years 2 through 5 [see CLINICAL STUDIES ]. 
 
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763), average age 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and 
Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA 
(2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiova scular benefit.  During an av erage follow-up of 4.1 years, 
treatment with CE plus MPA di d not reduce the overall rate of CHD even ts in postmenopausal 
women with established coronary heart disease.  There were more  CHD events in the CE plus 
MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hund red and twenty one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial 
agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II.  Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall.  Rates of CHD events were 
comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the plac ebo group in HERS, HERS II, 
and overall. 
 
c. Venous Thromboembolism  
 
In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women 
receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women receiving placebo (30 versus 22 per 
10,000 women-years), although only the increased ri sk of DVT reached st atistical significance 
(23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-ye ars). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the 
first 2 years5 [see CLINICAL STUDIES ]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen- 
alone therapy should be di scontinued immediately. 
 
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000  women-years). Statistically significant 
increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also de monstrated. The increase in VTE risk was observed during 
the first year and persisted 
6[see CLINICAL STUDIES ]. Should a VTE occur or be suspected, 
estrogen plus progestin therapy shou ld be discontinued immediately. 
 
If feasible, estrogens should be  discontinued at least [ADDRESS_990751] cancer in 
estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone. In the WHI estrogen- alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not 
associated with an increased risk of inva sive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80) 
7 [see 
CLINICAL STUDIES ]. 
 
The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in 
estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg). After a mean follow-up of 5.[ADDRESS_990752] cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positiv e, and were diagnosed at  a more advanced stage 
in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic 
disease was rare with no appare nt difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors 
such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups
8 
[see CLINICAL STUDIES ]. 
 
Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observation al studies have also re ported an increased risk 
of breast cancer for estrogen pl us progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen- 
alone therapy, after several years of use. The risk increased with duration of  use, and appeared to 
return to baseline in about 5 years after stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_056] (only the observational studies have 
substantial data on risk af ter stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). Observationa l studies also suggest that the risk of breast 
cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier,  with estrogen plus progestin therapy as 
compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant 
variation in the risk of breas t cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, 
doses, or routes of  administration. 
 
The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an 
increase in abnormal mammogram s requiring further evaluation. 
 
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. 
 
c. Ovarian Cancer  
 
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-sign ificant increased risk 
of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI, 0.77-3.24). The absolute risk for CE plus MPA was 4 versus 3 case s per 10,000 women-years 
9. In some epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], the use of 
estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovari an cancer. However, the duration of exposure 
associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], and some report 
no association. 
 
3. Probable Dementia  
 
In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized 
women 65 to 79 years of age was randomize d to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. 
 
After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 wome n in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in 
the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable 
dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83 -2.66). The absolute risk of 
probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 case s per 10,000 women-years 
10 [see CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ]. 
 
In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a popul ation of 4,532 postmenopausal 
women 65 to 79 years of age wa s randomized to daily CE ( 0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or 
placebo. 
 
After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 wome n in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in 
the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable 
dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk 
of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 vers us 22 cases per 10,000 
women-years 10 [see CLINICAL STUDIES and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ]. 
When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estr ogen plus progestin 
ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protoc ol, the reported overall relative 
risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Sinc e both ancillary studies were 
conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to 
younger postmenopausal women 10 [see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ]. 
 
4. Gallbladder Disease  
 
A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbla dder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal 
women receiving estrogens has been reported. 
 
5. Hypercalcemia  
 
Estrogen administration may lead to severe hy percalcemia in patients with breast cancer and 
bone metastases. If hypercalcemia occurs, use of  the drug should be stopped and appropriate 
measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level. 
 
6. Visual Abnormalities 
 
Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens.  Discontinue 
medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or comp lete loss of vision, or a sudden 
onset of proptosis, diplop ia, or migraine.  If examination rev eals papi[INVESTIGATOR_725678], estrogens should be permanently discontinued. 
 
7. Anaphylactic Reaction and Angioedema  
 
Cases of anaphylaxis, which develop within minutes to hours after taking orally-administered 
estrogen and require emergency medical manageme nt, have been reported in the postmarketing 
setting. Skin (hives, pruritis, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]) or gastrointestinal tract (abdomin al pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted. 
 
 
Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, hands and feet requiring medical intervention 
has occurred postmarketing in patients taking orally-administered estrogen. If angioedema 
involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur. Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with  or without angioedema after trea tment with oral estrogen should not 
receive oral estrogen again. 
 
8. Hereditary Angioedema  
 
Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in wo men with hereditary 
angioedema . 
 
 
 
PRECAUTIONS 
A. General  
1. Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy  
 
Studies of the addition of a proges tin for [ADDRESS_990753] of estrogen s on blood pressure was not seen. 
 
3. Hypertriglyceridemia  
 
In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications. Consider 
discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs. 
 
4. Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice  
 
Estrogens may be poorly metaboliz ed in patients with impaired liver function.  For women with 
a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen us e or with pregnancy, caution 
should be exercised and in th e case of recurrence, medica tion should be discontinued. 
 
5. Hypothyroidism  
 
Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels.  Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by [CONTACT_725692], thus maintaining free T
[ADDRESS_990754]-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin s hould be considered. 
 
9. Exacerbation of Other Conditions  
 
Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with 
caution in women with these conditions. 
 
B. Patient Information  
 
Physicians are advised to discuss the PATIENT INFORMATION leaflet with women for whom 
they prescribe ESTRACE (estradi ol vaginal cream, USP, 0.01%). 
 
 
C. Laboratory Tests  
 
 
Serum FSH and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and va ginal atrophy. 
 
D. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions  
 
1.   Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; 
increased platelet count; increased factors II , VII antigen, VIII antigen, VIII coagulant 
activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, II-VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity; increased levels of fibrinogen a nd fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen 
antigen and activity. 
2.   Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid 
hormone levels, as measured by  [CONTACT_109414]-bound iodine (PBI), T
4 levels (by [CONTACT_725693]) or T 3 levels by [CONTACT_243359]. T 3 resin uptake is decreased, 
reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T 4 and free T 3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on 
thyroid replacement therapy may require higher dose of thyroid hormone. 
3.   Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin 
(CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating 
corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma  proteins may be increased 
(angiotensinogen/renin s ubstrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). 
4.   Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL
2 cholesterol subfraction 
concentrations, reduced low-density lipopr otein (LDL) choleste rol concentration, 
increased triglycerides levels. 
5.   Impaired glucose tolerance. 
 
E. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility  
 
Long-term continuous administration of estroge n, with and without progestin, in women with 
and without a uterus, has shown an increased risk of  endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and 
ovarian cancer.  (See BOXED WARNINGS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .) 
 
Long term continuous administratio n of natural and synthetic estrog ens in certain animal species 
increases the frequency of carci nomas of the breast, uterus, ce rvix, vagina, testis, and liver. 
 
F. Pregnancy  
 
ESTRACE should not be used during pregnancy [see CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. 
 
There appears to be lit tle or no increased risk of birth de fects in children born to women who 
have used estrogens and progestins as an oral contraceptive inadvertently during early 
pregnancy. 
 
G. Nursing Mothers  
 
ESTRACE should not be used during lactation. Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk.  Detectable amounts of 
estrogens have been identified in the milk of women receiving estrogen therapy.  Caution should be exercised when ESTRACE is ad ministered to a nursing woman. 
 
H. Pediatric Use  
 
ESTRACE Vaginal Cream is not i ndicated in children. Clinical st udies have not been conducted 
in the pediatric population. 
 
I. Geriatric Use  
 
 
There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients involved in studies utilizing ESTRACE to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to ESTRACE. 
 
The Women’s Health Initiative Study  
 
In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg]-alone versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of stroke in wo men greater than 65 years of age [see CLINICAL 
STUDIES and WARNINGS].  
 
In the WHI estrogen plus pr ogestin substudy (daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] 
versus placebo), there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke  and invasive breast 
cancer in women greater th an 65 years of age [see CLINICAL STUDIES and 
WARNINGS].  
 
The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study 
 
In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age, there 
was an increased risk of de velopi[INVESTIGATOR_725679]-alone 
or estrogen plus progestin wh en compared to placebo [see CLINICAL STUDIES and 
WARNINGS].  
 
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown 
whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women 10 [see CLINICAL 
STUDIES and WARNINGS].

OVERDOSAGE  
 
Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, abdominal pain, 
drowsiness and fatigue, and withdrawal bleeding may occur in women. Treatment of overdose 
consists of discontinuation of ESTRACE therapy together with institution of appropriate 
symptomatic care. 
 
 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
 
Use of ESTRACE alone or  in combination with a progestin, should be limited to the shortest 
duration consistent with treatme nt goals and risks for the individual woman.  Postmenopausal 
women should reevaluate pe riodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still 
necessary.  For treatment of vul var and vaginal atrophy associated with the menopause, the 
lowest dose and regimen that will control symp toms should be chosen and medication should be 
discontinued as promptly as possible.  For women who have a uterus, adequate diagnostic measures, including directed and random e ndometrial sampling when  indicated, should be 
undertaken to rule out malignanc y in cases of undiagnosed pers istent or recurring abnormal 
genital bleeding. 
 
Usual Dosage: The usual dosage range is 2 to 4 g (marked on the applicator ) daily for one or two 
weeks, then gradually reduced to one half initial dosage for a similar period. A maintenance dosage of 1 g, one to three times a week, may be used after restoration of the vaginal mucosa has 
been achieved. 
 
NOTE: The number of doses per tube will vary with dosage requirements and patient handling.

Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2, prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single -dose, 
multicenter  study to evaluate the efficacy of FX -322, administered by [CONTACT_727652], in adults with acquired sensorineural hearing loss  (SNHL) .  
 Previous human studies in subjects 18 to 65 years inclusive (FX -322-103, FX -322-201, FX -
322-111) and subjects 66- 85 inclusive (FX -322-112) demonstrated that a single dose FX -322 
was well tolerated in patients with acquired SNHL with no treatment- related serious adverse 
events. Adve rse events in these studies were generally common to and associated with the 
intratympanic injection procedure with mild and transient discomfort in patients both with the drug and the placebo (McLean et al., 2021) . 
 In previous single -dose human studies i n subjects 18- 65 years inclusive (FX -322-201, FX -
322-111) it was demonstrated that treatment with FX -[ADDRESS_993834] two Parts as described below : 
Part A: Screening/Start of Lead -in/Visit 1Lead -in/Visit 2  
Part B: Randomization, Treatment, Follow -up, and Observation  
Part A  
Screening/Start of Lead -In:  Visits  can occur 30 -40 days prior to study drug administration 
[Visit 3 ( Day 1) ]. All subjects will be evalua ted to determine study eligibility. For the 
purpose of ensuring the integrity of the trial and minimizing bias, certain study design details are further described within a separate, restricted -access unmasked protocol addendum. As 
part of recording the medical history of subjects, concurrent use of hearing aids during the study will be documented, as well as hearing loss etiology and laterality (unilateral, bilateral) .  
Eligible s ubjects will be required to return for Lead- in/Visit 2 ( 14-18 days after Visit 1 ) to 
complete assessments.  Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_727653] a medical change has occurred during the lead -in period ( Visit 1 to  pre-dose Visit 3 ).  
Eligible  subjects will return for Visit 3  and will be evaluated to determine whether they meet 
appropriate Inclusion/Exclusion criteria required for randomization.

 Part B  
Randomization, Treatment, Follow -up, and Observation:  Approximately 124 subjects are 
planned to be randomized in this study.  The subjects will be randomized to receive FX -322 or 
placebo according to the different treatment group assignments listed below:  
 
Treatment 
Group  # of 
Subjects  Day [ADDRESS_993835] has been identified as meeting all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, including the 
criteria described within the unmasked addendum which will be determined via the electronic data capture (EDC) system, the subject will be randomized. FX-322 or placebo will be 
administered at Visit 3  (Day 1). The syringes containing either placebo or FX -[ADDRESS_993836] will be placed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_41459] (with the exception of 
phenol) will be administered directly to the tympanic membrane. Under a microscope, a [ADDRESS_993837] trained and experienced in performing intratympanic injections. Safety monitoring will include recording of adverse events (AEs), monitoring of audiology, tympanometry, otoscopic exams, and C -SSRS.  
Follow up : Subject s will be required to return to clinic for safety, otologic, and audiologic 
assessments at  Days 30 (Visit 4) , 60 (Visit 5) , and 90 (Visit 6)  following the study injection. 
Unscheduled visits may occur as needed.  
Observation:  Subjects will return to clinic for safety, otologic, and audiologic assessments at 
Days 180 (Visit 7) and 270 (Visit 8) .   
 
Number of Subjects  to be Randomized :  
Approximately 124 randomized  subjects in order to obtain a target of 112 evaluable subjects . 
 
Study Duration:  
Part A: 30 -40 days  
Part B: 90 days  
 
Study Population:  
Male and female adults (18 -65 years inclusive ), otherwise healthy with acquired 
sensorineural hearing loss, with screening PTA values between [ADDRESS_993838] 
a medical history that is consistent with adult- onset SNHL that is acquired based on medical 
histories consistent with exposure to noise (Johnson et al ., 2017) or as a result of sudden 
sensorineural loss.

 Statistical Analysis:  
Sample Size:  The sample size of 112 evaluable subjects, in a 1:1 allocation ratio of FX -322 
and Placebo  provides 80% to show improvements in WR . 
 
Statistical Methods: Descriptive summaries will be provided for patient disposition, 
demographic and baseline disease data by [CONTACT_1570].   
Efficacy analysis of  continuous endpoints will be examined via a Mixed Model for Repeated 
Measures (MMRM).  Inf erential analyses for categorical endpoints will be analysed using 
univariate methods and/or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) (or appropriate 
longitudinal methods as detailed in the SAP).  When appropriate, models will include adjustments for baseli ne as well as the stratification factors used at randomization and 
clinically relevant confounders as identified in the SAP.  Departures of these models from the statistical assumptions will be assessed and alternative approaches maybe employed.   
Summary statistics for efficacy endpoints will be provided by [CONTACT_727654]. Comparisons between FX -322 and placebo and 95% confidence 
interval of the difference will also be calculated.  
The incidence of treatment -emerg ent adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_727655] (MedDRA®).  Tabulations will be provided by [CONTACT_12917], severity, and relationship to study drug.  Audiology, tympanometry and ot ologic data will be presented as summary statistics at each 
timepoint as well as changes from baseline and/or shift tables. All subjects exposed to study drug will be included in the Safety Analysis Set and included in the safety analyses according to the actual treatment group regardless of the randomized assignment.   
Details of all planned statistical analyses and methods will be provided in the SAP, and will 
be finalized prior to study blind break for the primary analysis.

 7 INTRODUCTION 
Worldwide, an estimated 1.5 billion people currently experience hearing loss due to exposure 
to damaging levels of sound, with an anticipated 2.5 billion afflicted by 2050, including 1.1 
billion young people at risk for hearing loss due to loud sounds over long periods ( WHO 
2021). According to the US National Institutes of Health, approxi mately [ADDRESS_993853] FX-
322 is designed to activate cochlear progenitor cells leading to the development of new sensory ha ir cells and new progenitor cells, and these regenerative mechanistic steps translate 
to a restoration of hearing function in patients with SNHL.  
SNHL accounts for about 90% of all cases of hearing loss ( Li 2017). Leading causes include 
noise exposure, ototoxic medications, advanced age, inherited, and autoimmune disorders. 
SNHL is usually irreversible and managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Noise is a 
major occupational and environmental hazard, causing hearing loss, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and hypertension ( Hong 2013). SNHL has long been recognized as the primary and 
direct health effect of excessive noise exposure ( Basner 2015). In the [LOCATION_002], an 
estimated 48 million people or 20.3% of the population 12 years or older has hearing loss in one or both ears ( Lin 2011). The World Health Organization reported that 16% of the 
disabling hearing loss in adults is attributable to occupational noise exposure ( Nelson 2005). 
Hearing loss is associated with increased disability, dementia, clinic ally relevant depression, 
anxiety, stress and other mental health disorders, especially in the elderly ( Choi 2016) 
(McGilton 2016) (Deal 2016) (Brody 2018) (Curhan 2019) (Hsu 2016) (Cosh 2019) (Amieva 
2018) (Jayakody 2018 ).
  
FX-322 intratympanic injection is indicated for improvement in speech perception in patients 
with acquired sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). FX-[ADDRESS_993854] contains  
 
 FX-322 has been developed 
as the maximal feasible dose (MFD) that allows the highest amount of the actives which can be contained in the formulation without affecting its gelation properties.  is 
contained in several pharmaceutical products approved for human use including at 15.1% (w/w) for intratympanic use. 
FX-[ADDRESS_993855] synergistically to induc e a regenerative response in cochlear tissue by [CONTACT_727658]5+ progenitor cells to become inner ear hair cells while 
retaining progenitor cells (which also function as a defined subset of supporting cells) (McLean et al., 2017) an d thus may restore hearing function in patients with acquired SNHL. 
In preclinical experiments, a fixed ratio dose combination of FX03 and Valproate Sodium demonstrates:  

 
FX-322- 208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 20 of 64  
 • Expansion of the Lgr5+ progenitor cells and subsequent conversion into hair cells 
using newborn and adult cells. Substantial Lgr5+ cell expansion occurs with the combination of agents but not with the individual agents.  
• Expansion of progenitor cells from  adult primate inner ear, and expansion and 
subsequent conversion of progenitor cells i nto hair cells  from the adult human inner 
ear. 
• Formation of new hair cells in ototoxin damaged mouse cochlear explants. 
• Significant improvement in hearing and hair cell numbers in an adult mouse model of noise-induced hearing loss. 
 FX-[ADDRESS_993856] of these trials,  FX-322-103, nine patients undergoing 
cochlear implantation surgery received a single unilateral  intratympanic injection of FX -322 
(6 patients) or placebo (3 patients)  to study tolerability, systemic drug exposure, and  cochlea r 
drug exposure . The results demonstrated acceptable local and systemic acute tolerability and 
very limited  systemic exposure that  was unmeasurable within [ADDRESS_993857] clinical trial was a Phase ½ (FX -322-201) randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled single-dose study in adults with mild to moderately severe stable sensorineural 
hearing loss. The objectives of this study were to assess: 1) the systemic safety of two dose 
levels of FX -322; 2) the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of FX -322; and 3) the effect of FX-
322 on otologic and audiologic measures. After intratympanic injection of FX-322, there 
were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or AE s that led to a subject withdrawal or death . The 
most fre quently reported TEAEs that were reported, such as ear discomfort and pain, were all 
transient, generally mild and typi[INVESTIGATOR_727646]. One subject treated with FX -322H was observed with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_727647] [ADDRESS_993858] atistically significant 
improvement in measures of hearing function for patients treated with FX-322 versus patients 
given placebo. FX-322 patients showed an improvement in hearing function from baseline to 

 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 21 of 64  
 Day 90. The notable improvements in these measure s of hearing function were generally 
observed in FX -322 patients within 15- 30 days of treatment, they were sustained for 90 days, 
and when responders were retested 1 -2 years later the improvements in auditory function 
were maintained.  
 
Preliminary results are available from a recently completed open -label, single -dose study of 
FX-322 (FX -322-111) designed to evaluate the impact of injection conditions on tolerability. 
In the multi- center, randomized study, subjects with mild to severe SNHL (n=33) were injec ted 
in one ear with FX -322, with the untreated ear as the control. Hearing function was tested over 
the course of 90 days following dosing. At this timepoint, thirty- four percent (34%) of subjects 
achieved a ten percent (10%) or greater absolute improvemen t in word recognition scores in 
the treated ear, which was clinically meaningful and statistically significant compared to the untreated ear (p <0.05).  
 A Phase 1b (FX -322-112) randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, single dose, 
multicenter, safety  study in adults with age related sensorineural hearing loss did not show 
significant treatment effect with FX -[ADDRESS_993859] compromised the ability of study FX -322-202 to 
precisely and accurately assess any treatment effects of FX -322 with multiple injections.  
 As a result, efficacy results were confounded by [CONTACT_727659]/exclusion and a potential placebo effect. 
 
8 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
8.1 Known Potential Benefits  
The active ingredients in FX -322 target two cellular mechanisms, histone deacetylase 
(HDAC)  inhibition  and [COMPANY_004] -[ADDRESS_993860] demonstrated 1) t he ability to induce  progenitor cell 
expansion and su bsequent conversion into new hair cell s across species , including human, 2)  
restoration of  hair cells  in ototoxin- damaged mouse cochlear implants , and 3)  a significant 
improvement in hearing and hair cell numbers  in an adult mouse model of noise -induced 
hearing loss . 
Most recently it has been shown in a number of studies that in humans with stable mild to 
moderately severe SNHL, a single intratympanic dose of FX -[ADDRESS_993861] been carefully studied in nonclinical 
toxicology studies, as well as in a number of clinical trials. Based on these studies, the risks appear to be similar to those experienced with intratympanic injections of other ma terials, 
such as steroids, that are not FDA-approved. The risks of single intratympanic injections are characterized as persistent eardrum perforation, pain or bleeding with injection, temporary dizziness, middle ear infection, and conductive or sensorineural hearing loss. A published clinical trial using multiple intratympanic injections of a steroid in SSNHL patients has shown the majority of adverse events to be associated with the injection procedure , with 
eardrum perforations reported at  less than 4% (Rauch et al., 2011; McLean et al., 2021).  
8.3 Assessment of  Potential Risks  and Benefits  
Based on the very low potential for risk, which is primarily associated with the intratympanic injection procedure, compared to the potential benefit which is the possibility of restoration of hearing, the risk/benefit profile is considered acceptable to conduct the study described herein.

10.2 Description  
This is a Phase 2, prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single -dose, 
multicenter  study to evaluate the efficacy of FX -322, administered by [CONTACT_727652], in adults with acquired sensorineural hearing loss  (SNHL) .  
 Previous human studies in subjects 18 to 65 years inclusive (FX -322-103, FX -322-201, FX -
322-111) and subjects 66- 85 inclusive (FX -322-112) demonstrated that a single dose of FX -
322 was well tolerated in patients with acquired SNHL with no treatment -related serious 
adverse events. A dverse events in these studies were common to and associated with the 
intratympanic injection procedure with mild and transient discomfort in patients both with the drug and the placebo.

 10.3 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
The active ingredients in FX -322 target two cellular mechanisms, histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) and [COMPANY_004]- [ADDRESS_993866] FX -322 may improve  hearing function to some degree in humans. 
Previous human studies in subjects 18 to 65 years inclusive (FX -322-103, FX -322-201, FX -
322-111) and subjects 66- 85 inclusive (FX -322-112) demonstrated that a single dose FX -322 
was well tolerated in patients with acquired SNHL with no treatment- related serious adverse 
events. Adverse events in these studies were common to and associated with the 
intratympanic injection procedure with mild and transient discomfort in patients both with the drug and the placebo.  
 In previous single -dose human studies in subjects 18- 65 years inclusive (FX -322-201, FX -
322-111) it was demonstrated that treatment with FX -[ADDRESS_993867] completed the study if he or she has completed all follow -
up visits, including Visit  6 (Day 90).
 
10.5 Selection of Study Population  
10.5.1 Number of P lanned S ubjects  
Approximately 124 subjects are planned to be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_993868] satisfy all the following criteria:  
1. Subject has read and voluntarily signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) after all 
questions have been answered and prior to any study- mandated procedure.  
2. Adult aged 18- 65 years inclusive  at Screening . 
3. Documented medical history consiste nt with acquired, adult onset, sensorineural hearing 
loss associated with noise -induced SNHL (NIHL) or idiopathic sudden SNHL  (SSNHL)  
(documented audiogram at least 6 months prior to screening required).  
4. A pure tone average at the Screening Visit of 35- [ADDRESS_993869] be of non- childbe aring potential or will need to utilize two methods 
of highly effective contraception during the study participation (e.g. hormonal 
contraception and condom or an intrauterine device and condom) or remain abstinent.  Male subjects should use condoms with s permicide during the course of the study or 
remain abstinent.  Subjects should not donate sperm or ova during the study period. 
7. Have met additional masked criteria as determined by [CONTACT_30004] . 
10.5.3 Exclusion C riteria  
Subjects will be excluded from the study if one or more of the following criteria are applicable:  
1. Subject has previously been  randomized in a FX -[ADDRESS_993870] has had an intratympanic injection in either ear within 3 months of the screening 
visit.  
6. Evidence of or previous diagnosis of auditory neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, “central” hearing loss, or genetic hearing loss .  
7. History of chronic, recurrent clinically significant vestibular symptoms . 
8. History of Bilateral S udden Sensorineural Hearing Loss  or R ecurrent S udden 
Sensorineural  Hearing L oss. 
9. History of clinically significant systemic autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’ s syndrome, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis). 
10. History of head or neck radiation, treatment, or exposure to platinum based chemotherapy drugs or aminoglycosides. 
11. Exposure to another investigational drug within [ADDRESS_993871] in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_266115] a detailed medical history, physical examination, and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature).  
13. Positive urine pregnancy test or breast -feeding.  
14. Any known factor, condition, or disease that, in the view of the Investigator, might interfere with treatment compliance, stu dy conduct or interpretation of the results . 
 
 
10.5.4 Withdrawal of  Subjects From Study Assessments  
Subjects may  withdraw from the study fo r any of the following reasons:  
• Adverse Event  
• Deat h 
• Lack of Efficacy  
 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 30 of 64  
 • Lost to Follow -up 
• Other  
• Physician Decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Progressive Disease  
• Protocol Violation  
• Recovery  
• Study Terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Technical Problem  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_727662](s) for withdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment . Should a subject withdraw early from 
the study t he reason(s) for study withdrawal will be documented on the case report form 
(CRF).   All reasonable efforts will be made to have the subject return for one final 
assessment. Subjects withdrawing fr om the study will be encouraged to complete the same 
final evaluations as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations . The aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who completed 
the study. 
Pregnanc y 
Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study, in 
subjects or female partners of male subjects, should be confirmed and reported to the investigator .  All subjects will be followed until the end of the study, completing study 
assessments as appropriate during pregnancy. The I nvestigator should also be notified of 
pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the 
event that a subject is subsequently found to be pregnant after  inclusion in the study, any 
pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to the sponsor after delivery.  
Full details will be recorded on the pregnancy  page of the CRF  at the conclusion of the 
pregnancy.  
Non- childbearing potential:  
Subjects that are deemed non -childbearing potential should have documented hysterectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation, or be  in menopause (no menstrual cycle for 
at least a year).  
10.5.5 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not subsequently randomly assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes inf ormed consent, demography, and  screen failure details . 
 
Rescreening may be permitted in the FX -322-208 study with sponsor approval.

Normative studies were performed by [CONTACT_727668]., (1984). The W -[ADDRESS_993884] was devised by [CONTACT_727669]. (1952). W -[ADDRESS_993885] recognition will be performed at Visit 1, Visit 2 , Visit 3 , Visit 4 , Visit 5 , 
Visit 6 , Visit 7, and Visit 8.  For Visit 1 , testing w ill be performed at 30dB SL regarding the 
pure tone average of 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz at Screening/Visit 1 . For Visit 2 and all subsequent 
visits  (Visits 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8)  testing will be performed at 30dB SL regarding the pure tone 
average of 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz at Visit 2 . If 30dB SL is at an uncomfortable listening level for 
the participant, testing will be performed at the participant’s most comfortable listening level. Word lists will be rotated at each visit. Audio recordings of subject  responses  during 
audiologic testing will be reviewed by a surveillance team for quality assurance. Additional details can be found in the Audiology Manual of Procedures.   
13.1.2 Words -In-Noise Testing (WIN)  
The Words -in-Noise Test (WIN) , using the NU -[ADDRESS_993886] , was developed as an instrument to 
quantify the ability of  listeners to understand monosyllabic words in background noise using 
multitalker babble  (Wilson, 2003). Materials are recorded at 7 signal -to-noise ratios (0, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24 dB)  that are presented  in a descending manner. This test is conducted by 
[CONTACT_1601] [ADDRESS_993887]’s threshold for hearing at various frequencies and will be performed at Visit [ADDRESS_993888].  The following frequencies will be obtained:  Air: 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 3000 Hz, 4000 Hz, 6000 Hz, and 8000 Hz; Bone:  [ADDRESS_993889]’s threshold for 
hearing at frequencies beyond those in standard pure tone audiometry and will be performed at Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit [ADDRESS_993890]. The following frequencies will be obtained: Air: [ADDRESS_993891] listed center frequency (e.g., [ZIP_CODE] Hz may be used for [ZIP_CODE] Hz; [ZIP_CODE] Hz may be used for [ZIP_CODE] Hz). Audio recordings of subject responses during audiologic testing wi ll be reviewed by a surveillance team for quality assurance.  Additional 
details can be found in the Audiology Manual of Procedures.  
 
13.1.5 Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)  
The Tinnitus Functional Index (Meikle et al 2012) has eight subscales that address the 
intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep 
disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress.  The subject will report answers to each of the [ADDRESS_993892] of their hearing loss on daily activities since they were administered the study medication. The scale will be given to all subjects to complete at Visit 6 .  

 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 41 of 64  
 13.2 Safety Measurements Assessed  
13.2.1 Tympanometry  
Tympanometry (an objective test of tympanic membrane mobility) tests the integrity of the 
tympanic membrane by [CONTACT_266140]. Middle ear compliance, peak pressure, and tympanogram type will be recorded.  Tympanometry will be perform ed Visit 1, 
Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit [ADDRESS_993893] on a calibrated tympanometer.  A print -out containing the tympanometry 
from the machine will be collected and stored in the source document.   
13.2.2 Concomitant Medication  
Subjects will be asked about concomitant medications at time points outlined in the Schedule  
of Assessments.  All concomitant medication information will be recorded on the CRF.  
13.2.3  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (temperature,  blood pressure and heart rate) will be recorded at time points 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments and will be performed in a standardized manner, i.e., after the subject has rested for at least 5 minutes.  
 13.2.4  Physical Exam (PE)  
A complete physical exam ination will be performed by a licensed provider at Visit 1 . 
Complete physical examinations include: general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, 
dentition, thyroid, chest (heart, lungs), abdomen, skin, neurological, extremities, back, neck, 
musculoskeletal, and lymph nodes and any pertinent system based on any prior findings. 
Physical examinations may be performed at various unscheduled time points, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737]. 
13.2.[ADDRESS_993894] any abnormalities of the 
external ear canal, tympanic membrane and middle ear and will be performed at Visit 1 , Visit 
3, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6 , Visit 7, and Visit 8 . 
13.2.6   Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
This scale is used to det ermine if any suicide ideation or intention is present  (Posner et al 
2011) .  The questionnaire is read aloud to the subject and responses are recorded by [CONTACT_727670]. If any ideation or intention is present, the Investigator will interview 
the subject and have them follow up with their primary healthcare provider.  The C -SSRS 
will be completed at Visit 3  (Baseline/Screening version), Visit 4 , Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, 
and Visit 8  (Since Last Visit version) . 
13.3 Other Study Assessments  
13.3.1 Speech Reception Threshold (SRT)  
Speech reception threshold is being used as a cross -check measure for the results of pure -tone 
audiometry. The pure tone average (PTA) shall be compared to the SRT to alert the tester to possible concerns about the accuracy of the pure tone results.  
 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 42 of 64  
 13.3.2 Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) Hearing Loss  
This questionnaire is a patient reported outcome measure. The subject will select their 
response to best describe the severity of their hearing loss over the past week. The scale will be given to all subjects to complete at Visit 3 . 
13.3.3 Patient Global Impress ion of Severity (PGI -S) Daily Impacts  
This questionnaire is a patient reported outcome measure. The subject will select their response to best describe the impact of their hearing loss on their daily activities over the past week. The scale will be given t o all subjects to complete at Visit [ADDRESS_993895] a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal  
(investigational) product . This includes an exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, 
intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere on the CRF under spec ific assessments. 
Anticipated fluctuations of pre -existing conditions, including the disease under study that do 
not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. 
AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a nonleading question, for example, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your la st visit?”.  AEs 
will be recorded from the time of study treatment (Visit 3) through the end of the observational  period, or final study visit .  AEs should be reported on the appropriate page of 
the CRF.  
 Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction Definition  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected”  if it is not listed 
in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
“Unexpected,”  as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Assessment of S everity  
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_3470]:  
 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 43 of 64  
 Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort 
and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe : An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.  
If there is a worsening in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate ev ent. 
Assessment of C ausality 
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to 
the study drug. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the following table:  
Not Related : Clinical event with an incompatible time relationship to study 
drug administration, and that could be explained by [CONTACT_727671].  
Unlikely : Clinical event whose time relationship to study drug  
administration makes a causal connection improbable, but that 
could plausibly be explained by [CONTACT_231777].  
Possible : Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug  
administration, but that could also be explained by [CONTACT_64716].  
Related : Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug  
administration and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
Action Taken Regarding Study Drug  
Not Applicable:  Adverse event began after study drug injec tion was complete.  
Dose Not Changed:  An adverse event was experienced at the time of study drug 
injection, but no action was taken with the study drug in relation 
to the specific adverse event.  
Drug Withdrawn:  Study drug injection was stopped permanently in relation to the 
specific adverse event.  
 
FX-322-[ADDRESS_993896]  (Audiometric and Otoscopic)  
If any of the following criteria are met  through Visit 6 (Day 90) , the event will be recorded as 
an adverse event  of special interest  (AESI ) per ASHA guidelines  (ASHA 1994 ): 
• Asymmetric loss of hearing greater than or equal to  20 dB at any one frequency in the 
treated ear  compared to Visit 3 . 
• Asymmetric loss of hearing greater than or equal to  10 dB a t two adjacent fr equencies  
in the treated ear  compared to Visit 3 . 
• Asymmetric  loss of response at three consecutive test frequencies where responses 
were previously obtained  in the treated ear  compared to Visit [ADDRESS_993897] recognition testing, a follow up visit score through Visit 6 (Day 90) in the treated 
ear that falls below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the Visit [ADDRESS_993898] recognition score will be considered an AESI (Carney and Schlauch, 2007).  
Additionally, if the subject experiences a perforation greater than 25% of the tympanic membrane in the treated ear  through Visit 6 (Day 90)  this will be recorded as an AESI .  
If any subjects in the study experience the same AESI  through Visit 6 (Day 90) , the Medical 
Monitor will discuss these with  the Principal Investigator s and each subject’ s condition will 
be discussed .   
 Follow -up of A dverse Events  
All AEs  will be followed until the end of study participation and SAEs  until the event is 
resolved or until, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the event is stabil ized or determined to be 
chronic . Details of AE resolution  must be documented in the CRF. 
Documentation and R eporting of A dverse E vents  
AEs should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined below . 
All AEs occurring during the study (after study treatment has begun)  must be documented on

In addition, medical and scientific judgement is required to decide if prompt notification is required in situations other than those defined for SAEs above. This may include any event that the Investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardized the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may be associated with the use of  the investigational product. 
Reporting of S erious A dverse E vents 
Any SAE must be reported by [CONTACT_727672], whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the investigational product. The Serious Adverse Event CRF must be completed, with as much information as is available, within [ADDRESS_993900] of the study or alter the independent e thics c ommittee ( IEC)/institutional r eview board ( IRB) 
approval/ favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_23748]. In addition the sp onsor will expedite the reporting to 
all concerned Investigators, to the IRBs, where required, and to the regulatory authorities of

FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 46 of 64  
 14.2 Expedited Safety Reporting  
All ser ious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be the subj ect of 
expedited reporting. The sponsor shall ensure that all relevant information about a S[LOCATION_003]R 
that is fatal or life -threatening is reported to the regulatory authorities  and IRB within [ADDRESS_993901] be reported by t he 
investigator to the sponsor. 
15 STATIS TICAL METHODS  
All analyses, data listings, and reports will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
This will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study.  Additional reports and/or analyses will be considered ad -hoc or post -hoc in nature and detailed in the CSR.  
In general, descriptive statistics are defined for continuous variables as the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum; and as count  and 
percentage for categorical variables . 
  15.1 Sample Size 
The sample size of 112 evalu able subjects, in a 1:[ADDRESS_993902] 80% to detect a difference in 
the primary endpoint  for word recognition. The target enrolment of 124 subjects is an 
adjustment for an assumed 10% study dropout rate. 
 15.2 Analysis Sets  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
The Full Analysis Set is defined as all randomized subjects who receive one dose of study 
drug (regardless of whether a full dose was administered) in the qualified ear .  Subjects will 
be analysed according to their randomized treatment group.  The FAS will be the primary analysis set  for all efficacy  endpoints .   
 
• Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS)  
The Per Protocol Analysis Set is defined as all randomized subjects  receiv ing one full dose of 
study drug in the qualified ear, treated per the randomization treatment schedule, and without 
major protocol deviations that could interfere with interpretation of the results.  If different from the FAS, the PPAS may be used in addit ional sensitivity analyses.   Details will be 
provided in the SAP. 
 
• Safety Analysis Set (SfAS)  
 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 47 of 64  
 The Safety Analysis Set (SfAS) will include all subjects who receive one dose of study drug 
(regardless of whether a full dose was administered) in any ear and wi ll be analyzed 
according to the actual treatment group regardless of their randomized treatment assignment.  For safety assessments completed by [CONTACT_727673], actual treated and actual untreated ears will be summarized separately.  The SfAS will be used for the analysis of safety.             
 15.[ADDRESS_993903] an interim analysis  for the potential purposes of 
sample re- estimation and/or futility. Should the sponsor choose to utilize  this option, the 
protocol and SAP would each be prospectively amended. If an interim analysis is to be conducted, the sponsor intends to keep it blinded to an independent Data Monitoring Committee, as well as to Frequency . If an interim analyses is conduc ted, there would be 
prespecified criteria around sample size re -estimation based on pooled variance estimates, as 
well as futility analysis.   
15.[ADDRESS_993904] either completed follow -up 
visits or early discontinue d from study. Primary analysis will be performed in a n unblinded 
fashion for analysis purpose while s ubjects not completing observation visits will continue to 
be followed as being blinded to  treatment assignment .  
Efficacy endpoi nts will be summarized descriptively at each study timepoint.  Calculations 
will include the observed data at each timepoint, and if relevant, the change from baseline (baseline defined as the average across the pre -treatment timepoints).   
For continuous endpoints means, medians, standard deviations, minimums and maximum will be provided.  For categorical endpoints the number and percent of subjects within each category will be calculated.  For descriptive analyses, subjects with missing data will be exclu ded for a particular calculation.  
Inferential statistical methods examining continuous endpoints will be examined via a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM).  Inferential analyses for categorical endpoints will be analysed using univariate methods and/ or Generalized Estimating Equations  (GEEs) (or 
appropriate longitudinal methods as detailed in the SAP) .  When appropriate, models will 
include adjustments for baseline as well as the stratification factors used at randomization  and 
clinically relevant con founders as identified in the SAP .  Departures of these models from the 
statistical assumptions will be assessed and alternative approaches may  be employed.   
 
FX-322-208 V3.0 05Jan2022                                                                            Page 48 of 64  
 Efficacy endpoints will be analysed using the FAS , and complete details of these analyses 
will be  included in the SAP.  
15.6 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be evaluated using the safety analysis set and will include the incidence of 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).  Additionally, descriptive statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_727674], pregnancy tests,  concomitant 
medications, otology, questionnaire responses, and tympanometry and otoscopic assessments.   
15.6.1  Adverse Events  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting adverse events (AEs) will be summarized via the MedDRA system by [CONTACT_266143].  Data will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_926], physician assessment of relationship to study drug, serious AEs, and AEs leading to death or study withdrawal.  Adverse events of the ear and AESIs will include summaries by 
[CONTACT_266144]. non- treated ear.  
 15.6.2  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  The incidence of subjects using concomitant medications will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6977] (ATC), preferred term , and dosing group.  
Prior medications will exclusively be displayed in line listings.  
 Concomitant medications are defined as all medications that started on or after the administration of study drug, or were ongoing at the time of study drug administration.  Prior medic ations are all recorded medications that started and stopped prior to administration of 
study drug.  In the event that a subject begins a previously ended medication (prior medication) following dose of study drug, the post -dose use will be considered conc omitant 
while the prior use will still be reported.   
 15.[ADDRESS_993905] Withdrawals  
With the exception of partial dates to assess AEs and concomitant medications, safety data will not be imputed.  In general, safety endpoints will not be imputed and missing FAS analysis data will be excluded (outside of model -specific, required assumptions).  Details and 
any exceptions will be provided in the SAP.   16 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL

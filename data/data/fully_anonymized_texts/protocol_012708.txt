Brief protocol description  and stu dy design  
This protocol concerns the adaptation,  efficacy- testing  and implementation evaluation of a multi -component 
service delivery model (Link2CARE) that aims to increase HIV/STI testing and substance use (SU) screening; 
reduce HIV and SU risk; and increase linkage to HIV, STI and SU services in justice involved youth (JIY) who 
are enrolled in an alternative sentencing program (Brooklyn Justice Initiatives; BJI). We propose to adapt and 
integrate the following evidence- based strategies to create Link2CARE: (i) Screening: Offer an onsite rapid 
oral HIV test and STI urine test at intake into BJI and screen HIV risk behavior and SU ; (ii) Brief intervention : 
use brief interventions (1- 2 sessions) to reduce HIV risk and SU behavior and promote treatment/service 
readiness (MOVE1 and NYSBIRT2,3); (iii) Linkage to HIV and SU care: use a strengths -based patient 
navigator approach to mobilize  JIY strengths and reduce barriers to treatment , while establishing formal 
relationships and referral protocols with service providers.  We have initiated a partnership with BJI, which 
serves [ADDRESS_174150] STAY, a youth- focused, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - and community -based, health and HIV 
treatment program; Project STAY HIV testing outreach workers will be embedded into BJI  to deliver 
Link2CARE.  We will test the efficacy of Link2CARE in a  randomized controlled trial  among N=450 BJI -enrolled 
JIY (18 -24 y.o.), randomized to either Link2CARE or standard of care (SOC) and conduct implementation 
evaluation to explore individual -, staff, and system -level influences on implementation of this new model to 
inform scale -up and dissemination.  Youth will be assessed at baseline and 3- , 6-, and 12- months post -
intervention.   BJI and Project STAY staff will be assessed before launch of Link2CARE and 12 and 24 months 
later.   
  
Study aims and primary and secondary outcomes 
The study has three aims.  
1. Among 450 (18- 24 y.o) JIY in BJI randomized to either Link2CARE or standard of care (SOC), to 
determine the efficacy of Link2CARE  delivered by [CONTACT_151123] (a) HIV outcomes : 
HIV testing/repeat testing; HIV risk behaviors;  (b) STI outcomes : STI testing/repeat testing; linkage to care 
of JIY with STIs; (c)  SU outcomes : SU screening; SU; linkage to care of JIY with SU/D; and (d) 
(exploratory)  linkage to care of HIV+ youth and linkage to PrEP for (behaviorally) eligible HIV – youth.   
 
2. To determine the influence of theoretically- based mechanisms of change of Link2CARE  (e.g., 
predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, perceived need, organizational climate; staff attitudes)  on 
the proposed HIV, STI and SU outcomes.  
 
3. To describe Link2CARE implementation and elucidate the system/organizational -, staff -, and youth-
level factors that influence implementation (i.e. acceptability, sustainability, feasibility) of 
Link2CARE in an ASP  to develop a plan for dissemination and scale- up of Link2CARE in [LOCATION_001] City  
 
 
The study has the following primary , secondary, and explora tory outcomes (related to aim 1)    
 
Domain 1 (primary outcomes : HIV outcomes) : (a) total number of unprotected anal and vaginal sex occasions 
in past three months at 12 month FU; (b) acceptance of HIV testing at initial offering (y/n), (c) any HIV 
4 
 testing between 6- month and 12- month FU (y/n).   
 
Domain 2 ( secondary outcomes:  SU outcomes) : (a) frequency of youth substance use in past 30 days at 3- , 6- 
and 12- month FUs; (b) number of youth referred to SU treatment at 3- , 6- and 12- month FUs; at (c) number 
of youth attending intake plus one treatment session at 3- , 6- and 12- month FUs.  
 
Domai n 3 (secondary outcomes:  STI testing outcomes) : a) acceptance of STI testing at initial offering (y/n), (b) 
any STI testing between 6- month and 12- month follow up; (c) number of STI+ youth referred to STI 
treatment at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs; (d) number of  STI+ youth attending ≥1 treatment appointment at 3, 
6, 12 months FUs.  
 
Domain 4 ( exploratory outcomes: HIV/PrEP linkage outcomes) : (a) number of HIV+ youth referred to HIV 
treatment at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs, (b) number of HIV+ youth attending at least one treatment 
appointment at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs;  (c) number of youth behaviorally PrEP eligible referred to 
PrEP/medical care at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs, (b) number of youth behaviorally PrEP eligible attending 
at least one HIV care appointment care at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs.

RIAL MANAGEMENT  
Study/data collection sites  
Data will be collected at Brooklyn Justice Initiative (BJI), run  by [CONTACT_151124].  BJI is an 
alternative sentencing program (ASP)  for JIY processed through Brooklyn Criminal Court.  BJI aims to reduce 
re-offending and increase public safety; promote use of meaningful social services; provide rigorous 
compliance monitoring; and reduce criminal convictions and use of jail.  Located in the Brooklyn Criminal 
Courthouse, BJI serves 9,000 youth/year; almost all (94%) are mandated to BJI for ≤[ADDRESS_174151] been placed in 
BJI (samp le 1), from a sample of HIV testing outreach staff (sample 2) and from staff at BJI (Sample 3) . 
 Sample size and power  
The total sample size of sample 1 will comprise N=472 youth currently enrolled at BJI : n=14 youth will serve 
on an advisory panel to provide feedback as MOVE and NYSBIRT are adapted; n =[ADDRESS_174152] of Link2CARE ; and n =450 youth will be randomly 
assigned (1:1) to either Link2CARE or standard of care.  Sample 2 will comprise N =[ADDRESS_174153] STAY 
outreach workers who will be embedded at BJI and will deliver all elements of Link2CARE to youth.  
Sample 3 sample size is expected to be all 15 staff who work at BJI.  
 
Based on our previous work, the retention rate for studies of JYI was about 75% to 80%. Even though we 
anticipate being able to maintain 20% attrition,  we conservatively use 25% attrition at 12- month FU in this power 
calculation.  Under such assumptions and with a baseline sample of [ADDRESS_174154] n=338 with complete data for the primary analysis at 12- month FU.  With 169 participants 
per group and the use of Bonferroni correction, we will be able to provide 80% power to detect a s ta ndardized 
effect size of .35 or more on any of the three primary outcomes (i.e., total number of unprotected anal and 
vaginal sex occasions in past three months, acceptance of HIV testing at initial offering; and frequency of 
substance use in past 30 day s). The standardized effect size of .[ADDRESS_174155] size –  e.g. to reduce the standardized effect 
size from .35 to .32, 100 more participants (22% increase in current sample size) would be required.  Even if 
actual attrition is greater than expected e.g. say 30%, the detectable standardized effect size will only increase 
slightly to .36.  Furthermore, as we will impute missing data using informative covariates for the prima ry 
analyses and using a less conservative Holm procedure for multiple comparison adjustment, power to detect 
such effects will actually be greater than 80%.

ATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS  
Data acquisition , entry  and transmission  
Study data will be collected in Phases 1 and 2. All Phase 1  and all baseline assessments  (Phase 2)  will be 
collected at BJI .  Subsequent Phase 2 assessments will occur at BJI, in the participant’s home or at another 
agreed upon location.   Note: BJI is not involved in survey administration, data entry and management, or data 
storage.    
Phase 1:  Advisory Panel data : Peer (n=14) and Staff (n=6)  Advisory P anels will meet in a series of Panel 
workgroups during Phase 1 to provide feedback on the adaption of the SU and HIV interventions. Data from these Panel workgroups will be gathered in note form by [CONTACT_151125].  These data will be transcribed by [CONTACT_151126] t o inform  adapt ation of  interventions.    
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]:  n=[ADDRESS_174157] -
trained research assistants  (RAs) . These research assistants will bring completed questionnaires to the 
research offices at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151095]. These data will be entered in an electronic database 
by [CONTACT_151127] -trained research assistants. This database will be stored on password- protected computers 
in encrypted files. Researchers will  retain the pi[INVESTIGATOR_151096].

 Phase 2:  Substance use and HIV behavioral risk screen.  Following randomization and baseline 
assessments, n=[ADDRESS_174158] at BJI in private rooms or other agreed upon location (for follow -up 
survey assessments). Data will be cap tured on encrypted, password protected computers, entered directly 
by [CONTACT_151128] -trained RA’s into CiW using Sawtooth Software . Sawtooth Software allows for all 
standard question types, skip patterns, and data pi[INVESTIGATOR_151097].  Web-based data collection will not  be used.  
Following interview completion, RAs will then transport interview data to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151098], and immediately upload it upon return into the master database at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151099] a 
secure server.    
HIV and STI testing:  Following randomization and baseline assessment, all youth will be offered an HIV 
and an STI test for Chlamydia and gonorrhea; initial testing will take place onsite at BJI. All youth will also be 
offered HIV and STI testing at each follow -up interview (3m, 6m and 12m).  HIV testing  will be done using 
Oraquick advance  rapid HIV test.  Following brief pre- test counseling, a n oral swab will be used to collect 
saliva to conduct HIV rapid test .  Once conducted, the embedded Project STAY staff member (LINK2CARE 
condition) or human subjects -trained RA (standard of care) will provide results to the participant and HIV+ JIY 
will be immediately linked to care following Link2CARE linkage protocols. The Project STAY staff or RA will then place the swab in a cl osed Developer Solution vial, then back into the package. The entire package will 
be placed in a baggie.  The baggie with the used test will be brought back to NYSPI  [INVESTIGATOR_151100]- subjects trained 
RAs and turned in to the Project Director  who will enter the res ults into a the project database at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151101] a secure server .  The baggie containing the used OraQuick test and materials will then be disposed of 
in the appropriate waste container.  Staff (interviewers and office staff) will wear gloves when manipulating test materials.   STI testing will occur by [CONTACT_151129] u sing a Gen -probe 
APTIMA Urine Specimen Collection Kit for Male and Female Urine Specimens.  The testing kits are provided 
and the urinalysis will be performed by [CONTACT_151130] (NYCDOH) at no cost as part 
of an ongoing agreement with Project STAY. The client is instructed about how to provide the urine sample, 
and is sent to the bathroom by [CONTACT_151131] (LINK2CARE condition) or 
human subjects -trained RA (standard of care) . Upon return, the Project STAY staff member or RA packages 
the sample and arranges for pi[INVESTIGATOR_151102]'s (DOH) Bureau of STD control. NYCDOH 
uses the third generation nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), yielding qualitative testing results. Specimens 
will be collected and transferred into their respective specimen transport tubes. The transport solutions in these tubes release the rRNA targets  and protect them from degradation during storage. When the APTIMA Combo 
[ADDRESS_174159] and GC labeled probes 
allow for the differentiation of signal; kinetic profiles are derived from measurements of photon output during the detection read time. The chemiluminescent detection reaction for CT signal has very rapid kinetics and has the “flasher” kinetic type, while the detection reaction for GC signal is relatively slower and has the “glower” 
kinetic type. Assay results are determined by a cut -off based on the total RLU and the kinetic curve type.   
Written documentation of the test results will be obtained by [CONTACT_151132] [ADDRESS_174160] positive will be contact[CONTACT_151133] a succession of methods (telephone, registered letter, and, if refused or undelivered, regular mail). Participants will be informed that antibiotics are used to trea t 
Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. We will counsel that all sex partners within the last [ADDRESS_174161] baseline with n=[ADDRESS_174162] at BJI in private 
rooms or other agreed upon location (for follow -up survey assessments). Data will be captured on encrypted, 
[ADDRESS_174163] s-trained RA’s into CiW using Sawtooth 
Software . Sawtooth Software  allows for all standard question types, skip patterns, and data pi[INVESTIGATOR_151097].  Web-
based data collection will not  be used.  Following inter view completion, RAs will then  transport  interview data  
to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151098] , and immediately upload it upon return into the 
master database at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151099] a secure server.    
Face -to-face survey interviews  - staff. Phase 2 staff survey interviews will be completed pre-
implementation of Link2CARE, at 12m (during implementation of Link2CARE and at 24m (post -
implementation of Link2CARE)  with n= 15 BJI staff and n=[ADDRESS_174164] protected computers, 
entered directly by [CONTACT_151128] -trained RA’s in to CiW using Sawtooth Software . Sawtooth Software 
allows for all standard question types, skip patterns, and data pi[INVESTIGATOR_151097].  Web-based data collection will not  be 
used.  Following interview completion, RAs will then transport interview data to NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151098], and immediately upload it upon return into the master database at NYSPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_151099] a secure server.  
Post-implementation focus group.  Project STAY and BJI staff will participate in a one -time focus 
group following the implementation of Link2CARE, which will take place in a private room at BJI . The focus 
group will be digitally recor ded, transported by [CONTACT_151134] a locked pouch bac k to NYSPI  [INVESTIGATOR_151103] a 
secure server at NYSPI. The recordings will then be transcribed for analysis .  These recordings will be 
retained until the completion of all project activities in Year Five when they will be destroyed following 
HIPAA standard  document destruction services.  
 Data analysis plan  
Intent -to-treat principles will be invoked in the primary analysis. The primary aim  is to determine whether 
participants randomized to Link2CARE show greater improvement in HIV outcomes from baseline to 12-month follow up than participants in SOC.  Measurement of primary HIV outcomes includes three variables: 
number of unprotected sex oc casions, whether participants accept HIV testing at initial offering (y/n), and 
any (repeat) HIV testing between 6- month and 12- month follow up (y/n).  Other behavioral and linkage 
variables to be examined as secondary and exploratory outcomes are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Implementation outcomes to be examined include feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability.  In addition, we 
will examine potential CFIR correlates of implementation, such as organization culture and climate and staff 
attitudes.  Finally, mediators associated with service use as specified by [CONTACT_151135], including motivation for treatment, perceived barriers to treatment, prior service utilization.  
 Analysis plan for Specific Aim  1.  Prior to conducting our multivariable analyses, w e will examine study 
variables using descriptive statistics, testing for differences across demographic characteristics (e.g., 
race/ethnicity, age) using t -tests, ANOVAs, and Chi -squares, as appropriate.  Systematic  baseline differences 
are not expected; however, any parameters that differ across conditions at baseline will be included as covariates 
in subsequent models.    We will calculate descriptive summary statistics corresponding to study variables at each 
follow-up (FU) to understand any temporal patterns, as well as compare the two groups in terms of average 
change from baseline to 12- months post -baseline.  We will use the general framework of generalized linear 
models (GLM) to model the longitudinal outcome tr ajectories and GEE method to account for within- subject 
correlation across the four time points (baseline, 3- , 6-, and 12- months) .  Stratified randomization of 
participants to the groups based on their gender requires that the analysis also include gender as covariate.  
The general form of t he analysis model will be g(μ)=α 0+α1X+βI+∑γ iTi+∑δ iTiI, where g  denotes the link function 
(identity for continuous outcome, logit for binary outcome and natural log for count outcomes) X represents the indicator of female (vs. male), I is the group indicator for Link2CARE (vs. SOC), and T
i is the indicator for time 
at 3-month, 6- month, and 12- month evaluation (vs. baseline) for i=1, 2, and 3.  The interaction coefficients δi 
are of interest, measuring the difference in the  rate of change in outcome across the two treatment groups at 
each follow -up assessment.  We will employ the above analytic approach to examine differences between youth 
in Link2CARE and in the SOC condition with respect to key study parameters within thes e four domains  detailed 
below. Proposed hypotheses  are that the experimental arm (Link2CARE) would have better outcomes (e.g. 
greater reduction on total number of unprotected anal and vaginal sex occasions in past three months from 
baseline to 12 month FU; greater increase in proportion of acceptance of HIV testing at initial offering; greater 
reduction on frequency of substance use in past 30 days at 3- , 6- and 12- month FUs; and of those referred to SU 
treatment, a greater  number of youth attending intake plus one treatment session at 3- , 6- a nd 12- month FUs)  
[ADDRESS_174165] of care; all hypothesis tests will be conducted under the control of fam ilywise error 
rate no greater than 0.[ADDRESS_174166] for multiple 
comparisons.  
1. Domain 1 (primary outcomes : HIV outcomes) : (a) total number of unprotected anal and vaginal sex 
occasions in past three months at 12 month FU; (b) acceptance of HIV testing at initial offering (y/n), (c) 
any HIV testing between 6- month and 12- month FU (y/n).   
2. Domain 2 (SU outcomes) : (a) frequency of youth s ubstance use in past 30 days at 3- , 6- and 12- month 
FUs; (b) number of youth referred to SU treatment at 3- , 6- and 12- month FUs; at (c) number of youth 
attending intake plus one treatment session at 3- , 6- and 12- month FUs.  
3. Domain 3 ( exploratory outcomes : HIV/PrEP linkage outcomes) : (a) number of HIV+ youth referred to 
HIV treatment at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs, (b) number of HIV+ youth attending at least one treatment appointment at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs;  (c) number of youth behaviorally PrEP eligible ref erred to 
PrEP/medical care at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs, (b) number of youth behaviorally PrEP eligible 
attending at least one HIV care appointment care at 3, 6, and 12 months FUs.  
4. Domain 4 (STI testing outcomes) : a) acceptance of STI testing at initial offering (y/n), (b) any STI testing 
between 6- month and 12- month follow up; (c) number of STI+ youth referred to STI treatment at 3, 6, 
and 12 months FUs; (d) number of STI+ youth attending ≥1 treatment appointment at 3, 6, 12 months 
FUs.  
 
 Analysis plan for Specific Aims 2 and 3 .  Descriptive statistics will be computed to quantify implementa tion 
at every step, by [CONTACT_151136].  Thus, we will be able to compute uptake of LINK2CARE, 
dose/intensity of intervention received, number of providers delivering each intervention, and other implementation parameters.  Of note for  Aim 2, which seeks to examine the proposed mechanisms of change 
of the intervention on HIV, STI and substance use outcomes, a given outcome (e.g. HIV/STI testing uptake, or 
PrEP uptake or reduced substance use) of this analysis will only be examined among those for whom it is 
relevant.  For example, if a youth does not meet criteria for PreP and as such is not offered PrEP, we would 
not include this youth in analyses of mechanisms of change of Link2CARE as they influence substance use or 
PrEP uptake as an outcome.  W e will examine the changes in specific outcomes (e.g. sexual behavior post -
intervention) as a function of proposed theory -based intervention mediators (e.g. predisposing characteristics, 
enabling resources, perceived need for treatment/services) .  We will use structural equation models for these 
analyses.  Structural equation modeling is preferred to multiple regression techniques because of the potential measurement error in our mediating variables and because of the possible feedback between depe ndent and mediating variables.  We will test the model described in Figure 1 in the application, entering intervention 
condition as exogenous variables and the mediating factors included in Figure 1 as endogenous variables.  
Prior to conducting the struc tural analyses, however, we will examine the effects of the intervention on the 
putative mediating variables; a condition for inclusion in the equation will be a significant intervention effect on 
the potential mediators. Using standardized path coefficients, we will examine the relative associations of 
mediators to behavior change.  We will also examine the path coefficient for the direct effect of the intervention 
after removing the effects of mediating constructs.  For example, Link2CARE may have a more positive effect on 
acceptance of HIV (and STI) testing among JIY with greater perceived HIV risk, greater motivation to receive services, or positive HIV -testing history.  Similarly, Link2CARE may have more positive effect on linkage 
outcomes when operating in an ASP that is more supportive of concepts perceived as innovative by [CONTACT_151137].  Here, organizational culture would appear to modify Link2CARE’s impact on youth service referral and engagement outcomes.  We will examine the Lagrange Mult iplier and Wald Tests to consider the deletion or 
inclusion of paths
5; ultimately, however, deletion or inclusion of paths will be informed by [CONTACT_151138][INVESTIGATOR_11423].  Once the model is identified, we will test for group differences between intervention conditions in 
latent constructs and in the proposed paths between these constructs.  This method will allow us to estimate the 
intervention effects on the constructs directly as well as their relationships to one another.6  We will use three 
goodness -of-fit indices: Bentler -Bonnet’s Normed Fit Index, Bentler -Bonnet’s Non- Normed Fit Index, and the 
Comparative Fit Index.  We will also verify the root mean- square error of approximation (RMSEA) as an index of 
misfit . Well -fitting models will have fit indices of.90 or higher and <.06 for RMSEA.  
Analysis of participant attrition and missing data .  We will make every effort to retain participants in the 
study to avoid bias due to attrition.  For those individua ls who refuse continued participation, we will document 
reasons for study discontinuation and Rubin’s multiple imputation method with [ADDRESS_174167] missing data to be minimal, nevertheless regular 
(quarterly) quality assurance checks will be made by [CONTACT_151139].  
 
Procedures to guarantee the accuracy and completeness of the data, during data collection, entry, 
transmission, and analysis.  
To check for errors in data entry, we will adhere to the following protocol.  All face- to-face surveys will be 
recorded.  One out of every seve n recordings for each interviewer will be compared to the entered interview.  If 
we identify a proportion of errors that is more than 1% error, we will temporarily suspend the interviewer  from 
active interviewing.  We will liste n to all interviews for comparison purposes, identifying any errors and will re -
train the interviewer to ensure accuracy and completeness of all face- to-face survey interviews. A subset 
(10%) of all data from hard- copy/paper -pencil instruments that is entered into the project database will be 
similarly  checked .  If we identify a proportion of errors that is more than 1% error, we will reenter all 
questionnaires and subsequently compare both data sets. We will go back to the original surveys to resolve all 
inconsistencies. To prevent data entry problems we will prepare a data entry system that will alert us when 
data are entered that are out of range.  
 
Procedures for preventing and addressing breaches of confidentiality  
Above we described how data are protected during collection and transportation. Once at NYSPI, a ll data will 
be saved on secure, password- protected servers. The information gathered will be used only for scientific, 
educational, or instructional purposes.  All interviewers and all other study staff are trained on the importance 
of subject confidentiality.

EGULATORY ISSUES  
Procedures for research team management of AEs, SAEs and other study risks such as mandatory 
reporting requirements (e.g., child abu se, infectious disease, etc.)  
The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_151147] has the ultimate responsibility for reviewing conduct of the study and 
data produced from it, including the reporting of any adverse events to the respective IRBs.  
 AEs and SAE that c ome to the attention of any staff person involved in the study, have to be reported 
directly to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_151104] . If no action has yet been taken, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_151105], [CONTACT_151148] or one of the Project STAY 
staff at BJI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_151106], in line with the seriousness of 
the event.  And follows NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_151107] (S)AEs and receives feedback about appropriat e course of 
action to follow.  Below is a table of potential AEs and SAEs and the proposed procedures to detect them.    
 Procedures to prevent the violation of confidentiality in accordance with reporting requirements are 
limited by [CONTACT_151140]. Therefore, all subjects are informed in the consent 
document that the only times other people will find out what they said during the study are: (1) If they describe 
the physically or sexually abusing a child. This will be reported to the [LOCATION_001] State Central Registry (NSCR) 
which takes calls for child abuse and neglect allegations. If accepted, the NSCR will forward to Bronx field office for the City’s Administration for Children’s Services (ACS). (2) If they say they want to harm t hemselves 
or another person, the researchers can break confidentiality to refer them for further evaluation. (3) In cases of a positive HIV or STI diagnosis, we will follow standard procedures, in line with legal requirements. The mandate for HIV is for the provider doing posttest counseling is to assess for partner notification within [ADDRESS_174168] option is to inform 
the [LOCATION_001] City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), which does anonymous  notification 
and advices sexual partners to go to their physician and get tested. The assessment for partner notification 
includes a check for domestic abuse risk. For other STIs, partner notification is voluntary not mandatory but 
Project STAY staff will  assess for partner notification and ask the patient to notify partners themselves, the 
patient can bring partner in, DOHMH can assign a field worker for anonymous notification; Project STAY staff 
will never call the partner down. All STI, including Chlamy dia, Gonorrhea and HIV require an individual, 
identified report to the city as they occur; this is a direct online report into the DOHMH website.

Staff training (including NIH -required human subjects training and other related training)  
All staff involved in the study (researchers, clinic staff, the Implementation Coach, the Youth Outreach Worker) has successfully completed a mandatory, training/testing program on human subject protection; staff is required to keep their ethics certification up to date. In addition, clinic staff are trained in issues related to 
ethnic and cultural diversity and to concerns and needs of the adolescents they will interview and in 
procedures for addressing any problems that may arise. Furthermore, research and program staff are trained 
to identify events that would fall under mandatory reporting guidelines, to respond to distress and in emergency procedures that are activated if an adolescent admits to thoughts of harming himself or others. The Program furthermore contains specific training activities to ensure skillful im plementation of activities in line with ethical 
guidelines, e.g., Peer Navigators will be thoroughly trained on the imperative of confidentiality and other ethical 
aspects of being a peer navigator.  
 
Certificate of confidentiality  
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from NIH to protect the privacy of our research subjects by 
[CONTACT_151141] a research project.  
 Procedures and timeline for reporting AEs and SAEs to NIDA  
Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported to the NIDA PO at least once per year as part of the annual progress 
report.  This report will describe the event, when it occurred, the study arm of the participant, and the 
outcome/resolution.  If there were no AEs, we will include a statement in the progress report that no AEs 
occurred.   In case of SAEs, the contact [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_151109] [ADDRESS_174170] and receive permission from the PO for protocol or DSMP 
changes in advance of their implementation.  
 
Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] R ules 
Only two of the three co- primary endpoints will be monitored for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : (1) total number of unprotected 
anal and vaginal sex occasions in past three months at 12 month FU; (2) any HIV testing between 6- month 
and 12- month FU (y/n).  We will follow a  modified Haybittle -Peto rule
7  to propose early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151110]: the 
z-score for testing the null hypothesis for each of the two primary outcomes will be calculated once during 
interim analyses (see below) when one- quarter of the expected total 12- month outcome data has been 
observed (after approximately 6- months of 12- month data collection).  This will allow the  PSMB to recommend 
continuing to recruit subjects or stop the trial  for strong positive or negative efficacy  prior to the end of subject 
recruitment .   
 
The z -score for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151111] Z  = 3.[ADDRESS_174171] early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151112]- tailed probability 0.0005 under the null hypothesis and therefore the 
probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151113] 0.001.  This stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151114] O’Brien- Fleming -like alpha spending function 
monitoring plan, yet is still sufficiently conservative to leav e the terminal significance criteria nearly unaffected.  
In particular, assuming no early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], if either of the two monitored co- primary endpoints specified above 
possesses the smallest P -value among all three co- primary endpoints, the group comparison will be declared 
significant at the 0.05 level (adjusted for multiple comparisons) if the terminal z -score criterion is Z  = 2.3978 or 
greater.  This Z -score is very close to the nominal 0.05/3 ≈ 0.[ZIP_CODE] two- tailed normal critical value of 2.3940, 
which is the initial required criterion under the Holm step- down procedure without sequential monitoring.  If the 
unmonitored co- primary endpoint ( acceptance of H IV testing at initial offering, y/n)  should have its P -value as 
smallest and less than or equal to 0. 05/3 ≈ 0.[ZIP_CODE], then it will be declared significant (at the two- tailed 0.05 
level, adjusted for multiple comparisons).   
 Assuming no early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151115], 
testing stops under the Holm step- down procedure and none of the three null hypotheses will be rejected.  
Assuming no early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151116], the next step in the Holm step- down procedure will use either the nominal P-value for the unmonitored co- primary 
endpoint (if it has the second smallest P -value) or, if not, the P -value for the monitored endpoint with the 
second smallest P -value adjusted for the interim analysis.   This P-value will again be very close to the nominal 
P-value due to use of the conservative modified Haybittle- Peto stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3106].  The appropriate two-tailed 
P-value must equal 0.05/2 = 0.025 or less to declare significance; if not, testing stops and only t he first 
endpoint result will be reported as significant.  If so, then testing proceeds under the Holm step- down 
procedure to the remaining endpoint with criterion P -value 0.05, unadjusted if for the unmonitored endpoint or 
adjusted for interim monitoring if for one of the monitored endpoints.  If the 0.05 P -value criterion is not 
achieved, only the preceding two endpoints will be declared significant.  If the 0.05 P -value criterion is 
achieved, all three endpoints will be declared significant at the 0.05 l evel (adjusted for multiple comparisons).  
 The analyses on the two primary endpoints will be presented to the PSMB (see Efficacy Data below) in a blinded fashion (i.e. A vs B) with a brief description as to whether or not we meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  Of cou rse, 
the PSMB may request additional information and/or unblinding on a need- to-know basis.  Other reasons for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356], e.g., unexpectedly low recruitment or poor retention, will be considered by [CONTACT_151142]- data reviews  at six -month intervals.  The PSMB has substantial experience with oversight 
of trial integrity issues and will come to a recommendation around stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151117] 
[ADDRESS_174172] are developed for adults and do not take into consideration developmental needs of the youth.  A 
screening, risk reduction and linkage model that addresses organizational and staff level - barriers to linkage 
and engagement, as well as directly targeting youth- level barriers to reducing risk behavior and service uptake 
is critical to providing JIY with skills necessary to navigate multiple systems (substance use treatment, HIV 
care and justice system), remove barriers to service use, enroll in and remain in services.  The fact that rates 
of HIV are elevated in correctional populations compared to the general population, targeting youth who are attending community programs in lieu of jail or detention represents a critical point for intervention.  Moreover, 
substance use/disorder in JIY are much higher t han youth in the general population, and that these youth have 
much worse outcomes associated with substance use but receive services at much lower rates warrants 
immediate attention.  This study will provide an opportunity to improve identification, risk reduction and 
enrollment in care for youth who are at the highest risk of HIV and substance use, yet least likely to receive 
services.  For these reasons, this study has the potential to impact the health and functioning of high- risk 
youth.   Additionally, JIY will be asked specifically for their experience with the operation of Link2CARE in their 
agency and input into how to improve linkage to HIV substance use services for JIY.  Study participants often 
derive a sense of altruism, accomplishment, and contr ibution to furthering understanding of the problem 
through their participation, and past participants in similar studies by [CONTACT_978], co- Is and consultants have 
indicated the process was enjoyable and beneficial.  
 
The importance of Knowledge to be gained  
Prevalence of HIV and substance use disorders among JIY is significantly higher compared to youth in the general population. Ultimately, a study of this kind has the potential to (a) improve the outcomes for youth by 
[CONTACT_151143], infection and probl ematic substance use, reducing risky behaviors and linking high risk 
youth to necessary care and treatment, while overcoming system and youth level -barriers to this process; and 
(b) identify multilevel factors that are associated with adopting and sustaini ng innovative practices.  Risks to 
participation in the study (discussed above in the section 5.2) are reasonable given the importance of 
knowledge expected from the study.   
 
 
T
RIAL EFFICACY  
Responsibility for data and safety monitoring   
The project will use the  Performance and Safety Monitoring Board (PSMB)  of the HIV Center for Clinical and 
Behavioral Studies (P30- MH43520) at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. The HIV Center’s PSMB is an 
external advisory group comprising communit y and clinical psychologists, a biostatistician, an ethicist, and a 
clinician not affiliated with HIV Center research projects or our home institutions. This PSMB has specifically 
been established to deal with studies focused on HIV infection and has the necessary expertise to address urgent issues that might arise in relation to the current protocol and to support us when protocol changes might 
be necessary. This PSMB, coordinated by [CONTACT_151144], Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and Data Management (SED) Core of 
the HIV C enter, monitors intervention projects associated with the Center on a yearly basis. The project will be 
reviewed at least once each year and more often if necessary or to follow up on PSMB recommendations. In addition, we will call on the PSMB as needed to address urgent matters that arise, including SAES/AEs, 
questions and concerns from the IRB, and discussions about possible protocol changes.  
 
Composition of the PSMB  Bette Crigger, Ph.D. (Chair), Director of Ethics, American Medical Association, Chicago, IL.

[ADDRESS_174173] that the HIV Center Director obtains independent 
verification of some or all data relevant to the safety of human research participants and the scientific 
objectives of the trial. Independ ent verification may include examination of relevant medical and research 
records. Under extraordinary circumstances –  for instance, continued failure on the part of an investigator to 
take appropriate measures for the protection of research participants f rom significant risk –  the chair of the 
PSMB, with the agreement of the PSMB, can communicate directly with the Director of the funding agency.  
 Statement of no conflicts of interest 
None of the members of the PSMB has an appointment at our institutions or research collaborations with the 
Principal Investigators or team.   
 
Frequency of meetings  The PSMB typi[INVESTIGATOR_151118]- site at the HIV Center at least once each year to monitor projects and through 
conference calls both among the board members and with the HIV Center leadership and investigators during the year to assure that PSMB recommendations are enacted. Regarding this specific protocol, the PSMB will meet as needed to address any of the above or other urgent or timely sensitive matters that might arise.  
 
Plans for Interim Analysis of efficacy data 
The aim s of early interim analys es (in six -month intervals) are to (a) ensure that assumptions about mission-
critical par ameters ( means, standard deviations, and prevalence of main outcomes) made for purposes of 
power are approximately correct ; and (b)  to monitor safety of the trial participants, reviewing all adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).  Interim analyses for safety and data monitoring of mission critical 
parameters, including recruitment and retention rates, will be conducted every 6 months by [CONTACT_151145] (see Monitoring activities below).   A third aim of interim analysis is (c) 
to check at a strategic point in the trial whether sufficiently strong evidence of positive or negative efficacy has 
accumulated to warrant consideration of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]  (see Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151119]) . For all analyses t he PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_151120].  As far as is feasible, the PSMB will also remain  blinded, 
reviewing interim analyses prepared by [CONTACT_151146] A/B format .  They may, of course, request 
additional information for any safety concerns or risk- benefit analyses on an as -needed basis.  Agreement on 
these procedures will be obtained with the PSMB prior to trial start.  As described above, interim analyses for 
trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151121]- quarter of the 12-month data has been collected.   
 
Monitoring activities  Although the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_151122], including the reporting of any adverse events to the Institutional Review Boards of Columbia 
University/the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) and NIDA, the PSMB will also review this project 
twice each year (every 6 months).  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_69059] a list of adverse outcomes (e.g., significant psychological distress, loss of privacy) that might oc cur as a result of participation in the study.  In 
[ADDRESS_174174] to the PSMB, a blinded report will be sent to the 
PSMB members in the weeks before the meeting and include a 1) a brief description of the trial , 2) summary of 
progress to date, including participant baseline sociodemographic characteristics, 3) blinded data such as participant accrual and retention, prevalence of main outcomes, 4) a description of any AEs or SAEs, and 5) an interim efficacy compa rison when one- quarter of the 12- month primary endpoints have been observed.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this information is reviewed during the open session of the PSMB meeting.  In closed session, the PSMB will review the data in blinded A versus B format (and, if needed, in unblinded fashion) after which, the  
PSMB members will present feedback to the project research team with respect to whether the study should 
be continued.     
 Communication P lan Acknowledgment of Reporting R equirement

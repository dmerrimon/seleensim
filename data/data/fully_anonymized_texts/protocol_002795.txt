1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
 
The majority of patients suffering from stroke have functional motor impairments that negatively affect 
their mobility and daily life activities causing a low overall quality of life (1, 2) . The most effective way to 
reduce these motor deficits is with task -specific rehabilitation training (3-7). Recent studies show that 
noninvasive brain stimulation can enhance task -specific training (8-10). Specifically, repetitive transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can noninvasively modulate the primary motor cortex (11-13). 1Hz rTMS has 
a cortically suppressive effect (14), whereas 10 and 20Hz stimulation paradigms induce cortical 
excitability (11, 12) . Increases in excitability last between 10 -60 minutes depending on the form of 
stimulation. These effects are likely long -term depression (LTD) and long -term potentiation (LTP) like 
neuroplasticity states, as pharmacological NMDA receptor blockade prevent s these TMS -induced 
changes (15). 
rTMS is emerging as a potential rehabilitation tool – when delivered to the motor cortex, rTMS 
can correct post -stroke interhemispheric -imbalance by [CONTACT_377549] 1Hz rTMS (16) or increasing excitability in the ipsilesional motor cortex using 10 and 
20Hz rTMS (17, 18) . Findings from these studies suggest that rTMS may develop into a promising 
adjuvant to conventional motor rehabilitation, however a recent large -scale trial was negative however, 
showing that more work is needed to understand how best to use rTMS for str oke motor recovery.  
Can we enhance the effects of rTMS on motor cortex? A different brain stimulation modality, 
cervically implanted vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS) can enhance neuroplasticity and facilitate 
rehabilitation, especially when paired with an intervention such as t ask-specific training (19, 20) . There is 
a new noninvasive form of this method, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). This 
may also facilitate plasticity and is being investigated in the enhancement of motor learning and recovery 
in a specific paired fashion. The timing of the paired VNS is critical to the desired neuroplastic 
changes (21-23), as the behavioral effects of paired therapy disappear when behavior is not intricately 
synchronized with stimulation. Could pairing taVNS with TMS boost the effects of TMS on cortex, and 
potentially emerge as a stroke recovery tool? As a first step in th is direction, we propose a basic, 
mechanistic pi[INVESTIGATOR_377538]/TMS to further enhance motor cortex 
excitability in 24 healthy individuals in a 4 visit, randomized, sham controlled, counterbalanced study.  
 
Aim 1. Determine the effects of taVNS on motor cortex excitability. We hypothesize that taVNS 
alone (sham rTMS + active taVNS) will induce increases in motor cortex excitability (post -stimulation 
compared to baseline). We believe these changes will be of a lesser magnitude than those of TMS alone 
(active rTMS + sham taVNS)  due to the indirect mechanistic approach of taVNS.  
 
Aim 2. Determine whether taVNS -paired TMS is more effective at inducing cortical excitability 
than TMS alone. We hypothesize that pairing two forms of neuromodulation (active rTMS + active 
taVNS) will increase TMS -induced cortical excitability in the motor cortex when compared to single 
modality approaches (active rTMS + sham taVNS; sham rTMS + active taVNS). Furthermore, we believe 
this increase is timing sensitive, and the paired approach will induce larger TMS -induced cortical 
excitability compared to unpaired neuromodulation (active taVNS + active taVNS).  
 
2.0 Background  
85% of stroke cases result in reductions in motor function, and this has a severe negative impact on daily 
living (1, 2) .  Motor rehabilitation training paradigms, such as task -specific training are common 
interventions to restore function in the affected limbs (3-7). Neuromodulation techniques such as 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are becoming a widely used tool to augment motor training. 
rTMS is most commonly used to modulate cortical excitability in the motor cortex of individuals receiving 
motor rehabil itation training (17, 18)  and is also used to treat a variety of non -motor stroke symptoms 
such as depression (24). rTMS is a promising tool for neurorehabilitation, however its cortical effects are 
transient and behavioral benefits aren’t seen for several weeks. There is a need for noninvasive 
Version 3; Version Date : 6/11/[ADDRESS_472627]. Badran (PI) and the team at the MUSC Brain Stimulation Lab have pi[INVESTIGATOR_214669] a noninvasive form of 
vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) known as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). Our 
group demonstrated taVNS activates the afferent vagal s ystem by [CONTACT_377550] a reliable 
biomarker to determine optimal stimulation parameters. Following the optimization of the parameter 
space, [CONTACT_101228] conducted a novel concurrent taVNS/fMRI study exploring the direct brain effects of 
taVNS whic h revealed activation of the vagal afferent network induced by [CONTACT_377551] (25). 
This taVNS system can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_377539] -VNS, and a small open -label trial of paired taVNS is planned at MUSC later this year.  
The research team is poised to develop a unique, novel, multimodal form of brain stimulation – 
combining both taVNS and TMS in a time dependent, synchronized manner. We plan to develop this 
taVNS/TMS system as Aim 1 of this proposal. Critical to understand ing the faciliatory effects of pairing 
taVNS with TMS is the underlying principle of timing the paired stimulus which be better understood. Aim 
2 explores the timing effects of paired taVNS/TMS in a classic MEP paradigm, which can help elucidate 
whether pa ring of stimulation is critical to the excitability changes. This proposal aims to create a 
concurrent taVNS/TMS system that can administer both paired - and unpaired - taVNS/TMS stimulation to 
the motor cortex and facilitate cortical excitability. We will subsequently use this system to investigate 
whether the timing  of taVNS is critical to inducing motor cortex excitability.  
 
rTMS -induced increases in cortical excitability improve functional outcomes post -stroke  
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, noninvasive form of cortical brain 
stimulation that transiently induces neurophysiologic changes. When delivered at sub -threshold intensity 
to the motor cortex has been used to correct post -stroke interhemispheric -imbalance by [CONTACT_377552]. 
(17, 18) . 
Studies have demonstrated that single sessions of high frequency stimulation (20Hz) of the motor cortex 
elicits transient increases in MEP size. This modulation of cortical excitability makes rTMS an exciting 
tool for motor rehabilitation, as motor cortex excitability is involved in the learning of motor skills (26, 27) . 
rTMS is a safe method of inducing motor cortex excitability and is in neurorehabilitation to either inhibit 
contralesional motor cortex or excite ipsilesional motor cortex in order to restore interhemispheric 
competition post -stroke.  
Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) may facilitate neuroplasticity:  
Cervically implanted vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS) is an invasive form of neuromodulation which has 
been demonstrated to induce broad downstream neuroplastic cellular effects. These effects are driven by 
[CONTACT_377553] (LC) which serves as the main e ntry of the vagus nerve into the central nervous 
system. Lesions to LC inhibit this noradrenergic -driven neuroplasticity (28, 29) . VNS is an influencer of 
neural plasticity when paired with specific behavior  (30-33). 
The auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) is the target of a novel form of noninvasive vagus nerve 
stimulation known as transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS)(11)(14, 16, 29 -34). [CONTACT_377560] (PI) and the team at the MUSC Brain Stimulation Lab have pi[INVESTIGATOR_377540]. As a cost -effective, noninvasive alterative to implantable 
cVNS we believe taVNS can mimic the effects of cVNS and be easily combined to enhance 
neuroplasticity.  
Pairing taVNS with TMS might synergistically increase the effects of TMS alone  
Rat models of VNS -paired therapy have demonstrated that timing is critical to the neuroplastic effects of 
VNS. Rehabilitation training without VNS takes a long time, and VNS alone fails to restore the behavior 
without the paired training. Delivering VNS im mediately following training fails to enhance the training. 
Therefore, it is important to synchronize stimulation precisely with the paired training.  
Version 3; Version Date : 6/11/2020  
 
 Page 4 of 11  Aim 1 of this proposal establishes a computerized system that can synchronize two forms of 
neuromodulation – TMS and taVNS. Using this system, we will investigate whether the  timing of taVNS 
impacts the cortical excitability effects of TMS alone.  
  
3.0 Intervention  to be studied  
We will be using a c ombined  taVNS /TMS  system that will deliver taVNS with TMS  training  in a health y 
population. The rational and overview is described below:   
Pairing taVNS with TMS  
Aim [ADDRESS_472628] and is actively being used in several 
MUSC clinical trials exploring its use as a potential treatment for 
neuropsychiatric disorders. taVNS is also an enhancer of neuroplasticity.  
This study will combine two safe, validated forms of neuromodulation delivered either concurrently 
(paired) or independently (unpaired).  
 
Motor -Evoked Potentials.  
MEP Recordings.  EMG recordings using Ag/Ag Chloride electrodes will be placed on the subject’s hand 
muscle in order to record motor excitability. The EMG recording electrodes will be connected to a 
standard CED (Cambridge Electronics Device) amplifier and pre -amplifier. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]2 software will be used 
to analyze and record the MEPs.   The level of stimulation required to produce a MEP of 1mV will be 
determined prior to collecting baseline MEPs. Baseline MEPs will be collected at the pre -determined 
stimulation o utput for 1mV. Another series of pulses will be analyzed in comparison with the first. If the 
average amplitude is within 25%, we will proceed with experiment. If not, another series of baseline 
pulses will be obtained repeating the above process, up to 4 times. If the baseline remains highly 
variable, the participant will be withdrawn. Following rTMS stimulation, the same pat tern of single pulses 
will be recorded at 0, 10, 20, 30.. 
 
The key assumption that  underlies the use of MEP measurements as a "read -out" of upstream 
processes influencing the motor system is that  the amplitude of MEPs recorded (via EMG) from 
peripheral muscles is a product of top -down influences on M1 (such as att ention/volitional control), 
combined with changes in excitatory/inhibitory pre -synaptic (inter)neuronal balance (i.e. due to rTMS at 
the stimulation  site), and the post -synaptic  excitability of corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_377541] (Bestmann and 
Krakauer, 2015) . This method has been well -established as safe and reliable in the field of TMS research 
and in the brain stimulation laboratory.  
 
Neuronavigation.  Brainsight Neuronavigation equipment and software will be used ( https://www.rogue -
research.com/tms/brainsight -tms/) to help ensure that the stimulation site remains unchanged during and 
between recordings and thereby [CONTACT_377554].

Up to 40 participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and if enrolled, will attend up to 5 
visits at the MUSC brain stimulation laboratory. Participants will sign consent before visit 1, including a 
urine pregnancy screen (if female). We expect this study to be completed over the span of 6 -8 months.

For more information on taVNS and TMS screening please see the uploaded taVNS screening form.  
 
Study Design  
We will enroll 40 healthy individuals into a 
motor excitability prescreening visit (20Hz 
rTMS to motor cortex flanked by [CONTACT_094] - and 
post-MEP), and from this prescreen cohort 
subsequently enroll a total of 24 healthy 
participants (of whom had increases in 
motor excitability in the prescreen) into a 4 
visit, randomized, sham -controlled trial 
exploring various forms of neuromodulation 
on cortical excitability (Figure 1). We will 
first conduct a baseline measure of cortical 
excitability using a validated motor e voked 
potential (MEP) paradigm. Participants will 
then receive 20 minutes of one of four 
different stimulation conditions (active TMS, 
sham TMS, active taVNS, sham taVNS, 
paired taVNS/TMS, unpaired taVNS/TMS). MEPs will be then recorded immediately after stimulation, 
and every [ADDRESS_472630] will be 
administered 3 times per week for 4 weeks 
(12 total sessions). Each session will last 
[ADDRESS_472631], taVNS will be delivered 
in a movement -gated fashion.  
Stimulation Parameters.  
rTMS:  20 Hz rTMS will be delivered (using Magventure X100 system) to the motor hot spot of the left M1 

Version 3; Version Date : 6/11/2020  
 
 Page 7 of 11  region at 90% of rMT for 2.5 seconds ON and 10 seconds OFF. This will be repeated 40 times, for a total 
of 2,000 pulses of stimulation over 20 -minutes. The stimulation target will be digitally marked using 
Brainsight neuronavigation for inter - and intra -session targeting validation.  
taVNS:  taVNS will be delivered (using a Digitimer constant current stimulation system) at the optimal 
stimulation parameters determined by [CONTACT_27156] (25Hz, 500us pulse width, 200% perceptual threshold) 
targeting the left anterior wall of the ear canal at a 50% d uty cycle for 20 minutes.  
Paired taVNS/TMS:  We will synchronize taVNS with rTMS using MATLAB written software (Figure 2a). 
This software will deliver active/sham taVNS (25Hz, 500us PW, 200%PT) concurrently with active/sham 
20Hz rTMS (2.5s ON, 10s OFF, 90% rMT) targeting the left M1 region (Figure 2b).  
Unpaired taVNS/TMS:  In this condition, active 20Hz rTMS (2.5s ON, 10s OFF, 90% rMT) will be delivered 
with active taVNS will be delivered in 2.5s trains during the rTMS using MATLAB written software. This 
software will deliver taVNS (25Hz, 500us PW, 200%PT) concurrently with 20Hz rTMS (2.5s ON, 10s OFF, 
90% rMT) (Figure 2b).  
Sham Controls:   
rTMS sham - We will use the magventure rTMS sham procedure in which a sham coil is placed on top of 
scalp stimulating electrodes which will be placed on the scalp on or near the motor cortex. This setup 
mimics the sensation of rTMS, and participants cannot  tell which condition they are receiving beyond 
chance.  
taVNS sham – We will use a sham similar to that reported in our prior work, with electrodes placed on the 
earlobe – an ear target with limited to no ABVN innervation.  
Collected Measures :  
MEPs using the Motor Cortex Excitability Recording Paradigm  
Resting and active motor threshold will be found using PEST, and automated algorithm used to 
determine threshold. EMG recordings using Ag/AgCl electrodes will be placed on the subject’s abductor 
pollicis brevis (APB) muscle in order to record motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The EMG recording 
electrodes will be connected to a standard Cambridge Electronics Device (CED) MEP system and MEPs 
will be recorded and analyzed with the associated Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]2 software. The level of stimulation required to 
produce a MEP of 1mV will be determined prior to collecting baseline MEPs. Up to [ADDRESS_472632] been conducted in our laboratory for 
over 20 years – with minimal difficulty. For this particular study the estimated difficulty will likely be 
minimizing dropout over [ADDRESS_472633] is tolerability of 
electrical nerve stimulation of the tragus and earlobe. Although we do not anticipate any issues, drop -out 
may be an issue due to discomfort of the stimulation.  
 Estimated Time Frames . We plan on completing this study over the next 6 -8 months.  
 
11.0 Data Management   
Limited demographic and personal health history data will be collected during the phone screen in order 
to screen out participants with conditions that might confound the research or put them at risk for an

as per the requirements of the IRB. Screening data collected from participants who do not qualify for the 
study will be securely destroyed.  
Power Calculation:  Our proposal utilizes a within -subject design, in which each subject will be their own 
control. Using the low end of a range of effect sizes (derived from 0.06 partial eta) from prior excitatory 
TMS/MEP studies (11-13) the proposed study will be sufficiently powered to detect a change in MEP 
magnitude due to an experimental intervention (paired active/sham rTMS, active/sham taVNS, unpaired 
taVNS/TMS) using a one -way ANOVA at 80% power and 5% significance level.

protected with alphanumeric codes. All data will be kept in locked file cabinets file cabinets or on secure 
servers designed for use and access by [CONTACT_377555].  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be formed to advise the study investigators. 
The DSMB will review and evaluate accumulated study data to ensure safety. They also will make 
recommendations concerning continuation, modification, or termination of any of the taVNS /TMS  studies. 
It will be composed of [CONTACT_377561] , MUSC psychiatrist  with expertise in transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS ); [CONTACT_377562] , MUSC associate professor and assistant provost with extensive 
VNS, TMS, and tDCS experience; D r. Andrew Mannet , MUSC Psychiatrist  with expertise in TMS . 
The DSMB will review all the data from the study in order to ensure safety of participants. We do not 
anticipate any adverse events to occur in this study, however the experienced research team has a long 
standing record of recording and reporting unanticipated adverse events to the IRB. We will report any 
adverse event within 48 hours to the IRB  and to the DSMB.  
 
13.0 Risks to Subjects  
 
taVNS:  
taVNS is nothing more than transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the auricular branch of 
the vagus nerve that innervates the ear. Although this novel therapeutic modality is still in the 
development and optimization process, risks are a combination of those to be expected by [CONTACT_377556].  
TENS devices are FDA approved for pain relief and are available over the counter. The main risks 
associated with TENS are electrical hazards that may result in user discomfort or injury. The unit used in 
these studies (Digitimer DS7AH) is a 510(k) cleared electrical stimulator that meets the rigorous electrical 
standards of the FDA. Skin irritation, redness, or inflammation may occur under the stimulating 
electrodes if TENS current is delivered for a prolonged period of time.  
Implantable cervical VNS is FDA approved for the treatment of intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_377544]. Cervical VNS has risks associated with the procedure of implanting the nerve, and 
Version 3; Version Date : 6/11/[ADDRESS_472635] brain effects stimulating t he vagus nerve. These theoretical risks associated with 
neuromodulation of the parasympathetic nervous system would also be applicable in the administration 
of noninvasive taVNS. They are the following: reduction of heart rate, blood pressure, and vasovaga l 
syncope.  
Given the minimal risk both of these already FDA approved methods introduce, we suspect taVNS will be 
a very safe procedure. taVNS is not intended to be a therapy for currently existing conditions and all 
subjects will be healthy controls with no previous history of neurological disorders or trauma.  
TMS:  
The TMS  coil makes noise, much like a loud pop when  it produces its magn etic energy.  You may or  may 
not feel your thumb twitch depending on  the stren gth of the TMS  pulse, but you might  also feel your  facial 
muscles twitch  slightly just around  your left eye.  This twitch  is just as brief as the thumb twit ch and is 
a result of the TMS  directly stimulat ing the facial nerves  and muscles that run directly un der your 
scalp. It is not painful.  TMS  can cause heating or movement of metall ic objects in or near the head.   In 
addition, the inactivation  of pacemaker s, medication pumps, cochlear prostheses  and other  implantab le 
hardware  may occur.  Magnetic  media  such as credit  cards, etc. and watches near the coil may also 
be damaged.  To minimize  this risk the researchers will have  asked you about any metal  implants  which 
would exclude  you from the study.  There is a known  risk of inducing a  seizure during  rTMS  [57, 58] 
however these are very rare (<0.1% of all cases) and often happen during acute alcohol withdrawal or 
lack of sleep – both of which will be monitored in healthy individuals . 
 
Unknown Risks:  Although taVNS and TMS are considered very safe, they are still an experimental 
procedure that has not been approved by [CONTACT_1622]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_377545] i n the study  
 
Loss of Confidentiality: There is always a risk of breach of confidentiality which may result in  your personal 
information being seen by [CONTACT_377557]. The study team will ensure safety of your personal 
information and all of your information will be de -identified and coded to mitigate these risks.  
 
Risks of Randomization: Because participants may not receive active stimulation each time, the risks vary 
by [CONTACT_17628]. Risks are greater associated with conditions in which the randomized participant 
receives active intervention rather than placebo.  
 
 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
There are no potential benefits to the subjects in this study, however the benefit to society may be a  
better  understanding of  the mechanism of taVNS  in facilitating motor excitability and potentially developi[INVESTIGATOR_377546]. 
 
15.0 Drugs or Devices   
The closed -loop taVNS  and TMS  stimulation system s are stored at the MUSC Brain Stimulation 
Lab and will be “dispensed” by [CONTACT_978], study staff, or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_377547].

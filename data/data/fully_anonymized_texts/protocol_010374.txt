A. RATIONALE AND PURPOSE OF RESEARCH .  (What question is being asked?)  
 
Victims of sexual assault, intimate partner violence, child neglect, and other forms of abuse depend on service 
providers to help them find saf ety, access resources, and seek justice. This work is critically important to 
survivors but often has negative consequences for individuals who assist them. As a result, a burgeoning body 
of literature has tried to document the emotional strain of this wor k (see Elwood, Mott, Lohr, & Galovski, 2011; 
Molnar et al., 2017; Sabin- Farrell & Turpin, 2003, for reviews). We d efine “secondary trauma” as the result of 
repeated empathetic engagement with traumatized populations. When workers burno ut, it increases oper ating 
costs for organizations and decreases the quality of services provided (Powell and York 1992; Ullman and 
Townsend 2007). The scholarship, however, has yet to fully theorize the occupational hazards of victim service 
provision and there are few theoretically and empi[INVESTIGATOR_675414] (Bercier & Maynard, 2015). This 
research seeks to develop, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , and evaluate an intervention response that will help mitigate the 
negative impacts of secondary trauma.    
 
 B. RESEARC H PROCEDURES INVOLVED. Provide a short description of sequence and methods of 
procedures that will be performed with human subjects. Include details of painful or uncomfortable procedures, frequency of procedures, time involved, names of psychological test s, questionnaires, restrictions  on usual life 
patterns, and follow up procedures.  
If you are planning on posting flyers, posters, etc. anywhere on Campus, 
you must check with the building managers and/or departments located in MSU buildings and obtain their 
approval prior to the postin g. 
 
This proposed research will develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a somatically -oriented mindfulness curriculum designed to 
reduce the symptoms of  occupational -based secondary trauma (ST) among victim service providers working in 
Montana. The content of the curriculum wil l be based on our previously published text Secondary Trauma in 
the Workplace: Tools for Awareness, Self -Care, and Organizational Response in Montana we wrote  with a 
group of seven local victim service providers. The curricul um for this intervention, howev er, will be expanded to 
more fully include mindfulness meditation and somatic -based trauma resolution techniques.  
 The intervention curriculum  will be developed and tested with three cohorts .  
 
For the f irst cohort , Drs. Kni ght and Ellis will pi[INVESTIGATOR_675415] 
2019 (n=  approximately 15 students ). [CONTACT_182348] will be the instructor of record. The content and effectiveness 
of the course will be evaluated using a survey . The complete s urvey and consent form are incl uded in this 
application. There will be three waves of survey data collected. For the first two waves, s tudents will be asked 
to complete the survey during the semester ( wave one,  during the first few week s of class and wave two during 
the final few weeks of class). Students can choose not to complete the survey with no penalty. If at least 8 5% 
 4 of the students in each class participate in data collection waves one and two, all students will be eligible for 
some form of extra credit and/or participation in s ome kind of celebration (such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_675416]). All students will be eligible, even if they themselves did not participate. A third wave may also be collected approximately one month after the course. Participation for this final wave of data collection will be 
incentivized by a $[ADDRESS_913179]. Students’ participation will be strictly optional.  
 The second cohort  will occur in the Spring of 2020. Drs. Knight and Ellis will, again, pi[INVESTIGATOR_675417] (n=35). [CONTACT_121455] will be the instructor of record.  Again, the content and effectiveness of 
the course will be evaluated using a survey. Just as before, there will be three waves of survey data collected. 
For the first two waves, students will be asked to complet e the survey during the semester (wave one, during 
the first few weeks of class and wave two during the final few weeks of class). Students can choose not to 
complete the survey with no penalty. If at le ast 8 5% of the students in each class participate in data collection 
waves one and two, all students will be eligible for some form of extra credit and/or participation in some kind 
of celebration (such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_675418]). All students wil l be eligible, even if they themselves did 
not partici pate. A third wave may also be collected approximately one month after the course. Participation for 
this final wave of data collection will be incentivized by a $[ADDRESS_913180]. Stu dents’ participation will be strictly 
optional.  
 After preliminary analysi s of the first two student -cohorts is complete, the content will be modified as necessary 
and the curriculum will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] a third cohort . This cohort will comprise of a small  sample of local 
victim service providers. By [CONTACT_675431]. These positions include, but are not limited to, law enforcement, attorneys, 
child protecti ve services, healthcare providers, victim advocates, and religious clergy.  Our goal is to have a 
small sample of 5 -20 victim service providers willing to meet once a week for 15 weeks. During these 
meetings, we will implement our  curriculum. The intervention will be evaluated by [CONTACT_675432]  (before the training begins , at the end of the training, and then a third time one 
to three months post -training). Participation in this program will be incentivized with three $[ADDRESS_913181] of 
measures included.

   Age Range of Subjects: 18 years and older  
   How Many Normal/Control:  n/a   
   Age Range of N ormal/Control: 18 years and older  
 
  2. Criteria for selection:  
 
Study participants must be either students at MSU or  working or volunteering in a victim service profession or 
organization. All participants m ust be 18 years or older.  
 
  3. Criteria for ex clusion:  
 
For the first two cohorts , those who are not undergraduate students at Montana State University will be 
excluded from data collection.  For the third cohort , study participants not working or volunteering in a victim 
service profession or organiz ation will be excluded from data collection.  Anyone who is not 18 years or older 
will be excluded from all parts of the study.  
   4. Source of Subjects (including patients):  
 For cohorts  one and two, study participants will be recruited in the classroom.  Both Drs. Ellis and Knight are 
popular teachers who attract students interested in issues of trauma and mindfulness. For cohort  3, community 
contacts, victi m service organizations, and community advisory boar d members  will help with recruitment.   
 
  5. Who will approach subjects and how?  Explain steps taken to avoid coercion.  
 Students who choose to enroll in the class will be required to read and work with the content of the course, 
however, they will not be required to participate in the evaluation survey. We will emphasize in the syllabus and 
verbally in class, that participation, or nonparticipation, in the survey is absolutely optional  and will not count 
towards their grade in anyway . Victim service prov iders will be free not to participate and can end participation 
at any time.  
 
6. Will subjects receive payments, service without charge, or extra course credit?     X Yes   or   No  
(If yes, what amount an d how? Are there other ways to receive similar benefi ts?)  
 For the first two cohorts, i f at least 85 % of the students in each class participate in data collection waves one 
and two, all students will be eligible for some  form of  extra credit  and/or participation in some kind of 
celebration (such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_675418]).  All students will be eligible, even if they themselves did not 
participate. Students who participate in data collection wave three ( approximately 1 month  after class has 
ended) will receive a $[ADDRESS_913184]. Victim service provider s who participate in cohort three will b e eligible for 
MSU continuing education credits and $ 20 e-gift cards for each survey.  
  
  7. Location(s) where procedures will be carried out.  
 Cohorts  one and two will be carried out in a classroom on campus. Coho rt three will be held at a time and 
place convenient for all the participating victim service providers.  
  
 
 
 7  E. RISKS AND BENEFITS (ADVERSE EFFECTS)  
 
  1. Describe nature and amount of risk and/or adverse effects (including side effects), substantial 
stress, discomfort, or invasion of privacy  involved.  
 
Some of the questions on the survey will ask about personal and potentially emotional topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. While these questions may cause some discomfort, a list of resources will be provided should participants feel  they need to 
seek help.  
 
While it is not the focus of the study, the survey will ask about alcohol and other drug use.  We ask these 
questions because respondents  may be using substances to cope with secondary trauma.  To protect 
participants, identifying information will be separated from their responses  and all information will be 
deidentified when presented or published.  
   2. Will this study preclude standard procedures (e.g., medical or psychological care, school 
attendance, etc.)? If yes, explain.  
 No. 
 
  3. Describe the expected benefit s for individual subjects and/or society.  
 Survey data will document the prevalence of ST and its correlates. If  successful, the intervention will be a 
useful tool for improving the work lives and psychological healt h of victim service providers.  
  F. ADVERSE EFFECTS 
 
1. How will possible adverse effects be handled? 
 
No adverse effects are expected. If participants become upset during the survey, a list of resources is provided

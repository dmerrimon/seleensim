A RANDOMIZED, PHASE II STUDY ASSESSING AXITINIB A S PRE -SURGICAL 
THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH RISK PROST ATE CANCER  
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable):  
A RANDOMIZED, PHASE II STUDY ASSESSING AXITINIB A S PRE -SURGICAL 
THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH R ISK PROSTATE CANCER  
Study Phase:  
Randomized phase II  
Participating Sites:  
City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center  
Rationale for this Study:  
The „seed -and-soil‟ hypothesis was proposed by [CONTACT_516483] 1889, and suggests that the biological 
characteristics of certain tissues may foster invasion and growth of metastases.[ADDRESS_669372] increased metastatic 
potential – niche prevalence could therefore serve as a personalized  supplement to current 
prognostic models.[ADDRESS_669373] as a target of anticancer 
therapy, preventing metastases from developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Treatment of pat ients with high -risk prostate 
cancer with axitinib will decrease the extent of pre -metastatic niche formation.  Consequently, 
patients may experience improved clinical outcome (delayed biochemical recurrence and 
prolonged time to metastatic recurrence/over all survival (OS)).   
Primary Objective:  
To determine if axinitinb modulates pre -metastatic niche density in patients with high -risk 
prostate cancer  
Secondary Objective(s):  
 To determine if therapy with axitinib prolongs time to biochemical recurrence  
 To determine if pSTAT3 in tumor tissue is associated with biochemical recurrence  
 To determine if MDSC recruitment in tumor tissue is associated with biochemical 
recurrence  
 To determine if lysyl oxidase (LOX) expression in tumor tissue is associated with 
biochemical recurrence  
 To evaluate time to metastatic recurrence  
 To evaluate the rates of urinary incontinence (grade ≥ 3) and erectile dysfunction (grade 
≥ 3) associated with preoperative axitinib therapy (as defined by [CONTACT_3989] 4.0 criteria)  
 To evaluate chan ges in blood -based biomarkers (pSTAT3 and selected angiogenic 
factors) from baseline to the time of prostatectomy

Assessments while on Study  
 Physical examination: to identify any changes in the subject‟s mental and medical conditions 
since baseline assessment that would make him/her ineligible for the study. This will  occur 
at day 15 and day 28 of protocol -based therapy  for patients randomized to the Axitinib arm 
only.  Patients will then be evaluated in the clinic with a physical examination and 
examination for pertinent  toxicities one month following prostatectomy (constituting a 
standard post -operative assessment), and then every 3 months, until evidence of disease 
progression, death, or initiation of a subsequent line of prostate cancer therapy.

development of metastatic recurrence.  
 Blood will be sequestered for correlative studies (see section 10.1) at baseline and at the time 
of prostatectomy , as well as the post -prostat ectomy follow -up visit 4 weeks following the 
procedure.  A total of 20 mL of blood will be collected at each of these visits; [ADDRESS_669385]. Marcin Kortylewski (Beckman Research Institute, 
Room 3220).   
  
 
Post-Study Assessments  
 Any patient who is discontinued from study treatment for any r eason other than progressive 
disease (PD) will continue to have PSA measurements every 24 weeks (+/ - 2 weeks) until 
the patient starts another anticancer therapy. The investigator or his/ designee will continue 
collecting information on the initiation of a nticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_516466].  All new anticancer therapy therapi[INVESTIGATOR_516467].  
 
Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
 
The City of Hope main laboratory is to be used to perform all clinical laboratory assessments.  
Laboratory tests should be performed as indicated in the Study Calendar, section 10.0.  All 
laboratories prior to week 9 may be performed/collected within +/ - 3 days of the dates specified 
in the study calendar.   From week 9 onwards, all laboratories may be performed/collected within 
+/- [ADDRESS_669386] dose of study drug should be repeated at the PI‟s 
discretion until the values return to normal or baseline.  
 
Results for all unscheduled clinical laboratory assessments (i.e., hematology, TSH/T 4, 
coagulation parameters) should be recorded on an unscheduled laboratory form in the eCRF.  
 
Hematology and Clinical Chemistry  
 
Hematology and clinical chemistry laborato ry parameters that should be reported  include white 
blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon 
dioxide, BUN, creatinine, and blood glucose .  Assays for hematology and clinical chemistry 
should be performed  at baseline, at 2, [ADDRESS_669387] (LFT) panel is conducted, this panel should include the 
following: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and total bilirubin.  A direct bilirubin level 
should be obtained if the total bilirubin level is greater than 1.5 x  upper limit of normal (ULN).  
Liver chemistry threshold stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_516468].   
 
Evaluation of Proteinuria  
 
Proteinuria will be evaluated using the urine protein to creatinine ratio  (UPC; see Appendix B ).  
UPC will be determined at times specified in the Study Calendar .   
 
Coagulation Tests  
 
Coagulation tests should be performed as specified in the Study Calendar and also in response to 
an AE/SAE as clinically indicated.  Coagulation  tests include activated partial thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) ,prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR).  
 
Lipid Tests  
 
Lipid tests include cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein (HDL), low -density lipoprotein (LDL), 
and triglycerides.  Th ese tests should be performed as specified in the Study Calendar .  
Additional testing may be performed if clinically indicated.  In such a case, the subject should be 
in a fasting state.  
 
Thyroid Function Tests  
 
Thyroid function tests to assess thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (free T 4) 
should be performed as specified in the Study Calendar .  Unscheduled thyroid function tests 
(TSH and free T 4) may be performed if clinically indicated (e.g., if a subject develops signs and 
symptoms suggest ive of hypothyroidism).  
 
Statistical Considerations:  
The primary endpoint of this study is pre -metastatic niche density, as defined by [CONTACT_516484]1 clusters in [ADDRESS_669388] 40x microscopic fields.   We will use a two sample 
student‟s T -test to compare the primary endpoint of pre -metastatic niche  density in the regional 
lymph nodes of patients treated with axitinib, as compared to the pre -metastatic niche density in 
the lymph nodes of patients enrolled on the control arm.   With a sample of [ADDRESS_669389] 80% power to determine  significance across groups if the average niche density is

2.[ADDRESS_669393] outcomes outside of 
biochemical recurrence, such as the risk of metastases and cancer-specific death.8,9 Appropriate 
identification of patients at higher likelihood for such outcomes may provide an opportunity for 
therapeutic interventions to mitigate this risk.  
 
2.2 Personalizing prognostic models in prostate cancer: The pre-metastatic niche. 
The „seed-and-soil‟ hypothesis was proposed by [CONTACT_516483] 1889, and suggests that the biological 
characteristics of certain tissues may foster invasion and growth of metastases.[ADDRESS_669394] increased metastatic potential – niche prevalence 
. 
[ADDRESS_669395] as a target of anticancer therapy, preventing metastases from developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  A 
necessary precursor to clinical use of the pre-metastatic niche is accurate molecular characterization of 
t
his entity.  The seminal studies defining the composition of the pre-metastatic niche are described herein.  
 
2.3 VEGFR1+ Bone Marrow Derived Cells (BMDCs) initiate the pre-metastatic niche.  
K
aplan et al assessed mice injected with either LLC or B16 melanoma cells.  While LLC cells have a 
predilection for pulmonary spread, B16 melanoma cells metastasize in a more widely disseminated 
fashion.  At day 14 after tumor inoculation, it was observed that deposition and clustering of VEGFR1+ 
BMDCs occurred in terminal bronchioles prior to arrival of tumor cells.  By [CONTACT_4475] 23, tumor 
micrometastases were visible.  Sites of BMDC clustering appeared to be tumor specific; while LLC cells 
deposited only in the lungs and liver, B16 cells deposited in a range of tissues, such as the lung, liver, 
testis and spleen.  VEGFR1+ BMDCs recruited to pre-metastatic niche sites had increased expression of 
the fibronectin receptor VLA-4 (integrin 
 4
1), implicating the role of fibronectin in BMDC clustering.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_669396] cancer cells (wild type, WT) or MDA- MB-[ADDRESS_669397] the VEGFR1+ BMDCs that populate the pre-metastatic niche, a proportion are MDSCs, 
characterized by a Gr-1+/MAC1+ immunophenotype.[ADDRESS_669398] Hua Yu‟s laboratory at our institution suggests that 
Stat3 may further activate tumor angiogenesis, promoting a functional tumor micro-environment.14  Thus, 
abrogation of Stat3-mediated MDSC recruitment to the pre-metastatic niche may reduce metastatic 
potential.  As discussed in the subsequent section, therapy with a VEGF-TKI could potentially inhibit 
these Stat3-mediated effects.     
 
2.6 Preliminary Data: VEGF-TKI therapy decreases MDSC accumulation in tumor tissue.   
We have previously reported a series of experiments in Renca-tumor bearing mice suggesting an 
antitumor effect of sunitinib that is Stat3 dependent.15  Specifically, our studies demonstrate a reduction in 
Stat3 activation in MDSCs with sunitinib therapy.  This reduction correlated with a decrease in 
expression of Stat3-mediated pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF and CXCL2 (the latter inhibits 
endothelial progenitor cell recruitment).16 Furthermore, treatment with sunitinib decreased recruitment of 
MDSCs to tumor tissue.

 2.7
 Preliminary Data: The pre-metastatic niche is detectable in high-risk prostate cancer.  
To determine the role of the pre-metastatic niche in prostate cancer, we embarked on a separate 
retrospective study, specifically examining the predictive role of the niche in the benign lymph nodes of 
men with high risk prostate cancer.  In COH IRB [ZIP_CODE], the City of Hope Prostate Cancer Database 
(COH Database) was used to identify 46 patients with high-risk PCa (baseline PSA > 20, pT3a-4 disease, 
or biopsy Gleason 8-10) who had undergone radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection 
(PLND).  The COH PCR prospectively collects clinical data associated with patients undergoing 
prostatectomy at the institution, and warehouses available clinical specimens.  Benign tissue specimens 
(paraffin-embedded) derived from PLND were acquired for each patient, and were stained for VEGFR1 
expression.  VEGFR1+ cell clusters were counted within [ADDRESS_669399] 40x fields, and the cluster count was 
averaged. The average cluster count was 3.13 (standard deviation, 1.43), and ranged from 0-6.25 (see 
Figure 1).  VEGFR1+ clustering in PLND specimens was a significant predictor of biochemical 
recurrence on multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, and outperformed other variables including 
established prognostic factors such as age, extracapsular spread, seminal vesicle invasion, and the 
aforementioned high-risk features.  Patients with increased VEGFR1+ clustering pelvic lymph node tissue 
had a shorter interval to biochemical recurrence (HR 0.18, P<0.10). These preliminary results indicate 
that increased VEGFR1+ cell clustering in benign nodal tissue may predict poorer clinical outcome in 
patients with high-risk PCa.  Our dataset is consistent with a recent report from Fujita et al (C ancer Sci  
2009; 100(6):1047-50), which also suggested that VEGFR1 staining in pelvic lymph nodes predicted the 
risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in a more heterogeneous group.  Together with 
our dataset, there is emerging rationale for examining VEGFR1 as a key component of the pre-metastatic 
niche.  
 
 
2.8 Preliminary Data: VEGF-TKIs have demonstrable efficacy in the setting of prostate 
cancer, and have been employed in neoadjuvant trials.   
Data has emerged for the agent sunitinib in the setting of metastatic, hormone refractory prostate cancer.  
In one phase II study, patients who had received no prior cytotoxic therapy (Group A) or prior docetaxel 
therapy (Group B), (n=17 in each group), were treated with daily sunitinib.[ADDRESS_669400] suggested potential synergy between sunitinib 
and 
docetaxel; this combined regimen is being further explored.20,[ADDRESS_669401]
oring three cycles of sunitinib (37.5 mg oral daily) prior to surgery enrolled a total of [ADDRESS_669402] completed surgery, 1 CR has been reported.  However, 3 patients were 
characterized as treatment failures (defined by [CONTACT_516485], confirmed post-
operative PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL, or administration of post-operative radiation or ADT.  Thus, while sunitinib 
appears to be relatively safe in the neoadjuvant setting (no grade 4 toxicities or toxicity-related 
discontinuations were observed), there may be rationale to explore more potent agents in this setting, such 
as axitinib.   
 
2.9 Rationale for axitinib therapy.  
Axitinib has been chosen because of its higher affinity for VEGFR1  compared to sunitinib (IC 50 = 1 nM 
versus 23 nM).24 Given the role of VEGFR1+ cells in establishing the pre-metastatic niche, axitinib will 
presumably have a more potent effect on niche formation.  Axitinib is currently under investigation in 
several solid malignancies.25,[ADDRESS_669403] pronounced development is in the domain of mRCC.  In 
a study including 62 patients who had received prior sorafenib therapy, an ORR of 22.6% and median 
duration of response of 17.5 months were recorded.27  In a separate study including patients who had 
failed prior cytokine therapy, an even more impressive ORR of 44.6% was recorded.28  A phase III study 
of
 axitinib as second-line therapy in mRCC is ongoing, comparing the agent to sorafenib.29  The extensive 
pr
ior use of axitinib in other solid tumors suggests the safety of monotherapy.   
 
2.10 Axitinib 
Axitinib is an oral, potent and selective inhibitor of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptor s 
1, 2, and 3. It is being evaluated for use in solid tumors. VEGF receptors are critical components of the 
processes leading to the branching, extension, and survival of endothelial cells which form new blood 
vessels during angiogenesis, an absolute necessity for tumor growth beyond microscopic size. In 
nonclinical tumor mouse models, twice-daily (BID) oral administration of axitinib demonstrated 
consistent and significant anti-tumor efficacy (marked inhibitory effect on local and distant tumor 
metastasis and prolonged animal survival). In multiple animal models, combination of axitinib with 
various standard chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, docetaxel or carboplatin) and other antiangiogenic agents (eg, 
bevacizumab) demonstrated improved benefit compared with single-agent chemotherapeutic/ 
antiangiogenic agents. 
The nonclinical safety profile of axitinib has been well characterized through the conduct of single-dose 
and repeat-dose toxicity studies of up to 39 weeks in duration, and safety pharmacology, genetic toxicity, 
reproductive and developmental toxicity, and phototoxicity studies. The primary target organ toxicities 
were observed in the gastrointestinal,hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, and reproductive systems. 
Additionally, hemodynamic effects (elevated blood pressure, reduced heart rate) were identified from 
repeat-dosing in conscious, telemetered animals. Axitinib was not identified as a mutagen or clastogen,but 
considered an aneugen at AUC exposure that exceeds that at the recommended human dose (RHD) of 5 
mg BID. While axitinib has relevant UV absorbance with the potential to distribute to sun-exposed 
tissues, no phototoxicity potential was identified from in vitro testing in 3T3 fibroblasts. Many of the 
findings identified from non-clinical safety testing are consistent with the anticipated pharmacological 
.

 r
esponse to a VEGFR inhibitor, including the blood pressure changes and effects on ovarian follicles and 
the growth plate of actively growing animals, which are reliant on angiogenesis for development.  
Fertility and developmental effects were also observed, consistent with the effects identified from toxicity 
studies on reproductive organs and role of angiogenesis in the development of a fetus. In mice, rats, dogs, 
monkeys, and humans, axitinib appeared to undergo some cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated 
metabolism. In vitro studies demonstrated that axitinib was predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 and 
to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. CYP inhibition and induction studies suggest the 
potential for clinical interactions with substrates of CYP2C8 and CYP1A2. Axitinib and its metabolites 
were widely distributed into tissues in mice, but were not accumulated or retained for long periods in 
most tissues. The plasma protein binding was 97%, 98%, and 99% in the mouse, dog, and human, 
respectively. 
In humans, the median recovery of [14C]axitinib radioactivity in feces was 37.0% and in urine was 22.7% 
(total recovery = 59.7%) of the total orally administered dose (5 mg). In plasma, the glucuronide was the 
predominant metabolite and accounted for approximately 50% of the circulating radioactivity. The 
sulfoxide and unchanged parent drug accounted for approximately 20% of the circulating radioactivity. In 
feces, the parent drug represented the single most predominant radioactive component (12% of the dose). 
As of [ADDRESS_669404] been completed or 
are ongoing. These studies include 11 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and 24 studies in subjects with 
cancer including 1 continued access protocol. Data are available for 24 of these studies. 
A study in healthy volunteers (Protocol A4061007) indicated that the mean absolute oral bioavailability 
of the drug was 58%. Interaction studies in healthy volunteers with ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) and 
rifampin (CYP3A inducer) produced a 2-fold increase and 79% reduction in axitinib plasma exposures, 
respectively (Protocols A4061004 and A4061026). Axitinib has two major (non-pharmacologically 
active) circulating plasma metabolites, a glucuronide product and a sulfoxide product (Protocol 
A4061003). In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), there was a ~2-fold increase in 
axitinib AUC0-∞ and a 1.3-fold increase in axitinib Cmax compared to subjects with normal hepatic 
function (Protocol A4061036). No difference in axitinib plasma pharmacokinetics was observed between 
Caucasian and first-generation Japanese volunteers (n=20 each) (Protocol A4061026). Phase 1 studies in 
combination with chemotherapeutic/anticancer agents in cancer patients have indicated plasma 
pharmacokinetics of docetaxel, paclitaxel, carboplatin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, cisplatin, pemetrexed, 
oxaliplatin, 5-FU, bevacizumab and irinotecan (including SN-38) were similar in the absence and 
presence of axitinib. Likewise, axitinib plasma profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in 
the presence and absence of these coadministered chemotherapeutic/anticancer agents (Protocols 
A4061019 and A4061020). In all ongoing studies, the starting dose is 5 mg BID axitinib and the dose is 
titrated up to 7 mg BID and then to a maximum of 10 mg BID in patients tolerating axitinib. 
Currently, those subjects who could tolerate axitinib with no adverse events related to axitinib above 
CTCAE Grade 2 for consecutive 2 week periods are permitted to increase their dose step-wise to 7 mg 
BID and then to 10 mg BID, unless their BP is >150/[ADDRESS_669405] is receiving 
antihypertensive medication. All ongoing studies allow axitinib dose reductions to as low as 2 mg BID for 
> Grade 2 treatment-related adverse events. 
Overall, the adverse events reported for axitinib in clinical studies are considered manageable, generally 
reversible and expected for this class of agents (described in detail herein).

4.0 Screening and Registration Procedures 
4.1 Screening Procedures 
Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this trial will be done 
only after obtaining written informed consent.  Documentation of the informed consent for screening will 
be maintained in the patient‟s research chart and medical record. Studies or procedures that were 
performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine study eligibility) and within the screening 
window may be used for baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was 
obtained.  If a patient is randomized, but ultimately does not meet the eligibility criteria for the study, he 
will be considered a “screen failure” and will not participate in the study.  A list of screen failures and the 
reason for which they are considered a screen failure will be maintained.

In patients on the experimental arm, axitinib should be taken at a dose of 5 mg oral bid, with 28 days of 
therapy constituting 1 cycle.   
The date of initiation of axitinib therapy will be contingent upon the date selected for prostatectomy and 
pelvic lymph node dissection, with 28 days of planned therapy to conclude 48 hours prior to surgical 
intervention.  
In patients on the control arm, no systemic therapy will be instituted.   Rather, prostatectomy and pelvic 
lymph node dissection will be carried out within 5-6 weeks after biopsy confirmation of prostate cancer.    
6.1.2 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles  
Only one cycle of axitinib (28 days of therapy) will be instituted in the current protocol.   
. 
24 
 6.2
 Laboratory Studies 
A local laboratory is to be used to perform all clinical laboratory assessments.  Laboratory tests should be 
performed as indicated in the Time and Events Table(s).  All laboratories prior to week 9 may be 
performed/collected within +/- 3 days of the dates specified in the study calendar.   From week 9 
onwards, all laboratories may be performed/collected within +/- [ADDRESS_669419] dose of study drug should be repeated until the values return to 
normal or baseline.  
Results for all unscheduled clinical laboratory assessments (i.e., haematology, TSH/T 4, coagulation 
parameters) should be recorded on an unscheduled laboratory form in the eCRF. 
Hematology and Clinical Chemistry 
Hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory parameters that should be reported include white blood cell 
count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, BUN, 
creatinine, and blood glucose.  Assays for hematology and clinical chemistry should be performed 
according to the study calendar. Estimated creatinine clearance should be calculated using the Cockroft 
and Gault method.   
Liver Function Tests 
When a separate liver function test (LFT) panel is conducted, this panel should include the following: 
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,, and total bilirubin.  A direct bilirubin level should be obtained if the 
total bilirubin level is greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).  Liver chemistry threshold stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_516473].   
Evaluation of Proteinuria To be eligible for the current protocol, urinary protein must be <2+ by 
[CONTACT_516491] (UA).  If UA is 
2+ for protein then a 24-hour urine collection can be done and 
the patient may enter only if urinary protein is <2 g per 24 hours.Proteinuria will be evaluated using the 
urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPC; see Appendix B).  .   
 
Coagulation Tests 
Coagulation tests should be performed as specified in the Time and Events Table and also in response to 
an AE/SAE as clinically indicated.  Coagulation tests include activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT),prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR). 
Lipid Tests 
Lipid tests include cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and 
triglycerides.  These tests should be performed as specified in the Time and Events Table.  Additional 
testing may be performed if clinically indicated.  In such a case, the subject should be in a fasting stat e. 
. 
25 
 T
hyroid Function Tests 
Thyroid function tests to assess thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (free T 4) should be 
performed as specified in the Study Calendar.  Unscheduled thyroid function tests (TSH and free T 4) may 
be performed if clinically indicated (e.g., if a subject develops signs and symptoms suggestive of 
hypothyroidism). 
6.3 Studies Obtained During the Trial 
Physical examination: to identify any changes in the subject‟s mental and medical conditions since 
baseline assessment that would make him ineligible for the study. This will occur as per the study 
calendar.  Patients will then be evaluated in the clinic with a physical examination and examination for 
pertinent toxicities one month following prostatectomy (constituting a standard post-operative 
assessment), and then every 3 months, until evidence of disease progression, death, or initiation of a 
subsequent line of prostate cancer therapy.  
 
ECOG PS: Per study calendar, section 10.0.  
 
PSA will be performed per the study calendar, section 10.0, from randomization until the development of 
metastatic recurrence.  
 
Blood will be sequestered for correlative studies (see section 10.1) at baseline and at the time of 
prostatectomy, as well as the post-prostatectomy follow-up visit 4 weeks following the procedure.  A total 
of 20 mL of blood will be collected at each of these visits; [ADDRESS_669420]. Marcin 
Kortylewski (Beckman Research Institute, Room 3220).   
6.[ADDRESS_669421]-Study Assessments 
Any patient who is discontinued from study treatment for any reason other than progressive disease (PD) 
will continue to have PSA measurements every 24 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) until the patient starts another 
anticancer therapy. The investigator or his/her designee will continue collecting information on the 
initiation of anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_516474].  All new anticancer 
therapy therapi[INVESTIGATOR_516475].  
6.5 Criteria for Removal from Study 
Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 Disease progression, 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s), 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study,  
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further 
treatment in the judgment of the investigator, or 
 Treatment delays of > [ADDRESS_669422] 75% of the planned treatment with axtinib in the first cycle 
of therapy, amounting to 21 days of treatment out of the planned 28 days of therapy. 
. 
26 
 6.6
 Supportive Care and Other Concomitant Therapy 
6.6.1 Investigational Therapy  
No other investigational treatment may be given while the patient is on study. 
6.6.2 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general supportive care are to 
be used as necessary. 
6.6.3 Concomitant Medications  
Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms, including pain medications, is permitted. 
Patients may receive loperamide or other medications for treatment or prophylaxis of potential diarrhea.  
Specific guidelines for managing diarrhea are noted in Appendix C.  Anti-inflammatory or narcotic 
analgesics may be offered as needed.  Patients with fever or infection may undergo diagnostic tests and 
treated with antibiotics as appropriate and may receive therapeutic colony-stimulating factors as 
appropriate.  Erythropoietic agents such as epoetin or darbepoetin may be used at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  Packed red blood cell and platelet transfusions should be administered as clinically 
indicated.  Low-dose oral steroids (defined as < 5 mg per day prednisone or equivalent), short course of 
oral steroids (defined as < 5 consecutive days or topi[INVESTIGATOR_516476].   
Patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy during treatment with axitinib should be treated with 
low molecular weight heparin as the preferred therapy.  The administration of coumadin or other 
coumarin derivatives is not allowed due to the possibility of inhibition of CYP1A2-mediated metabolism 
of coumadin by [CONTACT_516492].  
In vitro studies with human liver microenzymes and recombinant CYP enzymes indicated that axitinib 
metabolism was primarily mediated by [CONTACT_33641]-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, and to a lesser extent by 
[CONTACT_097]1A2.  Additionally, the drug also undergoes N-glucuronidation in liver microsomes of some species.  
Clinically, there is likelihood that axitinib plasma concentrations may be increased in the presence of 
co-administered potent inhibitors of the CYP3A and glucuronosyltransferase enzymes.  In a healthy 
volunteer study, ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A inhibitor, produced a 2-fold increase in plasma exposure 
and a 1.5-fold increase in peak plasma concentration of axitinib. Therefore a  potential exists for 
drug-drug interactions with CYP3A inhibitors such as grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, miconazole, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, verapamil, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, 
nelfinavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir and delavirdine.  Treatment is prohibited in 
patients receiving axitinib in combination with these and other potent CYP3A inhibitors until appropriate 
clinical drug interaction studies are performed. 
Axitinib metabolism may be induced in patients taking CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inducers (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
dexamethasone, felbamate, omeprazole, phenobarbital, amobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, 
rifampin, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and St John‟s wort) and this may reduce axitinib plasma concentrations.  Patients 
who require concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 inducers are not eligible for the 
study.  Since CYP1A2 is also known to be induced in chronic smokers, there is likelihood that axitinib 
plasma concentrations may be reduced in these individuals.  (Note: these patients are not excluded from 
enrolment, however.) 
The ability of axitinib to increase concentrations of coadministered drugs was also investigated in studies 
with human liver microsomes.  At expected therapeutic plasma concentrations (0.01 to 1.0 μg/mL),

[ADDRESS_669423] likely to inhibit the drug metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C8, 2 enzymes 
not frequently observed as predominant drug metabolizing enzymes.  Theophylline, and tacrine are 
among the few drugs whose plasma concentrations are likely to be increased by [CONTACT_446580]. 
Axitinib is highly bound to proteins in human plasma (99.5% bound at concentrations between 0.2 to 20 
μg/mL).  Therefore, drug interactions with other agents that are also highly bound to plasma proteins are a 
possibility. 
Patients who need to be on chronic antacid therapy with histamine H 2 antagonists (eg, cimetidine 
[Tagamet®], famotidine [Pepcid®], nizatidine [Axid®], ranitidine [Zantac®]), proton-pump inhibitors (eg, 
lansoprazole [Prevacid®], rabeprazole [Aciphex®], pantoprazole [Protonix®], and esomeprazole 
[Nexium®]), or locally acting antacids (eg, Maalox®, Milk of Magnesia®, Amphojel®) should stagger the 
timing of their axitinib and antacid dosing.  Patients should avoid use of antacids for 2 hours before 
through 2 hours after taking axitinib tablets.  Note, however, that patients taking the proton-pump 
inhibitor omeprazole (Prilosec®) are not eligible for this study and that patients should not use omeprazole 
while taking axitinib tablets because omeprazole is a CYP1A2 inducer. 
Axitinib is not likely to have drug-drug interactions with commonly used antihypertensive agents 
belonging to the class of ACE inhibitors including angiotensin II receptor antagonists (enalapril, 
captopril, losartan, vasartan), beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, labetalol), or diuretics 
(hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide).  Within the class of calcium channel blockers, verapamil, and to a 
lesser extent nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and diltiazem have a potential for increasing plasma AG-[ADDRESS_669424] choice in 
antihypertensive treatment.  Other calcium channel blockers (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bepridil, felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) are less 
likely to raise axitinib plasma levels. 
The above information is based on preclinical data from studies using human and animal  metabolizing 
enzyme systems.  
All concomitant medications and blood products, as well as interventions (eg, analgesic use or 
paracentesis) received by [CONTACT_516493].  Furthermore, all concomitant medications being used at the time of study entry 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_516494].  All changes to concomitant medications during the course of therapy will 
additionally be reviewed by [CONTACT_516495], as well, to ensure that prohibited 
medications are avoided.   
6.6.4 Other Treatments Allowed on Study  
Surgery (outside of the mandated prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection), androgen deprivation 
therapy and radiation therapy are not permitted prior to the time of prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node 
dissection.   However, after prostatectomy, these modalities may be used as clinically indicated.  Use of 
these modalities will be recorded in the data capture form.    
7.0 Dose Delays/Modifications for Adverse Events 
This section contains recommendations for the management of adverse events except hypertension and 
proteinuria which are discussed in subsequent sections.   The following table is provided as a reference for 
guiding dose reductions.  Notably, given the short course of therapy rendered in this study (28 days), dose 
reductions below 2 mg BID are not permitted.

ients removed from treatment for intolerable toxicity should still be followed with regular tumor 
assessments until disease progression or start of new treatment, and for survival thereafter. 
The criterion for dose modification for study-drug-related adverse events (from previously on-going trials 
across the axitinib development program) is summarized in the table below: 
CRITERIA FOR DOSE MODIFICATION FOR AXITINIB - RELATED  ADVERSE  EVENTS 
OTHER THAN HYPERTENSION  
Related Adverse Events  INTERVENTION  
Grade 1  Continue at same dose level  
Grade 2  Continue at same dose level  
Grade 3 nonhematologic treatment -related

Grade 4 nonhematologic treatment -related 
toxicity or Grade 4 hematologic toxicity**  Interrupt dosing; re -start at one lower dose level as 
soon as improvement to CTCAE Grade 
 2.  Dose 
reductions below 2 mg BID are not permitted.  
* Patients who develop Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities that are controlled with symptomatic 
medications or Grade 3 asymptomatic biochemistry laboratory abnormalities may be continued at the 
same dose level at the discretion of the investigator. 
** Patients who develop Grade 4 lymphopenia or Grade 4 asymptomatic biochemistry laboratory 
abnormality may continue study treatment without interruption. 
 
Guidelines for dose reductions for specific adverse events are provided in the following sections. 
7.1 Axitinib Dose Reduction for Hypertension 
In sponsored studies, patients treated with axitinib were issued blood pressure cuffs for home monitoring 
and instructed to measure their blood pressure (BP) twice daily, prior to taking each dose.  All blood 
pressure measurements were recorded in a diary and brought to the nurse or study coordinator at each 
clinic visit.  Patients were instructed by [CONTACT_516496] 150 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure rises above 100 mm Hg, 
or if they develop symptoms perceived to be related to elevated BP (eg, headache, visual disturbance).  
See below for dose modifications for hypertension. 
New or additional antihypertensive therapy (See Section 6.6.3, Concomitant Medication(s) for guidance) 
should be started if [ADDRESS_669426] 1 hour, show the 
following: 2 systolic BP readings greater than 150 or 2 dBP readings greater than 100 mm Hg.  
Alternately, the dose of existing antihypertensive medication(s) may be increased.  If the patient is 
already on maximal antihypertensive treatment, the axitinib dose should be reduced by [ADDRESS_669427] treatment with axitinib held.  
(Note: if axitinib is held, patients receiving antihypertensive medications should monitor closely for 
hypotension and restart axitinib at one lower dose level as soon as BP is <150/100 mm Hg.  Plasma 
half-life of axitinib is 2 – 4 hours and BP usually decreases within 1-2 days following dose interruption.)  
Treatment with axitinib should be restarted at 1 lower dose level as soon as the systolic blood pressure 
reduces to less than 150 mm Hg and the dBP reduces to less than 100 mm Hg.

antihypertensive medication; 
as soon as BP is less than 
150/100 mm Hg, restart 
axitinib at one lower dose 
level.   
Recurrent hypertension 
following previous dose 
reduction ([ADDRESS_669433] 1  hour

mm Hg)   
OR Recurrent dBP >100 mm 
Hg ([ADDRESS_669434] 
1 hour) following previous 
dose reduction  Repeat axitinib dose 
reduction by [CONTACT_128659].  Dose reductions below 
2 mg BID are not permitted.  
* If axitinib is held, patients receiving antihypertensive medications should monitor closely for 
hypotension. Plasma half-life of axitinib is 2 – 4 hours and BP usually decreases within 1-2 days 
following dose interruption. 
 
7.2 Axitinib Dose Interruption for Surgery or Surgical Procedures 
If a major surgery or an interventional procedure (eg, endoscopy) is required, treatment with axitinib must 
be interrupted at least 24 hours before the procedure and the patient blood pressure should be monitored 
closely for hypotension.  Patients may resume axitinib seven days after minor surgery and 2-3 weeks after 
major surgery, assuming wound has completely healed and no wound healing complications (eg, delayed 
healing, wound infection or fistula).

a total of 12 
  
m sections of benign lymph node tissue (derived from paraffin-embedded sections) will 
be stained with monoclonal antibodies directed at VEGFR1 (ImClone Systems). VEGFR1 clustering will 
be counted within [ADDRESS_669441] 40x fields, and the cluster count will be averaged.   
Analysis of pSTAT3 and related mediators will be conducted through previously reported techniques.  
Briefly, 4 mm sections of tumor tissue (derived from paraffin-embedded sections) will be stained with 
monoclonal antibodies directed at IL-6R (Calbiochem) and pSTAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  Using 
both IPLAB and Adobe Photoshop 7.0, random x100 objective fields will be analyzed by [CONTACT_384306] a 
standardized color range for immunohistochemical staining.  After boundary delineation, the area under 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_516477], and the total staining area will be compared to the area of total 
tissue.   
Of note, the laboratory investigator ([CONTACT_516503], [CONTACT_20266], or associates) will be blinded to the patient 
randomization.  A total of 12 unstained slides derived from tumor and 12 unstained slides derived from 
normal lymph node tissue will be requested.  These slides will be marked with a unique patient identifier 
number (UPIN) designated by [CONTACT_516499].  Only the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_516478]; this data will be housed in a password-
protected electronic database.  
 
Blood (a total of 20 mL) will be obtained at baseline, at the time of prostatectomy and at a follow-up visit 
4 weeks following the procedure for correlative studies to examine levels of pSTAT3 in PMBCs and 
selected angiogenic markers.  A total of 10 mL will be collected in a CPT tube (for PBMC isolation), and 
a separate aliquot of 10 mL will be collected in an EDTA tube (for assessment of angiogenic markers) at 
. 
[ADDRESS_669442]. Marcin Kortylewski (Beckman 
Research Institute, Room 3220) within four hours of collection.   
 
For isolation of PBMCs, 10ml of the whole blood in the CPT tube will be sent to the laboratory of [CONTACT_516504] (in the Beckman Research Institute Building, Room 3111) within 4 hours of 
collection to avoid degradation of the phosphomoieties (i.e., pSTAT3) assessed in this protocol.  If a 
sample is not delivered to the laboratory within a 4 hour time frame, the sample will be discarded.  CPT 
tubes will be centrifuged at 1800 x g (approximately 2800 rpm on a Sorvall RT6000 centrifuge) for [ADDRESS_669443] the gel plug to dislodge cells stuck to the top of the gel.  The cell suspension will be transferred to 
a 50 mL conical polypropylene tube.  cRPMI will be added to a total of 40 mL.  A 10 
 L aliquot of cell 
suspension for counting will be removed.  The 50 mL tubes will then be centrifuged at 250 x g for seven 
minutes at room temperature.  When centrifugation is complete, the supernatant will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831].  
PMBCs will be either cryopreserved or used fresh.   
 
Analysis of pSTAT3 in PBMCs will be conducted through previously reported techniques (Chalmin F, 
Ladoire S, Mignot G, et al. Membrane-associated Hsp72 from tumor-derived exosomes mediates STAT3-
dependent immunosuppressive function of mouse and human myeloid-derived suppressor cells. J Clin 
Invest 2010;120:457-71.).  PBMCs will be immersed  in a mixture of PBS, 2% FCS and 0.1% (wt/vol) 
sodium azide with Fc III/IIR-specific antibody to block nonspecific binding and stained the cells with 
different combinations of fluorochrome-coupled antibodies to CD11c, I-Ab (MHC class II), CD86, 
CD11b, Gr1, CD49b, CD3, CD25 or Lag-3, or with annexin V (BD Biosciences). We collected 
fluorescence data on FACSCalibur (Beckton Dickinson) and analyzed them using FlowJo software (Tree 
Star).  This method has been previously published by [CONTACT_511336].  
 
For assessment of angiogenic markers, 10 mL of blood will be centrifuged (1500 rpm for 5 minutes) to 
separate plasma. Plasma concentration of VEGF-A, PDGF-AB and soluble VEGFR-2 were determined 
by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to manufacturer's instructions from 
appropriate kits to quantitate these entities (R & D Systems).  These methods have been previously 
reported by [CONTACT_516500] (Kontovinis L, Papazisis K, Touplikioti P, Andreadis C, Mouratidou D,

14.0 Statistical Considerations 
14.1 Study Design 
14.1.1  The study is an open label, randomized phase II assessment of axitinib as pre-surgical 
therapy in high risk prostate cancer.  In particular, a permuted block randomization 
scheme will be carried out to achieve treatment/control balance. To avoid selection bias, 
the blocking scheme will be masked to the principal investigator. The number of blocks 
will be determined by [CONTACT_516501] (≥ 20 or not) 
and Gleason scores (>=8 or not). For each block, we will randomly choose one 
arrangement from all possible realizations Primary Endpoints:  The primary endpoint of 
this study is pre-metastatic niche density, as defined by [CONTACT_516502]1 
clusters in [ADDRESS_669451] 40x microscopic fields.  We will use a two sample student‟s T-test to 
com
pare the primary endpoint of pre-metastatic niche density in the regional lymph 
nodes of patients treated with axitinib, as compared to the pre-metastatic niche density in 
the lymph nodes of patients enrolled on the control arm.  With a sample of [ADDRESS_669452] 80% power to determine significance across groups if the average 
niche density is 3.[ADDRESS_669453] assuming a 
type I error = 10% (Calculated using nQuery Advisor 6.01)  Taking this into 
consideration, 30 patients per group will be recruited according to an empi[INVESTIGATOR_516481] 27%. The intention- to-treat analysis will be the primary analysis 
conducted to obtain unbiased comparisons between the treatment and control. In addition, 
some as-treated subgroup analysis would also be investigated if necessary. Secondary 
Endpoints:  Toxicity, time to biochemical recurrence, time to metastatic recurrence. With 
respect to secondary endpoints, Cox regression will be used (with the log-rank test) to 
compare time to biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥ 0.2), TTP and OS in patients treated 
with axitinib to patients treated with surgery alone. The Chi-square test will be used to 
compare the pStat3, LOX expression and MDSC density in patients treated with axitinib 
to patients treated with surgery alone.  Descriptive statistics will be used to compare 
serum levels of VEGF-A, sVEGFR2, PDGF-AB and pSTAT3 at various timepoints 
during therapy.  
14.1.[ADDRESS_669454] 6 patients 
or more than 25% thereafter, the study will hold accrual for an amendment regarding 
treatment modifications or study termination. Toxicity will be graded and recorded for 
each patient in this population according to CTCAE 4.0.  Also, a delay in surgery 
exceeding [ADDRESS_669455] (IRB) that complies with 
regulations at [ADDRESS_669456] be fulfilled. 
15.2 Recruitment of Subjects 
Patients with high-risk prostate cancer will be recruited from patients undergoing evaluation and 
treatment at City of Hope Cancer Center for this diagnosis.  
15.3 Advertisements  
Advertisements to include print, media (radio, television, billboards), telephone scripts, etc., will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_177449].   
15.4  Study location and Performance Sites 
T
his study will be performed at COH.   
15.5 Confidentiality  
This research will be conducted in compliance with federal and state of [LOCATION_004] requirements relating 
to protected health information (PHI).

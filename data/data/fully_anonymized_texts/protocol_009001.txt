AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    13 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Human  papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) is a DNA virus of which over [ADDRESS_513149] the anogenital area of both men 
and women.(1) The lifetime risk for anogenital HPV infection among sexually active men and 
women is at least 50%. (2) 
 Anal HPV, AIN and anal carcinoma  
Anal carcinoma is strongly related to infection with high-risk types of HPV, as has been seen for cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancer.
(3) The incidence of anal cancer in men who  
have sex with men is estimated to be 35 cases/100,000 person-years.(4) This incidence is 
comparable to that observed for cervical cancer before the introduction of routine Papanicolaou screening. The rate of anal cancer is estimated to be twice as high in  HIV-
positive as in HIV -negative men who have sex with men.
(5) Several studies suggest that the 
incidence of anal cancer in HIV -positive men who have sex with men has increased in the era 
of highly -active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).(6,7) 
 Similar to ce rvical cancer, anal cancer is preceded by [CONTACT_5019]- grade anal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_26507] (HGAIN). AIN is readily detected by [CONTACT_407020], and abnormal cytological results should prompt high resolution anoscopy and biopsy of areas suspi[INVESTIGATOR_406965]. Areas of HGAIN can be treated with ablative therapy in an attempt to reduce the incidence of 
invasive cancer. The prevalence of cytological abnormalities among HIV -1-infected MSM 
has been estimated at 65%, and the prevalence of high-risk HPV at 78%.
(8) Approximatel y 
30% are positive by [CONTACT_407021] 16, 20% for type 18, and 10% for both (Wilkin, 
personal communication). The majority of HIV -1-infected MSM have multiple types of high -
risk HPV detected by [CONTACT_954]. Among HIV -positive women, the prevalence of anal cyt ological 
abnormalities has been estimated at 26%, and the prevalence of HPV at 76%.(9) 
 
Response to recombinant protein vaccines in HIV -positive populations 
As the availability of potent antiretroviral regimens has increased the life expectancy and 
quality  of life of HIV -positive patients, vaccinations for preventable infections have 
increased significance. Poor responses to standard vaccination series have been documented 
in HIV -positive patients.(10-14) Meta -analysis of eight studies designed to evaluate the efficacy 
of hepatitis A vaccination in HIV -positive patients using the standard vaccination series 
revealed a low response rate.(13) The overall response rate for HIV -positive patients was 64% 
in a combined total of [ADDRESS_513150] yielded a lower proportion of 
patients achieving adequate hepatitis A antibody titers. In a small retrospective analysis, the 
hepatitis A vaccination response rate was only 48% compared with reported rates of 100% in 
HIV-negative patients.(15) 
 Compared with success rates of greater than 90% in immunocompetent hosts, HIV -positive 
patients respond to hepatitis B vaccination at rates of 17.5% – 56
%(11, 14, 16, 17) Strategies to 
improve the vaccination response rate include increasing the amount of the dose, the use of a 
four-dose  schedule, and the administration of booster vaccinations.(18, 19) In the HIV 
population, there is evidence to suggest that an adequate antibody response may not be 
sustained over time as expected. The use of a six -dose strategy that produced initial antibody 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    14 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  titers comparable to the immunocompetent population found that adequate hepatitis B 
antibody was maintained for only 59% of subjects one year after completion of the modified 
series .(20) 
 Investigators have analyzed patient -specific predictors associated with responders to both 
hepatitis A and B vaccination. The presence of low -level viremia has been consistently 
associated with failure to respond to hepatitis vaccination. In a logistic regression model, 
Overton, et al. showed that only HIV RNA level below 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at the ti me of hepatitis 
B vaccination was associated with a protective antibody response, while CD4+ count at time of vaccination was not found to be statistically significant.
(17) In HIV -positive children, an 
undetectable plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4+ T -cell percent greater  than 20% predicted 
response to hepatitis A vaccination.(21) Nadir CD4+ count has not  been shown to predict the 
development of protective antibody in HIV patients for either hepatitis A or B vaccination in 
any study to date.  
 
Gardasil® 
Gardasil® ([COMPANY_006] &  Co., Inc.) was approved by [CONTACT_407022] 2006 and is indicated in 
girls and women 9-26 years of age for the prevention of cervical cancer, genital warts, and genital precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by [CONTACT_108079][INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) types 6, 
11, 16, and 18. Gardasil protects recipi[INVESTIGATOR_406971] [ADDRESS_513151] genital warts. It consists of virus -like particles generated by [CONTACT_407023] L1 from HPV 
types 6, 11, 16, and 18 with an aluminum adjuvant. This vaccine targeting HPV types 6, 11, 
16, and 18 can substantially reduce the acquisition of infection and clinical disease caused by 
[CONTACT_407024]. The ACIP recommends that Gardasil be routinely given to girls when they are 11 
or 12 years of age, before people become sexually active (i.e., before women are exposed to the viruses). Gardasil can be administered as early as age 9 years, and can also be given to 
women 13 to 26 years old. Garda sil is to be given as a three dose series completed over 6 
months.  
 
For many viruses, an infection induces neutralizing antibodies that are a correlate of immune 
protection. HPV cannot be cultivated in tissue culture and true neutralization assays are not 
commercially available. Instead, capsid proteins of HPV produced in non-mammalian cells 
self-assemble into virus -like particles (VLP) and can be used as reagents in enzyme 
immunoassays.
(22) These VLP -based immunoassays and the scales for these assays are highly 
type-specific and thus, comparison across types and to other assays are not possible. (See  
Appendix III, [COMPANY_006] Gardasil Product Information ). 
 
Natural HPV infection induces a low level of antibody production that for most types does 
not seem to confer complete protection against subsequent type -specific HPV infection. 
Furthermore, it has not been possible to establish minimum antibody levels that protect 
against clinical disease. Viscidi, et al. evalu ated the prevalence of serum antibodies to HPV 
types 16, 18, 31, 35, and [ADDRESS_513152] d uring follow up. The seroprevalence of HPV 16 antibodies 
was 51.8% in HIV -positive women compared with 45.5% in HIV -negative women, and that 
of HPV 18 was 52.0% and 35.6% in HIV -positive and -negative women respectively.(23) 
There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of a new infection with the 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    15 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  homologous HPV type between HPV -seropositive and HPV seronegative women.(23) This 
suggests that natural HPV infection does not confer complete immunoprotection for most 
HPV types.  
 Almost all HIV -negative girls and women w ho received the Gardasil vaccine became HPV 6, 
11, 16, and [ADDRESS_513153] vaccine dose (99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, 
and 99.5% respectively). The titers peaked at month [ADDRESS_513154] the HPV types included in the vaccine among 
HIV-positive adult men and to establish its safety in this population.  
 
Immunogenicity and efficacy r esults for quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls and women 
Immunogenicity results of Protocol 007 showed that administration of a 3-dose regimen (0, 
2, 6 Months) of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine 20/40/40/20 mcg 
(Gardasil) generates robust anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 responses 4 weeks after the 
completion of the vaccination regimen and durable anti -HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 responses 2.5 
years following completion of the vaccination regimen. Efficacy results of Protocol 007 
showed that adminis tration of a 3 -dose regimen of Gardasil substantially reduced the risk for 
acquisition of persistent HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related infection or HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related genital disease and substantially reduced the risk for development of a compos ite 
endpoint of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related CIN or EGL.  
 Immunogenicity results of the Protocol 016 adult/adolescent substudy showed that for each 
of the 4 HPV types, the vaccine induced numerically higher HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 geometric 
mean titers (GMTs) 4 weeks Postdose 2 (Month 3) and 4 weeks Postdose 3 (Month 7) in [ADDRESS_513155]-vaccination that has correlated with demonstrable vaccine efficacy.  
 
In clinical trials, administration of a 3 -dose regimen of Gardasil to women naïve to the 
relevant vaccine HPV types , at Day 1 and the through the completion of the vaccination 
regimen, was over 90% efficacious in preventing the development of:  
• HPV 16 - and 18-related CIN 2/3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (obligate cervical cancer 
precursors);  
• HPV 16 - and 18-related vulvar intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (VIN) 2/3 and vaginal 
intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (VaIN) 2/3 (obligate precursors to HPV -related vulvar and 
vaginal cancer, respectively;  
• HPV 6 - and 11-related external genital lesions (including condyloma acuminata);  
• HPV 6 -, 11-, 16-, and 18-related CIN; and  
• HPV 6 -, 11-, 16-, and 18-related persistent infection

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  Efficacy studies of Gardasil in young HIV -negative men  
The FDA recently extended the approval of Gardasil for use in males ages 9 to 26 for the 
prevention of anal cancer c aused by [CONTACT_163535] 16 and 18, genital warts (condyloma 
acuminata) caused by [CONTACT_163535] 6 and 11, and anal intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_28601] (AIN) grades 1, 2, and 3. However, data on the efficacy of Gardasil in young HIV -positive men is limited.  In 
bridging studie s the antibody response in adolescent boys appears similar to that of 
adolescent girls. In a recent clinical trial of Gardasil in HIV -negative boys and men aged 16 -
26 ([COMPANY_006] 020), unpublished data show that among those naïve to vaccine -specific HPV 
types, the vaccine was effective to prevent development of external genital condyloma 
acuminatum with an efficacy of 90%, and protection against persistent external genital 
infection with HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 ranged from 79% to 96%.  Nearly 100% of boys and 
men s eroconverted and the vaccine was well tolerated.   
Safety and tolerability results for quadrivalent HPV vaccine in women  
In clinical studies of GARDASIL™ about 25,[ADDRESS_513156] one shot of 
GARDASIL™. About [ADDRESS_513157] one shot of a similar vaccine at higher or 
lower doses than GARDASIL™. Fourteen studies are still ongoing. In these studies, 
GARDASIL™ has been generally well tolerated. Among the reported serious vaccine -related 
side effects:  
 
Eight (8) people had serious side effects judged by [CONTACT_407025]™.  
• Wheezing and shortness of breath ([ADDRESS_513158])  
• Upset stomach with vomiting or diarrhea ([ADDRESS_513159])  
• Disease of t he large bowel (called ulcerative colitis) starting [ADDRESS_513160] dose 
([ADDRESS_513161])  
• Muscular weakness ([ADDRESS_513162])  
• Facial paralysis ([ADDRESS_513163])  
• Pain and joint stiffness (limiting movement) at the place where the study vaccine was 
injected ([ADDRESS_513164]) 
• Vaginal bleeding that lasted on and off for up to 2 ½ months after each of two study 
vaccinations ([ADDRESS_513165])  
• Severe headache with high blood pressure on the day of a study vaccination that lasted 5 days and 1 day, respectively ([ADDRESS_513166])  
 
Common side effects occur in 1 or more out of 100 subjects.  The side effects judged to be 
related to study vaccine or placebo and seen more commonly among subjects who received GARDASIL™ than subjects who received placebo include:  
• Fever  
• Nausea  
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Pain in extremity (pain in arm or leg)

humoral response to those types and preventing re -infection. Prior studies in HIV -positive 
women suggest that the humoral response associated with natural infection was not protective 
against re -infection. There are few data on the seropreva lence to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 
in HIV -positive MSM; none of which used the [COMPANY_006] assay. A study of 59 HIV -positive 
MSM found that 36% and 27% were seropositive for types 16 and 18, respectively.
(24) A 
second study of 154 HIV -positive MSM found that 42% were seropositive for type 16.(25) In 
the AMC [ADDRESS_513169] of whom were over the age of 30 years, at 
baseline, 29% were positive for HPV 16 antibodies, 19% were positive for HPV 18  
antibodies, 38% were positive for HPV 6 antibodi es and 30% were positive for HPV 11  
antibodies.  Among HIV -positive women, approximately 50% were seropositive to type 16 
and 50% to type 18. Anal infection with high-risk HPV is extremely common among HIV -
positive MSM older than 20 years of age with a prevalence of 80%.   
 Not surprisingly, the prevalence of anal HPV infection and disease was lower among younger 
HIV-positive MSM.  In one study of young HIV -positive MSM, (Moscicki AB AIDS. 
2003;17:311 -20), 14% had anal HPV 16, none had HPV 18 DNA and 23% had HPV 6 and/or 
HPV11.   
 
Although the quadrivalent vaccine appears to be immunogenic and well tolerated in HIV -
positive individuals, no studies have been done yet on the protective effect of the vaccine in 
these populations regardless of their age.  The vaccine has been shown to be highly efficacious in HIV -negative populations to date, but the efficacy is restricted to those who are 
sero- or DNA-negative to a given HPV type.  Efficacy studies in HIV -positive individuals are 
hampered by [CONTACT_407027], and an efficacy 
study among HIV -positive individuals would be best performed in a HIV -positive population 
with relatively limited prior exposure to HPV, but with a high risk of incident infection and 
disease within the period of the study.  The optimal study population to determine the 
protective effect of the vaccine among HIV -positive individuals is young (age 13-26) HIV -
positive MSM, and this group is the focus of the present study.  This study will evaluate the 
protective effect of develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 16-, 18- 6- or 11-associated AIN or anal condyloma, as 
well as persistent infection with these types.  Because the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 
recently approved for use in boys by [CONTACT_1622], a placebo control arm is not practical.  
Therefore in this study, all participants will be vaccinated, and the incidence of HPV 
infection and disease will be compare d between those with and without exposure to HPV at

Site staff must contact [CONTACT_36476](s) for guidance if a subject requires a restricted medication prior to a study vaccine visit or a visit that is measuring HPV 
antibody titers (i.e., screening and Weeks 28, 52, 78 and 104).  
 
Note:  If a prohibited medication is taken after completion of all HPV vaccination 
visits, contact [CONTACT_36476](s) first to discuss premature discontinuation.  
 
4.4.[ADDRESS_513195] of care vaccinations 
are not administered at the same time as the study vac cine. Routine vaccinations other 
than influenza vaccine that are administered after enrollment in the study should be 
given 1 month before or after HPV vaccination (or any visit where antibody titers are 
measured) during the study period. Influenza vaccina tion may be given within [ADDRESS_513196] known plans to initiate antiretroviral therapy prior to Week 28.

within 45 days prior to study entry unless otherwise specified. The screening and pre -
entry visit may be combined.  
 
In addition to data being collected on subjects who enroll into the study, demogra phic, clinical, and laboratory data on screening failures (that are available) 
will be captured in a screening log.  
 
ACSR Samples  
Although it is optional, blood and fresh-frozen tissue obtained before the start of therapy and at Week 104 will be requested whenever possible for research purposes. 
This should be sent to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) for 
donation (
Appendix XV ) and REQUIRES a separate consent form (and assent, if 
applicable). (See Appendix XIII  and Appendix XIV  for ACSR consent and ACSR 
assent forms).   
The ACSR tissue biopsy may be collected at week 104 even if a baseline ACSR 
tissue biopsy donation was not collected. The ACS R tissue biopsy may only be 
collected with the participant’s consent, if there are suspected lesions observed during HRA (i.e., not from normal areas), and must be a separate speci men from the 
diagnostic biopsy. 
 
It is expected that anal tissue donated to ACSR may be evaluated for HPV detection and typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], gene expression by [CONTACT_407036]. These evaluations will 
not be done in real time.

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  Effort should be made to keep subjects  on the proper vaccination schedule (Day 1, 
Week 8 ± 7 days, and Week 24 ± 10 days). If subjects cannot be seen within the 
protocol specified windows, then these visits may be conducted outside the window 
and the subsequent vaccination visit should be adjust ed. For example, if vaccine dose 
#2 is delayed from Week 8 to Week 10, all subsequent visits should be delayed by 2 weeks so that vaccine dose #3 will occur at Week 26 (Week 24 + 2 weeks). The Protocol Chair(s) and AMC ODMC should be notified of these prot ocol deviations 
and the site must complete a Protocol Deviation Form documenting all protocol deviations.

performed in conjunction with screening (ELISA,  Western blot or other approved 
test). Alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician 
has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot, or 
other approved diagnostic tests. If the participant’s HIV status is documented by [CONTACT_267292], the protocol team strongly recommends obtaining a copy of the 
HIV laboratory reports from this physician. All confirmatory tests and the physician’s 
note must be on file before the participant is enrolled. In t he rare circumstance where 
only an outside physician’s note with no supporting laboratory documentation is 
available, the local site should have additional tests performed to verify the 
participant’s HIV status. One of the following additional tests should be performed:  
 A rapid HIV test  
 ELISA and Western blot  
 Chemiluminescence immunoassay and Western blot  
 HIV RNA > 2000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL  
 HIV antigen test

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  5.3.7 Clinical Assessments  
Targeted Physical Exam  
This should be documented in the source documents only. A targeted physical 
examination is to include vital signs (temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and blood 
pressure) and is to be driven by [CONTACT_407038]. The 
vaccination site should be examined for erythema, swelling, tenderness or lumps up 
to Week 28. Staff should inquire about symptoms and examine the relevant areas, as 
indicated. Staff should inquire specifically about signs and symptoms of muscle aches, skin rashes, pruritus or redness.  
 
The penis, scrotum and perianal area will be examined for signs of HPV -related 
lesions. The presence or absence of penile/scrotal/perianal condyloma will be 
recorded on the CRFs. Anal cytology and HRA with biopsy of visible disease will be 
performed to assess anal HPV -associated disease. Sampling of the penis /scrotum, 
perianal area and the anal canal for HPV DNA and other sexually transmitted agents 
will be performed. HRA and anal cytology are required assessments at baseline and 
Week s 28, 52, 78, and 104. Only v isual inspection of the penis, scrotum, and pe rianal 
area are required  at Week 8 and Week 24.  
 Staff should inquire about symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases such as genital 
ulcer, dysuria, penile discharge, rectal pain or discharge, rash or sore throat. Staff 
should provide subjects  with counse ling and condoms to avoid acquisition of sexually 
transmitted diseases or new strains of HIV, and to avoid spread of HIV infection at each visit.  
 
Signs and Symptoms  
All signs and symptoms that begin during or after the entry visit should be recorded 
in the CRF regardless of grade. Any signs and symptoms that began prior to the entry 
visit should be recorded only if there is a significant worsening of the sign or 
symptom. After Week 32, only signs or symptoms ≥ grade [ADDRESS_513208] udy vaccine should be recorded.

regarding subjects experiencing grade 1 or 2 AEs who choose to permanently 
discontinue study treatment or study participation, see Sections 5.2.4 and 5.2.5. 
 
Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity/AE  
Subjects who develop a grade 3 or 4 AE should be reevaluated for that toxicity until 
the AE returns to grade ≤ 2. The study vaccine may be given at the discretion of the 
site investigator. If the same grade [ADDRESS_513218] be permanently discontinued. If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE has NOT been 
caused by [CONTACT_407042], study treatment may continue.  
 
For instructions regarding subjects experiencing grade 3 or 4 AEs that result in permanent discontinuation of study vaccine or study participation, see Sections 5.2.4 
and 5.2.5. T hese subjects should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE.

The CTEP Version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTEP Version 4.0 of the CTCAE is 
identified and located on the CTEP website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocol  
Development/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTEP Version 4.0 of CTCAE. 
 
This study will be mo nitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS). Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.  
 
7.1 Classification of AEs by [CONTACT_407044] (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or  procedure regardless 
of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event  
Any AE that places the patient or subject, in view of the investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -
threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11636], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Please note for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] –  All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) for medical events equi valent to CTCAE Grade 3, 4, [ADDRESS_513219] be reported 
regardless of the requirements for Phase of study, expected or unexpected, and attribution. For example, do not report an admission for pharmacokinetic sampling, but do report an admission for a myocardial inf arction.  
 Toxicity  
Toxicity is a term NOT clearly defined by [CONTACT_86946]. Toxicity has been described as an AE that has an attribution of possibly, probably or definitely related to 
investigational treatment. To minimize confusion the NCI would recommend that the term 
toxicity NOT be utilized for AE reporting purposes. The CTCAE continues to use the term ‘toxicity’ because of familiarity.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
Any AE that is not listed in the package insert, protocol, or informed consent f orm.

AMC #072 (Version 5.0) 05 /02/2014   39 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 General Design Issues 
The sample size considerations are based on estimation of the incidence of HPV 
infection/anogenital disease. This is an open-label trial in which the beneficial effects of the 
vaccine are expected to be limited to those who are naive to one or more of the HPV vaccine types.  Analyses will be conducted for HPV 6, 11, [ADDRESS_513226] o f vaccination on anogenital disease associated with vaccine HPV types: 
anogenital disease is defined as intra -anal and external ano-genital lesions further defined as 
low-grade (condyloma/intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_190502] 1) and high-grade lesions 
(intraepit helial lesions grades 2-3)  
 
The incidence of HPV infection/anogenital disease will be estimated in four groups based on 
all four types combined and on a type -specific basis:  
1) Seronegative/DNA negative 
2) Seronegative/DNA positive  
3) Seropositive/DNA nega tive 
4) Seropositive/DNA positive  
 Our plan is to administer the vaccine to all study participants. The power estimates are based 
on an anticipated incidence of HPV -associated disease without vaccine and determining 
whether we can detect a lower rate with the vaccine. If we assume hypothetically that the 
incidence of persistent HPV infection w/o vaccine is [ADDRESS_513227] 
size and associated lower ra te of infection that can be detected with the anticipated numbers 
of patients for a “per protocol” population for each HPV type. No adjustments were made for the fact that we are looking at four distinct HPV types.  
 
8.2 Endpoints  
8.2.1 Primary Endpoints  
• Any incident AIN or anal/perianal condyloma associated with HPV 16, 18, 6 or 
11 DNA (as determined by [CONTACT_407046]). No biopsies 
will be taken of penile/scrotal lesions and incident penile/scrotal condyloma will 
be considered an e ndpoint if associated with a positive penile/scrotal sample for 
HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18 DNA at the same visit.  
• Diagnosis of HGAIN related to vaccine HPV types at any time during the study is also a study endpoint.  Subjects with HGAIN should be treated but should remain 
in follow -up during the study per the routine study calendar.  
• Any persistent anogenital infection with HPV 16, 18, [ADDRESS_513228] 
be positive for beta -globin DNA.   
 
8.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    40 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  • Occurrence of grade ≥ 3 AEs that are possibly, probably or definitely related to 
the vaccine.  
• Longitudinal changes in plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4+ cell count from Baseline.  
• Level of HPV antibodies to types 6, 11, 16 and 18, at Bas eline, one month after 
the completion of HPV vaccination series and Weeks 52, 76 and 104.  
 
8.2.3 Tertiary Endpoints  
• Level of HPV DNA before and after vaccination.  
• Type and level of HPV DNA in the oral cavity  
• HPV strain variation before and after receipt of  the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
• Baseline prevalence and incidence of penile gonorrhea and Chlamydia infection.  
• Change in young men’s risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and STI diagnosis 
after HPV vaccination.  
 
8.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
Based on the existing literature among young HIV -positive MSM (Moscicki AB AIDS. 
2003;17:311 -20) it was assumed that the baseline prevalence of HPV 16 DNA would be 14% 
DNA-positive, and an additional 14% was estimated to be seropositive.  Therefore 72% would be eligible for PPE analysis.  For HPV18, we assumed 0% to be DNA -positive and 
10% to be seropositive, therefore 90% would be eligible for PPE analysis.  HPV 6 and HPV 
11 were presented combined in the paper at a total of 23%.  We can assume for our purposes 
that each was found at 16% for 6 and 8% for HPV 11.  Assuming another 16% and 8% to be 
seropositive for 6 and 11, respectively, therefore we assume that 68% would be available for 
PPE analyses for HPV 6  and 84% for HPV 11.  
 
Data on incidence HPV inf ection or disease are available on the placebo group from the 
[COMPANY_006] [ADDRESS_513229] if it reduces the 
anticipated incidence of HPV infection/anogenital disease by 75% overall in the study 
population.  
 
It is anticipated that 150 patients will be recruited and followed for two years for a total of 
300 person-years.  The ITT [COMPANY_006] placebo rates were used to determine the number of events 
(HPV -type specific AIN or persistent infection) that are expected wit h 200 person-years.  If 
the vaccine has a 75% efficacy rate, then the number of events expected on the vaccine would be 25% of that expected using the [COMPANY_006] rates.  Using the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution with the standard deviation base d on the [COMPANY_006] rate (conservative 
approach), there will be 99% power to detect the following differences at the one -sided 0.10 
significance level with 150 patients followed for 2 years.

 It is anticipated that there will be 100 HPV -type naïve patients for each HPV type.  If the 
vaccine has a 75% protective effect, then the following table shows the upper the estimated

8.[ADDRESS_513233] one dose of study vaccine. We will report the adverse 
event rate as defined by 8.2.2 with a corresponding upper bound of a one -sided 95% 
confidence interval. With 100 evalua ble patients, if no more than eight patients experienced 
an adverse event as defined by [CONTACT_8985] 8.2.2, the upper bound of the one -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the AE rate would be below 15%. There is 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the AE  rate is 6.5%. All safety endpoints will be reviewed by a team of 
AMC and ATN medical monitors. The final adjudication for the relationship to vaccine 
(unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite) will be made by [CONTACT_78168]. We will also 
report the  adverse event rate and corresponding confidence interval for adverse events 
regardless of attribution to study vaccine.  
 We will also report injection site reactions and systemic reactions specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
and [IP_ADDRESS] of all grade.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_513234] AMC/ATN Medical Monitor team review will be after the first [ADDRESS_513235] 
reached Week 28. The AMC/ATN Medical Monitor team will be provided data on accrual, 
retention, and occurrence of adverse events as defined by [CONTACT_42327].  
 
The occurrence of at least two adverse events as defined by [CONTACT_8985] 8.2.[ADDRESS_513236] be positive for HPV 6, 11 16 or 18 DNA. No 
penile/scrotal biopsies will be taken and a case of incident penile/ scrotal condyloma 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    43 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  will be defined as clinical diagnosis of condyloma along with a positive HPV DNA 
result from the penile/scrotal specimen on the same day for one or more of the four 
HPV vaccine types. One set of primary analyses will be performed combining all 
cases positive for HPV 16, 18 and 6 or 11.  Another set of analyses will be done on 
HPV 16, HPV 18 and HPV 6- or 11-associated lesions individually.   
 
The primary analysis on prevention of persistent anal HPV infection will be 
performed among those who are naïve to a given HPV type and who complete the 
vaccination series per protoc ol, compared with subjects who are not naïve.  A 
combined endpoint of persistent HPV 16, 18, 6 or 11 will be analyzed, as will 
persistent anal HPV 16, HPV 18 and HPV 6 or 11 individually.   
 We will obtain all available abnormal cytology and histology slid es (pre -entry and 
post-entry) and 10% of normal cytology slides for central pathology review.  A 
revised rate of incident condyloma or AIN after vaccination will be reported excluding those subjects with pre -existing high grade AIN at pre -entry or week 28 as 
judged by [CONTACT_9559].  
 
Using the incidence rates of HPV 6/11/16/18 - related AIN and anal cancers, 
persistent infection and DNA detection from the placebo group of a recently 
completed study (REF) in a Poisson distribution, the probability of detecting the 
results from the current trial will be estimated to determine if they are consistent with 
the previously reported placebo rates.  It is anticipated that these analyses will be 
done for each HPV type. For the analysis of AIN and anal cancers, analyses will also 
be performed by [CONTACT_157251].  A one -sided significance level of 0.10 will be used for 
this analysis.   No adjustments for multiple testing are planned.  
 
8.6.2 Secondary  
The safety analysis on the study AEs described in the primary endpoint will be performed according to section 8.4. For a safety analysis, the rate of AEs of grade 2 or higher will be estimated with a one -sided 95% CI. In addition, the changes in HIV 
RNA and CD4+ count from baseline at the scheduled measurement times will be  
summarized for all the subjects.  
 Detectable Ab response at Week 28 will be performed by [CONTACT_407047] (6, 11, 16 and 18) on the subjects who are seronegative and HPV DNA PCR-negative for that type 
at baseline and complete the vaccination series per protocol. The type-specific Ab 
response rates will be estimated with one -sided 95% CI’s to specify the lower 
bounds. A secondary analysis will include only those subjects who are HPV DNA PCR negative at entry and Week 28.  
The antibody response will also be analyzed on all study subjects who are 
seronegative for that type at baseline, as an intent -to-treat analysis. In addition, the 
Ab titer (as a continuous measure) at the scheduled times will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics for the subjects who are seron egative at baseline, for each HPV 
type (6, 11, 16, 18). Also, the Ab titer changes from baseline will be summarized for each of the four HPV types, for the subjects who are seropositive for that type at  
 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    44 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/[ADDRESS_513237] of baseline and 
nadir CD4+ count, and age on Ab response to type 16 or 18 - depending on the 
baseline serostatus - using all stu dy subjects. Note that subjects who initiate, 
discontinue, or modify antiretroviral therapy during the trial will not be excluded from these analyses.  
 
8.6.3 Tertiary  
Incident infections will be defined as HPV infections found after Week 28 with no 
evidenc e for prior infection: the type was not present at screening, entry or Week 28; 
and subjects were seronegative for that type at entry. We will also report 
reactivations/reinfections defined as HPV infections found after Week 28 that were 
not present at Wee k 28 among subjects with a prior history of that HPV type: 
presence of that type at screening or entry; or seropositivity at entry. For each HPV 
type, the proportion of study participants were develop a new HPV infection and the proportion who report react ivations/reinfections will be estimated using the binomial 
proportion and its 95% confidence interval. We will also describe the cytological and 
histological abnormalities observed at baseline.  
 
In tertiary analyses, we will the use descriptive statistics  to characterize changes in 
the level of anogenital and oral  HPV types 16, 18, 31, 6 and 11 at screening, entry 
and at all other time points at which DNA is collected. Significant changes will be 
defined as those more than one -half log difference from the  previous specimen. 
 
We will also describe the ongoing sexual exposure to HPV in the study population. 
Specifically, we will report the total number of sex partners (male and/or female), 
receptive anal sex partners, and active oral sex partners at study entry and every [ADDRESS_513238] of vaccination on young men’s risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and STI diagnosis. Participants will fill in the risk perceptions and 
knowledge survey (
Appendix XII ).  Descriptive analyses will characterize subjects’ 
risk perceptions, knowledge about HPV, sexual behaviors (e.g., condom use with 
sexual interco urse, number of sexual partners over prior 3 months) at study entry 
(immediately after vaccine dose #1), Week 8 (after vaccine dose #2), Week 24 (after 
vaccine dose #3), Week 52, Week 78, and Week 104. 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    45 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/[ADDRESS_513239] characteristics 
and HPV knowledge are associated significantly with risk perceptions after vaccine 
dose #1, and also whether knowledge and risk perceptions immediately post -
vaccination are associated significantly with sexual behaviors or STI  diagnosis at 
each of the follow -up visits.  
 
In order to determine whether attitudes immediately post -vaccination are associated 
with behaviors and STI diagnosis at the four follow -up time points, we will use 
correlated logistic regression or generalized e stimating equation (GEE) models with 
attitudes as the independent variables and behaviors or STI diagnosis as the dependent variables.  GEE is a useful technique for dealing with repeated categorical 
data and is commonly used in situations where an identic al measurement (behaviors 
or STI diagnosis) is repeatedly taken on the same subject.  Repeated measurements induce a variance/covariance structure that can be utilized in the analysis, for example, the most general (unstructured) variance/covariance struct ure.  Therefore, in 
addition to the odds ratios, the 10 variance/covariance parameters of the 4x4 variance/covariance matrix (since we have 4 time points) will be estimated.  
 If these parameters were found to be inestimable, then a Toeplitz structure (equi  
variance/covariance parameters along the diagonals), with four variance/covariance 
parameters, would be used. 
 
We will also use linear mixed models to examine trends in sexual behaviors over 
time, and to compare trends in sexual behaviors over time in subjects who hold specific attitudes immediately post- vaccination vs. those who do not, taking into 
account all time points after vaccination.  These models will also control for variables associated in univariate analyses with sexual behaviors or STI diagnos is.  Linear 
mixed models take into account the repeated measures which also induce a variance/covariance structure that can be utilized in the analysis.  Similar models will 
be used with STI diagnosis as the outcome variable.

 APPENDIX VI:  HPV DNA PCR SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND SHIPPI[INVESTIGATOR_406983] (penile/scrotal, perianal, and anal) will be collected at the local 
institution and shipped to the Palefsky Laboratory. 
High resolution anoscopy is performed at screening and weeks 28, 52, 78 and 104. Biopsies are 
obtained if a lesion is suspected. One of the study outcomes is any incident AIN or anal/perianal 
condyloma associated with HPV 16, 18, 6 or 11 DNA as determined by [CONTACT_407053]. Biopsies are fixed in formalin and sent to the local pathology la b for interpretation. We 
are requesting that the cassettes containing the biopsy be sent to the Palefsky lab. After the 
procedures described below are performed, the Palefsky lab will ship the remaining specimens back 
to the pathology lab that sent them.  
Specimens may be shipped to the Palefsky lab quarterly and will be returned to the pathology lab 
within 1 month.  
Procedure for obtaining perianal HPV DNA PCR sample  
The perianal skin will be will be gently scraped with 600 grit emery paper followed by [CONTACT_407054] a Dacron swab moistened with sterile saline . The wetted swab will then be placed into a 
container of STM (Specimen Transport Medium, DIGENE, Gaithersburg MD). The swab should be 
placed in the collection vial and cut with sterile or single -use scissors to allow the swab to fit in the 
vial.  Then the cap should then be replaced securely.  
 
Procedure for obtaining intra -anal HPV DNA PCR sample : 
The procedure described above (in Appendix V ) for collection of anal cytology  should be repeated 
using a second Digene Female Swab Specimen Collection Kit (Catalog #5123-1220, [PHONE_8399]). The swab will be inserted into a tube containing 1 mL of Sample Transport Medium (Digene). 
The swab should be placed in the collection vial and cut with sterile or single -use scissors to allow 
the swab to fit in the vial.  The cap should then be replaced securely.

Preparation and disposition of thinsections of anal biopsy tissue
 
 
The following procedures will be performed at the Palefsky Laboratory.  The procedures will be 
performed according to the laboratory's SOP. The histotechnologist will ensure that the microtome 
and work areas are clean and free of contaminants.  All Thinsec
tion microtomy for PCR will be 
performed at a time when all other routine work has been completed, so potential contaminations can 
be minimized. Prior to sectioning each block, a new blade will be installed in the microtome. The 
blade will only be position
ed so that it is at the left margin of the block surface. Technicians 
sectioning study blocks will utilize “biologically clean” gloves while handling the blocks (new 
gloves for each block). First, the technologist will face the block by [CONTACT_407055] 4
-
micr
on sections 
from the face of the block. These sections will be discarded. Using sterile plastic forceps, the next 
two 4
-
micron paraffin sections are collected and floated in a water bath for the preparation of 1 H&E 
slide (Slide 1, with 2 sections). The fo
rceps are discarded and a new blade is inserted into the 
microtome. Nine more [ADDRESS_513258]’s allocation number. 
 
 
Two additional 4
-
micron sections are cut and 2 sections each are placed on 1 slide (Slide 2, with 2 
sections) for H&E staining. Both H&E slides (Slides 1 and 2) will have 
a histopathologic review by 
[CONTACT_2237]'s pathologist.
 
 
The microtome is cleaned in preparation for the next block and the process above is repeated. The 
microtome blade is replaced with a new blade and adjusted for each new biopsy block and the
 
same 
procedure is to be followed. A new pair of clean gloves and a new pair of clean, disposable forceps 
will be used for each block being sectioned. The “used” blade may be retained for cutting non
-
PCR 
blocks. The total number of sections to be cut from 
each block is 13. A total of 2 slides and 9 tubes:
 
 
Slides 1, 2 (H&E), with 2 sections each, stained.
 
Tubes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (HPV PCR Analysis), [ADDRESS_513259] HPV vaccine types as well as non

 APPENDIX VII:  HIGH RESOLUTION ANOSCOPY (HRA)  
 
Procedure for performing HRA:  
High resolution anoscopy should only be done after  the anal cytology and HPV DNA PCR are 
collected. The patient should undress from the waist down and lay on his side on the exam table in 
the fetal position. A mixture of 2% lidocaine jelly and water-soluble lubricating jelly should be used 
as a lubricant. A compound pharmacist can make the 2% lidocaine jelly. A digital rect al exam should 
be performed noting any masses or areas of induration. The procedure for HRA is as follows:  
1. Insert the plastic disposable anoscope, remove stylet, place a cotton swab wrapped in gauze 
soaked in 3% acetic acid into anus, remove the anoscope over the swab and leave in place for 1 
to 2 minutes.  
2. Remove the swab and re -insert the anoscope. Carefully examine the anal canal with a 
colposcope.  
3. Re-apply acetic acid as necessary to ensure adequate detection of lesions.  
4. If acetowhitening is noted, note vascular characteristics, if present.  
5. Lugol’s solution (iodine) may be used as desired to identify areas of AIN near the 
squamocolumnar junction.  
6. Biopsy up to six of the most abnormal appearing areas. 
7. Apply acetic acid to perianal area and examine carefull y with colposcope.  
8. If planning to biopsy an external lesion, infiltrate areas with 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_406987] 
a 30-gauge needle, if possible.  
9. Biopsy  area if a lesion is suspected . 
10. A genital exam should be performed to note the presence of condyloma  
11. Subjects with signs or symptoms consistent proctitis or sexually transmitted infections other than HPV should be referred for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.  
 Biopsies will be processed and read locally at the institution.  
The tissue block, along with a copy of the surgical pathology report should be available for central 
review upon request. If the block is not available, a representative H & E stained section and six 
stained slides should be submitted. All materials will b e retained unless return is specifically 
requested. Tissue will be evaluated for histology as demonstrated by H & E staining. 
 
All slides should be sent to the following address for central pathology review:

 APPENDIX IX:  SERUM HPV ANTIBODY TESTING  
 
Blood/Serum Collection  
• Collect at least 7 ml of blood for serum separation.  After blood is drawn, invert collection tube 5 
times and allow the blood to clot 30-60 minutes in the tube. All blood specimens should be 
collected in a red top collection tube (Not  a serum -separator tube).  
• Red-top tubes for serum collection are provided by [CONTACT_3878].  
• Once clotted, the collection tube should not be allowed to sit at room tem perature or refrigerated 
for more than 1 hour  prior to centrifugation and separation of the serum from the clot.  
• Centrifuge the collection tube for 10 minutes at 1100-1300 g. 
• After separation, the serum should be aliquoted (1.5 mL for serum retention; rema inder of serum 
for HPV serology testing) and frozen immediately.  
• Sera must be stored at -20 °C or below.  
 
 
Serum Labels  
• All serum labels are provided by [CONTACT_44873]/[COMPANY_003] . Please submit all requests for additional labels 
with sufficient lead time (generally 15 business days). 
• All sites will be provided with regular labels (per subject, per visit interval) and blank labels that 
can be used for any subject, any interval in the event of loss or damage to regular labels.  
• Serum specimens must be labeled with the bar -coded labels provided. Each sample should be 
labeled using indelible ink (Sanford Sharpie Industrial Extra Fine Point Super Permanent Ink- 
Item #[ZIP_CODE]) with the following information:  
o Nine (9) Digit Subject ID:  “072-XXX -XXX”  
o Date of Sample Collection (in the universal format dd-mon -yyyy)

 APPENDIX X: AMC DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
(Version 5.0  January. 28. 2014) 
 
Monitoring the Progress of Trials and the Safety of Participants  
 
All AMC protocols that collect safety data follow the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/guidelines/index.html).  All adverse events that meet the NCI’s expedited 
reporting requirements are reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI via the 
CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ) web application.  All expedited adverse event 
reports are also required to be submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the reporting institution.  If NCI holds the IND or no IND is required for a study, the AMC site reports 
serious adve rse events directly to the AMC Operations and Data Management Center (ODMC) via 
CTEP -AERS .  In some instances, the AMC sites may report serious adverse events directly to a 
commercial sponsor holding the IND, who will then report the event to the AMC ODMC.  Most 
AMC protocols require sites to report all serious adverse events via CTEP -AERS  and the AMC 
ODMC to forward a copy of the report to the sponsor.  The AMC ODMC also distributes all IND 
safety reports to all investigators upon receipt, and makes these reports available on the password-
protected section of the AMC Operations web site.  Unless an AMC protocol specifies an alternate 
plan for the review and submission of serious adverse events, all serious adverse events received by 
[CONTACT_407058].  For protocols for which the IDB does not have an assigned drug 
monitor to review serious adverse event reports, in the event of disagreement between the reporting  
physician and the AMC Medical Monitor regarding the attribution of the event to the investigational 
agent(s) (i.e., determination of whether the relationship is unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite), the AMC Medical Monitor will provide th e final determination of the relationship.  
 
The AMC ODMC provides listings of all reported adverse events and serious adverse events to the 
Protocol Chair and Co-chair(s) for review on a regular basis.  The AMC ODMC compi[INVESTIGATOR_406993] a tabular format and posts them on the password-protected section of the AMC web site where these reports are updated nightly.  The AMC web site is accessible to all AMC investigators, 
co-investigators, and their staff.  Email notification that this information is a vailable on the web site 
will be sent to all site PIs.  It is the responsibility of each site to provide this information to their 
respective IRBs, if required by [CONTACT_11577].  For blinded studies, the serious adverse events are 
reviewed and tabulated without treatment assignment.  The AMC Medical Monitor will review listings of all reported adverse events on a quarterly basis for safety concerns. 
 
Accrual summaries for each AMC trial are updated nightly on the password-protected section of the 
AMC web site.  The progress of each AMC trial is reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_407059] -oriented Working Group during scheduled conference calls.  For phase I 
dose escalation trials, dose escalation (or dose de -escalation) is based on the rules in the protocol and 
the Protocol Chair, AMC Medical Monitor, and Group Statistician determine whether these criteria 
have been met.  For phase II trials, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241198], or suspending 
enrollment pending observation of responses in a multi -stage phase II trial, is based on meeting 
criteria stated in the protocol, and the Protocol Chair, AMC Medical Monitor, and Group Statistician 
determine whether these criteria have been met.  
 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    70 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/[ADDRESS_513271] 
(DSMB).  Voting members of the DSMB are physicians, a statistician, and a patient advocate.  All 
voting members are from outside the AMC.  Nonvoting members are the AMC Group Statistician, 
the Statistician listed on the protocol, an AMC Operations Center staff member, two representatives 
(normally a clinician or statistician) from the Office of HIV AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) or from the 
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosi s, of the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI).   The AMC Data Safety and Monitoring Board reviews AMC phase III 
studies in accordance with the National Cancer Institute’s Policy for Data Safety and Monitoring.  
Confidential reports of all phase III trials are prepared by [CONTACT_407060]. A written report containing the current status of each trial monitored, and 
when appropriate, any toxicity and outcome data, are sent to DSMB members by [CONTACT_407061] s specified by [CONTACT_407062].  This report addresses specific toxicity 
concerns as well as concerns about the conduct of the trial.  The report may contain 
recommendations for consideration by [CONTACT_407063], report t he 
results, or continue accrual or follow -up. 
 
The results of each DSMB meeting are summarized in a formal report sent by [CONTACT_407064]. The DSMB report contains recommendations on whether to close 
each study reviewed, whet her to report the results, and whether to continue accrual or follow -up. A 
primary recommendation (e.g., continue with no change; recommended or required modification; 
stop) must be included in the document. The Group Chair is then responsible for notifyin g the 
Protocol Chair and relevant Disease -oriented Working Group Chair before the recommendations of 
the DSMB are carried out. In the unlikely event that the Protocol Chair does not concur with the 
DSMB, then the NCI Division Director or designee must be i nformed of the reason for the 
disagreement.  The Study Chair, relevant Disease -oriented Working Group Chair, Group Chair, 
DSMB Chair, and NCI Division Director or designee will be responsible for reaching a mutually 
acceptable decision about the study.  CT EP approval of a formal amendment will be required prior to 
any implementation of a change to the study.  
 
Following a DSMB meeting, a summary of the serious adverse events reported to the DSMB is 
posted to the AMC web site.  It is each site’s responsibilit y for conveying this information to its IRB. 
 
Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of Adverse Events 
(AE) 
 
For trials monitored by [CONTACT_6812]’s Clinical Data Update System (CDUS), adverse event information 
is transmitted ele ctronically to NCI on a quarterly basis.  For trials monitored by [CONTACT_12134]’s Clinical 
Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS), adverse event information is transmitted electronically to NCI 
every two weeks.  
 
The Protocol Chair, AMC Group Chair, and the AMC ODMC share responsibility in assuring that 
participating investigators comply with the protocol requirements for adverse event reporting.  All AMC investigators certify compliance with NCI and FDA requirements for adverse event reporting 
by [CONTACT_407065], the protocol signature [CONTACT_407079], and Form FDA -1572 for CTEP investigator registration and IND studies 
sponsored by [CONTACT_407066].  Investigators are responsible for identifying and reporti ng all 
adverse events to the AMC ODMC, CTEP -AERS , and/or sponsors according to the protocol 
requirements, and assuring compliance with reporting to the local IRB.  Protocol compliance with 
adverse event reporting requirements is assessed by [CONTACT_407067] #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    71 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 visits by [CONTACT_241319]’s source documentation.   
 
The data entry system used for AMC studies, AdvantageEDCSM (a web -based data entry and 
enrollment system), is programmed to notify the site investigator, protocol chair, a nd AMC ODMC 
via email in the event that a site reports an adverse event that meets expedited reporting criteria to 
NCI and/or FDA.  If the site does not follow with a CTEP -AERS  report, the AMC ODMC contacts 
sites to request an expedited report.  Additional ly, the protocol chair, AMC ODMC, and the AMC 
Medical Monitor review reported adverse events on a routine basis to identify adverse events 
reported by [CONTACT_407068] -AERS .  The Protocol Chair, AMC Group 
Chair, and IND spons ors have general oversight for assuring that routine and expedited adverse 
reporting requirements are met by [CONTACT_241321].  
 
Plans for Assuring that any Action Resulting in a Temporary or Permanent Suspension of an 
NCI-Funded Clinical Trial is Re ported to the NCI Grant Program Director Responsible for the 
Grant  
 
In the event that termination of the trial or major modification to the protocol is under consideration, 
the Protocol Chair will convene the AMC Data Coordinator and Disease -oriented Worki ng Group 
Chair by [CONTACT_407069].  For phase I and II trials, the Protocol Chair also has the option of asking the AMC DSMB to review the study.  The AMC ODMC will inform the CTEP 
Protocol Information Office (PIO) when studies are t emporarily or permanently closed.  The Cancer 
Treatment and Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) must approve all 
protocol amendments prior to distributing to the AMC sites.  
 
Plans for Assuring Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance  
 
All study data for AMC clinical trials are entered directly by [CONTACT_407070].  
During data entry, the system performs validation checks on many fields and performs consistency 
checks between select fields.  Range checks are placed  on each field to eliminate entry of out -of-
range values.  Edit check programs are run on the database on a set schedule to identify and resolve 
inconsistencies between forms or data collected at different points in time.  AMC ODMC staff routinely interact s with site staff to resolve any data problems. 
 
In accordance with NCI guidelines, the AMC ODMC conducts monitoring visits at the AMC sites to 
evaluate compliance with regulatory issues, and to review data for specific cases by [CONTACT_407071].  These reports are sent to the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_241202].  In the event that 
major violations are identified, sites are asked to provide a plan to correct deficiencies within [ADDRESS_513272] the site.  Possible actions include, but are not limited to, suspending enrollment of new 
patients to AMC tri als until deficiencies are corrected; recommending a decrease in funding to the 
site; and requiring specific training for site investigators or staff members.

APPENDIX XIII:  ACSR INFORMED CONSENT FORM – AMC -072 
 
RESEARCH STUDY  
AIDS AND CANCER SPECIMEN RESOURCE (ACSR)  
 
A. INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to donate specimens (tissues and/or blood) for research.  Before you 
decide to be a part of this research study, you need to understand the risks and benefits so that 
you can make an informed decision.  This is known as informed consent.  
 
This consent form provides information about the research study, which has been explained, 
to you. Once you understand the study and the tests it requires, you will be asked to sign this form if you want to take part in the study. Your decision to take part in the study is voluntary.  
This means that you are free to choose if you will  take part in the study.  
 
B. PURPOSE  
The National Cancer Institute has set up a Biorepository for tissues and biological fluids from 
HIV-positive and HIV -negative individuals in order to have specimens available for 
scientists studying cancers and pre -cancers associated with HIV disease.   
 
Biopsy Tissue and Blood Donation  
Individuals who are having high resolution anoscopy (HRA)  as part of this research study are 
being asked for permission to donate an additional anal tissue specimen to the Biorepository. 
If it turns out that your physician needs more of your tissue for additional studies, the 
Biorepository will release all of your tissue back to your doctor.  
 
It is expected that the biopsy tissues may be evaluated for human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) 
detection and typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and potentially other research assays as additional science studies are 
developed. This may also involve genetic testing. These evaluations will not be done in real 
time and you will not receive the results of these tests.  
 
In addition, you are  being asked permission to donate some of your blood (up to 20 
milliliters) to the Biorepository so that scientists can better understand factors that may affect 
your risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_406994] (HPV)-related anal pre -cancers or other 
diseases that may occur in HIV -positive men . These evaluations will not be done in real time 
and you will not receive the results of these tests.  
We will also ask you if you will let any leftover tissue or blood that is not used during the 
study be donated to ACSR  at the end of the study.  
 
Donation of blood or biopsy specimens is not a requirement to participate in the study and 
you may withdraw your approval for the storage of these specimens at any time.  You may 
also choose to donate blood but not tissue, or vice -versa.   
 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    86 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/[ADDRESS_513293] some of your tissue and/or blood, the following 
procedures will occur:  
• Procedure for tissue donation:  At the time you are se en for high resolution anoscopy 
(HRA), a swab moistened with acetic acid (i.e. diluted vinegar) is placed in your anus. 
Vinegar helps pre -cancers and warts in the anus show up.  The doctor or nurse then re -
inserts the plastic speculum into your anus. A col poscope (a machine similar to a 
magnifying glass) is used to see the skin inside the anus. Then biopsies of any areas 
worrisome for pre -cancer or anal warts may be performed. To do a biopsy, a small bit of 
skin about the size of a sesame seed is cut off. I odine may also be used to help make pre -
cancers show up, and an injection of lidocaine may be given to numb the skin before a 
biopsy.  
• Procedure for blood donation: Two tubes (up to 20 milliliters) of blood will be drawn.  
 
If you agree to make a tissue and/or blood donation to the ACSR, we would also like to 
confidentially obtain some clinical information from your medical records that could be 
useful to research investigators. The report of the information retrieved from your medical record that is give n to research investigators will not have your name, or include any 
information which could personally identify you.  
It is possible that you may not qualify for the study, based on the results of your screening visit.  If you agree to donate tissue and/or blood, but do not qualify for the study, we would 
still be interested in sending the specimens to the Biorepository.  
 
You will be asked if you are willing  to make  a tissue and/or blood donation to the ACSR at 
two time points: at the first visit and again about [ADDRESS_513294] access to genetic information about y ou are 
ethically and legally obligated to maintain the confidence of that information. However, there 
can be no absolute guarantees. In rare cases where information has not remained private, this

A. INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to donate specimens (tissues and/or blood) for research.  Before you 
decide to be a part of this research study, you need to understand the risks and benefits so that 
you can make an informed decision.  This is known as informed consent.  
 
This consent form provides information about the research study, which has been explained, 
to you. Once you understand the study and the tests it requires, y ou will be asked to sign this 
form if you want to take part in the study. Your decision to take part in the study is voluntary.  
This means that you are free to choose if you will take part in the study.  
 
B. PURPOSE  
The National Cancer Institute has set up  a place where tissues and blood are kept so that 
these specimens can be available for scientists studying cancers and pre-cancers associated 
with HIV disease in the future. This place is called the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource 
Biorepository (ACSR).  
 
Biopsy Tissue and Blood Donation  
You are having high resolution anoscopy (HRA) as part of this research study that involves 
taking an anal biopsy. Individuals in the study are being asked for permission to donate an 
additional anal tissue specimen to the Biorepository described above. In addition, you are also being asked permission to donate some of your blood to the Biorepository. We will also 
ask you if you will let any leftover tissue or blood that is not used during the study be 
donated to ACSR at the end of the study.  
 
Any tissue and blood collected may be tested for types of human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) and 
other research tests might be performed so that scientists can better understand HPV -related 
anal pre -cancers and other diseases that may occur in H IV-positive men . These future tests 
may also involve genetic testing. These tests will not be done now, so you will not receive the results of these future tests.  
Donating tissue or blood specimens is not a requirement to participate in the study and you 
may withdraw your approval to store these specimens at any time.  You may also choose to 
donate blood but not tissue, or vice -versa.   
 
C. PROCEDURES  
You are being asked to place additional tissue and a blood sample in the Biorepository.  If 
you agree, the  following procedures will occur:  
• Procedure for tissue donation:  At the time you are seen for high resolution anoscopy 
(HRA), a swab moistened with acetic acid (i.e. diluted vinegar) is placed in your

areas worrisome for pre -cancer or anal warts may be performed. To do a biopsy, a 
small bit of skin about the size of a se same seed is cut off. Iodine may also be used to 
help make pre -cancers show up, and an injection of lidocaine may be given to numb 
the skin before a biopsy.  
• Procedure for blood donation: Two tubes (up to 2 tablespoons) of blood will be 
drawn.  
 
If you agree  to make a tissue and/or blood donation to the Biorepository , we would also like 
to confidentially obtain some clinical information from your medical records that could be 
useful to research investigators. This report that is given to research doctors will  be coded, 
that means it will not have your name, or include any information which could personally 
identify you.  
It is possible that you may not qualify for the study, based on the results of your screening 
visit.  If you agree to donate tissue and/or blood, but do not qualify for the study, we would still be interested in sending the specimens to the Biorepository.  
 
You will be asked if you are willing  to make  a tissue and/or blood donation at two different 
times: at the first visit and again about [ADDRESS_513298] your tissue and blood.  However, there may be possible benefits to medical knowledge and HIV -infected individuals in the future.

• Centrifuge at 500 g for 10 minutes.  
• Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_407001], taking care not to disturb pellet.  
• Resuspend in 12 ml of PBS.  Take 10 µ l of suspension for cell counting (dilute 
accordingly whether using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter). Centrifuge again for 10 minutes at 500g to wash cells. 
• Using a 1 ml pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], the *DMSO freezing mixture should be added dropwise to the cell pellet suspension. Gen tly finger -tap between drops to resuspend cells. If the cell pellet is 
small, only 0.5 ml of freezing media is added (and only one aliquot of cells is frozen). If 
the cell pellet is large, up to  
2 ml of freezing media can be added in a drop wise fashion. 
(Cell densities of 1 -  10 million PBMC/ml are best for cryopreservation. If a 
hemocytometer is available, the optimal concentration is 5 x 106 PBMC/ml).  
 
*Important: Do not put the DMSO containing media on the cell button all at once . 
 
• Freeze the cell suspension in 0.5 ml aliquots in sterile NUNC vials by [CONTACT_407077] a room temperature, alcohol saturated, control rate freezer container and store in 
the -80°C freezer overnight. Transfer the cell suspension into the liquid nitrogen 
temperature freezer for long -term storage the next working day.

Background Information : 
The blood sugar called glucose is a major fuel for most organs in the human body, particularly the brain.  
How and where the body uses glucose is regulated by a number of hormones, for instance insulin and glucagon, which regulate how glucose is stored in tissues as glycogen.  In a number of diseases, in particular diabetes mellitus, the glucose supply to the brain may be different than in normal subjects and brain glycogen metabolism may be deranged, which may be a cause for reduced awareness of low blood sugar.  
The purpose of this protocol is to determine the effects of altered glucose metabolism on the brain.  For 
example, patients with long duration diabetes mellitus lose  their ability to secrete the hormones 
necessary to protect them against hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which may be due to alterations in glucose availability to the human brain. 
To measure these effects, we will use intravenous infusions of glucose  and insulin ( both of which occur 
naturally and are made by [CONTACT_39625]) and a magnetic resonance 4 Tesla or 7 Tesla scanner.  
How the Protocol is Performed : 
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to come to the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research 
(CMRR) for a tour of the facility in the days before the actual experiment.  While at the CMRR, one of the investigators will talk with you about the protocol and provide you with information about magnetic 
resonance scanning.  
Before participating in the protoc ol we will ask you not to use cigarettes, alcohol, or caffeine for at least 
[ADDRESS_838870] for a minimum of 
8 hours before arriving at the center  on Days 1 and 2.  Healthy volunteers will be asked to participate in 
the protocol up to 5 days, and volunteers with diabetes will be asked to participate up to 4 days. 
IRB approval date:  April 8, [ADDRESS_838871] be asked to participate in 3 experiments  involving either 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_629071] (normal blood glucose  – Protocol A in the Figure ) hypoglycemia (low blood 
glucose – Protocol B in the Figure ). These experiments will be done over  2 days. You will be asked to 
participate in both protocols A and B  as illustrated in the Figure  The protocols will be separated by 
[CONTACT_105789] 6 weeks. From the day before each protocol starts  until the conclusion of each protocol , we 
will ask you t o avoid strenuous exercise. On the days 1 and 2 you will be asked to not eat anything after 
midnight. Both protocols will be done at the Masonic Clinical Research Center (MCRU)  and CMRR. 
 
 
 
IRB approval date:  April 8, 2014 9412M09040 page 3 of 8 On day 1 for each protocol you  will arrive at the MCRU at 7 AM. On Day 1 in the Protocol A  you will 
undergo two 120 minutes experiments in which blood glucose will be maintained in the normal range. In 
Protocol B, there will be two 120 minutes experiments of hypoglycemia  on day 1. To prepare for each  
protocol , a small intravenous catheter will be placed in your arm for infusion of insulin, potassium and 
glucose.  Insulin is a hormone that your body makes naturally and it causes your blood sugar to decrease. 
Glucose is a sugar and it is used to carefully reg ulate your blood sugar level and to ensure that your 
blood sugar level does not go too low. Potassium is a salt- like substance that is present in the blood. A 
second catheter will be placed in your other arm  for venous blood sampling. This arm  will be wrap ped in 
a heating pad to ensure adequate blood flow and accurate laboratory results. Blood will be drawn every 5 
minutes for measurement of glucose and other hormones. Insulin and glucose will be infused in 
calculated doses to maintain your blood sugar leve l in the target range.  At the end of the 
euglycemic/hypoglycemic experiment all infusions will be discontinued and the blood sugar level 
allowed to  normalize. At this time you will be given a meal and when the blood glucose returns to 
normal you will be allowed to go home. 
On day 2, you will again arrive at the MCRU at 7 AM and the same protocol will be followed as in the 
morning on day 1. On day 2 there will be one 120 minute experiment of euglycemia in protocol A and 
one 120 minute experiment of hypoglycemia in protocol B. After arriving, a small intravenous catheter 
will be placed in your arm for infusion of insulin, potassium and glucose. A second catheter will be 
placed in your other arm  for venous blood sampling. This arm will be wrapped in heating pad to ensure 
adequate blood flow and accurate laboratory results. Blood will be drawn every 5 minutes for 
measurement of glucose and other hormones. Insulin and glucose will be infused in calculated doses to  
maintain your  blood sugar level in the target rang e. At the end of the euglycemic/hypoglycemic 
experiment  all infusions will be discontinued and the blood sugar level allowed to normalize. You will 
then be given a small dose of glucose enriched with 13C label via the catheter.  This infusion will 
continue until the evening of day [ADDRESS_838872] 
an MRI scan as follows: You will be placed on the patient bed in the ma gnet room for one -to-two hours. 
A nurse or researcher will stay with you at all times during this protocol.  When the scan is completed 
you will be transferred back to your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629072]. After the final scan on day 5 , the 
infusions will be sto pped, the catheters will be removed, and you will be fed a normal meal. 
You may also be asked several days prior to the protocol to report to the Clinical Research Center for a 
"mock" protocol to see if you are comfortable with the MRI scan and/or to test your body’s response to 
either protocol (as described above, but carried out at the Clinical Research Center). If you would like to 
try the MRI procedure in advance, this test will not exceed [ADDRESS_838873] your body's response to the infusion, this “pre -test” will involve only drawing blood and administering glucose and 
will be performed as described for either protocol above, but will last not more than 4 hours.  
IRB approval date:  April 8, [ADDRESS_838874] found a  medical problem in your MRI scan, we will ask a doctor who is 
trained in the reading of MRI scans (a radiologist) to help us review the scan.  If the radiologist thinks there may be an abnormality in your MRI scan, we will contact [CONTACT_263191], with your permi ssion, help you 
contact a doctor to obtain medical follow-up. 
The researchers will give you a questionnaire to complete after the protocol .  This should take no more 
than 5 minutes to complete. 
Participants with diabetes  
Participants with diabetes will sta rt the protocol in the MCR U on the afternoon of Day 2 and only 
participate in one 5 day protocol.  Participants with diabetes will not undergo the 
euglycemic/hypoglycemic experiment on days [ADDRESS_838875] an MRI scan as follows: You will be placed on the patient bed in the magnet room for one -to-two hours. 
A nurse or researcher wi ll stay with you at all times during this protocol.  When the scan is completed 
you will be transferred back to your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_629072]. After the final scan on day 5, the infusions will be stopped, the catheters will be removed, and you will be fed a normal meal.  
You may also be asked several days prior to the protocol to report to the Clinical Research Center for a 
"mock" protocol to see if you are comfortable with the MRI scan and/or to test your body’s response to 
either protocol (as described ab ove, but carried out at the Clinical Research Center). If you would like to 
try the MRI procedure in advance, this test will not exceed [ADDRESS_838876] your body's response to the infusion, this “pre -test” will involve only drawing blood and administering glucose and 
will be performed as described for either protocol above, but will last not more than 4 hours.  
IRB approval date:  April 8, [ADDRESS_838877] found a medical problem in your MRI scan, we will ask a doctor who is 
trained in the reading of MRI scans (a radiologist) to help us review the scan.  If the radiologist thinks there may be an abnormality in your MRI scan, we will contact [CONTACT_263191], with your permission, help you contact a doctor to obtain medical follow-up. 
The researchers will give you a questionnaire to complete after the protocol .  This should take no more 
than 5 minutes to complete. 
Potential Risks and Benefits:  
The protocol has several risks:  
1. Magnetic field:  Magnetic resonance examinations have become a routine tool in today’s medical 
diagnosis.  Based on more than a decade of experience with these devices, appropriate guidelines exist 
for these exams:  
We have taken measures to eliminate the potential risk of the danger of magnetic objects being  attracted 
by [CONTACT_40427].  We have elaborate procedures to make sure that no one brings anything magnetic into the room.  Another potential risk is presented by [CONTACT_629078]. However, these will be applied according to guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA).  The magnet we will use has a static field strength that is several times that used for clinical exams.  T here is a risk of unknown 
effects related to participation in [ADDRESS_838878] and your participation will stop and you will be taken out of the magnetic field. 
2. Infusions/blood drawing :  Occasionally individuals may have some bruises afterwards where the 
catheter was inserted.  Rarely an individual may experience inflammation of the vein (phlebitis) but this usually goes away with local heat and elevation of the extremity. We would not wish to you to 
participate in the protocol if you have given or expect to give a similar amount of blood in the month 
before or after the clamp.  We will draw at most 7 oz. of blood (approximately 200 ml). Infusion of insulin (a hor mone made naturally by [CONTACT_629079]) produces no side effects other than the potential 
risk of low blood sugar, which we will avoid as described below. 
3. Hypoglycemia  (low blood sugar): Symptoms of hypoglycemia may occur when your blood sugar 
falls belo w 60 mg/dl and include sweating, shakiness, confusion, increased heartbeat and feeling “low”.  
It is reversed within minutes by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_629073].  If the blood sugar drops very low (lower than the level at which we will 
perform the protocol ), seizures or abnormalities in heart rhythm can occur.  To be certain that your blood 
sugar level does not drop too low, we will check your blood every five minutes during insulin infusion 
IRB approval date:  April 8, [ADDRESS_838879] level.  With 
such careful monitoring, it is very unlikely that you will develop a blood sugar low enough to make you 
feel ill.  Your blood sugar will be regulated to be  in the normal range or higher during the magnet 
protocol. 
4. 13C glucose:  The stable isotope 13C is naturally present in your body and 13C glucose in its pure form 
has no known side effects different from that of regular glucose.  This isotope is not radioa ctive .  We 
have carefully established procedures to minimize the risk of impurities in the glucose infused. We will infuse glucose enriched with this isotope, which we will then measure using the magnet. 
5. Urine collection:  Some people find it difficult to provide a urine sample into a collection vessel.  To 
make this as easy as possible for you, you will be given privacy during the collection. 
Potential Benefits:  
There are no direct benefits of participation to you other than the satisfaction you may have in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_629074]. 
Alternatives to Participating in the Protocol: 
You do not have to participate in this protocol. 
Research Related Injury : 
In the event this research activity results i n injury, treatment will be available, including first aid, 
emergency treatment and follow -up care as needed. Care for such injuries will be billed in the ordinary 
manner, to you or your insurance company. If you think that you have suffered a research rel ated injury 
let the protocol physicians know right away. Protocol Costs/Compensation: 
You will be paid $[ADDRESS_838880] from work for each day of the 
protocol . Subjects participating in a series of experiments over more than  one day will be paid an 
additional $[ADDRESS_838881] your comfort level with the 
MRI scan several days prior to the protocol , you will be reimbursed separately for this scan at a rate of 
$15/hour spent for the whole procedure. 
Confidentiality:  
The records of this protocol will be kept private.  In any sort of report we might publish, we will not 
include any information that will make it possible to identify a subject.  Your record for the protocol may, however, be reviewed by [CONTACT_629080] .  To that extent, confidentiality  isn’t absolute. 
Protocol data will be encrypted according to current University policy for protection of confidentiality. 
Voluntary Nature of the protocol: 
Participation in this protocol is voluntary. Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect your 
current or future relations with the University  or the CMRR.  If you decide to participate, you are free to 
withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships.  
New Information: 
If during the course of this research protocol there are significant new findings discovered which might 
influence your willingness to continue, the researchers will inform you of those developments. 
 
IRB approval date:  April 8, 2014 9412M09040 page 7 of 8 Notification of Significant New Findings:  
Personnel in the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR), the site where you are participating 
in MRI research, maintain a list of the names and contact [CONTACT_629081].  This information is required and will be used by [CONTACT_629082].  Participant’s identifying information is stored securely and it is maintained in a confidential manner by [CONTACT_629083]. 
 
Incidental Findings:  
The images or pi[INVESTIGATOR_629075]. However, if the results from the magnetic resonance imaging show something unusual in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], a Radiologist trained in reading the pi[INVESTIGATOR_629076]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_629077]. There will be no charge to you for having the Radiologist look at your pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. The investigator will contact [CONTACT_629084][INVESTIGATOR_392369]. However, further medical follow up is not a part of this protocol and the protocol does not have funds set aside for this purpose. 
Therefore,  if the results do show something unusual, any medical follow up cost will be your 
responsibility and/or the responsibility of your health insurance carrier.

EFFICACY 
ASSESSMENTS  
 Co-primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• MWT: Change in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) as determined from the first four trials of a 40-minute MWT from Baseline to Week 12 
• ESS: Change in ESS score from Baseline to Week  12  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: 
• PGIc: Percentage of subjects reported as improved 
(min imally, much, or very much) on the PGIc at 
Week  [ADDRESS_1218082] of treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in clinical 
laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, 24- hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 12- lead 
ECGs, physical exams, and C -SSRS assessments.  
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  For the analysis of t he co -primary efficacy endpoints, a 
mixed -effect repeated measures (MMRM) model will be used 
as the primary method of analysis. This model will include fixed effects for treatment (i.e., dose group), time (as a discrete factor), treatment -by-time interaction, baseline v alue 
of the efficacy endpoint, and randomization stratification factor . SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used to carry 
out this analysis. All available data will be included in the model. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to 
model the correlat ion among repeated measurements. The

 estimates of treatment difference vs. placebo and their 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented. In addition to the 
MMRM model, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to analyze MWT and ESS to provide sensitivity analyses. This ANCOVA model will include the effect for treatment (i.e., dose group) as a fixed effect, and baseline 
value of the efficacy endpoint as the covariate.  
The chi -squared test will be used to test the hypotheses 
associated with the analysis of PGIc.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] is a phenylalanine derivative 
(previously known as ADX-N05, R228060, and YKP10A) that is currently being 
investigated as a potential treatment for excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238147] s leep apnea (OSA) . Nonclinical data indicate that JZP -110 is a wake-promoting 
agent that lacks the noradrenergic releasing effects of amphetamines (EDMS  PSDB -4956838, EDMS -PSDB -2735318, EDMS -PSDB -5305783) and does not 
produce rebound hypersomnia in rodent models ( Hasan et al . 2009 ). Pharmacologically, 
JZP-110 appears to be a low-potency reuptake inhibitor at dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_202607].  
JZP-110 was originally synthesized by [CONTACT_156221] (South Korea). The molecule has 
been under development for the treatment of depression and for the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238148]. Jazz Pharmaceuticals intends to complete development of JZP-[ADDRESS_1218093] (MWT) and decreased subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156123] (ESS) . 
Narcolepsy is a life-long neurologic disease for which no cure has been identified. It affects an estimated 0.02% to 0.067% of the population worldwide, approximately 1 in 2000 individuals in the [LOCATION_002] ( Ohayon 2007, Majid & Hirshkowitz 2010), and 4.7 of 
10,000 (0.047%) individuals in the general population of five European countries ([LOCATION_008] [ [LOCATION_006]], [LOCATION_013], Italy, Portugal, and Spain) ( Ohayon et al. 2002). The 
symptomatology of this condition is well described in the literature, with consensus on the five core sym ptoms of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], cataplexy, sleep paralysis, 
sleep -related (hypnagogic and hypnopompic) hallucinations, and disrupted nighttime sleep 
(DNS) (Morgenthaler et al. 2007), with excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872143].  
Based on the interim analysis of a survey conducted in [ADDRESS_1218094] on patients’ lives (77% of patients) ( Unite Narcolepsy 2013). Wake Up 
Narcolepsy, Inc., conducted the survey through a special patient education and engagement initiative called Unite Narcolepsy. The surv ey, which is the largest survey ever conducted by 
a narcolepsy patient organization (1,350 individuals, including more than 1,000 people diagnosed with narcolepsy by a physician), was conducted in preparation for a public meeting held by [CONTACT_872167]-Focused Drug Development for narcolepsy. At the meeting, patients surveyed “overwhelmingly” selected daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872144] (93% was displayed on the webcast clicker count) ( FDA Narcolepsy Public Meeting 2013 ). These surveys demonstrate 
that a clear unmet medical need remains for the adequate treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872145].

 Currently approved medications to improve wakefulness and to treat excessive daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872146] (Dexedrine®), methylphenidate 
(Ritalin®), sodium oxybate (Xyrem®), modafinil (Provigil®), and armodafinil (Nuvigil®). 
Each of these medications has limitations, including those related to efficacy and safety. Dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate are C -II stimulant medications with high potential 
for abuse. Sodium oxybate is a C-III CNS depressant that requires twice nightly dosing. 
Modafinil and armodafinil do not appear to adequately promote wakefulness throughout the day with once daily dosing (Harsh et al. 2006, Schwartz et al. 2003).  
As a result of the findings of signif icant decreases in excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (lower ESS scores) 
and significant increases in the ability to stay awake throughout the day (higher MWT sleep latencies) when adult patients with narcolepsy were treated with JZP -110, as well as the 
urgent clinical need reported by [CONTACT_872168][INVESTIGATOR_872147] ( Unite Narcolepsy 2013, FDA 
Narcolepsy Public Meeting 2013), Jazz Pharmaceuticals is conducting this study with JZP-110 to gener ate efficacy, safety , and pharmacokinetic (PK) information in this 
population. 
1.[ADDRESS_1218095] objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment (International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition [ICSD -3], American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM 2014] ). Previous studies of 
modafinil and armodafinil in patients with narcolepsy have demonstrated sta tistically 
significant increases in mean sleep latency using a 20- minute  MWT with maximal 
differences in the means between drug and placebo groups ranging from 2.3 to 4.5 minutes 
(US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 1998, US Modafinil in Nar colepsy  
Multicenter Study Group 2000, Harsh et al. 2006). In contrast, data for the [ADDRESS_1218096] that doses of 150 and 300 mg JZP-110 could serve a 
significant unmet medical need to treat excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872148]’ ability to stay awake throughout the day beyond what has been demonstrated with current available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Another limitation of modafinil and armodafinil is that the therapeutic effects of these drugs 
do not appear to last throughout the day and are markedly reduced by [CONTACT_156225] a 5- or 6-trial, 20- minute MWT  (Schwartz et al. 2003, Harsh et al. 2006, Roth et al. 2006). For 
example, the effects of  [ADDRESS_1218097] zero on the fifth and sixth trials of a 6-trial, 20- minute  MWT (5 -7 
PM) when modafinil was given once daily in the morning 
(Schwartz et  al. 2003). Modafinil does appear to last throughout the day if given in split 
doses, which is not an approved dosing regimen (Schwartz et al. 2003;  Provigil Prescribing  
Information ).

zero for 250 mg armodafinil at 1700 hours (5 PM) (Harsh et al. 2006). In addition, the effects 
of [ADDRESS_1218099] three trials (3 -7 PM) were 
not statistically different from placebo (for the individual doses or when combined) at the end of this 12-week trial (Harsh et al. 2006). 
In contrast to the limited  effects of modafinil and armodafinil on sleep latency on the fifth 
trial of a 20-minute MWT  (Schwartz et al. 2003, Harsh et al. 2006), data from the 12-week, 
Phase 2b study of JZP-110 (ADX-N05 202) in 93 subjects with narcolepsy (44 subjects 
randomized to receive JZP -110) showed that the mea n change from baseline in sleep latency 
on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40-minute MWT was 8.2 minutes for the 300 mg dose of JZP-
110 (significantly greater than placebo at p=0.0007). The mean change from baseline on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40-minute  MWT was also significantly greater than placebo (p=0.0002) 
for the [ADDRESS_1218100] that JZP-110 might offer an important advance in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872149]’ ability to stay awake throughout the day.  
1.[ADDRESS_1218101] been conducted to characterize primary pharmacology, secondary and safety pharmacology, abuse liability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and 
toxicology of JZP -110. 
JZP-110 was extensively absorbed and showed high oral bioavailability (71 to 100%) in 
mice, rats, and dogs. In humans, bioavailability was >90% as evidenced by [CONTACT_238227] a human mass balance study, along with urinary recovery of >90% of the dose as unchanged drug. Plasma protein binding was low (8 to 17%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma. In the in vitro metabolism studies, no notable inhibition of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C 9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 occurred (15%) with concentrations up to 1000 μM. Notable inhibition of CYP1A2 (73%) and CYP2D6 (56%) activity was observed only at the highest concentration (1000 μM) investigated. However, this level of inhibition is unlikel y to result 
in clinically significant drug -drug interactions with CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates. The 
plasma C
max level after oral administration to humans at 400 mg/day is approximately 7.6 μM 
(1482 ng/mL). JZP- 110 (5 to 100 μM) did not inhibit P-glycoprotein–mediated transport. 
More detailed information is provided in the JZP- 110 I nvestigators B rochure . 
1.3 Clinical Experience  
At the start of the Phase 3 program, nine clinical studies ( six Phase 1 and three Phase 2a 
studies) had been conducted in 262 healthy sub jects and 602 subjects (two of whom did not 
receive study drug) with major depressive disorder (MDD). Of these 8 62 subjects,

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_1218102] 90% of the dose being 
excreted as unchanged drug within 48 hours. Following repeated doses administered once or 
twice daily, JZP -110 exposure was dose proportional, absorption (t max: 1.3 to 2.5 hours) and 
elimination (t ½: 6 to 7.6 hours) were rapid, and steady state was reached in 3 days. 
Pharmacokinetics were linear over the mu ltiple -dose (14 day) range of 200 to 1000 mg/day. 
Limited accumulation and no enzyme induction were evident.  
Doses of JZP-[ADDRESS_1218103] included 150 and 300 mg in subjects with narcolepsy.  
1.3.2  Efficacy of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Narcolepsy  
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 126 adult 
subjects with narcolepsy. In these studies, once daily doses included 150 and 300 mg/day JZP-110; the doses were based on the free base of the molecule.  
Study ADX-N05 201 was a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of JZP-110 150 and 300 mg given once daily in adult subj ects with narcolepsy (N=33). The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT at the end of 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 2 weeks of treatment, the mean  sleep laten cy on the MWT increased by 
12.7 minutes for the JZP-110 300 mg/day treatment period versus 0.9 minutes for the placebo period. The difference in mean change from Baseline was both statistically and clinically 
significant in favor of the active treatment period (mixed model analysis of variance; p=0.0002). All secondary endpoints in this study were also positive including the mean change in the ESS . 
Study ADX-N05 202 was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of JZP-110 150 and 300 mg given once daily in adult subjects with narcolepsy (N=93). The 
primary efficacy endpoints were the change from Baseline in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT and the Clinical Glo bal Impression 
of Change ( CGIc ) scores for JZP -[ADDRESS_1218104] (Week 12) assessment at the 
300 mg dose . At Week 12/Last Assessment, the mean  sleep latency increased by 
12.8 minutes for the JZP-110 group (300 mg/day) versus 2.1 minutes for the placebo group. The difference in mean change from Baseline was both statistically and clinically significant 
in favor of the active treatment group (two- sample t-test; p<0.0001). All secondary endpoints 
in this study were also positive.

 1.3.3  Safety of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Narcolepsy  
In Study ADX -N05 201, 1 week of treatment with JZP-110 150 mg/day followed by [CONTACT_238228] 300 mg/day for a second week was safe and well tolerated. The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with JZP -110 treatment included nausea (12%), 
chest discomfort (9%), headache (9%), anxiety  (6%), decreased appetite (6%), initial 
insomnia (6%), insomnia (6%), and muscle tightness (6%). None of these events were reported during placebo treatment. There were no deaths, treatment -emergent serious AEs 
(SAEs ), or discontinuations due to AEs. Severe TEAEs were limited to two subjects (one 
with intermittent nausea and one with insomnia). JZP- [ADDRESS_1218105] on heart rate and blood pressure , and TEAEs suggested a profile of effects 
consistent with those of a wake- promoting drug (decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, 
insomnias, and gastrointestinal complaints). Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238166] (3%) and chest pain was reported by 3 subjects (9%; all reported as non- cardiac pain) while on 
JZP-110. There were no reports of palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238167]. 
In Study ADX -N05 202, the JZP-110 dose regimen of 150 mg/day for 4 weeks followed by 
300 mg/day for [ADDRESS_1218106] common TEAEs with JZP -110 treatment included headache (16%), nausea (14%), insomnia (14%), decreased 
appetite  (14%), diarrhea (11%), and anxiety (11%) ; all of these events were more common in 
the combined JZP-110 group than in the placebo group. There were no deaths in this study. Treatment -emergent SAEs occurred in two subjects (both in the JZP-110 group): one subject 
had conversion disorder and one ha d acute cholecystitis. T hree subjects (6.8%) in the 
JZP-110 group and two subjects (4.1%) in the placebo group had TEAEs that led to study 
discontinuation. It appears likely that JZP-110 is causally associated with insomnia, decreased appetite, anxiety, ir ritability, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and perhaps nausea and diarrhea.  
In the ADX-N05 202 study, JZP- 110 treatment was associated with small effects on placebo -
corrected changes in heart rate (both measured and from ECGs), blood pressure, and quantitative ECG parameters  (mean heart rate increased from Baseline at 2 hours after dosing 
by 3 to 5 beats per minute (bpm) with little or no change at 9 to 10 hours after dosing; mean 
PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF demonstrated no significant changes). There were no clinically sig nificant effects on the ECG parameters of PR, QRS, QTcF or QTcB in any 
subject.  Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238168] 4 subjects (9%) and chest pain was reported by 
2 subjects (both appeared to be non- cardiac pain) while on JZP -110. There was one report of 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_872150]-N05 
202 study. There were two subjects who had TEAEs that were related to vital signs: mildly elevated blood pressure beginning on Day [ADDRESS_1218107] on placebo. There were two subjects who had TEAEs related to ECG findings: one subject had a TEAE of “heart rate increased” on JZP-[ADDRESS_1218108] a TEAE of “occasional ventricular premature complexes.”

 1.3.4  Safety of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Major Depression and in Healthy 
Subjects  
Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (SKUP - 9801, R228060- [LOCATION_003]-
10, and R228060- MDD-201) have been conducted in a total of 600 adult subjects with MDD. 
In these studies, doses ranged from 100 to 900 mg/day JZP-110 with the dose based on the 
hydrochloride salt of the drug. These studies did not demonstrate efficacy for JZP -110 in 
treating MDD.  
• Study SKUP -9801 was an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pi[INVESTIGATOR_238170] (100 to 300 mg/da y; N=8), intermediate (400 to 
600 mg/day; N=9), and high (700 to 900 mg/day; N=10) doses (given twice daily) of JZP-110 versus placebo (N=8) (total N=35) ( EDMS -PSDB -2275504).   
• Study R228060- [LOCATION_003]- 10 was a 3 -week, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group 
study to assess the tolerability of JZP -110 200 mg/day (100 mg morning, 100 mg evening) 
and 500 mg/day (300 mg morning, 200 mg evening) in adult subjects with MDD (N=77), with efficacy as an exploratory objective ( R228060- [LOCATION_003]-10).  
• Study R228060- MDD- 201 was a large-scale (27 centers, N=488), 6-week, double-blind, 
active- (paroxetine) and placebo -controlled, parallel-group study of JZP-110 100 and 200 mg 
given twice daily in adult subjects with MDD (N=488) ( EDMS -PSDB -3696001).  
Most of the 219 healthy subjects and 600 subjects with MDD reported adverse events (AEs), the majority of which were mild or moderate. The AEs from these 219 healthy subjects do not include data from a recently completed Phase 1 human abuse liability study in 43 subjects because data analysis from that study is ongoing (preliminary data will be  
included in the JZP- 110 Investigators Brochure) . The most common TEAEs that occurred 
≥5% and more often with JZP-110 than placebo across doses of 200 to 1200 mg/day included: insomnia (34%), headache (23%), dizziness (16%), anorexia  (16%), dry mouth 
(16%), nervousness (15%), nausea (14%), palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] (11%), agitation (10%), abdominal pain (10%), anxiety  (9%), fatigue (9%), concentration impaired (8%), and diarrhea (6%). 
There were no deaths.  One healthy JZP -110-treated subject (1000 mg/day) reported a serious 
adverse event (SAE, confusion) that was considered unrelated to study drug. Four JZP-110-treated subjects with MDD reported SAEs: cellulitis (100 to 300 mg/day), aggravated depression (200 mg/day), aggravated depression and suicidal ideation (400 mg/day), and myocardial infarction (200 mg). The myocardial infarction was the only SAE that was classified as possibly related to study drug (see the JZP- 110 I nvestigators Brochure for 
additional information on this SAE).  
In addition, there were reports of mostly mild cardiovascular AEs in other studies (see the 
JZP-110 Investigators Brochure for additional information). Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238171] 9603-[ADDRESS_1218109] in each of the Y[LOCATION_006]IC -9603 and Y[LOCATION_006]IC-9702- 01 studies  and in three subjects in the 
MDD-201 study (which includes the myocardial infarction  described above) . Ventricular

 ectopy (seen on 12- lead ECG) was repo rted in one patient in Y[LOCATION_006]IC-9702-[ADDRESS_1218110] degree AV block, about equally common in JZP-110 and controls, and rarely new and sustained. These were usually considered not clinically significant findings or adverse events.  
Three healthy subjects (two on 200 mg and one on 800 mg JZP-110) and two subjects with 
MDD (both on 500 mg JZP-110) had treatment- emergent reversible elevations of liver 
enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase) of 1.1 to 4.1 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). Two placebo- treated subjects also  developed mild elevations in 
liver enzymes. There were no other findings in laboratory safety tests.  
1.[ADDRESS_1218111] in the 150 or 300 mg treatment arms is 
anticipated to benefit. It is not known if the 75 mg dose will provide a clinical benefit. Placebo is not anticipated to provide any benefit; however, s ome patients receiving placebo 
might benefit from their participation in the study.  
The risks to subjects in this study who are randomized to the 150 mg or 300 mg treatment arms are expected to be similar to those seen in prior clinical studies  that evaluated the 
effects of 150 mg and 300 mg JZP -110 in narcolepsy patients ( Section 1.3.3). It is not known 
if the [ADDRESS_1218112] been on the order of 
up to 5 beats per minute, up to 6 mmHg in systolic blood pressure, and up to 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pr essure.  In a recently completed thorough QT study, JZP-110 did not cause 
QT interval prolongation above the threshold of regulatory concern when given at either the 300 mg or 900 mg dose (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] E14 Clinical Evaluat ion of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-
Antiarrhythmic Drugs, 2005).

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
The Schedule of Events is presented in Appendix 1, and the Study Schema in Figure  1. 
This trial is a 12 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, 
4 treatment parallel group study of the safety and efficacy of JZP -110 in the treatment of 
excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872151]-3 or the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Following the 
successful completion of Screening and Baseline visits, stratified randomization on the basis of the presence or absence of cataplexy will occur. Subjects will be assigned to receive 
JZP-110 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1218113] week of the Treatment Phase and will receive  300 mg 
starting  on Day 4. Subjects randomized to the 75 mg group will not require titration.  
During the Trea tment Phase, subjects will return to the investigative site to complete efficacy 
and safety assessments at the end of Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12; the Week 4 and 12 visits will include an overnight stay at the investigational site for nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG) 
followed by [CONTACT_872169] , and the Week [ADDRESS_1218114] 4 trials of a 5 trial,

5.1.2  Placebo  
Placebo tablets are composed of mannitol, MCC, and magnesium stearate, and a polymer 
film coat (Opadry®). Placebo tablets will be overencapsulated in the same opaque gelatin 
capsules that will be used for the active JZP-[ADDRESS_1218126] four trials of  the MWT by 9.5 and 12.8 minutes from baseline, 
respectively , and increased the sleep latency on the fifth trial of the MWT by 5.4 and 
8.2 minutes from baseline, respectively. Based on these findings and the safety and 
tolerability profiles of 150 and 300 mg JZP -110 in adult patients with narcolepsy in these 
trials, this study will further evaluate of the safety and efficacy of 150 and 300 mg, in addition to a lower dose of 75 mg JZP -110 given once a day in the morning.  
In this study, s ubjects will be rand omized 1:1:1:1 to receive either JZP-110 75, 150, 300 mg,

 The titration schedule in this protocol is based on the pharmacokinetics of the JZP-110 as 
well as the titration experience in clinical trials to date . Steady state levels of JZP -110 are 
reached within 3 days ( Section 1.3.1). In the previous ADX- N05 [ADDRESS_1218128] week of 
the Treatment Phase and will receive 300 mg starting on Day 4. This titration schedule is 
similar to those that were used in previous studies of JZP-110 in MDD ( Section 1.3.4). 
Although previous studies have shown that the [ADDRESS_1218129] week of the Treatment Phase 
and will receive 150 mg starting  on Day 4 to evaluate whether titration to the 150 mg dose in 
this study will result in fewer AEs as compared to a starting dose of 150 mg without titration . 
Subjects randomized to the 75 mg or placebo groups will not require titration.  
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Following the successful completion of Screening and Baseline visits, stratified randomization on the basis of the presence or absence of cataplexy will be used to assign 
subjects in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following four treatment groups: JZP -110 75, 150, or 
300 mg, or placebo. The investigator will access an Inter active Voice Response System 
(IVRS) or an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to randomize subjects.

5.8.2  Fluid and Food Intake  
Subjects will be instructed to take a single oral daily dose of study drug in the morning, on an 
empty stomach, within one hour of awakening. Subjects will also be instructed to abstain 
from eating or drinking (except water) for 30 min utes after taking the study drug.  Subjects 
will be encouraged not to increase caffeine use during the study. 
The day after the overnight stay at Weeks 4 and 12, study drug will be administered at the 
investigative site with approximately 240 mL wa ter (subjects may receive an additional 
240 mL of water if necessary).  
Subjects will also be given a light breakfast and light lunch at times indicated in the Schedule 
of Events ( Appendix 1) and Section s 7.2, 7.4, and  7.7. On days when blood samples for 
clinical laboratory tests are drawn, the blood samples will be drawn prior to breakfast (i.e., fasting). On visits for Weeks [ADDRESS_1218133] sh ould be served approximately 
30 minutes after dosing and should be consumed within 15-20 minutes. Caffeine consumption will not be allowed during the Baseline and Week 4 and 12 visits.  
5.8.3  Other  Restrictions

Regulatory authorities may check the existence of the signed ICF in this central study folder.  
6.2 Demographics 
Demographic information will be collected at Screeni ng (Visit 1) as permitted by [CONTACT_238235]. Demographics will include the date the subject signed the informed 
consent, and the subject’s age (as indicated by [CONTACT_156241], month and year of birth, year of 
birth, or age at screening), sex, ethnicity, and race.   
6.[ADDRESS_1218139] will be collected during the Screening Phase. The information will include, but is not limited to, symptoms of narcolepsy (current and past, including symptoms experienced prior to any narcolepsy treatment); conc omitant medication 
use; any medications used for the treatment of narcolepsy since diagnosis; any prior reaction 
to drugs; history and treatment (if any) of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, immunologic, neurologic, or psychiatri c disease; reproductive status; and 
confirmation of relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any updates to the medical history 
will be assessed at the Baseline Visit.   
6.4 Physical Examination

 A minimum of 2 blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be taken, and the 
measurements should be separated by [CONTACT_3450] 5 minutes. If the re is >[ADDRESS_1218141] and second blood pressure measurement (systolic or diastolic reading), an additional measurement should be taken ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_116281]. 2005). Vital signs will 
be recorded on the CRF. 
The mean of the two or three blood pressure assessments taken at the Screening visit will be 
used to meet entrance criteria to the study . Body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood 
pressure and pulse will be obtained on admission to the site the evenings before the PSG 
nights at Baseli ne and the end of Weeks 4 and 12; at Week 8; and at the Follow -up visit or at 
Early Termination . 
On the Baseline MWT day  (Day -1), body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and 
pulse measurements will be taken approximately 30 minutes after awakening (prior to the 
start of the MWT). Blood pressure and pulse will also be taken approximately 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 
and 11 hours after awakening. 
On MWT days at the end of Weeks 4 and 12 (or Early Termination if PSG/MWT  is 
performed), body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, and pulse will be taken 
approximately 1 hour before dosing (shortly before the first MWT trial) . Blood pressure and 
pulse will be taken at approximately 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (approximately [ADDRESS_1218142] MWT trial)  hours after dosing. The schedule of assessment for vital 
signs  during PSG/MWT visits  is described in Section [ADDRESS_1218143] is in his/her own environment. Subjects will 
undergo 24-hour blood pressure monitoring after discontinuation of excluded  medication (at 
least 5 half -lives) during the Screening Period and at Week 8. Blood pressure and pulse 
readings taken at [ADDRESS_1218144] 5 minutes. 
ECG s will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and at every clinic visit. The schedule of 
ECG assessment is described in Section 7 and Appendix 2. 
6.8 Polysomnography (PSG) 
A PSG followed by a n MWT will be performed at Baseli ne and at Weeks 4 and 12 (or Early 
Termination if the subject is willing and able to take study drug for the assessments) . If a 
subject is allowed to be rescreened, a repeat PSG and MWT will not be required if the results of the previous PSG and MWT in the study meet the current inclusion/exclusion criteria  and 
there have been no changes to medical history or concomitant medications that would likely affect the MWT results .

recorded, methods, and a scoring appendix. Oxygen saturation will be monitored according to the study center’s standard procedures. Standard PSG parameters will be reco rded. All 
polysomnographic data will be read by a central reader.  
An experienced sleep technologist must be present to monitor the PSG during PSG nights. 
6.9 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
At the Screening Visit, the Baseline/ Screening Version  of the C- SSRS will be administered 
to subjects to exclude any individuals with active suicidal ideation or behavior  
(Appendix 10). The C -SSRS is a  widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior . The 
instrument reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously attempted 
suicide and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an  impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011).  Suicidal ideation will be assessed for 
lifetime and over the past [ADDRESS_1218146] 5 years with  the Baseline/Screening Version of the C -SSRS. The Since Last 
Visit Version of the C -SSRS will be administered to subjects at every clinic visit after their 
Screening Visit including the Baseline and Follow-up visits  (Appendix 12). 
6.10 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.10.1  Laboratory Parameters  
Subjects will be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526]. Screening labs may be repeated one time.  Clinical laboratory tests to be conducted are listed in Table  1. 
The clinical laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory. An authorized back-up laboratory, as indicated on the Form FDA  1572 or equivalent, may be used if necessary as an 
emergency laboratory. The investigator will supply Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee with the back -up laboratory’s current licensure and laboratory reference ranges.   
Please note exclusionary clinical laboratory parameters listed in the exclusion criteria  
(Section 4.3). In addition, any laboratory parameter that is out of range and considered 
clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_093]) at the end of treatment must be re -
evaluated. The investigator will provide an explanation of all clinically significant 
observations. These findings will be reported as adverse events. 
At Screening, the investigator will calculate the estimated creatinine clearance rate using the 
Cockcroft- Gault formula (FDA Guidance for Industry. Pharmacokinetics in Patients with 
Impaired Renal Function – Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and Labeling, May 1998).  
 
CLcr (mL/min)  = [140 – age (years) ] x weight (kg) x (0.85 if female)   
                                                72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)  
 If serum creatinine is reported in µmol/L , the value should be divided by 88.4 for conversion 
to mg/dL.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Test Samples  
The laboratory will supply detailed instructions and all containers for blood and urine 
investigations. Blood and urine sample volumes will meet the laboratory’s specifications. The actual time of blood collection for all samples will be recorded.  
Blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry tests will be collected while the subject is fasting at Screening  (or Rescreening)  and Week 12 or Early Termination. If the Baseline 
visit occurs outside of the screening window (i.e., >29 da ys after the Screening Visit ), 
hematology and serum chemistry tests  should be collected  at the Baseline visit and may be 
drawn with the subject fasting or nonfasting. Table 2 shows the schedule for collection of 
blood and the total estimated blood volume to be collected during the study. 
Urine samples for urinalysis will be collected at Screening  (or Rescreening)  and Week 12 or 
Early Termination.  A repeat urinalysis should be obtained if the Baseline visit occurs outside 
of the screening window (i.e., >29 days after the Screening Visit ). 
A urine sample for urine drug screen will be obtained at every clinic visit except at the 
Follow-up visit. Samp les collected at Screening  (or Rescreening) , Baseline, and Week 12 (or 
Early Termination) will be analyzed. Samples collected at other visits may be analyzed at the 
investigator’s discretion.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood Samples for Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis  
Blood samples to measure plasma JZP -[ADDRESS_1218151] as described in Table 2 and Section  6.13.1. These b lood samples will be 
drawn within the time windows indicated in Section 6.13.1 and dispensed into labeled 
K2EDTA tubes. The actual time of blood collection for all samples will be recorded  on the 
CRF . The blood samples will be collected and processed according to the PK lab manual 
provided to the sites, and the plasma samples will be shipped to the bioanalytical laboratory 
on dry ice as directed by [CONTACT_156239] . 
The bioanalysis will be performed by a central bioanal ytical laboratory.  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug 
Study drug will be dispensed to subjects at the end of the Baseline visit and at the end of the 
Week 1, 4, and 8 visits or at alternative intervals if necessary to comply with State and local 
laws and regulations . Subjects will be instructed to begin  daily dosing with the new supply of 
study drug the day after the completion of the Baseline, Week 1, Week 4, and Week 8 visits. Subjects will a lso be provided with dosing instructions consistent with the restrictions 
described in Section 5.8. On the day after the overnight PSG and on the morning of the 
MWT at Weeks 4 and 12 (or Early Termination if PSG/MWT is performed) , study drug will 
be administered by [CONTACT_872173] [ADDRESS_1218152] (MWT)  
The MWT is the standard objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment ( Doghramji et al. 1997, Mitler et al. 1982, AASM 2014 ). A five -trial, 
40 m inute MWT will be performed  at Baseline and at the Week  4 and 12 visits (or Early 
Termination if the subject is willing and able to take study drug for the assessments) on the 
morning after an overnight PSG according to a standard protocol, which will be provided in a manual to each site.  
Each MWT during the study should be started at approximately the same time  of the day. 
During the MWT trials, s ubjects should be seated in bed in a darkened room with their back

Data from the MWT should be recorded and saved electronically, and any technician notes 
should also be maintained for potential transfer to Jazz Pharmaceuticals  at the end of t he 
study.  
6.12.2  Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire with [ADDRESS_1218156] how likely 
they would be to doze off or fall asleep in different situations. Responses range from 0 = would never doze to 3 = high chance of dozing ( Appendix 6). Subjects will be asked to 
complete the ESS with regard to the level of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_770646] 7 days  
at the Baseline and Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination). It provides a measure 
of a person’s general level of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], or their average sleep propensity in daily life. The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sens itivity for assessing 
subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156136] ( Johns 1991, 2000, Broderick et al. 2013).   
6.12.3  Clinician Global Impression of Severity (CGIs)  
The CGIs is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used assessment in clinical 
psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness ( Appendix 13). The responses of this 
investigator -completed scale range from 1 = normal, no signs of illness to 7 = among the 
most extremely ill patients. The Investigator will rate his/her impression of the severity of the 
subject’s current condition at B aseline relative to his/her experience with this patient 
population.

6.12.6  Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire Short Version (FOSQ -10) 
The FOSQ is a 30 -item disease specific quality of life questionnaire to determine functional 
status in adults; measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872153]  (Weaver et al . 1997). The FOSQ -10 is a short version of 
the original 30- item FOSQ that has been shown to perform similarly to the longer version 
(Chasens et al . 2009). The FOSQ -[ADDRESS_1218159] -treatment differences that are highly correlated with the longer 
version (Chasens et al . 2009). Subjects will complete the FOSQ -10 at the Baseline and 
Week  1, 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 7). 
6.12.7  36-Item Short Form Health S urvey Version 2 (SF-36v2 ) 
The SF -36v2 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 
8-scale profile of functional health and well -being scores as well as psychometrically -based 
physical and mental health summary measures and a preference -based health utility index 
(Hays & Stewart  1992, Ware & Sherbourne 1992). Subjects will complete the SF -36v2 at the 
Baseline and Week 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 8). 
6.12.8  EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that 
includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and an EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) (EuroQol 
Group, 2013). It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides 
a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D- 5L 
includes five levels of severity for each of the 5 dimensions of the descriptive system and was developed to improve the instrument’s reliability and sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects. Subjects will complete the EQ -5D- 5L at  the Baseline and Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 visits 
(or Early Termination) ( Appendix 9).  
6.12.9  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific  Health 
Problem V2.0 (WPAI:SHP)  
The WPAI :SHP  questionnaire is a 6-item self -administered questionnaire that measures work 
time missed and work and activity impairment because of a specified health problem during 
the past 7  days. The WPAI:SHP will be used with “narcolepsy” as the specified health 
problem. The validity of the WPAI has been established in a number of diseases 
(Reilly  et al. 1993). Subjects will complete the WPAI:SHP at the Baseline and Week 1, 4, 8, 
and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 11).

 6.12.10  Cataplexy Diary  
Subjects who experience cataplexy will complete a daily cataplexy frequency diary 
(Appendix 3) to record the occurrence and number of cataplexy attacks that they had each 
day beginning after discontinuation of narcolepsy medication  and throughout the 12- week 
Treatment Phase of the study . The study staff will review the diary at each study visit and 
discuss it with the subject at each phone contact.

JZP-110 studies to establish a population PK model. This approach is expected to permit 
characterization of the JZP-110 PK profile , specifically in the narcolepsy patient population. 
6.14 Adverse Event Reporting 
6.14.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure.  
Adverse events include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, 
or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug interaction; and/or (5) abnormal clinically significant laboratory values.  
• Symptoms of the underlying medical condition of narcolepsy  are not considered as 
adverse events unless there is an exacerbation  of the symptoms from baseline. 
• During the study, clinically significant adverse changes in  ECGs, routine laboratory 
tests, and physical examinations are considered AEs. Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE.

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_1218162], without asking about the occurrence of any  
specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs/symptoms,  should be documented as the AE.  
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_238238], must be documented in the subject’s 
medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice,  and on the 
AE CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , seriousness, and causal 
relationship to the study drug or procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity  Assessment 
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_27414], moderate, or severe as defined  
below. When the severity  of the AE changes over time, the change in severity  will be  
recorded  on the AE CRF as a new AE , and the original AE will stop when the new AE starts. 
Mild  Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given. 
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities is  influenced; treatment for symptom(s) may 
be needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) causes severe discomfort; symptom(s) incapacitate or 
significantly affect subject’s daily life; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].

An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per Title [ADDRESS_1218163] also be entered on the AE CRF. 
• Is fatal (results in death)  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability, defined as substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions

 • Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above   
− Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition 
of an SAE.  
− Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product [for EU sites only; EMA Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP) Module VI] 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_872154]:

• It is elective in nature and not related to worsening of an underlying condition 
 
Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176]. If a complication prolongs the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
 
“In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99325], for any length of time. Emergency room care without admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156158]. 
 
Overdose, medication errors, and drug misuse of the study drug are SAEs only if any of the seriousness criteria are met. Details of signs and symptoms, clinical manag ement, and 
outcome should be reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug or procedure is required. 
The relationship or association of the study drug or procedure in causing or contributing to 
the AE will be characterized using the following classification and criteria:

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_1218164]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , or accident.   
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following 
instances of clinical evidence: 
• Follows a known or suspected response pattern to the 
study drug or procedure . 
• Is confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_238179] (dechallenge).  
• Reappears upon repeated exposure (rechallenge) if 
medically appropriate.  
There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure 
caused the event —i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. In such case, the AE is considered an adverse reaction  
(AR). A suspected  AR has a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than an AR. 
Not 
Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure Event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event. 
A reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study drug or 
procedure caused the event is lacking.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Immediately Reportable Experiences  
The following immediately reportable experiences may occur during participation in this 
clinical trial and must be entered on the AE CRF and SAE Report form and reported within 
[ADDRESS_1218165] or designee: 
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with a 3-fold or 
greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in addition to an elevation of 
serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN , with no other identifiable etiology 
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1218166]  
 
As with other SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]), immediately reportable experiences must be reported 
on the SAE Report f orm, which should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by

The investigator must report to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee all AEs that occur during 
the study from the time written informed consent is obtained until the final study visit or early termination, regardless of their relationship to study drug or procedure. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically significant laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first. AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, or the subject is lost to follow up. If resolved, a resolution date should be provided, and for SAEs, a follow- up SAE Report form must be submitted 
indicatin g the resolution date. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up 
includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE. This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_1218171]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment 
is necessary for the immediate medical management of the subject or to ensure subject safety 
in the trial. In the case of an immediate medical em ergency, an Investigator or his/her 
designee will be able to unblind a subject at any time via the IVRS. Every attempt should be made to contact [CONTACT_238241] a subject as long as this does not compromise the safety of the subject. If a request for unblinding is received from an Investigator, the Medical Director/Medical Monitor will discuss with the Investigator the rationale for the request. If the treatment assignment is unblinded, then any broken blinding code mu st be clearly justified and explained by a comment in the source 
documentation, along with the date on which the code was broken and the identity of the person authorizing the unblinding. In addition, the study biostatistician will document the occurrence of investigator- initiated unblinding in the section of “Documentation of Statistical 
Method” in the final study report. Subjects for whom the blind is broken will be withdrawn from the study. 
If the request for unblinding is related to the occurrence of an  SAE, all procedures for the 
reporting of an SAE must be followed ( Section 6.14). The blinded SAE will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_872174] a potential safety concern for the individual subject or the other subjects in the study.  
6.[ADDRESS_1218172] states that he/she wants to stop participating in the study.  
The investigator, Jaz z Pharmaceuticals or its designee may remove a subject from the study 
at any time and for any reason.  
If any of the following criteria are met during the study, study drug administration must be 
stopped and the subject discontinued from the study: 
• Suicide risk reported or assessed by C- SSRS 
• 3-fold or greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by [CONTACT_238243]  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_1218173]  
• Creatin ine ≥2 mg/dL  
• Positive urine drug screen 
• Positive pregnancy test  
• Subject demonstrates a QTc value above 500 msec  (determinations should be based on at 
least two ECG recordings performed in close temporal proximity)  
• Subject experiences a serious a dverse event that is  considered  related to study drug  or 
procedure

For all subjects who prematurely discontinue, an attempt should be made to perform all early termination assessments (same assessments as those performed at the final study visit). Subjects should be asked to return [ADDRESS_1218174] withdraws informed consent, the specific reason for 
withdrawing the informed consent should be stated. 
Adverse events resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determination of outcome as ascertained by [CONTACT_093] (and/or Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee). The data will be recorded on the CRF.  
6.15.[ADDRESS_1218175] or at the investigator’s 
discretion, the investigator will record the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant CRF page and notify Jazz Pharmaceuticals  immediately. All subjects who terminate from the 
study early should undergo final study visit assessments indicated in Section 7.9. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject who terminated because of an AE, 
abnormal laboratory test, or ECG finding. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake safety foll ow-up procedures. 
6.15.2  Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Termination of Study  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  
Such a termination must be implemented by [CONTACT_093], if instructed to d o so by [CONTACT_156255] a time frame that is compatible with the subject’s well-being. 
 
6.16 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The MWT is a validated objective measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period 
of time and is particularly useful fo r determining efficacy of treatment  (Doghramji et al. 
1997, Mitler et al. 1982). The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity 
for assessing subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156136] ( Johns 1991, 2000;  Broderick et al. 2013). 
Additionally, t he CGIc , PCIc , SF-36v2, FOSQ -10, EQ-5D- 5L and the WPAI:SHP have been 
used extensively in clinical trials  to assess efficacy and quality of life. 
Sparse samples ([ADDRESS_1218176]) are being drawn at various time points following drug administration to use a population approach to characterize the PK profile of JZP -[ADDRESS_1218177] been selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are routinely used to assess the safety profile of d rugs in clinical studies and pertinent to known risks of JZP-110.

8 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The study will be conducted according to GCP guidelines and according to national law. 
Quality Assurance audits may be performed at the discretion of Jazz Pharmaceuticals.  
9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS   
9.1 General Considerations 
All study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846]. Categorical variables  will be reported as frequency and percent (e.g., gender, race). Continuous variables 
will be reported as number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum (e.g., age, weight).
 All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual subject data 
listings described below will be completed using Version 9.3 or later of th e SAS Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).  
9.2 Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 administered once 
daily for up to 12 weeks in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_872140].  To address this  
objective , pairwise treatment difference between each of the 3 doses and placebo will be 
tested.  The family -wise error rate will be control led at a significance level  of 0.05. To 
address the multiplicity issue due to the multiple efficacy  endpoints and doses, a fixed 
hierarchical testing sequence will be employed ( Section  9.10).

9.6 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
For the analysis of the co -primary efficacy  parameter  of MWT and ESS, the key secondary 
efficacy parameter of  PGIc , and secondary efficacy parameter of CGIc, multiple imputation 
methods will be used to impute the missing data in order to assess the sensitivity of the results.  These methods will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
The assumptions important to the validity of these imputation methods will be examined and discussed in the final study report where the sensitivity analysis is presented.

baseline value of the efficacy endpoint , and randomization stratification factor . SAS 
procedure PROC MIXED will be used to carry out this analysis. All available data will be included in the model. An unstructure d covariance matrix will be used to model the 
correlation among repeated measurements. The estimates of treatment difference versu s 
placebo and their 95% confidence intervals will be presented. In addition to the MMRM model, an analysis of covariance (ANCO VA) model will be used to analyze MWT and  ESS  
to provide sensitivity analyses. This ANCOVA model will include the effect for treatment as a fixed effect, and baseline value of the efficacy endpoint as the covariate.  
The chi -squared test will be used to test the hypotheses associated with the analysis of the 
key secondary efficacy endpoint of P GIc and the secondary efficacy endpoint of CGIc  at

9.12 Safety Analys es 
Safety analyses will be performed for the Safety Analysis Population. No formal statistical testing will be performed for the safety analyses.  
9.12.1  Adverse Event s 
Adverse events will be coded usi ng the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system 
to classify events under primary system organ class and preferred term.  
The number and percent of subjects who experienced TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, or SAEs; who died during the study; or who discontinued study drug or withdrew from the study due to an AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Results will be presented by [CONTACT_6657]. The overview will also report TEAEs by [CONTACT_764].  
A TEAE is defined as an AE th at either began after first study drug dose or worsened after 
the first dose. When determining the percent of subjects who experience an AE, multiple increases in severity are only counted as one AE. For example, a subject who develops a mild headache after the first study drug dose (that was not present during screening or at baseline), which subsequently worsens to moderate, then severe, is only counted once under the preferred term of headache. The increase in severity will be accounted  for in the maximum 
severity analysis.  
For all AE summaries, if a subject has more than one AE within a preferred term, the subject is counted only once at the maximum severity and with the closest relationship to study drug. If a subject has more than one AE within a syste m organ class, the subject is similarly 
counted once when reporting results for that system organ class. 
All AE data will be listed. The information presented will include subject number, treatment, 
primary system organ class and preferred term, date of on set, severity, relationship to study 
drug, action taken, and stop date (if available).

b If the Baseline visit occurs outside of the screening window (i.e. >29 days  after the Screening Visit ), obtain blood samples for serum chemistry , 
hematology  tests and a urine sample for urinalysis.  Record if  the subject was fasting or nonfasting at the time of the collection. 
c Samples collected at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12 or Early Termination will be analyzed . Samples collected at other visits may be analyzed at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
d These assessments are not required for subjects who are withdrawing early from the study and are unable or unwilling to take additional study drug to 
complete a final PSG/MWT.  
e For subjects who are being rescreened, a repeat PSG and MWT is not required at Visit 2 if  the results of the previous PSG and MWT meet the current 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  and there have been no changes to medical history  or concomitant medications  that would likely affect the MWT results

(FOSQ) 
Some people have difficulty performing everyday activities when they feel tired or sleepy.  The 
purpose of this questionnaire is to find out if you generally have difficulty carrying out certain

Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any intent/desire to die associated with the  act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt.  There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an atte mpt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g ., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?

Were you trying to end your life when you _____?

have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather  than an interrupted 
attempt. Shooting: Person has gun poin ted toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and tak en down from ledge.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types ) Since Last 
Visit 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done any thing to harm yourself?   
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, g et 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior witho ut suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_156279]) from starting the potentially self -injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather  than an interrupted  attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger . Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grab bed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0  
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medica l damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with on coming train but pulled away 
before run over).  
 
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injur y 
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death

A. The patient has daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into 
sleep occurring for at least three months.  
B. The presence of one or both of the following: 
1. Cataplexy (as defined under Essential Features) and a mean sleep latency of 
≤8 minutes and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) on an 
MSLT performed according to standard techniques. A SOREMP (within 15 
minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogram may 
replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT. 
2. CSF hypocretin-1 concentration, measured by [CONTACT_270069], is either 
≤110 pg/mL or <1/[ADDRESS_1218293] three months.  
B. A mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes and two or more sleep onset REM periods 
(SOREMPs) are found on a MSLT performed accord ing to standard techniques. A 
SOREMP (within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal 
polysomnogram may replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT. 
C. Cataplexy is absent.  
 D. Either  CSF hypocretin -1 concentration has not been measured or  CSF hypo cretin -
1 concentration measured by [CONTACT_872185] > 110 pg/mL or  > 1/3 of 
mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same standardized assay.2 
E. The hypersomnolence and/or MSLT findings are not better explained by [CONTACT_872186], obstructive sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase disorder, or 
the effect of medication or substances or their withdrawal.  
Notes  
1. If cataplexy develops later, then the disorder should be reclassified as narcolepsy type 1. 
2. If the CSF Hcrt-1 concentration is tested at a later stage and found to be either ≤ 110 
pg/mL or < 1/3 of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same assay, then the 
disorder should be reclassified as narcolepsy type 1.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization ICHE6), the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 parts 803 and 812, and other 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
 
1.1.1 Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure 
 
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is usually defined as death from a cardiac etiology within an hour of 
the onset of symptoms in a person who otherwise appeared in a stable clinical state. These deaths are often attributed to a cardiac arrhythmia, of which ventricular fibrillation is the most common.  
In the [LOCATION_002], SCD is the leading cause of death accounting for nearly 350,[ADDRESS_853747] heart failure (HF) have been shown to have a higher risk of SCD. 
Among patients with HF, those with ventricular dysfunction as evidenced by a lower left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) have a particularly high risk of SCD. 
Over one million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638356] a related cause.2 Within the 
Veterans Affairs Health Care System, mortality after discharge has declined but remains 
significant (over 10% at [ADDRESS_853748]-discharge in 2006), and re-admission rates have trended 
higher (over 6% at 30 days in 2006).3 Similar data has been reported among Medicare recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].4 
Sudden cardiac death may account for half of the cardiovascular mortality experienced.5,6   
 
 
1.1.2 Treatment of SCD in Heart Failure Patients  
Implantable cardioverter -defibrillators (ICDs) have been shown to reduce both arrhythmic and 
total mortality in stable heart failure patients7 with significant ventricular dysfunction. However, 
according to the ACCF/AHA guidelines ICDs for primary prevention HF patients should not be 
considered until optimal guideline-directed medical therapy ( GDMT ) has been achieved, with a 
minimum of 3 to 6 months of appropriate medical therapy8,9.  Since stability in heart failure is

high risk commonly does not meet GDMT  guideline standards.  
Another method of SCA risk protection frequently used after HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638358] (WCD).[ADDRESS_853749] been titrated into appropriate doses and the EF has been given time to recover, 
the WCD can be removed and an assessment for ICD implantation due to permanent SCD risk 
can be performed.  
 
1.2 Preclinical Data  
 
NA 
 
1.3 Clinica l Data to Date  
 
Previous clinical data reveals  that the following questions remain controversial subjects in newly 
diagnosed HF patients:  
 1) How long does it take to achieve optimal medical therapy ?, and therefore,  
 2) W hen to implant an ICD in a newly diagnosed patient?, and  
 3) How often and when to measure EF recovery ? 
Titration to therapeutic levels is generally not achieved within three months of initiation11,12 for 
some drugs known to improve ventricular dysfunction, and improvements in heart failure symptoms and ventricular dysfunction may occur after optimization of medical therapy over time.  
A recent retrospective study of Medicare patients linked to the National Cardiovascular Data ICD Registry showed a very low rate of guideline-directed medical therapy being achieved in the 90 
days before ICD implantation
13. Only 61.1% had filled their prescriptions for a HF beta-blocker 
plus an angiotensin-converting enzym e inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker at least once 
during the 90 days before ICD implantation, and only 28.3% had a supply for ≥80% of the [ADDRESS_853750]  likely to receive guideline-directed medical therapy. Death within one year occurred more 
frequently in those patients not receiving any guideline-directed medical therapy even after adjusting for patient characteristics, HF severity, and comorbidities.  
Although EF is typi[INVESTIGATOR_638359], and usually at some follow -up period, it is 
unknown how often EF should be measured and what “recovery” of LV dysfunction means in terms of outcomes.  The IMAC -2 study looked at myocardial recovery in new ly diagnosed NICM

IMAC -2 study, the DEFINITE study excluded reversible cardiomyopathies, which may explain the 
lower recovery rate seen in DEFINITE patients.  
1.4 Study Device  
 
1.4.1 Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator (WCD)  
To date, several studies have demonstrated the impact WCD’s have had in successfully resuscitating patients from ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  In fact, the first shock termination 
success of 98% for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias and the 94% survival to conscious 
emergency room arrival is far superior to any other form of outpatient resuscitation. The highest 
rates of survival from SCA secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (53%) are reported to be in 
casinos16 owing to the rapid defibrillation afforded by [CONTACT_638370] 
(surveillance is constant) and c lose availability of defibrillators. Since no witness is required for a 
WCD to detect and defibrillate, when a WCD is worn it provides outpatient defibrillation faster than 
that afforded from constant, close human observation. 
Wearable defibrillators have shown great success  in treating SCA17,18,19. However, the data 
confirming the overall impact of WCD by [CONTACT_638371]20. As the device is 
being used routinely in some centers for selected high- risk HF patients after discharge, a 
prospective study is warranted to confirm that the WCD benefits these patients, both in terms of 
SCD protection and by [CONTACT_638372].

2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective(s)  
 
The primary objective of this study is to observe the rate of recovery of ventricular function 
(EF>35%) between [ADDRESS_853754] 90 days, w e hypothes ize that an 
additional 5-10% of patients will experience EF improvement between 90 and 180 days as GDMT  
is achieved.  This would be considered clinically significant in terms of the potentially avoided ICD 
implantations. Outcomes will be tracked and report ed for three pre-specified groups based on 
assessment of SCD risk at 90 days of WCD use:  
1) Patient improved (EF >35%), SCD risk deemed to be negligible. These patients are 
expected to end WCD use and not receive an ICD .   
2) Patient improved EF from start of WCD use  (a positive change of at least 5 percentage 
points in EF), or has a borderline EF of 30-35% , but still has continued SCD risk (EF ≤ 
35%). These patients are expected to continue to use the WCD for an additional 3 months.  
3) Patient not improved from s tart of WCD use (no change or worsening of EF),  EF<30% 
and has continued high SCD risk. Those on GDMT are expected to be evaluated for an 
ICD.  Those not yet on GDMT may continue the WCD for an additional 90 days. 
2.2 Secondary Objective(s)  
 
The specif ic secondary objectives are to: 
2.2.1 Observe the incidence and etiology of SCA  and all sustained VT/VF arrhythmias  during 
WCD use.

2.3 Safety Objective(s)  
 
The safety  objectives will be to compare complications from extended use of the WCD with those 
of the ICD during the study timeframe.  
 
2.4 Additional Objective(s)  
 
Echocardiogram  core lab determinations will be used to verify local estimates of EF and may be 
used in secondary analyses of the study data.  
 
[ADDRESS_853756] the hypothesis that additional EF recovery  occurs between 90 
and 180 days as GDMT  is achieved.  Although the study doesn’t start until day 90, all eligible, 
consenting patients will be entered into a registry at the start of WCD use.  The pre- study registry 
will allow us to collect early  (90 day) outcomes  and data in those patients who are likely to be 
eligible for the study  at day 90, or are eligible, but refuse the study at day 90. 
 3.1.1 Randomization 
Because WCD’s have b een shown to be very effective at treating potentially lethal ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias and are already FDA -approved and CE marked for use in the study 
population, randomization will not be done. This observational study will gather information on 
impro vement in EF with medical therapy, WCD use, sudden cardiac arrest event rates, and 
outcomes within a select group believed to be at high risk for SCD.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  3.2 Primary Study Endpoints 
 
The primary objective of this study is to observe the rate of recovery of ventricular function 
(EF>35%) between 90 and 180 days in newly diagnosed HF with reduced EF patients  being 
treated with GDMT . The primary endpoints that will be used to support the primary objective are 
1) the degree to which GDMT  has been achieved, and 2) rates of EF recovery  at pre-specified 
time-points  post WCD start . 
3.2.1  GDMT  
Medications  and self-reported adherence to taking those medications as prescribed will be 
recorded from chart review and patient interview if necessary at day  90, 120, 150, 180, 270, and 
360. Medications will also be recorded at the start and end of WCD use. 
 
GDMT  will be defined by [CONTACT_638375]/AHA/HFSA/ESC guideline-recommended 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as HF treatments with any renin-angiotensin inhibitor (angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) if ACE -I is not tolerated), and 
reaching target evidence-based doses (or the maximally tolerated levels) of beta-
blockers8,9.  Mineralocorticoid/aldosterone receptor antagonists (MRAs) are to be included along 
with ACE -I and beta-blocker treatments, and should be titrated to reach evidence-based doses 
(or the maximally tolerated levels). Further extension of medications according to current 
guidelines, including I f-channel inhibitor or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor will be 
considered additional HF therapy left to the discretion of the treating physician, but will not be 
required to define “optimal medical therapy”. 
 
3.2.2  LVEF recovery  
To support our primary hypothesis that an additional 5% of patients will experience EF 
improvement between 90-180 days, EF measurement for all patients at 90 (±14), 180 (±14)  and 
360 (±14) -days  after WCD start  will be requested and recorded. For this study, EF>35% will be 
considered as EF improved.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Echocardiographic assessment of LVEF is most common. Nevertheless, 
other imaging modalities (MUGA, MRI) may be used to document LVEF at day 0.  Although 
there are likely to be differences in EF assessment among enrolling sites and practices, 
these differences are not expected to affect the outcome of the trial. At a minimum, we will request a 2- D, M -mode echo at the scheduled time-points . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Echocardiogram core lab verification. EF  is commonly estimated by 
[CONTACT_6751]. Several studies have shown EF measurement to have a wide range of 
variability that can be observer dependent. Study echocardiograms will be sent to a core 
lab for a uniform determination of the EF. The core lab determinations will be used to verify 
local estimates of EF and may be used in secondary analyses of the study data 
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints 
 
The secondary endpoints are observational and include documentation of any SCA/SCDs, 
including any treatments by [CONTACT_638376], any untreated sustained ventricular arrhythmias 
that are recorded by [CONTACT_587951], and the mortality following discharge in HF patients. We will also 
collect economic and healthcare utilization data on all patients.

self-inflicted fatality in otherwise stable subjects who die within one hour of the onset of 
the terminal symptoms. Subjects dying more than one hour after a sudden cardiac arrest 
(SCA) from a ventricular arrhythmia will be designed as non- sudden death due to 
ventricular arrhythmia. For unwitnessed deaths participants will meet the definition of 
sudden cardiac death if they are found dead within 24 hours of being well, assuming there is no evidence of another cause of death during that time period. Autopsy results 
may be used when available.

The total number of WCD prescriptions  for the study is estimated to be 868, and assuming ~15% 
lost follow up, [ADDRESS_853776]  an EF measurement at day 90. The sample size was 
calculated using data-based estimates as described below. 
 
8.1.1 Statistical design used for sample size calculation 
 
 
 
 
This dataset will be used evaluate among all patients, if more than 5% of them will experience 
EF improvement between 90 and 180 days (n 5/n > 5%).  
   
To calculate the number of samples  (n), we first calculated 𝑛𝑛4, then calculated n based on the 
following formula: 
𝑛𝑛=𝑛𝑛4
𝑃𝑃 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 2∗1
𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤∗1
𝑃𝑃 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 1 
where 𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 is the percentage of patients who will wear WCD beyond 90 days  (n1/(n1+n2+n3), 
𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 1  and 𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 2 are the percentage of patients with proper follow up from 0 to 90 
days and from 90 days to 180 days respectively, both of the th em equals to 0.85 (1-
0.15=0.85).   
  
To calculate sample size for  n
4, we performed su periority test. The statistical hypothesis to be 
tested is:  
𝐻𝐻0:𝑃𝑃≤𝑃𝑃0+𝛿𝛿  vs 𝐻𝐻1:𝑃𝑃>𝑃𝑃0+𝛿𝛿 
 
The sample size of superiority test is calculated as the following formula:  
𝑛𝑛4=𝑝𝑝(1−𝑝𝑝)�𝑍𝑍1−𝛼𝛼+𝑍𝑍1−𝛽𝛽
𝑝𝑝−𝑝𝑝0−𝛿𝛿�[ADDRESS_853777] EF improvement (n5/n4). 𝑝𝑝0 is the 
baseline proportion, and specified as 0.001 (close to 0). δ is the test margin, since the 
hypothesis is that more than 5% of them will experience EF improvement between 90 and 180 days (n
5/n > 5%) , δ depends on 𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤  as 𝛿𝛿=0.05/𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤. We also specify α as 0.05, β as 
0.1.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  
ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION   
As shown in figure above, sample size (n ) depends both on p, the actual proportion of patients 
who will have EF improvement (p=n 5/n4) and 𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤, the percentage of patients who will wear 
WCD beyond 90 days  (𝑝𝑝𝑓𝑓𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤= n1/(n1+n2+n3)).In this study, we specify α as 0.05, β as 0.1.  We 
predict that about 1/[ADDRESS_853778] continued WCD wear from 90 to 180 days; and  actual 
proportion of WCD patients  at [ADDRESS_853779] further EF improvement is  23%. In this case, 
we plan to prescribe WCD to 8 68 patients  (initial registry sample size), in order to have 
approximately 738 patients eligible for the study at day 90. If mid-study analysis shows 
continued WCD use to be far out of 1/3, then sample size will be re-adjusted as necessary.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  When the number of patients in WCD group is around ~250, with an estimated rate of shock at 
1.5%, the probability of observing two or more events is more than 90%. When the number of 
patients in WCD group is around 200, with an estimated rate of shock at  1.5%, the probability of 
observing two or more events is ~80%.  
 
Sample size adjustment (mid-term analysis) : As both the dropout ratio prior to the registry  and 
the percentage of patients who will wear  the WCD beyond 90 days  were higher than predicted, 
the sample size for the registry and study were recalculated in this protocol revision (version C) .  
The final goal remains  to have 200-250 patients in the extended wear WCD group as determined 
in the preceding paragraph. 
 
 
8.2 Randomization Scheme 
 
Because WCD’s have been shown to be very effective at treating potenti ally lethal ventricular 
tachyarrhythmias and are already FDA -approved for use in the study population, randomization 
will not be done. 
8.3 Endpoint Assessment  
 
8.3.1  Primary Endpoint – LVEF recovery and GDMT  
Descriptive or summary statistics of serial EF measurements will be used to analyze the rate of recovery of ventricular dysfunction following discharge. For example, the means of EF at 180 days will be compared to the means of EF at baseline and 90 days.  The percentage of 
patients reaching the goal of EF>35% will be compared at 90 days and 180 days. Also, the 
time taken to reach EF>35% will be calculated for those who  improve, and compared 
between groups (based on baseline characteristics). Individual pati ent EF measurements 
over time will be compared to determine whether common patterns arise in certain groups of 
patients (fast recovery/slow recovery, plateaued recovery/peaked recovery followed by 
[CONTACT_638382]).The influence of baseline characteristics on the potential for recovery will be 
evaluated.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to assess the degree GDMT  was reached at 90 and 180 
days , and how GDMT  relates to EF recovery . We will also assess how adherence to the 
GDMT  regimen affects EF recovery and overall clinical improvement.  
 8.3.2   Secondary Endpoint- Treatments by [CONTACT_638383]’s 
principal investigator. All shocked events and terminal ECG recordings will be adjudicated 
by a committee independent of the sponsor.  
Effectiveness of the WCD in treating ventricular arrhythmias will be evaluated through 
descriptive means.  Clinical outcomes and device data from any defibrillation or cardiac 
event will be reviewed for success as defined by [CONTACT_638378], 
conversion out of the detected ventricular arrhythmia, and consciousness when medically 
evaluated after treatment.   
Descriptive statistics will be us ed to analyze the incidence of unnecessary shocks from 
WCD and ICD  in this population.  Causes of prolonged false detections and lack of 
response button use in WCD users will be reviewed.

unexpected, non-traumatic, non-self -inflicted fatality in otherwise stable subjects who die 
within one hour of the onset of the terminal symptoms. Subjects dying more than one hour 
after a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) from a ventricular arrhythmia will be designed as non-
sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia. For unwitnessed deaths participants will meet 
the definition of sudden cardiac death if they are found dead within 24 hours of being well, 
assuming there is no evidence of another cause of death during that time period. Autopsy results may be used when available. 
8.3.5  Secondary Endpoint- Incidence and etiology of other WCD recorded arrhythmias, 
such as asystole and sustained (≥ 30 seconds) supra-ventricular arrhythmias . 
Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the incidence of  non-VT/VF events  that are 
recorded by [CONTACT_587951].  Such arrhythmic events will be evaluated for correlation with the 
other endpoints.  ECG recordings will be adjudicated by a committee independent of the

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  The following events are commonly reported in patients having HF and therefore should not be 
reported unless deemed related to WCD wear: dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, edema, chest pain, 
and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.  
 
Common anticipated device effects that may be caused by [CONTACT_638385]: skin rash or 
irritation, sleeplessness due to WCD alarms occurring at night and inappropriate shocks , 
discomfort from the device.  
 10.1.[ADDRESS_853782] (UADE)  
 
An unanticipated adverse event is any adverse device effect not identified by [CONTACT_6073], severity or frequency prior to the investigation.  
 
If the frequency of inappropriate shocks exceeds [ADDRESS_853783].  
   
Any commonly reported adverse events in patients having HF, as mentioned above, should not 
be reported unless deemed to be related to WCD wear.  
10.2 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Device Effects 
 
10.2.1 Investigator Recording and Reporting 
 
The Investigators are responsible for recording and reporting all adverse device effects in the 
pertinent case report form  (CRF) . Adverse device effects must be reported to sponsor and 
reviewing IRBs per local reporting requirements.  
The Investigator must next assess the seriousness of the adverse device effect.  
Serious injury  
 
Serious adverse device effects include any injury or event that is:  
• Fatal or life -threatening, or  
• Requiring or prolonging hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
• Resulting in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body 
structure  
• Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or  permanent damage to a body structure 
 
The Investigator should also assess whether the adverse device effect is anticipated or 
unanticipated. 
 
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator must seek information on adverse device effects 
by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse device 
effects should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate 
adverse effect module of the CRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnor mal diagnostic 
procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.

ZOLL MEDICAL CORPORATION  All adverse device effects occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course 
of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse device effects that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outc ome.  Any 
serious adverse device effects that occur after the study period should be recorded and reported 
promptly .  
 
The minimum initial information to be captured in the subject’s source document concerning the 
adverse device effect includes:  
• Study identifier

(eCRFs) will be implemented within Clindex LIVE  by [CONTACT_633834]’s Clinical Dat a Manager.  Data will be 
entered at the investigational sites by [CONTACT_32341].  Entered data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_133052], who will affirm its accuracy and completeness by [CONTACT_633835]-off.  The capability 
of the Clindex LIVE  system to impl ement edit checks during the data entry process (front end edit 
checks) will be utilized to generate queries automatically at the time of data entry when 
malformed, out-of-bounds or missing required data are detected.  Back end edit checks will be 
run week ly, to capture data errors and omissions not amenable to front end edit checks, and data 
that does not pass these checks will be manually  queried .  Weekly manual review of entered data 
by [CONTACT_633834]’s Clinical Data Manager and Clinical Scientist will permit identification of any additional 
data issues, and data queries will be manually generated.  All data queries, whether automatically 
or manually generated, will be communicated to and cleared by [CONTACT_638388] , which provides a full featured query handling capability.  Center staff will either 
correct or affirm all data that generates queries, which keeps all data processing in the hands of

Paper CRFs will be available for recording patient data in the event that the data entry system 
becomes unavailable because of a technical failure.  All paper CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_638390].  Appropriately completed and signed paper CRFs may become the source data, and will be retained by [CONTACT_638391].  
Once the EDC system again becomes available, the patient data will be transcribed from the paper form into the EDC sy stem by [CONTACT_638392].   
 
The paper CRFs for this study are documented under 90D0109-CRF.  
 
The QOL CRF (90D0109-QOL) will be collected initially on  paper CRFs, and then entered into 
the EDC system by [CONTACT_30107].  
 12.2.2 Source  Documents  
 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are 
contained in source documents.  Examples  of these original documents, and data records include: 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at 
the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved in the clinical 
trial. 
 12.2.3 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System  
 
The Clindex LIVE  software system was selected for use for this clinical trial because of its full -
featured capability, security features, and wide acceptance within the clinical trial industry.  ZOLL’s Clinical Data Manager, in consultation with ZOLL’s Clinical Scientist, will implement the 
set of eCRFs in Clindex LIVE, and develop a set of test data.  User acceptance testing at ZOLL will demonstrate accurate and complete functioning of all data and edit check elements prior to 
rollout of the EDC system to the investigational sites.  The clinical database will be hosted at 
Fortress Medical Systems, LLC, using redundant on- and off-site resources, throughout the data 
collection process.  Data access (both entry and review) will be controlled by [CONTACT_633838].  Only users who have been appropriately trained will be permitted to perform data entry.  Once entered by [CONTACT_8786], data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_638393].  The Clindex LIVE  system features a fully 
documented audit trail on all CRF data modified after first pass entry and automatic audit trail on 
all data changes.  Individual report level security allows for a customized report environment for 
individual users and sites, so that users and sites may access only the data which they have 
entered into the system.  The Clindex LIVE  system has been independently certified to be 21 CFR 
Part 11 compliant.

13 Risks and Benefits 
 
Resuscitation success rates decline approximately 10% per minute of delayed defibrillation 
(Larsen MP, Eisenberg  MS, Cummins  RO, Hallstrom  AP. Predicting survival from out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_638366]: a graphic model . Ann Emerg Med.  1993; 22:1652– 1658. ). The LifeVest is designed 
to deliver defibrillation within one minute of syncopal VT/VF. Although emer gency medical service 
response times vary by [CONTACT_157478], the device is expected in general to defibrillate faster than the 
local emergency medical services response and possibly result in a better resuscitation success rate. Without LifeVest use, the patient is dependent on outpatient emergency medical services 
for treatment in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest. If the device is not worn, if the device fails 
to detect an epi[INVESTIGATOR_389988]/VF, or if having detected the arrhythmia it fails to convert the VT/VF, 
then the patient would again be dependent on emergency medical services. Prior investigations 
and current use indicate that the probability of an unnecessary shock epi[INVESTIGATOR_638367] 100 months of patient use 
9. The experience of an unnecessary shock may be painful and 
startling, but is not likely induce heart damage or arrhythmia. However, there is a small risk that 
an unnecessary shock will induce a fatal arrhythmia. Non-sustained VT following an inappropriate 
shock from a wearable cardioverter defibrillator has been observed in about 0.25% of 
inappropriate shocks (about one in 350 to 400 inappropriate shocks)22,23. 
If standard defibrillation is required on a patient wearing the device, the electrode belt should be 
unbuckled and the monitor disconnected. If the monitor is not disconnected prior to standard 
defibrillation, there is a possibility that some of the defibrillation current could be shunted through 
the electrodes. Although not directly harmful to the pat ient, such shunting might reduce the 
effectiveness of the rescue defibrillation. A warning label on the garment instructs emergency medical personnel to disconnect the system before using a standard defibrillator.  
14 Ethical Considerations

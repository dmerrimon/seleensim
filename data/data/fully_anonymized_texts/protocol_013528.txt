ptimizing PrEP Uptake and Adherence among Male Sex Workers using a Two-Stage 
Randomization Design 
You are being asked  to take part in a research study. All research studies at Lifespan hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421382], the [LOCATION_002] government and Lifespan. Before 
you decide whether to be in the study, you and the researcher will engage in the “informed consent” process. During this process, the researcher will explain the purpose of the study, how it will be carried out, and what you will be expected to do if you participate. The researcher will also explain the possible risks and benefits of being in the study, and will provide other information. You should feel free to ask any questions you might have. The purpose of these discussions is for you to decide whether participating in the study is the best decision for you. 
If you decide to be in the study, you will be asked to sign and date this form in front of the person who explained the study to you. This form summarizes the information you discussed. You will be given a copy of this form to keep. 
1.Nature and Purpose of the Study: You are bein g asked to take part in a research project because
you are a man who reports having exchanged sex for money or drugs with another man, you are 18years of age or older, and you are HIV -negative.
The purpose of this study is to determine if a program calle d “PrEPare for Work” will help make 
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) more effective in preventing HIV among men who exchange sex 
for money or drugs with another man, or male sex workers (MSWs). PrEP is a medication called Truvada that is taken daily to prevent HIV infection. This medication has been approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) for this purpose. In order to promote the effectiveness of PrEP, we are testing a program called PrEPare for Work to see how well it helps people s tay on PrEP once they start taking it.  
As part of this study you will be asked to sign a medical release so that your medical records regarding your PrEP treatment can be accessed for study purposes. Completion of this release is voluntary. 
We expect to enroll [ADDRESS_531667] Weber, and is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681].  IRB approval 2/28/201 9

2. Explanation of Procedures : If you take part in this study you will: 
 
1. Complete Stage 1 baseline survey about your age, sex, gender, HIV status, sexual 
behavior, and other basic information about you. After your baseline you will be randomly 
assigned to one of two interventions:  
 
 Group A Strength Based Case Management (SBCM) Intervention: Where 
you will meet with a trained case manager one on one t o help you obtain Truvada 
(from now on referred to as “PrEP pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]”) from The Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421383].  
 Group B Standard of Care: You will be provided with a referral to The Miriam 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421384]  
 
2. Your first clinical appointment at The Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421385]:  
 
 Blood drawing : You will be asked to provide a blood sample (two teaspoons) 
from a vein in your arm for laboratory tests. This blood sample will be used for 
testing for PrEP drug levels, HIV and other STDs. We may also collect urine 
samples and swabs from your rectum and throat to test for  STDs.  
 
 A review of your medical records including medical history, HIV testing, and 
other STD testing. If your results show that you are HIV -positive and/or infected 
with hepa titis B, you will not proceed to Stage 2 and you will be directly referred 
for treatment.  
 
 If you begin PrEP , as part of routine clinical care, you will see the doctor every 
three months for a check- up to look for any side effects and test you for HIV. In 
addition to any blood samples the doctor may take to test for HIV and side 
effects, we may request blood and hair samples to check for PrEP levels in your 
blood as part of the  study.  
 
3. Complete Stage [ADDRESS_531668] up to 
two months to begin treatment. You may complete up to two follow -up assessments (the 
first and second month after Stage 1 baseline), regardless of whether you decide to start 
taking  PrEP.  
Complete Stage 2 baseline survey (once you begin taking PrEP and complete 
randomization). We may request blood and hair samples to check for PrEP levels in your 
blood as part of the study. If you begin PrEP, you will be enrolled into Stage 2 and you will 
then be randomly assigned to one of two interventions . You will be offered a study cell 
phone to receive calls related to the study and you may choose to receive daily SMS text 
reminders from this phone if you are a part of the intervention. 
 
Intervention Groups:  
A. Group A PrEPare For Work Adherence Interventi on: You will come in up to 
three times for the PrEPare for Work sessions with a clinical interventionist and may 
receive daily SMS text messaging of personalized reminders to take PrEP as 
prescribed. Text messages will begin at stage two baseline and will end upon the 
Study Volunteer Initials  
RPO -Adult IC and Authorization –v.9-[ADDRESS_531669] visit. 
Audio recordings: all counseling sessions will be audio- recorded and 
will only be reviewed by [CONTACT_464]. This is to help insure that the 
interventions are designed well and improved upon as needed, and to 
insure that you receive the same level of care as all other study 
participants. Recordings may also be transcribed onto paper and reviewed 
to look at potential themes or concerns among participants, further 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_421386]. Names mentioned on the tape will 
be removed prior to analysis. Recordings wil l be identified by a study 
identification number only, and will be stored at Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421387] a secure, locked file cabinet and/or a password-  
protected folder on an electronic server. Recordings will be retained for 
seven years and t hen destroyed. You may elect not to have your sessions 
audio- recorded, and may still participate in the study. Additionally, you 
may ask to turn off the recorder at any point during the sessions.  
 
 Group B Standard of Care: as part of routine clinical care,  you will see the 
doctor every three months for a check -up to look for any side effects and test  you 
for HIV. In addition to any blood samples the doctor may take to test for HIV 
and side effects, we may request blood and hair samples to check for PrEP levels 
in your blood as part of the  study.  
 
4. Complete Stage [ADDRESS_531670] blood and hair 
samples to check for PrEP levels in your blood as part of the study. All participants in Stage 
2 will complete follow up  surveys.  
 
 Surveys may occur at The Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Brown University or Project Weber. 
However, blood and hair samples may only be conducted at The Miriam  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421388].  
 
Incentives : You may receive up to $210 for your participation. You will receive  $30 at each survey 
visit (Stage 1 baseline, Stage 1 one month follow up, Stage 1 two month follow up, Stage 2 
baseline, Stage 2 three -month follow up and Stage 2 six -month follow up). Individuals in the Stage 
one SBCM intervention will receive $[ADDRESS_531671] session. Individuals in the Stage 2 intervention 
condition who are randomized to the adherence intervention arm will also receive $15 USD 
compensation for each of the PrEPare for Work intervention sessions attended. The number of visits 
you will be asked to attend, and the amount you will be compensated, will vary based on the part of 
the study in which you are  participating.  
 
Costs for participating in this study : Some of the services you will receive are being performed only 
because you are partici pating in this research study. Examples of these “research only” services 
include blood tests at research visits, meetings with the case manager, PrEP adherence counseling  
Study Volunteer Initials  
RPO -Adult IC and Authorization –v.9-2018 
PrEP among MSWs  4 of 8 December 23 , 2018   
 and use of the study cell phone. Those services will be paid for by [CONTACT_421394].  
 
Other services you will receive during this research study are considered “routine clinical services” 
that you would have received even if you were not in the research study. Examples  are PrEP pi[INVESTIGATOR_421389], if you are eligible for PrEP. These services will be billed to your health 
insurance company, but you will be responsible for paying any deductibles, co- payments, or co-  
insurance that are a normal part of your h ealth insurance plan. If you do not have health insurance 
or cannot afford PrEP, the case manager will help you to find ways to pay for it. Additionally, if 
you elect to use your personal cell phone for any study related purpose including phone calls and 
text messages, standard rates will apply.  
 
 
Contact [CONTACT_7171]:  If you have any questions about the study or concerns about a possible 
research -related injury, you may contact [CONTACT_093], Philip A. Chan, MD, at 401- 793-2928.  
 
3. Discomforts and Risks  
• Risk of loss of privacy or confidentiality: As with any research study, participation in this 
study may involve a loss of privacy, but your information will be handled with maximum 
confidentiality. Participants in Stage [ADDRESS_531672] your text data from unauthorized access and to maint ain data accuracy to help 
ensure that your data is stored securely and remains  confidential  
• Risks of counseling: Some of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_421390]. You can always choose to not 
discuss a topic that is making you too upset. You may also request a referral for  additional 
mental health services should you feel you need evaluation or  treatment.  
• Blood drawing (venipuncture) risks: Obtaining blood specimens may cause temporary 
discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, infection, feeling lightheaded, dizziness and 
fainting; in any of these cases you will receive care in the  clinic.  
• Risks of social harm: Participation in the study could result in social harms that could ca use 
a loss of privacy, stigmatization, repercussions at work, and coercion.  
• HIV and STD testing risks: Being tested for HIV and STDs may cause anxiety regardless of 
the test results. Receiving a confirmed positive result may have an intense emotional impac t. 
There is a chance that you are in the phase of an HIV and/or STD that cannot be detected by 
[CONTACT_421395]. There is also the remote possibility that the results are in error. 
Through extremely controlled procedures, we will reduce the chance that a result is in  error.  
 
4. Benefits  
• One possible benefit of participating in this research study is learning new things that  could 
help you. For example, you might learn about services available to male sex  workers.  
• If you take part in this study, you might also help others in the  future.

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623353]. Prior studies in labor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623354] a programmed intermittent bolus application of local anesthesia  can 
improve pain control thus reducing the amount of local anesthetic required as well as improve patient 
satisfaction when compared to continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_76250]. The effects of programmed intermittent bolus 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_623355] a surgical setting have yet to be elucidated. Our 
goal is to evaluate the use of programmed intermittent bolus compared to continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_584295] a 
surgical patient population. We plan to enroll patients already undergoing surgery under the enhanced 
recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways. ERAS pathway surgeries include colorectal, gynecologic, surgical 
oncology to name a few. The primary endpoints of the study will be the total local anesthetic consumption 
and total opi[INVESTIGATOR_623356].  Secondary 
endpoints are pain scores and functional measurements, patient satisfaction, and incidence of hypotension .

7.2  Describe the hypothesis or what the study hopes to prove : HYPOTHESIS: (Help Text updated 9/13)
Null hypothesis: There is no difference in total local anesthetic and opi[INVESTIGATOR_623357].
7.[ADDRESS_830145] the specific aims: AIMS: 
The aim of this study is to prove the superior efficacy of programmed intermittent bolus administration of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623358]-operative 
analgesia and patient satisfaction in a surgical patient population.
7.4  Briefly describe the study design (e.g., observational, interventional, randomized, placebo- DESIGN: 
controlled, blinded, cross-over, cross-sectional, longitudinal, pharmacokinetic, etc.):   
This is a prospective, randomized controlled study of programmed intermittent bolus administration of 
local anesthetic in epi[INVESTIGATOR_623359].
 
As part of the UCSF Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway, all patients  routinely treated with 
thoracic/lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_623360]-operative analgesia. The planned investigation does not 
change is approach, but compares solely two different modalities how epi[INVESTIGATOR_623361]. The study ends when the catheters are removed which is most often on  post-operative day 
two, but can be later in case the patient may still benefit from epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686].
During the duration of the treatment with epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686], enrolled patients will be randomized to 
receive either programmed intermittent bolus or continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_623362] (0.0625%) with fentanyl (2ug/ml). In addition to this maintenance administration 
of local anesthetic, the patient are also also able to apply additional (demand) boluses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_623363] a button. This technique, called patient- controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686] (PCEA), is 
routinely used in all patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_623364]. If the patients have still pain not covered by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_24686], 
they have access to additional RN-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388]. The normally used drugs for such 
treatment are oxycodone p.o. and hydromorphone i.v. However, other opi[INVESTIGATOR_623365] a  conversion to oral morphine equivalents. The 
primary outcomes of the study will be the total amount of local anesthetic administered and opi[INVESTIGATOR_16443] (oral morphine equivalents). Secondary outcomes arede: numeric pain rating scores (should 
not be different as patients have access to additional analgesic medication), number of patient attempts to 
trigger additional PCEA boluses, overall patient satisfaction assessed through validated questionnaires, and 
incidence of hypotension.
7.5   Briefly provide the background and significance of this study (e.g. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:
 why is this study needed) (space limit: one half page):
If this is a first in humans study, please summarize the safety data from the 
animal studies. For pediatric drug or device studies, please identify if this is the 
first study in pediatric populations.  
Programmed intermittent bolusing of epi[INVESTIGATOR_623366]. Whether these observations apply to 
post-surgical analgesia settings and post-surgical populations have yet to be elucidated.  Addressing the 
aforementioned question is of clinical importance as this may represent an avenue for the improvement of 
post-surgical analgesia that is not dependent on the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_623367].  The planned 
investigation would be the first study to investigate the use of programmed intermittent bolusing of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623368].                                                                                                                                           
                                           
7.6  Briefly summarize any preliminary studies relevant to your proposed PRELIMINARY STUDIES: 
research : (space limit: one half page)
Prior studies in the use of programmed intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_623369].  Wong et al (2006) showed in a randomized controlled trial that there was significantly less local 
anesthesia consumption, less requirement for manual rescue bolus, and higher satisfaction scores in the 
programmed intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_623370].  Since then 
numerous other randomized controlled trials were conducted in laboring women and a meta-analysis 
conducted in 2013 by [CONTACT_623394].

study documents.
All study participants will complete a questionaire that includes their pain history, an anxiety and 
depession questionaire (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]) and the WHO Disability Assessment 
Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0). Patients will be block randomized to the programmed intermittent bolus 
group or continuous infusion group.  As part of the existing ERAS pathways, all patients will receive a 
thoracic/lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_623371]. Both groups will receive the same standard concentration of local anesthestic 
(0.0625% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (fentanyl 2ug/mL) based epi[INVESTIGATOR_270376]. A total of 8mL of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_623372] a continuous infusion (8mL/hr) or programmed intermittent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_196619] (4mL bolus every 30 min) based on the study participant's randomization. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_623373], prior to the end of the surgical procedure  at the discretion of the intraoperative 
anesthesia provider.
The clinical  investigator who enrolled the patient will write the epi[INVESTIGATOR_623374]. A PACU nurse will 
be programming the pump following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13338].  The attending in the acute pain service will be 
informed about the enrollment of the patient in the study to ensure the pain service has all the information 
needed to ensure the best pain control to the patient in accordance with the study protocol. The display of 
the pump will be covered with a removable cover to make sure that the patient  will stay blinded about the 
treatment group. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_623375], not the 
study investigators. The study protocol allows the reduction of epi[INVESTIGATOR_623376] 8ml to 6ml/h (from 
4ml q30 to 3 ml q30 min in the bolus group) in case of hypotension.
 
Patients will have the option to administer patient controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (PCEA) in addition to the 
basal rate. For continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_623377], they can receive additional 2ml every 15 minutes (lock 
out period) for a total of 16ml/hr (8ml/hr from continuous infusion and up to 8ml from PCEA). To match 
the total epi[INVESTIGATOR_623378], they can receive additional 2ml 
using a lock out period of [ADDRESS_830146] UCSF ERAS protocol.  Hypotension and itching are 
some common adverse reactions to epi[INVESTIGATOR_623379]; we will treat and document these epi[INVESTIGATOR_623380].
 
Outcome measures will be total local anesthetic use (charted by [CONTACT_623395]), numeric rating scale (charted by [CONTACT_623396]), total PCEA button presses 
(recorded on epi[INVESTIGATOR_13860]),  anxiety and functional measures (WHODAS2.0, brief pain inventory, HADS 
survey) to be measured on post operative day 1 and 2.  Incidence of hypotension (charted by [CONTACT_623397]).
7.10  : To what extent, if any, do the planned research procedures differ STANDARD CLINICAL PRACTICE
from the care that people would otherwise receive at this institution or the study site if not being 
done locally:
 
The proposed study tries to maintain the care that patients would otherwise receive at UCSF.  The 
differences would be in the use of randomized assignment to programmed intermittent bolus of epi[INVESTIGATOR_623381].  As a measure of the efficacy of the different study arms, additional 
questionnaires, interviews listed below differ from standard clinical practice.
 
All other anesthetic interventions, including the placement and use of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810], the monitors, 
safety parameters, availability to pain physicians, supplemental pain medications are consistent with 
existing standard clinical practice.
7.[ADDRESS_830147] all questionnaires, surveys, interview, or focus group guides that will be used for INSTRUMENTS: 
this study:
A brief validated questionnaire (WHO diability assessment schedule 2.0; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623382]; brief pain inventory) will be adminstered at the time of enrollment into the study. During each 24-
hour period that the patient has the epi[INVESTIGATOR_321687], an abbreviated brief pain inventory (abbreviated to 
the inpatient population) will be administered. At the end of the study, prior to discharge, the patients will 
be handed another questionaire to assess the quality of pain control and patient satisfaction using the 
expanded brief pain inventory.  All the aforementioned surveys are previously published and validated 
questionnaires.

performed:
The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, two treatment parallel study.  
All patient description as well as outcome variables will compared between groups using appropriate tests, 
including  standard unpaired t-test for continuous variables, chi square tests for categorical variables, and 
ANOVA for variables with repeated measurements. Post hoc test will be applied if appropriate to assess for 
statistically significant differences between the two groups.

12.0  Risks and Benefits
12.1  Check if your study involves any of these specific research-related risks RESEARCH-RELATED RISKS: 
to participants that may need to be disclosed in the consent form:
For interventional studies, risk that the regimen may be more harmful or less effective than other 
available interventions
Risks associated with radiation exposure for imaging studies specifically for research purposes
Risks associated with the administration of contrast agent for imaging studies
Risks associated with withholding of treatment or discontinuation of current treatment (e.g., washout 
period is required by [CONTACT_4690])
For randomized, placebo-controlled trials, possible temporary or permanent health consequences from 
the deprivation of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504848] a sham surgical procedure, the risk that participants may experience increased 
morbidity without the possibility of benefit
Risks associated with modification or extension of a surgical procedure primarily for research purposes 
(e.g. risks associated with prolonging anesthesia, time in the operating room, etc.)
Risk of pain or physical discomfort caused by [CONTACT_174968][INVESTIGATOR_1102] (stress, embarassment, trauma)
For any boxes checked above, describe how you will minimize these risks and * 
discomforts, e.g., adding or increasing the frequency of monitoring, additional 
screening to identify and exclude people with diminished kidney or liver function, 
or modification of procedures such as changing imaging studies to avoid giving 
contrast agent to people who are more likely to suffer side effects from it, etc.: 
(REQUIRED)
Participants in the study have the risk that their study intervention (local anesthesic administration by 
[CONTACT_623406]) results in inferior pain control. To ameliorate this risk we are 
firstly offering all patients the ability to obtain addtional (demand) bolus administrations of local anesthetic 
and fentanyl through their epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810]. Secondly, all patients will have additional analgesics ordered 
in case they require additional pain control. We expect that all patients will be offered excellent pain 
control. For this reason, we did not choose pain scores as primary endpoint (we don't expect any 
differences here), but the need to administer additional analgesics.
12.2  Describe any anticipated risks and discomforts not listed above: RISKS: 
There are risks associated with the placement and use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686]. However, this study will only 
performed in patients who have already consented to the current standard of care in the ERAS pathways. 
ERAS pathways routinely includes the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686].  Patients in this study will be seen daily 
by [CONTACT_623407]. They will routinely be asked for 
side effects of regional anesthesia such as hypotension, itching and the catheter site will be inspected. In 
case of hypotension with a mean arterial blood pressure <[ADDRESS_830155].
 
 
12.3  
MINIMIZING RISKS: Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the risks/discomforts to 
subjects. Examples include:
designing the study to make use of procedures involving less risk when appropriate
minimizing study procedures by [CONTACT_25943] a plan for evaluation and possible referral of subjects who report suicidal ideation
There will be no interference with the care of the patient. The treatment of enrolled patients is not 
different from patients who do not participate in the study. We have already been using the programmed 
intermittent bolus function successfully in these patients, but it always happened at the descretion of the 
ordering anesthesia provider.
All procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_623408].  Medication changes to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_623390].  
Patient data remains confidential and de-identified. Only encrypted computers will be used for data 
collection and management.

of the rights and welfare of participants:    These resources typi[INVESTIGATOR_174938] (in terms availability, number, expertise and experience), funding, space, 
  equipment, and time to devote to study activities.  Depending on the nature of the research study, 
investigators should consider the proximity or availability of critical resources that may be essential 
to the safety and welfare of participants, such as
the proximity of an emergency facility for care of participant injury
availability of psychological support after participation
resources for participant communication, such as language translation services
The treatment of study patients does not deviate from our current clinical practice. The additional riks to 
the wellfare of the patients should be minimal.
The use of a study coordinator facilitates patient enrollment and should minimize delays in the clinical care 
of the patients. All procedures the patients are undergoing are part of their regular medical care. The only 
additional study interventions are the programming of the pump, the follow visits and the follow up 
interview.
To protect the patient's privacy and medical information, all study documentation will be secured in a 
locked file cabinet.  Data will be collected using RedCap. Only encrypted computer will be used.
 
12.5  BENEFITS: * (REQUIRED)  Note: These are the benefits that the IRB will consider during their review.

Closer follow-up than standard care may lead to improved outcomes or patient engagement
Health and lifestyle changes may occur as a result of participation
Knowledge may be gained about their health and health conditions
Feeling of contribution to knowledge in the health or social sciences field
The research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation 
of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children
Other benefit (describe below)
None
12.6  Explain why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated RISK TO BENEFIT RATIO: 
benefits, if any, to the participant or society:
The treatment of study patients does not deviate from our current clinical practice. The additional riks to 
the wellfare of the patients should be minimal.

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
 
Title:  Collaborative care teams for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519473]: Translating evidence into practice  
Grant Number:  1U01TR002756 -01A1  
Study Description:  The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention by [CONTACT_519580][INVESTIGATOR_519474] (OUD) can increase 
initiation of medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_519475] r (MOUD) and improve 
linkage to OUD -focused follow -up care. If the aims of the research are 
achieved, we hope to improve MOUD initiation and linkage to follow -
up care as well as clinical outcomes, and, ultimately, create a 
generalizable, sustainable model of care to increase OUD treatment 
delivery and decrease the downstream effects of untreated OUD. If 
effective, this translational model also can be used to increase uptake of evidence -based practices for other substance use and associated 
behavioral health  disorders.  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objectives : 
1. To test the effectiveness of the START intervention on MOUD 
initiation relative to usual care.  
2. To test the effectiveness of the START intervention on linkage with 
post -discharge OUD treatment relative to usual care.  
Secondary Objectives : 
1. To test the effectiveness of the START intervention on addiction -
focused discharge planning.  
2. To test the effectiveness of the START intervention on MOUD 
engagement relative to usual care.  
3. To test the effectiveness of the START intervention on linkage to 
medical care relative to usual care.  
4. To test the effectiveness of the START intervention on self -reported 
days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_519476].  
Endpoint s: Primary Endpoints : 
1. Proportion of patients in each arm who initiate MOUD prior to 
discharge, defined as use of any FDA -approved pharmacotherapy 
for OUD, including buprenorphine, naltrexone and methadone.  
2. Proportion of patients in each arm who attend at least one OUD -
related care visit within 30 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
Secondary Endpoints : 
1. Proportion of patients in each arm with an after- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519477] a date and time for a post- discharge addiction care 
appointment .  
2. Proportion of patients in each arm who initiate MOUD or continue 
MOUD treatment within [ADDRESS_673899] 30 days.  
Study Population:  Inpatients * at three medical hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519478], [LOCATION_005], and

Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation:  The intervention is a collaborative care team called the Substance Use 
Treatment and Recovery Team (START). START is comprised of an Addiction Medicine Specialist (AMS) and a Care Manager (CM). The AMS and CM work closely together to treat patients. The CM assesses readiness, discusses treatment options, ass ists with linkage to follow -
up care, and tracks patient progress in a registry. The AMS assists 
patients with initiating MOUD, when indicated. The study intervention 
is initiated  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519481] s a total of 4 -6 hours, with various 
components delivered at different time points during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].   
(Intervention periods must be flexible to work around medical care and patient wellbeing.) The intervention will be conducted in -person or via 
telehealth (telephone or televideo) depending on COVID -[ADDRESS_673902] approximately 15-20 minutes each.  
Study Duration:  11 months  
Participant Duration:  Participant will complete study -related tasks over 4 -6 hours during the 
course of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Weekly phone calls of approximately 
15-20 minutes each will be conducted for up to one month after 
discharge. A 30 -40 minute 1 -month follow -up interview will be 
conducted.  
Research Procedures  
 The primary research visits are as follows:  
• Eligibility screening : A member of the research team conducts 
eligibility screening with the patient. Responses are entered into 
the REDCap database.

2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
Problem/question. In the past decade, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519484], from 301,707 in 2002 to 
520,275 in 2012, with inpatient charges for these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519485].1 Patients admitted 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519486].2,3 
Medication for OUD (MOUD), is rarely initiated in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and patients are seldom linked to 
outpatient  treatment  after discharge .[ADDRESS_673908]- discharge treatment are at high -risk of continued misuse, delays in care, future 
overdose and costly readmission.4-9 This study identifies the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71066] a new opportunity 
to initiate MOUD and link patients with follow -up care for their OUD. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519487] -up care for patients with an OUD.10  
Rationale for the clinical trial and intervention.  Collaborative care is a team -based treatment approach 
that uses multi -faceted interventions (care management, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy), 
measure ment -based care , and patient registries  to increase delivery of evidence -based care. A 
collaborative care team (CCT) in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519488], an organized system of care,  and 
opportunities for  patient education . A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based CCT  has the potential to facilitate  initiation of  
MOUD during the inpatient stay and link age to  post -discharge care.[ADDRESS_673909], called the Substance Use Treatment 
and Recovery Team (START), increases the use of evidence- based interventions for OUD (i.e., MOUD and 
OUD -focused discharge  planning) and improves linkage to follow -up care among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519489].  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
The underuse of effective treatments for behavioral health conditions in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519490].17 Patients with behavioral health conditions are often hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519491],18-23 and the clinical conditions that prompt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519492].24 However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_519493] -morbidity, few patients receive evidence -based treatments, or are successfully linked 
to treatment after discharge.2-4,25 This has critical consequences: patients  with mental health and 
substance use comorbidities have longer length of stay, higher readmission rates, and worse 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673910] the organizational infrastru cture 
needed to treat behavioral health conditions effectively, such as dedicated teams, evidence- based 
protocols, or the ability to coordinate care transitions, such that patients can be linked to community 
resources.
29 Separate funding streams, stringent federal privacy regulations, and long waiting lists for 
publicly -funded treatment, create additional barriers.30,31 Finally, patients with behavioral health 
conditions often experience stigma, even from health care professionals, a known barrier to 
treatment.32,33 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537] (OUD) are an exemplar of this problem.31,[ADDRESS_673911] decade, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519484], from 
301,707 in 2002 to 520,275 in 2012, with inpatient charges for these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519494].1 Although treatment for OUD is highly effective,36-38 patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519495] —the OUD2,3 – or 
are linked with outpatient treatment.4,[ADDRESS_673912] medical advice (~15%) suggest 
failed care transitions.9 While the acute manifestations of an OUD (such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_519496]) may be addressed, effective treatment for the underlying disease itself, medication for OUD 
(MOUD), is rarely initiated during the inpatient stay, and patients are seldo m linked to post -discharge 
treatment.[ADDRESS_673913] of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_519497], in 2015 only 20% of those with a drug use problem received any 
treatment.40,41 And, among Medicaid enrollees, only 25% of those hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191546] a substance use 
disorder were linked with post -discharge treatment.4 MOUD (buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone and 
injectable naltrexone)  cuts overdose rates, reduces criminal behavior and infectious disease, and lowers 
mortality.36,37,[ADDRESS_673914] medical advice (~15%), 
which can tr uncate treatment for the condition that prompted the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

persistence to find an opening for treatment) and federal privacy regulations that effectively segregate medical and substance use care.

of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]; all are limited in that all of them are provided by a single individual and are 
focused on addressing the acute problem. In t he traditional consultation -liaison psychiatry model, a 
primary medical or surgical team requests a consultation for a recognized problem and is responsible for 
implementing the consultant’s recommendations. In the proactive model,50,[ADDRESS_673917] started to develop addiction consultation services —suggesting feasibility and readiness —
research on these services has been observational rather than experimental.5,11,43,46,59,[ADDRESS_673918] whether an inpatient collaborative care 
team (CCT) approach to increasing treatment delivery can improve outcomes.  
There is a strong scientific premise for testing the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary, collaborative 
care team (CCT) as a translational approach to the problem of OUD treatment underuse. Substantial 
evidence supports the use of collaborative care for behavioral health disorders,[ADDRESS_673919] 2023

interventions (care management, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy), clinical measures, systematic 
patient registries, and a team orientation to increase delivery of evidence -based c are. By [CONTACT_519583][INVESTIGATOR_307] -based physicians lack, creating an organized system of care, providing 
patient education with a focus on self -management and harm reduction (e.g. , giving patients 
prescriptions for naloxone), and addressing barriers to follow -up care, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- based CCT could 
overcome the translational roadblocks to initiating MOUD during the inpatient stay and linking patients 
with post -discharge care.11 If CCTs work, they could be a new and highly significant translational 
approach to addressing the problem of OUD treatment underuse.  
The study offers a new model —a consultation service -based collaborative care team —for improving 
care processes for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519499]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71070] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71071] -up care for several patient populations at high risk of 
readmission,72,[ADDRESS_673920] common SUDs among inpatients.  
Our study is a multi -site, randomized pragmatic trial in being conducted in three diverse sites . The study , 
called the Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START) , will evaluate whether a CCT increases 
the use of two interventions —MOUD with buprenorphine, methadone or injectable naltrexone, and 
OUD -focused discharge planning— among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519500] -up care  relative to usual care.  The START consists of an addiction medicine specialist and a care 
manager who w ill use evidence -based tools to decrease barriers to MOUD and engage patients with 
post -discharge OUD care. We will randomize [ADDRESS_673921] because it both improves public health and advances 
translational science. Our study simultaneously addresses a critical public health problem –  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_305065] – and advances translational science. The undertreatment of OUD is arguably the most important 
translational science problem related to  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562]. In 2015, 11.5 million individuals reported 
misusing opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942] 1.9 million reported being addicted to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],
75 yet fewer than 20% receive any 
treatment.40,41 By [CONTACT_519584] a new translational approach –  the CCT on treatment

range of traditional patient -level outcomes, we go beyond the usual scope of  clinical trials. Diffusion of 
innovation theory emphasizes that factors related to context influence implementation.
76 This 
innovative approach to study design can generate more rapid translational gains, more effective 
downstream implementation and dissemination strategies, and more practical information for decision -
makers.  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
The study procedures involve  the following potential risks : (1) unauthorized disclosures of sensitive 
information, (2) psychological distress, and ( 3) financial costs associated with treatment. See Protection 
of Human Subjects.   
1. Disclosures of Sensitive Information: Potential risks  include transmission of protected health 
information without using encryption, without password protection, or to an unintended member of the research team , and transmission of protected health information outside of the 
study team. A breach of confidentiality could cause  psychological or other harm to patients due 
to disclosure of sensitive study  information.   
2. Psychological Distress:   Patients could experience psychological distress from discussing their 
substance use and mental health during data collection or the intervention.   
3. Financial Costs of Treatment: Patients could experience  distress over costs of treatment.  
Note that patients could experience some expected side effects of OUD medication, however, this 
study is not testing the efficacy of medications. Medications, which are optional, are FDA -approved 
and considered the standard of care  for treatment of OUD .

sustainable.  
These knowledge gains will provide invaluable, preliminary information on how to improve the quality 
of care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519501].  
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Because the purpose of this study is to increase the use of FDA -approved, evidence -based treatments 
for OUD, for each individual patient enrolled, the potential benefits of participation are likely to 
outweigh risks. Untreated OUD puts  patients at risk for fatal and non -fatal overdose as well as other 
acute and chronic harms. In addition, the study is intended to inform hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ and national 
policymakers’ responses to the current crisis in the overuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], with its attendant 
high fatality rates. Thus, the research offers substantial potential benefit to both subjects and society  
with little risk to patients .  
We will minimize risks in the following ways:  
Disclosure of Sensitive Information : We will protect against unauthorized disclosures of information 
through a robust data safeguarding plan. Site PIs will be responsible for serving as local data safeguarding officers, assuring adherence to the study data safeguarding plan and training in human  
subjects protections. Standard procedures will include storing data on secure institutional password -
protected servers, using password -protection and encryption when transmitting any data (including 
within a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l), limiting access to patient identifiers to the smallest number of individuals possible, 
ensuring that datasets do not have sensitive information in them unless necessary, assigning patients 
study ID numbers at random to enable removal of other direct HI PAA identifiers from datasets, and 
ensuring that all individuals who handle study data and study staff are trained in human subjects 
protections, HIPAA, and study procedures. Individuals who handle data on potential or actual  study 
subjects will be require d to avoid any unplanned disclosures of information beyond the study team, and 
will be required to report any unplanned disclosures.   
Per Section [ADDRESS_673925] as implemented in the 2017 NIH Certificates of 
Confidentiality Policy, all ongoing or new research funded by [CONTACT_119185] 13, 2016 that is 
collecting or using identifiable, sensitive information is autom atically issued a Certificate of 
Confidentiality. Researchers with a Certificate of Confidentiality may ONLY disclose identifiable, sensitive 
information in the following circumstances: if required by [CONTACT_519588], State, or local laws, such as for 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673926] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 20 reporting of communicable diseases; if the subject consents; or for the purposes of scientific research 
that is compliant with human subjects regulations.   
Psychological Distress : To reduce the potential for psychological risks, study coordinators and members 
of the START  will undergo training to ensure that they approach patients in a manner that is empathetic 
and non -judgmental, based on principles of motivational interviewing. If patients exhibit mild to 
moderate discomfort with study eligibility or survey questions, the study coordinator will ask the patient whether he/she prefers to complete the activity later. If patients exhibit severe distress, this will be interpreted as  an inability to consent. If a patient volunteers that they are having thoughts about 
harming themselves or others, they will be referred to a psychiatrist immediately. If the participant reports any thoughts of suicide during the baseline interview (i.e. score d anything other than never —
1,2, 3, DK, REF —on  MH1i), upon completion of the interview the interviewer will inform the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_108527]-I, who will ensure that a physician on the primary team is aware and can address in accordance with 
their standard of care  as indicated. If the participant reports an thoughts of suicide during the follow -up 
interview (i.e. scored anything other than never— 1,2, 3, DK, REF —on  MH1i), the CSSRS (see below) will 
be administered in REDCap.  If the patient is at high -risk of suicide per the CSSRS, the interviewer will 
address this upon completion of the interview. The interviewer will refer the patient to a suicide hotline and will inform the study clinician (site PI/Co -I or other). If the participant appears to be experiencing 
emo tional distress  during the baseline interview , the interviewer will ask the participant if they would 
like the interviewer to make the primary team aware.  If the participant appears to be experiencing 
emotional distress  during the follow -up interview , the interviewer will ask the participant if they would 
like to receive support after the call.  If so, upon completion of the interview the interviewer will provide 
the number of local mental health resources . Study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519502] -staff psychiatrists available at all 
times in case of psychiatric emergencies.    
Adverse Effects of Treatment : The Addiction Medicine S pecialist on the START  will adhere to clinical 
standards of care for the field . S/he will also adhere to the following the clinical protocols used in the 
study related to initiating, adjusting, discontinuing, or otherwise changing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519503]. Medications will be monitored clinically, particularly during dose adjustments. If patients 
report any adverse effects of tre atment to study staff, these will be immediately reported to the treating 
providers who ordered the treatment. For example, if a patient tells a ca re manager about medication 
side effects, then the ca re manager would immediately refer this information to t he treating physician. 
The risks of treatment with MOUD are similar to but lower than those associated with untreated OUD.   
Financial Costs to Patients :  The study aims to test whether the START intervention facilitates linkage to 
treatment.  This could result in financial cost to patients who engage in treatment.  As part of the 
intervention group (START), the care  manager will  work with patients to try to minimize the costs of any 
medications and follow -up care by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_519504].  Usual care patients could receive assistance in 
mini mizing the costs of medications and follow -up care as part of regular discharge planning by [CONTACT_302090].

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Design  
This study is a pragmatic  randomized controlled  trial (RCT) to evaluate  primarily  whether the START 
intervention compared to usual care increases initiation of medication for OUD in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]— MOUD 
with buprenorphine, methadone or injectable naltrexone, linkage to OUD care post -discharge —among 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519499]. The study also will evaluate the effect of the START intervention on 
post -discharge planning, linkage with or continuation of MOUD, utilization of medical care and 
reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_519506].  
The START intervention consists of an addiction medicine specialist and a care manager who will use 
evidence -based tools such as motivational interviewing and addiction -focused discharge planning to 
decrease barriers to MOUD and engage patients with post -discharge OUD care.   
The trial will be implemented at Cedars -Sinai Medical Center (CSMC)  in Los Angeles, the University of 
New Mexico Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519507], and Baystate Health in Springfield, [LOCATION_005] .  Patients will 
be randomly assigned within each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519508], stratifying by [CONTACT_519589].

Phase  
N/A - This is a pragmatic clinical trial.   
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
 
The study is a randomized controlled trial testing the START intervention compared with usual care. 
Usual care at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519510] a psychiatric consultation service with an AMS or directly to an AMS not affiliated with a consultation 
service.  None of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519511] a collaborative care team that 
consists of an AMS –  CM team that uses a set of principles based on collaborative care along with 
evidence -based tools to support the medical team in intervening with patients with OUD and delivering 
for OUD treatment in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212051].  This pragmatic trial intends to measure the 
START intervention’s effectiveness compared with usual  care in diverse hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225]. The RCT design 
allows for this comparison.   
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673932] (care manager) and 
AMS  team, the team using  evidence -based practices and tools , close collaboration between the AMS 
and CM, and follow -up with the patient.[ADDRESS_673933] defined fidelity as incorporating elements of each core component. Thus, we do not set values on the dosage of the intervention. Rather , we define 
the intervention as interacting with the AMS and CM team, the AMS and CM incorporating evidence -
based tools (brief negotiated interview and addiction -focused discharge planning) and the patient 
receiving follow -up care. Common in pragmatic trials, the study uses an “intent -to-treat” design, thus all 
participants randomized to receive the START intervention will be included in the evaluation regardless of whether they receive the intervention . We anticipate it will be rare for participants to receive none of 
the intervention components.  As an exploratory analysis, we will incorporate dosage (number of visits 
with the START) into our statistical models to understand the relationship between amount of 
intervention received  and intervention effects . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_673934] completed the study if he or she has completed the baseline and 1 -
month follow -up assessments.  Ideally , the participant will also receive some or all of the intervention 
but due to the dynamic nature of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (unpredictable medical treatments and discharge, 
leaving against medical advice) and post -discharge complexities, participants may not be able to receive 
the whole intervention. Nevertheless, the study is “intent to treat,” so all participants in the intervention condition will be included in the analysis.  
[ADDRESS_673935] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Admitted to an inpatient bed or for observation at Cedars -Sinai Medical Center  (CSMC), 
University of New Mexico Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (UNM), or Baystate Health (BH)  
2. Age [ADDRESS_673936] a probable OUD diagnosis, defined by [CONTACT_171858] >[ADDRESS_673937] (ASSIST)  
4. Speaks English or Spanish as primary language  
5. Able to provide informed consent

 26 5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
1. Currently receiving FDA -approved medication treatment for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] * 
2. <6 months life expectancy  
*”Currently receiving medication” is defined as medications on order at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519512], as indicated by [CONTACT_519590], or by [CONTACT_18654]- report 
on the eligibility screener of taking the medication s ince their admission or being told by [CONTACT_519591][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
N/A 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who  do not meet eligibility criteria for participation in this 
trial or who consent to participate in this study  but are not subsequently assigned to the study 
intervention (i.e.,  they are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519513]/or randomization ).  
 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that are likely to change over time may be rescreened. Examples include 
if someone reenters the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519514]- approved medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], or was discharged or left AMA before being 
randomized . Rescreened participants will be a new  participant number as for the initial screening.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
5.5.1  PATIENT IDENTIFICATION AND RECRUITMENT  
 
1. Approved study staff will prescreen patients for screening and potential enrollment in two ways:  
o A daily electronic medical record (EMR) report of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] (“Daily Report”) that 
lists potentially eligible subjects (variables include demographics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_519515], 
diagnoses, and screenings)  
o Clinician referral  
2. Approved study staff will approach patients in two ways:  
o CSMC Only: Potential subjects will be contact[CONTACT_519592]- to-Patient Recruitment Letter. A courtesy notification will 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673939] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 27 be sent to subjects’ treating physicians to notify them of the invitation to participate 
whenever feasible.  
o Baystate and UNM: If the attending physician agrees, the physician, someone from the medical team or designated study staff will explain the study to the patient.  
3. The study team will use the following advertising and recruitment materials (Appendix 10.1):  
For physicians:  
o Study Physician Flyer  
o Physician Screening Card  
o Physician Recruitment Letter (Dear [CONTACT_344952]) , accompanied by [CONTACT_519593]:  
o Baystate and UNM: Physician to Patient Letter  (Dear Patient Letter) to be provided to 
patients deemed eligible for the study.  
o CSMC: Direct -to-Patient  Recruitment  Letter  (Dear Patient Letter) to be provided  by 
[CONTACT_519594].  
5.5.2  CONSENT AND ENROLLMENT  
1. Approved study staff will provide the full consent form and review the consent summary 
(Appendix 10.1) with the patient.  
2. Consent will be  obtained in -person either on paper or electronically using an approved platform 
or remotely using an approved platform.  
3. When signing electronically, patients  will be offered the option of receiving a copy of the signed 
and dated consent form by [CONTACT_519595]. Otherwise, they will be given a paper copy.  
4. Approved study staff will enroll consented, eligible patients by [CONTACT_20526] a study ID in the 
REDCap project.  
5. All patients will be given patient education materials on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], as well as harm reduction materials (Appendix 10.1). If the visit is remote, the research team will give these 
materials to a member of the medical team to deliver to the patient or place them in the 
patient’s ro om. 
 
5.5.1 – 5.5.[ADDRESS_673940] information (e.g., new phone number).  Participants without a means of 
being contact[CONTACT_519596] -up period will be provided a pre -paid phone with minutes by [CONTACT_10748].

 30 6 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION  ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
The components  of the START intervention  are as follows  (see the START Intervention Manual  for 
details ):  
 
1. Triage  (Care Manager [CM]  and Addiction Medicine Specialist [AMS]):   
o The CM  assesses  the patient  for acute biomedical needs related to the OUD.  The AMS 
addresses acute biomedical needs (e.g. facilitates withdrawal management).    
2. Engage, assess, plan  (CM and AMS) (conducted in person or remotely based on circumstances):  
3. If there is not an urgent need for medical intervention  or after the urgent medical need is 
addressed, the CM  and/or  AMS:    
o engages  with  the patient (CM and AMS)   
o conducts  a diagnostic and biopsychosocial assessment  (CM)    
o conducts a complete biomedical assessment and addresses comorbidities (AMS)   
o delivers  the START intervention, consisting of elements of the brief negotiated interview 
(BNI) and re -engineered discharge (RED)  – two evidence -based interventions to assess 
and increase  readiness  – and develops  a plan for initiating  evidence- based treatment for 
OUD (MOUD and/or psychosocial treatment) during and after the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  (CM)   
o ensures the patient understands the follow- up plan and addresses barriers (CM).  
4. Treat  (AMS):   
o The AMS facilitates MOUD initiation.  
o The AMS facilitates psychosocial treatment for the substance use disorder, if indicated 
and available.   
5. Communicate  and Coordinate  (CM, AMS)  
o The CM and AMS communicate with each other  to continue care through one -month (or 
more) after the patient is discharged.    
o The CM and AMS communicate with the  patient and  medical  team,  and, when 
appropriate,  the patient’s family  and outpatient providers.   
6. Follow -up (CM):   
o The CM calls the patient at least once a week for 1 month  after the patient is discharged 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519516].   
o The CM may also call outpatient providers to determine if the patient linked to care and 
has encountered barriers.   
7. Monitor (AMS):   
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673944] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 31 o The AMS continues to monitor the patient after discharge through the CM’s follow- up 
work.  
6.1.2  USUAL CARE DESCRIPTION  
 
Usual care consists of each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s current practices for managing patients identified with OUD along 
with each patient enrolled in the study receiving MOUD education and referral information.  None of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519517] a collaborative care team that consists of an AMS –  CM team that 
uses a set of principles based on collaborative care along with evidence -based tools to support the 
medical team in intervening with patients with  OUD and delivering OUD treatment in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519518].  The AMS at all three hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519519].  Usual care at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519520].  
 
At CSMC, patients randomized to the UC study condition may receive a referral to the existing 
consultation liaison (CL) service if the patient’s medical team determines the need for a consult, or they 
will be treated and provided discharge planning directly by [CONTACT_40730].  The CSMC CL service has several psychiatrists  and social workers who can discuss opi[INVESTIGATOR_519521], if indicated. These providers can also provide consultation to the medical team on whether medication initiation in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519522] d ischarge are indicated.  If the START 
AMS or CM receive a referral from a medical team, they will check the electronic medical record to see if 
the patient is in the study  and their study condition .  If the patient is in the UC condition, they will pass 
the referral to another psychiatrist and/or CM.  The study AMS and CM will not take any referrals for UC 
patients for the duration of the study . If directly approached by a member of the medical team for 
consultation, the study AMS or CM will refer them to  [LOCATION_004] Bridge Program resources.   
 
At Baystate, patients randomized to the UC study condition can be treated directly with MOUD and 
provided discharge planning by [CONTACT_40730].  If the START AMS or CM receives a referral from a 
medical team, they will check the electronic medical record  to see if the patient is in the study and their 
study condition.  If the patient is in the UC condition, they will refer the referring physician to [LOCATION_004] 
Bridge Program resources.  For patients in the UC study condition, the referring physician will have the 
option to contact [CONTACT_519597], which does not include an AMS or 
CM.  
At UNM, patients randomized to the UC study condition can be treated directly with MOUD and 
provided discharge planning by [CONTACT_40730]. If the AMS is contact[CONTACT_5365] a consult about a patient 
in the UC condition, the AMS will provide the medical team wi th an existing wiki page link and/or 
[LOCATION_004] Bridge Program resources.  When the AMS receives a referral, they  will check a study -staff 
maintained registry to determine if referred patients are in the study and their study condition.  
6.1.3  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673945] TRAINING

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Randomization  
1. Approved study staff will randomize the patient to the START or UC arm  in the stratified block 
design using REDCap.  
2. Subjects will be stratified  according to prior M OUD  exposure (yes/no) and randomized into 
START or UC.  
3. A stratified, block randomization design will be used stratified by [CONTACT_519599], 
and using randomly permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 8.  
4. Research staff will access the ir site -specific  randomization module in REDCap. Staff will enter 
which M OUD  stratum the patient is in and the intervention arm assignment will be generated.  
5. Enrollment will be continuous with the goal of reaching the desired sample size, and  some sites 
may enroll more or less than the targeted [ADDRESS_673948] been randomized .  
 While it is likely (and expected) that medical teams will treat patients in both the experimental and usual 
care (UC) conditions, patients in the START will have an enhanced experience because they (unlike 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673949] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 34 patients in the UC condition) will be receiving START components designed to increase their readiness to 
take the medication and link to follow -up care. Moreover, the support provided by [CONTACT_519600]. Even as medical teams become 
more aware of MOUD and perhaps increase prescribing, we hypothesize that patients whose medical 
teams receive support for their START patients will still be more likely to receive medication, even if 
medical teams are aware they can prescribe these medications. Thus, over time, while we might see 
increased medication initiation for patients in both study c onditions, we still hypothesize statistically 
and clinically significant differences for patients in the START group. Nevertheless, we still plan to safeguard against any biases and effects of UC patients receiving the START. The research team will 
review electronic health record data to determine whether the START AMS or CM accidentally treated 
UC patients.

When a subject discontinues from  the START intervention but not from the study , either because they 
decline to participate or leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], remaining study procedures will be completed as indicated 
by [CONTACT_4690].    
 The data to be documented  at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods for 
determining the need to discontinue  (e.g., patient declined/refused, patient left AMA, unable to 
contact [CONTACT_519601])  
 
• Patients who discontinue the intervention will still be contact[CONTACT_519602] [ADDRESS_673950] 2023

 35 7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
 
Participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form 
(CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form, are randomized and receive the study intervention, 
and subsequently withdraw or are discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.  
 
Investigators will not withdraw a participant from the study  unless the participant withdraws consent to 
use data  not already collected , as all participants will be included in the analysis whether or not they 
receive the intervention.  
 
Intent -to-Treat. All participants who are randomized are included in the statistical analysis and analyzed 
according to the group they were originally assigned, regardless of what treatment (if any) they 
received. This method allows the investigator (or consumer of the medical literature) to draw accurate 
(unbiased) conclusions regarding the effectiveness of an intervention. This method preserves the 
benefits of randomization, which cannot be assumed when using other methods of analysis.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol defines an adverse event (AE) as any unfavorable and unintended symptom or disease that 
an investigator or study staff learns about which occurs during a patient’s enrollment in the study, if it is 
considered by [CONTACT_519609] a  study treatment or procedure  (“possibly 
related” means there is a reasonable possibility that AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_519610]) . 
All AEs  possibly related to a study treatment or procedure learned about during the course of a patient’s 
enrollment in the study (from time of consent through the follow- up interview or close of the follow -up 
window if they do not have their follow -up interview) will be recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_7880] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or clinician and CSMC PI, and study staff, and reported further per guidelines described in section 
8.3.[ADDRESS_673962] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 42  
This protocol defines a serious adverse event (SAE) as an AE that an investigator or study staff learns about that is fatal, life -threatening, prolongs initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requires inpatient rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or is medically significant and which the investigators and/or clinicians regard as serious based on 
appropriate medical judgment . With the exception of fatalities, other SAEs documented this study are 
considered  those is possibly related to the study ; other events occurring during the normal of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519534].  
Classification of SEVERITY AND RELATEDNESS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
The following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities  or prescribed course of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23047] .  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning  or prescribed 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23047] . 
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity or prescribed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519535]. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to a “serious  adverse 
event ”. 
 Severity will be used as a factor in determining expectedness of an event, and therefore, in determining if it requires reporting. Changes in severity will guide the duration an event is followed as well as 
potential changes in reporting requirements for t hat event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
AEs considered by [CONTACT_519611], including the intervention, assessed by [CONTACT_519612]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the cate gories below.   
 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to study procedures administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_519613] e or other drugs 
or chemicals , or other events . The response to withdrawal of the study procedures should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive.  
• Probably Related –  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study procedures, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or oth er drugs or chemicals  
or events , and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  
• Unlikely to be related –  A clinical event whose temporal relationship to study procedures 
administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673963] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 43 reasonable time after administration of the study procedures) and in which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease or events provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related –  The AE is completely independent of study procedures administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
Because the intervention is randomization to a collaborative care team and MOUD initiation is not 
considered part of the intervention, known adverse reactions to a specific medication will not be 
considered related to the study intervention. And, because o f the likelihood of adverse events during 
the inpatient stay due to patients’ illness or injury, most AEs/SAEs likely will not be related to the 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
Study  clinician s with appropriate expertise in addiction medicine will be responsible for determining 
whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study procedures . 
 
Expected events will not be reported or followed as AEs. Because the study is being conducted among a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519536], patients likely will have many comorbid conditions as well 
as a higher likelihood of unexpected complications, death or readmission from disease.  Any medical or 
psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not  reported or followed  as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deter iorates at any time during the study  and is considered by [CONTACT_519614] , it will be recorded as an AE. Common side -effects associated with taking MOUD will not be 
reported as AEs (see Appendix 11. 3) and will be monitored by [CONTACT_519615] .  
 The only expected AEs  from the START intervention (and not MOUD) may be psychological distress 
related to discussing OUD and seeking treatment.   
 
8.3.3  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study encounters either in -person or over the phone  – at enrollment, interviews , 
or follow -up calls),  or through notification by a clinician or other source.  
 
AEs and SAEs  possibly related to the study will be captured on the case report form (CRF) in REDCap 
(Reporting Form) by [CONTACT_519616], participant's clinical status (including any 
underlying conditions), study ID, gender and age ; REDCap will then prompt for the information

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 44 applicable to the type of event be completed. Information to be collected, as applicable to the event 
type, may include:   
 
• protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number  
• date of enrollment and randomization  
• a detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• an explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an  AE/SAE, PD, or  UP 
• times of awareness and onset  
• concomitant medications  
• dates and findings of any relevant tests/assessments that have taken place  
• clinician’s assessment of expectedness, severity, and relationship to study procedures (assessed 
only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis)  
• time of resolution/stabilization of the event.  
• a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the event  
All AEs  and SAEs  learned about by [CONTACT_519617]’s enrollment in the study that are 
possibly related to the study will be documented regardless of expectedness. All AEs and SAEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_31233].  
 
The study coordinator or designated staff member at each site will record events with start dates 
occurring any time after informed consent is obtained  and end dates occurring up  until 7 (for non -
serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation  (i.e., end of follow -up window) .  
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
8.3.4  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
When deciding whether an event should be recorded on the reporting form in REDCap, each site’s study 
coordinator or designated staff member will consult with the site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or their designated clinical 
study staff member . Following consultation, AEs and SAEs possibly related to the study will be recorded 
by [CONTACT_25733]’s study coordinator or designated staff member in the REDCap Reporting Form. Each site PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or their designated clinical study staff member will review the form and investigate each event further to ascertain: (1) nature of the event (disclosure, psychological distress, or physical harm), (2) 
type and degree of actual harm (potential, social/psychological, physical), (3) type and degree of 
potential harm (social/psychological, physical), (4) potential attribution to the re search study, (5) 
potential contributing factors, and (6) potential for recurrence. The research team (the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_126985], with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_57370]) will confer on how to handle the events, including discussing them 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673965]. Danovitch and the CSMC Study Coordinator upon entry 
into REDCap, but regular AEs will not.  
 
IRB reporting: AEs that are not SAEs do not need to be reported to CS -IRB. See below for SAE reporting.  
 DSMB reporting: All AEs considered possibly related to the study and all SAEs will be summarized and 
reported to the DSMB at three time points during data collection.  
8.3.5  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Upon consultation with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_519537]/or their designated clinical study staff member, SAEs  possibly 
related to the study  will be recorded by [CONTACT_25733]’s study coordinator or designated study staff in the 
REDCap Reporting Form. All patient deaths learned about by [CONTACT_519618]. Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or designated 
clinical study staff member will review the form and investigate each event further to ascertain: (1) 
nature of the event (psychological distress, or physical harm), (2) type and degree of actual harm 
(potential, social/psychological, physical), (3) type and degree of potential harm (social/psychological, 
physical), (4) potential attribution to the res earch study, (5) potential contributing factors, and (6) 
potential for recurrence. The research team (the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461], with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_57370]) will 
confer on how to handle the events, including discussing them with the IRB, if uncertainty exis ts.  
SAEs will be sent to [CONTACT_519648] and the CSMC Study Coordinator upon entry into REDCap. [CONTACT_519649] and the CSMC study coordinator who will review the form and notify the CS -IRB and the 
DSMB as required and outlined below.  
 
IRB reporting: SAEs must be reported to the Cedars -Sinai IRB if they are unexpected (e.g., not listed in 
the consent form) and at least probably related to the research  (with the exception of patient death, 
which is always reported) . Reportable events must be reported to the CSMC study team as soon as 
possible but no later than 10 business days from the relying site’s awareness of the event. The CSMC 
study team must submit the event in CS -IRB as soon as possible but no later than 10 business days from 
the CSMC study team ’s awareness of the event, via a Reportable New Information (RNI) form in CS -IRB, 
selecting the most appropriate type of report, and including copi[INVESTIGATOR_519538].   
 DSMB reporting: All SAEs possibly related to the study and all patient deaths will be summarized and 
reported to the DSMB at three time points : initial, interim, final.  Ad hoc review may take place if there 
is a study -related SAE.  
Patient deaths that the study team becomes aware of during the follow- up period, regardless of the 
relationship to the study, must be reported to the CSMC study team  as soon as possible but within  [ADDRESS_673966] 2023

 51 8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS   
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems (UPs) as defined by [CONTACT_31279] ( OHRP).  OHRP considers unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following 
criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the  characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_519610] ); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
UPs may or may not be AEs/SAEs.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_673972]. Danovitch will report UPs to the CSMC 
Institutional UPs that do not otherwise meet the definition of an AE/SAE (e.g., breach of confidentiality 
or privacy, unresolved patient complaints, incarceratio n, new risks) will be recorded by [CONTACT_25733]’s study 
coordinator in the REDCap Reporting Form. Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or clinical designee will review the form and 
investigate each event further to ascertain: (1) nature of the event (disclosure, psychological dis tress, or 
physical harm), (2) type and degree of actual harm (potential, social/psychological, physical), (3) type 
and degree of potential harm (social/psychological, physical), (4) potential attribution to the research 
study, (5) potential contributing factors, and (6) potential for recurrence. The research team (the site PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1461], with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_57370]) will confer on how to handle the events, including discussing 
them with the CSMC IRB, if uncertainty exists. If disclosures of sensitive indiv idually identifiable 
information may have occurred outside the research team, the study will adhere to HIPAA and other 
relevant considerations.  
 
Completed UP Forms will be automatically sent through REDCap to [CONTACT_519648] and the CSMC study 
coordinator, who will review and notify the Cedars -Sinai IRB, the DSMB, and the study Project Officer as 
required and outlined below.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
Primary Hypotheses : 
Primary Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize that, compared to patients who receive usual care, patients in 
the START condition will be more likely to initiate MOUD while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Alternatively , our null 
hypothesis is that there will be no difference in likelihood of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519539].  
Primary E ndpoint 1 : Proportion of  patients in each arm who initiate MOUD prior to discharge, 
defined as use of any FDA -approved pharmacotherapy for OUD, including buprenorphine, naltrexone 
and methadone .   
 
Primary Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize that, compared to patients who receive usual care, patients in 
the START condition will be more likely to receive linkage to post- discharge MOUD care (i.e., attend at 
least one OUD -related care visit within 30 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] ). Alternatively, our null hypothesis 
is that there will be no difference in linkage to post -discharge MOUD care for patients in the START 
condition compared to those in UC condition.  
Primary E ndpoint 2 : Proportion of patients in each arm who attend at least one OUD -related care 
visit within 30 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . 
 
Secondary Hypotheses : 
Secondary Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize that, compared to patients who receive usual care, patients in 
the START condition will be more likely to receive addiction -focused discharge planning. Alternatively, 
our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in likelihood of receiving addiction -focused 
discharge planning between patients in the START and UC conditions.  
Secondary Endpoint 1 : Proportion of patients in each arm with an after- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519527] 
a date and time for a post -discharge addiction care appointment . 
 
Secondary Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize that, compared to patients who receive usual care, patients in 
the START condition will be more likely to receive MOUD treatment after discharge (i.e., initiate MOUD 
or continue MOUD treatment within 30 days following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]) . Alternatively, our null 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673974] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 53 hypothesis is that there will be no difference in likelihood of receiving MOUD treatment between 
patients in the START and UC conditions.  
 
Secondary Endpoint 2 : Proportion of patients in each arm who initiate MOUD or continue MOUD 
treatment within 30 days following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
Secondary Hypothesis 3 : We hypothesize that, compared to patients who receive usual care, patients in 
the START condition will be more likely to receive linkage to post- discharge medical care (i.e., complete 
at least one visit to an outpatient medical provider within 30 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] ). Alternatively, 
our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in linkage to post -discharge medical care for 
patients in the START condition compared to those in UC condition.  
 
Secondary Endpoint 3 : Proportion of patients in each arm who complete at least one visit to an 
outpatient medical provider within 30 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
Secondary Hypothesis 4 : We hypothesize that, compared to patients who receive usual care, patients in 
the START condition will be more likely to  significantly  reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_519540] (i.e., days of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_468073] 30 days  between discharge and follow -up). Alternatively, our null hypothesis is that 
there will be no difference in likelihood of reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_519541].  
 
Secondary Endpoint 4 : Mean ( or median , depending on distribution ) days of use in the past 30 days 
after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  – Adapted National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) . 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
In-patient MOUD  initiation:  A sample size of n=414 (allowing for 20% attrition) and adjusted type I error 
rate of 2.5% provides 84% power to detect an OR=2.[ADDRESS_673975] and UC arms, stratified on prior MOUD  use. Based on literature, 14% of UC patients who are 
MOUD -naïve initiate MOUD  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].5 Assuming the average of MOUD -naïve and MOUD -experienced 
in-patient MOUD  initiation rates is 20%, we have an adequate sample size and power to detect this 
increase of in-patient MOUD  initiation in the CCT arm (37%) compared to UC.5,59,61  
Linkage  to OUD Care : We base the sample size estimate on the linkage to care measure since the 
probabilities of successful linkage are lower than for in -patient MOUD  initiation. Linkage to care rates 
reported in the literature range between 10%- 17% in usual care settings. To err on the side of caution, 
we estimate linkage to care in UC for MOUD -naïve and MOUD -experienced to be 5% and 10%,5,59,61,94 
respectively, yielding an average of 7.5%. We hypothesize that at least 20% of patients randomized to 
the START  arm will link to OUD care (attend at least one OUD -related visit) within 30 days following 
discharge . Assuming a Bonferroni -corrected, two -sided type I error rate of 2.5% to adjust for two 
primary endpoints, we will enroll a minimum of 414 patients (207 in each intervention arm) to have 80% 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673976] this difference. This estimate includes an adjustment for up to 20% attrition. This effect 
size corresponds to a clinically meaningful odds ratio of 3.0. Prior studies in different settings have found 
larger effects,61,94,[ADDRESS_673977].  
Sample size calculations for the primary endpoints  were performed in PASS 14 using stratified Mantel-
Haenszel tests for two proportions between two groups,96 with strata defined as 50% MOUD -naïve and 
50% MOUD -experienced.61,94,95,97,[ADDRESS_673978] 
withdrawal from the study is not anticipated to be significant.  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR A NALYSES  
 
Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Population (i.e., all randomized participants)  will be included in 
analyses. Participants who complete the informed consent or part of the baseline interview but are not 
randomized will be excluded from analysis.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_673979] tests, as appropriate. 
Corresponding  confidence intervals will be reported in addition to p -values. The primary and secondary 
analyses will be performed for the intention -to-treat population, which consists of all randomized 
subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
 
Missing Data: Study endpoints are cross -sectional in time. Every effort will be made to obtain all 
necessary outcome and covariate data. We will use inverse probability weighting and multiple 
imputation (IPW -MI) to adjust for missing covariate data.[ADDRESS_673980] our comparisons 
using weights. MI will be used to impute intermittently missing data for study completers. We will not 
impute outcomes, but only covariates.   
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
Primary Endpoint Analyses : 
Unadjusted point estimates and confidence intervals for proportions and means will be reported by [CONTACT_519625]. Primary endpoints will be compared between arms by [CONTACT_6486] a 
multivariable logistic regression model to each that includes as independent variables: intervention arm, 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673981] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 55 prior MOUD  exposure and site, as well as relevant baseline characteristics as covariates, including age, 
insurance status (as a marker for income), race, and ethnicity. Additional covariates  that may be 
included are substance use severity, homelessness and length of index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as well as any 
other variables also thought to be associated with outcomes that demonstrated imbalance between 
treatment arms.[ADDRESS_673982] implementation. Odds ratios and their Bonferroni -adjusted  97.5% Wald 
confidence intervals will be reported for the two primary outcomes.  
Secondary Endpoint Analyses :  
Similar analyses as described for the primary endpoints will be performed for these secondary proportions outcomes, but instead reporting 95% confidence intervals. For Secondary Endpoint #4, a 
general linearized  model to number of days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_519542].  An appropriate link function will be identified and used 
based on the distribution of the outcome data.  
9.4.3  SAFETY ANALYSES  
N/A 
 
9.4.4  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
Intervention groups will  be compared on baseline characteristics  (e.g., demographics , mental health 
characteristics)  using descriptive statistics. Planned comparisons are below. Additional comparisons may 
be added to the statistical analysis plan.  
 
• Site 
• Age (mean, SD)  
• Assigned  Sex 
• Gender Identity  
• Ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino)  
• Race  
o Black/African American  
o White  
o Asian/Pac ific Islander  
o American Indian/Alaska Native  
o Multiple races  
o Other race  
• Insurance status  
• Homeless  
• Depression (PHQ) and anxiety (GAD)  
 
 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673983] an interim analys is on the second primary outcome (linkage  to post -discharge care ) 
when we have enrolled  [ADDRESS_673984] 
primary outcome -  medication initiation .  This revised analytic sample size  is based on the actual balance 
between those with and without prior MOUD use (our strata) as well as the actual attrition rate rather 
than  our hypothetical pre-study calculations , as well as  our desire to minimize participant burden .   
Including 288 patients in the interim analysis  allows for approximately n = 288  × 0.70  (actual attrition 
rate)  = 202, or ~68% , of our final analytic sample size for the linkage  outcome  (202/299). We will utilize 
an alpha -spending method100,101 to ensure that, should we continue the study until full enrollment , we 
control the family -wise type I error rate to be 2.5% for each outcome. Using a two -sided test, this 
approach will allow us to assess superiority of the intervention over the control or the control over the 
intervention. If we reject the null hypothesis  at the interim analysis, we will discontinue the study. 
Should we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the interim analysis, we will continue to full enrollment  
before conducting the  final analysis.   
9.4.[ADDRESS_673985] exploratory analyses to see if patient sex or gender, or race/ethnicity has an effect on primary 
outcomes or retention . Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals  will be calculated from 
interaction effects between treatment group and sex or gender from  the specified linear models for the 
primary and secondary outcome measures.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_673986] the following e xploratory 
analyses: (1) Assess the mediating effect of  inpatient  MOUD  initiation on use of MOUD  and linkage with 
OUD treatment post- discharge; (2) Assess the mediating effect of completion of an OUD -specific 
discharge plan on linkage with OUD treatment [ADDRESS_673987] -discharge ; (3) Assess the moderating effects 
of patient characteristics ( e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, insurance status) on  post -discharge  linkage. We 
will summarize bivariate relationships between site and patient characteristics. To evaluate how these 
relationships may affect endpoints, we will assess the i nteraction effects between site and these 
covariates from the logistic regression models described for the primary and secondary analyses.  
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673988] is time to linkage to care following discharge. A Cox proportional hazards model 
will be fitted to the time to linkage with intervention arm and other relevant baseline characteristics as 
covariates, including age, insurance status (as a marker for income), race, and ethnicity . Additional 
covariates identified for the primary and secondary analyses may also be included. The proportional 
hazards assumption will be assessed. The relative risk and 95% CI for the two arms will reported  and 
median times to linkage will be reported.

10.1.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
The NIH requires the establishment of DSMBs for multi -site clinical trials involving interventions that 
entail potential risks to the participants, even trials that pose little likelihood of harm. T his study's DSMB 
will be established through the UCLA Data and Safety Monitoring Board for Addiction Medicine (DSMB-
AM, led by [CONTACT_519627]).  
The UCLA DSMB -AM will monitor throughout the entire course of the study, specifically during the 
period that involves any human involvement (e.g. , enrollment stage, during course of study treatment, 
throughout any follow -up assessments, etc.). The DSMB -AM will conduct an initial review at the 
beginning of study, when the team will be applying for Institutional Review Board approval. After that, 
they  will hold annual interim reviews. Once all data collection for human subjects is complete, the 
DSMB -AM will c onduct a final review. The DSMB- AM will reserve the right to request additional interim 
reviews, in the unlikely instance that there is an increased risk during the course of the study.  
The DSMB -AM includes experts in all scientific disciplines needed to interpret the data and ensure 
patient safety, including addition experts, clinical trial experts, biostatisticians, and bioethicists. DSMB 
members will have no association with the projec t investigators, and no conflicts of interest with study 
outcomes. DSMB procedures will conform with usual standards, including reviewing emerging trial data 
and maintaining confidentiality. DSMB members will serve the following functions: (1) reviewing th e 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_673997] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 61 research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring; (2) monitoring data quality, timeliness, 
recruitment, retention, performance across study sites, and factors that may affect the risks and 
benefits of the study such as emerging literature; and (3 ) making recommendations regarding 
continuation of the trial.  
10.1.7 CLINICAL MONITORING  
N/A 
 
10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 
Informed consent  — Study staff at each site will review both the documentation of the consenting 
process as well as a percentage of the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate 
compliance with GCP, accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the larger study team 
to ensure proper consenting procedures are followed .  
 
Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are described in 
Section 6.2.1, Interventionist Training and Tracking .  
 
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will 
implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of 
concern.  Section 9.5.10 provides information on protocol deviations and reporting.  
Data – PI [INVESTIGATOR_519545], including 
evaluating data for adherence with the protocol and for accuracy. Site queries will occur every [ADDRESS_673998] accrual and retention, as well as completeness of data. These will be used to identify and resolve 
problems that may arise. Data extracted from each site’s electronic medical record will be uploaded to 
the UNM SDCC via  secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) and checked monthly during the study . Follow -up 
survey data will be entered directly into REDCap . Under the direction of a statistician, a quantitative 
analyst will check the data for completeness  and accuracy .  
Should independent monitoring become necessary, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_92200]- related 
sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_103] /funding agency , and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].

Data Management  
Data will be collected from multiple sources throughout the course of the study. All prospectively 
collected data will be directly entered into the UNM REDCap electronic data capture system which is administered by [CONTACT_519628] e Center (CTSC). The UNM Statistics and Data 
Coordinating Center (SDCC) will develop electronic data collection forms of the patient interviews in 
REDCap and will maintain access rights to the database. All data will be stored on UNM HSC’s secured 
servers and behind their firewall. Other data sent to UNM will be transferred via SFTP  following all 
institutional policies and executed data use agreements. Data to be curated by [CONTACT_519629]:  
• Potentially eligible participants will be identified from reports generated from the electronic 
medical record (EMR) 3 -5 times per week by [CONTACT_30107]’ informatics teams. These reports will be 
restricted to admitted patients who meet the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5 . 
• Consent forms obtained electronically may be sent to participants by [CONTACT_519595].   
• Baseline and outcome interview data will be collected by [CONTACT_519630] -up interview data will be collected by [CONTACT_519631]. All data  will be directly 
entered into the UNM SDCC’s REDCap system.  
• In the event that the UNM SDCC’s REDCap system  cannot be accessed, the sites may enter data 
in a copy of the project on their local REDCap system or utilize paper forms. In these cases, the 
data  will be merged  into the the UNM SDCC’s REDCap system  when it becomes available, either 
by [CONTACT_519632].  
• Additional outcome data will be obtained from the sites’ EMR  and will be retrieved by [CONTACT_519633]. This data will be sent to the UNM SDCC via SFTP and will be merged with the 
other study data.  
Data Storage  
• All study data will be stored in a REDC ap database behind UNM Health Science Center’s (HSC) 
firewall on a secured and encrypted password protected server following UNM HSC data

 63 security policies. Any identifiable information (such as contact [CONTACT_519634]) will be stored in a  REDCap database (“project”) in an encrypted format behind a 
firewall on UNM’s secured servers and is accessible only to designated personnel on a case -by-
case basis. The UNM data center is staffed with onsite security personnel 24x7x365 and 
provides multi level physical and logical security protection including: monitoring, video 
surveillance, biometric and access card and man -trap acce ss to datacenter floor, encrypted and 
password protected servers, and restricted logical access, with a dedicated and encrypted data 
drive behind a firewall. Access to the data is provided only to authorized users through an 
encrypted transmission channel with a password -protected application interface.  UNM will 
store all data on their secured servers for up to [ADDRESS_674002] data need to be received  by [CONTACT_519635], it will be uploaded to REDCap and 
paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_417740].  Should paper collection of study data or forms need to be 
utilized, they will be destroyed once they are confirmed to be in the electronic system.   
Additionally, all deidentified analysis data sets will be transmitted via S FTP to the Principal 
Investigators at the participating sites  for additional analyses where the data will be stored 
behind their institution’s firewalls on password -protected and encrypted servers.  
Responsibility for Data Safety and Monitoring 
The study team will monitor the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Data 
safeguarding procedures will adhere to standards established by [CONTACT_519636], the Department of Health and Human Se rvices, local HIPAA regulations, and standards set 
by [CONTACT_451284] -Sinai Institutional Review Board.  
As Co -PIs, Drs. Itai Danovitch and Allison Ober carry ultimate responsibility for ensuring compliance with 
the trial Protocol as well as the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. [CONTACT_519650] at Cedars -Sinai will be 
tasked with overseeing compliance with procedu res for human subjects' protections as well as data and 
safety monitoring, under the guidance of Drs. Ober and Danovitch. Researchers at the University of New 
Mexico SDCC will be responsible for monitoring the data quality and completeness, and ensuring th e 
integrity of descriptive and statistical analyses. All of these investigators have extensive experience in 
handling sensitive information.  
To monitor data and safety issues, this team will meet regularly throughout the study project, enabling 
any concerns to be addressed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. We will monitor reasons that patients give for declining to 
participate in the study, as well as reasons for stopp ing their study participation after initially giving 
consent. Drs. Ober and Danovitch will report to the Cedars -Sinai Institutional Review Board, the single 
IRB for the project, through annual progress reports. Site investigators also will report to their local IRB, as required by [CONTACT_9906].

 64 All study records  will be retained for a minimum of 7 years (as required for NIH -funded studies) after the 
formal discontinuation the study intervention . These documents will be retained  for a longer period, 
however, if required by [CONTACT_427].  For research data and materials involving Protected Health 
Information (PHI), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_519546] (6) years beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_519547] (i.e. the consent form or  authorization).  
10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
This protocol defines a protocol deviation  (PD)  as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, 
International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), Protocol ) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. Examples 
of protocol deviations may include enrollment of an ineligible subject, follow -up interview conducted out -
of-window, or a START member seeing a usual care patient.  
 These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
 Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
 Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
 Section 5.20 Noncompliance, subsections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 
PDs will be recorded by [CONTACT_25733]’s study coordinator in the REDCap Reporting Form. Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or 
clinical designee  will review the form and investigate each event further to ascertain: (1) nature of the 
event ( subject eligibility , consent process ), (2) type and degree of potential or actual harm 
(social/psychological), ( 3) potential contributing factors, and ( 4) potential for recurrence. The research 
team will confer on how to handle the events, including discussing them with the IRB, if uncertainty exists.  
Further details about the handling of protocol deviations are included in the MOP.  
Completed PD Forms will be automatically sent through REDCap to D r. Danovitch  and the CSMC study 
coordinator, who will review and notify the  Cedars -Sinai IRB, the DSMB , and the study Project Officer  as 
required and outlined below .  
IRB reporting: The site PIs  and [CONTACT_519648], will assist in determining whether the deviation must be 
reported to the Cedars -Sinai IRB. A minor logistical deviation (e.g., an out -of-window study visit or 
procedure, a missed weekly phone check -in) does not need to be reported to the IR B. A protocol 
deviation must be reported to the IRB if the study investigator s determine it poses a threat to the 
integrity of the study or if the deviation impacts participant rights, safety, or welfare. For example, 
deviati ons related to subject eligibility or consent procedures (e.g., patient enrolled despi[INVESTIGATOR_519548], consent not obtained prior to study start, consent obtained by [CONTACT_519637], incorrect version of consent form used) must be  reported.  Reportable events must be 
reported by [CONTACT_519638]  10 business days 
from the relying site’s  awareness of the event.  The CSMC study team must submit the event in CS -IRB as 
START   Version 1. [ADDRESS_674004] 2023  
  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 65 soon as possible but no later than  10 business days from  the CSMC  study team’s awareness of the event, 
via a Reportable New Information (RNI) form  in CS -IRB, selecting the most appropriate type of report, 
and including copi[INVESTIGATOR_519549].  
In the event that the protocol exception needs to be requested  to accommodate a single subject, the 
CSMC  IRB must be notified in advance. Deviations made to avoid immediate hazard to a participant 
must be reported to the CSMC IRB within [ADDRESS_674005] be 
reported within 10 business days.  
DSMB reporting: All PDs will be summarized and reported to the DSMB at three timepoints: At three 
time points during data collection, when the enrollment reaches one -third (N=137), two -thirds (N=272), 
and upon completion (N=414) .  
NIH reporting:  PDs that require IRB reporting (as described above) will be reported to the project officer 
by [CONTACT_49907] 10 business days.

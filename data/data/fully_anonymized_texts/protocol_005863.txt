Document Date: 8/17/[ADDRESS_1182457] of Medicaid Health Homes  on patients with diabetes  
8/17/2020  
1)Objectives
We plan to examine  the effects  of New  York  State’s  (NYS)  Medicaid  Health  Home  (HHs)  program  (a
population -targeted  intervention  at the state  level) on the process  of care , outcomes,  and racial/ethnic
disparities among  low-income  residents of [LOCATION_001]  City (NYC)  with Type  II diabetes  mellitus.   In 2012,
NYS Medicaid  initiated  HHs with  the “triple  aim”  of 1) improving  quality,  2) improving  outcomes,  and 3)
reducing  costs  of care  for high -need  patients  with  chronic  diseases.  The program was designed  to
enhance  care  and outcomes  for patients  with  two or more  chronic  conditions,  such  as diabetes  and
coronary disease,  HIV, and/or  a serious  mental health  condition.   HHs provide  these  patients  with
coordination  of care, by [CONTACT_850574],  social service  agencies,
community -based  organizations, and  health  insurance  plans.  Taken  together, the roll-out, timing,
scope  of the program,  which  currently  serves  over  60,[ADDRESS_1182458]  long -standing  racial 
and ethnic  disparities  in the quality  of care  and outcomes  of individuals  with  diabetes.  Since  similar 
programs  are being  implemented  nationally,  it now  is critically  important to evaluate  the effects  of 
HHs on the process and  outcomes  among patients with diabetes,  a condition  with  multiple  
complications, which  are disproportionately  prevalent  among  racial and  ethnic  minorities  and low-
income  populations  in the United  States.  
We plan  to use  two complementary sources  of longitudinal  individual -level  data:  1) NYS Medicaid  
administrative  and claims  data  and 2) the New  York  City-Clinical Data  Research  Network  (NYC -CDRN),  
funded  by [CONTACT_33230] -Centered  Outcomes  Research  Institute  (PCORI).  The NYC-CDRN  has identifie d a 
cohort  of patients  with  diabetes (approximately 90,700  Medicaid  enrollees  with  diabetes) from [ADDRESS_1182459]  data; and  it has developed  a common  data  model that  
includes  clinical variables  related  to the proces s and outcomes  of care  of patients  with  diabetes.   Using  
information  available  from the  two complementary data  sources  and quasi -experimental methods, we 
will assess  the impact of Medicaid  HHs in NYC.   
 Among  adult  Medicaid  patients  with  diabetes  in NYC,  we propose:  
Aim 1: To assess  the impact of HHs on the process  of care  for patients  with  diabetes.   
Aim 2: To assess  the impact  of HHs on the health  outcomes of patients  with  diabetes.  
2 Aim 3:  To assess  the impact of HHs on racial and  ethnic  disparities  in the process  of care  and outcomes  
among  Medicaid  patients  with  diabetes.  
Our sample  will include  Medicaid  enrollees  with  diabetes  who  are seen  at NYC-CDRN  sites  and in HHs 
(estimated  6,500-20,000 ) and a matched  comparison  group  of Medicaid  enrollees  with diabetes  who  are 
part of the NYC-CDRN,  but not HHs.  We plan  to develop  a set  of propensity  score matched  controls, 
based on a  set of patient,  practice, and  market -level (zip -code)  characteristics.  We will use quasi -
experimental methods  to investigate the magnitude  of the effects  of the HHs program between  2010 
and 2017 . This secondary data analysis is referred to as Activity 1  in this protocol. In addition, we will 
gather information regarding the patient  experience of HHs through interviews (Activity 2 ). We will also 
utilize interviews with HH leaders and care managers from NYC HHs to further characterize these entities 
(Activity 3 ). Columbia University will participate in only Activity 1 .   
8/20/20 update: Apart from evaluating the impact of the NYS Med icaid HH program on the process and 
outcomes of care for low -income NYC residents with diabetes, compared to non -enrolled residents with 
similar conditions and utilization histories, we have received funding to extend this work to examine the 
impacts of th e COVID -[ADDRESS_1182460] access and utilization of health care and 
social services and health outcomes among HH enrollees and non -enrollees during a baseline period 
prior to the pa ndemic (CY2019) with each month of the pandemic time period (2020).  
Aim 4:  Using Medicaid claims data, we will estimate the impact of HH enrollme nt compared to usual 
care among Medicaid -insured patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions on acces s to health 
care and social services and COVID -19 and non -COVID -19 clinical outcomes, as well as racial/ethnic 
disparities in these outcomes, before and during the pandemic in NYC.  
Using Medicaid claims  only , we will identify HH participants with diabetes  living in NYC in 2019, and use 
matching and weighting methods to develop a non -HH comparison group who were similar to HH 
enrollees in their demographics, comorbidities and utilization histories. We will then conduct difference -
in-differences analyses usi ng an “event study” framework to compare the pre -COVID time period 
(CY2019) to each month of the post -COVID period (2020) in terms of access, utilization, and clinical 
outcomes between the HH and matched non -HH group, overall and stratified by [CONTACT_545]/ethnici ty (Activity 
4).  
2)Background
Diabetes Prevalence  
Type II diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease, with an overall prevalence of 9.3% in the US (1). 
In [LOCATION_001] City (NYC), the overall prevalence of diabetes is somewhat higher, 10.8%; and, the 
prevalence  of diabetes are higher among racial and ethnic minoritie s, compared to Whites (2):  among 
Hispanics, the prevalence is 15.2%; among non -Hispanic Blacks 12.8%; and, among non -Hispanic Whites 
7.1%. (3)  The prevalence of diabetes also is higher among those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), 
3 compared to those of higher SES: among those living at <100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) the 
prevalence is 14.8%; and, among the highest  income group (>/=600% FPL) 4.7%. (3) 
Diabetes Complications  
The complications of diabetes impact health and well -being.  In addition to the direct metabolic 
consequences, diabetes increases the long -term risk of cardio -renal diseases, including coronary heart 
disease, stroke, heart failure, renal disease, retinopathy and blindness; and these complications 
contribute to health disparities.  In NYC, mortality related to diabetes is significantly higher among non -
Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics and among individuals living in high -poverty neighborhoods, compared to 
non-Hispanic Whites and those living in low -poverty neighb orhoods respectively. (4) Individuals living in 
high -poverty neighborhoods also have higher rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850562] -related 
complications. (5)  
Diabetes care  
In order to improve health care and outcomes, reduce costs, and address health disparities related to 
diabetes, a number of health care interventions have been implemented by [CONTACT_850575], many focused on care management and care coordination. Increasingly, as health 
systems are incentivized to address health on a population level, interventions are also designed to 
address health determinants outside of the health care system, such as social and environmental factors 
and health behavior, through collaboration with community -based organizations (CBOs).  Prior research 
among racially and ethnically diverse populations has shown that care management interventions 
delivered by [CONTACT_21108], registered nurses, community health workers, and endocrinologists 
can improve intermediate outcomes, such as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). (6-9) However, evidence does not 
presently exist on the long -term outcomes of care management and care coordination for patients with 
diabetes. Peek et al. describe many interventions that involve community -health system p artnerships. 
Examples include clinics working with community -health workers, physician -referrals to community -
based education, food “prescription” programs, and the integration of community -based resources into 
broad quality improvement initiatives. (10) While evaluations of some of these ha ve shown promising 
effects on intermediate outcomes, there is little data about the overall effects of such interventions to 
date, especially in large, diverse, urban settings.  
Medical homes  
Care management and community -health system partnerships common ly exist within the patient -
centered medical home (PCMH) model. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) defines 
the PCMH as a model of care that offers comprehensive care of each patient’s physical and mental 
health through a team of provider s, is patient -centered, coordinates care across the health system, 
provides accessible services, and engages in continual quality and safety improvement evaluation and 
activities. (11) Consensus principles of the  PCMH, building on the backdrop of 40 years of primary -care 
practice redesign, were established in 2007 by [CONTACT_129619], the American 
Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Osteopathic 
Assoc iation. (12) A growing number of p roviders are part of PCMHs, serving several million patients. (13, 
14)However, there are large variations in the definition, and implementation of the PCMH. (15) This
variatio n has made it difficult to assess the impact of the PCMH on quality of care  and clinical outcomes .
Affordable Care Act and Medicaid Health Homes 
[ADDRESS_1182461] (ACA) of 2010, “health homes” were 
authorized for  care management and coordination for individuals enrolled in Medicaid. Under the ACA, 
six health home services are eligible for reimbursement: comprehensive care management, care 
coordination and health promotion, comprehensive transitional care, patient and family support, 
referral to community and social support services, and use of health information technology to link 
services. (16) As such, the Medicaid Health Home (HH) includes interventions previously tested among 
individuals with diabetes. However, the payment reforms associated with these new care delivery 
mechanisms add another aspect  to the intervention. In addition, these types of interventions are now 
being expanded to include a larger patient population - those eligible for HHs. In order to be included in a 
HH, patients need to have chronic conditions, including serious mental illne ss, substance use disorders, 
or multiple chronic diseases, including diabetes. As of November 2014, 20 states had approved plans for 
HHs. (17)  
[LOCATION_001] State (NYS) established a Medicaid Health Home program in 2012, with the [LOCATION_001] State 
Health Home State Plan Amendment (SPA). In [LOCATION_001] State at the end of 2014, over 5 million low -
income individuals were enrolled in Medicaid, including over 3 million of NYC’s estimated 8.4 million 
residents. (18, 19)  The State estimated in 2012 that approximately 1 mill ion individuals would be eligible 
for the HH program, including 418,677 Medicaid recipi[INVESTIGATOR_850563], and 386,399 participants with other chronic conditions. HHs were rolled out in three phases 
during 2012, with Phase I  in January (which included the Bronx and Kings (Brooklyn) Counties), Phase II 
in April (which included [LOCATION_001] (Manhattan), Queens and Richmond (Staten Island), the remaining 
counties in NYC), and Phase III in July. (20) As of August 2014, 40,776 individuals were enrolled in 
NYC. (21, 22)  Around 35,000 Medicaid enrollees across NYS were part of precursor care management 
programs (including the Office of Mental Health’s Targeted Case Management Program (for those with 
severe mental illness), Managed Addictio n Treatment Services Program, and the Comprehensive 
Medicaid Case Management Program (for people living with HIV/AIDS), which are all in the process of 
converting to HHs. (16)   
The identification of individuals eligible for HHs is initiated by [CONTACT_850576]: a NYS Department 
of Health (DOH) predictive algorithm utilizing Medicaid servi ces data, which prioritizes individuals based 
on risk of future hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and community or “bottom up” referrals from healthcare providers, 
community -based care management providers, including harm reduction providers, and other agencies 
such as tho se who serve individuals re -entering the community from jail or prison. Enrollment in HHs 
has been slower than expected, and several challenges have been identified and are being addressed by 
[CONTACT_850577]. These include inaccuracies in the lists of targeted  individuals, challenges in the 
recruitment process, and individuals electing not to participate in the program. (16) The new program 
may put stress on already under -resourced facilities, by [CONTACT_850578], the 
requirements around health information technology (HIT), the caseloads of facilities and case managers, 
and, in s ome cases, lowering reimbursement for care management services. Another significant change 
brought about by [CONTACT_850579] g with HIV/AIDS, substance use 
disorders, or serious mental illness (P. Schafer, personal communication, March 9, 2015).   
Medicaid Health Homes and Diabetes Management  
HH-eligible patients with diabetes are likely to be an especially vulnerable populatio n, and one where 
disparities in access and quality are starker. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with serious 
5 
 mental illness (SMI) is higher than in the general population. Increased mortality among those with SMI 
is partially attributable to high er rates of cardio -metabolic disease. (23, 24)  Patients with SMI and 
diabetes have been found to be less likely to receive indicated services and care, and more likely to be 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_850564] -care sensitive conditions when compared to those without 
SMI. (23, 25)  Over half of patients with diabetes have at least one other chronic condition, and a large 
proportion of these have two or more. (26, 27)  Suffering from multiple chronic disease s puts individuals 
at greater risk of preventable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], poor functional status, higher cost care, and increased 
mortality. (26, 28)  
 
HH enrollment would ideally improve the processes and the outcomes of care; and it would reduce 
health disparities (related to the process and outcomes of care) for individuals with diabetes. Through 
coordination of care, intensive case management, and att ention to social needs, individuals with 
diabetes could develop better disease self -management, receive proper specialist evaluation and 
evidence -based regimens, and work with a team that identifies opportunities to bolster social support.   
As the HH inte rvention is applied differently at different facilities, these effects may vary across 
institutions. In NYS, evaluations are currently being conducted of the overall HHs program and of those 
participants with substance use disorders and those with HIV; how ever, by [CONTACT_850580], the proposed research would add substantially to knowledge about the effect of HHs on 
patients on an important common chronic condition, diabetes.  
 
Impact of COVID -19 on Medicaid Health Homes  
 
In spring 2020,  [LOCATION_001] City (NYC) was the American epi[INVESTIGATOR_850565] -[ADDRESS_1182462] health effects, the pandemic also had major impacts on the delivery of health care and social 
services. Low -income patients with diabetes, especially among raci al/ethnic minorities, are more 
vulnerable to the serious morbidity and mortality associated with COVID -19; and, they are more likely to 
experience a lack of access to health care and social services. Outpatient medical care essentially shut 
down for in -person visits during the pandemic, and access to primary care, disease management, and 
medications continue to be disrupted. Limited mobility and social determinants, such as access to 
transportation, employment, internet connectivity, and competing needs, al so likely impacted access to 
health care and social services and clinical outcomes during the pandemic. In response, [LOCATION_001] State 
(NYS) Medicaid adapted regulations to allow Health Homes (HHs) to bill for remote delivery of care 
management services. As a  result, HH participants are likely to have higher rates of health care and 
social service utilization and better health outcomes, compared to similar HH non -participants . 
 
The proposed study will be among the first to utilize the [LOCATION_001] City Clinical Da ta Research Network 
(NYC -CDRN) data and infrastructure to examine the effects of a population -level health policy, the 
implementation of the Medicaid HH program, on the process, outcomes, and disparities of care for a 
common chronic condition, diabetes.   
 
3) Setting of the Human Research  
 
The primary research team is located at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Other members of 
the team are located at Weill Cornell Medicine and the [LOCATION_001] Academy of Medicine  (NYAM) (Co -PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_850566]) . NYAM i s a non -profit center of interdisciplinary research, evaluation, policy, and 
6 
 program initiatives focused on urban health.  The study is a collaboration with the [LOCATION_001] City Clinical 
Data Research Network  and the HEAL at NYU School of Medicine.  
 
The [LOCATION_001] City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC -CDRN) was founded with support from the 
Patient -Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to join its PCORnet program. The mission of the 
NYC-CDRN is to create an accessible, sustainable, scalable clinical d ata network to facilitate patient -
centered research, learning healthcare systems and a national research network (PCORnet). Efforts  are 
focused  on five goals:  
1. Creating thoughtful privacy policies that protect the identities of individual patients, 
clinicia ns, and health systems;  
2. Establishing a de -identified database with clinical data on at least one million New 
Yorkers;  
3. Engaging patients, caregivers, and clinicians in network governance and decision -making;  
4. Embedding research activities in the delivery of healthcare to minimize the burden on 
patients, clinicians, and health systems; and  
5. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a high -functioning, sustainable governance structure.  
 
NYC-CDRN’s program builds on the joint efforts of 22 organizations – including academic medical 
centers, as sociated Clinical and Translational Science Centers, federally qualified health centers, regional 
health information organizations (RHIOs), research institutions, consumer advocacy groups and 
government agencies - to develop a patient -centered, sustainable  network for conducting research 
across [LOCATION_001] City and the nation and facilitating a learning healthcare system.  
 
The Health Evaluation and Analytics Lab (HEAL)  promotes applied research to help health sector 
organizations evaluate initiatives that seek  to improve health outcomes among populations and to 
improve health care delivery practices.  HEAL has built a unique [LOCATION_001] State Medicaid claims file. 
This large data system allows for a wide range of evaluative work focused on improving care and 
outco mes for the most vulnerable [LOCATION_001]ers, who rely on Medicaid to pay for their medical care 
needs. The data set also allows providers to better track the services received by [CONTACT_75054]. The 
effort to create the claims file analytical system was financ ially supported by [CONTACT_850581].

4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
Our study team  includes multiple experienced investigators, a data analyst, experienced project 
management staff, and an experienced engagement manager. This team has the knowledge and 
resources need ed to conduct the retrospective cohort analysis, focus grou ps, and HH leader 
interviews. ISMMS has robust data management and security protocols in place to safely store study 
data. For this study, we will be working with the NYC -CDRN, which, as described above, has the 
resources to combine data from multiple inst itutions and facilitate collaboration , and to ensure data 
security and quality.  
 
Activity 2:  The primary team at ISMMS will collaborate with partner institutions to conduct  
interviews . Investigators and stakeholders from the partner institution s will advi se the primary team 
on reaching out to clinical providers , care management agencies, and HHs  about contact[CONTACT_850582]. The primary team will reach out to and follow up with these providers.  Then, the primary 
team will reach out to eligible particip ants. The primary team will conduct all interviews .  
 
 
5) Study Design  
a) Recruitment Methods  
Activity 1: For this retrospective data analysis, we will not be recruiting any participants.  The 
study will rely upon a distributed query of the participating healthca re systems in the NYC -
CDRN. For a full description of query design, see section f for Activity 1. The protocol relies 
upon the NYC -CDRN infrastructure established under the BRANY IRB -approved protocol #14 -
02-95-380 (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_850567]) to accomplish the data aggr egation.  
8 
 Activity 2:   
Health Home patients will be recruited through referral from HH care managers. Care 
managers will share a flyer (created by [CONTACT_3476]) describing the study with patients. If 
patients are interested, the care manager will add thei r contact [CONTACT_850583]. Study staff will follow up via phone. If the 
participant is reached via phone and interested in participating, study staff will provide 
further information about the interv iew process and content and will schedule the 
phone/virtual interview.  
 
Activity 3:  In order to identify  leaders from HH s in NYC, we will utilize multiple sources 
including internet sites for each  HH listing name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_850584], referrals from our Patient and Stakeholder Advisory Board (of which one 
member is a leader of a NYC HH and thus familiar with many of these individuals), from 
interviewees who have already participated, and HH forums.  Study staff will rea ch out to 
individuals by [CONTACT_850585]. If potential participants are interested, 
the study staff member will set up a telephone  or video  meeting, during which verbal consent 
will be obtained prior to any data collection.  
Health Hom e directors that are study stakeholders and partners will assist with the 
identification of HH care managers and will share contact [CONTACT_850586]. Study staff will follow up via email 
or via phone. If the participant is reached and interested in participating, study staff will 
provide further information about the interview process and content and will schedule the 
phone/virtual interview.  
 
Activity 4:  For this retrospective data analysi s, we will not be recruiting any participants  We plan to 
use NYS Medicaid administrative and claims data in the Medicaid Data Warehouse, available to 
researchers at HEAL at [LOCATION_001] University.  
 
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Activity 1: For this analys is, the study cohort will consist of patients who: 1) have Type II diabetes, 
2) are  insured by [CONTACT_5556], and 3) are either part of a Health Home or meet criteria for Health Home 
enrollment, but are not enrolled in a Health Home.  
1) In consultation with the  Diabetes Subcommittee of the NYC -CDRN, this protocol will use the 
SUPREME -DM definition of diabetes, which has been previously validated. (29) This definition has 
been adopted as a standard across the three CDRNs th at have diabetes as a disease focus ([LOCATION_001], 
Louisiana, and Oregon -Advance). It consists of the following algorithm (see Table 1), where any of the 
listed criteria are sufficient for inclusion for any patient with at least one outpatient visit at a 
parti cipating CDRN site within the past year.

2) In order to be elig ible for the cohort, subjects need to have been insured by [CONTACT_850587] [ADDRESS_1182464] been insured by [CONTACT_5556].  
3) Subjects who have participated in the HH program will be the treatment group in this 
study. Medicaid data contains a field that will i dentify those patients who were a part of this 
program during the study period.  Our compa rison group will consist of similar individuals 
who were not part of the HH progra m. The comparison group will be constructed of patients 
who have been propensity score matched to those in the treatment group, and are therefore 
similar on a number of chara cteristics.  
 
Activity 2: For the focus group  and interview  aspect of this study, we will be conducting [ADDRESS_1182465] of only individual in terviews. Inclusion criteria are as 
follows:  
a. English -speaking  
b. Are enrolled in a HH  
c. [ADDRESS_1182466] be able to 
speak with a study staff member over the phone /video cal l.  All individuals must be able to 
communicate  in English.  
 
The ISMMS study team  will coordinate with stakeholders who lead NYC HHs to engage HH 
members/patients who are potential participants.

 Activity 3:  HH leaders:  In order to participate in this p ortion of the study, individuals must 
speak English and be in a leadership position at a HH entity in NYC or a NYC HH -affiliated C are 
Management Agency (CMA) . Other than not meeting the inclusion criteria, there are no 
exclusion criteria.  
Care managers:  In order to participate in this portion of the study, individuals must speak 
English and be in care manager position with a NYC HH -affiliated Care Management Agency 
(CMA). Other than not meeting the inclusion criteria, there are no exclusion criteria.  
 
Activ ity 4:  For this analysis, the study cohort will consist of patients who: 1) have Type II diabetes, 2) 
are insured by [CONTACT_5556], and  3) are either part of a Health Home or meet criteria for Health Home 
enrollment, but are not enrolled in a Health Home.  These  criteria will be determined using only 
Medicaid claims data.   
 
 
 
c) Number of Subjects  
Activity 1:  Estimated sample size of 51,000 patients.  
Activity 2:  20-40 participants in year 5. 
Activity 3:  Approximately 1 0-30 participants (HH leadership  and CMA leaders hip, care 
managers ). 
Activity 4:  Estimated sample size of 60,000 patients  
 
d) Study Timelines  
Activity 1: This is a retrospective cohort analysis. We will examine two data sets: one with 
data from [ADDRESS_1182467] has been funded from 
3/1/2016 -2/28/2021.  
Activity 2: We complet ed our year 2 focus groups and interviews by 8/31/2018  and we 
anticipate completing year 5focus groups by 2/[ADDRESS_1182468] of

Activity 4 : We anticipated conducting primary analyses by 6/30/2021.  
 
e) Variable and endpoints  
Activity 1  and 4 : For this aspect of the study, we will examine multiple endpoints related to 
process of care, outcomes, and racial/ ethnic disparities. We will examine variable and 
endpoints in the following categories:  
1) Individual level characteristics  
Variables include gender, age, race/ethnicity, health insurance type, health care site, patient zip  
code, and tobacco use.  
 
2) Health hom e indicators and patient co -morbidities  
11 
 Indicators available include whether the individual was enrolled in the HH program, the date of 
joining the program, the name/location of the HH, patient -level co -morbidities and chronic 
conditions (additional diagno ses).  
 
3) Process measures  
In consultation with the Diabetes Subcommittee of the NYC -CDRN, the following process 
measures have been identified (see Table 2). Several organizations in the [LOCATION_002] have 
developed sets of quality metrics that can be used t o evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness 
of processes of care and outcomes for patients with diabetes. These include the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Pharmacy Quality Alliance (PQA), the National 
Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)’s Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set 
(HEDIS), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) Prevention Quality 
Indicators (PQI) (which assess the quality of care for “ambulatory care sensitive conditions,” also 
known as preventable admissions). (30-33) 
 
Table 2. Process Measures  
Metric  Component

Medications (CMS)  At least two prescriptions for statins and a Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) of at least 
0.8 dur ing the measurement period (12 consecutive months)  
Adherence to Chronic 
Medications (CMS)  At least two prescriptions for ACEIs/ARBs and a PDC of at least 0.8 during the 
measurement period (12 consecutive months).  
Adherence to Chronic 
Medications (CMS)  At least two prescriptions for a single oral hypoglycemic agent or at least two 
prescriptions for multiple agents within an antidiabetic class and a PDC of at least 0.[ADDRESS_1182469] 1 antidiabetic class during the measurement period (12 consecutive 
months).  
Eye Exam (NCQA)  Received a retinal or dilated eye exam during the measurement year or a negative 
retinal or dilated eye exam in the year prior to the measurement year.  
HbA1c testing (NCQA)  Received an HbA1c test during the measurement year.  
LDL-C Screen ing 
(NCQA)  Received an LDL -C test during the measurement year.  
Medical Attention for 
Nephropathy (NCQA)  Received a nephropathy screening test or had evidence of nephropathy during the 
measurement year.  
Appropriate Treatment 
of Hypertension (PQA)  If dispe nsed a medication for diabetes and hypertension , are receiving an angiotensin -
converting -enzyme -inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or direct 
renin inhibitor (DRI) renin -angiotensin -antagonist medication.  
Foot exam (NCQA)  Received a fo ot exam (visual inspection with either a sensory exam or a pulse exam) 
during the measurement year.  
 
4) Outcome measures  
In consultation with the Diabetes Subcommittee of the NYC -CDRN, the following outcome 
measures have been identified (see table below). As with the identified process measures, these 
are metrics identified and developed by [CONTACT_850588], which means that 
results will be readily interpretable by [CONTACT_850589]. (30) 
 
In order to assess these metrics, and to perform individual -level longitudinal analyses, we will 
evaluate health system utilization and intermediate and long term outcomes.  Outcomes will 
include:   
12 
 1) Intermediate outcomes :HbA1c, blood p ressure, LDL and renal function  
2) Long -term outcomes:  we will use validated ICD -9 code based -algorithms to assess  
a. macrovascular outcomes (stroke  and myocardial infarction)  
b. microvascular outcomes (nephropathy, end -stage renal disease, neuropathy, 
amputati on, retinopathy, and blindness)  
3) Utilization outcomes :  
a. Number and diagnoses associated with diabetes -related preventable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  
i. uncontro lled diabetes admissions  
ii. diabetes short -term complications admissions (diabetic ketoac idosis, 
hyperosmolarity, coma)  
iii. and long -term complications admissions (renal, eye, neurologic al, and 
circulatory disorders)  
b.  ER visits  
c.  Outpatient visits.

Activity 2: For this qualitative research, we will  identify  cross -cutting themes from 
interviews.  
Activity 3:  Data collected through these interviews will be utilized to categorize HH , CMA, 
and care manager activities and experiences.  
 
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
This is a mixed -methods study that will utilize  a retrospective  cohort design, as well as 
qualitative focus groups and interviews consisting of a combination of closed - and open -
ended questions.   
Activity 1:  This part of the study will examine a merged data set that will include EHR data, 
Medicaid claims data, and HH -specific data. The study will rely upon a distributed query of the 
participating healthcare systems in the NYC -CDRN  and HEAL at NYU School of Medicine will 
[ADDRESS_1182470] the  NY State Medicaid data . Our data flow is depi[INVESTIGATOR_850568].  
The protocol relies upon the NYC -CDRN infrastructure established under the BRANY IRB -
approved protocol #14 -02-95-380 (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_850567]) to accomplish the data aggregation.   
1. The NYC -CDRN ([LOCATION_001] City Clinical Data Research Network) 
conducts a query on centralize d, de -identified electronic health record (EHR) data to 
select patients with diabetes.   
2. A Weill Cornell approved vendor (NYC -CDRN Central Repository ) identifies the patients 
selected in step 1 who were insured by [CONTACT_850590] 
(2007 -2017) and provides a list of the relevant CDRN Master IDs and site -specific proxy 
IDs back to the NYC -CDRN.  
3. The NYC -CDRN assigns site - and study -specific IDs (SS -IDs) to each patient. The SS -ID is 
unique to this study. The NYC -CDRN provides a li st to:  
4. 4a. The NYC -CDRN central data repository, which holds data from each of the NYC -CDRN 
clinical sites.  
4b. Health Evaluation and Analytics Lab (HEAL) - NYU School of Medicine  
4c. To Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISSMS) (in the form of a maps et, 
containing all linked SS -IDs).  
5. HEAL  utilizes SS -IDs to obtain the relevant Medicaid IDs.  
6. HEAL  provides Medicaid IDs to NYS Medicaid.  
7. NYS Medicaid pulls HH data for the relevant Medicaid IDs.  
8. NYS Medicaid sends HEAL  HH data by [CONTACT_850591].  
9. NYU HEAL  crea tes a limited data set (containing 5 -digit zip code and actual dates) 
including Medicaid claims data an d HH data by [CONTACT_195120] -IDs. 
10. HEAL  sends l imited data set to Mount Sinai.  
11. The NYC -CDRN central data repository, which holds data from e ach NYC -CDRN clinical 
site, uses the SS -IDs provided to them in step 4a to perform a  query of EHR data and 
create s a limited data set (containing 5 -digit zip code and actual dates).  
12. The NYC -CDRN central data repository, which holds data from e ach NYC -CDRN clinical 
site, provide s limited data set with SS -IDs to ISMMS.  
13. ISMSS merges Medicaid and HH data with EHR limited data sets using the map set of SS -
IDs.  
This merged data set will then be used of analyses.  
We will perform this process twice: once in 2017 for data 2007 -2014 and once  in 2019, for data 
2010-2017.  
We will perform this process twice: once in 2017 for data 2007 -2014 and once in 2019, 
for data 201 0-2017.  
Activity 2: Interviews  will be conducted with 20-[ADDRESS_1182471] the interview, 
take notes, and facilitate recording . The interview  guide was developed with the input of 
our study’s investigators a nd Patient/Stakeholder Advisory Board (PSAB).  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_234277] : the experiences of HH members/clients/patients in NYC  during the 
COVID -19 pandemic , particularly with regards to a ccessing care (for COVID -19 and non-
COVID conditions)  and a ccessing  social services . 
14 
 Based on experiences with initial  interviews , we will iteratively modify the guide based 
on discussion flow and content.  
No linkage with or examination of the participant’s medical record will occur. Transcripts 
will be stripped of ident ifying information and not linked in any way to PHI. 
Activity 3:  One-on-one interviews will be conducted with leaders from NYC HHs  and care 
managers .  No other procedures will be performed with participants. The interviews will 
cover topi[INVESTIGATOR_20733]: HH a nd Care Management Agency (CMA) struc ture, activities, 
reporting, quality measurement, quality improvement, challenges, areas of excellence, 
referral and enrollment processes, characteristics of the population served , and the 
experiences of [LOCATION_001]ers wor king with the Health Home (care managers, program 
leaders) during the COVID -19 pandemic .  The interview guide was developed in 
collaboration with our study’s Patient/Stakeholder Advisory Board (PSAB).  These 
interviews are low -risk: they do not touch on pri vate or confidential information . 
 
Activity 4:  We plan to use NYS Medicaid administrative and claims data in the Medicaid Data 
Warehouse, available to researchers at HEAL at [LOCATION_001] University.  This is the same data set described 
in Activity 1.  
 
 
g) Specime n Banking  
Not applicable.  
 
h) Data Management and Confidentiality  
Activity 1:  The NYC -CDRN has  developed standardized protocols to transfer data  securely 
between sites (including ISMMS), RHIOs, a Weill Cornell approved vendor (NYC -CDRN Central 
Repository) , Project Ops of the NYC -CDRN. All data flows between parties will use established, 
secure methods of transmission.  These currently include secure FTP and public key encryption 
protocol (for data transmission from sites to  a Weill Cornell approved vendor ); secure FTP (for 
data transmission from sites to the RHIOs); secure sockets layer (for data transmission from 
Healthix to a Weill Cornell approved vendor ).  The data flow was created to minimize any privacy 
and confidentiality risks through the use of Member IDs (proxy IDs) and of Site - and Study -
Specific IDs (SS -IDs).   
[CONTACT_32137] and her team  have signed  a contract committing them to comply with NYC -CDRN 
privacy and security policies and abide by [CONTACT_850592].  
[CONTACT_32137] will upload all  data received to a secured, password -protected, fire -walled local hard 
drive. Only [CONTACT_32137] and other authorized members of the analysis team will be able to access 
these files for the purpose of conducting analyses.  All  authorized members of the team will have 
completed any required CITI courses in biomedical research.  After all analyses are complete, the 
files will be removed from the hard drive and deleted permanently.   
Activity 2: Focus groups , telephone focus group s, and individual interviews  will be audio 
recorded. Audio recordings will be securely shared with a HIPAA compliant transcription 
and translation company. Focus group  and interview  transcripts will be stripped of 
identifiers prior to storage on password -prote cted, hard -drives.  Participant  contact 
[CONTACT_850593] 
15 
 (no study ID or other link will be used).  Contact [CONTACT_850594] -protected hard drives. Only authorized study staff who have completed 
research ethics training will have access to any data. Data will be stored for an additional 
year after all analyses have been completed.  
Activity 3:  Contact [CONTACT_850595] . All contact [CONTACT_850596] -
protected hard drives.   Interview s will be audio recorded and transcribed and  transcripts 
will be stripped of identifiers prior to storage on password -protected, hard -drives.  
Participant contact [CONTACT_850597] (no study ID or other link will be used).  Only authorized study staff 
who have completed research ethics training will hav e access to any data. Data will be 
stored for an additional year after all analyses have been completed.  
 
i) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
This research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects.  The PI, [CONTACT_32137], will 
oversee data monitoring, focusing on the protection of the confidentiality of participant 
data.  The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_850604], and the primary study team are 
located at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). The study will ut ilize the 
IRB of the Biomedical Research Alliance of [LOCATION_001] (BRANY) and the Columbia 
University IRB (the only member of the [LOCATION_001] City Clinical Data Research Network 
(NYC -CDRN) that does not rely on BRANY).  
 
The PI, [CONTACT_32137], will monitor the resear ch study in close collaboration with and in 
concert with the regulations of the staff of the NYC -CDRN, NYS Medicaid’s Data 
Warehouse Office of Health Insurance Programs Privacy Office, BRANY, the Columbia 
University IRB, and the ISMMS.  
 
This study will ut ilize multiple data sources, including 1) data from the NYC -CDRN and 
data from [LOCATION_001] State Medicaid (both retrospective), 2) focus groups  and interviews , 
and 3) one -on-one interviews with Health Home leaders. All [ADDRESS_1182472] practices for data security. 
All data at ISMMS will be stored and accessed according to established regulations of 
ISMMS to ensure data privacy and security. Limited data sets will be con structed to 
contain the minimal amount of PHI needed to complete the study.  
16 
  
While we do not anticipate adverse events associated with our focus groups or 
interviews, in the case of an adverse event the study team would report this to BRANY for 
review. In  the case of unanticipated problems, the study team will report this to BRANY a 
for review.  
 
 
j) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Activity 1  and 4 : Researchers will not be able to identify subjects. Identifying subjects in 
order to withdraw them from the study would c ompromise confidentiality.   
Activity 2:  Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_242527] 
[INVESTIGATOR_850569] .  If subjects choose to withdraw from the study, we will not 
collect any further data, but will utilize already colle cted data as part of the focus group  
or individual interview . 
Activity 3:  Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_242527] 
[INVESTIGATOR_850570].  If subjects choose to withdraw from the study, we will not 
collect any further  data, but will utilize already collected data.  
 
  
6) Risks to Subjects  
Activity 1  and 4 : The principal potential risks to subjects are confidentiality risks.  We 
believe the risk is minimal because researchers, partner sites , and  the a Weill Cornell 
approved vendor (NYC -CDRN Central Repository ) must follow rigorous, established NYC-
CDRN policies and proced ures for privacy and security. NYC -CDRN p roject staff are 
trained in privacy and security, data transfer protocols are in place and data will be held 
on serv ers approved for holding PHI. The limited  data sets that contain retrospective EHR 
data  and Medicaid data , which will be given  by [CONTACT_850598] -CDRN partner sites  to 
investigators  at Mount Sinai will  meet all applicable federal regulations and there is 
minimal risk to patient confidentiality.  The merged limited data sets will be stored on 
servers approved for holding PHI. Only study staff trained in data privacy, security, and 
research ethics will be able to access this data.  
Activity 2 : The principal po tential risks to subjects are non -physical privacy and 
confidentiality risks.  As far as confidentiality, transcripts will be stripped of all identifying 
information  during the transcri ption process. We will use a HI PAA compliant transcription  
service.  Thu s, transcripts used for analysis will not contain identifiable data. Any sharing 
of results will also not contain any identifiable information. In addition, participants may 
find it uncomfortable to answer certain questions that come up during the intervie ws. 
Moderators will make it clear that participants can stop sharing at any time, and that they 
do not need to answer any questions that make them feel uncomfortable - it is their 
choice.   
Activity 3:  There is a minimal confidentiality risk associated with the HH leader and care 
manager interviews. It is unlikely that any information shared in these interviews will be 
confidential; however, participants may share sensitive opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]/criticisms. When 
reporting results, we will therefore remove identifying info rmation by [CONTACT_850599].  
17 
  
7) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
This research involves  no more than minimal risk to subjects.   
 
8) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Activity 1  and 4 : There will be no direct benefit to subjects w hose data is a part of this 
study. The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the impact of the Health Home 
intervention on patients with diabetes. Identifying care management programs that are 
effective can offer benefit to the population of patients wi th diabetes and complex 
medical problems.  
Activity 2:  There will be no direct benefit to focus group or individual interview 
participants. As above, the overall study aims to benefit patients with diabetes.  
Activity 3 : There will be no direct benefit to HH  leaders or care managers who participate 
in interviews. However, as key stakeholders in the HH program, they may benefit from 
knowledge eventually produced by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Activity 1  and 4 : This aspec t of the research involves retrospective data analysis, with no 
contact [CONTACT_20688].  
Activity 2:   Interview  recruitment: HH care managers will share the names and contact 
[CONTACT_850600]/clients/patients with the recruitment team, or 
interested participants can reach out directly to team staff. The recruitment team will be 
trained in responsible research practices and will not reveal any private information via 
voicemail or message.  No private information will be elicited by [CONTACT_648].   
Interviews : We will let participants know that they may decline to answer any questions 
or refrain from participating in any discussions that are not comfortable or which raise 
privacy concerns for them.  Any sharing of results will also not contain any identifiable 
information.   
Follow up:  As part of the study, we have proposed sharing overall study findings with 
participants from focus groups  and interviews . Thus, we have included in the consent 
form that we would like to contact [CONTACT_850601] f uture regarding study findings.  In 
addition, we will utilize address information to send gift cards to participants. Again, all 
outreach staff will not disclose private information as part of outreach efforts.  
Activity 3: Information on the names and cont act information of HH leaders is publicly 
available, and we will not be risking privacy by [CONTACT_850602].  Care manager 
information will not be linked with responses.  We will make it clear to those who choose 
to participate that data on thei r personal opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]/criticisms will not be linked with their 
identity/specific -HH.  
 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects  
Activity 1: no costs to subjects.  
Activity 2: no costs to subjects.  
Activity 3: no costs to subjects.  
Activity 4: no costs to subjects.  
 
 
18 11)Paym ents to Subjects
Activity 1  and 4 : There will be n o payments to subjects.  
Activity 2:  We will provide a $[ADDRESS_1182473] s in 
the mail.   
Activity 3:  We will provide a $ [ADDRESS_1182474] to each participant in appreciation of their 
time.  
12)Consent Process
Activity 1  and 4 : For this analysis, we request a HIPAA waiver.  
Activity 2:  Prior to participation in an individual phone inte rview ,  study staff will read a 
script describing the research study, the risks and benefits of participating, and requesting 
verbal consent.  Participants will be provided with written information describing the 
research.  We are seeking a waiver of written  consent in this case . The only purpose of an 
in-person interaction would be to obtain written consent.  This aspect of the research 
presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects, and this research involves no 
procedures for which written consent i s normally required outside of the research 
context.  
Activity 3: We request a waiver of written documentation of the consent process. This 
aspect of the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects, and this 
research involves no procedur es for which written consent is normally required outside of 
the research context. Study staff will read a script describing the research study, the risks 
and benefits of participating, and requesting verbal consent by [CONTACT_648].  Participants will be 
provided with written information describing the research.  
13)Process to Document Consent in Writing
Activity 1  and 4 : For this analysis, we request a HIPAA waiver.  
Activity 2:  Any individuals who participate in individual phone interviews will provide 
verbal consen t before the interview begins.  
Activity 3: We request a waiver of written documentation of the consent process. This 
aspect of the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects, and this 
research involves no procedures for which written c onsent is normally required outside of 
the research context.  
14)Vulnerable Populations
Activity 1  and 4 : This retrospective data analysis will not specifically target vulnerable 
populations; however, vulnerable individuals may be a part of the cohort. For t his arm of the 
research, we will not be asking participants to engage in research -related risk, and will have 
measures in place to protect the confidentiality of all individuals who are included in the 
research.  
Activity 2:  For t he interviews , we will not  recruit individuals from vulnerable populations. All 
participants will need to be able to give consent and be adults.  
19 Activity 3: The HH -leader  and care manager  interviews will be carried out with individuals in 
leadership positions, and we will not recr uit individuals from specific vulnerable populations. 
15)Multi -Site Human Research (Coordinating Center)
This is a multi -site study with ISMMS  as the lead entity. All data will be stored at ISMMS. 
Investigators from other institutions will have access only to data from analyses, but not 
to individual level data. They will participate in developi[INVESTIGATOR_850571].   
16)Sharing of Results with Subjects
Results of all activities will be shared in aggregate through academic presentations and 
publications, lay talks, lay press communications. Results of overall study will be 
disseminated among focus group and interview participants.

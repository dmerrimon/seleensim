Official Title : A Mindfulness and Peer Mentoring Program to Improve Adherence to 
Medication  Assisted Treatment for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_439022]: July 19, 2021
MiMP R61 ANALYTIC PLAN  
AIM 1 [R61] : To establish the feasibility and acceptability of the Minds and Mentors Program (MiMP) for 
individuals  on medications for OUD ( MOUD; n = 20).  
Objective 1:  Successfully train counselors and pee r mentors, recruit and  randomize [ADDRESS_556345] two years.   
Hypothesis 1 : Successfully train two counselors and two peer facilitators; the MiMP  will demonstrate enrollment, 
randomization, and retention rates ≥ 50%; and ≥ 50% of participants will positive ly endorse MiMP as acceptable.  
 
Objective 2:  Prior to the R33 comparing between -group differences in adherence (primary outcome), we will 
examin e pre - to post -intervention (within -subject) changes in self -reported craving , relapse,  stress, anxiety, 
depression, and social support (secondary outcomes) to determine whether there is preliminary evidence that 
these outcomes can be improved in those rec eiving the MiMP.  
Hypothesis 2:  The MiMP will produce reductions in one or more of the following: self -reported stress, cravings, 
depression, or anxiety, or improvement s in perceived social support.  
 
 
The primary outcome variable is adherence to MOUD , quan tified as the number of days MOUD  was received 
as indicated during the last [ADDRESS_556346] that this can be treated as a continuous 
variable in regression models. However, prior to modeling we will examine its distribution, to determine if this is 
appro priate. If, for example, we observe large ceiling effects (many participants report very high or perfect 
adherence) then we may model non -adherenc e as the number of days when MOUD  was not received. In this 
case we expect it would have something similar to a Poisson distribution, possibly with over -dispersion which 
would suggest the use of negative binomial regression.  The secondary outcome of relapse  will be treated in 
two ways, as a binary indicator if any relapse during the last [ADDRESS_556347] intervention using repeated measures analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA), including covariates, as necessary. Study outcomes will be also be examined using longitudinal 
regression models, including covariates, as necessary. The full model will include fixed within -subject effects to 
predict outcomes (stress, depression, anxiety, cravings, self -efficacy, baseline cortisol, cortisol re activity) .

reactivity) to examine the effects of treatment on baseline (resting) cortisol levels and cortisol reactivity. Cortisol 
data is often skewed ,100 so transformations may be performed. The cortisol res ponse will be quantified  by

, where ti is the interval between sample i and sample i+1 and mi is the level of cortisol for 
sample i. In addition, the influence of pre -treatment cortisol (resting and reactivity) on responsiveness to 
treatment (as measured by [CONTACT_439025]) will be examined.

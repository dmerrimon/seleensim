3. STUDY PROTOCOL This was a multi-center, double-masked (participants and research team), randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 study conducted between January 2020 and June 2020 at 4 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (Total Eye Care, Andover Eye Associates, Eye Research Foundation and Midwest Cornea Associates, LLC). This study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for good clinical practice (GCP). Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee approval was obtained. All potential subjects provided written informed consent before screening.  After the screening visit, eligible subjects entered a one-week run-in period to receive preservative-free placebo solution bilaterally three times daily (TID) to minimize the placebo effect.  Subjects that exhibited improvements in symptoms of dry eye syndrome (DES) at the end of the run-in period, relative to screening values, were disqualified. Eligible subjects were subsequently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or BRM421 Ophthalmic Solution three times daily (TID) in each eye for total [ADDRESS_1139547] (LOCF) imputation method of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population at week [ADDRESS_1139548] in each group was calculated by [CONTACT_105225]-controlled adverse environment (CAE) mode.  The difference from baseline in pre-CAE values for active treatment was tested versus placebo using a two-way ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline at α = 0.05. A Wilcoxon rank sum test and a two-sample t-test were also assessed where appropriate.  
The continuous and ordinal secondary efficacy variables were analyzed with an ANCOVA model adjusting for baseline and also evaluated with a two-sample t-test comparing active treatment to placebo.  No imputation was performed for secondary efficacy variables.

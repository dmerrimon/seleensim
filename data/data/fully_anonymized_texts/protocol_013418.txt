Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open- label, study.  The study will Need to update : 
 
Cohort 1 ( Single -Agent Dose -Finding) :  Dose -escalation to find the RD of lenvatinib using 
a Time to Event continual reassessment ( TiTE -CRM) design in children and adolescents with 
relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumors (see Study Treatment  below for dose-
escalation scheme)  (Doussau, et al., 2012).  When  the RD is identified, Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 
Cohort 3A will start in parallel.  Af ter the RD is determined in Cohort 1, subsequent 
osteosarcoma subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 2B (Single -Agent Expansion) or 
Cohort 3A ( Combination Dose-Finding), depending on whether the subject is deemed by [CONTACT_149630] a candidate f or ifosfamide and etoposide . (If not, the subject would only be 
assigned to Cohort 2B).

 Cohort 2 ( Single -Agent Expansion) :  To test  the efficacy of lenvatinib in children and 
adolescents with 131I-refractory DTC  (Cohort 2A) , or subjects with relapsed or refractory 
osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B) .  Cohort 2A and Cohort 2B will be open for enroll ment  in parallel 
with Cohort 3A ( Combination Dose -Finding).  
Cohort 3  
Cohort 3A (Combination Dose -Finding) : To define the RD of lenvatinib in combination 
with ifosfamide a nd etoposide in subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.  This 
cohort will be open for enrollment in parall el with Cohort 2 ( Single -Agent E xpansion).   
After defining the RD of lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy in Cohort 3A, 
subsequent osteosarcoma subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 2B (Single -Agent 
Expansion) or Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion), depending on whether  the subject is 
deemed by [CONTACT_2418] a candidate for ifosfamide and etoposide  ( If not, the subject 
would only be assigned to Cohort 2B ).  
Cohort 3B  (Combination Expansion ):  To test the efficacy of lenvatinib in combination 
with ifosfamide  and etoposide in subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.  
Subjects with osteosarcoma who have enrolle d into Cohort 1 or 2B and experience d 
progressive disease on lenvati nib as well as lenvatinib -naïve subjects with relapsed or 
refractory osteosarcoma will be candidates for enrollment in Cohort 3B. 
The study will include 3 phases:  Pretreatment (screening) , Treatment  (includes a Run- In 
Period for Cohort 1) , and Post treatment F ollow -up. 
Pretreatment Phase:  Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility.  
Treatment Phase:   
In all cohorts, lenvatinib will be administered orally once daily  (QD).   One treatment cycle is 
defined as a 28 -day period  for Cohorts 1, 2A , and 2B and a 21-day period for Cohorts 3A and 
3B.  A new treatment cycle is started after every 28 day period  for Single -Agent Cohorts 1, 
2A, and 2B or after a 21 -day period for C ombination- Treatment Cohorts 3A and 3B , 
irrespective of dose interruptions.   
Cohort 1 ( Single-Agent Dose -Finding) :     
Dose -Escalation  in Cohort 1 Cycle 1:  
Subjects 6 to <18 years will enroll in Cohort 1 prior to subjects 2 to <6 years of age. The 
lenvatinib starting dose is 11 mg/m2 QD (approximately 80% of the adult RD of 24 mg QD).  
If the 11 mg/m2 dose is not safe and tolerable, the dose will be de -escalated to 9 mg/m2 (Dose 
Level - 1).  Doses of study drug administered during Cohort 1 of the study are displayed in 
the figure  above .  Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur during Cycle [ADDRESS_1045431] dose -escalation and to determine the

in a table below.  The RD in this study will be defined as the dose that has a DLT rate closest 
to the targeted 20% rate.  The TiTE-CRM design allows continuous accrual throughout the 
study while using the [ADDRESS_1045433] 2 
subjects should receive the full 4- week study treatment or report a DLT (at the starting dose)  
and complete evaluations before escalation to the next dose level.  No intra-subject dose escalation will be allowed.  Subjects who discontinue the study before the end of Cycle  1 
(Cycle 1 D ay 1 – C ycle 1 D ay 28) due to reasons other than DLT will be replaced.  Refer to 
the figure above for the study design.

 DLT data in Cycle 1 will be included in all subsequent TiTE -CRM calculations . 
Cohort 2 (Single-Agent Expansion):   
The efficacy of lenvatinib in children and adolescents,and young adults with osteosarcoma 
will be evaluated in 2 malignancy groups separately:  DTC (Cohort 2A) and osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B).  Subjects will be treated at the RD identified in Cohort 1.  The primary efficacy endpoint in the DTC group is ORR (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) for subjects with measurable disease and BOR for all subjects based on RECIST 1.1.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint in the osteosarcoma group is PFS, assessed at [ADDRESS_1045441] 1.1. 
Cohort 3A (Combination Dose -Finding) :   
Lenvatinib will be administered orally QD in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide from Day  1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of 5 cycles to osteosarcoma subjects as 
described  below  and in Table 2.  Refer to Section 9.4.3 for dosing details.

Six subjects with osteosarcoma (who have not received prior lenvatinib) will be enrolled first to Cohort 3A at the s tarting dose of lenvatinib (20% below the Single-Agent RD in Cohort 1) 
in combination with ifosfamide 3000 mg/m
2/day for 3 days (ifosfamide total dose 9 g/m2) 
and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day for 3 days (etoposide total dose 300 mg/m2).  Subjects with  
lenvatinib dose capped after  BSA adjustment ( dose must not exceed 24 mg daily) actually 
take lower dose level than assigned.  If a subject with capp ed dose experiences a DLT, the 
DLT data from that subject will be counted to determine the RD of the combination treatment.  A subject with capped  dose who does not experience a DLT will be replaced for 
the purpose of determining the RD.

 DLTs occurring dur ing Cycle 1 will be evaluated , and the next 6 subjects will be assigned a 
dose based on the rul es for Dose Escalation and De -Escalation as follows:  
a. If ≤1 out of 6 subjects experiences  a DLT at the s tarting dose during Cycle 1 (Day  1 to 
Day 21), then assign 6 more subjects to the next higher dose level of lenvatinib (RD 
from Cohort 1) and keep the chemotherapy dose the same ( starting dose).  
b. If ≥2 out of 6 subjects experience a DLT at the starting dose during Cycle 1 (Day 1 to 
Day 21), then follow  the instructions below ; 
i. If ≥2 subjects experience hematologic DLT and ≤ [ADDRESS_1045444] experiences non -
hematologic  DLT , then assign 6 more subjects to 20% lower doses ( De-
escalation 1 ) of ifosfamide and etoposide  and keep the lenvatinib dose the same; 
or 
ii. If ≥2 subje cts experience nonhematologic DLT s and ≤ [ADDRESS_1045445] experiences a

(De-escalation 1)  and keep the ifosfamide and etoposide  doses the same; or  
iii. If ≥2 subjects experience hematologic DLTs and ≥2 subjects experience 
nonhematologic DLTs, then assign 6 more subjects to 20% lower doses of 
lenvatinib, ifosfamide , and etoposide  each ( De-escalation 1 ); or 
iv. If only [ADDRESS_1045446] experiences 
a nonhema tologic DLT, then assign 6 more subjects to the same dose level of  
lenvatinib, ifosfamide , and etoposide  each.  
c. Continue the above processes until the combination dose of lenvatinib, ifosfamide , and

considered (pending discussion with the Protocol Steering Committee [PSC]), if needed.   
Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion) :   
Subjects with either lenvatinib -naïve relapsed osteosarcoma or osteosarcoma subjects who 
progress on single -agent lenvatinib in Cohort s 1 or  2B (optional enrollment) will receive the 
combination RD from Cohort 3A , provided the combination of lenvatinib, if osfamide , and

combination therapy of lenvatinib with ifosfamide and etoposide, prior to entering Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion), baseline tumor assessments by [CONTACT_20420]/magnetic resonance imaging ( CT/MRI ) must be repeated  on new images , unless the images  confirming 
disease progression were  performed within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 in Cohort 3B.  Subjects 
will undergo assessment s as per the S chedule of Assessments provided for the combination 
treatment.  
Subjects in Cohorts 3A and 3B will receive ifosfamide and etoposide for a maximum of 5 cycles . Subjects who discontinue ifosfamide and etoposide ( eg, due to toxicity) prior to 
completing 5 cycles may continue on single- agent lenvatinib if they are benefiting from the 
treatment at the  discretion of the investigator.  Subjects who discontinue lenvatinib prior to 
completing 5 cycles may continue on ifosfamide and etoposide, at  the investigator’s 
discretion , for [ADDRESS_1045449].  
Dose -Limiting Toxicity   
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  in subjects treated with lenvatinib will be assessed according 
to Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.03 ( Appendix 2) and is 
defined as any of the following toxicities related to lenvatinib or chemotherapy drugs (ifosfamide and/or etoposide) occurring during Cycle 1 (D ay 1 to Day 28) for Cohort 1 and

FINAL:  [ADDRESS_1045473] of treatment with drugs inhibiting vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling.  Investigators should therefore ensure that 
subjects enrolled to receive treatment with lenvatinib have BP <95th  percentile [ BP ≤ 150/90 
mm Hg ] for sex, age, and height/length at the time of study entry and, if known to be 
hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week 
before Cycle 1 Day  1.  Early detection and effective management of hypertension are 
importa nt to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interruptions and reductions.  
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥ 95th 
percentile or diastolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [ BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg ]) is 
confirmed on [ADDRESS_1045474]’s clinical circums tances 
and follow standard medical practice.  For previously normotensive subjects, monotherapy 
with one of the classes of antihypertensives shoul d be started when systolic BP ≥ 95th 
percentile [ BP ≥140 mm Hg ] or diastolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [ BP ≥90 mm Hg ] is first 
observed on 2 assessments obtained 1 hour apart.  For those subjects already on 
antihypertensive medication, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, 
or 1 or more agents of a different class of antihypertensive should be added.  For subjects 
with hypertension and proteinuria, treatment with an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor or angiotensin- II receptor antagonist is preferred.  
 
Lenvatinib  should be withheld in any instances where a subject is at imminent risk t o 
develop a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complications of 
uncontrolled hypertension (eg, BP ≥99th percentile  [BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg ], significant 
risk factors for cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant 
comorbidities).  Once the subject has been on the same anti hypertensive medications 
for at least 48 hours and the BP is controlled, lenvatinib should be resumed as 
described below.  
During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥ 99th percentile  [BP ≥ 160 mm Hg]  
or diastolic BP ≥ 99th percentile [ BP ≥ 100 mm Hg] must have their BP monitored every 2 
weeks (on Day 15 or more frequently as clinically indicate d) until systolic BP has been < 95th 
percent ile [≤150 mm Hg ] and diastolic BP has been < 95th percentile [ ≤ 95 mm Hg ] for 3 
consecutive months.  If a new event of systolic BP ≥ 99th percent ile [BP ≥ 160 mm Hg]  or 
diastolic BP ≥ 99th percentile [ BP ≥ 100 mm Hg ] occu rs, the subject must resume the Day 15 
evaluati on until systolic BP has been < 95th percent ile [≤150 mm Hg]  and diastolic BP has 
been <95th percentile [ ≤ 95 mm Hg] for 3 consecutive months.  
The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥ 99th 
percentile [ BP ≥ 160 mm Hg]  or diastolic BP ≥ 99th percentile  [BP ≥ 100 mm Hg]  confirmed 
on repeat measurements after an hour:

• Initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] o f proteinuria: If proteinuria ≥ 2+ is detected on urine dipstick testing, 
study drug will be continued and a spot protein- creatinine ratio test and if possible  a 
24-hour urine collection for total protein will be obtained as soon as possible within 72 hours to verify the grade of proteinuria.  Gradin g according to CTCAE v4.03 
(Appendix 2) will be based on the protein- creatinine  ratio , and when ever possible, 
also on the 24-hour urinary protein result per investigators discretion .  Management 
of lenvatinib administration will b e based on the grade of proteinuria according to the 
Treatment Related Toxicity table.  
• During the Treatment Period, urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥ 2+ 
should be performed every 2 weeks (on Day 15 or more frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months.  Any subsequent increase s in the level of proteinuria ≥ 2+ on urine dipstick testing must be 
confirmed with a spot protein- creatinine  ratio test , and if possible a 24-hour urinary 
protein test as per investigators discretion , which will be assessed and graded  and 
managed  according to the dose reduction and interruption instructions provided in the 
table above.   If a new event of proteinuria ≥ 2+ occurs, the subject must resume the 
Day 15 urine dipstick testing for evaluation of proteinuria until results are 1+ or 
negative for 3 consecutive months.  
Management of Hepatotoxicity 
Regular monitoring of liver function tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate 
transaminase [AST], bilirubin levels) should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments and as clinically indicated.  If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury o ccur, 
instructions contained in the table for dose reduction and interruptions of the protocol should be followed, “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions.”  Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If hepatic failure occurs , 
the study drug must be discontinued. 
Management of Thromboembolic Events 
Subjects should be advised to pay attention to symptoms suggestive of venous 
thromboembolic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) signs 
including lower- extremity swelling, redness, and warmth to touch or tenderness.  In case any 
of these symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the treating physician.  If a thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructions contained in the table for dose reduction and interruptions of the protocol should be followed, “Study Treatment Dose Reduction and Interruption instructions.”  Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If a subject experiences life- threatening

Management of Ifosfamide-Etoposide Associated Toxicity 
All sites participating in this trial have had considerable experience with these 
chemotherapeutic agents.   Blood counts should be closely monitored during and prior to the 
next cycle of chemotherapy.   Chemotherapy -associated myelosuppression should be 
managed by G -CSF.   It is recommended that pegy lated G- CSF or G -CSF be administered at 
least 24 to  72 hours after completion of i fosfamide -etoposide chemotherapy ; use of G- CSF is 
recommended until WBC counts are ≥1 × 10
9/L.  Guidelines for dose modification for 
ifosfamide - and etoposide -associated toxi cities are provided below.  
• Neutropenia (Grade 4): Monitor ANC counts every 3 days until resolved to <Grade 3  
• Febrile neutropenia (Grade 4): Reduce the next dose of ifosfamide and etoposide by 20% each  
• Mucositis (repeated Grade 3 or Grade 4): Reduce etopos ide by 20% 
• Renal Toxicity: If serum creatinine >1.5 - 3 × ULN - interrupt ifosfamide and 
etoposide for 1 week  
• Hematuria: Interrupt ifosfamide and etoposide if hematuria >50 RBC/ high power

Duration of Treatment 
Subjects benefiting from study treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_763021], intolerable toxicity, subject noncompliance with safety or efficacy assessments, initiation of another anticancer therapy, volu ntary 
discontinuation by [CONTACT_649906], or study termination by [CONTACT_97280], whichever 
occurs first.   
Concomitant Drug/Therapy  
Prophylac tic use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor s (G-CSFs) is not permitted during 
this study  in Cohorts 1, 2A , and 2B. G-CSF use is recommended for Cohorts 3A and 3B to 
mitigate the toxicity of ifosfamide and etoposide).  
The following concomitant treatments/procedures are allowed: 
a. Removal of existing (not new) osteosarcoma metastatic lesion (surgical, radiofreq uency ablation, etc) is allowed  only: 
• After completion of the first 4 months of the T reatment Period without 
progression, and 
• Before the first [ADDRESS_1045478] will discontinue the study for progression  
b. Palliative radiotherapy in Cohorts 2 and 3B is allowed for ≤ [ADDRESS_1045479] receiving treatment with lenvatinib requires surgery during the study, the stop time and restart time of lenvatinib should be as follows: 
• For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least [ADDRESS_1045480] 2 days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and 
no risk of bleeding.

Eisai  
FINAL:  22 Nov 2019  Confidential  Page 26 of 165  
 • For major procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to 
surgery and then restart it at least [ADDRESS_1045481] 1.1 ( Appendix 1) .  Investigator-
determined response assessments at each assessment time point will be entered onto the appropriate case report form (CRF).  
At Screening  
CT scans of the brain, neck (DTC only) chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease (bone metastases)  plus any areas of newly suspected disease, will be performed at the 
Screening  Visit.  MRI may be used for brain, neck, abdomen, pelvis, and other sites of 
disease, but chest may  only be evaluated with CT. 
During Treatment Phase 
For Cohort [ADDRESS_1045482]/MRI scans of neck (DTC only), chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other 
known sites of disease plus any areas of newly suspected disease will be performed using the same methodology as at screening every [ADDRESS_1045483] treatment dose, 
continuing during treatment cycles until documentation of disease progression.  
For subjects with DTC (Cohort 2A) CT/MRI of the neck and other known sites of the disease 
plus any areas of newly suspected disease and CT c hest will be performed.   For osteosarcoma 
(Cohorts 2B, 3A and 3B), CT chest, and CT/MRI of other known sites of dise ase plus any 
areas of newly suspected disease will be performed.  Tumor assessments should be performed using the same methodology as at screening every [ADDRESS_1045484]/MRI of the brain must be 
performed at all tumor assessment time points.  An initial assessment of CR or PR according to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1045485] be confirmed not less than 4 weeks after the initial response.  In subjects 
2 to <[ADDRESS_1045486]/MRI scans must be performed at s creening, Cycle 1 Day 1

documented disease progression up to [ADDRESS_1045489] unless the study is terminated.  After data cutoff, tumor as sessments may be performed as clinically indicated using the 
investigator’s discretion, following the prevailing local standard of care.   
Palatability and Acceptability of Lenvatinib Suspension Formulation 
The palatability and acceptability of lenvatinib suspension formulation will be assessed using 
the Palatability Questionnaire (see Appendix 13).  All subjects who receive suspension 
formulation mu st complete the questionnaire according to  the Schedule of A ssessments.   If 
the subject is unable to complete the questionnaire, this must be done by a parent or legal guardian.  Measurement of palatability will be assessed using the Hedonic scale (Guinard, 2001)  which is a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for PK profiling of lenvatinib will be collected on Day 1 and Day 15 (single agent cohorts only- see Table 5)  of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycle 2.  For Cohort 1, Run- In 
Period blood samples will be collected on Day 15 (predose).  PK blood samples for lenvatinib will also be drawn pretreatment on the day of tumor assessment.  Exposure parameters such as area under the concentration × time curve (AUC) will be derived  from 
posterior estimates of the PK parameters from the final population PK model.  
Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood serum samples from study subjects will be collected at Baseline, Day 8 of Cycle 1 
(Combination- Agent cohorts) , Day 15 of Cycle 1 (Single -Agent cohorts), Day 1 of all 
subsequent cycles, and at the Off -treatment Visit.  For subjects ongoing after the data cutoff 
date for the primary analysis, blood sample s will be collected at the Off -Treatment Visit.  For 
subjects 2 to <6 years, a blood serum sample will be collected in Cohort 1 at Day 1 of C ycle 
1 (predose).  Blood serum samples may be analyzed using global proteomic methods, enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex bead-based immunoassay, or other 
assays/methods and new technology in an effort to identify biomarkers.  In addition, 
biomarkers identified in other lenvatinib clinical studies may also be assessed in samples collected from subjects enrolled in this study.  Blood biomarker samples may be used for exploratory analysis for evaluation of response- related  outcomes as well as for potential use 
in diagnostic development.

 Archived, fixed tumor tissue will be collected (if available) for assessment of mutations and 
other genetic alterations or proteins that may be important in the development and 
progression of cancer as well as for potential use in diagnostic development. 
A blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis.  The DNA may be analyzed for genes associ ated with lenvatinib absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) 
and to validate mutations suspected of functional relevance (using in silico prediction) to determine exclusivity to tumor sample.  The DNA will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not currently have. 
Data obtained from the PD and PG samples will be used for research.  The PD and PG 
samples will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA, RNA, and protein) may be stored for up to [ADDRESS_1045490] reaches the age of 18 years (or 16 years in the [LOCATION_006]) while on the study, and 
becomes competent to give informed consent, his/her consent will be obtained using separate ICFs to continue on the study. 
Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs); regular laboratory evaluation for hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs ; 12-lead ECGs ; Lans ky play 
score or 
Karnofsky performance status  score;  physical examinations ; and height assessments.   
A diary will be provided to each subject to capture any abnormal gastrointestinal symptoms 
(e.g., diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, cramps, etc) experienced during the study.  Fecal occult blood will be monitored regularly during the study. 
Skeletal bone growth will be assessed by [CONTACT_763063], 
thereafter Day 1 of each cycle during the Treatment Phase for Cohort 1 (and Day 1 of eve ry 3 
cycles for cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B); at the Off -treatment Visit, and every [ADDRESS_1045491]- treatment Follow -up.  Proximal tibial growth plates x -rays will be done at baseline  
and at the off- treatment visit.  Postbaseline,  only open growth plates will be further assessed.  
Clinical and laboratory toxicities/symptomatology will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 ( Appendix 2).  Adverse events that 
are not reported in the CTCAE will be graded on a 4-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening).

 Cohort 1 ( Single -Agent Dose -Findi ng) 
Cohort [ADDRESS_1045501] of lenvatinib  and to increase the 
flexibility by [CONTACT_763064], which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_763022], is not completed (Smith, et al., 1998; Cheung, 2009) .  Using th e TiTE- CRM design, an eligible subject can be 
included in the trial at any time, without waiting for the completion  of prior subjects 
(Doussau, et al., 2012) .  The model will be re -estimated considering all the toxicity 
observations currently available.  The subject will be treated at the best current estimate of the RD.  Individual subjects on long- term trea tment may be treated at a dose below the dose 
recommended by [CONTACT_763065].  
The RD will be defined as the dose that has a DLT rate closest to the targeted 20% rate.  
Four experimental doses may be investigated in Cohort 1:  Dose -1 (9 mg/m
2), Dose 1 
(11 mg/m2), Dose 2 (14 mg/m2), and Dose 3 (17 mg/m2).  The starting dose will be Dose 1. 
A one- parameter empi[INVESTIGATOR_763023]: ) exp() , (αα dp d F=  where F(d, α) is the estimated probability 
of DLT at dose-level d, p d is the prior probability of DLT at dose level d, and α is the 
unknown parameter to be estimated by [CONTACT_10994].  The vector {p 0d} represents the initial 
guesses of toxicity probabilities, reflecting the clinicians’ prior impression.  The skeleton of 
initial guesses of toxicity probabilities { p0d} is numerically calibrated using the approach of  
(Lee, et al., 2005; Cheung, 2009)  and using the “getprior” function of R, ensuring good 
design operating char acteristics.  Based on consultation with the clinicians, the delta (half of 
the width of the CI) defining the indifference interval was set at 0.06 (indifference interval: 0.14 to 0.26) and the prior maximum tolerated dose (MTD
0) at Dose 2, (14 mg/m²) is l ikely 
to be the RD (same as in adults).  This yields a vector of prior probabilities {p 0k} equal to 
0.03, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.33, for the doses 9 mg/m2, 11 mg/m2, 14 mg/m2, and 17 mg/m2, 
respectively, that was found reasonable by [CONTACT_47656].  
A noninformative prior distribution Normal (0, 1.34) has been assigned for α in the Bayesian 
computation.  
The simulation study confirmed that the operating characteristics of the model defined with 
these parameters were reasonable, with more than 50% correct selecti on of the RD in [ADDRESS_1045502] 2 subjects will be required to complete 4- week treatment

Sample Size Rationale 
Approximately 69 to  108 subjects are planned for this study. 
Cohort 1 ( Single -Agent Dose -Finding)  
Approximately 12 to 24 subjects based on TiTE- CRM algorithm ( Cheung and Chappell,  
2000).  
Cohort 2 (Single -Agent Expansion)  
Approximately 27 to 42 subjects:  DTC group (12 subjects) and osteosar coma group ( 15 to 
30 subjects).  
Cohort 2A:  DTC Group  
Approximately 12 subjects with evaluable or measurable disease are planned to be enrolled 
in Cohort 2A due to limited number of pediatric patients with DTC.   
Cohort 2B:  Osteosarcoma Group  
A minimum of 15 PFS-4 evaluable subjects will be assessed in cohort 2B.  The sample size 
estimates were based on Simon’s Optimal Two -Stage Design (Simon, 1989).  If fewer than [ADDRESS_1045512] 10 subjects who are alive and free of disease progression at 4 months are recorded among the 27 subjects in the cohort, study drug will be considered active in the population. The above sample size estimates are based on the following assumptions:  the null hypothesis PFS-4 (H

With the following assumptions:  p 0=25%, p 1=50%, 1-sided α=10%, β=2 0%, where p 0 is an 
unacceptable rate of PFS, p 1 is the target rate of PFS, α is the probability of declaring 
lenvatinib effective when the true rate is p 0, and β is the probability of declaring lenvatinib 
not effective if the true r ate is p 1, a sample size of 15 subjects will provide a statistical power 
of 80%.  To account for nonevaluable subjects, a total of 18 lenvatinib -naïve subjects will be 
enrolled for Cohort 3B , along with some subjects enrolled from Cohorts 1 and 2B .

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Pediatric Cancers  
Cancer occurs rarely in children and adolescents (incidence of 10 to 15 cases per 100,000 individuals <19 years of age) and the incidence is compri sed mainly of leukemias 
(approximately 30% of all cases) and solid tumors  (Ries, et al., 1999).  Current treatments for 
malignant solid tumors in pediatric patients involve a combination of chemotherapy, surgery , 
and in certain cases, radiotherapy.  This multidisciplinary treatment approach leads to an overall cure rate of 80%.  Nevertheless, cancer mortality remains the leading cause of 
disease- related death in children and adolescents between 1 and 19 years of a ge.  This 
mortality rate is due to diseases with a poor prognosis (3- year overall survival <30%), such 
as metastatic neuroblastoma, multi- metastatic bone sarcomas (osteosarcomas and Ewing ’s 
sarcomas), metastatic medulloblastomas, and refractory disease and  relapses of most of the 
pediatric solid tumors.   
7.1.1  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_763029], with less than 15% of differentiated thyroid cancer  (DTC) 
cases diagnosed at age <18 years.  However, it does account  for approximately 10% of 
malignant tumors and approximately 35% of carcinomas in children ( Bernstein and Gurney, 
1999).  In the US, approximately 350 people younger than 20 years of age are diagnosed with 
thyroid carcinoma each year  (Bernstein and Gurney, 1999) .  In Europe, annual numbers of 
new pediatric cases are  similar to the US with the exception of the geographic areas close to

 the 1986 nuclear plant accident in Chernobyl, where much higher incidence rates are 
observed ( Steliarova -Foucher , et al., 2006).  
Differentiated thyroid cancer comprises 90 % to 95% of all childhood thyroid cancers.  
Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is diagnosed in 5% to 8% of childhood thyroid cancer 
patients  (Bernstein and Gurney, 1999; Harach and Williams, 1995).  Undifferentia ted thyroid 
tumors, ie , insular and anaplastic cancers, are extremely rare in the pediatric population  
(Hassoun, et al., 1997) .  Juvenile DTC is classified as sporadic or radiation induced.  These [ADDRESS_1045529] major clinical differences ( Samaan , et al., 1987).   
Juvenile DTC appears to have several notable differences when compared to DTC in adults.  DTC in childhood is often more advanced at presentation and there is a higher risk of disease recurrence.  In addition, a higher propensity f or lymph node and distant lung metastases is 
observed in childhood DTC.  
In papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686] (PTC), which constitutes the main histologic type of DTC 
diagnosed in children, there are 2 major initiating events, rearranged transformation/papi[INVESTIGATOR_646458] (RET/PTC) and BRAF point mutation T1799A, both activating the 
mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway  (Santoro, et al., 2006) .  
RET/PTC is a chimeric gene generated by [CONTACT_763072] (RET) to the 5′terminal region of genes that are constitutively expressed in thyroid follicular cells and result in constitutively active tyrosine kinase.  There are at least 10 different types of RET/PTC of which RET/PTC1 and  
RET/PTC3 are the most common types, accounting for >90% of all rearrangements  (Xing,  
2005).
   The frequency of RET/PTC rearrangement differs substantially in various 
populations, the most important factor seems to be age:  RET/PTC rearrangements are much more frequent in younger patients ( aged 6 to 21 years of age) with PTC and especially in 
children <8 years of age.  The T1799A BRAF point mutation is the more common mutation in sporadic papi[INVESTIGATOR_763030].  It occurs in approximat ely 40 % to 
60% of all cases  (Kumagai, et al., 2004).  In contrast to adult papi[INVESTIGATOR_524696], pediatric 
tumors (both sporadic and radiation- induced) have a low (0 % to 12%) prevalence of BRAF 
mutations  (Giordano, et al., 2005).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1045530] commonly diagnosed primary malignancy of the bone, particularly in children and adolescents.  Malignancies of the bone, with an average annual incidence rate of 8.7 per million children younger than 20 years of age, comprise about 6% of childhood cancers reported by [CONTACT_763073], Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and End Results (SEER) program area from 1975 to 1995 ( Gurney , et al., 1997) .  In the US, between 650 and700 children and 
adolescents younger than 20 years of age are diagnosed with bone tumor each year of which approximately 400 are osteosarcomas and 200 are Ewing’s sarcomas  (Gurney , et al., 1997 ).  
There is a bimodal age distribution of osteosarcoma incidence.  A primary peak in osteosarcoma incidence occurs i n children and adolescents ages 0 to 24 years, the incidence 
plateaus for ages 25 to 59 years, with a second peak in the elderly (ages 60 to >85).  Current

endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) platelet -derived growth factor receptor 
(PDGFR) overexpression,  c-fos overexpression, and radiation exposure, has been associated 
with the development of osteosarcoma in laboratory models as well as humans  (Gorlick and 
Khanna, 2010 ).  A single recurrent genetic event does not seem to define this cancer.  The 
vast majority of abnormal oncogenes and tumor -suppressor gene s associated with 
osteosarcoma are also common in the most prevalent cancers  (Gorlick and Khanna, 2010).  
The use of ionizing radiation for the treatment of childhood solid tumors has been well implicated in the development of a second malignancy , with  osteosarcoma being the most 
likely to develop within the first 2 decades following treatment ( Le Vu , et al., 1988).   
7.1.3  Current Therapeutic Options  
Recurrent Pediatric DTC W hich is Refractory/Resistant to Radioiodine 
The current standard management of pediatric DTC is total or near total thyroidectomy (often with central lymph node dissection) followed by [CONTACT_763074] (
131I) ablation and then thyroid 
hormone treatment, with further surgery and ablation for recurrences.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_763031] l tumors, common involvement of cervical lymph node at presentation, and 
high recurrence rates, this approach is highly successful with a 5 year survival rate of 96% to 100% and a 20 year survival rate of over 90%. 
A subset of these pediatric/adolescent patients with recurrent relapsed DTC may  become 
refractory and/or resistant to radioiodine. Cytotoxic chemotherapy in the setting of 
131I-refractory/resistant DTC in any patient age 
group offers little to no benefit and is associated with significant toxicity.  In fact, the 2012 
ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for thyroid cancer state that “chemotherapy is no longer indicated [for treatment of advanced 
131I-refractory DTC] because of lack of effective results 
and should be replaced by [CONTACT_763075]  (Pacini ,
 et al., 2014).”  
Recurrent Pediatric and Adolescent Osteosarcoma  
About 30%  of patients with localized disease and 80% of those presenting with metastatic 
disease will relapse ( NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2014) .  Complete removal of all sites 
of metastases must be attempted as the disease is otherwise almost universally fatal  (ESMO,  
2012).  
The role of second- line chemotherapy for recurrent osteosarcoma is much less well defined 
that of surgery and there is no accepted standard regimen  (ESMO, 2012) .  Choice may take 
into account the prior disease -free interval, and often includes  ifosfamide +/ - etoposide +/ - 
carboplatin, and other active drugs  (ESMO, 2012) .  In the two largest reported series, the use 
of second- line chemotherapy correlated with limited prolongation of survival in patients with

 inoperable metastatic recurrences, while a positive correlation in operable disease was 
observed in only one of the two ( Ferrari , et al., 2003; Kempf- Bielack , et al., 2005).  
The combination of etoposide with cyclophosphamide (CPM) or ifosfamide has been 
evaluated in at least 2 clinical trials of > 20 patients  (Berger , et al., 2009; Gentet , et al., 1997) .  
The French Society of Paediatric Oncology conducted a Phase 2 trial of high -dose ifosfamide 
and moderate -dose etoposide in 27 patients with relapsed or refractory childhood 
osteosarcoma ( Gentet , et al., 1997) .  The chemotherapy regimen was 2 courses (3 -4 weeks 
apart) of ifosfamide 3 g/m2/day and etoposide 75 mg/m2/day, each given daily for 4 days 
with mesna uroprotection.  The response rate was 48% (95% confidence interval, 29-67%).  Response rate was equivalent in the sub -group of 22 patients who had previously received 
ifosfamide (4 CR, 6 PR).   
In another Phase II trial by [CONTACT_763076]  (Berger, et al., 2009) , the 
activity of 2 courses of cyclophosphamide  and etoposide was evaluated in 26 relapsed high -
risk osteosarcoma patients with a median age of 18.5 years.  The chemotherapy regimen 
consisted of cyclophosphamide 4 g/m
2 IV over 3 hours on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 
IV over 1 hour twice daily for 3 days on Days 2, 3, and 4 (total dose: 600 mg/m2) with mesna 
uroprotection.  This resulted in a 19% response rate (2 CR, 3 PR).  Progression -free survival 
at 4 months ( PFS-4) was 42%.  
In a smaller Phase 2 study reported by [CONTACT_763077]íguez -Galindo, 14 children with refractory 
osteosarcoma were given fractionated cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/day for 5 days) and 
etoposide (100 mg/m2/day for 5 days) with granulocyte colony -stimulating factor every 21 to 
28 days  (Rodriguez-Galindo, et al., 2002).   A total of 47 courses were given (median 3 per 
patient [range: 1  to 12]) .  The response rate was 28.5% (1 CR, 3 PR, in 11 evaluable 
subjects).  
In general, despi[INVESTIGATOR_763032] -line treatment, the prognosis of recurrent disease in osteosarcoma 
has remained poor, with long -term post -relapse survival of <20%  (NCCN Bone Cancer 
Guidelines, 2014).  
In light of this, the use of newer targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_763033].  Gaspar, Di Giannatale, Geoerger , and colleagues have published a detailed review 
summarizing these efforts  (Gaspar , et al., 2012).

patients aged >14 years with relapsed and unresectable osteosarcoma  (Grignani, et al., 2012) .  
The PFS -4 (primary endpoint) was 46% with a median follow -up of 3.6 months.  The 
objective response rate was 9% (3 PR, no CR).  Based on these results, the [ADDRESS_1045532] included sorafenib as a systemic therapy option for osteosarcoma patients with relapsed disease ( NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2014).

 Lenvatinib 
Lenvatinib is an  oral, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively 
inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 
VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 ( kinase domain receptor [ KDR ]), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in 
addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway -related RTKs including fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα; KIT; and RET.   Lenvatinib inhibits VEGF -driven KDR phosphorylation 
and suppre sses proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell 
(HUVEC) models.  It has demonstrated antiangiogenic activity and has shown antitumor 
effects against various human cancer xenograft models in mice ( Lenvatinib Investigator’s  
Brochure, 2014 ).  In combination with pa clitaxel or platinum- based anticancer agents, it 
showed enhanced antitumor activity in gastric cancer, non -small cell lung canc er, and 
melanoma xenografts in athymic mice  (Lenvatinib Investigator’s Brochure, 2014) .  In view 
of these properties, it is being developed as an anticancer therapy as a single agent or in  
combination with other anticancer agents.  It has exhibited anti -tumor activity in Phase 1 and 
2 clinical trials in adults; based on which, several Phase [ADDRESS_1045533] shown promising results in DTC patients in a Phase 2 trial and a Phase 3 trial in adult DTC patients  (Schlumberger M, et al. 2015) .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Angiogenesis and Pediatric Tumors - Mechanism of Action 
Angiogenesis an d Vasculogenesis in Pediatric Solid Tumors  
Pediatric tumors are highly vascularized.  As with normal tissue, the growing tumor requires an extensive network of capi[INVESTIGATOR_763034].  Moreover, the new intratumor blood vessels offer a way for tumor cells to enter the circulation and metastasize to distant organs and thus play an indispensable role in solid tumor growth and metastasis.  Angiogenesis, which is the growth of new capi[INVESTIGATOR_763035] -existing blood 
vessels, a nd vasculogenesis, which is the differentiation of precursor cells into endothelial 
cells, are the fundamental processes by [CONTACT_763079].  Angiogenesis is the result of a dynamic balance between proangiogenic factors, VEGF and platele t-derived 
growth factor (PDGF), and factors that inhibit angiogenesis such as thrombospondin- 1 and 
angiostatin  (Bid and Houghton, 2011) .  VEGF, through its binding to the RTK vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), is the most potent and specific promoter of angiogenesis known.  The PDGFR and their cognate RTK PDGFR have potent implications in modulating endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in solid tumors  (Geoerger , et 
al., 2003) .  Vasculogenesis is mainly dependent on VEGFA/VEGFR2 for migration of the 
bone marrow -derived progenitor cells and Notch signaling (DLL4) for their differentiation 
into pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells ( Stewart and Kleinerman, 2011).  
Growth Factor Receptors in Pediatric Solid Tumors  
VEGF rece ptor signaling plays a regulatory role in pediatric cancer angiogenesis via both a 
paracrine mechanism through 2 specific tyrosine kinase VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (or Flt -1) 
and VEGFR2 (or KDR) at the surface of the endothelial cells, and a VEGF autocrine loop

 involved in pediatric tumor growth (mainly rhabdomyosarcomas [RMS]  (Gee, et al., 2005 ) 
and high- grade gliomas [HGG])  (Tuettenberg , et al., 2006) .  Both angiogenesis and 
vasculogenesis appeared to be correlated with metastatic status of the disease and p oor 
outcome.  VEGFR plays a significant role in osteosarcoma, a highly vascularized tumor, and 
in DTC.  VEGF expression and serum levels correlated with increased tumor vascularity, 
metastatic potential and poorer prognosis  (Bid and Houghton, 2011).  These  results advocate 
a role for inhibition of tumor angiogenesis using anti-VEGF methods. 
Fibroblast growth factors (especially FGF2), FGF3, and vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) are some of the genes acting in multistep bone development.  Fibroblast growth 
factor receptors (FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4) seem to play a major role, the latter particularly in RMS  (Cao, et al., 2010; Hirotsu, et al., 2009; Taylor , et al., 2009) .  FGFR1 is upregulated in 
70 % of human osteosarcomas and involved in the malignant transformation  (Guagnano and  
Kauffmann, 2012).  FGF2/FGFR1 activation has been shown to induce growth inhibition, 
neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis in primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET] and Ewing’s sarcoma ( Sturla , et al., 2000; Kim, et al., 2004) .  Basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF)/FGFR1 strongly induced the motility and invasion of Ewing’s sarcoma cells  
(Kamura, et al., 2010) .  Embryonal RMS patient biopsy specimens were found to over -
express FGFR3  (Bodo, et al., 2002) .  An autocrine role of βFGF endogenous release 
controlled the different osteosarcoma phenotypes (Bodo, et al., 2002).  
High expression of the PDGFR and its ligands PDGF α and PDGF β highlight the role of the 
PDGF pathway in several pediatric tumors (eg., osteosarcoma, [ Kubo, 2008 ] glioma,  [Mauro , 
et al., 1991] diffuse pontine glioma, [ Zarghooni, et al., 2010] nephroblastoma, [ Ghanem, et  
al., 2010] Ewing sarcoma [ Schaefer , et al., 2008] ).  PDGFR expression is associated with 
clinical stage (nephroblastoma  [Ghanem , et al., 2010] ), with the metastatic status ( eg., 
Ewing ’s sarcomas,  [Schaefer , et al., 2008] medulloblastoma), and correlates with event -free 
survival ( eg., osteosarcoma [Kubo, et al., 2008] ). 
The RET protooncogene , a member of the cadherin superfamily, encodes an RTK with  a 
crucial role in neural crest development.  Different activating mutations in the RET gene are 
associated with disorders like multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A (MEN2A is characterized by [CONTACT_763080], pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism), M EN type 
2B (MEN2B is characterized by [CONTACT_763081], pheochromocytoma, a Marfanoid body habitus, mucosal and other neuromas, and intestinal tumors mostly ganglioneuromas), Hirschsprung disease, and MTC. 
Antiangiogenic Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_763036] (eg, NB  [Pacini , et al., 2012; NCCN Bone Cancer 
Guidelines, 2014], 3ES [ESMO, 2012], HGG [ Tuettenberg , et al., 2006] ).  Vascular 
normalization allows reoxygenation and hence increased radiation sensitivity or increased uptake of drugs into tumor tissue, including brain tumors  (Tuettenberg , et al., 2006) .  Drugs 
such as cediranib  (Ferrari , et al., 2003) , sorafenib ( Kempf -Bielack , et al., 2005) , and sunitinib  
(Berger , et al., 2009) , exhibited growth inhibitory activity, inducing significant prolongation

 of the time to event in pediatric solid tumor models.  Complete responses were rare in soft 
tissue sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Wilms' tumor, hepatoblastoma, ependymoma, and high- and low- grade glioma  (Gentet , et al., 1997).  
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class toxicity has been similar to adults, with an apparent lower incidence of hypertension in the pediatric population and fewer than anticipated reports of growth plate toxicity.  
Inhibition of multiple angiogenic related factors by [CONTACT_763082]:   
RTK inhibitors suppress several angiogenic factors but also other TK proto-oncogenes 
involve d in tumor growth and might be useful in tumors with complex genetic abnormalities 
such as osteosarcoma.  Several molecules are available and are currently in early clinical trials in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancer.  Phase [ADDRESS_1045534] been completed for sunitinib (inhibitor of PDGFR, VEGFR1- 3, c-kit, RET, CSF1R, Flt3) with 
observed cardiac toxicity (shortened ejection fraction) for pediatric patients with solid tumors  with prior anthracycline or radiation exposure,
 (Rodriguez-Galindo, et al., 2002) and for 
pazopanib (inhibitor of VEGFR1- 3, PDGFR α/β, c kit) with 1 partial response in 
hepatoblastoma and 3 stable disease ( Zarghooni, et al., 2010 ).  A pediatric Phase 2 trial is 
ongoing for sorafenib (inhibitor of VEGFR1- 3, PDGFR, RET, BRAF, c -kit; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
that has demonstrated clinical activity in an osteosarcoma Phase 3 study in adults  (Ghanem , 
et al., 2010) .  A vandetanib (inhibitor of VEGFR2 -3, EGFR, RET) Phase 1/2 trial in children 
and adolescents with hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma started recruiting in 2007 and is expected  to continue recruiting up to 2014 ( Schaefer , et al., 2008).  
All these molecules are well tolerated with a similar toxicity profile (e g, arterial 
hypertension, proteinuria, fatigue, gastrointestinal discomfort) due to VEGF pathway inhibition. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Experience with  Lenvatinib  
As of 27 Apr 2013, 13 studies in Phase 1/1b have been completed in the adult population; [ADDRESS_1045535], 2 drug-d rug interaction

The terminal elimination half -life (t ½) of lenvatinib is about 28 hours for both the tablet and

not have any significant effect on absorption, indicating that lenvatinib may be administered 
with or without food (E7080-A001-003). A bioavailability study was conducted in adult

Cohort 3A (Combination Dose -Finding): To define the RD of lenvatinib in combination 
with ifosfamide  and etoposide in subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.  This 
cohort will be open for enroll ment  in parallel with Cohort 2 (Single -Agent Expansion).   
After defining the RD of lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy in Cohort 3A, 
subsequent osteosarcoma subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 2B (Single -Agent

would only be assigned to Cohort 2B.  
Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion):  To test the efficacy of lenvatinib in combination 
with ifosfamide  and etoposide in subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma.  
Subjects with osteosarcoma who have enrolled into Cohort s 1 or 2B and experienced 
progressive disea se on lenvatinib  (optional enrollment for subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2B) as 
well as lenvatinib -naïve subjects with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma will be candidates 
for enrollment in Cohort 3B.  The efficacy analyses will be based on lenvatinib -naïve 
subjects, while subjects from Cohorts 1 and 2B will only be summarized as appropriate. 
The study will include 3 phases:  Pretreatment (screening  and baseline), Treatment  (includes 
a Run-In Period for Cohort 1), and Post- treatment follow -up.   
9.1.1  Pretreatment Phase (All Cohorts)  
The pretreatment phase will last no longer than 28 days and will include a Screening Period 
and a Baseline Period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening (All Cohorts)  
Screening will occur between Day - [ADDRESS_1045542] of any screening procedures or assessments.  (Procedures to be followed when obtaining informed consent are detailed in Section  5.3.)

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Baseline (All Cohorts)  
The purpose of the Baseline Period is to confirm protocol eligibility as specified in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (as detailed in Section 9.3.1 and Section 9.3.2).  Results of 
baseline assessments must be obtained prior to the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1 Day 1).  Baseline assessments may be performed on Day -1 or on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to dosing .  
Clinical laboratory tests (Table 6), including a pregnancy test (where applicable), should be 
performed within [ADDRESS_1045544] dose of study drug. 
 
Subjects who complete the Baseline Period and continue to meet the criteria for inclusion/exclusion ( as detailed in Section 9.3.1 and S ection 9.3.2) will begin the Treatment 
Phase of this study. 
9.1.2  Treatment Phase  
In all the cohorts, lenvatinib is administered daily (QD) and 1 treatmen t cycle is defined as a 
28-day period for Cohorts 1, 2A , and 2B and a 21-day period for Cohorts 3A and 3B.  A new 
treatment cycle begins every 28 days  for Single -Agent Cohorts 1, 2A , and 2B or 21- day 
period for Combination- Treatment Cohorts 3A and 3B , irrespective of dose interruptions.  
See Section 9.4.1 for rules regarding the calculation of lenvatinib dose based on body surface 
area ( BSA ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort 1  (Single -Agent Dose- Finding)  
This cohort will identify  the RD of lenvatinib  as a single agent in children and adolescents 
with relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumors .  The RD in this study will be defined as 
the dose that has a DLT rate closest to the targeted 20% rate . 
Dose -Escalation  in Cohort 1 Cycle 1:  
Subjects 6 to <18 years, will enroll in Cohort 1 prior to subjects 2 to <[ADDRESS_1045545] will be assigned a dose in accordance with the rules of the TiTE- CRM design as 
detailed in Statistical Methods, Section [IP_ADDRESS].  The TiTE- CRM design is an accepted 
adaptive design used in Phase 1 trials and allows continuous accrual throughout the study 
while using the 4 -week toxicity endpoint as the basis for dose -escalation.   Four experimental  
doses of lenvatinib may be investigated in Cohort 1 as displayed in Table 1 .

 The starting dose (Dose Level 1) of lenvatinib for this cohort is 11 mg/m2 QD 
(approximately 80% of the adult RD of 24 mg QD).  The maximum daily dose should not 
exceed 24  mg.  If the 11 mg/m2 dose is not safe and tolerable, the dose will be de- escalated to 
9 mg/m2 (Dose Level  -1). 
Determination as to whether a subject has experienced a DLT will be made by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_763037]  [IP_ADDRESS], and as 
needed with the Protocol Steering Committee ( PSC).  At least 2 subjects should receive the 
full 4 -week study treatment or report a DLT (at the starting dose) and complete the DLT 
evaluations before escalation to the next dose level. Intra- subject dose escalation will not be 
allowed . Subjects who discontinue the study during Cycle 1 (Cycle 1 Day 1 to  Cycle 1 Day 
28) for any reason other than DLT will be replaced.   
Intra subject dose -escalation prior to determining the RD will be allowed only for subjects 2 
to <6 years who can escalate lenvatinib dose when they enter Cohort 1 Cycle 1 from the Run -
In Period as described below. 
Dose -escalation for Subjects 2 to <6 years  old:

mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_1045547] 2 to <[ADDRESS_1045548] in all subsequent calculations will be considered as Cohort 1 Dose Level -1

Run- In Period without any DLT) only after:  (1) at least 6 subjects 6 to <[ADDRESS_1045550] 
either completed 4  week s of treatment in Cycle 1 or reported DLTs during Cycle 1, and (2) 
single -agent lenvatinib has been evaluated and considered by [CONTACT_763083] 6 to <18 years of age.  When a 
subjec t 2 to < [ADDRESS_1045551] will receive a dose that is 
either (1) one level below what is calculated from TiTE -CRM if the calculated dose is greater 
than 9 mg/m2, based on the DLT data from all previous subjects from 2 to <18 years of age, 
or (2) 9 mg/m2 if the TiTE- CRM calculated dose is 9 mg/m2.  Consequently, that subject’s 
DLT data in Cycle [ADDRESS_1045552] has been determined, subjects treated at a lower dose level  should continue to 
be treated at that dose level.

The RD of Single-Agent lenvatinib determined in Cohort 1 is 14 mg/m2 as recommended by 
[CONTACT_763059]-CRM and confirmed by [CONTACT_763060].  Subjects in Cohorts 2A and 2B will receive 14 mg/m2

 Lenvatinib is administered daily as a QD dose, and ifosfamide  and etoposide will be 
administered on Days 1 to 3 of each cycle  for a total of 5 cycles .  Each Chemotherapy cycle 
is repeated every 21 days.  Six subjects with osteosarcoma (who have not received prior 
lenvatinib) will be enrolled first to Cohort 3A at the Starting Dose of lenvatinib (20% below 
the Single -Agent RD in Cohort 1) in combination with ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day for 3 
days (ifosfamide total dose 9  g/m2) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day for 3 days (etoposide total 
dose 300 mg/m2).  Subjects with lenvatinib dose capped after BSA adjustment (dose must not 
exceed 24 mg daily) actually take lower dose level than assigned.  If a subject with capped 
dose experiences a DLT, the DLT data from that subject will be counted to determine the RD 
of the combination treatment.  A subject with capped dose who does not experience a DLT 
will be replaced for the purpose of determining the RD.  
DLTs occurring dur ing Cycle 1 will be evaluated and the next 6 subjects will be assigned a 
dose based on the rules for Dose Escalation and Dose De -Escalation as follows:  
a. If ≤1 out of 6 subjects experiences a  DLT at the s tarting dose during Cycle 1 (Day  
1 to Day  21), then a ssign 6 more subjects to the next higher dose level of 
lenvatinib (RD from Cohort 1) and keep the chemotherapy dose the same ( starting 
dose).  
b. If ≥2 out of 6 subjects experience a DLT at the starting dose during Cycle 1 (Day 
1 to Day 21), then follow  the instructions below ; 
i. If ≥2 subjects experience hematologic DLT and ≤ [ADDRESS_1045556] experiences non -
hematologic  DLT , then assign 6 more subjects to 20% lower doses ( De-
escalation 1 ) of ifosfamide and etoposide  and keep the lenvatinib dose the 
same; or  
ii. If ≥2 subjects experience non -hematologic DLT and ≤ [ADDRESS_1045557] experiences 
a hematologic  DLT , then assign 6 more subjects to a 20% lower dose of 
lenvatinib ( De-escalation 1)  and keep the ifosfamide and etoposide  doses the 
same; or  
iii. If ≥2 subjects experience hematol ogic DLTs and ≥2 subjects experiences 
non-hematologic DLTs, then assign 6 more subjects to 20% lower doses of 
lenvatinib, ifosfamide , and etoposide  each ( De-escalation 1 ); or 
iv. If only [ADDRESS_1045558]

[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort 3B  (Combination Expansion) 
Subjects with either len vatinib -naïve relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma or osteosarcoma 
subjects who progress on s ingle -agent lenvatinib in Cohorts 1 or  2B (optional enrollment)  
will receive lenvatinib (at the RD  identified from  Cohort 3A) in combination with ifosfamide  
and etoposide , provided the combination of lenvatinib, ifosfamide , and etoposide in Cohort 
3A (C ombination Dose-Finding) is determined to be safe and tolerable.   
Osteosarcoma subjects who experience progressive disease in  Cohort s 1 or  2B and choose to 
receive the combination therapy of lenvatinib with ifosfamide  and etoposide should meet 
only inclusion criteria numbers 6 through 17 and all the exclusion criteria except  Criterion 
Number 6.   
Subjects in Cohorts 3A and 3B will receive ifosfamide and etoposide for a maximum of 5 
cycles.  Subjects who discontinue ifosfamide and etoposide in Cohorts 3A and 3B (e.g., due 
to toxicity) prior to completing 5 cycle s may continue on single -agent lenvatinib if they are 
benefiting from the treatment at the discretion of the investigator.   Subjects who discontinue 
lenvatinib prior to completing 5 cycles may continue on ifosfamide and etoposide  at the 
investigator’s disc retion for [ADDRESS_1045560]- treatment (All Cohorts)  
The Post -treatment Follow -up begins when the subject discontinues treatment.  After subject 
discontinues treatment, an Off -Treatment Visit and the procedures noted in the Schedule of 
Assessments Tables ( Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 ) should be completed within [ADDRESS_1045561] to follow-up (see Section 9.3.3).  
Subjects who discontinue treatment without disease progression will have tumor assessments 
performed every 6 or 8 weeks (per the appropriate tumor assessment schedule) for up to [ADDRESS_1045562] of care.

 As required by [CONTACT_94201], the following estimates are provided:  
• The study will begin in December  2014 and will end on or be fore December  2017. 
• The maximum estimated period for the study is anticipated to be approximately 
[ADDRESS_1045563], and evaluate the activity  of lenvatinib as single -agent or in combination 
with chemotherapy ( ifosfamide  and etoposide).  The study will be conducted in 5 cohorts:   
• Cohort 1, a single -agent dose- finding study of  lenvatinib in children and adolescents with 
relapsed or refractory solid tumors to determine the RD;  
• Cohort 2, an  assessment of the efficacy of lenvatinib at the RD in subjects  with either  
o 131I-refractory DTC  (Cohort 2A) or  
o relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B);  
• Cohort 3A, a combination dose-finding study of lenvatinib in combination with 
ifosfamide  and etoposide in subjects with osteosarcoma to determine the RD of the 
combination; and   
• Cohort 3B, a combination expansion study with lenvatinib at the RD, in combination 
with ifosfamide  and etoposide in subjects with  osteosarcoma who had either disease 
progression on lenvatinib (from Cohort s 1 or 2B) or who are lenvatinib -naïve.   
In Cohort 1, t he Time -to-Event Continuous Re assessment Method (T iTE-CRM  [Cheung and 
Chappell, 2000] ) will be used to identify the RD  of lenvatinib.  TiTE -CRM is an accepted 
adaptive design that is statistically robust to evaluate RD in most dose -escalation Phase 1 
studies ( Doussau, et al., 2012).  Single agent lenvatinib will be administered at the RD in 
Cohort 2 of the study. The 80% starting dose is based on consensus reached for pediatric 
Phase 1 trials  (Smith , et al., 1998).  
Cohort 2 will evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib in subjects (1) with  relapsed or 
131I refractory DTC  (Cohort 2A)  based upon ORR  for subjects with measurable disease and 
BOR for all subjects as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 ; and (2) with osteosarcoma (Cohort 2B) 
based upon PFS -4, as assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1.  Tumors under study  in Cohort 2 may be 
modified based on preliminary safety and efficacy signals observed in Cohort 1 of the study.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Blood Pressure  
For children, blood pressure varies by  [CONTACT_649822].  Blood pressure will be assessed in terms of percentile for sex, age and 
height/length.  Guidelines to sex, age , and height -specific percentiles of blood pressure is  
provided in Appendix 7 and Appendix 8.  Blood pressure that is consistently above the 95th 
percentile [for subjects age 18- 25 yea rs BP ≤140/90 mm Hg] for age and height/ length 
requires further evaluation.  A referral to a cardiologist is recommended for patients who 
develop hypertension during the study.  Ideally, cardiovascular assessments and the 
management of hypertension should be supervised by a cardiologist.  Exercise, excitement, 
coughing, crying and struggling may raise the systolic pressure of children as much as 
40 to  50 mmHg greater than their u sual level.  Variability in blood pressure in children of 
approximately the same age and body build should be expected and serial measurements should always be obtained when evaluating a patient with hypertension.  BP values for 
management of hypertension for subjects 18 to 25 years of age are included in parenthesis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Hypertension 
Hypertension is a recognized side- effect of treatment with drugs inhibiting vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling.  Investigators should therefore ensure that 
subjects enrolled to receive treatment with lenvatinib have BP <95th percentile [ BP ≤150/90 
mm Hg] for sex, age, and height/length at the time of study entry and, if known to be 
hypertensive, have been on a stable  dose of antihypertensive therapy fo r at least [ADDRESS_1045584] arted as soo n as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥ 95th 
percentile [ BP ≥140 mm Hg ] or diastolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [ BP ≥90 mm Hg] ) is confirmed 
on [ADDRESS_1045585]’s clinical circumstances and follow standard medical practice.  For previously normotensive subjects, monotherapy with one of the classes of 
antihyperte nsives shoul d be started when systolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [ BP ≥140 mm Hg] or 
diastolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [ BP ≥90 mm Hg] is first observed on 2 assessments obtained 1 
hour apart.  For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or 1 or more agents of a different class of 
antihypertensive should be added.  For subjects with hypertension and proteinuria, treatm ent 
with an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin- II receptor antagonist 
is preferred.  
Lenvatinib  should be withheld in any instances where a subject is at imminent risk to develop 
a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk facto rs for severe complications of uncontrolled 
hypertension (eg, BP ≥99th percentile  [BP ≥160/100 mm Hg] , significant risk factors for 
cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant comorbidities).  Once the 
subject has been on the same antih ypertensive medications for at least 48 hours and the BP is 
controlled, lenvatinib  should be resumed as described below.

 During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥99th percentile  [BP ≥160 mm Hg]  
or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥100 mm H g] must have their BP monitored every 2 
weeks (on Day 15 or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP has been <95th 
percentile [≤ 150 mm Hg] and diastolic BP has been <95th percentile  [≤ 95 mm Hg]  for 3 
consecutive months.  If a new event  of systolic BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥160 mm Hg] or 
diastolic BP ≥99th percentile  [BP ≥100 mm Hg]  occurs, the subject must resume the Day 15 
evaluation until systolic BP has been <95th percentile [ ≤ 150 mm Hg] and diastolic BP has 
been <95th percentile [ ≤ 95 mm Hg]  for 3 consecutive months.  
The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥160 mm Hg] or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile  [BP ≥100 mm Hg]  confirmed 
on repeat measurements after an hour:  
• Continue lenvatinib  and institute antihypertensive therapy for subjects not already 
receiving antihypertensive medication.  
• For those subjects already on antihypertensive medication, the dose of the current agent may be increased, if appropriate, or 1 or more agent s of a different class of 
antihypertensive should be added.  
• If systolic BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥160 mm Hg] or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile  
[BP ≥100 mm Hg]  persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_649768], then lenvatinib 
administration should be interrupted and restarted at a lower dose QD (one dose level 
reduction [ 20%] as specified in  Table 2) only when systolic BP <95th percentile [BP 
≤150 mm Hg] and diastolic BP <95th percentile [ BP ≤95 mm Hg] and the subject has 
been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours.  
o If systolic BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥160 mm H g] or diastolic BP ≥99th 
percentile [BP ≥100 mm H g] recurs  despi[INVESTIGATOR_763039] (either by [CONTACT_3137] a different class of antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted and restarted at a lower dose QD (one dose level reduction [ 20%] as specified in the table above) only when systolic 
BP <95th percentile [ BP ≤150 mm Hg] and diastolic BP <95th percentile [ BP 
≤ 95 mm Hg] and the subject has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Proteinuria 
Regular assessment for proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9).  Guidelines for assessment and management of 
proteinuria are summarized as follows:  
• Initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_3496]:   If proteinuria ≥ 2+ is detected on urine dipstick testing, 
study drug will be continued and a spot protein- creatinine ratio test and if possible a 
24-hour urine collection for total protein will be obtained as soon as possible within 
72 hours to verify the grade of proteinuria.  Grading according to CTCAE v4.03 
(Appendix 2) will be based on the protein- creatinine ratio.  And wherever possible 
also on the 24- hour urinary protein result  per investigators discretion .  Management 
of lenvatinib  administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria according to 
Table 3.  
• During the Treatment Period, urine dipstick t esting for subjects with proteinuria ≥ 2+ 
should be performed every 2 weeks (on Day 15 or more frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months.  Any 
subsequent increases in the level of proteinuria ≥ 2+ on urine dipstick testing must be 
confirmed with a spot protein- creatinine ratio test and if possible a 24- hour urinary 
protein test per investigators discretion which will be assessed and graded and managed according to the dose reduction and interruption instructions provided in the 
table above.  If a new event of proteinuria ≥ 2+ occurs, the subject must resume the 
Day 15 urine dipstick testing for evaluation of proteinuria until results are 1+ or negative for 3 consecutive months. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Hepat otoxicity  
Regular monitoring of liver function tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin levels) should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 ) and as clinically indicated.  If signs/symptoms 
indicating liver injury occur, instructions contained in the table for dose reduction and interruptions of the protocol should be followed  (see Table 3 ), for Study Treatment Dose 
Reductio n and Interruption Instructions) .  Appropriate supportive care should be provided 
together with close monitoring.  If hepatic failure occurs the study drug must be 
discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Thromboembolic Events  
Subjects should be advised to pay attention to symptoms suggestive of venous thromboembolic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, deep vein thrombosis  signs including 
lower -extremity swelling, redness and warmth to touch or tenderness.  In case any of these 
symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the

care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If a subject experiences life-
threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reactions, including pulmonary embolism, the study drug must be discontinued. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Hypocalcemia 
Serum calcium should be monitored monthly per the Schedule of Assessments. Hypocalcemia should be treated per institutional guidelines (eg, using appropriate calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Acute Abdominal Pain 
Initial management of acute abdominal pain in these study subjects should be focused on treating the underlying cause where possible, ensuring appropriate hydration/rehydration, and symptomatic pain improvement consistent with subject’s age and in accordance to local and institutional standards of care.  Appropriate supportive care  should be provided together with 
close monitoring. 
For adverse events of abdominal pain believed  related to lenvatinib or more specific adverse 
events believed  related to lenvatinib that result in the symptom of abdominal pain, 
instructions contained in Table [ADDRESS_1045587] be 
discontinued. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including diarrhea should be managed by [CONTACT_763086].  If the symptoms persist (e g, diarrhea for more than 10 days) , Study 
Treatment Interruption and Reduction guideline should be followed.  Gastrointestinal 
symptoms should be monitored closely and evaluated using CT, Contrast -Enhanced MRI, 
ultrasound, or other diagnostic imaging if clinically indicated, at the  investigator’s discretion.   
All GI symptoms should be recorded in the di ary provided.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Storage Conditions  
Lenvatinib  will be stored in accordance with the labeled storage conditions.  The expi[INVESTIGATOR_763040]/packing is completed 
or will be based on for mulation testing, and will therefore be described in the “Procedures for 
Handling Investigational Drug.”  The sponsor will prepare the “Procedures for Handling 
Investigational Drug," which will be provided to the investigator  and the designated 
pharmacist.  
Ifosfamide  and etoposide will be stored in accordance with the labeled  storage conditions. 
Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the study drug is  
maintained within an established temperature range.  The investigator or  designee (or if  
regionally required, the head of the medical institution) is responsible for ensuring that the  
temperature is monitored throughout the total duration of the study and that records are  
maintained.  The temperature should be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_103338]-house 
validated data acquisition system, a mechanical recording device, such as a calibrated chart  
recorder, or by [CONTACT_3177], such that minimum and maximum thermometric values over a  
specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required.  
9.4.4  Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is an open- label  study.  All subjects who provide signed informed consent and /or assent 
to participate in this study and satisfy all eligibility requirements (see Section  9.3) will be 
assigned to [ADDRESS_1045592] of lenvatinib in Cohort 1, Cohort s 2A, 2B , and 3A 
will begin enrollment in parallel.  Osteosarcoma subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 2 B 
or Cohort 3A .  Approximately 27 to 42 subjects divided into t he 2 malignancy groups 
(approximately 12 subjects with 131I refractory DTC and 15 to 30 subjects with 
osteosarcoma) will be enrolled in Cohort 2.  Approximately 12 to 24 subjects with 
osteosarcoma will be enrolled in Cohort 3A (Dose -Finding combination).   
Enrollment in Cohort 3B will start after Combination RD of lenvatinib is identified in Cohort 
3A.  After defining the RD of lenvatinib in combination with chemotherapy ( ifosfamide  and 
etoposide) in Cohort 3A, subsequent osteosarcoma subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 
2B (Single -Agent Expansion) or Cohort 3B (Combination Expansion), depending on whether 
the subject is deemed by [CONTACT_2418] a candidate for ifosfamide  and etoposide.  If 
not, the subject would only be assigned to Cohort 2B.

 Cohort 3B will enroll approximately 18 lenvatinib –naïve subjects with osteosarcoma, along 
with some subjects who progress ed in Cohorts 1 or  2B. 
9.4.5  Selection of Doses in the Study  
The starting dose of lenvatinib for Cohort 1 is 11 mg/m2 QD, which is 80% of the adult RD 
of 24 mg QD.  The 80% starting dose is based on the consensus reached for pediatric Phase 1 
trials  (Smith , et al., 1998).  The starting dose of lenvatinib used in Cohort 3A will be 20% 
lower than the RD of lenvatinib identified in Cohort 1.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_1045593] should not take another dose until the next scheduled dose.   
Study drug(s) should be administered at the clinic on PK sampling days.  All scheduled visits 
must be co nducted as per protocol, irrespective of treatment interruption.  If holidays or 
personal schedules make administration impossible on the scheduled days, then 
administration should be resumed as soon as possible.

9.4.8  Prior and Concomit ant Therapy  
All prior medications ( including over -the- counter medications) administered [ADDRESS_1045594] during 
the course of the study (starting at the date of informed consent) until [ADDRESS_1045595]’s health and  that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of 
or interact with lenvatinib  may be continued during the study. 
Drugs that are not prohibited for concomitant use include drugs used to treat complications or adverse events  or drugs used to ameliorate symptoms ( including blood products, blood 
transfusions, fluid transfusions, antibiotics, and antidiarrheal drugs), may be given at the discretion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation of ( or to 
interact with) lenvat inib.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug -Drug Interactions  
The weak inhibitory effect on CYP enzymes (in vitro) exhibited by [CONTACT_454510] a low 
risk of lenvatinib interference with the PK of other drugs co -administered in usual clinical 
practice.  Simultaneous CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitions by [CONTACT_763088] (15% – 19%) 
increased systemic exposure to lenvatinib after oral administration as measured by [CONTACT_763089].  Since no change was observed in half -life, t max, or t lag, the slight increase in 
systemic exposure is probably related to a decrease in first pass metabolism.  However, since 
the magnitude of the change is small, coadministration of lenvatinib with CYP3A4/P -gp 
inhibitors is not of cli nical concern.  Similarly, PK data did not suggest any major effects of 
rifampin on the exposure or disposition of lenvatinib.  Following administration of a single 
dose of lenvatinib with a single dose of rifampin, lenvatinib exposure increased about 31%.   
In contrast, following administration of multiple doses of rifampin, free lenvatinib exposure 
was reduced about 9% and about 18% for total lenvatinib.  These findings suggest that there 
is no clinically meaningful influence of either P -gp inhibition (single dose of rifampin) or 
simultaneous P -gp and CYP3A4 induction (multiple doses of rifampin) on lenvatinib PK. 
 
The locally approved product label or applicable SmPC for ifosfamide  and etoposide should 
be referenced for any concomitant therapy use with ifo sfamide and etoposide. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prohibited Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3513].  If subjects receive 
additional antitumor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy  with well- known 
direct antitu mor activity against the subject’s malignancy , palliative radiotherapy  (other than 
as described below) , or immunotherapy, this will be judged to represent evidence of disease 
progression, and study medication will be discontinued.  These subjects should complete all 
off-treatment assessments and continue to be followed for survival in the Post -treatment 
Follow -Up. 
Prophyla ctic use of G -CSF is not permitted during this study  for Cohorts 1, 2A , and 2B.

TUMOR RESPONSE ASSESSMENTS  
Tumor assessment will be performed based on RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix 1).  Investigator -
determined response assessments at each assessment time point will be entered onto the appropriate CRF.  Subjects must have evaluable disease or measurable  disease based on 
RECIST 1.1. 
At Screening  
CT/MRI scans of the brain, neck (DTC only) chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease  (bone), plus any areas of newly suspected disease will be performed at screening.  
Historical scans (within prior 28 days) that do not follow the guidelines completely may be used to demonstrate eligibility.   For subjects with 
131I refractory DTC, historical scans 
(within prior 12 months) that do not follow the guidelines completely may be used to demonstrate eligibility.  
During Treatment Phase 
For Cohort [ADDRESS_1045605]/MRI scans of neck (DTC only), chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other

techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) as was used for the screening 
assessments should be utilized across all time points to allow consistent comparison of 
lesions.  After treatment discontinuation  for a reason other than disease progression, tumor 
assessments should continue to be performed every 8 weeks (for Single -Agent Cohorts) or 6  
weeks (for Combination-Cohorts) until documentation of progression or start of a new 
anticancer agent.  Screening CT scans should be performed with oral and i odinated IV 
contrast and MRI scans should be performed with IV gadolinium chelate.   Post- screening 
scans may be performed without contrast if a medical contraindication develops while on study treatment.   If iodinated IV contrast is contraindicated, chest CT should be done without 
IV contrast
.  MRI should be performed for all other body regions (with gadolinium unless 
contraindicated ( eg, sever e renal dysfunction). 
CT scans should be diagnostic quality spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]/multidetector CT with oral and iodinated IV contrast, and the MRI scans should be performed with IV gadolinium chelate.  Scans of the

performed with a t- mm contiguous slice reconstruction algorithm.  If body MRI scans are 
performed, contiguous slices of [ADDRESS_1045611], and the other body scans should be done with MRI with gadolinium chelate

The same imaging modality and image -acquisition protocol (including use or non- use of 
contrast) should be used consiste ntly across all time  points to allow consistent comparison of 
lesions.  Low-dose non- contrast CT transmission scans from a positron emission 
tomography- CT (PET- CT) combinati on scanner are not acceptable.  Ultrasound should not 
be used for radiographic tumor assessment.  A chest x -ray or skeletal x -ray which clearly 
demonstrates a new metastatic lesion may be used to document progression in lieu of the CT/MRI scans.  
If subcutaneous masses or nodes are palpable (eg, bulky) and are assessable by [CONTACT_649835], the radiographic (CT/MRI) technique should be used for the assessment of target and non- target lesions.

 PHARMACOGENOMIC /PHARMACOGENETIC ASSESSMENTS  
Archived, fixed tumor tissue will be collected (if available) for assessment of mutations and 
other genetic alterations or proteins that may be important in the development and progression of cancer as well as for potential use in diagnostic development. 
A blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis.  The DNA may be analyzed 
for genes associated with lenvatinib absorption, distribution, metabol ism, excretion (ADME) 
and to validate mutations suspected of functional relevance (using in silico prediction) to 
determine exclusivity to tumor sample.  The DNA will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not currently have.  
Data obtained from the PD and PG samples will be used for research.  The PD and PG 
samples will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA, RNA, and protein) may be stored for up to [ADDRESS_1045614] reaches the age of 18 years (or 16 years in the [LOCATION_006]) while on the study, and 
becomes competent to give informed consent, his/her consent will be obtained using separate  
ICFs to continue the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) v 4.03 grades (for both increasing and 
decreasing severity), and seriou s adverse events ( SAE s); regular laboratory evaluation of 
hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values;  periodic measurement of vital signs and 12-
lead ECGs; and echocardiograms, Lansky play score or 
Karnofsky  performance status  score, 
physical examinatio ns, and height assessments  as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9) .  A diary will be provided to each subject to capture any 
abnormal gastr ointestinal symptoms ( eg, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, cramps) 
experienced during the study. Fecal occult blood will be monitored regularly during the study.  
Skeletal bone growth will be assessed by [CONTACT_763063], thereafter at Day 1 of each cycle during the Treatment Phase for Cohort 1 (and Day 1 of 
every 3 cycles for cohorts 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B) , 
at the  Off- treatment V isit, and every [ADDRESS_1045615] -treatment Follow -up for 1 year.  Proximal tibial growth plate x -rays will be 
done at Baseline  and at the O ff-treatment Visit. Postbaseline,  only open growth plates will be 
further assessed.

 Clinical and laboratory toxicities/symptomatology will be graded according to Common 
Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 3 (see Appendix 2) .  
ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS OF INTEREST  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation in a subject administered an investigational product.  An AE does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug( s) are lenvatinib, etoposide, and ifosfamide .  
The criteria for identifying AEs in this study are: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign ( including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease.  However, worsening of the primary disease should be captured under efficacy assessments as disease progression rather than as an AE.  
• Any deterioration in nonprotocol -required measurements of a laboratory value or 
other clinical test (eg , ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, 
or discontinuation of study drug 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg , hea dache) not present 
pretreatment ( Baseline)  
• An abnormal laboratory test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention, whether prescribed in the protocol or not. 
A laboratory result should be considered by [CONTACT_76702]:  
• Results in the withdrawal of study drug 
• Results in withholding of study drug pending some investigational outcome 
• Results in an intervention, based on medical evaluation (eg , potassium supplement for 
hypokale mia) 
• Is an out-of- range laboratory value that in the investigator’s judgment fulfills the 
definitions of an AE with regard to the subject’s medical profile 
 
All AEs observed during the clinical study will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless 
of rel ationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the study informed consent form  until [ADDRESS_1045616] dose of study 
treatment .  Subjects who fail s creening primarily due to AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading 
to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposition CRF.   
Abnormal laboratory values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is be ing reported as an AE.  Any laboratory abnormality

incorporating Amendment 04  E7080 -G000 -207 
 
 
 
Eisai  
FINAL:  2 2 Nov 2019  Confidential  Page 98 of 165  
 considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to review all laboratory findings in all subjects and 
determine if they constitute an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE.   
Abnormal ECG ( QTc) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as  an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc interval is >480 or a QTc 
increase of ≥[ADDRESS_1045617]’s last dose, or until resolution, 
whichever comes first.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, 
to stabilization.  
Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_763091].  
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Event ( CTCAE v 4.03) ( Appendix 2).     
Investigators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both increasing and decreasing severity).  All adverse events reported using CTCAE classification and graded as 4 or 5 are to be considered serious.  Adverse events that are not reported in the CTCAE will be graded 
on a 4-point scale (mild, moderate, severe, and life- threatening).  
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are: 
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment  
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
Clinical Study Protocol  
incorporating Amendment 04  E7080 -G000 -207 
 
 
 
Eisai  
FINAL:  2 2 Nov 2019  Confidential  Page 99 of 165  
 • The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event  
• The presence of nonstudy, treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event  
Classification of Causality  
Not Related:  A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility  
Related:  A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility.  The investigator must further qualify the degree of certainty as “possible” or 
“probable .” 
Serious Adverse Events and Other Events of Interest  
A serious adverse event ( SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
event as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ( in the child of a subj ect who was exposed to the 
study drug)  
Other important medical events should also be considered SAEs.  These events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], when based on 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes in the definition of SAE listed above.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such 
situations.  
In addition to the above, other events of interest include pregnancy overdose, misuse, abuse, 
or medication error; and any treatmen t-emergent significant laboratory abnormality  (TEAV) .  
These events of interest are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered 
as SAEs only if they meet one  of the above criteria.  All AEs associated with events of 
interest are to be reported on the CRF whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.   
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.

Dose Reduction and Interruption Instructions, Table [ADDRESS_1045620] samples for 
analysis at the local laboratory at the same time.    
A laboratory abnormality may meet the criteria to qualify as an AE as described in this protocol (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the 
AE corresponding to the laboratory abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. 
For laboratory abnormalities meeting the  criteria of SAEs (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), the site must 
send the SAE report including the laboratory report ( as regionally required) to the SAE fax 
number or email provided in the Investigator File. 
VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS  
Vital sign measurements (ie , systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [per minute] ), body temperature ( in centigrade), we ight [kg]), 
and height (cm)  will be obtained at the visits designated i n the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9) by a validated method.  Blood pressure and pulse will be 
measured after the subject has been resting for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be 
performed on the same arm, preferably by [CONTACT_3194].  For subj ects with an elevated BP 
(≥95th percentile for sex, age, and height/length) it should be confirmed by [ADDRESS_1045621] 5 minutes apart.  Subjects with e levated BP (≥ 99th percentile for sex, age 
and height/length) must have their BP monitored every 2 weeks (on Day 15 or more frequently as clinically  indicated) until BP has been <95th percentile for [ADDRESS_1045622] resume the Day 15  
evaluation until BP has been <95th percentile for 3 consecutive months.   
PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS  
Physical examinations will be performed as designated i n the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9).  A comprehensive physical examination (including a 
neurological examination) will be performed at Screening, Baseline (only if screening physical examinati on was per formed > 7 days prior to C ycle 1 Day 1), Cycle  1 Day 8 
(Cohorts 3A and 3B), C ycle 1 Day 15 (Single -Agent) , Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at 
the off -treatment assessment.  A symptom- directed physical examination will be performed 
on C ycle 1 Day 1 and at any time during the study, as clinically indicated.  Documentation of 
the physical examination will be included in the source documentation at the site.  Only

be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. 
ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS  
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated i n the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 7 , 
Table 8 and Table 9 ).  Complete, standardized, 12- lead ECG recordings that permit all 12 
leads to be displayed on a single p age with an accompanying lead II rhythm strip below the 
customary 3 × 4 lead format are to  be used.  In addition to a rhythm strip, a minimum of  3 
full complexes should be recorded from each lead simultaneously.  Subjects mus t be in the 
recumbent position for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG. 
An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the ECG abnormality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF. For ECG abnormalities meeting criteria of an SAE (see  Serious Adverse Events and O ther 
Events of Interest ), the study site must fax the SAE report including the ECG report to the 
number indicated in the Investigator File using the SAE reporting form (see  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
OTHER SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Pregnancy Test  
A serum β -hCG test will be performed for  females of childbearing potential (see definition 
included in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, Sections 9.3.1and  9.3.2) .  A serum or urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and Baseline (or within [ADDRESS_1045623] dose of study medication)  and at the O ff-treatment Visit in women of childbearing 
potential.  Blood and urine samples will be taken at designated time points as specified in the

All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, must be reported on a completed SAE form by [CONTACT_36600] [ADDRESS_1045662]’s last dose, whichever occurs  first.  All SAEs 
must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  A ny SAE

procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of the length of time that has 
passed since study completion. 
The detailed contact [CONTACT_36602].  
For urgent safety issues,  please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to 
the subject and contact [CONTACT_763095].  
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality.  
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24 hours  of its 
receipt.  I f the follow -up information changes the investigator’s assessment of causality, 
this should also be noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
Preliminary SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by [CONTACT_3582][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, and other documents requested by [CONTACT_456].

 The investigator should notify his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, 
in accordance with local requirements.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to the sp onsor and/or the designated CRO monitor and filed in the Trial Master File.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding 
Any pregnancy in which the estimated date of conception is either before the last visit or within [ADDRESS_1045663] be 
reported. 
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug, this should 
be rep orted regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment.  
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous abortion are considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same  
time frame and in the same format as all other SAEs (see Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events [ Section  [IP_ADDRESS]]).  
Pregnancies or exposure to study drug through breastfeeding must be reported by [CONTACT_283587] [ADDRESS_1045664] be withdrawn from the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Events Associated with Special Situations  
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIAT ED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE , MISUSE , 
ABUSE , OR MEDICATION ERROR  
Adverse events associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error refer to AEs associated with uses of the study drug outside of that specified by [CONTACT_760].  Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medication error are defined as follows:   
Overdose Accidental or intentional use of the study drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol-defined dose  
Misuse  Intentional and inappropriate use of study drug not in accordance with the  protocol  
Abuse Sporadic or persistent intentional excessive use of study drug accompanied by [CONTACT_763096]  E7080- G000- 207

Eisai  
FINAL:  [ADDRESS_1045665].   
All AEs associated with overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error  should be  captured  
on the Adverse Event CRF  and also  reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting 
of Serious Adverse Events (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  
Abuse is always to be captured as an AE.  If the AE associated with an overdose, misuse, 
abuse, or medication error does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF. 
REPORTING OF SIGNIFICANT LABORATORY ABNORMALITY  
Any significant treatment- emergent laboratory abnormality that  meets the criteria 
described below and is observed during the clinical study should be entered on the Advers e Event CRF and reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), even if the laboratory abnormality does not meet 
serious criteria.  If the significant laboratory abnormality does not meet serious criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF. 
A laboratory result should be considered a treatment- emergent significant abnormality if 
the result: 
• Is within normal limits at baseline and has increased in severity to meet the sponsor’s 
grading criteria for laboratory values of Grade 3 or above  
• Is outside normal limits at baseline and increases in severity to the sponsor’s grading criteria for laboratory values of Grade 4 or above.  These abnormalities are automatically considered to be serious, with the exception of expected and reproducible hematologic abnormalities.  
• Is otherwise considered by [CONTACT_403703]  [IP_ADDRESS] 
Significant laboratory abnormalities should not be listed as separate AEs or SAEs if they 
are considered to be part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE or SAE. 
REPORTING OF STUDY -SPECIFIC EVENTS  
Study- specific events  should be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using 
the procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), even if 
the study -specific event does not meet serious criteria.  If the event does not meet serious 
criteria, it must still be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.

A subject (or subject’s parent or guardian) may elect to discontinue study drug at any 
time for safety, medical, or personal reasons .  Subjects who choose to discontinue study 
drug prior to disease progressi on will be followed in the post -study treatment follow -up 
period and continue to undergo regularly scheduled disease assessment until documentation of disease progression or start of an alternative anticancer treatment.  All subje cts who discontinue study drug will be followed for overall survival and all post 
progression cancer treatments administered will be recorded.  Subjects may at any time withdraw consent for further study participation.  No further data will be collected on subjects once consent has been withdrawn.  All subjects who discontinue the study are to complete the study’s early discontinuation procedures indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9).   
The investigator will promptly explain to the subject (or subject’s parent or guardian) involved that the study will be discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary measures for the subje ct.  A subject who has 
ceased to  return for visits will be followed up by [CONTACT_2319], phone, or other means to gather 
information such as the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses o f signs and symptoms.   
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for  1 of these primary 
reasons: AE (s), lost  to follow -up, subject choice, progression of disease, withdrawal of 
consent, pregnancy, study terminated by [CONTACT_3211], or administrative/other.  In addition to

PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYS IS 
Primary Endpoint Analyses 
Cohort 1 ( Single -Agent Dose -Finding) 
Cohort [ADDRESS_1045683] of lenvatinib and to increase the 
flexibility by [CONTACT_763064], which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_763045], is not completed (Smith , et al., 1998; Cheung, 2009).  Using this TiTE- CRM design, an eligible subject 
can be included in the trial at any time, without waiting for the completion  of prior 
subjects  (Doussau, et al, 2012).  The model will be re -estimated considering all the 
toxicity observations currently available.  The subject will be treated at the best current estimate of the RD.  Individual subjects on long -term treatment may be treated at a dose 
below the dose recommended by [CONTACT_763100].  
The RD will be defined as the dose that has DLT rate closest to the targeted a 20% rate.  
Four experimental doses may  be investigated in Cohort 1:  Dose - 1 (9 mg/m
2), Dose 1 
(11 mg/m2), Dose 2 (14 mg/m2), and Dose 3 (17 mg/m2).  The starting dose will be Dose 
1. 
A one -parameter empi[INVESTIGATOR_763046]:  where F(d, α) is the estimated 
probability of DLT at dose -level d, p d is the prior probability of DLT at dose  level d, and

 The skeleton of initial guesses of toxicity probabilities {p 0d} is numerically calibrated 
using the approach of Lee  et al.  (2005 ) and Cheung  (2009)  and using the “getprior” 
function of R, ensuring good design operating characteristics.  Based on consultation with 
the clinicians, the delta (half of the width of the CI) defining the indifference interval was set at 0.06 (indifference interval: 0.14 to 0.26) and the  prior maximum tolerated dose  
(MTD
0) at Dose 2, (14 mg/m²) is likely to be the RD (same as in adults).  This yields a 
vector of pr ior probabilities {p 0k} equal to 0.03, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.33, for the doses 9 
mg/m2, 11 mg/m2, 14 mg/m2, and 17 mg/m2, respectively, that was found reasonable by 
[CONTACT_47656].  
A noninformative prior distribution Normal (0, 1.34) has been assigned for α  in the 
Bayesian computation.  The simulation study confirmed that the operating characteristics of the model defined 
with these parameters were reasonable, with more than 50% correct selection of the RD in [ADDRESS_1045684]  to the target  (ie, having a DLT rate closest to 20%) .  A least 2 subjects 
will be required to complete  4 week s of treatment in Cycle 1 or report a DLT during 
Cycle 1 (at the starting dose) before a subject can be treated at the next dose level (dose-escal ation).  It is further specified that dose levels cannot be skipped when escalating.  
The RD will be determined either when approximately [ADDRESS_1045685] been treated at the same dose .  Futility 
is defined as having <25%  probability that any of the doses is safe.  
Cohort 2 (Single -Agent Expansion)  
DTC and osteosarcoma groups will be evaluated separately.  
Cohort 2A:  DTC  
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR  for subjects with measurable disease and BOR for 
all subjects .  All ORR or BOR will be based on RECIST 1.1 assessed every 8 weeks.   
The analyses  will be descriptively performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  
Cohort 2B:  Osteosarcoma 
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS-[ADDRESS_1045686] 1.1.   
The null hypothesis that PFS -4 is ≤ 25% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis 
of a PFS -4 ≥45%, using the 1- sample exact test of a single proportion, at the [ADDRESS_1045687] binomial 80% and 95% 
CIs. This analysis will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.

 Cohort 3 (Combination Dose- Finding and Expansion)  
Cohort 3A: Osteosarcoma Combination Dose-Finding 
As in Cohort 1, t he DLT will be assessed to determine the RD of lenvatinib in  
combination with ifosfamide  plus etoposide.    DLTs occurring during Cycle 1 will be 
evaluated and the subjects will be assigned a dose based on the rules for dose escalation 
and de- escalation  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Phase: Cohort 3A).  
This dose of lenvatinib will be used to treat additional osteosarcoma subjects in Cohort 3B. 
Cohort 3B (Osteosarcoma Combination Expansion) 
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS-[ADDRESS_1045688] 1.1.   The null hypothesis that PFS -4 is ≤ 25% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis 
of a PFS -4 ≥50%, using the 1- sample exact test of a single proportion, at the [ADDRESS_1045689] binomial 80% and 95% 
CIs.  This analysis will b e performed on the lenvatinib -naïve subject in Safety Analysis 
Set, while subjects enrolled from Cohorts [ADDRESS_1045690] -limit 
estimates.  Median PFS and the cumulative probability of PFS at 4, and 12 months will 
be presented with 2- sided, 95% CIs when an adequate number of at risk subjects at those 
time points warrant the estimate.  The cumulative PFS  and TTP  probabilities  will be 
plotted over time  as appropriate. 
Secondary endpoints ORR, DCR, and CBRwill be calculated with exact binomial 95% 
CIs. 
The endpoint of OS will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier product -limit estimates.  
Median OS and the cumulative probability of OS  at 12 months will be presented with 2-
sided, 95% CIs when an adequate number of at risk subjects at those time points warrant 
the estimate.  
The above analyses will be based on the lenvatinib- naïve subjects in the Safety Analysis 
Set, while subjects enrolle d from Cohorts 1 and 2B will be summarized only as

group ( 12 subjects) and Cohort 2B:  osteosarcoma group (15 to 30 subjects).  
Cohort 2A:  DTC Group  
Approximately 12 subjects with evaluable or measurable disease are planned to be 
enrolled in Cohort 2A due to limited number of pediatric patients with DTC.  
Cohort 2B:  Osteosarcoma Group  
A minimum of 15 PFS-4 evaluable subjects will be assessed in cohort 2B.  The sample 
size estimates were based on Simon’s Optimal Two -Stage Design (Simon, 1989).  If 
fewer than [ADDRESS_1045693] 10 subjects who are alive and free of disease progression at 4 months are recorded among the 27 subjects in the cohort, study drug will be considered active in the population.

With the following assumptions:  p 0=25%, p 1=50%, 1-sided α=10%, β= 20%, where p 0 is 
an unacceptable rate of PFS, p 1 is the target rate of PFS, α is the probability of declaring 
lenvatinib effective when the true rate is p 0, and β is the probability of declaring

specifically affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the 
scientif ic quality of the study require submission to health or regulatory authorities as 
well as additional approval by [CONTACT_3239]/IECs.  These requirements should in 
no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by [CONTACT_093], or by [CONTACT_103], in the interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the study.  If 
the investigator determines that an immediate change to or deviation from the protocol is 
necessary for safety reasons to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subject s, the 
sponsor’s medical monitor and the IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately.  
The sponsor must notify the health or regulatory authority as required by  [CONTACT_13125]. Per [ADDRESS_1045701] only administrative aspects of the study may not require 
submission to health or regulatory authority or the IRB/IEC, but the health or regulatory 
authority and IRB/IEC  should be kept informed of such changes as required by [CONTACT_13125].  In these cases, the sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC 
and the Competent Authorities detailing such changes.

An updated version (4.03) is now in use as of [ADDRESS_1045709] been correlated 
with single -concept, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) terms.  
CTCAE v4.03 grading refers to the severity of the AE.  CTCAE grades 1 through 5, with 
unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, are based on this general guideline:  
Grade  CTCAE Status  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living (ADL).a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening:

Clinical Study Protocol  E7080- G000- 207 
incorporating Amendment 04   
 
 
Eisai  
FINAL:  [ADDRESS_1045712] biologic samples collected for 
pharmacodynamic (PD) , pharmacogenomic (PG) , and other biomarker  analysis.  The se 
samples may be used for discovery or validation to identify biomarkers that  may be used for 
exploratory evaluation of response and/or safety -related outcomes as well as for use in 
diagnostic development.  
The PG samples may be used to identify genetic factors that may influence a subject’s 
exposure to the study drug, as well as ge netic factors that may have an effect on clinical 
response or potential adverse events related to study treatment, and to explore the role of 
genetic variability in response.  Samples may be analyzed to determine a subject’s genotypes 
or sequence for a num ber of genes or non -coding regulatory regions.  The research may 
include the investigation of polymorphisms in genes that are likely to influence the study 
drug pharmacokinetics or therapeutic response.  
Collection of the PD, PG , and other biomarker  samples  will be bound by [CONTACT_763117].  Sample collection for PD, PG, 
and other biomarker analysis is required as per the study protocol unless the collection and 
use of the samples is prohi bited by [CONTACT_763118].  
Sample Collection and Handling 
The samples will be collected according to the study flow chart.  If, for operational or 
medical reasons, the genomic DNA  blood sample cannot be obtained at the prespecified visit, 
the sample can be taken at  any study center visit at the discretion of the investigator and site 
staff.  
Security of the Samples, Use of the Samples, Retention of the Samples  
Sample processing, for example DNA and/or RNA extraction, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], sequencing , or 
other analysis will be performed by a laboratory under the direction of the s ponsor.  
Processing, analysis, and storage will be performed at a secure laboratory facility to protect 
the validity of the data and maintain subject privacy.  
Samples will only be used for the purposes described in this protocol.  Laboratories 
contracted to perform the analysis on behalf of the s ponsor will not retain rights to the 
samples beyond those necessary to perform the specified analysis and will not transfer or sell 
those samples.  The s ponsor w ill not sell the samples to a third party.  
Samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the completion of the study (defined as 
submission of the clinical study report to the appropriate regulatory agencies).  At the end of 
the storage period, samples w ill be destroyed.  Samples may be stored longer if a health 
authority (or medicinal product approval agency) has active questions about the study.  In 
this special circumstance, the samples will be stored until the questions have been adequately 
addressed.

incorporating Amendment 04   
 
 
Eisai  
FINAL:  [ADDRESS_1045713] of future testing, all samples collected 
will be single or double  coded (according to the ICH  E15 guidelines) in order to maintain 
subject privacy.  
Right to Withdraw  
If, during the time the samples are stored, a participant would like to withdraw his/her 
consent for participation in this research, Eisai will destroy the samples.  Information from 
any assays that have already been completed at the time of withdrawal of consent will 
continue to be used as necessary to protect the integrity of the research project.  
Subject Privacy and Return of Data 
No subject -identifying information (eg, initials, date of birth, government identifying 
number) will be associated with the sample.  All PD and other biomarker samples will be 
single coded.  Genomic DNA samples used to explore the effects on PK, treatment response, 
and safety will be single coded .  Genomic DNA samples that will be stored for long -term use 
(defined as 15 years after the completion of the study) will be double coded.  Double  coding 
involves removing the initial code (subject ID) and replacing with another code such that the 
subject can be re- identified by [CONTACT_2363] [ADDRESS_1045714] 
access to the “key.”  Clinical data collected as part of the clinical trial will be cl eaned of 
subject identifying information and linked by [CONTACT_3256] “key.”  
The sponsor will take steps to ensure that data are protected accordingly and confidentiality 
is maintained as far as possible.  Data from subjects enrolled in this study may be analyzed 
worldwide, regardless of location of collection.  
The sponsor and its representatives and agents may share coded data with persons and 
organizations involved in the conduct or oversight of this research.  These include:  
• Clinical research org anizations retained by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor   
• Independent ethics committees or institutional review boards that have responsibility for 
this research study   
• National regulatory authorities or equivalent government agencies  
At the end of the analysis, results may be presented in a final report which can include part or 
all of the coded data, in listing or summary format.  Other publication (eg, in peer -reviewed 
scientific journals) or public presentation of the study results will only include summaries of 
the populati on in the study, and no identified individual results will be disclosed.

these results will not be disclosed to the patients or their physicians.  
If at any time, PD, PG , and/or other biomarker  results  are obtained that may have clini cal 
relevance, IRB review and approval will be sought to determine the most appropriate manner 
of disclosure and to determine whether or not validation in a Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments ( CLIA )-certified setting will be required.  Sharing of r esearch 
data with individual patients should only occur when data have been validated by [CONTACT_763119] -approved laboratories.

Version 10/05/201 8 Page 3 I. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS     
   More than 500,000 patients undergo coronary artery by[CONTACT_10956] (CABG)  each year in the United 
States.1 Nearly 30% to 40% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery have diabetes mellitus (DM).2,3 More than 
90% of patients with DM and ~80% of patients without DM will develop hyperglycemia (defined as a BG >140 
mg/dl) after surgery.4-[ADDRESS_1185571] reported that hyperglycemia;  in patients with and without DM , 
is an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery.8-[ADDRESS_1185572] higher 
rates of deep sternal wound infections,11,13 acute renal failure,6 longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408],9,14 and perioperative 
mortality14,15 when compared to those without DM. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_852617], 
there is strong agreement that improvement in glycemic control reduces complications and inpatient mortality .16-
18 In the GLUCO- CABG trial,19 we reported lower, but not significant differences in a composite of complications 
between intensive and conservative regimens in patients with DM; however, we observed a reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852618]- DM patients with stress hyperglycemia treated with intensive glucose control (see 
preliminary results).  
 
   Clinical guidelines from professional organizations recommend treatment with continuous intravenous insulin infusion (CII) for treatment of hyperglycemia in cardiac surgery patients with DM  and hyperglycemia.
7,20-22 
Although effective and widely utilized 16,18,23, the use of CII is labor intensive, requiring hourly BG testing and 
insulin drip adjustment, and is associated with a signifi cant risk of hypoglycemia, reported in 5 – 32% of patients 
in the ICU.24-27 Hypoglycemia after cardiac surgery has been independently asso ciated with increased risk of 
complications, longer length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and increased mortality.28-30 Recently, the inpatient therapy with 
dipeptidyl peptidase -4 [DPP -4] inhibitors has been shown to be  an effective alternative to insulin therapy in 
improving glycemic control with low risk of hypoglycemia.31 In addition, our preliminary studies indicate that 
the use of sitagliptin is  effective in maintaining  glucose control and in preventing the need for subcutaneous 
insulin therapy during the transition period from the ICU to regular floors in cardiac surgery patients with  stress 
hyperglycemia (see preliminary data).  
 
We hypothesize  that treatment with sitagliptin (Januvia®) , by [CONTACT_852643]- mediated hepatic glucose 
production and by [CONTACT_852644] a glucose -dependent fashion, will prove to be a safe and 
effective for the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia during the perioperative period in cardiac surgery patients  with type 2 diabetes .  
 
I.1.   Specific Aims  
 
Aim 1.  To determine whether treatment with sitagliptin  reduces the frequency and severity of 
hyperglycemia and  need for CII in the ICU compared to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes 
undergoing CABG  surgery.  In this prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled  study, patients with  
type 2  diabetes (T2D)  treated with diet , oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), and/or  insulin  will be randomized to 
receive sitagliptin or placebo starti ng the day prior to surgery and continue once daily in the ICU . 
Hypothesis: Treatment with sitagliptin will significantly reduce the severity of  hyper glycemia and the need for 
CII during the perioperative period in T2D patients undergoing CABG .  
 
Aim 2. T o determine whether treatment with sitagliptin  is effective in maintaining glycemic control and in 
preventing the need for subcutaneous (SC) insulin therapy  in patients with T2D  during the transition from 
ICU to telemetry unit in patients  with T2D undergoing CABG . In this study, patients randomized to sitagliptin 
or placebo in Aim 1 will continue treatment  after transition from ICU to  regular wards . 
Hypothesis: Treatment with sitagliptin will be effective in maintaining glucose control avoiding the need for SC 
insulin therapy after transition from ICU to regular wards in T2D undergoing CABG surgery.  
 
I.2. Overall Design and Study Interventions  
   This prospective, randomized, blinded pi[INVESTIGATOR_852619] T2D undergoing 
CABG surgery . Subjects will be consented prior to surgery at the surgery -anesthesia pre -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852620] .  Subjects will be randomized to receive sitagliptin or placebo starting 
one day prior to surgery and continued daily in the ICU (Aim 1) to determine if hype rglycemia  (BG > 1 80 mg/dl 
Version 10/05/201 8 Page 4 in the ICU) could be prevented or ameliorated with the use of a DPP4- inhibitor.  Treatment with sitagliptin or 
placebo (Aim 2) will be continued during transition to regular floors to confirm our preliminary data that treatment 
with DPP4 -inibitors facilitates the management of hyperglycemia avoiding the use of SC insulin after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852621]. Study patients who develop hyperglycemia during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (BG > 1 80 mg/dl  in non -
ICU areas) will be managed following our institution standard insulin protocols.  
 The dose of s tudy drug will depend on the patient’s GFR a t time of randomization. Patients with a calculated 
GFR≥50 mL/min/1.73m
2 will receive study drug 100mg daily. Patients with calculated GFR between 30- 49 
mL/min/1.73m2 will receive study drug 50mg daily. If the calculated GFR drops below  30 mL/min/1.73m2, 
patients will receive study drug 25mg daily. If the calculated GFR changes  after randomization, study drug will 
be adjusted accordingly.   
  
I.3. Background and Significance  
 
I.3.1. Diabetes and Coronary Heart Disease. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rising at an alarming rate 
and it currently affects ~[ADDRESS_1185573] a 2 - to 4-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction, 36,37 and 3 times as many 
deaths as people without diabetes.33,38   
 
I.3.2. Diabetes and CABG surgery. More than 500,000 patients undergo CABG surgery each year in the 
[LOCATION_002].1 The national prevalence of diabetes among patients undergoing CABG is about 30% .39-[ADDRESS_1185574] increased perioperative mortality and morbidity and more 
recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_165356].3,9,17,42. Similarly, long -term survival after surgical revascularization is significantly 
reduced in diabetics compared to nondiabetic subjects.43,44 In the BARI tri al, diabetics had significantly lower 5-
year survival rates (73.3% vs. 91.3%) than nondiabetic subjects.[ADDRESS_1185575] deaths after CABG are attributable to 
cardiac causes in ~ two -thirds of patients (ischemia due to graft failure, left ventricular failure and 
dysrhythmia),11,41,46,47 as well as increased neurologic complications,48 renal dysfunction,49 and infectious 
complications .11,50   
 
I.3.3. Glycemic control in cardiac surgery patients with T2D and Hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia during 
the perio perative period is reported in > 90% of patients with T2D and in ~80% of patients without a history of 
DM.4-[ADDRESS_1185576] identified hyperglycem ia, in patients with and without DM as an independent 
risk factor of poor outcome after cardiac surgery compared to patients with normoglycemia, specifically higher 
perioperative mortality,14,15 deep sternal wound infections ,11,13 renal f ailure,6 postoperative strokes,9,51 longer 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] s,9,14 and higher health c are resource utilization .52-54  
 
   The results of several clinical trials in critically ill and surgery patients indicate that improvement of glycemic 
control reduces length of stay ( LOS ), risk of multi -organ failure and systemic infections,13,16,[ADDRESS_1185577], a prospective, non-
randomized study of diabetic patients who underwent CABG13 reported that the use of CII to achieve a BG target 
between 150- 200 mg/dl com pared with SQ regular insulin resulted in a lower mortality rate (2.5% vs. 5.3%) and 
reduced rate of deep sternal wound infection by 66%.[ADDRESS_1185578] of intensive insulin 
therapy in diabetic and non- diabetic surgical ICU patients treated to target glucose between 80 and 110 mg/dl 
reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140864] 34%. A  subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_852645]57 of surgical and medical ICU 
patients reported  that while glucose lowering effectively reduced mortality in those without a previous history of 
diabetes, no significant benefit from treatment was observed in patients with diabetes. Similarly, in the GLUCO-
CABG trial (see preliminary results) we found a lower, but non- significant reduction in a composite of 
complications between intensive and conservative regimens in patients with DM; however, we observed a 
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852622].19  
 
Version 10/05/201 8 Page 5 1.3.4. Stress hyperglycemia: mechanisms and consequences.  The ADA/AACE and Endocrine Society 
guidelines on inpatient hyperglycemia defined hyperglycemia or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -related hyperglycemia as any BG 
concentration >140- 180 mg/dl. Acute illness, surgery, and trauma raise levels of counterregulatory hormones 
such as glucagon, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], cortisol, and growth hormone. The counterregulatory response results in a number 
of alterations in carbohydrate metabolism, including insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, impaired peripheral glucose utilization, and relative insulin deficiency.
58,59 The development of hyperglycemia 
leads to generation of reaction oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and elevated infl ammatory markers. It 
also increased pro -inflammatory cytokine such as tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α), interleukin (IL)- 6, and 
IL-1, which ultimately alter the immune system, 60-63 as well altered hemostasis, increased platelet activation, 
adhesion and aggregation,64 reduced plasma fibrinolytic activity and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 
(PAI -1) activity .65   
 
1.3.5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852623] -4 Inhibitors. We recently completed a randomized two -center open label  pi[INVESTIGATOR_852624] d the safety and efficacy of treatment with sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin in 
general medicine and surgery patients with T2D.31 In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 90 general medicine and surgery patients 
with a BG between 140 -400 mg/dl treated with diet, oral antidiabe tic drugs or low -dose insulin were ran domized 
to sitagliptin once daily, sitagliptin and basal insulin, or basal bolus insulin. All groups received correction doses of lispro before meals and bedtime for BG >140 mg/dl.  Patients in the sitagliptin group re ceived a single daily 
dose of 50- 100 mg based on kidney function. The use of sitagliptin alone or in combination with basal insulin 
was well tolerated and resulted in no significant differences in daily BG, frequency of hypoglycemia or in the number of tre atment failures compared to basal bolus regimen. DPP4 therapy is associated with low -risk of 
hypoglycemia, and these agents are ideal for the management of hyperglycemia and diabetes in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] .  In a different uncontrolled pi[INVESTIGATOR_852625] a group of 22 patients with stress hyperglycemia requiring 
insulin infusion in the ICU with sitagliptin. Patients were treated with sitagliptin 100 mg/day at discontinuation of CII (as an alternative to the SQ insulin) and at transition to regular floo r. The use of sitagliptin was well 
tolerated and patients remained in good metabolic control avoiding transition to SQ insulin after discontinuation of IV insulin drip (see preliminary results).    
 
1.3.6. Significance and Innovation.   
Significance.   Most cardiac surgery patients, with or without history of T2D, develop significant hyperglycemia 
and require CII  during the perioperative period.6,16,66 There is strong evidence to indicate that hyperglycemia is 
an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery.8-12 Clinical guidelines recommend 
treating patients with hyperglycemia with CII in the ICU ; 7,20,21 however;  CII is labor intensive, costly, and 
associated with a high rate of hypoglycemia (5–32%).24-[ADDRESS_1185579] 2 major innovative areas: 1) can hyperglycemia, which is present in more than 90% of patients with T2D after CABG  surgery, be prevented or ameliorated with the use of a DPP4-
inhibitors ? And 2) can DPP4 -inhibitors facilitate the management of patients with T2D  avoiding the use of 
subcutaneous basal bolus  insulin therapy during the transition from ICU to regular floors ? These are two important 
clinical questions that may facilitate care of millions of patients with T2D undergoing cardiac surgery. More importantly, if treatment with sitagliptin is  proven effective in reducing the severity of hyperglycemia during the 
perioperative period, and in reducing the rate of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia during the transi tion from ICU 
to regular wards, it is possible that these agents will reduce the number of perioperative complications in patients 
with T2D undergoing CABG surgery.       
Version 10/05/201 8 Page 6 2. PRELIMINARY RESULTS:  
Our research team has extensive clinical and research experie nce in inpatient management of hyperglycemia and 
has published several randomized controlled trials in medical/surgery patients in ICU and non- ICU settings.19,31,67-
71 Emory University and affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852626] a 
large population based in the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia. More than 1000 major CV s urgeries (CABG, 
aortic and valve surgery) procedures are performed every year at the 3 participating institutions (Emory 
University, Midtown Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852627]).   
 
2.1. RABBIT [ADDRESS_1185580] compared the efficacy and safety of a basal/bolus regimen to sliding scale insulin (SSI) in non -
ICU patien ts undergoing general surgery. Study outcomes 
included differences in daily BG levels and a composite of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449519], pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], acute renal failure, and bacteremia. A total of 211 patients were 
randomized to glargine once daily + glulisine before meals or to SSI given 4 times/day. The mean daily glucose concentration after the 1st day of basal bolus and SSI  was 
145±32 mg/dl and 172±47 mg/dl, respectively, p<0.01. There were reductions with basal bolus as compared with SSI in the composite outcome (24.3% and 8.6%, OR: 3.39 (95% CI: 1.50- 7.65); p=0.003). SSI had higher number 
of wound infection (2.9% vs. 10.3%), pneumonia (0% vs. 2.8%), and acute renal failure (3.8% vs. 10.3%) than basal bolus regimen. We concluded that treatment with basal bolus improved glycemic control and reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852628] T2D.   
 
2.2. Sitagliptin Inpatient Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116].31   In a two -center 
open label randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_852629] T2D.  In this study, 90 patients with a BG between 140 -400 mg/dl treated with diet, 
OAD or low -dose insulin (≤ 0.4 U/kg/day) were randomized 
to sitagliptin once daily (n=30), sitagliptin and basal insulin (n=30) or to a basal bolus (n=30) regimen. Patients in the sitagliptin grou p received a daily dose of 100 mg or 50 mg as 
per renal function. Those in the sitagliptin plus glargine received sitagliptin and glargine starting at 0.25 U/kg once daily. Patients in the basal bolus group were started at 0.5 U/kg, given half as glargine once daily and half as lispro before meals.  All groups received correction doses of lispro before meals and bedtime for BG >140 mg/dl.  We found that treatment with sitagliptin alone or in combination with glargine resulted in similar glycemic control com pared to basal bolus regimen (Figure 2). 
There were no differences in mean daily BG, number of BG readings within target, hypoglycemia, frequency of treatment failures, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800759].  In addition, treatment with sitagliptin had less daily insulin requirements and lower number of insulin injections, both, p<0.001. The study shows that use of a DPP4 inhibitor is a safe and effective for treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia. 
 
2.3. GLUCO -CABG TRIAL19 
This randomized controlled trial aimed to determine 
whether intensive BG control (intensive, target: 100 -140 
mg/dl) reduces perioperative complications compared to 

Version 10/05/201 8 Page 7 conservative BG control (conservative, 141- 180 mg/dl) in hyperglycemic patients undergoing CABG. After 
ICU care, subjects were transitioned to a single treatment regimen targeting a BG<140 mg/dl before meals 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334358] [ADDRESS_1185581] discha rge. The primary outcome was differences in a composite score 
of complications including mortality, wound infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], acute renal failure, and major cardiovascular events.  A total of 302 
patients were randomized to intensive (n=151) or conservative (n=151) glucose control following a computerized insulin infusion algorithm. The mean ICU daily BG was 132±14 mg/dl (IQR 124- 139) in the 
intensive and 154±20 mg/dl (IQR 142- 164) in the 
conservative group (p<0.001). Over all, we observed a 
similar number of patients in the intensive and conservative groups experiencing ≥ 1 complications (42% vs. 52%, p=0.08). There were no differences in 
the composite or on individual complications in patients with DM (Figure 3); however, the composite of complications was lower in non- DM patients with stress 
hyperglycemia (Fig 4 ) in the intensive compared to the conservative group (p=0.008). 
 
2.4. Sitagliptin after discontinuation of CII in patients with stress hyperglycemia.  
In an uncontrolled open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we treated a group of 22 non- DM patients with stress hyperglycemia in the 
ICU with sitagliptin 100 mg/day at discontinuation of CII (as an alternative to the standard SQ insulin) and at transition to regular floor  (Fig. 5). The use of sitagliptin was 
well tolerated and patients remained in good control with a 
mean daily BG < 140 mg/dl during days 1 and 4 after 
transition to regular floor. The sitagliptin therapy was discontinued the day before discharge and all patients were successfully discharged home without insulin injections. 
 
 
Transition of Care after Discharge.   In a recent preliminary 
study we assessed the efficacy of an HbA1c based algorithm for the management of 224 non- ICU patients with T2D (Fig. 
6). Patients with an admission HbA1c < 7% were discharged on their same o utpatient antidiabetic regimen (OADs and/or 
insulin).  Patients with an HbA1c between 7% and 9% will be discharged on a combination of OADs and basal (glargine) insulin at 50% of total daily hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124037]. Patients with an admission HbA1c ≥ 9% were dischar ged on a combination of 
oral agents and basal insulin at 80-100% of total daily hospi[INVESTIGATOR_275016] a basal bolus regimen at the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449534]. The admission HbA1c on admission of 8.75% decreased to 7.9% and 7.35% after 4 and 12 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190311] 
(p<0.01). We concluded that the admission HbA1c concentration is beneficial in designing the discharge treatment algorithm after discharge in patients with T2D.  
 
In summary , during the past decade our group has provided novel and important information to guide health care 
providers in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852630]. Our preliminary studies indicate that hyperglycemia is common and associated with increased rate of complications  in medicine and 
surgery pat ients with T2D .  The proposed studies will determine if DPP4 agents are effective in the prevention 
and management of hyperglycemia in patients with T2D undergoing CABG surgery.

3.  EXPERIMENTAL PLAN.  
 
3.1. Rationale: More than 90% of  patients with T2D undergoing cardiac surgery will develop hyperglycemia 
(BG>140 -180 mg/dl) and require treatment with CII during the perioperative period.6,7,16,66 There is strong 
evidence to indicate that hyperglycemia is an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality after cardiac 
surgery.8-12 Clinical guidelines recommend treatment with intravenous insulin infusion (CII)7,20,21, that is labor 
intensive, costly, and associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia24-27. The rate of severe hypoglycemia (BG 
< 40 mg/dl) in the ICU after cardiac surgery has ranged between 5% and 19% in p revious clinical trials.16,17,26,[ADDRESS_1185582] patients with T2D  who are treated with CII in the ICU require transition  to SC insulin (basal or basal bolus 
approach) when transferred to regular wards19,73. In such patients, daily insulin dose adjustment s are needed to 
prevent hypoglycemia once the stress abates 2 to 5 days a fter surgery. The basal bolus approach is labor intensive 
requiring multiple injections per day and is associated significant risk of hypoglycemia reported in 10% to 30% of patients in non- ICU setting.
68,71,74- 76 Hypoglycemia after cardiac surgery has been independently associated 
with increased ris k of complications and increased mortality.28-30 Our preliminary studies indicate that the use of 
sitagliptin is effective in achieving glucose control in patients with T2D,31 and in preventing the need for SC  
insulin therapy after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_852631]. 
 
3.2.  STUDY DESIGN  and METHODS  
   This randomized, placebo- controlle d, intent -to-treat trial  will include subjects between 18 -80 years of age, with 
a history of T2D undergoing CABG surgery. Patients with T2D treated with diet, oral antidiabetic drugs, will be 
randomized to receive sitagliptin or placebo (see, 3.2.a).  Due to the study design (i.e. need of  surgical care), there 
will be no run- in period.  Women in childbearing potential will have urine β- HCG measured to rule out 
pregnancy before participating in the study.   
 
 
3.2.a.  Treatment Groups: 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
3.2.b. Intervention:  
   A total of 2 20 patients  with T2D  will be consented and randomized prior to surgery. For patients consented in 
the outpatient setting  their antidiabetic treatment will be modified as follows: 
• Oral treatment:  Insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas and glinides), DPP-4 inhibitors will be 
discontinued 24 hours prior to surgery. SGLT -2 inhibitors  will be discontinued 48 hours prior to surgery. 
All other oral antidiabetic agents will be continued until the day prior to surgery. 
•  GLP -1 receptor agonists : short- acting  (liraglutide, exenatide) will be held 48 hours prior to surgery. 
Long- acting  (exenatide ER, albiglutide, dulaglutide) will be held at least one week before surgery. 
• Insulin:  Pre-prandial insulin will be continued until the day prior to surgery. Basal (glargine, detemir, 
degludec) and NPH insulin dose is recommended to be decreased by 20%, the day prior to surgery. 

Version 10/05/201 8 Page 9 Patients will receive sitagliptin or placebo starting the day before surgery and continue daily during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210].  The day of surgery, antidiabetic therapy will be held and subjects will receive study drug. The dose of 
study drug will depend on the patient’s GFR at time of randomization. Patients with a calculated GFR  ≥45 
mL/min/1.73m2 will receive study drug 100mg daily. Patients with calculated GFR between 30- 44 
mL/min/1.73m2 will receive study drug 50mg daily. If the calculated GFR drops below  30 mL/min/1.73m2, 
patients will receive study drug 25mg daily If the calculated GFR changes  after randomization , the study drug 
will be adjusted accordingly.   
 Recommendations to manage hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852632]:  
• Starting total daily insulin dose:  
• Insulin naïve patients (oral agents or no therapy)  
• Patients with BG between 140 -200 mg/dL= 0.3 units per kg weight per day.  
• Patients with BG between 201 -400 mg/dL= 0.4 units per kg weight per day. 
• The starting insulin TDD will be reduced to 0.25 units per kg in patients ≥ 70 years of age and/or 
with a GFR < 50 ml/min.  
• Subjects treated with insulin prior to admission will receive 80% of the outpatient dose (basal or basal plus prandial)  insulin dose. 
• Half of total daily dose will be given as basal ( glargine  or Levemir) and half as rapid -acting 
insulin analogs    
• Basal ( Glargine /Levemir) insulin will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.   
• Rapid -acting insulin (lispro , aspart or glulisine ) will be given in three equally divided doses 
before each meal.  To prevent hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, the dose will be held.  
• Insulin adjustment.  The total daily BASAL insulin dose will be adjusted as follow s:  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG between 100 -140 mg/dl without hypoglycemia the previous day: no 
change  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG between 1 41-180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 10% every day  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG >180 mg/dl: increase glargine dose by 20% every day  
• Fasting and pre -meal BG between 70 -99 mg/dl: decrease glargine dose by 10% every day 
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 20%.   
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <40 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 30- 40%.   
 
•  Supplemental insulin.   Supplemental (lispro ,aspart  or glulisine) insulin will be administered following 
the “sliding scale” protocol by [CONTACT_852646].    
• If a patient is able and expected to eat all or most of his/her meals, supplemental  insulin will be administered before each meal and at bedtime following the “usual” dose of the sliding scale protocol. 
• If a patient is not able to eat, supplemental insulin will be administered every 6 hours (6- 12-6-12) 
following the “sensitive” dose of the sliding scale chosen by [CONTACT_852647].  
If determined by [CONTACT_235117] -investigator that patie nt is insulin resistant, it would be to his/her 
medical discretion to adjust doses of basal  and rapid acting insulin based on patient’s needs.  
 
3.2.b.1   ICU Stay:   The study drug will be given once daily in a blinded fashion during the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70210]. Study patients with hyperglycemia  in the ICU  (defined as a BG >1 80 mg/dL) will continue to receive the 
study drug (sitagliptin or placebo) and will be started on intravenous CII in the ICU adjusted to achieve and 
maintain a  BG target between 1 10 - 180 mg/dl in the ICU .  
 
Patients  with hyperglycemia who require CII in the ICU will be started on the institution’s insulin infusion 
protocol in the ICU .  Below is the Emory insulin drip protocol : 
 
Version 10/05/201 8 Page 10  
3.2.b.2. Transition  from Insulin Drip to Subcutaneous Insulin  
The study drug will be given once daily in a blinded fashion until completion of 10 days of study treatment .  
• Patients who didn’t require CII or a rate <1 U/h:  
• Insulin naïve patients:  
o  BG <180 mg/dL: Transition to SSI  
o BG>180 mg/dL: Start basal weight based at 0.2 U/kg plus SSI.  
• Patients with prior insulin treatment:  
o Start basal at pre -surgery dose plus SSI, or  
o Start basal weight based at  0.2 U/kg plus SSI . 
 

Version 10/05/201 8 Page 11 • Patients that required continuous insulin infusion (CII) at a rate ≥ 1U/h will be transitioned to basal insulin 
(glargine/detemir).  Calculate total daily dose (TDD) of insulin from the average CII rate during the last four 
hours of infusion (example, if the average rate is 2 U/hr. , the TDD is 48 U/day)   
o Give 50% of calculated dose as basal (glargine/detemir) insulin every day.  Basal insulin will be 
given approx. 4 hours before discontinuation of CII. 
o Monitor BG AC and HS, if BG > 180 mg/dl x 2, start prandial (lispro / aspart) insulin at same 
basal dose divided in 3 equal doses before meals and coverage with sliding scale insulin for BG >180 mg/dl , see table 3.2.c.1. 
  
• After transition to regular floor, p atient s not transition ed to basal insulin  will continue to receive sitagliptin or 
placebo along with a supplemental sliding scale outlined in Table 3.2.c.1. During this period, if patients have 2 
consecutive fasting and/or premeal BG >180 mg/dl, or with average daily BG >180 mg/dl, 180 mg/dL), rescue 
therapy will be initiated.  Rescue therapy with subcutaneous insulin (see 3.2.c.2)  
 
 
 
 
Supplemental (correction) insulin.   Supplemental (lispro or aspart) insulin will be administered following the

Version 10/05/201 8 Page 12 3.2.c.2 Inpatient Rescue Therapy with Basal Bolus Insulin regimen:  
Patients with persistent hyperglycemia (fasting and premeal BG > 180 mg/dl) while receiving basal plus 
correction regimen will be changed to basal bolus insulin regimen, calculated to give 50% of basal (glargine  or 
detemir ) insulin once daily and 50% or premeal rapid- acting insulin (lispro or aspart) before meals.  
 
Basal Bolus Regimen: Starting total daily insulin dose:  
 
• Starting total daily insulin dose (TDD) = 0. 4 units per kg weight per day.  
• Half of total daily dose will be given as basal and half as rapid -acting insulin analogs   
• Basal  insulin will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.   
• Patien ts will receive the full -dose of basal  insulin (even if NPO).     
• Rapid -acting insulin (lispro, aspart) will be given in three equally divided doses before each meal.  To 
prevent hypogl ycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, the dose of lispro will be held.  
 
Insulin adjustment.  The total daily insulin dose will be adjusted as follow:  
• Fasting and /or pre-meal BG between 100 -180 mg/dl without hypoglycemia the previous day: no change  
• Fasting and /or pre-meal BG between >180 -240 mg/dl: increase basal  dose by 10% every day  
• Fasting and /or pre-meal BG >241 mg/dl: increase basal  dose by 20% every day  
• Fasting and /or pre-meal BG <100 mg/dl: Decrease basal by 10%  
•    If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL ), the insulin TDD (basal and prandial) should be 
decreased by 20%.   
 
Supplemental (correction) insulin.   Supplemental (lispro or aspart) insulin will be administered following the 
“sliding scale” protocol ( Table 3.2.c.1.).   
Blood glucose monitoring in non- ICU.  Blood glucose will be measured before each meal and at bedtime (or 
every 6 hours if a patient is not eating) using a glucose meter.  In addition, blood glucose will be measured at any time if a patie nt experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia or if requested by [CONTACT_1963].   
If determined by [CONTACT_235117] -investigator that patient is insulin resistant, it would be to his/her 
medical discretion to adjust doses of basal  and rapid acting insulin  based on patient’s needs.

that even if he/she consents to participate he/she may withdraw from the study at any time.  
5.3. Study Sites.  This study will be conducted at Emory Uni versity Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852638]  
 
6. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The proposal is a two -arm, three -center, randomized placebo- controlled clinical trial. The primary hypothesis is 
that treatment with sitagliptin will prove to be a safe and effective for the prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia during the perioperative period cardiac surgery patients.  
 
6. a. Analysis of Primary Endpoint: The pri mary endpoint s in this study are to  determine  differences 
between sitagliptin and placebo  treatment on: 1) frequency of hyperglycemia in the ICU after cardiac surgery , 
and 2)  number of patients with persistent hyperglycemia who require rescue therapy with SC insulin after 
discontinuation of CII . We will first use two -sided Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test to compare the primary 
endpoint  between the  treatment group and the control group. Next, we will perform multivariate logistic 
regression to estimat e the difference in the occurrence rate of the primary endpoint while adjusting for other 
relevant covariates such as age and gender.  Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model checking procedures, such as deviance residual plot and Hosmer -Lemeshow test, will be applied to examine the fit of the 
developed predictive model. W e will use two -sample t -tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests to  compare them 
between the two study groups. Transformations will be applied if normality violation is detected.  Multivariate linear regression will be further conducted to assess the difference in continuous secondary outcomes between the two groups while  accounting for other potential confounders. We will also apply standard model selection 
and diagnostic procedures to determine and assess the final multivariate linear model.  
 6. b. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  The secondary outcomes of interest can be a binary outcome (e.g. 
indicator for whether CII is needed in ICU), or a count outcome (e.g. number of perioperative complications), or a continuous outcome (e.g. mean daily BG concentration). We will adopt the sam e strategy proposed for the 
primary endpoint to analyze any binary or continuous secondary outcomes. For secondary endpoints measured as counts, we plan to use nonparametric tests such as Krustal -Wallis tests to compare them between the two 
study groups. U nivariate Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial  regression) will be performed to estimate 
the marginal treatment effect. In addition, we will also conduct multivariate Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial regression) to assess the outcome differences between the two study groups with potential confounders taken into account. We will use standard model selection and model checking procedures for Poisson regression (or Negative Binomial regression) and linear regression to decide the final models and assess 
their fits to the data.  
 
6. c. Sample Size Calculation and Power Analysis:  We have performed sample size and power calculations 
based on our prior studies. In the GLUCO -CABG trial, 91% of DM subjects had stress hyperglycemia in ICU . 
In this study, we  assume the same rate of hyperglycemia in the control (placebo) group. We anticipate that 
sitagliptin will reduce the  rate of hyperglycemia by 20- 25% (corresponding to odds ratio (OR) in the range of 
0.264- 0.213). We calculate the sample size based on the OR estimate of 0.264 and provide the power for the 
larger treatment effects represented by [CONTACT_186330]=0. 25, 0.20, and 0.15 (see Table). More specifically, conservatively 
using two- sided Fisher’s exact test, two -sided, with alpha=0.05, the sample size required for 80%  power to 
detect the conjectured treatment effect of OR=0.264 ( i.e. 91% vs 73%) would be 77 patients pe r study group. 
Accounting for 15- 20%% attrition rate, recruiting ~95  patients we need to be recruited in each group.  A total of 
200 randomized patients (100 patients per group) will be recruited in this study. 
 
We also consider the statistical power for the primary endpoint  for Aim  2 and important secondary endpoints. 
Based on the GLUCO -CABG trial, 98% of T2D  subjects required SQ insulin post -transition. We a ssum e the 
same rate for the placebo group in the proposed study, and expect 20- 25% reduction in the rate of requirin g SC  
insulin post -transition, which corresponds to OR in the range of 0.074- 0.057. G iven 77 patients per group (after 
attrition), we would have 97.8%  power when the OR in this endpoint is 0.074. . We also calculate the power for 
Version 10/05/201 8 Page 17 OR=0. 07, 0. 06, and 0.05 (Table) . In in the GLUCO -CABG data, the standard deviation (SD) of mean daily BG 
for T2D  subje cts is bounded above by 36 mg/dl. Assuming the same upper bound for the BG SD in this study, 
given 77 patients per group (after attrition), we would have over 80% power to detect a mean daily BG 
difference of 16.6 mg/dl between the two study groups, based on a two- sample, two- sided t -test, with 
alpha=0.05. Our calculations suggest that the proposed study is well powered for the primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints of major interests.   
 
 Table. Power computed based on two- sided Fisher’s exact test with alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1185586] (DSMB):  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review unblended data on safety, treatment compliance, and evaluate the efficacy of the intervention being studied in this clinical trial. The DSMB will meet at 6- month  
intervals and report on study progress to the IRB.  
8. Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] :  We plan to perform one interim analysis on the primary 
endpoint every [ADDRESS_1185587] been randomized.  The trial will be stopped if t here 
is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a difference in the rate of death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77085] (two- sided 
alpha level, <0.01) between the treatment groups.  
 9.       ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical o ccurrence or worsening of a preexisting 
medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this tr eatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:  
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  
Not related: There is n ot a reasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and the AE.  
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific 
occurrence of one or more AEs.)  Effect Size :

Version 10/05/201 8 Page 18 9.1. Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE below)  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life- threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion [e.g. medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes 
listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscras ias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g. pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE.  
NOTE:  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
− a visit to the emerg ency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not result in admission 
(unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
− elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
− admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surg ical procedure  
− routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., routine 
colonoscopy)  
− medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study. 
Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
− admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family 
circumstances, admi nistrative reason).

The collection of AEs will start after the signing of the informed consent.  A ll SAEs, whether related or not related 
to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be as sociated with protocol -specified procedures. An 
SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the conditions of 
the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure ), the relationship should 
be specified in the na rrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or designee) within [ADDRESS_1185588] be recorded on an SAE Report Form or similar form (e.g. CIOMS, MedWatch); If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports should 
include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes available, 
a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or designee) u sing the same procedure used 
for transmitting the initial SAE report.   
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
Version 10/05/[ADDRESS_1185589] be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of the CRF.  
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be r equested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are 
reported/identified during the course of the study.  
9.4. Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered 
both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be reported as an SAE.  
 
9. Risk associated with participation: 
9.1. Hypoglycemia.    Hypoglycemia is the main adverse event and safety issue in the study. In our previous 
ICU studies, we observed that <10% of cardiac surgery subjects during CII and 20- 30% during SC insulin 
experienced hypoglycemia . The use of insulin in combination with DPP4 inhibitors  may increase the risk of 
hypoglycemia during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  The number of mild (BG ≤70 mg/dL) and severe hypoglycemia (BG ≤ 40 mg/dL) and clinical consequences (neurological and cardiovascular) will be compared across treatment arms.    
9.2. Treatment of hypoglycemia.  Hypoglycemia, defined as a BG <70 mg/dL will be treated by a  standard 
hypoglycemia protocol available at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  In brief, insulin infusion will be turn off in the ICU or total 
daily dose of SC insulin will be reduced by 20- 40% in non- ICU settings. In the ICU, s ubjects will receive 
Dextrose 50% solution (D
50W) IV push based on the formula cc of D 50W IV push = (100- BG) x 0.4, or 
alternative D 50W IV push dose:  patient awake:  25 ml (1/2 amp), patient not awake (i.e. sedated):  50ml (1 
amp).  Blood glucose will be rechecked every 20 minutes and repeat 25ml of D 50W IV if < 60 mg/dL. Insulin 
infusion will be restarted once blood glucose is >140 mg/dL.  In non- ICU patients will be treated with oral 
glucose if alert or with IV Dextrose (as above) if comatose.  
 
9.3. Hyperglycemia.    It is possible that following the  proposed protocol, patients randomized to the 
conventional treatment arm will develop higher numbers of hyperglycemic events (BG >200 mg/dl) which may 
lead to increased risk of complications.  We expect that ~20% of subjects will experience one or more ep isodes 
of hyperglycemia.  The frequency of severe hyperglycemia will be analyzed statistically.   
 
9.4. Protection against risks.   Our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry will help to minimize 
risks. In addition, we will carefully monitor capi[INVESTIGATOR_852639], b) 
only experienced nurses/or phlebotomist will draw blood samples, and c) patients will be closely monitored in the ICU, d) no patients with history of significant pancreatic, renal or hepatic failure will be recruited in this study, e) study subjects will receive rescue therapy with insulin in the event of hyperglycemia.     
 
10. Potential benefits to the subject.  We believe that all subjects will benefit from this study.  
Intensified blood glucose monitoring and blood glucose control has been shown to significantly reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289718].   
 
11. Inclusion of women.   We anticipate that ~50% of the study subjects will be female.  No patients under 
the age of [ADDRESS_1185590] Caucasians.   
 
Version 10/05/[ADDRESS_1185591]. After the study is c ompleted, all data will be kept in a locked file. Presentation of the study results at regional or 
scientific meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.   
 
15. Payment for participation.     Participation in this study is voluntary.  Patients w ill receive one 
hundred dollars ($100.00) prior to discharge.  If a participant should stop participation before completion, the payment will be prorated at $20.[ADDRESS_1185592] policies . 
 
17. Study time line: More than 1200 major cardiac surgeries are performed every year at Emory University 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Midtown Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_852640].  We anticipate that > 80% of patients without a 
history of DM will experience stress hyperglycemia (BG>140 mg/dl) after surgery, giving 4 to 6 potential 
candidates per week.  Historically we averaged 8-12 subjects/week requiring insulin infusion 
at the 3 institutions.  We anticipate recruiting 2 or 3 patients per week (one per institution) for a total recruitment period of approximately [ADDRESS_1185593] all research sites, through letters or telephone calls. These monitoring contacts will include but not be limited to review of the following aspects: patient informed consent, patient recruitment and follow -up, SAE documentation and reporting, 
AEs with pre -specified monitoring documentation and reporting, AE documentation, patient compliance, 
concomitant therapy use and quality of data.

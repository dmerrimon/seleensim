 INTRODUCTION  
It is estimated that in the [LOCATION_002] there are approxi mately [ADDRESS_548853] moderate to seve re chronic kidney disease (CKD) 1. Among them , hypertension is 
common and is often poorly controlled due to an expanded volume state; diuretics are 
frequently prescribed. Loop diuretics are potent and effective in lowering blood pressure (BP ), 
however,  their use is associated with acute kidney injury. Thiazide diuretics, on the other hand, 
are less potent  and their use may be associated with less acute kidney injury . As of yet there is 
no firm data to support that thiazide diuretic therapy can improve BP in advanced CKD. In a review that we recently published, we found 13 studies on the use of thiazide diuretics in advanced CKD either alone or in combination with loop diuretics 
2. Of these, 9 studies were 
observational  and only 4 were randomized clinical trials. Our review suggests that thiazides may 
be useful even among people with advanced CKD. Observational data show that thiazides lead to an improvement in seated clinic BP of  about 10- 15 mmHg systolic and 5- 10 mmHg diastolic 
whereas randomized trials show about a 15- mmHg  reduction in mean arterial pressure.  
Randomized trials had small sample sizes (7- 23 subjects); accordingly, better studies are 
needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of thiazide diuretics in moderate to advanced CKD.  
We choose chlorthalidone because it is three  times more potent as a diuretic compared t o 
hydrochlorothiazide,  but it is about a tenth of the price of metolazone. Our preliminary studies 
that support its use in advanced CKD  is further explained later in the protocol .  
Our study  focus ed on the potential mechanisms by [CONTACT_433172]. These effects have not been evaluated so far. This randomized 
controlled trial, addresses a simple, inexpensive, yet an effective way to treating people with 
CKD who have poorly controlled hypertension. We use state- of-the-art methods such as body 
volume measurements (BodPod) and ambulatory BP monitoring for evaluations.   
 
OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS  
Objectives  
Primary Objective  
To test the hypothesi s that CTD will improve BP, we  will perform a double- blind,  
placebo- controlled, randomized trial among subjects with CKD and poorly controlled 
hypertension. After a two -week, si ngle- blind placebo run -in, we will randomize 160 hypertensive 
patients  confirmed by 24h ambulatory BP monitoring to either placebo or 12.5 mg CTD once 
daily.  We will monitor BP at home twice daily for one week before each of  their 4 weekly visits 
and titr ate the dose of the drug based on the home BP. We will double the dose of the diuretic 
(up to a maximum CTD dose of 50 mg/d) or placebo every 4 weeks if home BP remains 
≥135/85 mmHg (which is ~140/90 mmHg in the clinic). The primary endpoint  will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_433173] 12 weeks in 24h ambulatory systolic BP.   
 
6 | Final P rotocol  
 Secondary Objective  
To test the hypothesis that CTD will result in target organ protection, we will evaluate 
changes in albuminuria. Albuminuria will be assessed using overnight urine collections at 
baseline and every [ADDRESS_548854] the hypothesis that CTD causes improvement in BP via a reduction in 
extracellular fluid volume, we will evaluate changes from baseline in the following extracellular 
fluid volume markers:  N-terminal pro  B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) , seated plasma 
renin, and plasma aldosterone. We will use the gold- standard for measuring body volume which 
is air displacement plethysmography. We predict that CTD use will be associated with loss of 
fluid weight and therefore a change in body volume. Our preliminary data show changes in each 
of these markers within 4 weeks.  
Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that among subjects  with advanced CKD,  chlorthalidone (CTD) will 
result in improved 24 -hour ambulatory BP . Furthermore, CTD will improve albuminuria over 12 
weeks providing evidence for target organ protection. CTD will produce these effects by [CONTACT_433174] ( Figure 1 ).

 BACKGROUND  
The burden of CKD is high; hypertension is common in CKD  
It is estimated that in the [LOCATION_002] approximately 7.7% of the population has 
moderate (Stage 3) and 0.35% severe (Stage 4) chronic kidney disease (CKD) 3. The 
prevalence of hypertension in CKD is high. For example, a survey of >10,000 individuals at high 
risk for kidney disease screened in every state in the [LOCATION_002], revealed that 86% of the subjects had hypertension and 70% were treated. The control of hypertension to recommended levels was dismal; adequate control was present in only 13% 
4. In the US adult population the 
prevalence of hypertension is 31%; 70% are treated and 46% are controlled 5. Although BP was 
controlled to <130/80 mmHg in 48% of those with hypertension but without CKD, among those with CKD and hypertension,  the control rat e was only 31% 
6. Thus, compared to those without 
CKD, among people with CKD , hypertension is more prevalent  and more often treated but less 
often controlled.  
Dietary excess of sodium (Na) is an important cause of hypertension 
Increased dietary Na intake in modern societies is an important and treatable cause of 
hypertension. A meta- analysis combining results of 50 studies shows that 78 mmol/d (1.8 g) 
reduction of dietary Na is associated with a reduction in BP among hypertensiv e people of 
5.0/2.7 mmHg 7; among non- hypertensives, BP is reduced by 2.0/1.0 mmHg 7. The Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) randomized controlled trial [ADDRESS_548855] Na intake (150 mEq /d), BP was reduced 2.1 mmHg systolic with moderate Na 
restriction (100 mEq/d). Compared to the highest Na intake, BP was reduced 6.7 mmHg systolic with greater (65 mEq/d) Na restriction. The greatest reductions in BP were seen among blacks, 
women, and those with hypertension.  
To lower the incidence of hypertension, the Institute of Medicine has recommended that 
dietary Na should be restricted to <1500 mg/d (65 mmol/d) 
9. However, recent estimates (2005-
2006) suggest that the average man in the US consumed 4 g Na; the average woman 2.8 g/d 10.  
Dietary Na restriction is also recommended as an initial step to treat pre -hypertension and stage 
I hypertension. Data is  now emerging that even people with later stage hypertension including 
those being treated with multiple antihypertensive agents such as those with resistant 
hypertension can benefit with this strategy 11. Although dietary Na restriction is important in 
controlling hypertension, in our salt -rich society, long- term adherence to this life- style change is 
challenging.   
Na overload and extracellular volume expansion is common in CKD and leads to hypertension  
Progressive loss of renal function leads to both a reduction in glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) and tubular mass. Reduced GFR results in reduced filtered Na load and volume 
expansion. Volume expansion provokes reduced renal tubular Na absorption,  but failure to fully 
suppress Na reabsorption increases extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. In some CKD states , such 
as the nephrotic syndrome,  an increase in tubular Na reabsorption may be the primary 
8 | Final P rotocol  
 abnormality causing ECF excess. Indeed, epi[INVESTIGATOR_433152] 12-14.   
Among patients with end -stage renal disease, both dietary and dialys ate Na restriction 
are the cornerstones for treating resistant hypertension 15. More important, volume reduction 
through ultrafiltration in patients consuming recommended intake of Na is an effective way to 
lower BP. Since these patients are treated with multiple drugs, this is an effective strategy of controlling poorly controlled hypertension. The volume control strategy has been tested in one 
randomized controlled trial 
16. In the Dry -weight Reduction In hypertensive hemodialysis 
Patients (DRIP) trial we randomized 150 patients in 2:1 ratio to either aggressive volume 
reduction or a control group 16. Within 4 weeks, BP reduction assessed by [CONTACT_433175] 7/3 mmHg was achieved; this effect persisted through the [ADDRESS_548856].  
Recommendations of the Guidelines on the u se of diuretics in CKD  
For the treatment of hypertension in CKD, the Seventh Report of the Joint National 
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 
7) recommends that those with advanced renal disease (estim ated GFR <30 ml/min 1.73 m2), 
should increas e doses of loop diuretics and be used in combination with other drug classes 17 . 
The JNC 8 has no statement in this group of patients.  
According to the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quali ty 
Initiative (KDOQI) diuretics should be used to treat hypertension in most patients with CKD 18.  
For those with estimated GFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 thiazide diuretics given once daily are 
recommended. However, loop diuretics are recommended for those with estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_548857] an evidence level of A.  
The Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment (CARI) guidelines 19 and the [LOCATION_006] 
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines20 are silent on the role of 
thiazides in CKD. The Canadian Hypertension Education Program states that for patients with 
non-diabetic CKD, thiazide diuretics are recommended as additive antihypertensive therapy 
(Grade D) 21. For patients with CKD and volume overload, loop diuretics are an alternative 
(Grade D). The Veterans Administration Department of Defense guidelines state that among those with CKD a diuretic should be used when a second BP medication is needed, or if hyperkalemia occurs 
22. Thiazide diuretics may be used if estimated GFR > 30 ml/min/1.73m2, 
but loop diuretics are usually needed for patients with lower estimated GFR.  
Taken t ogether, the guidelines do not strongly support the use of thiazide diuretics in 
advanced CKD. This is because the evidence base to support this recommendation is weak.  
9 | Final P rotocol  
 Small studies in CKD suggest that thiazide diuretics can cause natriuresis and BP 
lower ing 
We found [ADDRESS_548858] study reported in 1972 was conducted in 14 participants with advanced CKD (creatinine clearance (Ccr) 1.2 to 12 mL/min); metolazone was administered in doses ranging from 20- 150 mg per day (equivalent to about 200 mg to 1500 mg 
HCTZ). 
24   Urine Na excretion increased >2 times.     
2. Bennett et al reported a study in 20 participants with CKD (Ccr 4- 48 mL/min) 25. Over 
3 months of the study the dose of metolazone was titrated from 5 mg to 25 mg 
depending on response. Weight fell by 1.4 kg and diastolic BP fell by 12.5± 11.7 
mmHg among the 12 hypertensive participants Hypokalemia, AKI, and an increase in 
fasting blood glucose were the major complications noted.  
3. Craswell et al reported 12 participants with CKD, and all but one had Ccr of <60 
mL/min 26.  Oral metolazone was given in variable doses for durations lasting from 2-
20 weeks. Weight was reduced 1.4 kg, edema improved, and BP fell by 14.2/3.2 
mmHg from a baseline of 147/[ADDRESS_548859] participants (67%) requir ed potassium 
supplementation, AKI was noted, and uric acid increased despi[INVESTIGATOR_433153].  
4. Dargie et al reported 11 participants with nephrotic syndrome and 6 with CKD (GFR was between 1 -7 mL/min) treated with metolazone in dos es of 5- [ADDRESS_548860] 3.8 kg weight. Changes in BP 
were not reported.  
5. Paton et al reported a study in 10 participants with CKD and 10 participants with nephrotic syndrome 
28. Among 10 participants with CKD, BP improved from 173/96 
mmHg at baseline to 158/88 mmHg with metolazone (mean dose 11.0 mg over 56.6 
weeks).  Among 10 participants with nephrotic syndrome, BP improved from 147/97 
mmHg to 137/88 mmHg with metolazone (mean dose 14.9 mg, 114.4 weeks).  
6. Wollam et al studied 8 participants with mean serum creatinine 3.31 mg/dL and 
performed an interventional before -and-after study 29.  Increasing the dose of 
furosemide to between 320 and 480 mg/day had only a modest additional diuretic 
effect; plasma volume and arterial pressure were not significantly changed. Adding HCTZ, 25 to 50 mg twice a day, produced a marked diuresis, and a significant reduction in weight, plasma volume and mean arterial pressure. Three of the 8 
participants were treated with combined HCTZ- furosemide therapy.  These 
participants had an inadequate response to either diuretic alone but had 34/[ADDRESS_548861] that the 
10 | Final P rotocol  
 combination of a loop diuretic with a thiazide may reduce plasma volume and BP 
even in advanced CKD.  
7. Additionally, thiazides (HCTZ 50 mg daily or metolazone 5 mg daily or placebo in 4 
week periods in a cross -over study lasting 6 months) have been used among dialysis 
participants making <[ADDRESS_548862] of fixed dose CTD 25 mg QD among people with estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and poorly controlled hypertension to those 
with eGFR >60 (n=60) 
31. At 8 weeks, office systolic BP and body weight were both 
significantly reduced fro m baseline by 19 mmHg and 0.88 kg respectively. 
Importantly, both the subgroups of 28 subjects with eGFR 30- 44 and 9 subjects with 
eGFR 15 -29 had similar reductions in systolic BP at 19 and 20 mmHg respectively. 
BP reductions were similar in those with eGFR >60. Laboratory abnormalities and adverse events occurred in 15% of patients; these included hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hyperuricemia.  
9. The last study is ours and is discussed in preliminary data.  
Randomized controlled trials on the of use of thiazides in CKD  
Literature search revealed only 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the 
response to thiazides among participants with CKD. All were small; the largest being of [ADDRESS_548863] in 10 participants with 
advanced CKD; natriuresis was the end -point 
32. Inulin clearance averaged 13.1 
mL/min/1.73 m2.  After  a low Na diet (150 mmol/d) a sham infusion of 50 ml 5% 
dextrose was given on Day 6 and Day 13. On the days following the sham infusion (days 7 and 14), participants received either torsemide 50 mg IV alone or torsemide 
50 mg in combination with butizid 20  mg IV (equal to ~30 mg of HCTZ) in a cross -
over fashion.  With torsemide alone, Na excretion rate increased from 154 mEq/d to 
232 mEq/d. With torsemide + thiazide, Na excretion rate increased significantly more 
from 156 mEq/d to 290 mEq/d.  
2. Knauf and Muts chler performed a single- blind RCT (n=19) of loop diuretic or a 
combination of loop diuretic plus a thiazide in participants with moderately severe 
renal failure (Ccr 39.5 mL/min) 
33. After establishment of a steady state of urinary 
electrolyte excretion, a single oral dose of HCTZ (25 mg) induced an increase in the 
urinary excretion of Na, K, Cl, Ca, and Mg over the subsequent [ADDRESS_548864], when the lower doses of each (25 mg HCTZ + 40 mg 
furosem ide) were co- administered, there was a substantial and a statistically 
significant increase in Na excretion. Thus, a combination of low doses of diuretics 
acting at different functional sites of electrolyte reabsorption in the nephron may be superior in natriuretic potency to increasing the dose of either diuretic alone.  
11 | Final P rotocol  
 3. Dussol et al, reported the first double -blind, RCT of furosemide and HCTZ in 2005 
(n=7, Ccr <40 mL/min) 34. Long -acting furosemide (60 mg/d) or HCTZ (25 mg/d) was 
given in a cross over manner for [ADDRESS_548865] of thiazides on vasculature and peripheral vascular resistance. None of  the 
above studies, even when considered collectively, provide enough support to firmly recommend 
the routine use of these drugs in advanced CKD.   
Risks and benefits of thiazides in CKD  
There are several problems that may be associated with thiazide use i n CKD. These 
include volume depletion, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, 
hyperglycemia, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and idiosyncratic  events ( e.g., rash, pancreatitis etc. ). Like with 
other BP lowering agents, transient creatinine elevation and o rthostatic hypotension may be 
seen. Thus, the use of these agents requires close monitoring,  especially when initially 
prescribed or when their dose is increased. These risks can be assessed only in larger and 
longer studies.  
Thiazides may augment the natr iuretic effect of loop diuretics and in doing so may 
improve the control of BP. This may be especially true among individuals who may have been 
on diuretics for a long time and consequently developed a hypertrophied distal nephron. By [CONTACT_30212] K excretion, thiazides may be valuable in the setting of hyperkalemia such as people with diabetic nephropathy and Type IV renal tubular acidosis.  
Preferred thiazide diuretic  use in CKD  
There are important differences between thiazide diuretics in potency, duration of action, 
side effects, and costs. In a recent meta- analysis of trials comparing the antihypertensive effects 
of thiazides among patients with hypertension, Peterzan et al reported markedly different potencies of hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone (CTD),  and Bendroflumethiazide 
36. Potency 
followed a log- linear relationship Bendroflumethiazide > CTD > HCTZ. The estimated dose of 
each drug predicted to reduce systolic BP by 10 mm Hg was 1.4, 8.6, and 26.4 mg, respectively. Thus, CTD has nearly three times the pot ency compared to the commonly used 
12 | Final P rotocol  
 HCTZ. However, at ceiling doses of different thiazides, the maximum reduction in systolic BP 
was similar. Given the higher potency, a longer duration of action, and a lower cost, CTD may 
be preferred to other thiazides. I n studies that have compared ambulatory BP with HCTZ or 
CTD, the latter appears to provide a more consistent reduction in 24- hour BP i.e., both during 
the day and during the night. For example, in a cross -over study of 30 participants, of which 24 
completed 8 weeks of treatment with both agents, 50 mg HCTZ produced 7.4 mmHg reduction in 24- hour systolic BP , whereas 25 mg CTD produced 12.4 mmHg decline (p=0.054) 
37. More 
significant were the differences i n nighttime  BP; 50 mg HCTZ produced a 6.4 mmHg reduction 
whereas 25 mg CTD produced 13.5 mmHg reduction (p=0.009). Reductions in clinic BP were 
similar between agents. Post -hoc analysis of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial suggests 
that compared to HCTZ, CTD may more effectively cause regression of left ventricular 
hypertrophy [ADDRESS_548866] the kidney  
In a cross -sectional study, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke 
(REGARDS) Study , the interactive relationship between dietary Na and body mass index on 
albuminuria was evaluated 40. In 30,239 adults aged ≥45 years  and among obese participants, a 
higher dietary Na intake or a higher urinary Na/K ratio was associated with albuminuria. Among 3,680 participants in the Chronic Renal Insuf ficiency Cohort study, the relationship between 24-
hour urinary sodium  or potassium on 24 -hour urine protein excretion was examined 
41. Urinary 
sodium  excretion was associated with increasing proteinuria even after and adjustment for 
demographic and clinical factors , including 24 -hour urinary potassium.  
A high dietary salt intake may accelerate the progression of CKD independent of 
angiotensin II and s ystemic blood pressure. A high dietary salt intake activates the vascular 
endothelium and provokes the release of transforming growth factor -beta1 (TGF -β1) 42. 
Additionally, a high dietary salt intake provokes nitric oxide production, which attenuates TGF-
β1. In this model, the overproduction of TGF- β1 permits excess biological activity of this 
important fibrogenic growth factor with subsequent development or acceleration of va scular and 
kidney damage. In patients with diseases whose pathogenesis is related to excess production of 
TGF-β1, such as chronic allograft nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy, increased salt intake 
may hasten loss of function, particularly if nitric oxide production does not increase.  
The effects of modest salt restriction on BP and urine protein excretion in nondiabetic 
black hypertensive participants were examined in a randomized, double blind, and placebo-
controlled, cross -over study 43. After the run-in period,  on their usual diet and on reduced salt, 
participants continued to rest rict their salt intake and then received either “slow Na” tablets, 
designed to bring their salt intake back to normal, or placebo tablets for 4 weeks. In the 40 who 
completed the study, switching “slow Na” to placebo caused urinary Na excretion to fall from 
169 to 89 mmol/d. BP fell from 159/101 to 151/98 mm Hg (P<0.01). Protein excretion fell from 
13 | Final P rotocol  
 93 mg to 75 mg per 24 hours (P<0.008). Therefore , reducing salt intake from approximately 10 
to 5 g per day reduced both BP and urine protein excretion among black hypertensives. 
Furthermore, t his reduction in urine protein was seen within a few weeks.  
Vogt et al performed a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial to determine 
the separate and combined effects of a low -Na diet and hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ) on 
proteinuria and BP 44. In 34 proteinuric patients , without diabetes, mean baseline proteinuria 
was 3.8 g/d, and this was reduced by 22% with  a low -Na diet alone. Losartan monotherapy 
reduced proteinuria by 30%, and the addition of a low -Na diet led to a total reduction by 55% 
and the addition of HCTZ to 56%. The combined addition of HCTZ and a low -Na diet reduced  
proteinuria by 70% from baseline (all P < 0.05). The reduction in urine protein was seen within a few weeks. Reductions in mean arterial pressure showed a similar pattern (all P < 0.05).  
Thus, the benefits of reducing dietary Na intake, diuretics, or bot h may extend to 
protecting the kidney, above and beyond reducing BP.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_433154] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], open- label study of CTD 
64. To 
test the hy pothesis that CTD effectively lowers BP in moderate to advanced CKD after 
confirming poorly controlled hypertension with 24- hour ambulatory BP monitoring in 14 men 
(age 67.5 y, diabetes mellitus in 12, median number of antihypertensive drugs 4), with stage 3B 
(n=4) or 4 CKD (n=10) (eGFR 26.8 ± 8.8 mL/min/1.73m2) we added CTD in a dose of 25 mg/d 
and doubled its dose every 4 weeks if BP remained elevated. Mixed modeled mean prescribed 
CTD dose at 4 weeks was 34 mg, at 8 weeks 55 mg, and at final visit 51 mg/ d. Over 12 weeks 
of treatment 24 -hour BP which was 143.1/75.1 mmHg at baseline was reduced by 10.5/3.1 
mmHg (p = 0.01/p=0.17, Figure 2). Home BP at baseline was 152.4/82.6 mmHg and fell at 4, 8, 
and 12 weeks by 10.2/4.8, 13.4/6.0, and 9.4/3.7 mmHg (all p<0 .05, Figure 3). Clinic BP was 
137.7/65.4 mmHg and was significantly reduced only at 8 weeks. Maximal reduction in body weight and total body volume was seen at 8 weeks concurrent with the maximal elevation in 
serum creatinine concentration and plasma renin activity ( Figure 4). Albuminuria was 
significantly reduced by 40- 45% from baseline. Adverse events following CTD therapy occurred 
in 7 participants: hypokalemia (n=4), hyperuricemia (4), hyponatremia (3), transient creatinine changes (3), dizziness (2), hyperglycemia (1), and constipation (1). One subject had ischemic 
stroke during the study. In conclusion, in advanced CKD, CTD has the potential to control 
hypertension; an RCT is now needed.

RESEARCH PROTOCOL AND TRIAL 
DESIGN  
 CLICK  will provide evidence for the specific role of thiazide diuretics in the management 
of hypertension in those with advanced CKD. BP control is the backbone of renal and 
cardiovascular protection, yet control rates are dismal.  Furthermore, the use of CTD has 
increased after publication of ALLHAT. This  study will examine  the benefits  of CTD  in a 
vulnerable group of patients including albuminuria  and providing surrogate evidence for target -
organ protection. The wider use of this  specific  thiazide diuretic  may also improve CV outcomes 
in CKD.  The results will help support the use of a low -cost, but potentially effective, 
antihypertensive drug in this high- risk group.  n

 Overall Trial Design and Plan  
To test the notion that CTD added to the regimen of antihypertensive drugs  will improve BP  in 
those with advanced CKD and uncontrolled hypertension, we propose a placebo- controlled, 
double- blind, randomized controlled trial  (Figure 5) . This trial will assess the effects of  CTD in 
patients  with CKD and poorly controlled hypertension.  According to the European Society of 
Hypertension (ESH 2013) guidelines , poorly controlled hypertension is defined as the average 
24-hour ambulatory blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg systolic or ≥ 80 mmHg diastolic45. During 
the study, doubling the dose of the diuretic or placebo will occur every 4 weeks if home BP 
remains above ≥135/85 mmHg. This level of BP was chosen because it roughly approximat es to 
the clinic BP of ≥140/90 mmHg,  which is  the current target for treatment for people with CKD. 
The effects will be assessed by [CONTACT_433176] 24 hours from 
baseline to 12 weeks.  
At baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter,  we will  also evaluate changes in albuminuria 
and markers of volume (renin, aldosterone, NT -proBNP , and body volume). Home BP will be 
measured prior to each clinic visit for one week, twice daily.  The final visit will be two weeks 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433155] a proper wash out period. At the post -termination visit, if 
the increase in home BP from drug discontinuation is ≥7/[ADDRESS_548867] 
12.5 mg/d will be administered. Further follow up will be provided by [CONTACT_2299]’s physician. Placebo run -in

Study Intervention  
Participants with CKD and poorly controlled hypertension, confirmed by [CONTACT_433178] -week  run-in, who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
administered the study drugs in increasing doses. There are 9 study related visits at week - 3, -2, 
0, 4, 8, 12, and 14. Visits occurring before randomization (week 0) will have a ± 2-day visit 
window. Any v isit occurring after randomization will have a ±  3-day window. At both  weeks 0 
and 12, visits o n two consecutive days are to perform 24h ambulatory BP monitoring  and 24 -
hour urine collection. Participants will be identified in the renal clinic on the basis of estimated 
GFR and BP. If they are on any antihypertensive medications excluding a thiazide- like diuretic 
in the prior 12 weeks (HCTZ, CTD,  or metolazone), they will be sent  home with a BP monitor . If 
the average systolic clinic blood pressure is <110 mmHg, they will not be further considered for 
participation.  This is based on our prior study that suggests the prevalence of uncontrolled 
hypertension is less than 2% in persons with a clinic systolic blood pressure of [ADDRESS_548869] regimen of 
antihypertensive medications from various classes of drugs, e.g.,  ACE inhibitors (lisinopril 20 -40 
mg/d), angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan 50 -100 mg/d if intolerant to ACE inhibitors), 
dihydr opyridine calcium channel blockers (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10 mg/d), beta blockers (atenolol 25 -100 
mg/d) and/or a loop diuretic (torsemide 10 -20 mg/d). The nature of the antihypertensive used 
will depend on their existing regimen. Thus, if they are on a beta -blocker and a diuretic, they will 
receive atenolol and torsemide. Doses will be selected based on what the patient is currently 
prescribed. For those on furosemide, 20 mg of furosemide will be considered equivalent to 10 
mg torsemide. Atenolol is renally cleared and has a long half- life in those with CKD. For those 
on metoprolol, 100 mg atenolol will be considered equivalent to 200 mg metoprolol.  For those on clonidine or minoxidil as fifth and sixth drugs, the doses of these drugs will be left unchanged. Some par ticipants receive alpha- blockers for prostatic symptoms. The dose of 
alpha- blockers will not be changed to avoid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_433156]. Those on K -
sparing diuretics ( e.g., amiloride, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], or eplerenone) will continue taking the  same 
dose with the drug remaining unchanged. The final dose of the standardized medication 
regimen will be determined by [CONTACT_5989]. All participants will be provided written instructions to consume a diet containing <100 mEq Na/day. 24-h our urine Na will be measured 
to assess dietary sodium  intake.  
Treatment Compliance  
We recognize the limitations of pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], however, we will assess treatment compliance 
with the study drug by [CONTACT_170491][INVESTIGATOR_433157].   
Protocol for managing blood pressure  
This is a forced -titration study,  thus the study drug will be increased if goal BP is not 
achieved. Goal BP is defined by [CONTACT_433179]. We will ask participants to provide BP 
18 | Final P rotocol  
 readings in triplicate twice a day for one week . The average of these will be used for decision 
making when it com es to medication management . However, if fewer than 3 days  of readings 
are available, we will make a decision based on clinic BP.  
The dose of study medication will not be increased if the patient has the following 
symptoms : home BP of <135 mmHg systolic, s ymptomatic hypotension, hypercalcemia, 
hypomagnesemia, moderate hypokalemia (K<3 meq/L), acute gout, or a recent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433158]. In these instances, the dose of the drug will be maintained or 
down- titrated based on investigator’s judgment.  
Stop points  
1. The study medication will be stopped , or the dose reduced , at the discretion of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_433159], drug- induced rash , or other 
adverse event attributable to the drug, or in the PI’s judgment the benefits of taking 
the medication outweigh the risks.  
2. If home BP averaged over one week exceeds either 179 mmHg systolic or 109 
mmHg diastolic, the dose of the study drug will be increased,  and participant will be 
called in 1 week with home BP recordings. If home BP recording remain ≥180/110 mmHg, the participant will be with drawn from the study.  
3. If home BP averaged over one week is 160 -179 mmHg systolic or 100- 109 mmHg 
diastolic, the dose of the study drug increased,  and participant will be called in two 
weeks. If BP is not <160/100 mmHg within 4 weeks, the participant will be withdrawn 
from the trial.   
Outcome Variables  
The outcome variables are as follows.  
Primary outcome:  
The primary outcome variable is the change from baseline to 12 weeks in systolic ambulatory 
BP in the CTD group compared to placebo.  
Secondary outcomes:  
1. Change from baseline at each 4 week  visit in the log transformed albumin/creatinine 
ratio in the CTD group compared to placebo.  
2. Change from baseline at each 4 week visit in  
a. log of aldosterone to renin ratio 
b. log of NT -proBNP,  
c. and body volume  
in the CTD group compared to placebo. No adjustments will be made for multiple 
comparisons.  
19 | Final P rotocol  
 Safety Assessments and Variables  
Harms will be assessed by [CONTACT_433180], potassium, calcium, uric acid 
and hemoglobin A1C. For more definitive assessments, the frequency of acute kidney injury 
(using AKIN definition), symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (fall >20 mmHg within 3 min of 
standing with symptoms), hypokalemia (mild <3.5 mEq/L, moderate to severe <3.0 mEq/L), need for K replac ement, hypercalcemia (>10.5 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (<1.8 mg/dL), gout 
(clinical diagnosis), and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433160]. A 
screening [ADDRESS_548870] formula < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 but ≥15 
mL/min/1.73m2. Our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433161] -calibrated creatinine, and the 
appropriate formula is used to estimate GFR.  
3. Hypertension, w hich is defined as BP of either ≥130 systolic or ≥[ADDRESS_548871] one 
antihypertensive drug. One of the drugs should be either an ACE inhibitor or 
angiotensin receptor blocker. If these are contraindicated, then use of a beta- blocker 
is required prior to randomization.  
Exclusion Criteria  
1. Use of thiazide or thiazide- like drugs in the previous 12 weeks.  
2. Use of furosemide in a dose >200 mg/d.  
3. BP of either ≥160 systolic or ≥100 mmHg by 24 -hour ambulatory BP monitoring.  
4. Expected to receive renal replacement therapy within the next 3 months.  
5. Myocardial  infarction, heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or stroke ≤3 months prior to 
randomization.  
6. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who are planning to become pregnant 
or those not using a reliable form of contraception (oral contraceptives , condoms and 
diaphragms will be considered reliable).  
7. Known hypersensitivity to thiazide or sulfa drugs.  
8. Organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_433162].  
 
20 | Final Prot ocolRetention of Subjects  
Nine study related visits are required. We will offer them $[ADDRESS_548872] a health questionnaire over the phone.  
Methods  
Method of Randomization 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_548873] in triplicate in both arms after applying an appropriately  sized cuff using a digital 
oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Model HEM -907, Omron Healthcare) following the 
recommendation of the European Society of Hypertension 
47. The arm and the forearm will be 
supported at the level of the heart (mid- sternal level) and the oscillometric BP averaged over 
three readings will be used as that clinic visit BP. The left arm will be used for all 
measurements, unless between arm reading exceed 5 mmHg systolic. If so, the arm with the higher BP will be designated the “BP arm” and will be used for  all subsequent  clinic BP 
measurements.  If subjects have a dialysis access (AV fistula or AV graft), we will use the non -
access arm for clinic  blood pressure measurements.  
21 | Final Prot ocol  
 Measurement of 24- hour Ambulatory BP  
Ambulatory BP monitoring will be performed in all participants at baseline prior to 
randomization and at the  end of the 12 weeks of treatment. We will use the Spacelabs [ZIP_CODE] 
monitor which has been shown to be accurate by [CONTACT_433181] (BHS) 
and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instruments (AAMI) 47. Appropriately sized 
cuffs will be used with bladder sizes that encircle 80– 100% of arm circumference and widths 
that are at least 40% of arm circumference. We will measure ABP every 20 minutes from 06:00 – 22:00 and every 30 minutes from 22:00 –  06:[ADDRESS_548874] 16 total recordings will be required to call 24h ambulatory BP 
adequate (excludi ng readings taken for monitor validation during ambulatory dispensing) . All 
ambulatory BP  measurements taken on subject’s  non-dominant arm. If subject has dialysis 
access, all measurements completed on non- access arm.  
Measurement of home BP  
Home BP measurements will be performed with a home digital sphygmomanometer with 
an automatic inflator and printer for recording (Model HEM790IT or the newer model BP791IT, 
Omron Healthcare, Inc, Vernon Hills, IL) with a cuff size appropriate for arm size. This monitor 
stores up to 200 measurements in memory that can be retrieved. A similar device (Omron HEM705CP) was used to monitor BP in the large Anglo- Scandinavian Cardiovascular 
Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) for the purposes of BP monitoring 
49. At minimum at least three days 
of home BP monitoring is  required for valid home BP recordings 50, 51. Thus, participants will be 
asked to record their BP after [ADDRESS_548875] ’s non -dominant arm. I f subject 
has dialysis access, all measurements completed on non -access arm.  
Chemical Determinations 
Chemical determinations on research samples will be conducted on those frozen at - 80C 
for analysis of NT -proBNP, plasma renin , plasma aldosterone, and urinary albumin and 
creatinine. Routine safety laboratory tests will be done in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433163] y. 
Air displacement plethysmography  
Air displacement plethysmography (ADP) will be measured using the BOD POD Gold 
Standard Body Composition Tracking System (Life Measurement, Inc, Concord, CA).  The ADP system consisted of the air plethysmograph, a digital s cale, and computer software (BOD POD 
version 4.2+). Each participant will be asked to change into compression shorts (for men) or a swimsuit (for women) and a swim cap and to remove any jewelry. Body mass will be measured to the nearest 0.001 kg using the electronic scale prior to the body volume measurement.  Height will be measured using a Seca 222 measuring rod (Seca Group, Hamburg, [LOCATION_013]).  
Manufacture recommended procedures will be used to measure body volume. Body fat percent 
22 | Final Prot ocol  
 will be calculated using gender and race -specific equations as follows: for non- blacks we will 
use the Siri equation 52, for black men the S chutte equation 53, and for black women the Ortiz 
equation 54. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (see below) suggest that this method is very sensitive in detecting 
changes in body volume in the time of the study.  
 
STATISTICAL METHODS  
Sample Size  
The primary objective of the study is to assess CTD -induced lowering of systolic BP.  
Sample size estimation was based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_433164] [ADDRESS_548876] to all others, this patient showed an inc rease in 
SBP of 31 mm Hg. We believe this outlier markedly increases the variability and reduces the 
estimated change in BP. Table 1 below shows the mean changes (standard deviation) and 
estimated sample size based on ambulatory SBP achieved by [CONTACT_323670], with a nd without this 
person and estimated sample size:  
 
Table 1: Estimates of change in 24- hour ambulatory systolic BP, variability, and sample size  
 SBP including outlier  SBP excluding outlier  
Change in average [ADDRESS_548877] this change  57 13 
 
We recognize that ignoring the outlier assumes this won’t occur and we do not believe 
that to be a safe assumption. However, the outlier has undue influence in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_433165]. While we 
don’t expect the impact of such cases in the larger Phase II study planned, we do accept that 
the -[ADDRESS_548878] the mean 
or other placebo effects (the pi[INVESTIGATOR_74489] a single group)  and the second is that there will be a few 
outliers that may impact the mean difference.  From an ongoing study of patients with CKD (with 
clinical characteristics similar to one proposed in this trial) who had ABPM performed [ADDRESS_548879] the SD at 12 weeks to be larger by [CONTACT_2902] 10% or [ADDRESS_548880] and 80% power, the required sample size to detect a between group difference of 6 mmHg is 63 subjects completing the study in each group.  Assuming 80% of those randomized complete the trial we would need to randomize 
63/0.80 = 79 subjects per group.    
For Aims 2 and 3 we will use similar techniques and ev aluated the confidence intervals 
of the changes. For the change in albumin/creatinine ratio from the 24 hours urine collections, 
the observed decline was consistent  and between 40- 45% regardless of whether daytime or 
nighttime coll ection of urine was evaluated. Power exceeded 99% for both daytime excretion as 
well as nighttime based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_433166] 63 subjects per group based on the observed 
23 | Final Prot ocol  
 changes on the natural log scale of 0.48 (0.613) nighttime and 0.57 (0.694) daytime from 
baseline to [ADDRESS_548881] 27% 
decline in UACR, which is clinically meaningful and an effect size that is more likely to be seen 
in the larger phase [ADDRESS_548882] repeated measures over tim e and 
using longitudinal data methods will greatly increase our power.  
From the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the mean change between baseline and final visit in Body Volume using 
Air Displacement Plethysmography was 1.234 (sd 2.88) with a similarly small within person standard deviation. Repeated measures analyses using Proc Mixed in SAS showed and 
estimated change of 1.[ADDRESS_548883] error of 0.7375, slightly larger due to the fitting of the 
model to all data points. A repeated measures design with two treatment arms and 4 
assessments over time with 60 subjects per group achieves the following power (computed using simulations with PASS) for various differences in the groups:  
 
Table 2: Power to detect minimum detectable difference in body volume with air displacement 
plethy smography   
Minimum 
detectable difference  0.[ADDRESS_548884] is measured 4 times. This design achieves 82% power to test the 
treatment difference in volume is at least 1.54 with a 5% significance level assuming the 
variance of the volume assessments is [ADDRESS_548885] the volume 
measurements is 0.75. If the true mean difference were only 1.234 instead of the model 
estimated 1.54, the power would still exceed 60% . 
Analyses  
The analyses will begin with descriptive statistics. Overall and by [CONTACT_433182]. Tests for differences in demographics 
between the randomized group; characteristics of dropouts will be computed using t -tests, chi-
square (or fisher’s exact tests) to understand if potential differences exist, although such 
differences are not expected.   
Primary Analysis  
To test the hypothesis that CTD will improve the 24-hour SBP assessed by [CONTACT_433183] 12 weeks. A mixed model will be used to analyze the results. The outcome variable 
will be the 24h ambulatory systolic BP. The predictors will be indicator variables for group 
(placebo or CTD), time (baseline and 12 weeks), stratum (loop diuretics use or not) and all their interactions. The random component of the mixed model will include subject and time. 
Unstructured covariance will be used with estimation of marginal means by [CONTACT_54683]. We expect the interaction between group x time to be significant. If the [ADDRESS_548886] interaction term is 
significant, then results will be reported by [CONTACT_433184]. Confirmatory analyses will utilize the home systolic BP change from baseline. The random coefficient analysis does not require baseline systolic BP as a covariate.   
24 | Final Prot ocol  
 Ambulatory BP recording, the gold- standard to assess BP, is carried out only twice 
during the trial, but home BP measurements occur every [ADDRESS_548887] baseline measures of home BP (which will occur every 4 weeks) will be used i n 
the analyses, thus minimizing the losses to follow up. We will impute ambulatory BP as follows: 
we will use the complete data to build a model that relates the follow up mean 24hour 
ambulatory systolic BP from the baseline 24 -hour ambulatory systolic BP and the home 
measures using repeated measures Mixed Model regression -  then use the expected value from 
the model for the missing value -  and use PROC MI (which generates maybe [ADDRESS_548888] the differences between the 
treatment groups using the home BPs. Repeated measures  mixed models (PROC MIXED in 
SAS) will be utilized to assess the overall differences between the treatment group using the home blood pressures. Additional analyses will explore the nocturnal patterns between the 
groups in the ambulatory blood pressures as  well as the pattern over time given the once a day 
dosing proposed in this study using circadian models of blood pressure in each group  
The null hypothesis we intend to reject is that there is no between group change from 
baseline in albumin excretion rat e. Measurements of these markers will occur at weeks 0, 4, 8, 
and 12. The outcome variable will be the log transformed urine albumin/urine creatinine ratio 
(UACR). The predictors will be an indicator variable for group (placebo or CTD), a continuous 
variable of time (baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks), stratum and all interaction terms. The random 
component of the mixed model will include subject and time . Unstructured covariance will be 
used with estimation of marginal means by [CONTACT_54683].   
The null hypothesis we intend to reject is that there is no between group change from 
baseline in markers of extracellular fluid volume as measured by (i) N -terminal pro B -type 
natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ), (ii) plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) and (iii) body 
volume. Measurements of these markers will occur at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Thus, three 
different models will be fitted.  In the first model, the outcome variable will be the log 
transformed NT-proBNP . The predictors, fixed variables, and random variables  will be as noted 
above.  Similar analyses will be performed for ARR and body volume. To test the hypothesis 
that CTD is causal in this improvement in BP via a reduction in extracellular fluid volume, we will 
evaluate changes from baseline in the following extracellular fluid volume markers: NT-proBNP, 
seated plasma renin, and plasma aldosterone. That is, we will test if the improvement is a 
mediation effect using the technique described by [CONTACT_433185]
55 and elaborated by 
[CONTACT_38722]56. The technique, expanded here for more than one potential mediator 
(simultaneously NT-proBNP , seated plasma renin, and plasma aldosterone = mediators), 
employs three regression equations:  
 
Y = β0 + τXp +  ε 
Xi =  β0 + αiXp + ε 
Y = β0 + τ'Xp + β1X1 + … + β iXi + …+ βkXk + ε  for all mediators together  
or  Y = β0 + τ'Xp + βiXi  ε for each mediator separately  
 
25 | Final Prot ocol  
 Y is the outcome result ( e.g., change in 24 -hour ambulatory systolic BP), X p is the 
treatment and X i represent the k purported mediators. the total effect of the treatment on the 
outcome (measured by [CONTACT_433186], τ ) is the sum of direct effect ( τ′) of the treatment and the 
mediated, or indirect, effects ( αiβi). Mediation is established when four conclusions are met:  (1) 
the treatment predicts the outcome variable (supported by a test of statistical significance of τ  in 
equation [A]); (2) the treatment causes the potential m ediator (αi is significant in [B]); (3) the 
mediator causes the outcome variable controlling for the treatment ( βi is significant in [C] and τ ' 
< τ which provides evidence for mediation rather than suppression); and (4) the mediated effect 
is statistically  significant. For mediators that satisfy conclusions 1 through 3, the significance of 
the mediation (conclusion 4) will be determined via interval estimation of the mediated effect 
using the asymptotic variance derivation of Sobel57, since the outcomes are the continuous  
measures. Additional analyses that look at thresholds of change (binary, successful reduction in SBP or not) wilI utilize the bootstrap methods
[ADDRESS_548889], or αβ/τ.  
Pre-specified sub- group analysis for BP response 
• Effect of age: The effect of age 65 or more and <65 will be tested using interaction effects.  
• Effect of sex , presence/absence of albuminuria (>300 mg/g cr at baseline) will be 
assessed as above.  
• Effect of volume overload: Volume overloaded subjects are more likely to show 
improvement with CTD therapy. In people with volume overload, renin and 
aldosterone levels are expected to be low, N -terminal pro B -type natriuretic 
peptide levels elevated and 24- hour urine Na high. We will dichotomize the 
baseline levels of these markers and examine the outcome on ambulatory BP 
using interaction effects.  
Safety analysis  
The number of subjects who experience hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, gout, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433167], transient elevations in serum creatinine concentration, and symptomatic orthostatic hypotension will be counted for each group and compared using a Poisson regression model using terms for treatment and treatment x stratum. The statistical significance of the treatment term will be used to indicate differences between CTD and 
placebo. If the interaction term is significant then the event r ates will be reported for each 
stratum. The mean change from baseline in serum potassium, calcium, estimated GFR, uric acid, HgbA1C, PTH intact, and orthostatic BP will be calculated using mixed models as noted above.  
Secondary analysis  
1. The mean change from baseline in 24- hour diastolic BP.  
26 | Final Prot ocol  
 2. The proportion of subjects who achieve at least a 10-mmHg  reduction in ambulatory 
systolic BP or a 5 -mmHg reduction in diastolic BP will be called responders. 
Responders will be compared by [CONTACT_19313].   
3. The proport ions of responder subjects who achieve final ambulatory BP of 
<130/[ADDRESS_548890] 10% drop 
in systol ic BP with sleep. Between group differences in the above analyses will be 
compared using interaction tests in a logistic regression model.  
5. The time -course of systolic home BP will be analyzed using week as a continuous 
variable. It is expected that the drop in BP in the initial [ADDRESS_548891] 
a flat response or a linear decline. Accordingly, we will use a term for week and 
square of the week in the CTD group only. Between group differences will be tested 
using marginal means.  
 
Alternative study design considerations and clarifications  
Choice of CTD :  CTD was selected over HCTZ since it has a longer half -life (40 -60 hrs 
versus 2.5 hrs in those with normal renal  function) and potentially greater BP lowering effects.  
According to KDOQI, compared to hydrochlorothiazide, CTD may be effective at a lower GFR 
(KDOQI provides no reference). Although metolazone has been used in high doses in people 
with CKD, but it is n early [ADDRESS_548892] selected it over others  
Choice of torsemide as loop diuretic : Compared to furosemide, torsemide has more 
predictable bioavailability. Whereas the bioavailability of furosemide can vary from 10 -100% 58, 
the bioavailability of torsemide is between 78 -92% 59. Among those with renal failure, the 
bioavailability of torsemide is 100% 60. Thus, with torsemide use, more predictable absorption 
and less inter -individual variation in diuretic responses are expected 61. Although bumetanide 
has more predictable bioavailability than furosemide, it is less natriuretic than furosemide 62.  
Furthermore, torsemide has a longer half -life and its use as once daily diuretic is likely to 
enhance adherence. In a RCT that we performed among participants with CKD, the anti -
hypertensive effect of torsemide given once a day was similar to furosemide given twice daily 63.  
Accordingly, we have chosen torsemide as the agent of choice for a loop diuretic.  
Choice of fixed- dose versus forced -titration study : Since we do not know the dose at 
which chlorthalidone will produce a decline in BP, we have designed this as a forced -titration 
study.  It is quite likely, that the BP lowering effects will vary according to the GFR. Therefore, 
titration of dose may be required. Thus, the dose at which CTD improves BP will be 
individualized in this protocol.  
 
27 | Final Prot ocol  
 TIMETABLE/MILESTONES  
 We expect to recruit and randomize a total of [ADDRESS_548893] (DSMB)  
A DSMB will meet periodically to review the progress of the trial. Should signal of harms 
emerge, the trial can be terminated early. This will be in addition to periodic and mandatory 
reporting requirement to the IRB.  No interim efficacy analysis is planned.  
 
HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Protection of Human Subjects  
The trial has been designed to reflect current clinical practices. The titration scheme of 
the drugs reflects current clinical practice. After completion of the [ADDRESS_548894] excessive rise in blood pressure, 
subjects will be called 2 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_433168] 7/4 mmHg or more.  
Risks 
1. Risks associat ed with taking chlorthalidone include  drop in blood concentrations of 
various electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and chloride. This drug can 
aggravate diabetes, gout, and increase blood calcium. Other side effects include 
excessive drop in blood press ure especially when standing and impotence.  
2. Risks related to blood pressure changes and blood pressure medication changes. 
Risks of blood pressure drop include: light headedness, dizziness, kidney injury, or 
rarely stroke or myocardial ischemia or infarcti on. The risks of blood pressure rising 
excessively include stroke, heart failure, myocardial ischemia or infarction, or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].  
3. Pain, bruising, and rarely infection from drawing blood from a vein in the arm  
4. Lower quality of sleep and discomfort while s leepi[INVESTIGATOR_433169] 24- hour blood 
pressure monitor.  
5. Discomfort from the blood pressure machine cuff.  
6. Discomfort from being enclosed within the BODPOD for body composition 
measurement. Patients will be asked if they have a fear of closed spaces before  
starting the measurement.  
7. Risks related to possible loss of confidentiality.  
Protection against risks and reporting of adverse events  
To protect against risks,  we are only recruiting subjects, who have poorly controlled 
hypertension by [CONTACT_433187].  
1. Subjects will be closely monitored while receiving chlorthalidone and they will be 
questioned about possible side effects.  
28 | Final Prot ocol  
 2. Blood pressure will be monitored continuously,  and other possible side effects will be 
monitored through blood tests we are obtaining.  
3. Blood will be drawn by a trained phlebotomist and whenever possible it will be 
obtained at a time when blood is being obtained for other tests the subject’s doctor 
has ordered.  
4. All patient charts are kept in an office locked after normal working hours and when 
no one is in the office. All electronic databases are password protected.  
5. We will make sure all subjects are wearing the correct cuff size.  
6. The automatic blood pressure monitor will be set for the sound to be turned off at night to minimiz e the disruption of sleep.  
Adverse experience will be recorded to include the date and time of onset, description, 
severity, duration and outcome, etiology, relationship to study drug, and action taken.  
 
Should a serious adverse experience (defined as death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207456], life- threatening or permanently disabling) occur at any time and is deemed 
possibly, probably , or definitely related to the study drug, the Investigator will report the incident 
to the IRB following t he locally accepted regulations.  
Adverse events of special interest  
Due to the relatedness of many adverse events with use of thiazide diuretics we will use 
the following list as adverse events of special interest (AEOSI)  
 
Acute gout : clinical diagnosis in the presence of symptoms.  
Acute kidney injury (AKI)  
Mild AKI: a n increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 25% but < 50% from baseline value.   
Severe AKI: a n increase  in serum creatinine of ≥ 50% from baseline value . 
Dizziness: symptoms with observed decrease in blood pressure < 20 mmHg systolic while 
standing. If decrease in blood pressure is > 20 mmHg, see orthostatic hypotension . 
Orthostatic hypotension: greater than 20 mmHg drop  in systolic blood pressure within 3 minutes 
of standing w hen in the presence of symptoms.  
Hypercalcemia: serum calcium concentration >  10.5 mg/dL .  
Hyperglycemia: in patients without diabetes  when random glucose is > 200 mg/dL or in patients 
with diabetes  when random glucose > 300 mg/dL (mild/moderate) ; severe when random 
glucose is > 400 mg/dL.   
Hyperkalemia: serum potassium concentration > 5.5 mmol/L.  
Hyperuricemia : serum uric acid concentration > 12.0 mg/dL in patients with a serum creatinine 
concentration > 2.0 mg/dL.  
29 | Final Prot ocolHypokalemia: serum potassium concentration < 3.5 mmol/L but ≥ 3.0 mmol/L (mild); serum 
potassium concentration < 3.0 mmol/L (moderate to severe) . 
Hypomagnesemia : serum magnesium concentration < 1.80 mg/dL  
Hyponatremia: serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L.

1. Abs tract   
Patient  preference  for medications  in place  of osmotic  dilators  as cervical  preparation  is 
well known.  Twent y-­­four to [ADDRESS_357797]  demonstrated  equal  efficacy  in second -­­trimes ter medical  abortion  but 
have not been compa red as cervical  preparat ion for second -­­trimes ter surgical ab ortion.  
  
This  study  will randomize  participants  undergoing  a second -­­trimes ter surgical  abortion 
between  16 0/7 -­­20 6/7 weeks  gestation  to 200mg  mifepristone  followed  20 -­­24 hours  later 
with  400mcg  vaginal  misoprostol  and buccal plac ebo versus  400mcg  buccal  miso prostol and

dilation  is required  or forceps  if no further  dilation  required)  to last instrument  out of the 
uterus .  The study  uses  a supe riorit y desig n an d is po wered to detect a 4-­­minute differe nce  
in proced ure time from a ba seline of 10±5 minutes with 90%  power and two-­­taile d alpha

2. Specific  Aims  
This  study  aims  to compare  mifepristone  and buccal  misoprostol  to mifepristone  and 
vaginal  misoprostol  for cervical  preparation  for second  trimester  D&E.  We hypothesize 
that giving  oral  mifepristone  20 -­­24 hours  and vaginal  misoprostol  1-­­2 hours  prior  to D&E 
will provide  better  cervical  dilation  than  mifepristone  20 -­­24 hours  and buccal  misoprostol  
1-­­2 hours  prior  to D&E.  The primary  outcome  of the study  will be length of  procedure  as 
measured  by [CONTACT_293726]  (dilator  if further  dilation  is required  or force ps if 
no further  dilation  required)  to last instrument  out of the uterus.  Secondary  outcomes will 
include  cervical  dilation  achieved  as measured  by [CONTACT_293727],  total dilation  required,  blood  loss, 
pain,  complications,  provider  assessment  of difficulty,  and provider  and patient  acceptance 
and recommendation  for other  patients.  
 
3. Previous  research  
The addition  of mifepristone,  a progesterone  antagonist,  to a misoprostol  regimen  has been 
shown  to significantly  decrease  the medic ation-­­to-­­abortion interval  in secon d-­­trimes ter 
induction  terminations.1 Vaginal  administration  has demonstrated  improved  dilation  as 
compared  to buccal  administration  but it  is known  that  patients  prefer  buccal 
administration.2  A comparison  of mifepristone  and vaginal  versus  mifepristone  and buccal 
misoprostol  has not been  studied  prior  to seco nd-­­trimes ter surgical  abortion.  
 
A Cochrane  review  (2010)  of cervical  preparation  for second -­­trimes ter D&E  did not 
recommend  mifepristone  and misoprostol  for cervical  priming  due to high  rates  of pre-­­ 
procedural  expulsions.  3 However,  the primary  basis  for this conclusion  is the trial  by 
[CONTACT_293728]. in  which  the 48 -­­hour interval  between  the medications  accounts  for the 
high  out -­­of-­­facility expulsion  risk.4  A retrospective  cohort  of over  200  women  betw een 14 
and 19  6/7 weeks  gestation  showed  no difference  in difficulty  of cervical  dilation  for 
patients receiv ing mifepristone  24 -­­48 hours  misoprostol  as compared  to osmotic  dilators 
prior  to surgical  abortion.  Two  out of  facility  expulsions  occurred  in the mife pristone-­­ 
misoprostol  arms  but the  timing  of medication  to expulsion  interval  is not reported.[ADDRESS_357800]  a 
3-­­minute difference  in procedure  time.6  A 24 -­­hour interval  between  200mg  mifepristone 
and 400mcg  buccal  misoprostol  has been  shown  as non-­­inferior  to osmotic  dilators  for 
total  procedure  time  for 15 -­­18 week surgical  abortions .7 Mifepristone  and one -­­set of 
osmotic  dilators  was  found  to be non -­­inferior  for total  procedure  time  as compared  to two 
sets  of osmotic  dilators  for surgical  abortion  19 -­­23 6/[ADDRESS_357801]  or 
alternative  to osmotic  dilators  for surgical  abortion,  but it  is not known  whether  the 
addition  of vaginal  versus  buccal  misopros tol changes  cervical  dilation  and thus  procedure 
time  outcomes.  
 
4. Rationale  
Mifepristone and Misopros tol for Surg ical Abor tion Cerv ical Prepara tion Case y 
3  
  
 
Second -­­trimes ter dilation  and evacuation  (D&E)  procedures  at [ADDRESS_357802]  traditionally  been  used  for cervical  dilation  
but it  is known that patients  prefer  medication  to dilators.10    Misoprostol  alone  can be used  
for early  second  trimester  dilation  but is  associated  with  increased  requirement  for 
dilation.11  Adding  mifepristone  to buccal  misoprostol  was  found  to be non-­­inferior  to 
osmotic  dilators  for procedure  time  for 15 -­­18 weeks  gestation.7  Mifepristone  alone  was 
found  to provide  adequate  cervical  preparation  up to  16 weeks  gestation .6  Vaginal 
misoprostol  is associated  with  fewer  gastrointestinal  side  effects  as compared  to buccal 
administration  and is  associa ted with  a shorter  induction  to delivery  interva l.12  This  study 
aims  to evaluate  mifepristone  and buccal  versus  mifepristone  and vaginal  misoprostol 
(with  an interval  of at least  20 hours  between  the medications)  for gestational  ages  16 0/7 
to 20 6/7.  This  study  will contribute  to the literature  evaluating  medication  only  cervical 
preparation  prior  to second -­­trimes ter procedures.  
 
5. Research  design  and  General  Methodological  Approach  
We have  chosen  a randomized  controlled  trial  to ensure  that  neither  patient  nor provider  
will be biased  by [CONTACT_293729].  Seventy -­­two English  or Spanis h-­­speaking women 
greater  than 18  years  of age and at 16  0/7 -­­20 6/7 weeks  gestation  will be  enrolled  with 36 
women  in each  arm.  
 
Comput er-­­generated randomization  will be utilized  to assign  treatment  arms  and the 
vaginal  misoprostol  and buccal  placebo  and buccal  misoprostol  and vaginal  misoprostol 
will be  prepared  according  to randomization  scheme  by [CONTACT_293730]-­­ 
sealed  envelopes  as to blind  participants  and provider s. 
 
One  arm  will receive  mifepristone  200mg  orally  20 -­­24 hours  prior  and misoprostol  
400mcg  (two  200mcg  tablets)  vaginally  1-­­2 hours  prior  and placebo (two  lactose  tablets 
designed  to appear  similar  to misoprostol)  buccally  1-­­2 hours  prior  to D&E.  The second arm 
will receive  mifepristone  200mg  orally  20 -­­24 hours  prior  and misoprostol  400mc g (two 
200mcg  tablets)  buccally  and placebo  (two  lactose  tablets  designed  to appear  similar to  
misoprostol)  vaginally  1-­­[ADDRESS_357803] the 
tablets in  the pre -­­opera tive area  from  pre-­­marked envelopes.  The patient will be  instructed 
to take  the medication  in the envelope  marked  buccally  (misoprostol  400  mcg  or placebo) to 
be placed  in the cheek  pouch  for 30 minutes  and then  remaining  swallowed  and the 
envelope  marked  vaginally  (misoprostol  400mcg  or placebo)  to be placed  vaginally  as far 
as the patient can insert  with  her finger.  The patient will be  witnessed  taking the  buccal 
medication  but the  patient  will be given  privacy  for vaginal  administration.  The time  will 
be recorded  in the patient's  chart.  Prior  to the  procedure,  patient  assessment  of 
medications  will be obtained  as detailed  in 5.5. 
 
At 1-­­2 hours  after  misoprostol  and placebo  administration,  the participant  will be brought 
into  a procedure  room  for a dilation  and evacuation  (D&E).  Prior  to the D&E,  an assessment 
of cervical  dilation  will be made  as assessed  by [CONTACT_293731] 39-­­French . Only the  attending  will assess  cervical  dilation  but 
procedures  will be performed  by [CONTACT_293732]-­­in-­­training.  Type  of provider 
will be recorded.

Five  time  estimates  will be recorded:  1) time  interval  between  mifepristone  and 
misoprostol/placebo  placement,  2) time  interval  between  misoprostol  insertion  and 
assessment  of cervical  dilation  3) total  procedure  time  (speculum  in to speculum  out),  4) 
intraoperative  procedure  time  designated  as start  of additio nal dilation  (if required)  or 
start  of uterine  instrumentation  (if further  dilation  not required)  to time  of last instrument 
removed  from  uterus.  Following  the procedure,  provider  assessment  will be obtained  as 
detailed  in section  5.5. 
 
5.1 Criteria  for s election  of subjects  
The trial  will be  conducted  at Virginia  Commonwealth  University  Medical  Center  (VCUHS)  
and Virginia  League  of Planned  Parenthood  (VLPP)  over  the course  of approximately 
fourteen  months.  The study  will enroll  healthy  women,  over  18 years of age,  eligible  for 
non -­­urgent D&E  at 16  0/7 weeks to 20  6/7 weeks  gestation,  confirmed  by [CONTACT_293733]. 
Patients  presenting  to either  office  in consultation  for a D&E  will be  recruited  for 
participation.  Exclusion  criteria  will include:  emergent  need  for D&E,  intrauterine 
infection,  fetal  demise,  molar  pregnancy,  multiple  pregnancy,  uterine  anomaly  or 
significant  distortion  of the uterus  with  fibroids,  intolerance,  allergy  or contraindication  to 
mifepristone  or misoprostol.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_357804]  recruitment  and  allocation  
Both VCUHS  and VLPP  serve  representative  samples  of Richmond,  Virginia.  Second 
trimester  services  at VLPP  started  in 03/2014.  
 
After  the patient  has completed  the counseling  process  and decided  to proceed  with  an 
induced  abortion,  she will be  approached  by [CONTACT_5640]  a co -­­invest igator or research  staff 
member  and asked  to participate  in the study.  A detailed  explanation  of the study  will be 
provided  and informed  consent  obtained  in English  or Spanish,  according  to patient 
preference.  A copy  of the informed  consent  will be given  to the patient.  Eligibility for  the 
study  will be confirmed.  
 
The VCU  Investigational  Research  pharmacy  will prepare  the allocation  sequence  for 
preparation  of allocation envelopes.  Subjects will be allocated in  blocks  of 4-­­6.  A 
researcher  not involved  in subject  recruitment  and without  participant  contact  [CONTACT_293734],  blinded  pi[INVESTIGATOR_293722]  (misoprostol  or placebo)  enclosed.  The envel ope will not 
contain  information  that  would  reveal  the group  assignment.  The envelope  will not be 
assigned  to a participant  until  eligibility  is confirmed.  The envelope  will not be  opened 
until  just prior  buccal  and vaginal  placement.  The allocation  number  will be recorded 
twice  in the participant’s  char t. The envelope  will be  attached  to the  chart.  The envelope 
will only  have  the allocation  number  on the outside  and the blinded  pi[INVESTIGATOR_293723].

5.4 Admission  procedure  
Recruitment  will begin  July 2015  and extend  for approximately  fourteen-­­months, 
ending  once  enrollment  is complete.  Patients  presenting  to VCUHS  or VLPP  will be 
enrol led, as described  in 5.2. Following  enrollment,  the patient  will comple te an admission 
form  including  baseline  demographics  and reproductive  history.  
 
After  ensuring  the patient  meets  eligibility  criteria,  has signed  consents  and 
following  the preoperative  assessment,  a research  staff  member  will give  the patient 
mifepristone  200mg  to take  orally  in the staff  member's  presence  and the time  will be 
recorded  in the patient's  chart.  The following  day,  a research  assistant  will dispense  two 
numbered  (one  vaginal  and one buccal)  envelopes  as described  in 5.2 upon arrival  to VCU 
Medical  Center  for the procedur e. Prior  to dispensing  the envelope,  the research  staff 
member  will examine  the allocation  numbers  as recorded  in the patient's  chart  to ensure  a 
match.  
 
5.5 Patient  and  Provider  Assessment  
The patient  will complete  the survey  immediately  prior  to the procedure  to provide  an 
accurate  assessment  of medication  acceptability  and side  effects  prior  to anesthesia.  The 
patient  survey  will assess  pain  (as measured  using  an 11 -­­point visual  analog scale)  and 
acceptability  of treat ment  with  respect  to ease  of use,  side  effects,  and recommendation  to 
others  (as measured  using  a 5-­­point Likert  scale).  
 
The provider  will complete  the assessment  immediately  following  the procedure.  The 
provider  assessment  elicits  estimated  blood  loss,  complications,  ease  of cervical  dilation 
(with  responses  rated  on an 11 -­­point visual analog  scale),  procedure  difficulty, 
recommendation  for same  patient  and recommendation  for other  patients (as  measured 
using  a 5-­­point Likert  scale).  
 
5.6 Criteria  for discontinuation

6  
  
 
Any  participants  who  meet  any one of the following  criteria  at any  point  after  enrollment 
will be discontinued  from  the study:  
• Urgent  need  for a D&E  
• Decision  not to  proceed  with  the D&E  
• Decision  to stop  participat ion in the study  
 
5.7 Data  management  
Data  will be entered  by [CONTACT_293737] a computer  at each  center 
accessible  only  to the primary  and co -­­invest igators and research  coordinator  via password 
protection.  
 
5.9 Data  analysis  
STATA  statistical  software  (StataCorp  LP, College  Station,  TX, www.stata.com ) will be used 
to analyze  the baseline  characteristics  of the populations  based  on the study  questionnaires 
completed  by [CONTACT_293738].  Primary  and secondary  outcomes  will 
be recorded  as described  above  in 5.4. Both  primary  and secondary  outcomes  will be 
analyzed  using  t-­­tests or  appropriate  non-­­parametric comparison  tests  as appropriate.  The 
perception  assessments  (VAS)  will be  assessed  using non -­­parametric analysis.  The 
primary  analysis  will be based  on intention  to treat.

gestations as  clinically  signifi cant.6  For this study  evaluating  16 -­­   20 6/7 week gestations, 
we chose  4-­­minute difference  as clinically  significant.  Using  a superiority  design,  in order to 
detect  a 4-­­minute change  in procedure  time  from  a baseline  of [ADDRESS_357810]

5.[ADDRESS_357812]  been taken to ensure  internal  validity in  that both  participants  and practitioners 
will be blinded  to allocation  of treatment  versus  placebo.  We will ask both  providers  and 
part icipants  which  group  they  believe  the participant  was  in to determine  if group 
assignment  was  detectable.

Limitations  of this study  will include  potential  extension  of time  for recruitment  and a 
relatively  small  sample  size.  
 
6. Links  with  other  projects  
There  is a multicenter  trial  comparing  the addition  of mifepristone  versus  misoprostol  to 
osmotic  dilators  versus  dilators  alone.  
 
7. Expected  outcomes  of the  study  and  dissemination  of findings  
If 20 -­­24 hour  mifepristone  and 2-­­4 hour  misoprostol  produces  better  cervical  dilation  than 
misoprostol  only  for second  trimester  D&E's,  this regimen  could  increase  the medication 
only  options  for surgical  procedures.  We plan on  publishing the  study  in a reproductive 
health  journal and  giving  oral presentations  of results.

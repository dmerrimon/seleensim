Study Design  This is a prospective, open -label Phase 1/2 study to evaluate copper Cu 64 
PSMA I&T injection for PET/CT imaging  in patients with recurrent 
metastatic prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.   
Phase 1  
The Phase 1 portion of the study will include a total of 12 patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer. Patients will be randomized into three g roups of 
four patients. Patients in each  group will receive a single intravenous dose 
of 5, 7, or 9 mCi of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T.  Whole -body PET/CT

administered for the Phase 2 study.  
Phase 2  
The Phase 2 porti on of the study will include a separate group of 26 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Each patient will be administered 
the same intravenous dose of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection

CONFIDENTIAL  Pharmacokinetic/Radiation Absorbed Dose:  
Whole body PET/CT scans will be acquired at 1 hour ± 15 minutes, 4 
hours ± 30 minutes , and 24 hours ± 2.[ADDRESS_989343]  (VOI)  will be delineated for the kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, 
urinary bladder , salivary glands , and total body.  Image count values will be 
corrected  for radioactive decay, scanner response, start/stop times , and net 
injecte d dose.  The remaining activity will be assumed to be distributed 
homogeneously throughout the body after  adjusting for  activit y in the 
organs, blood, and voided urine.  Organ -specific and whole -body radiation 
dose analysis will be performed using OLINDA/EXM  software , following 
Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) guidelines.  
Voided urine activity values will be accounted for in the dosimetry 
analysis by [CONTACT_724716] [ADDRESS_989344] -
injection.  The total voided urine volu me for each interval will be measured 
and the total radioactivity calculated by [CONTACT_49719] a calibrated 
standardized sample  or per Site’s standard methods . Calibrated urine 
voiding curves will be determined and included in the dosimetry analysis.  
Venous blood samples will be collected prior to copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T 
injection and at [ADDRESS_989345] measured in a well counter 
for dosimetry analysis  or per Site’s standard methods . No metabolite 
analysis will be performed on the blood or urine samples.  
Estimates of radiation absorbed dose will be calculated for all patients with 
the data fro m the VOI analysis at each imaging timepoint.   
Dose -Range  Evaluation : 
The [ADDRESS_989346]-injection PET/CT images for all patients will 
be evaluated for diagnostic image quality by [CONTACT_724717] s administered . Image quality 
will be assessed using the following scoring system: 0 = ina dequate (grainy 
images with poor delineation of lesions); 1 = questionable (clear images, 
but lesion delineation is suboptimal and small lesions [1 cm] are hard to 
assess); 2 = acceptable (clear images, large and small lesion delineation is 
possible). Coho rt scores will be calculated by [CONTACT_724718].  
In addition, the blinded readers will record lesion signal -to-noise, 
Maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUV max), lesion -contrast -to-noise and 
lesion -to-normal tissue  values derived from VOI values as described in the 
Independent Read er Manual . The cohort scores and image quality

CONFIDENTIAL  Baseline Assessments:  
Routine clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be obtained for 
all patients prior to dosing.  PSA will also be obtained for all patients prior 
to dosing.  
Medical history and physical examination will be performed prio r to 
dosing.  This will include information on the history of the prostate cancer. 
Concomitant medication history will also be obtained . 
Imaging Procedure:  
All p atients  will undergo PET/CT imaging at 1 hour ± 15 minutes and 4 
hours ± 30 minutes  following copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection  using the 
dose determined in Phase 1. The 1  hour and 4-hour images will be 
independently read by [CONTACT_724719].  Specifically, each reader will categorize images as 
“Disease” or “No Disease” based only on tumor uptake of copper Cu 64 
PSMA -I&T in each of the four regions : 1) prostate bed or prostate gland , 
2) lymph nodes (pelvic and extra pelvic), 3) bone, and 4) viscera/soft 
tissue .  
Efficacy Analysis:  
Composite Reference Standard  
All patients will undergo an efficacy assessment based on copper Cu 64 
PSMA I&T PET/CT results and the results of clinical presentation for 
evaluation against the Composite Reference Standard.  
The Composite Reference Standard  is defined as follows :  
 Local histopathology obtained from prostate cancer surgery or 
biopsy  obtained within 60 days  before or  following copper  Cu 64 PSMA 
I&T PET/CT , or 
 If histopathology is not available, anatomical correlation of 
conventional image findings (e.g., targeted MRI or CT or any FDA -
approved PET PSMA agent) that are acquired prior to locoregional or 
systemic treatment  and within 60 d ays before or  following copper Cu 64 
PSMA I&T PET/CT  
Safety Assessments:  
All patients will be followed for adverse events for [ADDRESS_989349] localization rate (CLR) of 
copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection PET/CT imaging for the detection of 
recurrent metastatic prostate cancer at 1- and [ADDRESS_989350] one true 
PET positive lesion, with exactly localized correspondence between 
PET/CT imaging and the Composite Reference Standard  regardless of any 
co-existent false positive findings, within the same region, out of all 
regions containing at least one PET positive finding . 
 To determine the patient -level correct detection rate (CDR) of 
copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection PET/CT imaging for the detection of 
recurrent metastatic prostate cancer at [ADDRESS_989351] disease, the CLR is a 
measure of the sensitivity of the copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection scan. 
Current methods have a CLR  of 60%; thus, the hypothesis to be tested in 
the Phase 2 portion of the study is:  H0: πC = π0 versus HA: πC > π0  where 
πC is the CLR for copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection  and π0 is the CLR 
from the literature (estimated to be 60%).  
This hypothesis will be tested using an exact one -sample binomial test with 
a one -sided α=0.025.  
Secondary  Objective : 
The secondary  objective  for the Phase 2 study is to compare the diagnostic 
quality of  PET/CT  images obta ined at [ADDRESS_989352] copper Cu 
64 PSMA I&T injection . 
Safety Endpoint : 
To assess the safety of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection in patients with 
recurrent prostate cancer.  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_640898], clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis , ECG, and vital signs.  
Analysis Populations : 
Several analysis populations of patients are defined, which may provide a 
more complete description of the collected data, provide a logical 
mechanism for groupi[INVESTIGATOR_724712], 
and/or allow appropriate stratification of  various analyses.  
 The Enrolled Patient Population (EPP) represents patients who sign 
an Informed Consent Form and have baseline data.

*Title of study:
Efficacy of a variably-occluded facemask in voice therapy

Current Semi Occluded Voice Therapy (SOVT) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_727751], which does not promote 
learning of the healthy voice behavior in connected speech or generalization to 
conversation. However, recent preliminary results using a semi-occluded mask 
indicate that the use of certain mask port diameters may allow for natural speech 
production while increasing supraglottal pressure and impedance, and thereby [CONTACT_727772]. In addition, the use of a semi­
occluded mask provides the possibility for a better transition from phonating single 
phonemes in therapy to training the target therapy techniques in connected speech. 
A healthy voice is essential for communicative activities of daily living.

Treatment of voice disorders varies but often involves voice therapy and/or surgical 
intervention. Voice therapy, a non-invasive behavioral treatment for voice disorders, 
helps patients develop beneficial voice habits, prevents recurrence of voice 
disorders, and facilitates long-lasting vocal improvement. Many voice therapy 
techniques involve a semi-occluded vocal tract (SOVT). SOVT treatment is often 
characterized by [CONTACT_12814] (straw phonation, voiced fricatives, nasals), oral 
oscillatory (lip buzzes, tongue trills, raspberries) or transitory phonation (plosives 
and glides). Straw phonation therapy, one of the most utilized SOVT methods, was 
first proposed in [ADDRESS_993974] demonstrated

Our group recently developed a semi-occluded facemask for use in patients with

sessions. 
Patients will be given a facemask with a semi-occlusion (SOMask) for use in clinic

participation in this research, and that all research is voluntary. Potential subjects will 
also be informed that they do not have to decide to participate immediately. But we 
ask that they make the decision prior to receiving any voice therapy sessions so as 
not to confound the study results. 
Ultimately, written informed consent will be obtained from the subject by a co­

Individuals will be permitted to take as much time as they need to decide. The only 
stipulation is that they may not have any "traditional" voice therapy sessions after 
determination of eligibility and enrolling into the study as this will confound the

Data Safety and Monitoring 
, * Describe your plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both 
harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe. The plan 
might include establishing a data monitoring committee and a plan for 
reporting data monitoring committee findings to the IRB and the sponsor: 
The data and safety monitoring plan for this study will involve quarterly meetings 
with the Pl, Co-Investigators and the staff involved to discuss: the integrity and 
confidentiality issues, to monitor data collection and recruitment, and to ensure 
compliance with protocol procedures. A review of research study procedures 
designed to protect the privacy of the research subjects and the confidentiality of 
their research data will be discussed. All breaches of confidentiality will be promptly 
reported to the IRB as well as the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_727756]. In addition, any unauthorized 
access to medical record information or unanticipated problems shall be reported to 
the IRB. A report will be submitted during the course of the IRB renewal of the study. 
*Describe your plan for sharing data and/or specimens:
This sharing will only occur once the appropriate agreements are executed if 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_52933]. 
Individuals from both Emory University and Bloomsburg University may be involved 
in the overall conduct of this study. Information shared with Emory and Bloomsburg 
University will be shared in a de-identified manner. 
If any research data is collected, stored, or shared in a paper format, address 
what precautions will be used to maintain the confidentiality of the data: 
Confidentiality will be maintained as per the usual methods in the Dept. of 
Otolaryngology. Any paper documentation will be maintained in locked file cabinets 
within the locked offices of the Department of Otolaryngology.

Confidentiality will be maintained as per the usual methods in the Dept. of 
Otolaryng ology. All electronic subject information will be stored on password 
protected, restricted access servers. Any paper documentation will be maintained in 
locked file cabinets within the locked offices of the Department of Otolaryngology.

Wearing of the partially occluded mask could potentially be uncomfortable, 
emotionally for some individuals. The mask is not "fixed" to the individual's face, and 
can be removed by [CONTACT_649906]. The subject is in control of holding the 
mask over their nose and mouth. In the event of skin allergy/irritation, mask use may 
need to be discontinued.

All study related procedures will be performed in private rooms as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_727759]. Information being collected will be limited to the minimum 
necessary to achieve the specific aims in this study and to lay the groundwork for 
future research in this area. 
What steps will be taken in the event that a clinically significant, unexpected 
disease or condition is identified during the conduct of the study: 
All participants will be under the clinical care of physicians in the Department of 
Otolaryngology. Usual clinical practice procedures will be maintained. 
Describe the potential benefit that individual subjects may experience from 
taking part in the research or indicate if there is no direct benefit. Do not 
include benefits to society or others: 
Subjects may actually receive direct benefit in the form of a more rapid recovery 
from their voice disorder than may have been received by [CONTACT_727777]. It is our hypothesis that all subjects will benefit in this way. 
, Do you anticipate any circumstances under which subjects might be 
withdrawn from the research without their consent? 
eves QNo 
*Describe the circumstances and any procedures for orderly termination:
It is possible that individuals may be removed from participation due to a change in
their diagnosis or a change in their treatment plan is recommended.
Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data 
collection and data already collected: 
Depending on the circumstances, individuals may be removed from participation 
and directed to alternative methods of treatment if warranted.

 Confidential / Trade Secret  Page 16 of 25 
Flexibility in Dose Adjustment : 
If an intolerable dose is identified (based on one of the above 5 criteria), a lower dose  may be 
evaluated  as proposed by [CONTACT_12217] ( Figure 1). This lower dose may be a repeat of the prior 
lower dose cohort or an intermediary dose between the intolerable dose and prior lower dose 
cohort.  If the dose is an intermediary dose, a sentinel group consisting of 2 subjects  (1 active: 
1 placebo) will be dosed first. The SRC will review all available safety data of the prior sentinel 
group through at least Day [ADDRESS_242084] -operatively, and 4 additional subjects (3 active: 1 placebo) 
will be dosed  upon approval . 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
Screening : 
Written informed consent form (ICF), demographics  and baseline characteristics , 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical/surgical history, height, weight and BMI, complete 
physical and focused neurological examinations, prior and concomitant medications, 12 -lead 
ECG, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hematology, urinalysis), immunogenicity sample collection, screens for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B and C, screens for alcohol and drugs of abuse, serum pregnancy test, strength testing and pain assessment (NPRS -A) with  PM activation , and pulmonary function test (PFT; 
SVC, FVC and FEV1).  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include collection and evaluation of TEAEs , physical and focused 
neurologic examinations  (for potential SOT events), prior and concomitant medications, 
triplicate  ECG, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hematology, and 
urinalysis), medical/surgical history, serum/urine pregnancy  
 Safety assessments will also include collection and evaluatio n of TE AEs of 
Special Interest  including post -operative dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, pneumonia, 
atelectasis, and fever, which  will be closely monitored.

General Statistical Considerations:  
The final analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed Day 2 9 or exited early 
from the study.  
Study Populations  
The m odified Intent to T reat (mITT) population will includ e all randomized patients who 
receive study drug . All efficacy analyses will be performed using this population. Analyses will 
be performed on subjects using their randomized treatment group.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population will include all subjects in the mITT population with no majo r 
protocol violations. The primary efficacy variable will also be analyzed using this population.  
The Safety population will include all subjects exposed to any amount of study drug.  All safety 
analys es will be performed using the safety population.  
Sample Size  
Subjects in each cohort will be randomly allocated to receive either EB -001 or placebo. 
 
 
 
 
 
All placebo subjects will be pooled  for statistical analyses. All statistical analysis will be 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will undergo formal sign off prior to 
database lock.

a true frequency of 50% will be detectable with a 9 3.8% probability within a given cohort. 
Combined across all 6 cohorts, with up to 48  subjects receiving EB -001, an AE that o ccurs with 
a true frequency of 10% will be detectable with a 9 9.4% probability.  The probability of

Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized.  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_202870], TEAEs, and serious 
adverse events. Other safety parameters (clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG

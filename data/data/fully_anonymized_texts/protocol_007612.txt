  Page 4 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 Insomnia is a common sequela of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment (ALL), with significant health consequences . Prior literature demonstrates  that effective methods of dealing 
with medically disrupted sleep include
1: (1) parent education (teaching parents about sleep norms 
in children with cancer and setting appropriate expectations)2; (2) extinction (addressing 
problematic sleep onset associations)3; (3) bedtime fading (increasing sleep drive)4; (4) stimulus 
control (leaving the bed if not asleep)4; (5) positive routines (calming activities that cue sleep)5; 
and (6) sleep hygiene (improving sleep environment)6. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_375060], this forward-thinking approach has not been taken with ALL populations.  We conducted a mixed methods study (DFCI 21 -005) of 15 parents of children  in active ALL 
maintenance therapy to elicit stakeholder perspectives on optimal sleep interventions to prevent insomnia. Parents thematically emphasized t hat they felt un prepared for the extent of sleep 
disruptions that their child would experience, and how to communicate this with their oncology team . Parents voiced a strong desire for more information to learn more about sleep in ALL 
patients, and to be able to access the information from home, without the need for additional medical/psychological appointments.  The information collected from these qualitative data, informed the development of a stake-holder informed program called Sleep ALL Night. The program will be comprised of a sleep action plan, coupled with a psychoeducational website that  provides families with information 
critical to understanding their child’s sleep, as well as evidence- based s trategies to reduce the 
impact of ALL treatment on sleep . 
 We will conduct a single- arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_375061] a cohort of children with ALL receiving maintenance therapy on or as per Dana -
Farber ALL Consortium trials. We are interested in study acceptability  both prior to, and 
following the program period, defined as the extent to which people receiving a healthcare intervention consider it appropriate based on their anticipated and experiential response to the program.
[ADDRESS_469497] to evaluate efficacy in insomnia prevention among this highly vulnerable patient population.   1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
1. To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the Sleep ALL Night intervention in a single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] N=30 pediatric patients with ALL.  
a. Acceptab ility will be defined as  (1) ≥30% of eligible participants who are 
approached agree to participate, and (2) participants report an average score ≥ 4 
(“Agree”) on the Acceptability of Intervention Measure scale.
8 
b. Feasibility will be defined as : (1) ≥ 70% of participants report reviewing the study 
Protocol Version Date:  11/27/2023  
  Page 5 action plan , (2) ≥ 50% of participants report accessing the psychoeducational 
website, and (3) ≥ 80% of participants complete the Intervention Assessment . 
2. To refine the program materials based on participant feedback.  
3. To collect preliminary data assessing the impact of the program on increasing frequency 
of sleep health conversations during Jimmy Fund Clinic  medical appointments based on 
electronic medical record review of clinic  notes and parent survey response. 
 2. BACKGROUND 
 2.1 Study Disease(s)  
Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  
 3. PARTICIPANT  SELECTION  
 Children with a diagnosis of de novo ALL receiving treatment in the Maintenance phase of therapy either on or as per DFCI 16- 001 will serve as the population for study recruitment.  
Selection of participants from this cohort will ensure standardized chemotherapy exposures and medical management by [CONTACT_375074]. We will recruit across low-risk, high-risk and very high- risk groups as dexamethasone (a chemotherapy known to impact sleep) dosing on or as per  
DFCI 16 -001 is identical across risk groups in the maintenance phase of therapy (6 mg/m
2 BID 
administered in 5 -day pulses at the start of each 3 -week chemotherapy cycle). Given known 
disparities in disordered sleep due to low socioeconomic status and its associated adverse social determinants of health, we will utilize available data from the open sociodemographic banking protocol DFCI 19-796 and from DFCI 16-001 embedded HMH study to ensure appropriate representation of children from low socioeconomic status homes. Annually, ~50 children are diagnosed with de novo ALL at DFCI, of whom 30% live in low -SES households, and we plan 
to recruit a population representative of these local data . Patients in the maintenance phase of 
therapy will be recruited for study participation as per the below outlined eligibility criteria.  
 3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 Eligibility will be determined as follows: 
1. Patient in the Maintenance Phase of therapy on or as per DFCI 16-[ADDRESS_469498] two cycles of maintenance therapy to allow adequate recovery from the more intensive Consolidation phase.  
2. English or Spanish speaking child and primary caregiver (parent/guardian). 
3. Child aged 4-12 years. 
 3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Primary team declines permission to approach.  
2. Children with critical illness (defined as ICU admission)  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Children and Minorities  
 Both male and female children of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this study. This study focuses on children with ALL  with their parents as survey informants. Surveys are 
Protocol Version Date:  11/27/2023  
  Page 6 available in both English and Spanish. This study will enroll racial and ethnic minorities in a 
manner that is reflective of the proportion of racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with childhood ALL  at DFCI . This study does not focus on any race, ethnicity, or sex . No potential 
research subjects will be excluded from enrollment based on race, ethnic origin, or sex ; nor will 
any race, ethnicity or sex  be preferentially enrolled. All children and their families receiving 
chemotherapy on or as per DFCI 16-001 who meet the inclusion criteria will be considered eligible for participation.  
 3.4 Planned enrollment  
 The overall study will enroll a total of 30 pediatric patients with ALL being treated on or as per DFCI 16 -001 over 1-year. Eligible families will be offered an opportunity to consent/assent to 
enrollment by [CONTACT_375075][INVESTIGATOR_375062]. This strategy removes recruitment burden from busy clinical staff and has been successfully implemented in prior insomnia treatment research conducted by [CONTACT_79086] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zhou
9. We will recruit a patient sample representative of the racial, ethnic,  and 
socioeconomic diversity of our patient population to ensure data from this study are generalizable. This will be operationalized by [CONTACT_375076]-reported sociodemographic data  from the currently open sociodemographic banking protocol DFCI 19-796 and from the DFCI 16-001 embedded HMH study as part of our screening processes.  Should COVID-19 restrictions limit in -person clinic visits during the funding period, we will implement a remote recruitment 
and consent strategy involving phone calls/emails after medical appointments in our center successful in previous studies by [CONTACT_79086] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zhou (NCT #03613519).  3.[ADDRESS_469499] for other protocols at DFCI ( e.g., 17-515, 
17-402) in order to identify potentially eligible participants  for recruitment purposes. These 
procedures have been developed in consultation with multiple  disease centers and have proven to 
be effective and non -burdensome for clinicians and patients.  Study investigators will collaborate 
with clinicians in the Jimmy Fund C linic at Dana -Farber Cancer Institute in order to identify and 
recruit eligible participants. Recruitment materials and a study information sheet can be found in Appendix D, E and F . After getting permission to approach the subject from their oncology 
provider, subjects will be approached, screened for eligibility, and recruited by a member of the study staff. This may  occur in-person during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375063] a scheduled clinic visit,  or 
alternatively, via  telephone, videoconference, email, or mail, as some medical visits are currently 
conducted as telehealth visits. These “remote” potentia l participants will receive the Study 
Information Sheet by [CONTACT_172932].  
 
Protocol Version Date:  11/27/2023  
  Page 7 Informed Consent : We are requesting a Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent for this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], as it is a minimal risk study involving procedures common in routine clinical and 
non-clinical practice for which signed consent is generally not required outside of the research 
context. All elements of informed consent will be provided verbally prior to study enrollment by [CONTACT_375077] (Verbal Informed Consent)) and will be  
provided to families.   R
ecruitment and Consent methods will include both in- person and remote options:  
 In-p
erson:  
Following provider permission to approach, e ligible parents/guardians will be approached by [CONTACT_375078]. Study staff will offer discussion in a private setting (e.g., 
consult room) and explain details of the study including all elements of informed consent including study procedures, study risks and benefits and study goals and methods. The voluntary nature of participation will be highlighted. If, after being introduced to the study and having had the opportunity to ask questions, parent/guardians are willing to part icipate, they will be asked to 
verbally communicate their intent to participate which will be documented by [CONTACT_464]. Participants ages 10 -12 years will provide verbal assent with the parent/guardian present, and the 
parent/guardian will provide verbal consent on the child’s behalf. Records of all instances of verbal consent/assent, including date, will be stored in a secure study database managed by [CONTACT_3476]. Parent/guardians will be provided with a copy of the Sleep Study Information Sheet for their reference. The patient’s designated Oncology Nurse Navigator (ONN) will be informed of the consent. During the ONN’s visit with the patient and guardian, the family will be provided with the sleep action plan  and introduced to its use (Appendix C). The sleep action plan will be 
available in both English and Spanish.  
Remote:  
In addition to in -person recruitment, study staff may also conduct the consent process remotely. For 
these procedures, email addresses, mailing addresses, and phone numbers will be obtained from the patient’s medical record. Eligible participants will be emailed a  Sleep Study Invitation  (see Appendix 
D) that includes the following:   
• An invitation letter, that will explain the purpose and characteristics of the study and an 
opt out message stating they decline to participate at this time  
 S
tudy staff will then follow up with a phone call after a few days to ensure that the documents have 
been received and gauge the family’s interest in learning more. We will attempt to contact [CONTACT_476] a 
maximum of three times. No phone messages with the full name [CONTACT_375085]- Farber Cancer Institute 
will be used. The phone call will give the parents the opportunity to opt-out or hear additional information about the study.  If the family expresses interest in participating, the study staff  will provide details on the study, walk 
through the Sleep Study Information Sheet to ensure that all elements of informed consent are 
provided, and offer the family the opportunity to ask questions. If the parent and child (when applicable by [CONTACT_654]) decide to participate, they will provide verbal consent/assent in place of written documentation of informed consent. Children ages 10 -12 years  will provide verbal assent with the parent present, a nd 
Protocol Version Date:  11/27/2023  
  Page 8 the parent will provide verbal consent on behalf of the child.  
 During the patient’s next ONN visit, the family will be provided with the sleep action plan.   We request a waiver of documentation of consent/assent for parents and children based on the 
following considerations: (i) participating in the study constitutes “no more than minimal risk”; (ii) the rights and welfare of the subjects will not be adversely affected, since parents and children will be given all elements of informed consent both in writing and verbally; (iii) increased study feasibility: we would like to minimize the burden that may result from signing a consent form . 
 3.6 HIPAA Authorization  
 A partial HIPAA Waiver of Authorization will be requested to enable thorough screening for eligibility. This process involves no more than a minimal risk to subjects’ privacy because identifiers will be collected in a secure way and destroyed after the study is closed. In addition, the protected health information collected will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity other than the research team, except as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Because we aim to enroll participants within a specific window of maintenance therapy, we have a relatively narrow timeframe in which to identify eligible participants. Without such a waiver, we would have to rely solely on provider- generated referrals or patient and parent self -referral, which would add an 
undue burden to pediatric hematology/oncology providers and potentially lead to such slow participant accrual that the research would be rendered infeasible. Alternatively, requesting consent from each potential study participant prior to review of preliminary eligibility would result in an unnecessary burden for families.  We will r eview the  participant’s medical records for documentation of any discussion related to 
sleep during routine (non-emergency) JFC clinic appointments for the 12-week period prior to and following the ONN baseline visit at study. To obtain permission for the medical record abstraction portion of the study, we will have participants provide a signature [CONTACT_375086]. As we wish for documented consent to be waived, the HIPAA authorization form will be a standalone documen t. Signed HIPAA authorization will be obtained in person alongside 
the verbal consent.  3.[ADDRESS_469500] of their time participating in the baseline and i ntervention 
assessment  ($[ADDRESS_469501] at baseline and a $[ADDRESS_469502] for the intervention assessment) . Due to 
the relatively low -participant burden, modest remuneration, and patient- centered nature of the 
intervention we do not anti cipate problems with recruitment and retention.

and the overall website monitoring that will occur from Week 1 up until Week 12 (end of study).   The sleep action plan will be presented on a single page (Appendix B), resembling action plans that are commonly implemented for children with other chronic medical conditions (e.g., asthma) .
15 The action plan is separated into three ‘zones’: 1) a green zone, indicating that the 
child is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_102641], reminding families that sleep is something to monitor; 2) a yellow zone, indicating that the child’s sleep is worsening, encouraging families to begin tracking their child’s sleep; and 3) a red zone, indicating that the child’s sleep is problematic, providing concrete steps to take in order to initiate further evaluation and any necessary treatment(s) . 
 ONNs will introduce families to the sleep action plan  immediately after study enrollment.  
Spanish interpreters will aid ONNs in explaining the sleep action plan to Spanish speaking caregivers.  If this is not a feasible time to meet with the families, ( i.e., someone has to leave right 
after enrollment) , the study team will coordinate a time for the  family meet with the ONN at the 
time of their next in person visit . ONNs will  explain that if they are interested in further 
information regarding their child’s sleep, that they should review the intervention website. On

  Page 10 the website, families  will be provided with comprehensive information on how to successfully 
navigate the many potential disruptors of their child’s sleep as they complete maintenance 
therapy. Feedback will be solicited through an  Intervention survey (administered at Week -3) 
focused on the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention materials and delivery format  for a 
family of a child with cancer.  These materials are  based on the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine’s clinical guidelines for managing disordered sleep , and child and family feedback that 
was provided during Phase [ADDRESS_469505]. Data collection will occur over 3 months via the intervention website and during the intervention survey (administered at Week-3). T o maximize 
data collection, families will preferably complete the intervention survey (administered at Week-3) in-person via REDCap  or paper/pencil. However, surveys may also be completed using 
alternative methods, including, but not limited to, REDCap link texted/emailed to participants and phone/Zoom administration (read aloud by [CONTACT_375079]). Reminders to complete the survey will be sent as needed via various methods, including, but not 
limited to, emails, phone calls, and text messages . An Amazon gift card will also be sent to 
families  as modest remuneration for their time completing the survey .

 7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
If families choose to implement behavioral strategies to try and improve their child’s sleep, they may encounter brief periods of resistance from their child, as well as a brief period (<2 weeks) of further sleep disruption. This can create increased stress for families. However, the strategies described in the program materials are all evidence -based strategies that are commonly used in 
pediatric sleep centers to help children improve their sleep in the long-term, recognizing that there may be short -term c hallenges. In addition, t here is a theoretical possibility of anxiety or 
emotional distress as a result of reviewing materials that discuss a common side effect of maintenance therapy (sleep disturbance). The emotional risk of anxiety as a result of discussing this topic is expected to be minimal based on data from prior qualitative research conducted with parents of pediatric cancer patients. Specifically, prior work on this topic has revealed that parents are often engaged in discussing this subject because they feel as though their experiences can help inform care for other parents who are going through the experience of having a child be diagnosed with cancer, and do not report significant stress or anxiety as a result of participation.  8.

 All information collected for research purposes will be de-identified prior to analysis. Identifying information will include data (names, addresses, phone numbers, emails) necessary to identify subjects initially to ask for consent as well as to contact [CONTACT_20687] -up survey administration if 
necessary, child’s demographic and disease information. The data will be coded, databases secured with a password, and contact [CONTACT_375080] a separate database accessible only to the study team, which has undergone HIPAA Certification  
and the training mandated by [CONTACT_1201]. Study databases will not contain identifying information, and will be linked to identifying information by a unique study ID. A separate password protected key file containing the link between identifying information and research data will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_375066]. We have extensive experience in maintaining confidentiality utilizing these methods.  
 All survey data will be stored in institutionally coordinated databases, including Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and Excel. REDCap offers a secure web  
application. A tracking log will also be kept as an Excel spreadsheet. These spreadsheets will be located on HIPAA-compliant DF/HCC servers. Physical study documents (i.e. paper surveys) will be stored in locked cabinets, and will only be identified by [CONTACT_40337]. Study data will be entered, stored, and managed in a password-protected database structured for this study on a secured server. Data will be verified both at point-of-entry and subsequently by a series of range checks, logical between -items checks, and outlier checks.  
 Safety Monitoring: There are no physical risks to this study. While extremely unlikely, any serious event (SAE), defined as an adverse event that results in death, is life threatening, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or results in another important medical eve nt, will be reported to the IRB and

 “We want families to talk with us as soon as they think their child’s sleep  is in the yellow zone or 
worse . It doesn’t necessarily mean that anything needs to be done, but it means that now your 
child’s medical team will keep sleep at the top of their mind in case we need to do something differently to help them sleep and feel better. Does this make sense?”

Tap this link and it will take you to our special website. I suggest that you take a look at this 
website  in the next few days, even if sleep is going well for your family. It provides a lot of 
really good information about what is normal for a child’s sleep, what issues to look out for, and 
tips and strategies that can help your family deal with  any sleep issues.”

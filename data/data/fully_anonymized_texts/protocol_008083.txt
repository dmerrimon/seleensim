1.0  Objectives / Specific Aims  
 
The primary goal of the study is to determine whether or not 0.05 mg of intrathecal morphine is 
non-inferior to 0.1 mg of intrathecal morphine in providing anal gesia for patients undergoing 
cesarean section at MUSC in the setting of multimodal pain relief strategies.   
 
2.0 Background  
 
There is established efficacy for intrathecal (IT) morphine for postoperative pain control following 
cesarean section; however, the ideal dose of IT morphine in the setting of multimodal analgesia 
remains unclear.  The American Society of Anesthesiologists  recommends the intrathecal 
administration of preservative -free morphine for patients undergoing cesarean section to provide 
up to 24 hours of pain relief. [1] The ideal dose of spi[INVESTIGATOR_444711] n opi[INVESTIGATOR_444712], nausea, vomiting, and in 
rare cases, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. [2]   
 
Several dose -response studies of IT morphine have been performed in the last fifteen years, but 
these did not include other forms of adjuvant analgesia.  A 1999 study compared a wide range 
of IT morphine dosages (0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 , or 0.5 mg) and assessed for 
pain control as well as side effects.  This study concluded that doses of more than 0.[ADDRESS_565577] 
profile. [3]  Wong, et al. demonstrate d that while IT morphine 0.2mg provided better pain control 
than lower doses, nausea was increased. [4]  Girgin et al. concluded that the dose of 0.1 mg IT 
morphine produces analgesia comparable with doses as high as 0.4 mg, with significantly less 
pruritu s.[5]  Sultan et al. compared low vs high dose IT morphine and demonstrated a greater 
incidence of side effects in the high dose group.[6]  
 
A recent study by [CONTACT_289282]. examined IT morphine doses of 0.05mg, 0.1mg, and 0.2mg 
given in combination with IV ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medication, and 
demonstrated that analgesia was equivalent in all groups with a decrease in prur itus in the 
0.05mg group.[7]  While this study did include an adjuvant analgesic, it did not incorporate the 
use of acetaminophen, a medication commonly used for postoperative pain due to its narcotic 
sparing properties.  
 
Version 5; 02-28-[ADDRESS_565578] 24 hours following cesarean 
sections at MU SC includes scheduled administration of oral acetaminophen and IV ketorolac.   
Preliminary data from 59 patients here at MUSC has revealed that reducing the dose of IT 
morphine to 0.1mg results in equivalent pain control (time to first rescue dose of IV morphine) 
compared to IT morphine 0.2mg when given i n conjunction with standard of care pain 
medications .  Based on these findings, the current MUSC protocol is to administer 0.[ADDRESS_565579] of care pain medications 
postoperatively .  Secondary outcomes will in clude: a) total opi[INVESTIGATOR_9368] 24 and 48 
hours postoperatively; b) time to first ambulation; c) VAS measurements at rest and with 
ambulation at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively; d) side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (nausea, vomiting, 
pruritus); e) overall patient satisfaction with pain control at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.  We 
hypothesize that lower doses of intrathecal morphine will provide equivalent postoperative pain 
control with a reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related side effects.   Improved patient quality m easures and 
overall improved patient satisfaction with pain control when added to this institution’s current 
standard of care is expected.  
   
 
3.0    Intervention to be studied (if applicable)  
 
Preservative -free DURAMORPH (morphine sulfate injection, USP): FDA -approved 
DURAMORPH is a systemic narcotic analgesic for administration by [CONTACT_2731], epi[INVESTIGATOR_444713]. It is used for the management of pain not responsive to non -narcot ic 
analgesics. DURAMORPH administered epi[INVESTIGATOR_444714], sensory, or sympathetic function.  
 
The rationale for using lower doses of intrathecal morphine is to reduce the side effects of the 
drug, namely pruritus and nausea, while achieving equivalent pain control.  
 
The control group for the study will receive 0.1mg IT morphine. Study groups will be randomized 
into 2 groups: 0.1mg IT morphine (control) and 0.05mg IT morphine. All pa tients will receive the 
standard of care spi[INVESTIGATOR_444715].  All patients will receive standard of care pain 
medications postoperatively .

9.0 Consent Process  
A study team member will interview and consent a potential participant of the study prior 
to elective c esarean delivery. Participants will be given time to read the informed 
consent/HIPAA and have all of their questions answered prior to enrollment. If subjects

10.0 Study Design / Methods  
Version 5; 02-28-[ADDRESS_565582] Description :  This study will be conducted as a randomized controlled single -blinded 
clinical trial with patients being randomized to receive either 0.[ADDRESS_565583] opi[INVESTIGATOR_444717].  Secondary outcomes will include 
cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_142250] (measured at 12 hour intervals for up to 48 hours), 
patient reported pain  score (on the VAS scale) over time both at rest and with ambulation, 
occurrence of side effects (nausea, vomiting, or pr uritus), and patient satisfaction.   Additional 
information collected on each participant will include maternal age, gestational age, race, weight 
at delivery, parity, whether or not the patient had a prior C -section, whether or not the patient 
received in tra-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_858],  whether or not the patient received Tylenol post -operatively, 
whether or not the patient received Toradol post -operatively,  and which opi[INVESTIGATOR_444718] -operatively .  
Statistical Analysis Plan and Sample Size Justification : 
The primary outcome of interest is time to first rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_14024].  The hypothesis of non -
inferiority for time to first rescue dose between treatment group will be evaluated using a log -
rank testing approach.  In a preliminary study based on patients undergoing C -section at MUSC, 
we found parturients receiving 0.[ADDRESS_565584] when d ecreasing the dose of intrathecal morphine to 
0.05 mg.  Additionally, the proportion of parturients requesting no opi[INVESTIGATOR_444719] 5% 
for the 0.2 mg group and 12% for the 0.1mg group.  Using a non -inferiority logrank test, a 
sample size of 200 sub jects (100 per treatment group) provides 80.0% power to detect an 
equivalence hazard ratio of 1.65 at significance level 
  = 0.[ADDRESS_565585] rate of 0.5 in the 0.1 mg intrathecal morphine group, and that the proportio n of 
subjects censored in each group is approximately 0.07.   
Secondary outcomes will include cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_142250] (measured at 12 
hour intervals for up to 48 hours), patient reported pains score (on the VAS scale) over time 
both at rest and with ambulation, occurrence of side effects (nausea, vomi ting, or pruritus), and 
patient satisfaction.   The association between treatment group with all categorical outcomes will 
be evaluated using a chi -square or Fisher’s exact test where appropriate.  Associations between 
treatment group and cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_444720] (either at rest or 
with ambulation) will be examined using a series of linear mixed models.  All mixed models will 
include fixed effects for treatment group, time, and the treatment group by [CONTACT_444725] a 
random subject effect to account for repeated measures collected on the same subject.  Various 
correlation structures will considered, and the final structure will be selected based on the model 
Version 5; 02-28-2023   
 Page 5 of 7  Akaike information criterion (AIC).  Additionally, Harrell’s rule of thumb states that 10 subjects 
per covariate are required to avoid overfitting.[8]  Thus, we will also include up to 7 additional 
covariates in order to account for potential confounders a ssociated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_444721].  All analyses will be conducted in SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Cary NC).  
We plan to enroll 118 subjects per group (236 total) to allow for 15% attrition rate.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_565586] or interview: time to first 
narcotic rescue dose, time to ambulation,  subjective pain rating using visual analogue scales 
(VAS) at [ADDRESS_565587] and with ambulation, opi[INVESTIGATOR_9368] 12, 
36, and 48 hours, overall patient satisfaction with pain control at 24 and 48 hours,  administration 
of Tylenol and Toradol,  and presence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9365] (nausea, vomiting, and pruritus).  
 
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a randomized numerical identifier for the 
remainder of the study.  This number will be used to label charts and paperwork 
associated with the subject.  An electronic enrollment log will link patient name [CONTACT_444728].  All paper information will be kept in a locked cabinet in a 
locked office.  All electronic data will be kept on MUSC's password protected server.  
 
12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects (if applicable)  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_444726] a annually basis.  The committee is 
comprised of several attendin g anesthesiologists, the chairma n of anesthesiology , and an 
emeritus dean of medicine. Any adverse events will be reported to MUSC's IRB per protocol 
and will be evaluated by [CONTACT_942].  The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the 
ideal dose of intrathecal morphine for post cesarean pain.   
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects (if applicable)  
Circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the research without their consent 
include conversion to general anesthesia due to failed spi[INVESTIGATOR_444722]/maternal distress or 
unrecognized allergy/intolerance to morphine, ketorolac, or acetaminoph en. 
If patients voluntarily withdraw from the research study, they will receive our institutional 
standard of care for perioperative pain management.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_565588], namely suboptimal pain control requiring additional dosing of IV 
morphine, does not pose long term negative consequences.  Patients will receive IV pain 
medications as needed to achieve adequate pain relief.  
 
Morphine is an FDA approved medication; however, too much morphine can lead to sedation 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].  Patients will be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry while on 
the ward.   
Version 5; 02-28-2023   
 Page 6 of 7    
Allergic reaction to morphine is possible.  Any reaction to the study drug will be treated per 
MUSC protocol for drug reactions and the medication will be discontinued. Any potential 
participant with an allergy to morphine will be excluded from the study.  
 
If any of the listed skin reactions (please see E1) occur the study drug will be stopped 
immediately.  
 
Risks include allergic reaction, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], pruritus, nausea, vomiting, constipation, 
and skin reactions.  
 
Symptoms of allergic reaction to morphine may include: hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling 
of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.  
 
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality.   
 
Alternative: Patients may choose to not participate or withdraw from the study at any 
time.

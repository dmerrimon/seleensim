TITLE: Cessation in Non -Daily Smokers: A RCT of NRT With E cological Momentary Assessment  
NCT Protocol #:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date  Submitted : 01/08/2019  
 
Outcomes  
 
Outcomes are assessed and analyzed in three ways:  
 
The primary outcome is 6 -month continuous abstinence, allowing for a 2 -week 'grace period' following 
the start of treatment and quit date.1,2  Participants are considered to meet the criterion if they claim 
abstinence throughout the period, demonstrate CO levels ≤3 ppm each time they are tested, and further 
demonstrate urinary cotinine levels ≤25 ng/ml when tested at 3 and/or [ADDRESS_494063] for assessing smoking cessation outcomes. However, Hedeker, Mermelstein & Demitras3 have 
shown that imposing this very strong ass umption is not necessarily conservative.  Following procedures 
recommended by [CONTACT_393742], sensitivity analyses will consider a range of assumptions about the 
relationship between loss to follow -up and smoking.  
 
Complementing the assessment of continuous  abstinence, we will also assess 14 -day point -prevalence 
abstinence at each time -point throughout the study, specifically at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. (Analysis of 
ad libitum smoking patterns among ITS4 indicates that 7 day periods of abstinence are relat ively common, 
whereas 14 -day periods are not.)  Subjects will be considered abstinent if they report no smoking for 14 
days, and demonstrate exhaled CO levels ≤[ADDRESS_494064] 7 consecutive days of abstinence.  A lapse is defined as any occasion of 
smoking after abstinence is achieved, and a relapse is defined as reaching a rate of cigarette consumption 
≥50% of the subject's baseline level.   (Previous definitions of relapse6 have been based on consecutive 
days smoking, but such definitions are unsuitable for ITS, who might not meet such criteria even when 
smoking ad libitum at baseline.)  
 
Moderators  
 
Three individual difference variables are h ypothesized to potentially moderate the treatment effects: 
Degree of dependence will be expressed as a dichotomy, distinguishing subjects with an FTND7 score of 
0 from those with higher scores. Previous research has indicated that this distinction is behav iorally 
relevant among ITS.8  Self-reported history of previous daily smoking (for at least 6 months) has 
previously been shown to help predict ITS behavior9 and smoking cessation outcome.[ADDRESS_494065] which to assess the 
amount of gum use; we instead capture gum use i n strata based on the observed range of gum use in the 
study (strata: 0 pi[INVESTIGATOR_393741], <0.5/day, 0.5 -1.0/day, >1/day).  
 
Nollen et al.14 are conducting a  trial of nicotine replacement focused exclusively on African -American 
individuals.   Anticipating the value of comparing outcomes across studies, an exploratory analysis will 
examine outcomes among African -American participants in the present study, also examining whether 
race moderates outcomes.  
 
Analysis  
 
Continuous abstinence will be assessed by [CONTACT_51621], with treatment as the primary predictor.  
Moderation will be tested by [CONTACT_393743]: 
dependence, history of daily smoking, and gum use.  Sensitivity analyses will test a range of hypothesized 
relationships between missing data and smoking,[ADDRESS_494066] baseline differences between treatment groups in variables that also correlate with outcomes, these 
will be included as covariates.   
 
Point -prevalen ce abstinence over multiple time -points will be tested using multi -level generalized mixed 
models, with random effects (SAS PROC GLIMMIX), which allow for multiple correlated dependent 
variables per subject.  Abstinence at 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 weeks will be entered; parameters will include 
assessment time (with both linear and quadratic expressions) and treatment assignment and their 
interaction.  The resulting analysis essentially considers the 'area under the curve' for abstinence -by-time.  
Missing assessme nts will not be imputed; GLIMMIX allows for incomplete data across time and uses full 
maximum likelihood estimation.  This allows for missing at random (MAR) in which the missingness can 
be related to model covariates as well as observed values of the depe ndent variable.15  The three pre -
specified moderators and their interaction with treatment and time will also be considered, and baseline 
differences will be included as covariates.   
 
Achievement of cessation milestones (abstinence, lapsing, and relapsing)  during the primary treatment 
period of 6 weeks will be analyzed using event -history ('survival') analyses using Cox proportional 
hazards models. (If the assumption of proportionality is untenable, other survival analysis models will be 
applied.)  Time to achieve cessation will be assessed from the first treatment day; time to lapse is assessed 
from the first day of abstinence, among those who achieve abstinence; time to relapse is assessed from the 
day of first lapse, among those who lapse.  For subjects w ho are not observed to reach a milestone (e.g., 
subjects who do not achieve abstinence by [CONTACT_393744]), time will be censored as 
of the last day of observation.  Moderators and potential group -assignment confounds will be considered 
as above.

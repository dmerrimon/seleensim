SYNOPSIS  
Title:  
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Parallel -Group, Vehicle -Controlled Study of 
the Safety and Efficacy of DFD -03 Lotion in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris for 
12 Weeks  
Sponsor:    [CONTACT_23015]’s Laboratories, Ltd  
  8-2-337, Road No. 3  
  Banjara Hills  
 Hyderabad – 500034, Telangana, India  
Study Centers:      25 to 35 sites  Number of Subjects:  A pproximately  550  
Study Period:  12 weeks  Clinical Phase: Phase 3   
Objective:  
The objective s of this study are  to compare the efficacy and safety of DFD -[ADDRESS_126006] s with  acne vulgaris after 12  weeks of topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786].  
Methods:   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, vehicle -controlled study .  
Subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized to either of the two arms 
in a 1:1 ratio:  
Arm 1: DFD -03 Lotion  
Arm 2: Vehicle Lotion   
Enrollment of subjects with mild acne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be  restricted to no more 
than 20% of total enrollment at that site. Subjects with acne lesions of any severity on the chest 
and/or back (including shoulders)  may be enrolled provided they have mild to moderate acne on 
the face. During the 12- week treatment period subjects will use the study product  twice daily 
with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects will be instru cted to treat the entire 
face (and chest  and/or back  including shoulders , if applicable ). The i nvestigator will assess 
efficacy by [CONTACT_112948] ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA 5- point  scale) and by 
[CONTACT_112949]- inflammatory  lesions on the face at Baseline and  
Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Lesion counts will also be done for the chest  and/or back  (including 
shoul ders) , where  applicable . The IGA should always be done prior to lesion counts. 
 Safety assessments will include the i nvestigator’s assessment of local cutaneous t olerance of the 
treated skin ( dryness , non- lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and itching ; assessed 
separately on the chest  and/ or back  including shoulders  (if applicable ), vital signs (blood 
pressure and pulse rate) , and adverse events  (AEs) . Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at 
Baseline and at every visit through Week  12 for all female subjects.  A physical examination will 
be performed at the Baseline Visit.

Version 7.0 (Amendment 06)  
DFD -[ADDRESS_126014], Dose and Mode of Administration:  
DFD -03 Lotion (0.1% tazarotene)  
 Subjects will apply a quarter (U.S coin) size amount of the study product all over the moistened face and rub  it into the skin until foamy . Care should be taken to avoid the areas around the 
eyes, mouth, and nostrils. An additional 1- [ADDRESS_126015] may be 
used over other affected areas  (chest and/or back, including shoulders) . After being left on for [ADDRESS_126016] by [CONTACT_112951] 
30 seconds. This procedure will be followed twice daily , in the morning and at bedtime, 
approximately 12 hours apart.  
Duration of Treatment and Study:  
Subjects will treat the entire face, including the nose (and chest and/or back , including 
shoulders , if applicable) twice daily for 12 weeks. The total study duration including the 
screening period will be approximately 12  to 20 weeks.    
 
Reference and Control Products, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Vehicle:  DFD -03 Vehicle Lotion (0% tazarotene)  
 The control product will be applied similarly to the study product as described above.  
 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety criteria:  
The primary safety endpoint will be treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Other s afety 
variables include  local cutaneou s tolerance evaluation ( dryness , non- lesional erythema, peeling, 
stinging, burning, and itching ) and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) .   
Efficacy criteria:  
The co -primary endpoints are:  
• The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and pustules)  lesion counts on the face  
• The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non- inflammatory  (open and 
closed comedones) lesion counts  on the face  
• Proportion of subject s with a clinical response of “success” at W eek 12  for lesions on the 
face. Success based on IGA is defined as an IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (Almost clear)  
at Week [ADDRESS_126017] a 2 -grade reduction from B aseline.   
 
The secondary endpoints  are: 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory l esion counts on the face .  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 06)  
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-005 
Page  8 of 60 
The exploratory e ndpoints  are: 
1. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the face.  
2. Absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory, non- inflammatory and total lesion 
counts on the face at Weeks [ADDRESS_126018] a 2- grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5. Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16 years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8 and 12. 
6. Change from Baseline in DLQI score in subjects >[ADDRESS_126019] and/or back  including shoulders  (in relevant subjects ) at Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  
8. Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the chest and/or  back  (including 
shoulders) . 
9. Proportion of subjects with at least a 2- grade improvement from Baseline in the SGA  at 
Week 12.  
10. Change from Baseline in CADI score at Weeks 4 , 8 and 12. 
 
If the statistical analysis for all the co -primary endpoints achieves p<0.05, statistical analysis for 
the secondary endpoints will use a sequential  approach according to a pre -specified order: 
percent change in inflammatory lesion counts  on the face, and then p ercent change in non-
inflammatory lesion counts  on the face. If p<0.05 is achieved for a higher ranking secondary 
variable, then success will be declared for the variable, and statistical comparisons will be 
performed for the lower ranking variable. If p<0.05 is not achieved for a higher ranking 
variable, then statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive (non- inferential) for this 
variable and for the lower ranking secondary variable. 
The sample size was estimated based on the primary study endpoints and statistics available 
from the Summary Basis of Approval for Tazorac® (tazarotene) Gel (NDA 20 -600). The total 
sample size  of [ADDRESS_126020] 90%  based on a 2- tailed alpha of 
0.05. 
 
Approximately  550 subjects  (275 for each treatment arm)  will be randomized  and about 25 to 35 
sites will participate in the study .

1 INTRODUCTION 
Tazarotene, an acetylenic  retinoid, is a prodrug that undergoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to its active metabolite tazarotenic acid ( Chandraratna, 1996). Retinoids are a class of 
keratolytic drugs derived from retinoic acid used for the treatme nt of acne and psoriasis. Several 
synthetic retinoids have been developed for topi[INVESTIGATOR_112929].  
 
Tazarotene was initially developed in gel formulation and subsequently in cream and foam formulations. Products containing tazarotene have been proven to be effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris and psoriasis, as well as being effective in the mitigation (palliation) of facial fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper - and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and benign facial lentigines.  
 [CONTACT_23015]’ s Laboratories has developed DFD -03 Lotion, a new formulation containing 0.1% 
tazarotene for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112930]. This new product is intended to be used as a face wash twice daily. Treatment use will begin by [CONTACT_2931] a generous amount of product to moisten ed affected skin, rubbing until foamy, and then rinsing with water after 1 minute.  
 Acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodular cystic lesions) and non- inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones)  (Shalita, 
2004). The four primary factors contributing to acne are abnormal follicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_112931], hyperactivity of the sebaceous glands, proliferation of Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , 
and perifollicular inflammation.  
  Current ly available treatments for acne vulgaris include oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112932], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112933], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112934], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112935], topi[INVESTIGATOR_112936], oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775] (including tazarotene), and photot herapy.  
 Tazarotene is a well -characterized active ingredient, and many studies have been conducted on 
its pharmacology, toxicology and clinical efficacy and safety  (Fabior Prescribing Information, 
Tazorac Cream Prescribing Information ). 
 Tazarotene is characterized by [CONTACT_4760] a Category X drug, indicating that it may or can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant  (Menter, 2000 ). At least [ADDRESS_126031] become 
pregnant during clinical studies with tazarotene and all reported the birth of healthy babies, although the timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation time are unknown in these 
cases .  
 The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of DFD -03 Lotion  for topi[INVESTIGATOR_112937] 12 weeks of treatment.  
 More information about DFD -03 Lotion can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a multicenter, randomized, vehicle- controlled, double -blind, parallel -group study . 
Approximately  550 subjects with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio  to treatment with either  DFD -03 Lotion or Vehicle Lotion . Enrollment of subjects with 
mild ac ne (IGA Grade 2) at each site will be restricted to no more than 20% of total enrollment 
at that site.  During the 12 -week treatment period subjects will use the study drug twice daily 
with approximately 12 hours between applications. Subjects will be instru cted to treat the entire 
face (and chest and/or back (including shoulders) , if applicable) . The i nvestigator will assess 
efficacy by [CONTACT_112948] ’s Global Assessment scale (IGA , 5-point scale) and by 
[CONTACT_112949]- inflammatory  lesions on the face at Baseline and 
Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Lesion counts will also be done for the chest and/or back (including 
shoulders) , where applicable.  
 
The p rimary safety en dpoint will be treatment- emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) . Other s afety 
assessments will include the i nvestigator’s assessment of local cutaneous tolerance ( dryness , 
non-lesional erythema, peeling, stinging , burning, and itching ) and vital signs (blood pressure 
and pulse rate) . A physical examination will be performed at Baseline. Urine pregnancy tests 
will be performed at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12 for all female s ubjects.  
 The co -primary efficacy endpoints are:  
 
1. The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and pustules)  lesion counts  on the face    
2. The absolute change from Baseline to Week 12 in the non- inflammatory  (open and 
closed comedones) lesion counts  on the face  
3. Proportion of subject s with a clinical response of “success” at W eek 12  for lesions on the 
face. Success based on IGA is defined as an IGA score of 0 (Clear)  or 1 (Almost clear)  
at Week  [ADDRESS_126038] a 2-grade reduction from B aseline.   
 The secondary endpoints  are: 
 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts on the face  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the 
face.

is not needed for missed visits, missed applications, out -of-window visits , or missing data. 
These items will be apparen t from the missing data on the e CRF and will be identified 
programmatically during data analysis for purpos es of reporting. The s ponsor should be 
consulted before discontinuing subjects due  to protocol deviations unless safety is a concern.  
 
In addition, subjects will be provided a diary card for documenting the time and dates of  
application s. The subjects will  review the diary card with the investigator or designee at each 
visit. The number of applied and missed applic ations will be recorded on the e CRF.   
 
6.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the two  treatment groups  in a 1:1 ratio ( 275 for 
DFD -03 Lotion and 275 for Vehicle Lotion).   
 
IWRS will randomize each subject to a treatment group by [CONTACT_112963]’s IGA score in order for each site to maintain a 1:1 ratio within each IGA stratum. IWRS will assign a bottle 
(designated by a number) to be dispensed, based on the treatment assignment from the inventory available at the site. IWRS will restrict each site from enrolling no more than 20% of enrolled subjects with IGA score of 2 (mild). Th e date and time of randomization and the bottle  number 
should be entered on the eCRF.  
 The investigator shall ensure that study product s are only used by [CONTACT_112964]'s personal supervision or under the supervision of a sub- investigator responsible to 
the investigator and in accordance with the protocol.

A separate Screening Visit (Visit 1) may be performed when a wash out period is required or for 
scheduling purposes . Alternatively, Visits  [ADDRESS_126064] number, date  of visit, date of consent, reason for screen failure, and study 
status  (screen failure ) will be captured in the  eCRF  for every screen failure subject.  The 
Baseline Visit [ADDRESS_126065] who received information about the study, including signing an informed consent and possibly performing some study -related procedures , but was not 
randomized and/or did not use  study product. 
 
7.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables include age (computed from date of birth and Baseline Visit date), race, 
ethnicity , and sex. Baseline characteristics are the baseline values for the efficacy variables – 
inflammatory lesion count, non- inflammatory  lesion count , and IGA. The IGA should always be 
done prior to lesion counts.  
7.4 Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment  
The Fitzpatrick skin scale ( Fitzpatrick, 1988; Table 3) classifies a person ’s complexion and 
tolerance of sunlight. It is commonly used by [CONTACT_112967], and how likely they are to get skin cancer.  
 The Fitzpatrick Classification Scale will be performed at Day 1 (Baseline) prior to the first application of study medication and will be recorded in the subject’s source document a nd CRF.

counts.  
7.6.1 Investigator’s  Global Assessment ( IGA) of the Face  
The IGA scale to be used in the study is a measure of static evaluation of qualitative overall 
acne severity. IGA is an ordinal scale with five  severity grades (rep orted only in integers, e.g., 
0 to 4). Each grade is defined by a distinct and clinically relevant morphologic descri ption to 
minimize inter -observer variability  (Table 4) . The grades on the scale have been sufficiently 
defined to appropriately and unambiguously represent each severit y grade on the scale. The 
investigator is required to perform IGA scoring at each visit.  The IGA should always be done 
prior to lesion counts.

Enrollment of subjects with mild  acne (IGA Grade 2)  at each site will be  restricted to no more 
than 20% of total enrollment at that site; management of this requirement will be handled by [CONTACT_8784].  
 
7.6.2 Lesion Counts  of the Face  
Non-inflammatory  lesions (closed comedones and open comedones), inflammatory lesions 
(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions  (nodules and cysts)  on the face  (above the 
mandibular line), including the nose, will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Screening/ Baseline through Week 12. Non -inflammatory  lesions of acne are the open 
(blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) comedones. Closed comedones may be more difficult to detect  visually and may require stretching of the skin to aid in visualization. Inflammatory 
lesions are divided into papules, pustules, and nodules/nodulocystic lesions, depending on the severity and location of the inflammation within the dermis. Nodulocystic lesions will be 
counted separately from inflammatory lesions of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules have surrounding halos of erythema allowing for their characterization as inflammatory. Nodules are typi[INVESTIGATOR_112942]/or painful. Additionally, they are deep-seated in the skin (i.e., centered in the dermis or subcutis). Nodules have been defined as being greater than 5  mm in diameter. The borders of these lesions may be difficult to determine 
because of the associated ery thema/inflammation. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure consistent and accurate counts.

(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions  (nodules and cysts)  on the chest and /or back  
including shoulders  (if applicable) will be counted and recorded separately at each visit from 
Baseline through Week 12. Nodulocystic lesi ons will be counted separately from inflammatory 
lesions of papules and pustules. The back  area  is from most prominent cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_112943]. The chest  area is from the manubrium of the sternum superiorly to the xiphi od process  
inferiorly . The lesion types are as described above. The investigator/evaluator should use 
standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure 
consistent and accurate counts.  
7.6.5 DLQI  
The DLQI is a quality of life instrument that has ten questions addressing symptoms and 
feelings (Questions 1 and 2), daily activities (Questions 3 and 4), leisure (Questions 5 and 6), 
work and school (Question 7), personal relationships (Questions 8 and 9) , and treatment 
(Question 10). Each is rated from 0 to 3, such that the maximum score is 30. The higher the score, the mor e quality of life is impaired. The usual clinical interpretation of the total score is 
as follows:  
0 to 1 = no effect at all on subject’s life  
2 to 5 = small effect on subject’s life  
6 to 10 = moderate effect on subject’s life  
11 to 20 = very large effect on subject’s life  
21 to 30 = extremely large effect on subject’s life  
 The adult and children’s versions of the DLQI are provided in Appendix  2 and  Appendix  3, 
respectively .

The CADI is a short [ADDRESS_126072] s of 5 questions. The scoring for each question is done from 0 to 3 (a=3, b=2, c=1, d=0) . 
The CADI score is calculated by [CONTACT_37303] a possible maximum of 15 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more the quality of life is impaired.    
 The CADI questionnaire is provided in Appendix 4.  
7.7 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments include vital signs, local cutaneous tolerance evaluation of the treated skin, 
and AEs . Vital signs (blood pressure  and pulse) will be collected at each visit. A physical 
examination will be performed at Baseline (Day 1). U rine pregnancy tests for al l female subjects 
(regardless of childbearing potential)  will be conducted at Screening and Baseline (Day  1) and 
at each subsequent visit. Adverse events will be collected by [CONTACT_112969] 
(either  verbal or recorded in the subject diary ), by [CONTACT_112970] , and by 
[CONTACT_4171] (see Section  8 for details about AEs). Adverse events, whether believed by [CONTACT_112971], will be recorded on the eCRF . 
 At Visits 2 through 5 the investigator will assess local cutaneous tolerance by [CONTACT_112972]- lesional erythema, peeling , and dryness  that will be graded as 
shown below ( Table 6, Table 7, Table 8 ) and recorded on the e CRF . Assessments will be 
recorded separately for the face and (if applicable) chest and /or back  (including shoulders) . The 
investigator will also ask the subject if any stinging ( Table 9) , burning ( Table 10) , or itching  
(Table 11) has occurred on the face  (ches t and /or back  (including shoulders) , if applicable  since 
the last visit (for Visit [ADDRESS_126073] 2 weeks ). Visit [ADDRESS_126074] and/or back (including shoulders)  using the same

sensation , occurring in 10% to 30% of subjects. Adverse reactions occurring in 1%  to 5% of 
treated subject s included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging .  
 The investigator is to pay special attention at each visit to any  signs  of clinically significant 
dryness, non- lesional erythema , and peeling and report  as an AE  subsequent to the Baseline 
Visit if worse than at Baseline.  An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study product . An AE  can 
therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an exist ing sign, symptom, or 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or trial procedures, including 
injuries.    Any medical condition that is present at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and reporte d on the medical history e CRF  and should not be reported as an 
AE except for AEs  observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures performed at the 
Screening visit , which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions should not be reported as AEs. Unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions 
should be reported as AEs . The disease or condition being studied or expected progression, 
signs, or symptoms of the disease or condition being studied such as worsening of a cne should 
not be reported as an AE  unless it is more severe than expected , results in discontinuation from 
the study or requires alternat ive therapy . 
 All serious adverse events  (SAEs), all study product -related events , and all AEs leading to study 
produc t discontinuation must be followed until the clinical outcome is determined or until all 
attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted ( not recovered  is not an acceptable 
outcome  for acute conditions ). For other AEs, the status at the last visit can be entered into the

Vital Signs Variables  
 
Vital signs  (except at Visits 1 & 2)  should be reported as AEs if they are considered to be 
clinically significant, as per the Investigator’s judgment.  
 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Severity  
It is the investigator's responsibility to assess the severity of each AE . Descriptions of severity 
are as follows:  
 
1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
 
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that  normal activity is prevented. Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_126089]  (Causality)  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study product  and the 
AE. The degree of “ relatedness” of the AE  to the study product  should be described using the 
following categories:

Protocol DFD -03-CD-005 
Page  41 of 60 
 
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.). Specify if known. Or, the event is most probably  produced by [CONTACT_11259] ’s clinical state, therapeutic interv entions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
 
2. Possibly Related : The event is temporally related to study produc t use but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693]. Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
 3. Probably Related
: The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
 
4. Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have bee n produced by [CONTACT_1605] ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention , or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs immediately 
following study  product administration or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112945], or there is a 
positive reaction at  the application site.  
 
8.3.3 Seriousness  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an AE. A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any AE  occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening (subject at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  
of the outcomes listed above . Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_126090] be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. The 
minimum initial information required to be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Form is: the 
subject number, subject initials, the event, the causality, the date of the event , and the name [CONTACT_112990]. This initial report should be promptly followed up with a 
completed  Serious Adverse Event Form.

8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the stu dy, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery . The investigator 
should report the event to the s ponsor immediately (s ee contact [CONTACT_112975]) and 
complete the Pregnancy Report  Form.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_112976] 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and repo rt the outcome to the sponsor. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report  Form.  
 The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for SAEs  and should be reported as 
such: delivery complications prolonging hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death 
of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried fetus.

11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Two- sided 
hypothesis testing will be conducted for all inferential analyses using a significance level of 
0.05. Efficacy analyses performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be considered 
primary. Efficacy analyses performed using the per -protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive. Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (all subjects  who receive 
study product  and pro vide any post -baseline safety information ). Study populations are defined 
in Section  11.2. 
 A Statistical Analysis Plan, describing all statistical analyses, will be provided as a separate document prior to database lock and unblinding of the study treatments.  
11.1 Sample Size  
The sample size was estimated based on the primary study endpoints and statistics available 
from the Summary Basis of Approval for Tazorac
® (tazarotene) Gel (NDA 20 -600). The total 
sample size  of [ADDRESS_126098] 90%  based on a 2- tailed alpha of 
0.05.  Approximately 550 subjects (275 for each treatment arm) will be randomized  and about 25 to 35 
sites will participate in the study .

11.2 Analysis Data Sets  
11.2.1 Intent -to-Treat  
The ITT population will be the primary efficacy analysis data set and consists of all subjects 
who are randomized and dispensed study medication.  
 
11.2.2 Per-Protocol  
The PP population will include all subjects in the ITT population who complete the Week  12 
evaluation without any major protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that 
could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy).  
 Specifically, the PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who meet all of the 
following criteria: 
1. Subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
2. Subject did not take any prohibi ted concomitant medications during the evaluation 
period. The concomitant medication usage will be reviewed during the population determination review, remaining blinded to treatment designation, to determine prohibited medication usage that warrants exclusion from the PP population if they met the entrance criteria without any protocol violations . This review will take into 
consideration the timing, duration of treatment with the concomitant medication, and influence on the efficacy and safety assessments prior to deeming a prohibited concomitant medication as a protocol violation that warrants exclusion from PP.  
3. Completed the Week [ADDRESS_126099] 80% but no more than 120% of the expected 
applications ( 168 applications expected) during t he entire  evaluation  period .  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to documented lack of efficacy, worsening condition, or a treatment -related  AE will be included in the PP population.  
 Other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. These criteria will be documented with appropriate signature [CONTACT_112991], prior to database lock.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_126100] -
baseline safety  information  will be included in the safety population. No imputation will be 
made for missing safety data.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 06)  
DFD -[ADDRESS_126101] demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_112980], Saf ety, and PP populations.  
 
11.4 Efficacy Analyses   
Efficacy summaries will be provided for both the ITT and PP populations . 
 11.4.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The three co -primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed as follows on the ITT population:  
• IGA success at Week  12 (an IGA score of 0  (Clear) or 1  (almost clear)  with at least a 2 -
grade reduction from baseline) – will be  analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test for general association with treatment, stratified by [CONTACT_3725]/analysis center and 
baseline IGA.   Homogeneity of treatment effect across sites / analysis centers will be 
assessed at the 0.[ADDRESS_126102].  
• Change in inflammatory lesion counts on the face from baseline to Week 12 – will be 
analyzed using a two -way analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors of 
treatment group, site/analysis center, treatment*center interaction, baseline IGA and a 
covariate of baseline inflammatory lesion count . 
• Change in non -inflammatory lesion counts on the face from baseline to Week 12 – will 
be analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as for the inflammatory lesion counts (with covariate of baseline non- inflammatory lesion count instead of inflammatory) . 
 In the above analyses, any significant Breslow -Day or treatment*center interactions (P<0.15) 
will be examined, and if outlier centers are identified, the analysis may be repeated, excluding those centers.  
 To claim success of the study, the analysis of all three co -primary endpoints must show DFD -03 
Lotion significantly superior to the vehicle lotion (at the 5% level, 2 -sided).  No multiplicity 
adjustments will be applied . 
 
11.4.2 Primary Sensitivity Analysis  
 
To assess the sensitivity of the above primary methods  to missing  data, analysis will also be 
conducted for the ITT population with missing values being imputed by [CONTACT_112981]:  
1) The last -observation- carried -forward (LOCF) approach: W
here a co -primary endpoint (IGA, 
inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion counts)  has missing Week [ADDRESS_126103] . 
2) Multiple imputation (MI) approach with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method:  
The variables to be imputed will be the three co -primary efficacy endpoints (IGA and the 
inflammatory and non- inflammatory les ion counts) at all visits .  The MI regression model 
(used to create the imputations) will include the following factors : treatment, age, gender, 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 06)  
DFD -[ADDRESS_126104] -stage MI with MCMC will be 
performed using SAS PROC MI (seed=[ZIP_CODE]) to produce a single imputed dataset with a 
monotone missingness pattern.  Subsequently, a second- stage MI will be performed 
(seed=[ZIP_CODE]) using the logist ic regression method to produce 5 imputed datasets with all 
visit values filled in.  The primary analysis described above will then be performed on each of the 5 imputed datasets (for each of the 3 primary endpoints), which will produce estimates of treatment difference (DFD -03 minus vehicle; in the case of IGA success, it will 
be the estimate of difference in logodds and will be back- transformed to odds ratio and 
corresponding CI at the end) and the standard error of that estimate.  Finally, the set of estimates and standard errors will be analyzed by [CONTACT_112982], confidence intervals, and P -values for the treatment effect.  
 
11.4.3 Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary endpoints  are: 
 
1. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in i nflammatory lesion counts on the 
face  
2. Percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in non -inflammatory lesion counts on 
the face 
 The s econdary endpoint s will be analyzed as follows : 
 The percent change from Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_126105] analysis of co variance ( ANC OVA)  model 
with factors of treatment group , site/analysis center , and baseline IGA  and a covariate of 
baseline lesion count . 
 To control for overall Type I error rate for testing multiple secondary endpoints , statistical 
analysis for the secondary endpoints will be performed if p<0.05 has been achieved for all the co-primary endpoints, us ing a sequential  approach according to the  following  order: percent 
change in inflammatory lesion counts  on the face, and then  percent change in non- inflammatory 
lesion counts  on the face . In details, if p<0.05 is achieved for a higher ranking secondary 
variable, then success will be declared for the variable, and statistical comparisons will be performed for the lower ranking variable. If p<0.05 is not achieved for a higher ranking variable, then statistical comparisons will be considered descriptive (non- inferential) for this 
variable and for the  lower ranking secondary variable.  
 
11.4.4 Other Efficacy Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the ITT population for the following efficacy 
endpoints   
1) Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the face

counts on the face at Weeks 4 and 8.  
4) Proportion of subjects with an IGA score of [ADDRESS_126106] a 2 -grade reduction (for 
the face) from Baseline at Weeks 4 and 8 . 
5) Change from Baseline in Children’s DLQI total score in subjects 16 years of age or 
younger at Weeks 4 , 8 and 12. 
6) Change from Baseline in DLQI score in subjects >16 years of ag e at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. 
7) Percent change from Baseline in inflammatory, non -inflammatory and total lesion counts

8) Time to 50% reduction in total lesion counts on the c hest and /or back  (including 
shoulders ). 
9) Proportion of subjects with at least a 2- grade improvement from Baseline in the SGA  at 
Week 12.  
10) Change from Baseline in CADI score at Weeks [ADDRESS_126107] to the subsequent visits 
for the analysis.  
 
11.4.6 Pooling Analyses  
For the purpose of analysis, a small site  is defined as a site with <  [ADDRESS_126108] small site will be pooled with the next small site, or with more 
sites if needed, until the pooled site/analysis center has at least [ADDRESS_126109] site/analysis center.

than 28 days, 28 to 56 days, 57 to 84 days and more than 84 days will be summarized.  
 
11.5.2 Local Cutaneous Safety Evaluation  
Non-lesional erythema, peeling, dryness, burning, stinging, and itching scores  will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_112983], frequency count and percentage  
for each visit . A similar summary will be provided excluding subjects with signs or symptoms 
present at Baseline.  
 11.5.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology. Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) are AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study product  
administration. For the safety population, all reported TEAEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490], the number and percent of subjects reporting events, system organ class  (SOC), preferred 
term (PT), severity, relationship to study product , and seriousne ss. When summarizing TEAEs 
by [CONTACT_112984], each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by [CONTACT_112985].  
 Additionally, t reatment -related TEAEs  will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_16430], and further by [CONTACT_926] . A TEA E will be considered treatment- related if it is reported as 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment .  
 SAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study due to an AE will be provided.  All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim term given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system organ class, onset date, resolution date, maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding study product , corrective 
treatment, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to dat e of first administration.  
 AEs related to study procedures done before study product  administration will be provided in a

APPENDIX 1: DECLARAT ION OF HELSINKI (201 3) 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_126113] WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
A. PREAMBLE   
1. The Wor ld Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians . The 
WMA encourages other s who are involve d in medical research involving human subjects to adopt 
these principles.  
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consideration,” and the international Code o f Medical Ethics declares that “A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health , well -being and rights of patients, 
including those who are involved in med ical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.   
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving  human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually throug h research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects 
and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of me dical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrit y, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician 
or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given 
consent.   
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No  
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the e nvironment.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by [CONTACT_112986], training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy

DFD -[ADDRESS_126114], incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
research study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -
trial provisions.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 06)  
DFD -[ADDRESS_126115] submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information.  
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
25. Participation by [CONTACT_112987]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post- study provisions and any other  r elevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the 
physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential s ubject's freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed abou t the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_30388].  
28. For a potential research subject who is in capable of giving informed consent , the physician mu st seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the  group represented by [CONTACT_112988], the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons  capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should be 
respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group . In such circumsta nces the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such 
 
 
 
 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 06)  
DFD -[ADDRESS_126116] fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after 
consideration and approval of a re search ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO 
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, the us e of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine t he efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of no receiving the 
best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participan ts who still need an intervention identified as 
beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process.  
K. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study in volving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible database 
before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly 
available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical r eporting. 
Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in 
the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or  other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seekin g expert advice, with informed consent 
from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This 
interventio n should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.

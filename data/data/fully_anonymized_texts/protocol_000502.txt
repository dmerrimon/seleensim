Original: August 20, 2020 
Version: November  3, [ADDRESS_1168095] has been demonstrated to reduce lung cancer mortality by [CONTACT_8622] 20% in a subset 
of high- risk smokers, though potential longitudinal benefits may be greatly reduced in those with 
comorbid illness. While lung cancer screening is both feasible and likely highly beneficial in 
many persons living with HIV , there are limited prospective data and no HIV- specific guidelines 
to support tailored lung cancer screening decision making in this population, who are  at higher 
risk for multimorbidity associated with aging. This study will bridge this significant knowledge 
gap through the iterative development and evaluation of tools to guide the shared decision 
making process for lung cancer screening in persons living with HIV .  The study will consist of 
the following specific aims and approach : 1) Co nduct a formative evaluation using qualitative 
methods to guide adaption and implementation of shared decision making for lung cancer 
screening tailored to  persons living with HIV  incorporating lung cancer risk as well as HIV 
severity, comorbidity and life expectancy ; and 2) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_840649]- methods to assess the impact on patient knowledge and decisional conflict, 
as well as intervention acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity. Aim 1 includes focus groups 
of persons living with HIV and interviews with their primary providers to determine key barriers 
and facilitators to tailored shared decision making. M easures of comorbidity and life expectancy 
are also incorporated into this process to develop a tailored shared decision making intervention. Aim 2 is a single- arm feasibility trial to determine both the preliminary effectiveness 
and implementation of the shared decision making approach. The results of this study will be 
used to develop and refine tools for shared decision making for lung cancer screening in 
persons living with HIV , allowing for subsequent scale- up of implementation and assessment of 
effectiveness, reach and sustainability in a multicenter trial.  This study directly addresses NIH 
high priority research topi[INVESTIGATOR_840650]. 
1.2. Relevant L
iterature and Data  
1.2.1 . 
The burden of lung cancer is particularly high in aging persons with HIV ( PWH ). 
Non-AIDS defining cancers are increasing in aging P WH. Approximately 50% of PWH in the US 
are over the age of 50, and lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death.1,2 The 
cumulative incidence of lung cancer by [CONTACT_654] 65 in this population is 2.2% vs. 1.3% in the non -
infected population.3 This is largely attributable to high rates of tobacco use in U.S. PWH ; an 
estimated 60% are current or former smokers.[ADDRESS_1168096] poorer survival than their 
uninfected counterparts, highlighting the potential benefits of early detection to overcome these 
disparities.7-9 
1.2.2 . LCS is an effective tool for early detection in high -risk populations. The National 
Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrolled >50,000 current or former smokers (quit within 15 years) 
of ≥[ADDRESS_1168097] arm had a 20% decrease in deaths from lung cancer and a 7% decrease in all -cause

2 | Pagemortality.[ADDRESS_1168098] been confirmed in a subsequent trial,11 and the United 
States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for a similar high-risk 
group.12 Due to this recommendation, and similar guidelines from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid services (CMS), LCS is provided to insured eligible individuals without cost -sharing.13 
This benefit is also extended to many who are age ≥50 with smoking history ≥20 pack -years 
with an additional lung cancer risk factor based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
[ADDRESS_1168099] did not include P WH;[ADDRESS_1168100] eligibility criteria was 18.9% 
for PWH who are adherent to ART, similar to the 20.0% seen in NLST19 (see preliminary work). 
Thus, LCS is likely to benefit PWH using similar criteria as the general population.

Aggregate benefits of screening may not be experienced for several years  after cancer 
diagnosis  (“pay -off” time).21-[ADDRESS_1168102] risk from related diagnostic or therapeutic complications, and/or competing causes of death, and thus unlikely to have sufficient “pay -off” time to derive benefits of 
screening.

Index (CCI) scores ( ≥ 2 vs 0 -1) showed significantly lower 5 -year survival among patients with 
resectable stage I non- small cell lung cancer.26  
1.2.5 . Shared decision making (SDM) is used to guide patient -centered decisions 
regarding LCS; however, there are no tools tailored for PWH . SDM is defined as an 
“approach where clinicians and patients share the best available evidence when faced with the task of making decisions, and where patients are supported to consider options to achieve 
informed preferences.”
27,[ADDRESS_1168104] lower life expectancy, 
screening may be approached as more patient preference -sensitive.12,29 Thus, an 
understanding of competing risk and life expectancy may be beneficial for clinicians and patients in deciding whether to screen, and particularly for PWH given their burden of 
multimorbidity.

 2. Study Objectives  
 
2.1. Aims  
 
Aim 1.  Conduct a formative evaluation using qualitative methods to guide adaption and 
implementation of shared decision making (SDM) for LCS tailored to PWH  incorporating  
lung cancer risk as well as  HIV severity, comorbidity and life expectancy.  
H1. Key themes w ill emerge from focus groups  and interviews  with PWH and providers that will 
help structure a SDM process for PWH and determine how best to incorporate measures of HIV 
severity, comorbidity and life expectancy, such as the Veterans Affairs Aging Cohort Study and 
Charlson Comorbidity risk indices.  
 
Aim 2.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_840651] -methods to assess the impact on 
patient knowledge and decisional conflict, as well as  intervention acceptability, 
appropriateness and fidelity.  
H2. Tailored SDM will result in improvements in patient knowledge and result in low levels of 
decisional conflict. Surveys of patients and interviews of patients and stakeholders will be 
utilized t o inform and subsequently iterate the intervention with regards to acceptability, 
appropriateness and fidelity.  
 
2.2. General Schema of Study Design  
 The study will include: 1) a multilevel qualitative assessment of PWH and their providers to 
gather formative i nformation to guide implementation of SDM for LCS and 2) A pi[INVESTIGATOR_840652] a mixed -methods assessment.  
 
2.3. Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
 
2.3.1.  Date Range of Study  
 This study will be conducted October 2020- September 2022. Estimate to complete Aim 1 in 
months 1- 10 and Aim 2 in months 11 -24. 
 2.3.2.  Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
 There will be two sites for the study which perform separate tasks. The FHCRC will serve as the 
administrative home for the project and house the study Co- leader ([CONTACT_840663]) and the 
research coordinator. Will also be site of all data analysis.  
 
The UW Madison Clinic will serve as the enrollment site and clinical visit site for Aim 1 . UW 
Madison C linic will serve as the enrollment site and both UW Madison Clinic and Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Center  will serve as the clinical visit sites for Aim 2. In Aim 1, Madison Clinic 
conference space will supplement online focus groups and interviews.  In Aim 2, data collection 
will be concurrent with a clinical visit for LCS enrollment.  
 
2.4. Study Population  
 
2.4.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
4 | Page  
  
Aim 1. We will recruit participants from two groups: PWH enrolled in the local UW HIV cohort 
and primary providers at Madison Clinic  and other Seattle -based clinics serving PWH . Using 
proposed USPSTF guidelines, participants enrolled in the registry who are current or former 
smokers, ≥50 years old, and report ≥ 20 pack -years smoking history (n=165) will be eligible for 
recruitment. A purposive sample will be recruited, making every effort to include patients of 
diverse race/ethnicity, sex, income, and spanning the eligible age range for LCS. We will pay 
particul ar attention to recruiting women as well as men. Clinicians (medical doctors, physicians 
assistants , and nurse practitioners) who provide primary care for PWH (n=48) will be eligible.  
 Aim 2:  
PWH who are eligible for LCS based on current USPSTF criteria [SMA1] . Plan to enroll 
approximately 50% who have never had a lung cancer screening exam, and 50% who are overdue (~12 months) for lung cancer screening exam.  
 2.4.2.  Exclusion Criteria  
 Those found to be ineligible for LCS on coordinator review; or who are non -English speaking or 
have cognitive dysfunction that would prevent participation in SDM. 
 
3. Study Procedures  
 3.1. Aim 1  
 
3.1.1.  Recruitment, enrollment and consent  
 PWH who are recruited for focus groups will be identified through the research registry (in which 
they have consent for contact [CONTACT_840653]). Participants will be recruited from the registry  who meet the following criteria: current or former smokers,  ≥50 years old, and report ≥ 
20 pack -years smoking history (n=165). The research coordinator (RC) will contact [CONTACT_840654]. An initial telephone script (Addendum 1) will be used to contact [CONTACT_840655] . Verbal  consent ( Addendum 2.1, Addendum 2 .2) will be 
used prior to  the focus groups . Participant clinicians will be recruited by [CONTACT_840656]. Jehan with the assistance of the RC. Participant clinicians will also complete a n electronic 
consent prior to the interviews  (Addendum 2.3) . An informational flyer will also be posted at UW 
Madison Clinic (Addendum 15.1)  throughout Aim 1 enrollment.  
 
3.1.2. Focus groups  
 
All focus group participants will initially complete a brief survey  of demographic information over 
the phone or through RED Cap (Addendum 3 [ PWH ], Addendum 4, [ providers ]). The study team 
will use a focus group guide that addresses key constructs of the Tailored Implementation of Chronic Diseases (TICD) checklist, an implementation science framework that identifies 
potential barriers or facilitators of healthcare professional practice and intervention delivery.
30 
Between 3- 5 focus groups of 5 -10 patients will be conducted and 10  clinicians will partake in 
one-on-one interviews, each lasting approximately 1- 1.5 hours.  Patient focus group size may be 
reduced in early recruitment or to accommodate  participants . The facilitator ([CONTACT_46792] ) will then 
go through a widely used decision aid to guide screening, shouldiscreen.com (University of 
Michigan) which includes an estimate of personalized 6- year risk of lung cancer31. In provider 
interviews, two tools to measure competing risks, one to summarize comorbidity (the age-
adjusted CCI) and the other to estimate 5 -year mortality specifically in PWH (the VACS 2.0 
5 | Page  
 Index) , will be introduced alongside a mock tool to aid in shared decision making (Addendum 
16).32,33 The facilitator will lead discussion of barriers and facilitators across TICD constructs of: 
1) tailoring SDM to PWH , and 2) utilizing the measures of competing risk. For example, key 
TICD constructs for tailoring SDM include determining patient needs  and preferences , and 
provider assessments of feasibility  and attitudes towards the guidelines . When considering 
incorporating measures of competing risk, key constructs include the cultural appropriateness 
of the recommendation  for both PWH and their providers as well as provider assessments of 
consistency with other guidelines and relative strength of supporters and opponents . 
Interviews with providers will follow patient focus groups and incorporate resultant themes in the 
discussion. The focus group and interview guide is addended here ( Addendum 5 .1 and 5.2 ). 
These guides will be adapted throughout Aim 1 to improve clarity and receive greater  response 
by [CONTACT_134612] .  
 
3.1.3. Sample Size  
 Thematic saturation, the point at which no further theme are generated from subsequent 
groups, can often be achieved with 3- 6 focus groups.
34 As we are conducting focus 
groups /interviews  with providers and patients  separately , we will allow up to 8 focus groups  and 
10 interviews , and will use iterative analysis to determine saturation.  
 
3.1.4. Data Collection and Analysis  
 All focus groups will be recorded and transcribed. We will use a framework analysis approach 
which combines inductive and deductive methods to generate themes and map them onto an 
implementation framework; in this case we will map themes onto the construct s of the  Tailored 
Implementation of Chronic Diseases  (TICD ) checklist.
30,35 Results will be entirely qualitative and 
key quotes and field notes will be used as evidence in analysis. Initial focus groups  and 
interviews  will be reviewed and coded individually by [CONTACT_840657] ([CONTACT_840664], [CONTACT_840665] , [CONTACT_46792]  and others as designated), who will then compare coding to 
reach consensus on a codebook to use in  analy sis of subsequent focus groups. Codes w ill then 
be analyzed through a constant comparison method to determine key themes , again using a 
framework approach of thematic analysis to map themes onto the specific constructs (such as “patient needs” or “guideline appropriateness”) of the TICD checkli st. We will analyze all focus 
groups in real time to make iterative changes to the focus group guide based on feedback and 
refining potential methods of SDM.  
 3.1.5. Reimbursement  
 
All patient participants will be provided with $40 for participation in the study  and if in- person, 
parking reimbursement . Providers will receive a $ [ADDRESS_1168105],  and provider referrals  (see Addendum 17) to identify potentially eligible 
participants based on age and smoking status. The study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_840658] -years. Participants who 
confirm that they are interested in the study will complete verbal consent for a limited chart 
review to inform risk factors in the shared decision- making tool. This includes age, gender, BMI, 
6 | Page  
 and most recent CD4 count, HIV RNA level, hepatitis C status, eGFR, AST, ALT, platelets , 
WBC count, hemoglobin and albumin. Individuals eligible for LCS will have a study and SDM 
visit scheduled, at which time informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_14676]. Research 
coordinator (RC) will contact [CONTACT_840659]. An initial telephone 
script ( Addendum 6) will be used to contact [CONTACT_840655]. In- person written 
consent ( Addendum 7) will be used at the time of the patient visit. RC will also confirm 
insurance- coverage eligibility for participant at no cost to the participant through UW radiology 
scheduling partner.  
 
3.2.2. Shared Decision Making visit  
 
The coordinator will administer a pre -SDM survey that includes participant demographics, 
participant -reported risk factors, tobacco history, an assessment of LCS knowledge (the LKS) 
used in our prior study36 and minimalist/maximalist approach to healthcare40 (Addendum 8.1 ). 
Participants will then meet with the LCS nurse practitioner (NP), who will provide the SDM intervention and will supplement the discussion using language regarding comorbidity and life 
expectancy developed in Aim 1 to frame decisions; they will come to a mutual decision on 
whether to move forward with the screening process. To inform the tailored discussion,  
comorbidity burden and life expectancy will be estimated for each participant prior to the visit, 
using data from the UW HIV Information System (UWHIS) and EPIC to generate CCI , LCRAT, 
LCDRAT  and VACS 2.0 Index from electronic -health records data (ICD -[ADDRESS_1168106] 
recent lab values within 1 year).  A HIPAA  waiver  has been requested for this purpose. Prior to 
the visit, the participants lung cancer risk will be calculated using the LCRAT and the LCDRAT 
tools and mortality risk will be calculated using the VACS Index 2 .0. The NP will receive an 
interpretation of these results, based on published literature and our preliminary work to guide discussion . The NP will complete SDM with the patient using the tailored SDM tool ( Addendum 
19) and guide (Addendum 20) . The coordinator will observe the SDM discussions in order to 
complete an observational checklist assessing fidelity of the intervention (Addendum 9 ). 
Participants will then complete a post -SDM survey re -assessing LCS knowledge, resultant 
decisional conflict using the low literacy decisional conflict scale,
37 as well as validated 
quantitative 4- item scales of acceptability and appropriateness developed by [CONTACT_15957] -I Weiner, the 
Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) and the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM) (Addendum 8.2 )
[ADDRESS_1168107] demographics and maximum variation on AIM and IAM scores will be contact[CONTACT_5365] a 45-
minute telephone or HIPAA- approved ZOOM interview to explore factors that might influence 
intervention acceptability and appropriateness.  These will be conducted by [CONTACT_122440] . Similar 
interviews will be  conducted with the  NP. Interview guides  (Addenda 10, 11, 12 ) will be adapted 
throughout Aim [ADDRESS_1168108] separate consent delivered over the phone by [CONTACT_71602] (Addendum 13.1 
and 13.2 ). 
 3.2.4. Review of EHR.   
 
Participants in Aim 2 will provide consent and HIP AA authorization ( Addendum 14 ) for limited 
review of their medical records  at the time of clinical visit . A HIPAA waiver has been requested 
7 | Page  
 for review of EHR prior to clinical visit to determine comorbidity burden and life expectancy 
measures used  in production of a tailored SDM tool.  The EHR will be assessed for participants 
to determine the following inform ation  post-SDM visit : data of lung cancer screening scheduling, 
documentation of patient encounters around lung cancer screening, lung cancer screening 
results, lung cancer screening follow -up screening, procedures,  and patient visits.   
 
3.2.5. Sample Size  
 
As this is a feasibility study and the majority of our outcomes are summarized, there is no 
appropriate power calculation to determine sample size. In our previous study of pre - and post -
SDM knowledge,  we found an improvement in overall understanding of possible harms of lung 
cancer screening from 69% to 93% in a group of 45 patients (p=0.002), and relatively few 
patients would need to be enrolled to demonstrate that magnitude of change. However, 
becaus e we are interested in a robust sample to assess the other outcomes, we plan to enroll at 
least 50 patients into the SDM intervention. We will then sample patients for interviews until 
thematic saturation on acceptability and appropriateness are reached.  
 3.2.6. Data Collection and Analysis  
 
Pre-/post -SDM survey data will be collected via tablet, with a paper option if desired. 
Participants will directly enter data into secure Research Electronic Data Capture (R EDCap, 
Vanderbilt University) software. All in terviews will be recorded and transcribed. Key outcomes 
are described above. Pre-  and post -intervention LKS responses will be compared via Chochran-
Mantel -Haenszel or Friedman test  based on data type . A Chochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will be 
used with categorical data and a Friedman test will be used with non- categorical data. The DCS 
will be summarized as the median of scores for participants from 0 (extreme certainty) to 100 (extreme uncertainty). The IAM and AIM will also be summarized and presented as range of 
scores from 1 (low acceptability/appropriateness) to 5 (high acceptability/appropriateness). 
Fidelity will be summarized as median percent of checklist items completed. Joint displays 
consistent with a mixed -methods convergent design will be used to  analyze and interpret the 
data, with themes mapped onto the TICD as in Aim 1.
39  
 
3.2.7 . Reimbursement  
 
Study participants in the shared decision making visit  will receive $[ADDRESS_1168109] - interviews will receive $20 and parking 
reimbursement as needed. Nurse practitioner (s) will receive a $[ADDRESS_1168110]- interview . 
 
 
4. Study Administration  
 
4.1. Data Collection and Management  
 Aim 1: All brief demographic surveys will be conducted over the phone and entered into  
REDCap software (UW ITHS) by [CONTACT_71602]. All focus groups will be audiotaped and then transcribed 
into word by [CONTACT_840660]. These will be stored on the FH secure J: drive  folder 
only accessible to study personnel.  
Aim 2: As above, pre/post survey data wi ll be collected via tablet and administered by [CONTACT_71602]. If 
directly patient entered into tablet will be on R EDCap form. If preferred to be done by [CONTACT_840661] R EDCap by [CONTACT_122440]. All interview transcriptions will be done in W ord and 
8 | Page  
 also maintained in J -drive folder.  Data collected from the EHR will be transcribed by [CONTACT_840662] . 
 
4.2. Confidentiality  
 
All data and records generated during the study will be kept confidential in accordance with FHCRC policies and HIPAA subject privacy. The investigator and other study team members 
will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study. All data will 
be maintained on secure R EDCap softwar e or J-drive as above.  
 4.3. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
 
4.3.1.  Risk Assessment  
 
This study poses minimal risks to the subjects. The main risks are breach of privacy and 
confidentiality. This study involves : self -report of demographic data , participation in recorded 
focus groups , survey and int erview data and limited permission to review EHR relevant to 
patient’s comorbidity burden and life expectancy, and lung cancer screening. Data will be kept 
on password -protected R EDCap or in secure location as above, and spreadsheets maintained 
in password- protected server on password- protected computer. All participants will be assigned 
a study ID and only a single linkage spreadsheet containing MRN and birthdate will be 
maintained in a separate location.  
 
4.3.2.  Potential  Benefits of Study Participations  
 
The main benefit to study participants will be in the form of quality improvement in the UW lung 
cancer screening program  and improve the LCS process for P WH which can directly benefit 
these patients and providers . Partic ipants in Aim 2 will also be enrolled into the LCS program 
should they agree and be eligible.  
 
4.3.3.  Risk -Benefit Assessment  
 The potential benefits to the screening program, the subjects and future patients being 
screening both within and outside of the UW outweighs the minimal risk.  
 4.4. Informed Consent and HIPAA Authorization  
 A waiver of documentation of consent has been approved, as of 2/3/2021, for patients and 
providers in Aim 1. As above, written informed consent will be obtained for each SDM  study 
participant  in Aim 2 . A HIP AA authorization will be required for these subjects participating in 
Aim 2  SDM  given limited review of the participants EHR.  A HIPAA waiver has been requested 
for limited review of participants EHR, prior to formal consen t/HIPAA authorization, specific to 
creation of tailored SDM tool.  A waiver of documentation of consent has been requested for  
remote delivery of  Aim [ADDRESS_1168111]- interview participants.  
 
5. Safety Management  
 
5.1. Clinical Adverse Events 
 
Unanticipated problems involvi ng risks to subjects and others will be monitored throughout 
the study , specifically breaches of confidentiality.  
9 | Page  
  
5.2. Adverse Events Reporting  
 
No significant adverse events are expected as the study procedures are not greater than 
minimal risk. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to 
subjects or others happen during the course of the study, these will be reported to the IRB.  
 
6. Publication  
 
The results from this investigation will be presented at national conferences and published 
in peer -reviewed medical journals.

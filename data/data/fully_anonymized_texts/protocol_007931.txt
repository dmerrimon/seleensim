1.1 Synopsis  
 
Title:  Bone  Marrow  Mesenchymal  Stem  Cell Derived  Extracellular  Vesicles  Infusion 
Treatment for COVID -19 Associated Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] 
(ARDS): A Phase II Clinical Trial  
Study 
Description:  ExoFloTM Infusion Treatment for COVID -19 Associated  ARDS (EXIT  
COVID -19), a multicenter,  double -blinded,  placebo -controlled,  randomized 
control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety in COVID -19 associated 
moderate to severe ARDS.  
Objectives:  To evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  of intravenous  (IV) administration  of bone 
marrow mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), ExoFlo, 
versus placebo as treatment for COVID -19 associated moderate -to-severe 
Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS).  
Endpoints:  Primary  Endpoi nt: 
1) Improvement in partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_218686] (PaO 2/FiO 2) ratio from pre -infusion baseline (Day 0) to Day 7. 
PaO 2 may be calculated  from  arterial  blood  gas (ABG)  or imputed  from  the 
SpO 2 daily (                         ). 
Note:  Day [ADDRESS_262748] 
Study Intervention.  Patients may  be screened and treated within the same  24 
hours—in this scenario, Day 1 will  be synonymous with Day 0 & the pre - 
infusion value used will be from Day 1 . 
Secondary  Endpoints:  
2) Time to recovery as defined by [CONTACT_218699]  (SpO2)  ≥ 93% on room  air 
(or PaO2/FiO2  ≥ 300 mmHg).  If patient  has chronic  lung disease,  recovery 
is defined as pre -COVID -19 SpO2 and O2 support.  
3) Incidence  of serious  adverse  events.  
4) All-cause  mortality. 
Exploratory  Endpoints:  
5) Viremia:  qualitative  serum  severe  acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_103948] 2 
(SARS -CoV -2) ribonucleic  acid (RNA)  load on Days  0 or 1, 15, 29, and 61. 
6) Acute phase reactants: C -reactive protein (CRP), D -dimer, Ferritin, 
interleukin -6 (IL-6), tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF -α) on Days  1, 4, 7, 
10, 15, 29. CRP,  D-dimer,  & Ferritin  also on Day 0.

CD8+  thymus  cells also known  as T lymphocytes  (T cells);  natural  killer 
(NK) cells on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 29.  
8) Sequential  Organ  Failure  Assessment  (SOFA)  Score  on Days  1, 15, 29 for 
patients who are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
9) Quality of life  (QOL) assessment for patients who are discharged.  EQ-5D- 
5L on Days 29 and 61.  See Appendix 11.2 for sample EQ -5D-5L, which 
includes  dimensions  of mobility,  self-care,  usual  activities,  pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression.  
Study 
Population:  Up to 120 adult  male  and female  patients  between  18 and 85 years  of age 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 associated ARDS.  
Phase:  Phase  II 
Site Number:  2-15 
Description  of 
Interventio n: Patients  will be randomized  to one of the following:  
Treatment  Arm 1: PLACEBO  Normal  saline  100 mL 
Treatment  Arm 2: IP (Exoflo)  10ml  dose in Normal  saline  90 mL, which  is 
approximately 800 billion EVs (Lot# P -441-1901 -E5, P-441-2004 -C5). 
Treatment  Arm 3: IP (Exoflo)  15ml  dose in Normal  saline  85 mL, which  is 
approximately 1.2 trillion EVs (Lot# P -441-1901 -E5, P-441-2004 -C5). 
The intervention  will be infused  over 60 minutes  on Day 1 and repeated  on Day 
4 provided that the patient has not recovered as defined by [CONTACT_7535]2 ≥ 93% on RA 
or PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 300 mmHg. If patient has chronic lung disease, recovery is 
defined as baseline SpO2 and O2  support.  
Allocation  of 
Intervention:  Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to each of the three treatment arms initially. 
The Interactive Response Technology will notify the DSMB such that a safety 
and interim  analysis  can be held following  day 7 of the 60th patient  randomized.  
Duration:  Each  patient  will be enrolled  in the  study  for an estimated 60  days.

A: The number of  COVID -[ADDRESS_262758] study administration.  
B: Patients  will be monitored  for 72 hours  as inpatients  following  each  study  intervention . Recovery  will be defined 
in the study  as SpO 2 reaching  ≥ 93%  on RA (or P/F ≥ 300 mm Hg) or pre-COVID -19 SpO 2 or O2 support  if patient has 
chronic lung disease.  
• Following  the first treatment  on Day  1, the patient  may  be discharged  on Day 4 or later.  
• Following  the second  treatment  on Day 4, the patient  may  be discharged  on Day 7 or later.  
• If a patient  received  the first but not the second  treatment,  he/she  may  be discharged  prior  to Day 7. 
• Following  patient’s  discharge,  no labs will be drawn.  Follow -up via phone -call only  on Days  29 and 61. 
C: During the infusion, measurements +/ - 2 minutes of specified times for q5min vitals and +/ - 5 minutes of 
specified times for q15min vitals are considered permissible; following the infusion, vital sign measurements are 
permissible +/ -15 minutes of the spec ified times.  Temperature is required only 5 minutes prior and q15min 
during the course of the infusion.  
D: Serum  pregnancy  test (in women  of childbearing  potential)  will be obtained  on Day 0.  Urine  dipstick  obtained  
on Day [ADDRESS_262759] s tudy treatment if >[ADDRESS_262760].  
E: Not all patients who recovered will receive a repeat study intervention.  Patients who recovered by [CONTACT_2006] 4 do 
not receive a repeat study intervention.  
F: Qualitative SARS -CoV-2 RT PCR will  be used for Day 0 or 1 (prior to the first dose),  15, 29, 61.  If there is a 
shortage of tests, documentation of positive test within 14 days prior to admission suffices for Day 0 or 1.

1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form (either by [CONTACT_218700]’s healthcare proxy).  
2. Stated  willingness  to comply  with all study  procedures  and availability  for the duration  of 
the study  
3. Male  or female  aged 18 -85. 
4. COVID -19 positive  as defined  by [CONTACT_218701] (RT -PCR) SARS -CoV -2. 
5. Moderate to severe ARDS as defined by [CONTACT_218702], * which includes 
timing  within  1 week  of known  clinical  insult  or new or worsen ing respi[INVESTIGATOR_23908]; 
bilateral  opacities  not fully  explained  by [CONTACT_190371],  or lung collapse;  respi[INVESTIGATOR_218694]; PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤ 200 mm Hg.  
6. Hypoxia requiring noninvasive oxygen support such as Nasal Cannula (NC), 
Nonrebreather (NRB), Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP), Continuous Positive 
Airway Pressure (CPAP), high flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC O2) or mechanical 
ventilation (MV) desp ite initiating standard of care.  
7. If the candidate is either a male or female of reproductive potential, he or she must agree 
to use of double barrier method of highly effective birth control contraception such as 
condoms with oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_218695]. The required duration of usage of double barrier 
method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the beginning of the 
screening period until [ADDRESS_262781] dose of the study treatment.  
*Modified  Berlin  definition  used in this study  is the full Berlin  definition,  albeit  without  the PEEP 
specification,  which  implies  mechanical  ventilation.  
 
**To ensure flexible adaptation of products approved by [CONTACT_218703] -19, standard of care is defined as the NIH Current COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines

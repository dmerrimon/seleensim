Stand Alone Protocol: SMOKING CESSATION PI[INVESTIGATOR_8571] – IRB-AAAS6990    
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rebecca Schnall   
Background:     
Of the approximately one million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.), it is 
estimated that between 40 -70% smoke cigarettes, at least three times the prevalence (14%) observed 
in the general U.S. adult population. Consequently, PLWH experience substantial tobacco -related 
morbidity and mortality. In PLWH, after achieving and maintaining a suppressed viral load, smokin g 
cessation is the next most important health behavior to maximize both quality of life and life expectancy. 
Indeed, PLWH who quit smoking upon entering HIV care gain greater than [ADDRESS_353727], there is ‘very low’ quality evidence that tobacco 
cessation interventions were effective in the short -term, and ‘moderate’ quality evidence indicat ing 
similar outcomes to controls in the long -term. 3 Given the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
examining smoking cessation interventions for PLWH, and the major methodological limitations of many 
of these studies (e.g., lack of randomization, compar ison conditions, treatment fidelity assessments, 
abstinence verification tests), it is critical to develop evidence- based tobacco cessation interventions to 
address the complex and unique needs of PLWH (e.g., risk factors, treatment needs). Tailored cessation studies designed for dissemination and implementation are necessary to focus efforts on 
PLWH who use tobacco products.      
Pharmacotherapy Offered to All Participants. Current treatment guidelines recommend 
pharmacotherapy be offered to all smokers ma king a quit attempt.
[ADDRESS_353728] abstinence rates are achieved when 
pharmacotherapy is combined with a behavioral intervention. 6 There are also ethical concerns about 
offering a placebo treatment only in a historically mistreated group; 7-9 therefore, the interventions would 
likely be less acceptable or feasible if a placebo was part of the study design. As part of this intervention, we will provide all participants with NicoDerm CQ Patch as a form of Nicotine     
Replacement Therapy. As all forms of nicotine replacement therapy are over -the-counter medications, 
participants are not required to obtain physician clearance to take them.     
Mobile health (mHealth) is an ideal platform for imple mentation and dissemination of evidence -based 
strategies.
10 mHealth can provide mechanisms for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of care 
provided while reducing administrative burden. mHealth technology can be used for achieving health equity in vulnerable groups because it is a widely available and relatively inexpensive tool for health 
behavior change and can be 
11 adapted to meet the needs of its end -users. 12-15 The emerging evidence 
base on mHealth delivered behavioral interventions supports their promise to improve health disparity outcomes.
16 Therefore, mHealth interventions such as Lumme proposed through this study is timely, 
relevant, scalable and likely to improve health outcomes in our health disparate study population -- 
PLWH who smoke.      
     
Aim: To conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_289997] a population of PLWH as a tobacco 
cessation intervention (N=40)  Hypothesis 1 :      
Overview of Study Aims, Design and Methods     
Purpose: The purpose of the research study is to find out m ore about smoking behaviors in people 
living with HIV and the subsequent efficacy of tobacco cessation strategies.      
Study Design : A pi[INVESTIGATOR_289998] 40 PLWH randomized to 2 arms. Participants will be 
randomly assigned to receive Lumme (active) or a control condition (standard smoking cessation 
counseling session). Participants will also receive a survey at baseline and at [ADDRESS_353729] -baseline.      
Recruitment : We will recruit PLWH by [CONTACT_290002] -based 
organizations throughout [LOCATION_001] City. Potential participants will be pre -screened for eligibility over 
the phone by [CONTACT_464]. We will also provide enrolled participants with a study flyer to share with 
potentially eligible individuals.     
Study Populations : Our study participants will consist of 40 individuals who smoke tobacco. Inclusion 
criteria. (1) PLWH; (2) ≥ 18 years of age; (3) own an Android smartphone; (4) understand and read English; (5) not pregnant or breastfeeding; (6) permanent contact  [CONTACT_3031]; (7) smokes ≥[ADDRESS_353730] 30 days; (8) interested in quitting smoking within 30 days; and (9) blow >5 CO into 
a breath analyzer at baseline. Exclusion criteria . (1) self -report being HIV -negative or unknown status; 
(2) pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study period; (3) planning to move within 3 months of enrollment; (4) a positive history of a medical condition that precludes use of 
the nicotine patch; (5) current use of nicotine replacemen t therapy or other smoking cessation 
medications (e.g., Chantix or Zyban); (6) current enrollment in another smoking cessation program; and  
(7) blows ≤ 5 CO into a breath analyzer at baseline.     
     
Screening : Potential study participants will provide verbal informed consent to complete a phone 
screening that assesses eligibility. If eligible, participants will attend a baseline session described 
below. Those who do not screen eligible will be informed and tha nked for their time.      
     
Procedures : Eligible participants up to this point will be scheduled to attend a baseline visit at the     
Columbia University School of Nursing. Prior to arriving, participants will be asked to complete the 
Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and identify their cigarette type (menthol vs regular). 
Upon arrival to the study site, scheduled participants will be asked to blow into a breath analyzer to complete determining study eligibility. Breath samples will be anal yzed for exhaled carbon monoxide    
(CO) levels (in ppm) using a breathalyzer (Micro 
+TM basic  Smokerlyzer ®). Those identified as ineligible 
will be given a Metrocard to thank them for their time. Those identified as eligible will be given an 
informed cons ent form and the study staff will read the form to them. Before a participant signs the 
informed consent form, staff will answer any questions. Participants will be given a copy of the informed 
consent form for their records.      
     
After providing writ ten consent, study participants will complete a timeline follow back to track their 
cigarette use for the last 30 days. Afterwards, they will complete a baseline questionnaire that includes 
demographic characteristics, tobacco use history, substance use history, alcohol use history, 
psychosocial factors, pharmacotherapy use, and more (See Table 1). Survey instruments will be 
collected through Qualtrics, a secure, Web -based application designed to support data capture for 
research studies, providing an intui tive interface, audit trails, and automated export. Qualtrics is a free 
service offered through Columbia University Irving Medical Center.      
     
Following the completion of the baseline study instruments, study participants be randomized (1:1) to 
the Lumme arm or the control arm . Participants in both arms will undergo a smoking cessation 
counseling session and be provided with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of the NicoDerm CQ Patch, under the supervision of a nurse. They will be provided   
NRT sufficient for an 8 -week supply in order to follow the three -step program. However, they will be 
encouraged not to begin NRT until 2- weeks after the baseline visit. This will be the quit date set for 
participants in both arms.     
     
Participants w ho smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day will receive the following dosage: one 21 
milligram patch per day for 4 weeks; one 14 milligram patch per day for 2 weeks; and one 7 milligram 
patch per day for 2 weeks. Participants who smoke 10 or less cigarettes per day will receive the 
following dosage: one 14 milligram patch per day for 6 weeks; and one [ADDRESS_353731] clinical treatment and participants will receive additional 
instructions on usage of the p atch. Subjects will be told the risks of using the patch, which include skin 
irritation, itching, dizziness, headache, rapid heartbeat, and nausea. Participants will also be advised 
that they can curb additional cravings with their choice of gum or lozenge  available for purchase 
overthe- counter.      
     
For those in the intervention arm, study staff will provide participants with a Misfit Vapor 2 or Skagen 
Falster 2 smartwatch and initiate the Lumme app on the participant’s mobile phone. Both smartwatches  
are compatible with the Lumme app. Participants will be asked to wear the smartwatch and use the app 
for [ADDRESS_353732] 2 
weeks, such as when the user smokes (time of day, day of week, before/after eating, after waking 
up/before going to sleep, before driving to/from work, while driving), where the user smokes, and who is 
nearby [CONTACT_290003] (based on the seeing the same Bluetooth static address as Lumme does 
not collect identities). Once created, the Lumme app will be paired with the smartwatch so that smoking 
will be detected by [CONTACT_290004]. The smartwatch will detect 
cigarettes smoked throughout the time the user wears the smartwatch, or users can manually enter a 
smoking session. The Lumme app will then be able to reliably predict cravings, target users with notifications to prevent individuals from smoking, refine the notifications for each user, and display their 
change in smoking behavior and money saved in a smoking diary. Users will also be able to see their quit plan with their assigned quit date 2 weeks after baseline, along w ith smoking trends, supporting 
tips, and earn badges from the amount of money saved. Data related to participants’ smoking behaviors and patterns will be shared with Lumme. The study coordinator will also be able to access smoking 
behaviors and subject inf ormation through Lumme’s anonymized online dashboard. At the end of the 
baseline visit, all enrolled participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_353733] of the staff reassuring and encouraging the 
participant to stick to their quit date. Specific details for the call will be provided to staff via a phone 
script.    
   
Upon reaching their quit date, participants in the intervention arm will receive personalized feedback in 
the Lumme app. Also, participants in  both the control and intervention arm will receive biweekly checkin 
calls from study staff members. Staff will complete these calls in order to 1) track participants reported NRT fidelity, 2) provide technology assistance to those in the intervention arm who might experience 
difficulties with the smartwatch or app, and 3) keep participants engaged in the study.

At 12 weeks after the baseline visit, participants will attend a 12 -week follow -up visit at the study site.   
Or if requested, participants can complete a remote study visit, where they will be mailed a CO monitor 
( by [CONTACT_290006] a study team member. 
Study participants will be asked to report a 7 -day point prevalence abstinence of smoking cigarettes 
and provide a breath sample using Micro +TM basic  Smokerlyzer ®. They will also be given a follow -up 
survey that includes questions asked at baseline and process questions dictated by [CONTACT_290007] (see Table 1).     
    
At the 12- week follow -up visit, semi -structured in -depth interviews will  take place with participants . The 
in-depth interviews will be approximately 10-30 minutes in length and no additional compensation will 
be provided. The in- depth interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_290008], the members re sponsible for conducting follow -up visits. These interview s aim to fill gaps in 
the literature by [CONTACT_41680] a qualitative approach to understanding the acceptability of the   
Lumme app as a smoking cessation tool in the intervention arm and learn more about all participants’ 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_290000]. Both groups will answer questions including : 1) 
How would you modify the outreach and recruitment process to improve it or make it easier?  2) How 
comfortable were you with the recr uitment, screening and enrollment process?  3) How can we improve 
the current screening process?  Some of the questions the questionnaire will include for the intervention 
group are: 1) Please describe your general perceptions and expectations of the app, 2)  How often did 
you use the app? 3) How helpful was the app for tobacco cessation?  
 
 
The team will adhere to qualitative research processes to ensure the credibility, confirmability, 
dependability, and transferability of the qualitative data from these anal yses. [ADDRESS_353736] peer debriefing and triangulate findings across multiple data sources 
(surveys). In addition, we will use “member checks,” i.e., sharing of initial data interpretations with participants to en sure accurate interpretations. Triangulation of findings, along with reflexivity, will 
enhance the confirmability of the interpretations. The investigators will carefully record an audit trail and keep extensive field notes to facilitate transferability of  study findings into other contexts.     
At the end of the 12 -week follow -up visit, participants will be compensated $[ADDRESS_353737] at each in -person visit.     
     
Operationalization of Outcome Measures:  The primary outcome for determining preliminary efficacy 
will be biochemically validated 7 -day point prevalence abstinence.      
    
Analysis : This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_290001], acceptability, and efficacy. Given 
the small samp le size, the purpose of the arms is simply to monitor for unexpected, gross differences 
between arms.      
To determine acceptability, we will ask participants in both arms how useful each of the intervention 
components are (1 = Not at all useful  to 7 = Extremely useful ) and whether they would recommend the 
program to a friend (1 = Definitely would not recommend  to 7 = Definitely would recommend ). For the 
intervention to be deemed acceptable, the mean level for each of these measures would have to be five 
or higher.     
All in- depth interviews will be transcribed verbatim and then coded. The development and application of 
a coding scheme is an integral component of the data analysis process. It enables the systematic 
examination and interpretation of the dat a related to the primary analytic foci. The coding scheme is 
conceptualized as a multilevel structure. At the highest level are the primary analytic foci coded as headings. Specific aspects or dimensions of the headings are assigned core codes. Specific aspects or 
dimensions of the core codes are assigned sub codes. We use ATLAS.ti, a software program for 
qualitative analysis, to facilitate the analysis.    
    
The following 7 steps will be used to develop the coding scheme:     
Step 1: Identify the princip al issues discussed by [CONTACT_290009].     
Step 2: Construct definitions of the primary analytic themes.     
Step 3: Develop and apply core codes and sub -codes to the initial set of interviews.     
Step 4: Develop a provisional coding scheme.     
Step 5: Test and refine the provisional coding scheme.     
Step 6: Reconcile coding differences and construct an updated and final coding scheme.  Step 7: Apply 
the coding scheme to the full data set and assess inter -coder reliability.     
    
After all transcripts have been coded, we will extract and examine the content of text segments linked to 
core codes and sub -codes relevant to understanding the technology acceptance of the Lumme app and 
barriers and facilitators to its use. Based on the c oded data, we will propose ways in which certain 
themes are analytically related. A careful examination of the coded text will reveal the associations 
among these themes, and may lead to more refined data searches. Once we establish patterns of relationshi ps among themes and issues, we will identify participants’ accounts that support or refute 
these patterns. Identifying and accounting for cases that deviate from an interpretative pattern enable   
us to test and confirm the pattern’s validity and robustnes s. Schnall has done extensive work  
understanding technology acceptance with particular emphasis on end- users’ needs.

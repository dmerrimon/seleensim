1. Study Summary  
 
1.1 Synops is 
This randomized placebo -controlled phase 2 study will evaluate whether a two -week exposure to duvelisib , a 
gamma/delta PI3K inhibitor, reduces inflammation in the lungs in patients with severe SARS- CoV-2 infection and 
COVID -19 who do not require mechanical  ventilation at study initiation. The primary objective of the study is to 
determine the efficacy of duvelisib  treatment in preventing death or the need for mechanical ventilation among 
patients with WHO -defined severe COVID -19. Key secondary endpoints wil l be reductions in oxygen 
requirements of patients and improvements in their performance status, safety and tolerability of duvelisib  in 
the setting of COVID -19, biomarkers of inflammation, and generation of IgG antibody responses to SARS -Cov-2 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870].  The study will determine if a two -week exposure to duvelisib  beginning soon after presentation 
with severe COVID -19 warrants further evaluation in a larger clinical study.  
Title:  Duvelisib  Ameliorates Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Co ronavirus 
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Study 
Description:  This randomized placebo -controlled phase 2 clinical study will evaluate whether a two -
week exposure to duvelisib  in subjects with  severe  COVID -19 is safe and well tolerated, 
and whether exposure to the maximally effective dose of duvelisib  will safely and favorably 
change inflammatory bio -markers and reduce the incidence of the composite end -point of 
mechanical ventilation or death following the diagnosis of severe COVID -19. We 
hypothesize that short term exposure to duvelisib  in patients with severe COVID -19 will 
decrease the incidence of mechanical ventilation and death compared with placebo -
treated control subjects. We also hypothesize that duvelisib  will decrease inflammation 
and improve time to resolution of symptoms.

OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  
11) Median titers of Ig G antibodies to SARS -CoV-2 at 
4 weeks  
12) Survi val at day 50-[ADDRESS_668058] a poor  prognosis, especially in the setting of  co- morbidities, the presence of 
inflammatory serum markers, and declining oxygenation levels, with reported frequency of ICU transfer up to 
50% and deat h of 25% (1, 2). Serum inflammatory markers in patients with severe COVID -19 including those that 
require ICU care and respi[INVESTIGATOR_515521] (1) , and COVID -19 patients develop a pattern of interstitial pulmonary infiltrates (3, 4)  
that are similar to those seen among patients that develop auto -immune pneumonitis in the setting of treatment 
with monoclonal antibodies that block immune check -point signaling (5) . Taken together, these clinical and 
laboratory observations have led to the hypothesis that COVID -19 leads to hyper -immune activation, al so termed 
“cytokine storm” (6).  Immunomodulatory clinical interventions that are currently being evaluated included 
antibodies that block IL6 signaling ( 22 trials ),  IL1 signaling ( 5 trials ), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors to Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase  (BTK) (7), Janus2 Kinase (JAK) ( 2 trials ). The common theme in these studies is the hypothesis  
that intra- cellular signaling pathways of immune cells are hyper-activated, that immune hyperactivation 
contributes to alveolar damage and impairments in gas exchange, and that  clinical interventions to block intra-
cellular tyrosine kinase -mediated signa ling pathways activated during COVID -19 will prevent or reverse the 
alveolar damage and hypoxemia that characterizes this disease. Recently, clinical data from CLL patients treated with duvelisib , a dual PI3K gamma/delta inhibitor, indicate lower levels of serum inflammatory markers  during 
PI3Ki exposure (8) .  Addition of PI3K inhibitors, including duvelisib , during ex vivo  expansion of T cells stimulated 
with anti CD3/CD28 beads indicates PI3K -inhibition appears to block differentiation of T cells from naïve/central 
memory to effector phenotypes, increases frequencies of CD8+ T cells,  and improves in vivo persistence and anti -
tumor activity when PI3Ki -expanded T cells are reinfused in vivo (9) . Paradoxically, continuous exposure to 
duvelisib  over a period of months has been associated with both opportunistic infections (10, 11)  as well as auto -
immune toxicities (12, 13) , supporting the idea that duvelisib  is an immunomodulatory drug, and indicating that 
short -term exposure to PI3Ki may have different immunological consequences than long- term exposure.    
 
This study will examine if a 2 -week exposure to duvelisib  in patien ts with severe COVID -19, will favorably change 
their immune profile, decreasing alveolar inflammation and damage, and decrease the incidence of patients who require mechanical ventilation or who die.  
 
3.2  SARS- CoV-2 and COVID -19  
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] -2 (SARS -Cov-2) is a novel emerging pathogen that results in an 
illness called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19). COVID -19 is an acute flu -like illness characterized by [CONTACT_411], 
dry cough and shortness of breath. In approximately 80 -85%  of individuals these symptoms will be mild to 
moderate, whereas in certain patient subgroups, such as the elderly and those with chronic cardiovascular disease, the illness may be severe, resulting in hypoxic respi[INVESTIGATOR_42679] (1, 14) . Prior to the 
development and after resolution of symptomatic disease, patients shed virus in mucosal surfaces, which facilitates spread of the disease. SARS- Cov-2 has a basic reproductive number of >2, meaning that the disease 
has the potential to expand at exponential rates. The outbreak started initially as 4 cases of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China, but on March 11th, 2020, with over 118,000 cases spread across over 110 countries, the World

Heal th Organization (WHO) declared Covid -19 a pandemic. As of April 19, 2020, according to the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention, there were over 690,000 confirmed cases and 35,000 deaths in the US due to 
this disease (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2 019-ncov/casesupdates/cases -in-us.html), and experts predict 
that the number of individuals needing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515522]. 
Agents under investigation for treatment of COVID -19 include , but are not limited to , remdesivir, a nucleotide 
analogue, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, IL -6 blockers and lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, as reviewed (15). 
 
3.3  Inflammation as part of lung pathology in COVID -19  
Following initial infection of the nasal pharyngeal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], SARS -Cov-2 infection can spread to the lungs where 
it causes viral  pneumonia, producing symptoms of dyspnea secondary to hypoxemia (2, 14) , with radiographs 
showing interstitial infiltrates in the lung periphery (3, 4), collectively creating a novel disease entity termed 
COVID -19. Severe pneumonia can progress to Adult Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS) requiring intubation 
and mechanical ventilation (1, 2).The development of severe pneumonia and respi[INVESTIGATOR_515523] (1, 6) , suggesting that SARS- CoV-2 pulmonary 
infection in these patients has led to a “cytokine storm”, and that administration of drugs that inhibit cytokine release or block cytokine signaling may be of clinical benefit in patients with COVID -19.  A recent report from 
Wuhan described 548 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19, half of whom had severe disease (defined by  [CONTACT_941] 
2019 American Thoracic Society Guidelines (16) ) of which one third required mechanical ventilation and one third 
died (1). Age, male gender, elevated leukocyte counts, LDH, troponin and glucose levels  were associated with an 
increased risk of death among COVID -19 patients with severe disease in a multi -variable model, and treatment 
with steroids, a  non-specific immunosuppressive, were associated with an increased risk of death. Serum 
cytokine levels for IL -2R, IL -6, IL-10, and TNF -α were significantly higher in COVID -19 patients with severe disease 
than nonsevere patients (1) . These data and other reports of similar findings indicate that 1) patients with severe 
disease at a higher risk of death can be identified by [CONTACT_515564], 2) that disease 
severity is associated with a heightened inflammatory state, and 3) interventional studies to reduce inflammation 
in patients with high- risk disease could be of benefit to patients. A sep arate  analysis of Wuhan patients with 
severe COVID -19 indicated that patients with severe disease had decreased numbers of total T cells, CD8+T cells 
and CD4+T cells, and that lower T cell numbers were negatively correlated with patient survival (17). Of note, 
lower T cell numbers in patients were also associated with higher IL -6, IL -10 and TNF -α cytokine levels, and 
COVID -19 patients treated in the ICU had higher levels of expression of the coinhibitory markers PD -1, LAG -3 and 
TIM-3 (17), suggesti ng that inflammation may cause quantitative and qualitative suppression of  T cell function
. 
 
3.4  Phosphoinositide 3- Kinase (PI3K)  
 
PI3K proteins are divided into three classes of which only Class IA PI3K molecules have been implicated in human cancers, prompting development of isoform -selective inhibitors to Class IA PI3K (18) . Analysis of evolutionary 
conservation across known class I PI3K signaling cascades reveals the greatest conservation in signaling along the insulin/IGF -1/AKT pathway, suggesting PI3K primarily evolved to regulate cellular proliferation and metabolic 
chan ges in response to glucose (18) . 
 PI3Ks are involved in the generation of lipid second messengers and contain eight catalytic subunits of PI3K, with the P110 gamma and the  P110 delta subunits being expressed at much higher levels in immune cells (19, 20) . 
The PI3K p110 subunits work by [CONTACT_515565] 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3, 4,5 triphosphate (PIP3), which enables anchorage and association of cytosolic proteins near the lipid bilayer, enabling complex signal transduction cascades to occur (18) .   In the case of T cells, 
metabolism of glucose is closely linked to the replicative capacity of the cells, with T cells capable of oxidative phosphorylation exhibiting enhanced replicative capacity whereas T cells that  rely upon glycolysis exhibit reduced 
replicative potential, as reviewed (21).
 
Protocol Title :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus  
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 13 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. 3 30-JUNE -2021  
 
PIP3 then goes on to function as a second messenger that initiates multiple signaling cascades, including the phosphorylation of AKT, a serine/threonine protein kina se, leading to downstream survival and differentiation 
signals for example through mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTOR) also a serine/threonine kinase (22). Upon 
T cell activation, there is an increase in uptake of amino acids and glucose leading to activation of mTOR1 and this activation is required to maintain the T cell effector functions (23 –26). Activation of mTOR1 also promotes 
induction of aerobic glycolysis, as well as assistance in maintaining it, which leads to increased differentiation and effector functions, which are shown to be less efficacious in terms of adoptive T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (26) . By 
[CONTACT_515566]3K. PI3K inhibitors promote formation of a pool of T -cells with a memory 
phenotype by [CONTACT_515567] (26) .  Given that Daio et al. 
showed that CD8 and CD4 T -cells in COVID -19 patients increase expression of PD -1 and TIM -3 as their  clinical 
symptoms worsen (17), we propose that duvelisib  may mitigate T -cell exhaustion to promote more effective anti -
viral responses to COVID -19, thus preventing COVID -19 infection progression.  
 
3.5 Pre-Clinical Pharmacology of duvelisib  and T c ell activation and expansion  
Duvelisib  is a highly potent, PI3K d elta and gamma inhibitor with a whole blood IC 50 of 0.36nM for inhibition of 
the delta subunit and whole blood IC 50 of 19.6nM for inhibition of the gamma subunit (11) .  We have seen that 
human T cells from healthy volunteers  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients show a doubling in net 
expansion at concentrations of duvelisib  from to 40nM to 0.4 µ M over a 9 -14 day culture period ( (9) and 
unpublished data).  Of note, high dimensional profiling of T cells showed less effector T cells and a shift in the 
metabolic profile of T cells from dependency on glucose to glutamine and lower levels of expression of co -
inhibitory markers PD -1, TIM -3 and LAG -3 (unpublished). Furthermore, models of the human CLL cell line OSU -
CLL engrafted to NOG mice show that duvelisib -cultured chimeric antigen receptor  (CAR) T-cells exhibit enhanced 
in vivo proliferation, greater CD8:CD4 CAR ratios, and enhanced efficacy (unpublished data). Taken together, this 
data indicates that a short -term exposure of T cells to duvelisib  is not globally immunosuppressive but instead 
pres erves qualitative measures of T cell function while reducing effector T cell differentiation and preserving 
naïve and memory subsets.  
 
3.6 PI3K inhibitors in clinical settings  
 
PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors are FDA -approved for treatment of relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) and CLL/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Orally bioavailable drugs are typi[INVESTIGATOR_515524] a day with the goal of 
inhibiting signaling through the PI3K -AKT pathway causing reduction in the growth of malignant lymphoma cells 
and induction of apoptosis. PI3K inhibitors are generally well tolerated and can be given for weeks to months as 
continuous therapy without significant hematological toxicity. One common feature of treatment with PI3K inhibitors is the development of late autoimmune disease, typi[INVESTIGATOR_515525] 1 month of drug exposure, including colitis, pneumonitis and rash, that appears to be a consequence of blocking differentiation and down -
regulation  of regulatory T cells (12, 27) .  
 
4. Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
 
4.1 Description  (duvelisib ) 
Duvelisib  is an oral PI3K inhibitor.  FDA approved duvelisib  (Copi[INVESTIGATOR_410566], IPI -145) on September 24, 2018. Duvelisib  
is approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL after at least two prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Refer 
to the approved labeling for more details on specific indications and for detailed information on duvelisib .

4.2 Drug h andling  
4.2.1 Acquisition and Accountability  
 
Duvelisib  and unmatched placebo capsule (same size and shape but slightly different shade of blue/green) will 
be provided by [CONTACT_515568].  The study drug provided for this study 
will be used only as directed in the study protocol. The IDS (Investigational  Drug Service) personnel at each site 
will account for all study drugs. Drug accountability should be performed until the patient stops study treatment completely. Study site personnel will account for all study drugs received at the site.  Study drug supplies must be 
kept in an appropriate, secure locked area and stored in accordance with the conditions specified on the labels. 
The Investigator, pharmacist, or designee must maintain an accurate record of dispensing the study drug/s in a 
Drug Accountabi lity Log.  
 
The Drug Accountability Log  may record specifics to study drug dispensation such as:  
• Records of product delivery, inventory, temperature monitoring, destruction, and return.  
• Dosages prepared, time prepared, doses dispensed.  
• Doses destroy ed.  
• The Drug Accountability Log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_515569].  
 
The study drug supply will be disposed of as per Winship’s Investigational Pharmacy (IDS) SOP.  Duvelisib /study 
drug capsule should be  taken at approximately the same times on each day.  Duvelisib /study drug capsule should 
be taken with 8 oz of water if possible.  Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_1755]/or study personnel and information provided by [CONTACT_80826][INVESTIGATOR_515526] . Dose changes and interruptions of study drug must be specifically documented in the patient source 
documents and eCRF.  The time of each dose should be reported in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515527] . 
Patients will not be allowed to make up missed doses and a missed dose should also be recorded in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515527]. Damaged medication will be replace d. 
4.2.2. Formulation, Appearance, Packaging and Labeling 
 Duvelisib  comes in two strengths: 15mg and 25mg capsules . A placebo capsule matched in size  and shape  with 
similar color to the 25 mg duvelisib capsule will be provided by [CONTACT_276342].  Twenty -eight (2 8) 25mg duvelisib  
tablets or placebo capsule will be dispensed to the in- patient unit for  each enrolled patient. 15mg duvelisib 
tablets are also available if needed for dose reduction. All duvelisib and placebo capsules will be over-encapsulated at the Emo ry Investigational Pharmacy so that they appear identical, to avoid unblinding due to 
differences in duvelisib and placebo capsule color.  
4.2.3. Product Storage and Stability  
 
Duvelisib /placebo will be stored at the Emory Investigational Pharmacy. Duvelisib /study drugs will be stored at 
room temperature between 20 -25 degrees Celsius.  
 
4.2.4. Study Drug Administration:  
 
Duvelisib/placebo  is an oral medication that will be taken twice a day. The intent of the study design is to conduct 
a placebo -contr olled double -blinded/double -masked  administration of duvelisib or placebo in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515528] :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus  
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 15 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. 3 30-JUNE -2021  
patients with severe COVID -19. All efforts will be undertaken to maintain ignorance among clinical and study 
staff as to allocation of each individual patient to acti ve drug versus placebo . Subjects, the clinical team 
(physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers (nurse practitioner/physician assistant ), clinical pharmacists) 
will not be informed as to whether an individual subject is receiving active drug or placebo.   
4.2.5 Interruption/Disruption of Treatment:  
 
Duvelisib/placebo  is a BID medication.  Medication doses that are missed or not absorbed (i.e., vomiting) will not 
be made up with additional dosing.  
Duvelisib  can be stopped if any of the following are observed:  
• Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (19) as defined by [CONTACT_515570]  v5.0. 
• Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological toxicity  
 Study drug ( duvelisib  or placebo) will be stopped at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515529] 15.  
 Grades 1 -2 AEs as defined by [CONTACT_515571],  version 5.0  will not result in any dose modifications and will be 
treated with supportive care. If study drug is stopped due to an AE, it will not be resumed.  
 
5. Study Procedures  
 
5.1  Study Design  
This is a prospective  placebo -controlled, double -blinded/double -masked phase [ADDRESS_668059] demonstrated enhanced T cell expansion and decreased expression of markers associated with T cell exhaustion and senescence in T cells co -cultu red with duvelisib  for 14 days in 
both healthy controls, CLL and DLBCL patients.  While longer exposure to duvelisib  might be considered, it is 
appropriate for an initial study to limit the duration of exposure to reduce the risk of secondary opportunistic infections associated with long -term exposure and to potentially preserve B cell function and humoral responses 
to SARS- CoV-2. 
 
Justification for Duvelisib  Dose  
 
In the phase I study with duvelisib  in hematological malignancies, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was [ADDRESS_668060] was not dose dependent among the doses tested and was 
maximally inhibited at 25mg BID, and this is the FDA approved dose (8) . We will initiate treatment of critically ill 
patients with COVID -19 at an initial dose of 25 mg duvelisib  BID, and dose -deescalate to 15 mg BID if patients 
receive concomitant drug that is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.

5.3 Dose Modification  
The investigator will decide whether any AE that occurs is related to study  drugs and determine whether dose 
modification or discontinuation of duvelisib /placebo  is required.  Treatment of critically ill patients with COVID -
19 will be started at an initial dose of 25 mg duvelisib/placebo  BID, and dose -deescalate to [ADDRESS_668061] -of-care drugs or procedures to 
treat existing signs and symptoms of their disease and to prevent the development of a dditional disease

permitted. Determination of whether the mechanism of action of drugs being tested in COVID -[ADDRESS_668064] screening.  All 
medications should be reported to the investigators and recorded in the concomitant medications page.  
It is anticipated that participants may be treated with antibacterial agents, either for concomitant infection, or bacterial superinfection , anti -coagulants, and passive antibody treatment (immune plasma or purified antibodies 
reactive to SARS -CoV-2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]).  The final decision for antibiotics (need, drug[s] and dose) and other 
medications will be made by [CONTACT_1963] (except as noted below under Prohibited Medications).
 
Concomitant use of medications that  are sensitive CYP 450 substrates (Appendix C) are  prohibit ed, unless 
Protocol Title :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus

absolutely necessary.  If concomitant use of a medication which is a CYP 450 substrates  is required, then adverse 
events (AEs) should be monitored  every 2 days.  
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and CMV p rophylaxis .  
Since duvelisib or placebo exposure is only 14 days, the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_515530], 
and specific antimicrobial prophylaxis with Bactrim (PJP) and valganciclovir  ( CMV) for a 14 period would be  of 
limited clinical benefit given the short time of exp osure to duvelisib, and  prophylaxis with Bactrim and/or 
valganciclovir could lead to a higher incidence of blood cytopenia which might trigger stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648]. 
Given the short term exposure to duvelisib, no PJP or CMV prophylaxis is mandated by [CONTACT_760] , although 
treating physician may prescribe such medications if deemed  to be in the interests  of the subject.   
Prohibited Medications and Food  
 Concomitant medi cations will be tracked daily during duvelisib administration. Patients on strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A (Appendix B) will receive a reduced dose of duvelisib  of 15 mg PO  BID (or matched placebo). Initiation of 
medications known to be strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A should be avoided unless deemed to be 
necessary by [CONTACT_978].  In this instance, patients should be carefully monitored and the duvelisib  dose reduced to 
15 mg PO  BID if the patient was started on a CYP3A inhibitor. Please see Appendix B for known potent inhibitors 
and inducers of CYP3A.  Other anti -neoplastic drugs, radiotherapy and other investigational drugs other than 
anti-viral and  other  non-immunomodul atory drugs to treat signs and symptoms of COVID -19, as described above, 
are prohibited during the study period.  Concomitant use of an immunomodulator  or immunosuppressant 
(Appe ndix E) such as IL -6 inhibitors, TNF inhibitors, anti -IL-1 agents, and JAK inhi bitors  while on study or  within 5 
half- lives or 30 days (whichever is longer) prior to randomization is prohibited.  
 
5.5 Study Procedures  
Before randomization , throughout the study, and following study drug discontinuation, various clinical and 
diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outlined.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed measurements is to 
ensure adequate safety and tolerability assessments .  Clinical evaluations and laboratory studies may be 
repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  The Schedules of Assessments during the screening and treatment period is provided following the Protocol Synopsis . Please see Section C, Schedule of Activities,  Table

limited to IRB -approved investigators. Samples  and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_515579]. Data will be ke pt in password -protected computers. Only  investigators will have access to the 
samples and data.  
All stored samples will be maintained in the laboratory to which it was sent initially for analysis. Study participants 
who request destruction of samples will  be notified of compliance with such request and all supporting details 
will be maintained for tracking.  
The results of some study tests and procedures will be used only for research purposes and will not be placed in subject’s medical record.   
 
7. Sharing of Results with Participants  
In general, study staff will not provide any individual results to subjects (ex. outcome trial results or results from subject’s samples studies). If something of urgent medical importance to the participating subjects will be found, 
the PI (or co -Is) will inform the subject, although we expect that this will be a very rare occurrence. Samples and 
data will only be used for research. 
 
8. Study Timelines  
 
8.1 Duration of therapy  and follow up  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), subjects  will be treated for 14 days  with 
duvelisib /placebo . A subject  will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases 
of the study including the last visit or the last scheduled procedure shown in the schedule of activities. Subjects who have signed consent, are deemed eligible and are randomized to receive study drug ( duvelisib/placebo ) will 
be considered evaluable for efficacy endpoints  on an intent -to-treat basis .  Subj ects who receive at least one 
dose of study drug (duvelisib/placebo) will be evaluable for toxicity.  The end of the stu dy is defined as completion 
of the last visit or procedure in SOA (Day 29 ) and an assessment of survival status on day [ADDRESS_668070] ’s withdrawal, the Investigator will make every effort to complete the End of Treatment procedures 
specified in the Schedule of Events. Subjects who withdraw from the study will be encouraged to permit follow -
up for clinical end -points, including death, mechanical ventilation (e.g. intubation , high -flow 0
2 Bi-PAP or AIRVO) , 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] , and need for supplemental oxygenation.  Subjects will be assessed daily while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If 
the subjects are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they will have phone follow -up calls  with a study team member at

day 15  (window d13 – 25), and at day 29 (window d27 - 39) for clinical outcomes data. Arrangements will be 
made for an outpatient phelebotomy appointment after day 29  (day 30 - day 60 if possible , but up to day 100 ) 
to obtain safety laboratory tests and blood  samples for secondary research . Patients will receive $ [ADDRESS_668071] to return to the clinic. In such  case s, only clinical data will be 
obtained via the d27 - 39 call. 
 
Patients  removed from study  for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization 
of the adverse event and for key clinical end -points including death, mechanical ventilation (e.g. intubation, high -
flow 0 2 Bi-PAP or AIRVO) , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], and need for supplemental oxygenation.  Survival status of each 
subject will be assessed by [CONTACT_515580] -protocol specified in -person or tele -
medicine visits that occurred on or following day 50 - 60, contact[CONTACT_515581], contact[CONTACT_515582], or through a search of vital records.  
 
8.2 Study termination  
 
This study may be suspended or terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  The Sponsor/ Investigator will  
notify the co-investigators and Verastem  if he/she  decide s to discontinue the study.  If the study is prematurely 
closed, the clinical investigators will notify the study participants, and t he Sponsor/Investigator will notify the 
IRB/IEC , and the FDA.  Reasons for suspension and termination of the study include:  
 
• Determination of unexpected or unacceptable risk to patients  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Determination of futility  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements

be registered after signing of the informed consent document and meeting all entry requirements.  
 
11.  Recruitment Methods  
Investigators, nurses, and/or data managers review lists of patients who have COVID -19 and will determine if 
there are patients who might be eligible for a clinical trial. The nurse/data manager reviews accessible medical records to screen further for eligibility.  Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_191499]. Clinical care team  
at Winship will inform potential subjects about the known benefits and potential risks of a clinical trial as well as other available treatment options.  Some of the subjects recruited for this protocol will be patients being treated 
at Emory and under the  care of one or more of the study investigators.  
 
No incentives are provided to patients for trial participation . 
Study personnel will notify Winship Central Subject Registration (WCSR) by [CONTACT_25541] [EMAIL_3314]

After each subject signs consent, the Central Subject Registration form is to be completed and sent to Winship 
within 2 4 hours of consent. This form, along with the valid, signed informed consent form/HIPAA authorization 
form, is to be faxed or emailed to Winship’s Central Subject Registrar per instructions on the form. Once a subject 
is registered, each participating site  will be notified via e -mail.  
 
Enrolling a subject requires careful screening and determination of eligibility.  
Eligible patients will be enrolled on study centrally at Winship Cancer Institute by [CONTACT_408].   
When all required test results are available, complete the eligibility checklist and provide the checklist and the supporting documentation to the  IRB approved investigator for review and sign- off. Once the investigator (sub-
investigator, Co -Investigator) has signed the eligibility checklist, randomization and enrollment may proceed. 
Oncore and ERMS must be updated to reflect eligibility and on trea tment status.  
Following enrollment, patients should begin protocol treatment within  3 days. Issues that would cause treatment 
delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.   
 
Screen failures:  
After the screening evaluations have been completed, the investigator or designee is to review the inclusion/exclusion criteria and determine the participant’s eligibility for the study.  
Only the reason(s) for ineligibility will be collected on screen failures. Participants who are found to be ineligible will be told the reason(s) for ineligibility.  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of an abnormal laboratory finding may be rescreened once

13. Risks to Participants  
Safety of duvelisib :  
 Immune related toxicities are the most common non -hematological adverse event (AE) with duvelisib . Elevated 
AST/ALT and diarrhea are the most common non -hematological AEs. The rates of diarrhea ranged from 42 -51% 
in clinical trials with a median onset of 2 .2-4 months ( 28, 8). The median time of onset for AST/ALT elevation was 
1.2 months and occurred in 39% of patients in one phase I clinical trial ( 28). Other non -hematological AE’s that 
have been reported include : 
 1) risk of infection  (reported in 61 -69% o f patients with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_515537] (8, 29 ).)
 There have also been reports of Pneumocystis jirovecci with the use of 
duvelisib .  
2) risk of pneumonitis,  
3) risk of intestinal infection and colitis,  
4) risk of severe skin reactions  (maculopapular rash)   
5) Neutropenia (the most common hematological AE, occurring in 29% -39% of patients in clinical trials)  
6) pyrexia  
 
Other Risks:  
 
Risk of Phlebotomy - The primary risks of phlebotomy include local discomfort, occasional bleeding or bruising 
of the skin at the site of needle puncture, and rarely hematoma, infection, or fainting. At the time of enrollment 
and during study visits, each participant will be asked about part icipation in other research studies to ensure 
that blood draws do not exceed the following amounts for all research protocols combined: 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any 8 -week period for adults, and no more than 5 mL/kg may in a single day (no 
more than 9.5 mL/kg may be drawn over any 8 -week period) for persons under the age of 18.  
 Risk of Nasopharyngeal Swab- The primary risk of a nasal swab is local discomfort. Rarely, there can be local 
bleeding from the nasal mucosa, which is controlled with local measures such as pressure or packing with 
gauze.  
 Risk of Oropharyngeal Swab-  The primary risk of an oropharyngeal swab is local discomfort. This swab can 
stimulate the gag reflex, and very rarely vomiting.  
 Risk of Endotracheal Aspir ate- The primary risk of endotracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_515538], and rarely can cause a small 
amount of bleeding.  
 
Data security - Subjects will be asked to provide personal health information (PHI). All attempts will be made to 
keep this PHI confidential within the limits of the law. However, there is a chance that unauthorized persons will

see the subjects’ PHI. All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the 
participating sites. Electronic files will be password protected behind an academic institutional firewall. Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing of this study will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected. Any publications from this study will not use information that will identify subjects. 
Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the participating sites for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
14. Potential Benefits to Participants  
 There is no guarantee of benefit to subjects who enroll in this protocol.  
 
15. Data Management and Confidentiality  
 
15.1 Statistical considerations  
The proportion of patients that did not require mechanical ventilation or die within 29 days of randomization  
will be recorded as a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of duvelisib  in this setting.  
 
Definition of subjects  e valuable for efficacy response  
 Subjects who completed screen ing and enrollment procedure and who are randomized to receive  
duvelisib /placebo  will be evaluable for efficacy endpoints  on an intent -to-treat basis .  
 
Definition of NIAID scale    
 The clinical response to study drug is  defined as the first day on which the subject satisfies the criteria of a score 
of [ADDRESS_668086] assessment on  a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Death; 2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on no n-
invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID -19 related or otherwise); 6) 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring suppleme ntal oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 7) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 8) Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activitie s. 
 
Definition of the primary efficacy endpoint  
 The proportion of patients who do not require mechanical ventilation ( e.g. intubation, high -flow 0
2 Bi-PAP or 
AIRVO ) and who survive to 4 weeks  after randomization  will be used as the primary measure of efficacy.  
 
Study design  
This is a randomized placebo -controlled double blind/double masked phase 2 study to explore the efficacy of 
exposure to a PI3K inhibitor in patients with severe COVID- 19.   Subjects who are randomized to receive  d uvelisib  
or placebo will be evaluable for the primary and secon dary efficacy analys es.   All subjects with any exposure to 
duvelisib  will be evaluable for toxicity (please see section 13.3 on grading of toxicities). A total of 80 subjects will 
be planned for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints.  We estimat e that five subjects will be enrolled 
every month. One interim analysis is planned upon 50% (n= 40) of subjects enrolled, which allows us the 
Protocol Title :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus  
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 27 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. [ADDRESS_668087] access to 
unblinded interim data: (a) an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC); and (b) an  independent 
statistical team whose role will be to generate the reports to be reviewed by [CONTACT_31849].  The responsibility of any 
data -informed recommendations regarding cont inuing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515539]/protocol be restricted to the IDMC.  
 
Power Calculation  
The reported incidence of death or mechanical intubation for patients with severe COVID -19 is approximately 
40% (1). Local experience with COVID -19 patients at the Emory hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515540], as 29% 
of all SARS- CoV-2 positive patients (n=800) are admitted to the ICU with COVID -19, and that 22% of all admitted 
patients are intubated, and 37% of  intubated patients die in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A favorable and clinically significant result 
from treatment with duvelisib  in high -risk COVID -19 patients would be to reduce the composite incidence of 
death/mechanical ventilation from 40% to 15%. A sample size of [ADDRESS_668088] 
>80% power to detect a 25% absolute reduction in the proportion of subjects who experience death or 
mechanical ventilation, comparing a predicted proportion of 40% death or intubation in the control arm to 15% 
death or intubation in the experimental arm receiving duvelisib  treatment. The calculation is based on 10% type 
[ADDRESS_668089] with one planned interim analysis when approximately 50% of 
sample enrolled (N= 20/treatment).  For  
 
Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
Analysis of the primary end -point will be based upon an intent -to-treat analysis of all subjects who are 
randomized to receive  duvelisib/placebo . The primary endpoint  is the proportion of patients who will require 
mechanical ventilation or experiencing death within 4-week s (29 days)  after randomization, which will be 
estimated with the corresponding 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence interval for the two arms separately. F isher’s 
Exact test will be used to test the difference between the two arms.  In addition, a logistic regression will be used 
to estimate the odd ratio between the two arms controlling for the baseline covariattes for an improved precision of the estimation  (30).  
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Evaluable subject s will be all subjects who were randomized to receive duvelisib  or placebo. The definition of 
secondary endpoints are  listed in section 2. The descriptive  statistics will mainly be applied to all secondary 
endpoints by [CONTACT_515584] , such as frequency and percentage for categorical endpoints and mean, 
median, and standard deviation for numerical endpoints. They will be compared between treatment arms by [CONTACT_3493]’s Exact test for categorical endpoints and Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test for numerical endpoints. For biomarkers 
measured repeated over time, generalized estimating equation (GEE) model will be used to test the difference in change pattern over time by [CONTACT_515585] a nonlinear model. P -value will be adjusted for 
multiple comparison if necessary. Time to recovery  is as the days from randomization to reach the desired NIAID 
ordinal scale >=5, a log -rank test will be used to compare the difference between the two arms. Survival rate at 
day [ADDRESS_668090].  
 
Interim Analysis for futility  
The responsibility of any data -informed recommendations regarding continuing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515541]/protocol be restricted  to the  independent data monitoring committee  (IDMC ), which is a part 
of the Winship data safety monitoring committee (DSMC). Upon [ADDRESS_668091]. O’Brien -Fleming boundary  for futility is 2.373 on the Z 
score (equivalently: 0. 991 on the fixed sample p- value scale). The trial may be terminated due to futility, or

following review by [CONTACT_515586] -monitoring data. Otherwise, the trial will 
continue enrolling patients until all 80  patients enrolled.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515542] (20 patients/arm), the incidence of death or mechanical ventilation, grade ¾ elevations in 
liver transaminases, or neutropenia will be estimated.  We assume that the underline rate is 40%, 10%, or 24% 
for the three incidences in placebo group respectively , and if the rate in duvelisib  group is >=15% higher than 
that in the placebo group in either of the three incidences, the trial may be stopped due to the safety concern. It also translates to stop the study if 3 or more excess events  in duvelisib  group are observed in either of the three 
incidences.  Operating Characteristics, the probability of trail stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515543] >=3 excess events based one 
simulation study, is listed in the below table.

including neutropenia and elevated transaminases, and consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_515545] 3 or Grade 4 adverse events are significantly higher among subjects in the duvelisib arm 
compared with subjects in the control arm.    
Analysis of Safety Data  
The primary safety endpoints include death or mechanical ventilation, grade  ¾ elvation in liver transminases, and 
neutropenia  within 4 weeks . The cumulative incidence rate  of each safety endpoint will be calculated with 95% 
confidence interval  by [CONTACT_515587], and compared by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact test.  
 
Handing of Missing Data  
For the safety endpoints  and secondary endpoints , missing data will not be imputed, summaries and analyses 
will be based on the observed cases. For the primary efficacy analysis, every effort will be made from the informed consent form design to clinical foll ow up to reduce the missing data. Patients withdraw consent before 
the primary endpoint can be measured will be replaced.

transfers) will be captured with chart review at Emory University and secondary sites .  Data will be uploaded into 
RedCap .  There will be monthly meetings (tele- conference) with each site’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_515549], enrollment 
and reporting of data.  
 
Publication Plan  
 
The results of the study should be available within [ADDRESS_668093] (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. Regardless of relationship, all AEs will be recorded with start dates occurring any time after patient receives any duvelisib /placebo . At each 
study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolut ion or stabilization.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of e ach epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. Adverse events will be summarized and described within each cohort. 
They will initially be reviewed regardless of attribution, but also whether they are possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that are graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related” to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The incidence of severe adverse events or toxicities will be described. We will assess the proportion of patients who experience grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicity. To assess tolerability, we will also capture 
the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse events.  
 
16.2 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
 
The ICH defines an adverse event as any unfavorable and unintended sign, including laboratory findings, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of an investigational product. Adverse event severity will be graded per the using the CTCAE version 5 for toxicity and adverse event reporting.   
 
Protocol Title :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus  
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 31 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. [ADDRESS_668094] 
to duvelisi b and the outcome of the event. All AE’s will began recording at the beginning of enrollment until 
withdrawal and/or completion of the clinical trial.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is cons idered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchos pasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Study -Specific AE/SAE Reporting  
 
• Due to the wide arr ay of symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_515590][INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19, it is not 
feasible or informative to record and assess all possible symptoms and lab test results for AE/SAE grading in this study. Hence  AE/SAE grading and reporting will be limited to  lab tests that might reflect 
effects of study drug exposure including bilirubin, ALT, ALK PHOS, AST, leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Symptomatic AE/SAE grading and reporting will focus on the following: diarrhea, bradycardia, symptoms requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, symptoms requiring repeat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or death. Non -clinically relevant AEs (Grade 1) will not be included on 
AE logs or AE reporting documents.  
 
Classification of an Adverse Event  
 
Severity of Event  
For both AE’s and SAE’s  the investigator must assess the severity of the event.  The severity of the event will be 
graded based off the patient’s symptoms using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 
Version 5 .0): 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_5x7.
pdf.  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (as in mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions. Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations  
Protocol Title :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus  
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 32 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. 3 30-JUNE -2021  
 
Relationship to Study Intervention  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical judgment. The degree 
of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must 
always be suspect.  
 
Expectedness  
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21190] (AE) is expected or unexpected . 
An expected  adverse event is those that have previously identified resulting from administration of the study 
drug.  These include, but not limited to, AE’s that are listed in the AE list, stated on the informed consent document or listed on the investigator’s brochu re. 
An unexpected adverse event occurs when the nature or severity or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk product’s information (i.e., investigator’s brochure, not listed on the informed consent document).  
 
Documenting Adverse Events  
From the time of treatment until 14 days following cessation of duvelisib/placebo  all adverse events, that begin 
or worsen after informed consent, must be recorded  by [CONTACT_515591] (CRF)/worksheets  
 
The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non -serious adverse events for outcome.  
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the Medical History 
page of the patient’s CRF/worksheet.  
 Adverse events will be assessed and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Grade [ADDRESS_668095] for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life- threatening, death related 
to the AE corresponding respectively to Grades 1 - 5, will be use d. Information about any deaths (related to an 
Adverse Event or not) will also be collected. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive 
questioning of the patient (patient) during the screening process after signing informed consent  and at each visit 
during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_102] (patient) during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as po ssible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
 
1. The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -5)  
2. Its duration (Start and end dates)   
3. Its relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes) or Its relations hip to 
the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes)  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)  
5. Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, co ncomitant 
medication/non -drug therapy)  
6. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as in Section 16.[ADDRESS_668096] been met). 7. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolv ing, recovered/resolved with 
sequelae, fatal, unknown)   
  
Protocol Title :  Duvelisib  Ameliorates  Manifestations of Pneumonia in Established Novel Coronavirus  
Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 33 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. 3 30-JUNE -2021  
If the event worsens the event should be reported a second time in the CRF noting the start date when the event 
worsens in toxicity. For grade 3 and 4 adverse events only, if improvement to a lower grade is determined a new 
entry for this event should be reported in the CRF noting the start date when the event improved from having been Grade 3 or Grade 4.   For phase I studies any AE that constitutes a DLT should be reported like a grade 3 
and 4 adv erse event.  All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non -
drug therapy is given, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  
 
Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resoluti on or until it is judged to be permanent, 
and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an Adverse event in their own right (are considered clinically significant, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy or require changes in study treatment), should be recorded on the Adverse E vents CRF.  
 
Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as adverse events.  
 
A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined below and/or as per investigator’s discretion. A dose -hold or medication for the lab 
abnormality may be required by [CONTACT_217974], by [CONTACT_108], be an adverse event and must be reported as su ch.  Any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, 
including death due to any cause whether or not related to the study drug, must be submitted on an SAE form  
and assessed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_515550], IRB, DSMC, FDA.  
 
All serious adverse events collected during this time frame will also be reported to Verastem.  
 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the adheren ce to be stable. The sponsor -Investigator will be responsible for notifying FDA of any unexpected 
fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days 
after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  
  
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.  
 
Any additional information for the SAE including complications, progression of the initial SAE, and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537]-up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours  of the investigator receiving the 
follow -up information.  
An SAE oc curring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously 
reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
Any SAEs experienced after the reporting period described above should only be reported to FDA/IRB if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment.    
 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form ; all applicable 
sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must 
assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form, and submit the completed form.   
Each reoccurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to that 
event regardless of when it occurs. The follow- up information should describe whether the event has resolved

The IND sponsor will also make an assessment of whether the event constitutes an unanticipated problem posing risks to subjects or others (UP). This assessment will be provided to the Emory University IRB, which, in turn will make a final determination.  If the Emory IRB determines an event is a UP it will notify the appropriate regulatory 
agencies and institutional officials.

16.3 The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) /Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC)  
The Independent Data monitoring Committee  (IDMC ) for this study is a part of the Winship Data Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC functions independently within Winship Cancer Institute to conduct 
internal monitoring functions to ensure that research being conducted by [CONTACT_515592] -quality scientific data in a manner consistent with good clinical practice (GCP) and appropriate 
regulations that govern clinical research. Depending on the risk level of the protocol, the DSMC review may occur every [ADDRESS_668101] 5 subjects being reviewed. Subsequent monitoring will occur in routine intervals per the Winship Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  The  DSMC  will provide 
oversight for the conduct of this study  based upon access to unblinded study data  and will continuously monitor 
cumulative SAE provided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a monthly basis.  A planned analysis for futility will be submitted to the 
DSMC after accrual of [ADDRESS_668102] safety, compliance with the protocol, data 
collection, and risk -benefit ratio. Specifically, the Winship Cancer Institute Internal Monitors assigned to the 
DSMC  may verify , using blinded data,  informed consent, eligibility, data entry, accuracy and availability of source 
documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential regulatory documents. Following the monitoring review, monitors will provide a preliminary report of monitoring findings to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_163789]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_515551]. Prior to the completion of the final summary report, monitors will discuss the preliminary report responses with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515552] (when appropriate). A final monitoring summary report will then 
be prepared by [CONTACT_2037]. Final DSMC review will include the final monitoring summary report with corresponding PI [INVESTIGATOR_163792], submitted CAPA (when applicable), PI [INVESTIGATOR_228415], and available aggregate toxicity and safety data.  The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the overall trial conduct. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_163794]. Continuing Revi ew submissions will include the DSMC recommendation letter. Should any revisions be made to 
the protocol -specific monitoring plan after initial DSMC approval, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515553]. The Committee reserves the rig ht to conduct additional audits if necessary.

summarize all the patient data for subjects actively being treated on the trial as well as a roadmap detailing 
pending tests/treatments for each individual subject. The spreadsheet will be shared with the Emory PI [INVESTIGATOR_67078] e-mail.  
 Winship’s MSC will perform an on -site or remote monitoring visit within the first three months of enrollment of 
the first subject. Quarterly monitoring visits will occur (once annually onsite and three times remotely) until subject follow -up is terminated. Monthly reviews of data in OnCore will be conducted to ensure compliance or 
identify discrepancies; specifically, to assess compliance with the protocol, verify informed consent forms, verify 
compliance with SAE reporting procedures, monitor the tracking of study drug (pharmacy visit, storage and 
accounting of study drug), retrieve regulatory documentation, and perform qu ality control by [CONTACT_515593].  
Study updates will occur at least once monthly between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_333083](s). The purpose of the meetings is to discuss the en rollment, regulatory updates, monitor 
toxicities, and evaluate the progress of the trial. Scheduled teleconferences may stop after all patients have completed assigned protocol therapy. The coordinating center (or designee) will communicate with participat ing 
sites via monthly email. The minutes from the teleconference will be maintained in the regulatory binder for the study. In addition, electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_163797] . 
 
17.   Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants  
Participants will be assured of their voluntary participation in the study, their choice to answer or not answer any question, and the protocol for maintaining confidentiality.  
Participant  confidentiality  is strictly held in  trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and  the sponsor(s) 
and their agents. This confidentiality is  extended to cover  testing of  biological samples and  genetic  tests  in 
addition  to the clinical information relating to participants.  Therefore,  the study  protocol,  documentation,  data, 
and all other  information generated  will be  held  in strict  confidence. No  information  concerning the  study,  or 
the data  will be  released to  any unauthorized third party  without  prior written approval  of the sponsor. 
 The study  monitor,  other authorized representatives  of the  sponsor, representatives  of the IRB  or pharmaceutical 
company supplying study product  may inspect  all documents and records  required to be  maintained by [CONTACT_1275], including but not limited to,  medical records (office,  clinic,  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  and pharmacy  records for 
the participants in this study. The  clinical study  site will permit access  to such  records.  
 The study  participant’s  contact [CONTACT_515594]. At  the end of the  study, all records  will continue to  be kept in  a secure  location for  as long a period as 
dictated by  [CONTACT_515595].  
 
Study participant research  data, which is  for purposes  of statistical analysis  and scientific reporting,  will be 
transmitted to  and stored. This  will not  include the  participant’s  contact  [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, 
individual participants  and their research data will be identified by  a unique study identification number. The

Infection (DAMPEN -CI) 
Page 37 of 47 Protocol Version: VERSION NUMBER 3. [ADDRESS_668104] in person, or by [CONTACT_99444]. The informed consent is an ongoing, 
interactive process rather than a one -time information session. The consent form document is designed to begin 
the informed consent process, which provides the patient with ongoing explanations that will help them make educational decisions about whether to begin or continue participating in the trial. The research team knows that a written document alone may not ensure that the patient fully understands what participation means. Therefore, the research team will discuss with the patient the trial's purpose, procedures, risks and potential benefits, and their rights as a participant. The team will continue to update the patient on any new information 
that may affect their situation.  
 
Consent will be obtained prior to any research -driven procedures. The investigator will assess the patient’s 
capacity during his/her encounters with him or her. The investigator will give the person providing consent (the patient or a legally authorized re presentative) adequate opportunity to read the consent document before it is 
signed and dated.  It will be explained to prospective participants that the study involves research, the purpose 
of the research, the expected duration of participation, as well as the approximate number of participants to be enrolled. The study procedures, and identification of research procedures v. non -research will also be thoroughly 
discussed. It will be explained to participants that participation is voluntary and that the su bject may discontinue 
at any time.  
 Refusal to participate or withdraw will not involve a penalty or loss of benefits to which the participant is otherwise entitled. Refusal will in no way affect the participant's future are. The participant will also be told of 
the possible consequences of the decision to withdraw from the research, and procedures for orderly termination of participation.  
 Any significant new findings developed during the course of the research that may affect the participant's willingnes s to continue to participate will be provided. Also explained will be anticipated circumstances under 
which the subject's participation may be terminated by [CONTACT_515596]'s consent.  
Prospective participants will be provided with a description of any reasonably foreseeable  risks or discomforts as

well as a description of any benefits to the participant or to others that might be reasons expected from the 
research. Alternative procedures or courses of treatment will also be thorough ly discussed.  Prospective 
participants will also be given detailed information describing the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the participant will be maintained and what records may be examined by [CONTACT_16133], IRBs, 
sponsor, their representatives, and possibly the FDA or OHRP.  
 
Also communicated to the participant will be an explanation that emergency medical care will be arranged for a study -related illness or injury, and an explanation of whether funds are set aside to pay fo r this care and/or 
compensation, and if so by [CONTACT_20898] (e.g., sponsor, subject, insurer). The participant is told the source of the study's funding.  All participants will be told of any additional costs that may result from participation in the research . 
 
Non -English -Speaking Participants    
A certified translator/interpreter will be present during the consenting process and this will be documented . All 
questions and concerns will be answered by [CONTACT_515597] s with the aid of a certified 
translator/interpreter.  
An IRB -approved Short Form in that specific language will be used.  We will use what's available on Emory IRB 
website. For the languages that are not available, we will have the short form translated to  that language and 
submit the IRB for review and approval prior to use.  Process to Document Consent in Writing: Winship SOP 2.1:

of Georgia, Morehouse School of Medicine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Children's 
Healthcare of Atlanta, and the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (GACTSA). Emory University researchers received $734 million from external funding agencies in fiscal year 2018, including approximately $441 million in funding from federal agencies, $359 million of this from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  
 Winship Cancer Institute (Winship)  is Georgia's first and only National Cancer Institute (NCI) -designated 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (P30CA138292) and is dedicated to the integration of innovative clinical and basic science research with outstanding patie nt care for the prevention, treatment and control of cancer. First 
designated in 2009, Winship’s NCI designation was renewed in 2012 and 2016, achieving an “outstanding” rating. Winship earned the prestigious Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from th e NCI in 2016, after 
demonstrating that its outstanding programs are reducing the cancer burden on the state of Georgia through research conducted in its laboratories, its clinical trial program, and its population -based science. The 
institutional support for Winship was rated as ‘exceptional’ by [CONTACT_463].  
The Winship Clinic Building C  houses the primary offices and clinical space for cancer services including the 
medical oncology, hematology, and surgical oncology clinics, the radiation oncology program, and the Winship Ambulatory Infusion Center.  In summer 2017, Emory Healthcare completed the expansion of Emory University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515554]. This nine -floor facility adds 144 inpatient beds to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], of which more 
than 80% are dedicated to cancer care. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_515555] -specific

Any protocol modifications will be communicated to all sites with the appropriate regulatory agencies notified for their respective reviews and approvals.  All engaged participating sites will safeguard date, including secure transmission of data, as required by [CONTACT_515598].  All local site investigators will conduct the study in accordance with applicable federal 
regulations and local laws.  All non -compliance with the study protocol or applicable requirements will be 
reported in accordance with local policy.   
 
Site initiation at subsites  
At the time of study initiation at a subsite, the coordinating center multi -site coordinator  (with additional staff 
as needed) will perform a site initiation teleconference. During this teleconference, the Emory team will revie w 
the study, enrollment, reporting, and regulatory compliance.   
Subsite data collection  
Subsite data must be submitted to the coordinating center multi- site coordinator as outlined in the protocol -
specific monitoring plan. The protocol- specific monitoring  plan will be provided by [CONTACT_515599]-
site coordinator to external participating prior to site activation. Access to the coordinating center OnCore database will be provided to external participating sites for direct electronic data entry . All data submitted must 
be accompanied by [CONTACT_37413], where applicable and as outlined in the protocol -specific 
monitoring plan. All data must be entered in the timeframe required at each site, but no later than [ADDRESS_668106] access to the appropriate

Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of human subjects are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct of the trial follows the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
 
Subsite self -monitoring : The participating site will have internal monitoring meetings. These meetings which will 
include the participating site investigator (or designee), the clinical research coordinator and the regulatory affairs coordinator as applicable, will meet at least on a monthly basis to review and discuss study data to ensure subject safety. Chart reviews will be performed on selected cases by [CONTACT_515600], data collection, documentation and completion.  
 
Central monitoring : Study -specific monitoring plans are specified per site, with the only difference between s ites 
whether the site submits source data on paper or provides the coordinating center multi -site team remote access 
to that site’s local electronic medical record.  Centralized monitoring will occur minimally quarterly, no more frequently than monthly. Mo nitoring will be centralized, including data reporting and research sample 
acquisition. The coordinating center multi -site coordinator will perform on -site and/or remote monitoring visit 
within the first three months of enrollment of the first subject. Qua rterly monitoring visits will occur (on site up 
to once per year and at least three times remotely) until subject follow- up is terminated. Monthly reviews of 
data will be conducted to ensure compliance or identify discrepancies; specifically, t o assess com pliance with the 
protocol, verify informed consent forms, verify compliance with SAE reporting procedures, monitor the tracking 
of study drug (pharmacy visit, storage and accounting of study drug), retrieve regulatory documentation, and 
perform quality control by [CONTACT_515601].  
 
Auditing 
For sites with an auditing mechanism in place that are able to share documentation of their auditing standards and processes followed, an agreement may be requested for the site to perform local auditing and provide formal audit reports to the coordinating center.

Cryopreservation with CryoStor Media: 
1. Suspend cells to be cryopreserved using mechanical  or enzymatic dissociation.  
2. Centrifuge cells to obtain cell pellet.  
3. Remove supernatant.  
Note: Remove as much culture medium as possible to reduce dilution of the CryoStor medium.  
4. Isolation - Add cold (2 –8 °C) CryoStor medium to a cell concentratio n range of 0.5 –10x106 cells/ml  
for standard cell culture protocols. A higher cell concentration is possible with testing.  
Note: CryoStor media contain DMSO, no additives are necessary.  
5. Pre -freeze - Incubate cell suspension at 2 –8 °C for ~10 minutes.  
6. Nucleation – Lower sample temperature to –80 °C.  
a. Use a controlled rate freezer ( –1 °C /minute) or similar procedure for most mammalian cell  
systems. 
b. The freezer should be pre -cooled to 2 –8 °C.  
c. Ice nucleation within the sample (seeding)  should be initiated at approximately – 5 °C using  
a liquid nitrogen burst program setting on the controlled rate freezer or mechanical agitation  
(flick or tap) of the cryovial/sample container after 15 –20 minutes at – 80 °C.  
 Alternative Nucleation Procedur es – cells can be frozen using stepwise freezing procedures.  
Stepwise freezing procedures include:  
a. 2 hours at –20 °C followed by 2 hours at – 80 °C or  
b. 3–4 hours at – 80 °C in an isopropanol freezing container. The isopropanol container should be pre -cooled 
to 2–8 °C 
Ice nucleation - mechanical agitation (flick or tap) of the cryovial/sample container after 15 –20 minutes at –
80 °C.  
7. Storage – Store the samples at liquid nitrogen temperatures (below – 130 °C).  
Note: Sample storage at –80 °C is only recom mended.  
8. Thawing - Thaw samples quickly in a 37 °C water bath. Sample should be thawed with gentle swirling of the 
sample until all visible ice has melted. Thaw time for a 1 ml sample in a cryovial is ~3 minutes. Note: DO NOT 
allow sample to warm above c hilled temperatures (0 –10 °C). Cryovials should be cool to the touch when removed 
from the water bath. Passive thaw is not recommended.  
9. Dilute cell/CryoStor mixture immediately with appropriate culture medium. This can be performed in a single 
step. The dilution medium should be between 20 –37 °C. A dilution ratio of 1:10 (sample: medium) or greater is 
recommended.  
10. Plate cells appropriately.  
11. Culture the cells or use immediately.  
 
Shipment:  
Patient samples from secondary sites  will be shipped in r eal-time overnight on Monday -Wednesday so that 
samples will be received no later than Friday. Each sample will be shipped on adequate amounts of dry ice.  Emory University will cover the cost for shipment of the patient samples

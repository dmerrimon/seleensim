10.[ADDRESS_864122]-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis 
(PEP) is the most common, serious complication of ERCP and accounts for a 
significant proportion of morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures accrued in the post procedure setting.
3-[ADDRESS_864123] shown that PEP 
occurs approximately 4- 10% procedures with a mortality rate up to 0.7%.6-[ADDRESS_864124] often performed in the outpatient setting with the expectation for 
patients to be discharged home the same day of the procedure.  Patients are 
often observed for symptoms of complications after procedures. Data suggests prolonged observation (4- 6 hours) captures symptoms indicative of a 
complication in 80% of these patients and consequently prevents un- intended 
discharge with subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].
9 However, a standar dized 
observation protocol for this interval of time is not practical at ERCP centers. 
Given 11% of patients require admission after ERCP and fewer patients 
ultimately are verified as having complications; the majority of centers do not 
have a 4- [ADDRESS_864125] -ERCP care. Moreover, such a 
protocol for all ERCP outpatients would create unnecessary costs, strain on 
recovery room resources (staff, nursing and space), and significant 
inconvenience for patients.[ADDRESS_864126] ERCP pancreatitis to occur in up 25%. [ADDRESS_864127] ERCP pancreat itis demonstrated 
that rate of inappropriate discharge may occur in over 50% of patients. This delay 
in recognition may be clinically important as this represents a missed opportunity 
for timely interventions. For instance,  early intravenous fluid hydratio n after the 
development of pancreatitis can reduce the morbidity and mortality at least 3-
fold.12,[ADDRESS_864128] ERCP pancreatitis is defined by [CONTACT_645489]: characteristic abdominal pain, elevation in serum lipase or amylase three times greater than the upper limit of normal assessed [ADDRESS_864129] been studied; however offer limited accuracy and are by [CONTACT_645490] a rapid, bedside

9-24-19 assessment is not possible given time need for serum collec tion, transport and 
processing.16-19 Also, elevated serum pancreatic enzymes are common in 
asymptomatic patients after ERCP ( up to 75% of patients) with confirmed clinical 
pancreatitis being much less common.20 Therefore, an early diagnostic tool is yet 
to be identified.   
 Trypsinogen is the main proteolytic proenzyme in pancreatic secretions. 
Activation of trypsinogen and other proenzymes is part of the initial pathobiology of acute pancreatitis. Trypsinogen- 2 is an isoenzyme  that peaks at 6 hours with a 
median level of 1790 ug/L in patients with pancreatitis, compared to 3.6ug/L in 
patients without.
21,[ADDRESS_864130], 
serum amylase peaks at 12 hours and lipase 24 hours after pancreatitis. While amylase and lipase are currently the established diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of PEP; the delay in physiologic peak is likely the r eason their utility as 
an early marker for PEP is limited. A urine trypsinogen- 2 dipstick (UTDT) is 
commercially available for purchase ($3.18/unit) with promising studies for accuracy of its cut point for pancreatitis. Trypsinogen- 2 urine testing for PEP 
potentially offers several advantages including an earlier peak concentration, ease of deployment (at the bedside), interpretation (positive/negative test strip) and a low cost.  
 Actim Pancreatitis (Medix Biochemica)  is a urine trypsinogen- [ADDRESS_864131] 
(UTDT)  that uses trypsinogen- 2 as a biomarker for acute pancreatitis. At a 
cutpoint of 50 ug/L it has been assessed in 3 small prospective studies for the 
diagnosis of PEP.
1,25,26 Kemppainen et al.25 demonstrated an adequate 
sensitivity (81%) and specificity (97%) with the UTDT for diagnosing PEP at 6 hours after ERCP in 106 patients. Limit ations include the impracticality of a 6 
hour testing interval after ERCP and unclear inclusion/exclusion criteria. Sankaralingam et al.
26 demonstrated a very high sensitivity (100%) and 
specificity (96%) with the UTDT for diagnosing PEP at 4 hours after ERCP, but was limited by [CONTACT_645491] 29 patients. Tseng et al.
1 demonstrated a 
sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 97%, and a superior accuracy of 96% compared to serum amylase/lipase for the diagnosis of PEP at 3 hours after ERCP  in 150 
patients, but limitations include a high number (100) of excluded patients. A 
meta -analysis of these available studies calculated an overall sensitivity of 86%, 
specificity of 94% and area under the operator curve of 0.92. 
27 However , as 
mentioned above, the published studies suffer from variation in timing of UTDT, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and lack of rigorous study design with adequately powered sampled size. Consequently, further study is needed to assess its accuracy of UTDT in the post ERCP setting.  
 The primary study objective is to determine the test characteristics of UTDT for the diagnosis of PEP [ADDRESS_864132]-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis 
(PEP) is the most common, serious complication of ERCP. More than 500,[ADDRESS_864133] (UTDT)  is a simple, 
inexpensive test with promising preliminary data for accuracy for immediate diagnosis of PEP. Prior studies of ITDT test characteristics lack rigorous scientific 
design.  
 Proposed Study and Methods:  
We will enroll [ADDRESS_864134] and diagnostic UTDT 2 hours after the ERCP will 
be performed. Patients with a positive baseline UTDT will be followed clinic ally as 
part of this study without 2 hour testing. Care providers and study primary investigators will be blinded to the 2 hour UTDT results. Baseline, intra- procedure 
and recovery room clinical data will be recorded. Diagnosis of PEP will be made blinded to the UTDT result. Admission status for PEP will be assessed by [CONTACT_645492]/e- mail contact [ADDRESS_864135] ERCP UTDT for the diagnosis of PEP will be calculated.   
 
Aims:  1) To determine the test characteristics of UTDT for the diagnosis of PEP   
2 hours after completion of ERCP . 2) To identify and describe patients wit h 
baseline UTDT positivity, in whom this test offers limited utility.  
 
Specific Aims:

for the diagnosis of PEP:  
 
Hypotheses:  
1) UTDT is a  sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of PEP  for patients 
undergoing ERCP.  
2) At a cutpoint for a negative test of <50ug/L, UTDT will be accurate at [ADDRESS_864137] is negative.

1.1 To identify and describe patients with baseline UTDT positivity.  
Hypothesis:  
1) A subgroup of  patients will demonstrate baseline positivity for UTDT. Ba sed on 
previous studies, the subgroup is likely to include patients with chronic 
inflammatory or obstructive conditions of the pancreatic duct (pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma, obstructive chronic pancreatitis)1 This subgroup will represent a 
minority (<6%) of outpatients presenting for ERCP. 1

4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
Patients  will be recruited in the pre-procedure area prior to ERCP.   Only patients who 
would be offered ERCP as part of their previously outlined care plan will be 
included in this study. Patients will be screened according to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria described above.   
 
 
5.0 Study Procedur es 
 
Informed Consent :  Eligible patients  will sign an IRB -approved, written informed 
consent  to verify their willingness to participate in this study.  Informed consent 
will be obtained on the day of their scheduled ERCP . Consent for the study will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_645493][INVESTIGATOR_41259]/or a research assistant.  
Patients  will receive a copy of the signed and dated informed consent document. 
Original informed consent documents will be maintained on- file.  A note may be 
made in the subject’s  medical record regarding participation in the research 
study. Once consented and enrolled into the trial, patients  will be issued a unique 
identifier  for the purposes of data entry . 
 Pre-Procedure data and sample collection:   After obtaining informed cons ent,  
patients  will be asked health questions prior  to ERCP to assess and quantify 
current and prior alcohol use, current and prior tobacco use, quantification of narcotic use and quantification of non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) 
use.  Narcoti c and NSAID use in the [ADDRESS_864139] ERCP .  Subjects 
will be shown the study pain scale (appendix 1) and asked to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] a number on the scale to rate their  abdomial  pain at baseline and post ERCP.  Amount and 
type of IV fluids given Pre- ERCP may be collected.  Post- ERCP Pain scores will 
be attempted [ADDRESS_864140] –ERCP, but if necessary may be collected prior to 
the [ADDRESS_864141] – ERCP time point up to the time of patient discharge by [CONTACT_645494].    
  Data will be collected on the indication of ERCP, history of acute pancreatitis, 
recurrent acute pancreatitis, or chronic pancreatitis, history of pancreatic surgery, 
presence of peri -pancreatic fluid collecti on and prior sphincterotomy . Data will 
also be collected to note if subjects underwent an endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_645484]. Prior imaging may 
be reviewed for the presence of pancreatic mass and/or pancr eatic duct 
obstruction.  
 Baseline tests may  be obtained prior to undergoing ERCP including serum 
pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase), serum liver enzymes, and coagulation profile,  as is the standard for our endoscopy unit.  Available o utpatient laboratory  
data with in 48-[ADDRESS_864142] ERCP urine collection has been completed, these patients 
will not be contact[CONTACT_387532] 5 day and 30 day follow -up call and their data will not 
be included in the final analysis.      
 Patients with baseline, pre- procedure positivity for UTDT (> or = 50ug/L) will 
undergo all study procedures as outlined below with the exception of [ADDRESS_864143]- ERCP 
testing  will be considered a study screen failure. Subjects who provided a 
baseline urine sample will still be included in the final analysis of baseline UTDT 
level.  Subjects who are excluded due to the inability to access the ampulla at 
ERCP will also still be  Included in the final analysis of baseline UTDT level.  
  Intra -procedural Data Collection:  Patients will undergo ERCP as intended . All 
clinical decisions and endoscopic interventions prior to, during and after ERCP will be performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Data on all ERCP  
procedure findings  and in terventions including,  duration of procedure, placement 
of pancreatic or biliary duct stents, ERCP maneuvers deployed for cannulation 
(e.g. needle knife), findings associated with chronic pancreatit is (e.g  pancreatic 
duct stones ), pancreatic duct leak, per i-procedural NSAIDs administration and 
any immediate complications including perforation, bleeding, or hemodynamic 
instability will be recorded.  Amount  and type  of intraoperative IV fluids may be  
collected.  
  Immediate Postoperative Care, D ata and Sample  collection:  At our institution, 
patients  typi[INVESTIGATOR_645485] [ADDRESS_864144] –ERCP, but  if 
necessary  may be collected  prior to  the [ADDRESS_864145] – ERCP  time point  up to the 
time of  patient  discharge by [CONTACT_645495].  Patients, study 
investigators, ERCP care team, nursing staff  will be blinded to the results. The 
statistician will be blinded to the urine trypsinogen- [ADDRESS_864146] during statistical 
analysis.

The decision to admit/monitor the patient will be left to the discretion of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541]  / ERCP care team and will occur blinded to the UTDT results . Data 
regarding symptoms (e.g. nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain scores),  anti –emetic 
use and narcotic s administered for pain symptoms, duration in recovery and 
decision to admit or discharge will be recorded.  Volume and type of IV fluids  
administered in recovery may also be collec ted. Patients will receive a risk 
assessment for post -ERCP pancreatitis . This will calculated and tracked for the 
purposes of this study.  
    Follow Up Data Collection: Patients who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645486] . Patients who are discharged to home/other after ERCP will be 
contact[CONTACT_300747]/ or email 5 days  (+  4 days or – 2 days)  and 30 days   
( + or – 10 days) after the ERCP by a study team member  to deter mine whether 
PEP occurred and was managed outside of our institution.  Patients will be asked 
about ERCP procedure complications such as infection, bleeding, perforation and death.  This contact [CONTACT_645496], email or text message. Subjects 
will be a sked for their preferred method of contact [CONTACT_645497].   Records 
confirming post ERCP pancreatitis will be requested if the patient is admitted and/or initially  managed at an outside institution for PEP . Patients without 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_645487] s attributable to post ERCP pancreatitis will be 
classified as not having developed PEP.  Records pertaining to any ERCP 
procedure complications will also be requested.  
 PEP will be defined by [CONTACT_645498] . The ERCP team will be blinded 
to the UTD T result  when determining PEP.  
 Clinical data regarding volume and type of IV fluids administered at 24, 48 hours 
of admission and severity of pancreatitis (based on Cotton criteria, Modified Marshall Score and graded presence of necrosis) will  be assessed  recorded  for 
all patients admitted with PEP .

9-24-19 6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk 
to Participants  or Others  
  
 An adverse event  will be considered a  complication that occurred due to the 
collection of urine for testing or administration of health questions. Associated 
adverse event s will be reported to the IRB per  the IRB reporting criteria.   
 
 
  Stud y Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
Patients  may withdraw from the study at any time upon their request. Data collected 
prior to their withdrawal may still be used in the final analysis.   
 
7.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Descriptive statistics will be performed for all continuous variables (mean ± 
standard deviation for normally distributed variables and median ± interquartile range for non- normal variables) and categorical variables (count and proportion).  
Categorical outcomes will be analyzed using Χ
[ADDRESS_864147] or Fish er’s test for small 
samples.  Comparison of group outcomes will be analyzed using Student’s t test for normally distributed data and nonparametric Wilcoxon- Mann -Whitney test for 
data that violate the normality assumption. Univariate logistic regression analysis will be used to identify predictors of interest and multiple predictor analysis will estimate effects adjusted for covariates. 
 
Diagnostic test characteristics including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value, negative predictive value, and accuracy will be assessed for the UTDT in 
diagnosing PEP and for different severity levels of PEP. In addition, the UTDT will be assessed in predicting additional outcomes as outlined above.   Specific pre- procedure, intra- procedure, or post -procedure characteristics as 
noted above will be assessed in univariate and multivariable regression models to assess whether they contribute to the inaccurate diagnosis of PEP based on the UTDT. Similar multivariable regression analysis will be done to assess for additional risk factors of PEP.  
 A cost analysis will also be performed to determine the number of UTDT strips needed to prevent one inadvertent discharge of a patient with PEP.  
 
 
8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Each subject will be assigned a unique study number.  Study material will be kept 
on a limited number of password protected computer stations, and paper records 
will be kept in locked cabinets/offices in areas with limited public access.  Study material will be retained until seven years after study closure, at which point records will be destroyed, and hard drives containing study data will be erased.

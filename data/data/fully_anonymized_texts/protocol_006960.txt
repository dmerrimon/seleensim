The study has three specific aims:  
1. Using a full factorial design, compare whether park use and population physical activity in low-income neighborhoods increase with the availability of a) more organized physical 
activity classes, including Zumba, line dancing, and aerobics indoors and outdoors, 
and/or b) a loyalty program approach that rewards frequent park users.  
2. Determine whether either of these two approaches changes the perception of park safety and neighborhood safety.  
3. Identify the cost effectiveness of both appro aches in terms of dollars spent to generate 
increased physical activity in parks as measured through systematic observation.  
 
This manual describes study protocols and instruments  specific to this study. The full SOPARC 
manual is not included here; however, a brief summary of how it is implemented is described in the 
Data Collection section. Similarly, only the steps in Pendragon Forms VI that necessary for project 
functioning are described here. The full manual is available for download from the vendor website 
(http://www.pendragonsoftware.com/
). 
 
[ADDRESS_271] party software  and hardware used are described briefly below. Each will be discussed in greater detail 
in later sections describing their use.  
Apple iPad Mini  
All data collection instruments will be fielded on this device. These are 16GB, WiFi- enabled ( i.e., no 
data plan) devices. Each Mini includes one USB wall charger. Manuals and other documentation are available online.  
These devices are not linked to an iTunes or iCloud account, email account, or calendar. Data collectors should be instructed not to link them to any  accounts or access iTunes or iCloud on these 
devices. RAND has logged each of these devices and has the serial numbers and equipment numbers on file.  
Setup and daily care  
These devices are not to be opened in any way, and settings should be managed by [CONTACT_543]. Outside of settings that affect immediate use (e.g.,  brightness, volume) field staff 
should be instructed not to alter settings to avoid any interruption of Pendragon or the other project applications.  
IPads are to be charged the night before use in the field using the Apple charger only. Whenever possible a surge protector should be used.  
Pendragon Forms VI  
This software allows the user to create custom data collection forms that are output in HTML5 applications that run while disconnected from a network. Data collected on the handhelds are synchronized into Microsoft Access. All data will be entered in one of five  form s created in this 
application.  
Park Counters  
These applications were developed by [CONTACT_544],  and are standalone counter 
applications that observers will use to record park utilization. There are two  park counters , one 
records gender, age, and activity level, and one  record s gender by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity. See Appendix A 
for a screenshot and further de scription of each counter.  
Equipment Management and Distribution  
The RAND supplied field laptop (Dell E6410), iPads not in use, and park folders will be stored at AltaMed. Promotoras are to charge their own iPad overnight after conducting park observations , or 
drop off at AltaMed for charging if they are not scheduled to work in parks.  
DATA COLLECTION  
The two primary pi[INVESTIGATOR_501]. Observations are conducted according to SOPARC protocols, on three weekdays an d three weekend days spread over 
6 
 five to six months. Observations occur three times per day at 3 -hour intervals (e.g., 12pm, 3pm, 
6pm). A team of two promotoras  is assigned to collect data at a park, though at the beginning of the 
data collection phase two  teams of two were assigned for reliability assessment purposes.  
Prior to beginning data collection project managers will visit each park and create a target area map 
(see appendix B for a park mappi[INVESTIGATOR_500]). On the first day of data collection a project  manager 
meets the team at the park to review the park map and deliver any needed equipment and/or materials. On subsequent data collection days a project manager will meet the team if they have not observed at that park previously, otherwise the team will proceed according to the schedule and 
data collection protocols.  
There are two primary types of interviews; targeted park user interviews (people in the park) and randomly selected residents (people living within one mile of the park). If promotoras  are unable to 
contact [CONTACT_546], safety, or other reasons, station interviews will be conducted. Station interviews are administered to a convenience sample of individuals who are recruited at high pedestrian spots (e.g., transit stations, storefronts, etc.) in neighborhoods within 
one mile of the park. The same instrument is used for the three types of interviews (see appendices 
C and D for English and Spanish versions).  Data collectors will record an observed body type for each 
respondent using an image of body type categories (see appendix E).  
Participant Recruitment and Protection 
In order to obtain random samples, park user and household interview respondents are recruited 
according to established protocols. Park users are recruited according to set quotas aimed at gaining participants equally distributed by [CONTACT_547], activity level,  and age. Household respondents are 
recruited using a random selection of residential addresses. Recruitment protocols for both interview types can be found in appendices F and G. 
Data collectors will obtain oral consent (appendix H ) prior to administering  the interview, and 
provide a small incentive upon completion.  They also will have available a project summary sheet (in 
English and Spanish) that lists the project managers contact [CONTACT_548] (appendix I ).  If a respondent appears in need of immediate mental health 
services , data collectors will provide contact [CONTACT_549] 
(appendix J) and inform park staff.  
Park Use Counters  
The 12 -button age/activity counter app is designed to capture the number of park users by [CONTACT_550], i.e., observers will record physical activity and age group simultaneously for each individual park user within a defined target area. The app is for counting purposes only and  
the data must be entered into a separate Pendragon form described below.  
The counter consists of 12 buttons arranged in four columns (age group) and three rows (activity 
level). Buttons are color coded by [CONTACT_551].  
On the bottom of the app screen are su mmary and other functions including:  
1. Observation Count:  Returns a summary of the current counts.  
2. Reset Counters: Returns all fields to a [ADDRESS_272]: Allows the observer to edit the immediately preceding entry . 
[ADDRESS_273] the device to  a wireless network.  
2. Open Safari on the device and navigate to http://mmicdata.rand.org/parkcounter . 
3. Tap the ‘Age/Activity’ tab.  
 
 
 
     
 
    
4. After arriving to the counter screen, tap the  save icon on the toolbar, and choose “Add to 
Home Screen.”  This will install the icon on the home screen.  
a. At this point you may choose to change the icon label, which will appear on the screen next to the icon. For this project the icon is labeled ‘Age / Activity’.  
 
 
         
 
  

[ADDRESS_274] each individual according to the established SOPARC protocol.  
3. When the scan is complete , tap the ‘Observation Count ’ tab to view the recorded data . 
4. Enter the data into a data entry form.  
5. Tap the ‘Reset Counter ’ tab to erase counts and  return all fields to a 0 value.  
6. Proceed to the next scan . 
a. The next scan  may be a different target area or a different gender, depending on how 
observations are structured.  
The 8 -button counter race/ethnicity app is designed to capture the number of park u sers by [CONTACT_552]/ethnicity, i.e., observers will record gender and race/ethnicity simultaneously for each 
individual park user within a defined target area. The app is for counting purposes only and the data must be entered into a separate Pendragon  form described below.  
The counter consists of eight buttons arranged in four columns (race/ethnicity) and two rows (gender). Buttons are color coded by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity.  
On the bottom of the app screen you will find the same summary and other functions included in the 12 -button counter:  
1. Observation Count:  Returns a summary of the current counts.  
2. Reset Counters: Returns all fields to a [ADDRESS_275]: Allows the observer to edit the immediately preceding entry . 
The installation instructions for this counter are the same as described above for the 12 -button  
counter , except for upon arriving to the installation website, tap the ‘Gender/Ethnicity’ tab.

there are no individuals in a given group, leave the field blank.  
Scan Complete : Check this box at the end of each target area scan. Tap the “End” tab  after 
checking the box.  
Survey/Entrevista  
The English and Spanish versions of the survey are separate forms in Pendragon. Interviewers are 
required to enter the name [CONTACT_583]. Therefore, there will be a single Survey form and a single Entrevista form that will be used across all parks.  
The full survey is available in the appendices.  Highlighted here are some fields that will assist with 
data management.  
Park user activity level: Choose either Active or Sedentary to indicate the level of activity of the 
park user survey respondent. This field is completed for park user surveys only.  
Partial Survey: This check box is located on the final screen of the Survey/Entrevista form. Check 
this box if you begin a survey, but are unable to complete it for any reason (e.g., participant chooses to end it early). If you complete the full survey leave this box unchecked.  
Full survey completed : Check this box if you administer the full survey, even if the participant 
chooses not to answer some of the questions. If you checked the Partial Survey box, do not check this box.  
Environmental scan 
This form is used to provide an overall impression of the park after each park scan is com plete ( e.g., 
3x/day). Only one person from the team needs to enter the data , but team members should discuss 
the items as needed to come to an accurate assessment.  
Observers are required to enter the name [CONTACT_584]. Therefore, there will b e a 
single Environmental scan form that will be used across all parks.  
The environmental scan form contains the following data fields.  
Date and Time: Check to ensure that the proper date and time  are displayed . 
Park name: [CONTACT_585] . 
Your name :  [CONTACT_586] . 
Weather : Mark ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for each of the four items listed below : 
• Windy  
• Pleasant  
• Too cold  
• Too hot  
Safety : Mark ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for each of the four items listed below : 
• Conflict (fight)  
• Gang members  
11 
 • Stray dogs  
• Intoxicated people  
• People smoking  
• Intimidating groups of people  
Homeless : Choose the appropriate range to indicate the number of homeless persons present in 
the park during the scan.  
Are there food/drink/snack vendors IN the park ? Mark ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to indicate whether there 
are food vendors selling food or drinks inside the park boundaries.  
Are there food/drink/snack vendors AROUND the park ? Mark ‘ Yes’ or ‘No’ to indicate whether 
there are food vendors selling food or drinks outside  the park boundaries, but in the adjacent 
area (e.g., on the surrounding sidewalk).  
Is there major construction or maintenance at the park ? Mark ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to indicate whether  
there is significant construction underway that prohibits accessibility to some target areas.  
Marketing materials seen in the park: Mark ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to indicate if the items below are seen 
around the park.  
• Banners  
• Posters  
• Signes  
Complete : Check the box to complete the scan.  
Path scan  
This form is only created for those parks that have a walking/running path or track that will be 
observed as a whole, rather than being included in target areas.  
The form is designed to be completed once in its entirety for  each park user who passes the 
counting station during the assigned counting period. The observer should open this form as soon as the counting period begins.  
Each park that has a walking path/track will have a unique path scan form so that path scan data is 
stored in park specific Access tables. Path scan data are not tagged with a park identifier so it is very 
important that the correct path scan form is used.  
The path scan  form contains the following data fields.  
Date : Check to ensure that the correct date is displayed . 
Time : Check to ensure that the correct time is displayed.  
Check below if no people are observed: Check this box only if no park users passed the counting 
station during the assigned time period.   
• Note : If no persons pass the counting station during the counting period, the observer 
should not advance past this first screen during the counting period.  
Male : Check this box if the person being recorded is male.  
Female : Check this box if the person being recorded is female.  
Child : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 0 -12 years.  
12 
 Teen : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 13 -20 years.  
Adult : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 21 -59 years.  
Senior : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 60 + years.  
Latino : Check this box if the person being recorded is Latino/Hispanic.  
Black : Check this box if the person being recorded is black.  
White: Check this box if the person being recorded is white.  
Other : Check this box if the person being recorded is  another race.  
Walk : Check this box if the person being recorded is walking when s/he passes the counting 
station.  
Run: Check this box if the person being recorded is running when s/he passes the counting 
station . 
Bike : Check this box if the person being recorded is on a bike when s/he passes the counting 
station.  
Skate: Check this box if the person being recorded is skating (e.g., skates, skateboard) when s/he 
passes the counting station.  
Sedentary : Check this box if the person being recorded is sedentary when s/he passes the 
counting station (e.g., being pushed in a stroller or wheelchair).  
END : Check this box after each person is recorded.  
Fitness Zone scan 
This form  is created for those parks that have Fitness Zone(s). Parks may have a single Fitness Zone 
(FZ) or there may be multiple FZs distributed throughout  the park or around a walking path. Fitness 
Zone equipment is often re latively new (since 2009 or so), has m oving parts, and is designed such 
that users will use their own body weight as resistance. Sand areas containing older, non- moving 
equipment are most often not observed as FZs.  
This form is designed to be completed in its entirety for each individual in th e FZ space. If there is 
more than one person using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_502], the form should be completed for each individual 
separately. Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_503], and as ordered in the form.  
Each FZ also s hould have an entry for Other, which is used to record individuals who are in the FZ 
space but not using the equipment at the moment of observation. Individuals in the FZ but not using 
equipment are recorded after all FZ equipment has been observed. There should be an entry for Other even if there are no relevant park users to record.  
The FZ scan  form contains the following data f ields.  
Date : Check to ensure that the correct date  is displayed.  
Time : Check to ensure that the correct time is displayed.  
Statio n ID: Choose the appropriate pi[INVESTIGATOR_504] -down menu. The order in 
which equipment is listed in the menu should match the order indicated on the park map, and is the order in which each pi[INVESTIGATOR_505].  
13 
 Check below if no people are observed: Check this box if the pi[INVESTIGATOR_506].  
Male : Check this box if the person being recorded is male.  
Female : Check this box if the person being recorded is female.  
Child : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 0 -12 years.  
Teen : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 13 -20 years.  
Adult : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 21 -59 years.  
Senior : Check this box if the person being recorded is aged 60+ years.  
Latino : Check this box if the person being recorded is Latino/Hispanic.  
Black : Check this box if the person being recorded is black.  
White: Check this box if the person being recorded is white.  
Other : Check this box if the person being recorded is ano ther race.  
Sedentary : Check this box if the person being recorded is sedentary at the moment of 
observation.  
Moderate : Check this box if the person being recorded is moderately active at the moment of 
observation.  
Vigorous : Check this box if the person bei ng recorded is vigorously active at the moment of 
observation.  
Is the person using the equipment for exercise : Check this box if the person being observed  is 
using the equipment for exercise rather than play or lounging (e.g., sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_507]) . This box should not be checked if a person is resting between sets if s/he appears to 
have been using it for exercise.  
END : Check this box after each person is recorded.  
DATA RELIABILITY  
In addition to the ongoing monitoring of data collection by [CONTACT_553], we will conduct two separate measurements of data reliability. At the project beginning two teams of promotoras will collect data side by [CONTACT_554] s ets, which will be used to  analy ze data 
collector agreement on a select combination of the observed variables. The second and continuous 
assessment of data reliability will compare pi[INVESTIGATOR_508]. This is explained further b elow.  
Target Area Pi[INVESTIGATOR_509] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a single target area during each complete park scan, which will serve as reliability checks of the observation data. The specific target area of which the pi[INVESTIGATOR_511], so the park maps will indicate which target area should be 
photographed. Photos should be taken using the iPad camera from a distance that captures the entire target area, and from which identification of park users is not possible.

 Image file transfer and storage  
RAND staff will manage the transfer of pi[INVESTIGATOR_512]…  
DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data Protection 
Data collection will adhere  to protocols established by [CONTACT_555]. See appendix K for the Data Safety 
and Management Plan.  
Field Logs  
Data collectors will keep a running log of all interviews attemp ted and administered in order to track 
progress and allow calculation of  a response rate. Paper logs are used for this purpose and are kept 
in a folder created for each park, which data collectors are to carry with them  on all data collection 
days. Park fo lders are to be stored at AltaMed when not in use at a park. RAND staff will update 
folders as needed. See a ppendi x L for the log template.  
Data collected on these logs are entered into two spreadsheets stored on the project Teamspace 
site, and can be used  to track progress and calculate refusal rates.  
Pendragon Forms VI  
Initiation  
The Pendragon interface was loaded onto each iPad at AltaMed using a dedicated project router and 
network called Rand Wireless. This network has the static IP address [IP_ADDRESS] . See appendix M 
for instructions on setting the IP address.  
Steps for loading the Pendragon interface are as follow:  
1. Connect the iPad to a wireless network . 
2. Open a web browser on the iPad. 
3. Enter the URL http://www.[IP_ADDRESS]:8080/formsvi . 
4. Tap the INSTALL/RUN link on the resulting Pendragon Forms screen . 
5. Tap the ‘Setup’ tab and enter the username (i.e., name [CONTACT_587]), and the password “parks .” 
6. Tap ‘OK’ to return to the Pendragon Forms  synchronization page . 
7. Add this page to the home screen as an icon, and then close the browser . 
8. While the device is still connected to the internet, open Pendragon Forms using the icon just created in step 7 .  
9. Tap the ‘Sync’ tab, and if  prompted enter the same username [CONTACT_588] 5 . 
a. This step is critical as it establishes the connection with the laptop, and stores the forms in the local browser cache allowing them to function in offline mode. The forms will not 
work offline and data will not sync if this step is skipped.  
10. Press the ‘Launch’ tab to return to the main Pendragon Forms screen, where you will see 
any forms that have been synced . 
[ADDRESS_277] be assigned to each device. To create a new User click the ‘Users’ tab in 
the Pendragon Forms Manger to open the Pendragon Transfer Agent (PTA) dialogue box.  
 
Next, click the ‘Create New User’ tab in the PTA  (see preceding image), which will open fields in 
which you will enter the New User Name [CONTACT_589]. The user name [CONTACT_590] 5 of Initiation. Click the ‘Add’ tab to complete the process. Repeat for all devices.  
Form freezing  
Before a form can be fielded it must be frozen, which locks it for editing and creates an Access table in which data will be stored. Once frozen only a limited amount of editing is possible; see the full Pendragon manual for further discussion of this process (the manual is available as a free PDF 
download from the Pendragon website).  
To freeze a form, highlight it in the Pendragon Forms Manger (PFM) and then click the ‘Properties’ tab to open the Form Properties dialogue box. Next, click the ‘Freeze Form design for distribution to 
handheld and create database’ tab. Click ‘Yes’ when prompted, and ‘OK’ to complete the freezing process. 

16 
  
Form distribution  
Once frozen, the form can be distributed (i.e., prepared for assignment to a group as described 
below). To distribute a form simply highlight it in the Form Designs list and click the ‘Distribute’ tab. Note that if a form is not frozen the ‘Distribute’ tab will be grayed out indicating that it cannot yet be distributed (as in the i mage above).  
Creating groups  
Pendragon uses Groups to send distributed forms to devices, and sync data from devices back to the database. Devices included in a group will receive all forms that are assigned to the same group during the sync process. This p roject uses a single group called Parks that contains all forms and all 
devices. To create a new group, click the ‘Groups’ tab to open the PTA. Scroll down past where users were created in the preceding step and click the ‘Create New Group’ tab, which will  open a field in 
which you will enter the group name. Click the ‘Add’ tab to complete the process.  

17 
  
Once the group has been created you will see the new group listed in the Groups section of the PTA. 
Click on the newly created group to add users and fo rms. All users and distributed forms will be 
available for adding to the group.  
Data Sync (iPad to laptop)  
Data will be synced at AltaMed by [CONTACT_553], with the AltaMed promotora supervisor serving as a 
backup. Data typi[INVESTIGATOR_513].  
The data sync process is as follows:  
1. Plug in router to power source . 
2. Connect Ethernet cable from router to the RAND laptop, which will begin to broadcast the 
Rand Wireless network . 
3. Connect a device to the Rand Wireless network . 
4. Open Pendragon Forms  on the device . 
5. Tap the Sync tab, which will begin the data transfer . 
Note: if any form revisions/updates are completed prior to the data transfer, distributed forms will be sent to the iPads during this same sync.  
 

[ADDRESS_278] be exported and transferred to 
RAND via a secure file sharing service (i.e., Accellion). Access to this site is available on an individual 
basis.  
There are two steps to the data transfer process, which are explained separately below.  
Data export  
Pendragon can export data in .xls, .txt, or .csv format. Data are exported one form (i.e., one Access 
data table) at a time. To export to Excel, which this project does, open Pendragon on the laptop, highlight the form t o be exported, and click on the ‘To Excel’ tab in the PFM.  

19 
  
Data normally will be exported on a weekly basis, for each park that was observed since the 
preceding data transfer was completed. In addition to the park specific forms, the Entrevista (All Parks), Survey (All Parks), and Environmental scan (All Parks) should be exported.  
Resulting data files should be named in a consistent fashion, as shown below.  
Survey: Survey_mmddyy (e.g., Survey_093013)

 Appendix B: Park mappi[INVESTIGATOR_515] ( i.e., a distinct, scannable space ) that 
represent all standard locations likely to provide opportunities for park users to be physically active. 
These areas will be predetermined and identified for observations prior to baseline as sessments. A 
map is created to identify areas and a standard observation order for each park. It is important to 
establish the Target Area map prior to initiating the observations.  
During occasions of high user density, Target Areas can be subdivided into  smaller Subtarget Areas 
(scan spaces) so that more accurate measures can be obtained (e.g., separate groups of people 
using opposite ends of a soccer field provide observation challenges without separating the areas). Observers use standard court or field  markings or other environmental features to determine 
appropriate Subtarget Areas within each Target Area. Data from these smaller spaces are summed to provide an overall measure for each Target Area.  
NOTE: A decision to subdivide a Target Area depends upon (1) the number of park users in the area, and (2) the type of user activity. Fast moving activities with people clustered together and moving in diverse directions (e.g., during soccer) require smaller scan spaces.  
The goal of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_516], observable sections (i.e., Target Areas) so that 
accurate park user counts can be made according to  SOPARC protocols . A well -defined Target Area 
is one that can be scanned from left to right without encountering visual obstructions. They should be a size that makes it possible county all individuals within the area accurately. Observing parks without clearly mapped Target Areas can result in inconsistent counting and lower quality data.  
Preparation 
1. Find out if the park or the parks and rec reation department has an existing map.  
2. Print a satellite image of the park from an online mappi[INVESTIGATOR_517] (e.g., Google Earth, Google 
Maps).  
a. The print out should show all areas of the park to be included in the observations.  
b. Keep in mind that the image may b e out of date or missing some features. Additionally, tree 
coverings may obscure some important features of interest. Nonetheless, this satellite image should provide an outline and general layout of the park and be a good place to start.  
3. Get a feel for th e layout of the park and how it is used.  
a. Take a walk around the park and note the general layout and major features.  
b. Look around to see if there are obvious sections or dividers that can help to define Target Areas.  
c. Note which parts of the park are the mos t and least used.  
d. Make note of any unique park features that may need to be considered for data collection.  
Defining Target Areas  
1. A target area is a space in which activities may occur. A target area should be large enough to accommodate activity, but sma ll enough to accurately count everyone who may be using the 
area.  
24 
 2. Areas of the park that generally are open to the public for use should be observed. Areas not 
intended for public use or that would be inappropriate for observation (e.g., storage space, st aff 
offices, restrooms) should not be included in SOPARC observations.  
3. There is no established minimum or maximum number of Target Areas, nor is there a defined size limit for a Target Area. Parks with large numbers of Target Areas may require more than 
one observer working simultaneously.  
4. Data collectors need to be able to move efficiently from area to area during an observation 
rotation.  
5. Data collectors should be able to observe the entire Target Area from one spot on the ground, and be able to scan fro m left to right without visual obstruction.  
6. If possible, each Target Area should be made up of one primary feature (e.g., Lawn, Sidewalk, Basketball Court, Play area, Gym, Classroom). This permits the aggregation of data for similar Target Areas within the  same park or across parks. However, this may not always be possible, 
and some areas may have mixed characteristics (e.g., Lawn and Sidewalk).  
a. When you enter Target Areas with mixed characteristics into the SOPARC online app, name 
[CONTACT_591].  
7. Existing boundaries (e.g., chalk lines on fields, tree lines, fences) can help determine a Target 
Area.  
a. Keep in mind that Target Areas need to remain the same throughout the observation periods and that chalk lines may be temporary and  may change from one sport or season to 
the next.  
8. Activity types can also be used to help define Target Areas. For example, a tree- shaded section 
of a large green space could be divided into a separate Target Area since one might expect to observe people h aving pi[INVESTIGATOR_518], rather than 
running around or playing a sport as in the open space.  
Ordering Target Areas  
1. Order Target Areas such that the data collector can move clockwise through the park efficiently.  
2. It may be possible to observe multiple Target Areas from a single point – order them 
accordingly.  
3. By [CONTACT_559], begin observation rotations in the gymnasium, auditorium, community center, or comparable indoor space if there is one.  
a. If there is no gymnasium,  begin observations at the most prominent indoor space (or 
outdoor if there are no indoor areas).  
b. If there are no indoor facilities intended for public use, begin with the most prominent 
outdoor area (e.g., basketball court, baseball or soccer field, pi[INVESTIGATOR_519]).  
4. Avoid having data collectors go into dangerous park areas. If these areas are to be observed, do 
this from a safe distance.  
Drawing the Map  
[ADDRESS_280] prominent outdoor park feature (e.g., basketball court, soccer field, pi[INVESTIGATOR_519]).  
2. Proceed from the first outdoor Target Area in a clockwise fashion and continue to add Target 
Areas until all of the park area to be observed has been included in a Target Area.  
3. If the park does have indoor facilities, begin with the main park building. Draw in any targeted 
indoor areas, as only the exterior of the building will be shown on a satellite image. Indicate all indoor spaces (e.g., classrooms, hallways, lobbies) on the map. As much as possible, they should be ordered in such a way that the data collector can move efficiently through t he Target Areas 
without having to retrace his/her steps.  
a. When ordering the indoor Target Areas keep in mind the entrances and exits that can be used to reach other Target Areas.  
b. If a room has more than one entrance, check to see which is most commonly use d and 
accessible.  
4. Include non -activity areas on the map to help the data collector locate Target Areas. Number 
the Target Areas, beginning with the gymnasium (or other prominent indoor space if there is no gymnasium).  
5. When all indoor spaces have been added to the map and numbered exit the building through the main entrance and begin to draw in the outdoor Target Areas. Continue to add Target Areas until all park areas are represented on the map.  
6. See notes below on how to create Target Areas from common outdoor spaces.  
7. Landscaped areas are generally not observed as individual Target Areas (except for gardens with paths or that are designed for use).  
a. Landscapi[INVESTIGATOR_520]. For example, a green space with 
landscaped borders might b e one Target Area.  
8. If there is a walking path or trail it should be marked on the map as a single Target Area, not 
divided and included as a part of other Target Areas.  
a. Refer to the SOPARC manual for instructions on how to observe walking paths and trails.  
9. Choose a single point from which the walking path will be observed during every observation. It should be unobstructed, shaded if possible, and in a spot from which yo u will likely see all 
individuals using the walking path.  
Below are notes on common, individual park areas:  
Lawns and Other Undefined Green Spaces  
People can use green space for diverse purposes (from sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_521]) and in varying numbers 
(one to hu ndreds of people). Since these areas are of mixed use it can be difficult to obtain an 
accurate count if they are too large. It is generally best to divide them into smaller, more 
manageable Target Areas, even though they may be vacant frequently.  
1. Use nat ural boundaries to delineate these Target Areas as much as possible.  
26 
 2. In the absence of obvious boundaries (e.g., fence), use trees, bushes, light posts, tables, and 
other immovable objects to help create boundaries.  
a. In addition to defining Target Area boundaries, these objects can help a data collector determine where he/she is on the map, but can also clutter the map unnecessarily. Be judicious in what is included on the map.  
3. If the area is hilly, it may be necessary to further divide it so that the space  can be observed 
without obstruction.  
4. Use shade to help define Target Areas.  
a. If one section of a large green space often is shaded and another is not, try to keep them separate as the amount of shade available often affects usage.  
Sidewalks  
Sidewalks gener ally are used for traveling from point A to B. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_522] a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_523] a lawn or pi[INVESTIGATOR_524]. You may find sidewalks that encircle a play area, basketball court, or other area designed for a specific activity. These sidewalks 
can be their own Target Area or may be included with the sport or activity specific area. Some things 
to consider in making this decision is whether a Target Area including the sidewalk would be too large to accurately observe, and whether the sidewalk might be an expected spectator area (remember that spectators only exist during organized activities, so this most often wou ld not apply 
to play areas).  
1. Decide if there is a route that often is used as a walking or jogging path. If so, consider doing a walking path scan for this Target Area.  
a. If you choose to do a walking path observation using sidewalks as the walking path, do  not 
include these sidewalks as additional Target Areas.  
2. As sidewalks are normally well- defined, simply divide them into manageable sections so that 
they can be observed accurately.  
3. When deciding how much of a sidewalk to include in a Target Area, keep in mind that people 
often will be moving in two different directions.  
Play Areas  
These areas are usually well- defined, so unless they are unusually large or have structures that 
obstruct vision keep them as a single area. It can be helpful to identify markers  (e.g., lampposts, 
benches) so that data collectors can create Subtarget Areas on the fly if needed.  
Sport Related Courts and Spaces  
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a sport related court or space depends largely on the size and kind of court. Unless separated visually, multiple tennis courts potentially can be grouped together as one Target Area as 
not many individuals play at one time. Unless they are rarely used, neighboring basketball or volleyball courts usually should not be combined, as they may involve many more people and  
vigorous activity levels than can be easily counted.  
Sport and Multi -use Fields  
[ADDRESS_281] how the area should be defined.  
5. Areas surrounding fields may contain benches or grass that is often  used by [CONTACT_560]. Before 
beginning to observe the park, determine which part of a Target Area is considered the spectator area (remembering that by [CONTACT_561]).  
Finalizing the Map 
When the park map has been drawn, you may choose to create a digital copy using common 
software that allows you to use shapes to create or add to images, such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Other, more sophisticated mappi[INVESTIGATOR_525]. A computer generated map 
is not necessary, but may be helpful as it will likely be clearer and easier to read. The images below show three different methods of creating a park map starting with a satellite image of a park.

44 Appendix F: Park user interview recruitment g uide  
 
Park User Sample  
Interview only those over age 18.   No exceptions!  Before conducting an interview, verify the age of 
the person.  You are not permitted to speak to children even if a parent is present!  
If the park is busy during a given shift, try to conduct additional surveys. However, conducting 
additi onal interviews on one day does not reduce the number of interviews required for the next 
day.  
Try to interview people that are representative of the people using the park on any given day. Take into consideration activity level (active/sedentary), gender (men/women), and race.  
Survey Introduction  
When inviting perspective participants to answer the survey, explain that you are working with AltaMed and the RAND Corporation to evaluate how well the parks are serving the local community.  Explain that getting opi[INVESTIGATOR_528].  Tell prospective participants that the questionnaire w ill take only a few minutes of their time, and that the results will be given to the 
Department of Recreation and Parks to help improve local parks.  When requested, give interviewees a flyer, which explains more about the project.                    
Selec ting Participants  
Park users will be selected using a quota design, meaning that you will need to interview a certain number of people according to their characteristics, such as gender and activity level.  
1. In each park, interview [ADDRESS_282] been engaging in some physical activity, 
the remainder will be individuals who are sedentary. In other words, you will interview 5 active males, and 10 sedentary males, 5 active females, and 10 sedentary fem ales.  
3. Participants can be recruited from any target area with people in it.  
a. You may choose to start on any point in the target area (i.e., you do not have to start on the left side). After attempting to recruit the first participant, walk through the target area such that you cover the whole target area without repeating any part of it. For example, start in one corner and move clockwise around the area, or counter -clockwise.  
b. As you walk through the target area, attempt to recruit every other person that yo u 
encounter.  
c. Once you have covered the entire target area as explained above, move to another target area with people in it.  
4. Avoid concentrating on a single age group (e.g., all seniors).  
5. There are no special instructions related to the race/ethnicity of participants. However, note that in some parks you should expect to interview more individuals of certain race/ethnicity groups.  
a. Poinsettia RC and Hoover RC, expect to interview more White participants.  
b. St. Andrews RC, Van Ness RC, Jim Gilliam RC, expect to interview more Black participants. 
c. Alpi[INVESTIGATOR_529], expect to interview more Asian participants.  
d. In all other places, expect to interview a majority of Latino participants.  
 
45 Administration 
On each survey there are two required fields to help track adherence to the quota design: 1) 
Gender, and 2) Activity level. These fields must be completed before proceeding to the rest of the survey questions.  
 
46 Appendix G: Household interview recruitment g uide  
 
Household Sample  
Interviewers will s urvey residents living at designated addresses within one quarter (1/4 mile), one 
half (1/2 mile), and one (1 mile), of the park.  RAND will identify residential addresses within each of 
these three  different distance areas and provide them to Interviewers  by [CONTACT_562].  The goal is to interview members of 10 households in each stratum, or complete 30 
interviews.  
The Interviewer (you) will need to determine if those addresses are appropriate for including in the study.  In some cases, multiple residences may be associated with a single address (e.g. apartment 
buildings) or the address may not be valid (e.g., commercial buildings, vacant lots, condemned home).  You must follow the established protocols to ensure that the interviewing methods meet scientific research criteria.      
Selecting Apartments  
When the provided address is to an apartment building, individual units are determined as follows:  
1. The [ADDRESS_283] apartment to the right.  This protocol should be followed for all oddly numbered subsequent occurrences (3
rd time, 5th time, 7th time, etc.).  [If the apartment 
building is a single story, follow the directions in #2.]  
a. On the Household Interview Log, enter the apartment number next to the printed address AND note that the apartment is on the second floor.  
2. The [ADDRESS_284] 
floor  of the building.  This protocol should be followed for all evenly numbered subsequent 
occurrences (2nd time, 4th time, 6th time, etc.).  
a. On the Household Interview Log, enter apartment number next to the printed 
address AND note that the apartment is on the first floor.  
Selecting Freestanding Units  
When there is more than one freestanding unit at the provided address, determine which unit to 
approach as follows:   
1. The 1st time you encounter this scenario, select the first unit  you approach when walking 
onto the property.  This protocol should be followed for all oddly numbered subsequent 
occurrences (3rd time, 5th time, 7th time, etc.).   
a. On the Household Interview Log, enter the unit number (e.g., Unit A or front house) next to the printed address.   
2. The [ADDRESS_285] the second unit  you approach when 
walking onto the property.  This protocol should be followed for all evenly numbered subsequent occurrences (2
nd time, 4th time, 6th time, etc.).   
a. On the Household Interview Log, enter the unit number (e.g., Unit B or back house) next to the printed address.   
Selecting Alternative Addresses  
It is important that you attempt an interview at each address on the list.  If, however, an address is invalid or a residence is not occupi[INVESTIGATOR_530] (e.g., a condemned building or vacant lot), select an alternative residence as follows:  
 
[ADDRESS_286] a single -family residence  by [CONTACT_563].  [If there is more than one residence at the identified address (e.g., 
apartment), skip to Action #2.]  
a. If the property to the left is a single -family residence, note the replacement address 
under the “Alternative Address” column on the Household Interview Log.  It is also 
necessary to indicate whey the alternative address was selected under the “Reason 
For Alternative Address” column on the log.  
b. If the building to the left is an apartment building or multiple freestanding units follow the protocol outlined in the Selecting Apartments  and Selecting Free -
Standing Units .  Note the replacement address under the “ Replacement a ddress” 
column on the Household Interview Log.  It is also necessary to indicate why an alternative address was selected under the “Reason for replacement ” column on 
the log.        
c. If the re is a vacant lot or commercial building  to the left of the original address, 
continue to search for a residential property as follows:     
i. Continue walking to the left of the original address.  If you come to the end of the street without identifying an appropriate replacement address, return to the original address and follow the same protocol by [CONTACT_564].       
ii. If you come to the end of the street without identifying an appropriate replacement address, return to the original address.  Then f ollow the same 
protocol starting at the address located immediately across the street (first walking right and then left, if necessary).   
• If no residential replacements are identified, note this on the 
Household Interview Log by [CONTACT_565] “no replacement lo cated” under 
the “Replacement a ddress” column.  If, however, a replacement 
address was determined, indicate the address on the log.  It is also 
important to write in the reason for selecting an alternative address on the log.           
2. Replace an apartment by [CONTACT_566][INVESTIGATOR_531].  
This scenario only applies IF the apartment identified when following the protocol outlined in the Selecting Apartments  section yields an unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_532] (no people are curre ntly 
residing in the unit).   
a. If you come to the end of a hallway, return to the original unit and continue 
searching for an occupi[INVESTIGATOR_533].  If there are no occupi[INVESTIGATOR_534], select the next highest fl oor, and so on.  If no 
occupi[INVESTIGATOR_535], note this on the Household Interview Log by [CONTACT_565] “no replacement located” under the “ Replacement a ddress” column.  If a 
replacement address was determined, indicate the unit and floor number on the log.  It is also important to write in the reason for selecting an alternative address on 
the log.        
3. Replace a freestanding unit  by [CONTACT_566][INVESTIGATOR_536], note this on the Household 
Interview Log by [CONTACT_565] “no replacement located” under the “ Replacement a ddress” 
column.  If a replacement address was determined, indicate the unit and floor number on 
the log.  It is also important to write in the reason for selecting an alternative address on the log.        
 
48 Selecting Interview Participants  
When the appropriate residential address has  been identified, knock on the door or ring the 
doorbell.  When the door is answered, immediately explain who you are and why you are there.  
Proceed by [CONTACT_567] 18, currently at home, with the next birthday .  Ask this pe rson to participate in the interview process and notify her/him of the incentive.  
If this person declines, continue asking for participation until some agrees to participate or all people over the age of 18 refuse participation.    
Attempted Interviews  
Mak e a total of four  attempts to interview a person at each selected address.  When returning to an 
address, always approach the same door as your initial attempt (e.g., front door or same apartment number).  If no one answers the door, note the date AND time  (e.g., AM or PM) next to the 
appropriate attempt check box in the “Attempt s” column on the Household Interview Log.   
If a minor answers the door and indicates there is no one over the age of 18 available, indicate the date AND time (e.g., AM or PM) next to the appropriate attempt check box in the “Attempt s” 
column on the Household Interview Log.  In the same space, indicate that a child was home by 
[CONTACT_565] “minor only” above the date and time.         
Conducting Interviews  
For safety, always conduct surve ys in the presence of another Interviewer.  You should never enter a 
residence when talking with survey participants.  Rather, conduct all interviews at the door.  After 
you complete an interview, check the appropriate box in the “Outcome ” column of the Ho usehold 
Interview Log to indicate that the person agreed to participate in the interview, and if it was conducted on the iPad or on a paper form .  Note the date in the “Contact [CONTACT_568]”  column.   
Participants have the right to stop an interview at any time.  If this happens, check  the appropriate 
iPad or Paper box in the “O utcome ” column and write “stopped” above the box that you checked in 
the “Outcome” column. Record the date as usual in the “Contact [CONTACT_568]” column.  
Refusals  
When residents (over age 18) indicate that they are unwilling to participate in the interview, note the refusal on the Household Interview Log by [CONTACT_569] “Refusal” in the “Outcome” column.  The date should be noted under the “Contact [CONTACT_568]”  column.   
When residents decline to participate, D O NOT attempt to conduct another interview at this 
address. Choose a replacement address from the alternatives provided.  
No Contact  
[CONTACT_570] a residence you should circle the appropriate number in the “Attempts” column. If no contac t was made with a resident (at least 18 years of age) after four  
attempts, make sure that each of the numbers is circled, and write “No contact” in the “Contact 
[CONTACT_568]” column.  
Safety Considerations  
If you become concerned about your health and/or safety (e. g., drugs, violence, dogs) while 
attempting to conduct interviews, leave the area immediately.  Make a notation on the Household Interview Log to indicate the situation (e.g., Stopped due to safety).  When possible, select an alternative address as a replacement.

50 Appendix I: Project  summary  (English and Spanish)  
 
                    
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS  
  
Neighborhood Parks  is a project which has the goal is of finding out the best way to help people in 
the City of Los Angeles become more physically active in their local parks.  The Project will begin in 
June, 2013, and we will invite selected park users and local residents like you to participate in an interview on this topic.  We will ask about your park use, your health, and your opi[INVESTIGATOR_537].   
In addition to interviews, members of our Project team will visit your local park on randomly selected days and t imes in order to see how many people are there and how active they are.  
Once we find out what you think about the parks and how often they are being used, we will then create new programs to encourage more people to be active in the park.  These will incl ude free 
classes and a “loyalty” program, where people can earn rewards for visiting the park frequently.  After we launch the programs, we will return to the parks to interview more people and see if the 
programs worked.  
Neighborhood Parks  is a joint effort between The City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and 
Parks, AltaMed (a healthcare service provider) and The RAND Corporation, a private, non -profit 
organization that conducts research and analysis to help

PARQUES DE VECINDARIO  
Parques de vecindario  es un proyecto cuyo objetivo es averiguar la mejor forma de ayudarles a los 
habitantes de la ciudad de Los Ángeles a realizar más actividad física en los parques cercanos a su 
lugar de domicilio. El proyecto comenzará en junio de 2013. Invitaremos a usuarios seleccionados de los parques y a residentes de la zona como usted a participar en una entrevista sobre este tema. Le haremos preguntas sobre el uso del parque, sobre su salud y sobre sus o pi[INVESTIGATOR_539].  
Además de hacer las entrevistas, los miembros del equipo del proyecto visitarán el parque de su localidad a distintas horas en distintos días para ver cuántas personas hay allí y qué tan activas son.  
Cuando averigüemos lo que usted opi[INVESTIGATOR_540] y veamos con qué frecuencia los usa 
la comunidad, crearemos nuevos programas que estimulen a más personas a realizar actividad física allí. Entre ellos se cuentan clases gratuitas y un programa de «usuario leal y frecuente» en el que las 
personas pueden ganar premios por visitar el parque a menudo. Después del lanzamiento de los programas, regresaremos a los parques a entrevistar a más personas y ver si los programas funcionaron.  
Parques de vecindario  es una iniciativa conjunta del Departamento de Recreación y Parques de la 
ciudad de Los Ángeles, AltaMed (una compañía que proporciona atención médica) y RAND Corporation (una organización privada sin fines de lucro que realiza investigaciones y análisis a fin  de 
mejorar las políticas públicas y la toma de decisiones).  
El proyecto cuenta con financiación del Instituto del Corazón, los 
Pulmones y la Sangre (NHLBI, por sus siglas en inglés), que forma parte de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud (NIH).

53 Appendix K: Data and safety m onitoring plan 
 
Promoting Physical Activity in High Poverty Neighborhoods  
(HSPC Study ID: 2011- 0692)   
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
We have created a study DSMB that is external to the project staff to review all protocols and 
interim findings, including questionnaires, recruitment progress, interim data findings, and data quality. The DSMB will be composed of a statistician (Bonnie Ghosh -Dastidar, RAND), an expert in 
physical activity ([CONTACT_592], professor at San Diego State University) and an expert in parks and physical activity ([CONTACT_593], North Carolina State University).  
The DSMB wil l monitor the overall conduct of the RCT and will ensure the overall safety of 
participants by [CONTACT_576] a reasonable doubt. The DSMB will meet at least once per year (or more as needed) 
by [CONTACT_577]. If there are any adverse findings related to park improvements, these will be reported to the DSMB, our community partners (the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Park, AltaMed Health Services), and the RAND HSP C. In addition, the DSMB will evaluate any 
adverse events (along with the HSPC) to protect the safety of study participants and study staff.   
Data Monitoring Plan  
Data Collection and Management  
All data collected will not have any personal identifiers. Randomization is at the park level,  rather 
than the person level.  All datasets will be password -protected .  
Quality control procedures will utilized to ensure that park observations and recruitment is on 
schedule, treatment allocation is occurring as planned, data collection protocols are being used accurately .  
A new quality control measure we would like to introduce is to take a photograph at one park target area during every observation. The photo will be time stamped and delivered with the data to RAND. Once received at RAND it will be deleted from the iPad mini. RAND staff will review the photo to validate the park user counts in that target area. Once it is reviewed by [CONTACT_578], it will be stored in password protected file and will be deleted at the end of the study. It will be coded with the date, park ID number , and park target area.  
Data Storage   
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_579] (field staff) on password protected iPad minis and will 
be uploaded to Accellion . Computer files will be password protected with restricted access to 
project staff. All analytic data files and databases will be maintained on a secure, password -
protected server. iPad  minis will be have a password protected ID known only to team members.  
Data Transfer  
Electronic data will be transferred from the iPad mini to RAND via Accellion .  The data include the 
park observational data as well as the survey data (which do not contain any personal identifiers).  
Elements of Safety Monitoring Plan  
Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
54 For this study, we will define an adverse event (AE) as any untoward physical or mental health 
occurrence that may present itself during the conduct of the study and that may or may not have a causal relationship with the study procedures.  
For the baseline measurement, our greatest concern is the safety of the study staff that will be visiting parks in low income neighborhoods in pairs. They are trained to be careful and never to 
approach any person who appears intoxicated or mentally ill. If they see any illegal activity, such as 
drug deals, they are advised to leave the scene immediately. They are to carry cell phones and wear comfortable shoes.  
We will use the FDA definition of serious adverse event (SAE), which is any adverse experience occurring during the intervention that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse experience, or a persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
Anticipated Adverse Events  
1. Suicidal ideation or intent to harm self  
Field Interviewers will not be probing for this information, since it is not part of the  research task.  
However, if a study respondent spontaneously reports immediate intent to commit suicide, field 
interviews will follow procedures below:  
Emergency  – In the rare instance that a respondent is in imminent danger and needs emergency 
medical or mental health services, the Field Interviewer will insure her own safety and then will dial 
[ADDRESS_287] Coordinator will consult with the RAND HSPC to determine whether further follow -up is 
needed.  
Non -emergency  –If a responde nt spontaneously indicates that he/she is thinking about committing 
suicide (but has no immediate plan), the Field Interviewer will say:  
“You seem to be having a difficult time. If you think this is an emergency, you can call 911 or another local emergency  number such as the Mental Health Crisis Care [give 800 number]. If you think you 
need help with this problem, you can talk to your doctor, your therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/counselor, or call a doctor/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_542].”  
The Field Interviewer will also provide the resp ondent with a written list of mental health referral 
numbers and suggest that he or she discuss feelings with their regular physician or with a mental health specialist obtained through referral.  The Field Interviewer will call the Project Coordinator 
within one hour after the interview. The Field Interviewer will complete an incident report the same 
day.  
The Project Coordinator will send the incident report to the RAND HSPC within [ADDRESS_288] Coordinator will consult with the RAND HSPC to determine whether further follow -up is 
needed.  
2. Severe depression  
 
55 The new survey instrument includes some questions about mental health. If the respondent appears 
to get very upset by [CONTACT_580] (either during or after the interview) and/or spontaneously discloses that they feel very depressed, the Field Interviewer will say:  
“You seem to be having a difficult time. If you think this is an emergency, you can call 911 or another local emergency number such as the Mental Health Crisis Care [give 800 number]. I f you think you 
need help with this problem, you can talk to your doctor, your therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/counselor, or call a doctor/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_542].”  
The Field Interviewer will also provide the respondent with a written list of mental health referral numbers and s uggest that he or she discuss feelings with their regular physician or with a mental 
health specialist obtained through referral. The Field Interviewer will call the Project Coordinator within one hour after the interview. The Field Interviewer will comple te an incident report the same 
day.  
3. Serious injury during physical activity class  
Part of the intervention involves offering additional physical activity classes at select parks. We will be working closely with Park Directors in implementing these classes.   
In addition, all activity instructors will administer verbal consent for participation in exercise classes in the parks, specifying that if potential participants have health concerns, of if they are over [ADDRESS_289] never exercised before, they should talk to their doctor before participating in the classes.  
All Activity Instructors  will be trained on park procedures regarding in how to respond in the event 
that someone is injured or otherwise needs medical attention while participating in class. These include:  
Emergency  – In the rare instance that a respondent is in imminent danger and needs emergency 
medical services, the Activity Instructor will dial [ADDRESS_290] assistance.  The Instructor will also notify the Park Director (or park staff in charge if the Director is not there) and will notify the Proje ct Coordinator and write and submit an incident report the same day.  
The Project Coordinator will send an incident report to the RAND HSPC on the same day.  
The Project Coordinator will consult with the RAND HSPC to determine whether further follow -up is 
needed.  
Non -emergency  – If a respondent is injured or becomes ill, but it is not an emergency, Activity 
Instructors will contact [CONTACT_581] (or park staff in charge if the Director is not there) and will notify the Project Coordinator and write and submit an incident report the same day.  
The Project Coordinator will send the incident report to the RAND HSPC within [ADDRESS_291] Coordinator will consult with the RAND HSPC to determine whether further follow -up is 
needed.  
 
56 Appendix L: Data Log  
Two data logs will be used in each park (or four during reliability data collection periods). The first 
page (Parks Data Log) summarizes data collection to date, while the second (Park User Interview Log) and subsequent pages are used to record daily park  user interviews.  
 
 
57 
 
 
Note that this page is to be duplicated for each day of data collection (i.e., each data collector 
should complete one of these pages for each day of data collection in every park. A single packet can 
be made with one Parks Data Log followed by [CONTACT_582] (possibly more for makeup days).  
 
58 Appendix M: Setting the network IP address  
The instructions below explain how to set the IP addres s for the Rand Wireless network. Only RAND 
staff who have admin rights on the field laptop are permitted to make these changes. The intent is 
to have Rand Wireless be set as a static IP. However, if the laptop is connected to a network other than Rand Wire less, the steps listed below may have to be repeated in order to reestablish the 
network.  
1. Open the Start menu and type cmd in the Search box and press enter.  
   
 
 
 
2. Type ipconfig/all and press enter.  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
3. Scroll down until you see the DNS Servers and note what they are.

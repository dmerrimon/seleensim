Screening Period: After signing the Informed Consent Form 
(ICF), all patients will enter a Screening Period of up to 2 weeks. 
Following confirmation of eligibility criteria, patients will enter the 
following study periods:
Run-in Period: After meeting Screening eligibility criteria, 
patients will enter a 2-week single-blind Run-in Period. On day [ADDRESS_176925] the 
intensity of their DPNP over the previous 24 hours based on 
Question 5 of the BPI-DPN by [CONTACT_77674] “Please rate 
your pain due to your diabetes by [CONTACT_153342].” (0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as 
bad as you can imagine]) in their daily pain diary and will rate the 
interference of pain with sleep by [CONTACT_153343] 9F of the 
BPI-DPN. The ADPS will be calculated using all available daily 
pain diary data. This derived value of the ADPS over Week [ADDRESS_176926] completed 7 of the daily 
pain diary entries during the second week of the Run-in Phase, 
meet criteria for moderate to severe pain, and demonstrate compliance with taking the expected amount of placebo tablets 
during the Run-in Period. During the Run-in Period patients will 
not be allowed use of any rescue medication. On the morning of the 
Run-in Visit, patients may eat a light meal prior to the visit. 
Note:   Patients who fail Screening may be rescreened ONCE after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor. Patients who begin the 
Screening period prior to this amendment and who otherwise would 
qualify for the study may be rescreened again so as to allow them 
to begin the Run-in Phase following implementation of this 
amendment.  
Randomization/Double blind Treatment Period : Patients who 
successfully complete the 2-week single-blind placebo Run-in 
Period and meet all other eligibility criteria  will enter a 6-week 
double-blind Treatment Period.  
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio among the 
following 3 treatment groups:  Group 1: LX9211 100 mg* / 10 mg**, once daily (qd) 
 Group 2: LX9211 200 mg* / 20 mg**, qd  
 Group 3: Placebo, qd   
* Loading dose (Day 1) 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201  
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 6 of 97 
** Maintenance dose (Day 2 – Week 6 Visit) 
Implementation of the treatment randomization schedule will be 
centralized. A 1:1:1 ratio for assigning patients among the treatment 
groups will be accomplished by [CONTACT_153344]. 
On Day 1, patients will receive 1 of 2 dose levels of LX9211 or 
placebo, based on their treatment assignment, to be given as a 
loading dose at the clinic. The loading dose will be followed by a 
daily maintenance dose taken at home on Day 2 through end of 
Week 6. Note:   On days of clinic visits patients will refrain from 
taking their daily dose until after the visit.
Each evening patients will rate and record the intensity of their 
DPNP over the previous 24 hours based on Question 5 of the BPI-
DPN by [CONTACT_77674] “Please rate your pain due to your 
diabetes by [CONTACT_153345].” (0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can 
imagine]), will record the use of rescue medication 
(acetaminophen), and will rate the interference of pain with sleep 
by [CONTACT_153343] 9F of the BPI-DPN. The ADPS will be 
calculated using all available data, however, a minimum of 4 days 
(consecutive or nonconsecutive) from the last week prior to each 
clinic visit is required for the calculation of weekly averages. 
If a patient is unable to tolerate their DPNP, they are encouraged to 
discuss treatment options with the Investigator. At the 
Investigator’s direction, the patient may be permitted to take 
acetaminophen (up to a maximum of 3 grams per day) as a rescue 
medication. If rescue medication does not provide adequate pain 
relief, the patient may discontinue from further participation in the 
study after consultation with the Investigator. Patients who 
discontinue prior to completion of the Week 6 Visit will not be 
replaced.  
Safety Follow-up Period : Following the double-blind Treatment 
Period, all patients will enter a 5-week single-blind Safety Follow-
up Period. During this period patients will dose with [ADDRESS_176927] the intensity of their DPNP over the 
previous 24 hours based on Question 5 of the BPI-DPN by 
[CONTACT_77674] “Please rate your pain due to your diabetes 
by [CONTACT_153346].” (0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]), will 
record the use of rescue medication (acetaminophen), and will rate 
the interference of pain with sleep by [CONTACT_153343] 9F of 
the BPI-DPN.  
 Protocol No. LX9211.201

Blood samples for the determination of plasma LX9211 trough 
levels (C trough) will be drawn predose on Day [ADDRESS_176928] prior to the dosing of study drug on the day of the clinic 
visit. At the Week11 EOT/EW Visit a final sample will be collected. 
During the Screening Visit, patients may choose to participate in 1 
or both of the 2 optional substudies.
The PK substudy will include approximately 30 patients. These 
patients will be confined to a clinical research unit (CRU) twice 
during the study for intensive PK evaluation and biomarker 
evaluation: prior to and following the first dose of study drug and 
prior to and following their final dose of study drug (planned for 
Week 6). 
The second optional substudy is a qualitative patient interview 
following the Week 6 visit (or after early study withdrawal), which 
will include approximately 60 patients. The telephone interview is 
designed to gain insight and understanding of patients’ experiences 
with symptoms of DPNP and to assess relevance and clinical 
meaningfulness of symptom improvements (eg, reduction in pain) 
with LX9211 treatment.
The study design is presented in the diagram below:

significance level of (2-sided Dunnett’s test). Accounting 
for a uniform dropout rate of 20
patients per treatment group) will be enrolled and randomly 
assigned to treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio. This sample size is adjusted 
for the multiple comparisons of each LX9211 treatment group with 
placebo ( Westfall, 1999 ). The sample size can be increased to a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_176933] 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values for all patients 
with non-missing data. Categorical variables will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_153349]. All data will be 
provided in individual patient listings. 
Analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
based on the Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population, defined 
as all randomized patients who had taken at least 1 dose of study 
drug. Safety endpoints analyses will be based on the Safety 
Population, defined as those patients who received any exposure to 
study drug. 
A restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed-effects model 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach will be used to assess the 
difference between LX9211 and placebo for the primary endpoint. 
The MMRM model will include fixed effects of treatment, week, 
treatment-by-week interaction, the randomization factor of Baseline 
pain severity, and Baseline score as covariate. An unstructured 
covariance structure will be used to model the within-patient error. 
The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201  
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 of 97 
denominator degrees of freedom. Other covariance structures will 
be explored should convergence not be met. In the event that a 
rescue medication is used, a supplementary MMRM model will be 
applied on a dataset that excludes data collected after the initiation 
of the rescue medication. To assess the robustness of the MMRM 
analyses performed under the missing at random (MAR) 
assumption, and given the long half-life of LX9211, pattern mixture 
models (PMM) with copy reference-based multiple imputation 
methods will be applied to both datasets (with and without data 
collected after the initiation of the rescue medication). The imputed 
datasets will be combined by [CONTACT_153350]'s rule and analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) model fitted for the 
fixed effects of treatment, the randomization factor of Baseline pain 
severity and the continuous fixed covariate of Baseline score. 
The number and percentage of patients who need rescue medication 
and/or prematurely dropout of the study will be summarized 
descriptively.  
For the continuous, secondary and other efficacy endpoints: BPI-
DPN score and NPSI score, measured at multiple time points, a 
similar modeling strategy used for the primary endpoint will be 
applied. PGIC and the proportion of responders based on Question 
5 of the BPI-DPN, the 11-point scale (0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad 
as you can imagine]) will be compared between treatments using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_153351]. A non-responder imputation (NRI) 
rule will be applied for all analyses based on categorical variables 
to assign outcomes to missing observations.  
The qualitative patient interview substudy will be managed by a 
vendor (RTI-Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC); data 
analysis methods will be detailed in a separate statistical analysis 
plan and will be reported separately.  Pharmacokinetic 
Substudy Assessments The Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population for the PK Substudy patients 
who receive a dose of study drug and who have a predose sample 
and at least the minimum number of samples required to estimate 
the PK parameters.  
For the PK substudy (approximately 30 patients), patients will be 
admitted to the CRU either the day before the first dose (Day -1) or 
prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 1). Blood samples will be 
collected at the following time points:  Day 1: predose (0 hr), and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 
16 hours postdose; 
 Day 2: predose ([ADDRESS_176934] Day 1 dose)

Safety Data Analysis Safety analyses, based on the Safety Population, will involve 
examination of the descriptive statistics and individual patient 
listings for any effects of study treatment on clinical tolerability and 
safety. Summaries will be prepared by [CONTACT_1570] (ie, placebo 
and LX9211 dose level) and, by [CONTACT_153352]. The 
incidence of AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_153353]. All safety data will be provided in 
listings. 
Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) summaries will include 
the overall incidence of TEAEs, Incidence of TEAEs (by [CONTACT_86104] [SOC] and Preferred Term [PT]), TEAEs by [CONTACT_77275], TEAEs by [CONTACT_78487], events leading 
to discontinuation of study drug, deaths, and SAEs. 
Vital signs, ECGs findings, PE findings, clinically significant PE 
findings, weight, and laboratory parameters (chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis) will be summarized descriptively at 
each time point. Actual and change from Baseline data will be 
calculated and summarized. In addition, shift table analyses will be 
presented for the laboratory data.

3. Introduction
3.1 Background on LX9211 and Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system such as 
herpes infection and diabetes, which can lead to chronic pain syndromes such as postherpetic 
neuralgia (PHN) and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) ( Costigan, 2009 ). As a 
consequence of these conditions, patients can experience hyperalgesia (increased pain from a 
normally painful stimulus), allodynia (pain elicited by a stimulus that does not normally evoke 
pain), and spontaneous pain (pain arising without an obvious triggering event). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_153314], a significant unmet need 
remains. Specificall y, these agents do not eliminate neuropathic pain for most patients with fewer 
ction in pain severity ( Finnerup, 2010 ; Snedecor, 2014 ). In 
addition, undesirable side effects, such as dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, cognitive and 
motor impairment, are seen in patients treated with currently available analgesic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
AP2 associated kinase 1 (AAK1) was first identified as a novel therapeutic target for neuropathic 
pain following testing of 3,[ADDRESS_176942], unbiased 
phenotypic screen ( Kostich, 2016 ). AAK1 knockout mice showed markedly reduced persistent 
pain responses (Phase 2 flinching) in the formalin test but were otherwise normal in assays of 
acute pain (hotplate and formalin Phase 1 response) and motor function ( Kostich, 2016 ). AAK1 
knockout mice also failed to develop mechanical allodynia following ligation of the L4 and L5 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_153315] (Chung model) confirming that AAK1 plays an important role in the development 
of persistent and neuropathic pain states  (Kostich, 2016). 
Given this desirable profile Lexicon initiated a discovery program to identify novel, small 
molecule, AAK1 inhibitors with suitable properties to progress into clinical development for the 
treatment of neuropathic pain.  
LX9211 potently inhibits AAK1 with in vitro IC50 values ranging from 1.08 - 3 nM. In vivo 
studies show that acute oral administration of LX9211 reduced established thermal hyperalgesia 
in chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats and reduced established mechanical allodynia in 
streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats. Separate studies confirmed that LX9211 engaged AAK1 in the 
rat spi[INVESTIGATOR_153316]. LX9211 showed low potential for motor impairment in 
rats with no effect observed on performance of the accelerating rotarod test. In the rat 
nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) model, LX9211 increased the current threshold required to 
elicit an A-delta-related increase in the biceps femoris muscle electromyography (EMG) 
response after intravenous (IV) administration. Intravenous administration of LX9211 also 
reduced A-delta-related wind-up of the EMG response and plasma exposures achieved at doses 
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176943], which is a powerful modulator of spi[INVESTIGATOR_153317] ( Fairbanks, 2009 ). 
3.2 LX9211 Nonclinical Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics, and Toxicology
Additional details can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB).
3.2.1 In Vitro Pharmacodynamic Studies
LX9211 was evaluated in a series of in vitro studies to determine potency and selectivity for 
inhibition of human AAK1. LX9211 is a potent inhibitor of AAK1 with in vitro IC 50values 
ranging from 1.08 – [ADDRESS_176944] range of kinase targets. 
LX9211 was also tested for additional pharmacological activity in a panel of 41 assays (39 
targets) to assess modulation of enzymatic, ligand binding or functional activity at selected G-
protein coupled receptors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors and 
enzymes. LX9211 showed modest potency for inhibition of radioligand binding to the 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_29906] (IC 50 projected human maximum free plasma concentration (C maxvalues 16.6 ng/mL corrected for 
cted efficacious clinical dose is 1.28 ng/mL (ie, 
16.6x [1- 50 
concentration of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_153318]. 
3.2.2 In Vivo Pharmacodynamic Studies
In vivo studies conducted to support the development of LX9211 for the treatment of 
neuropathic pain include i) efficacy determinations in 2 neuropathic pain models in rats (CCI and 
STZ models), ii) demonstration of AAK1 target engagement in rat spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], iii) investigation 
of the potential for motor impairment in the rat accelerating rotarod test, and iv) demonstration of 
efficacy in the rat NFR model, which is a translational model sensitive to a variety of established 
pain medications in humans ( Sandrini, 2005 ). Results show that acute oral administration of 
LX9211 reduced established thermal hyperalgesia in CCI rats and reduced established 
mechanical allodynia in STZ-mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively and was associated with average plasma exposures of 18.7 nM 
and 92.3 nM, respectively, on completion of behavioral testing. Separate studies confirmed that 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201

known pharmacology of the compound and was not considered adverse. No effects on the 
cardiovascular system in dogs were clearly attributed to the administration of LX9211 phosphate 
at doses up to 30 mg/kg.
3.2.[ADDRESS_176945] level (NOAEL) for 
LX9211 phosphate was determined to be 10 mg/kg/day after 13 weeks of dosing in the rat and 5 
mg/kg/day after [ADDRESS_176946] battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies. In embryo-fetal development 
studies, the NOAEL for LX9211 phosphate was determined to be 10 mg/kg/day in the rat and 4 
mg/kg/day in the rabbit. 
Additional details can be found in the IB. 
3.2.6 Preclinical GLP-Compliant Toxicology Studies in Rats 
In the 4-week study, LX9211 phosphate was administered by [CONTACT_153354] 0, 3, 15, or 60 mg/kg/day. LX9211-related findings were non-adverse, generally 
reversible, and included infrequent clinical observations of decreased body weight and food 
consumption; minor clinical pathology effects; and vacuolation of macrophages in the lungs and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_153319], the main pancreatic duct, uterine glands, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_153320]. Decreased body weight was associated with a decrease in the 
weight of prostate and atrophy (minimal) and decreased weight and secretions of seminal 
vesicles in male rats at 60 mg/kg/day. Assay results confirm that LX9211 is non-genotoxic. 
Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for LX9211, administered as LX9211 phosphate 
by [CONTACT_27176] 4 weeks to rats, is 60 mg/kg/day. This corresponds to a Week 4 C maxof 3010 
and 4420 ng/mL for males and females, respectively (mean of 3630 ng/mL), and corresponding 
AUC 0-24of 65,000 and 94,900 ng*hr/mL, respectively (mean 79,200 ng*hr/mL). 
In the 13-week rat study, LX9211 phosphate was administered by [CONTACT_153355] 0, 3, 10, or 60 mg/kg/day. At the high dose (60 mg/kg/day), there were 3 
unexplained deaths (2 on Day 11 and 1 on Day 69). In addition, 5 high-dose animals experienced 
a total of 6 short (<1 minute) clonic convulsions; most occurred during the last 3 weeks of 
dosing. No convulsions or deaths occurred at any of the lower doses. LX9211 phosphate-related, 
non-adverse effects included minor clinical observation and clinical pathology findings in 
animals administered 60 mg/kg/day. Adverse decreased body weight changes were noted for 
animals administered 60 mg/kg/day. Non-adverse cytoplasmic vacuolation, consistent with 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 97 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215], was observed in the kidney, lung, thyroid, pancreas, liver, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], and 
uterus of animals administered 60 mg/kg/day and in the lung, uterus, liver, pancreas, and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_153321] 10 mg/kg/day. Adverse microscopic findings were noted in 
the kidneys of animals administered 60 mg/kg/day, characterized by [CONTACT_153356]. Slight atrophy of the prostate 
was noted at 60 mg/kg/day. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for LX9211, 
administered as LX9211 phosphate by [CONTACT_27176] 13 weeks to rats, is 10 mg/kg/day. This 
corresponds to a Week 13 C maxof 922 and 1370 ng/mL for males and females, respectively 
(mean of 1090 ng/mL), and corresponding AUC 0-24of 15,200 and 23,100 ng*hr/mL, respectively 
(mean 19,100 ng*hr/mL). This exposure at the NOAEL is approximately 10-fold higher than that 
projected at the high dose in the current DPN study. 
3.2.7 Preclinical GLP-Compliant Toxicology Studies in Dogs
In the 4-week study, LX9211 phosphate was administered by [CONTACT_153357] 0, 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg/day. LX9211-related pathology findings 
included minimal to mild increases in white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts 
and decreases in absolute lymphocyte and eosinophil counts in some animals at mg/kg/day 
that were considered stress related. Minimal acute inflammation in the urinary bladder was noted 
in 3/6 (2 males and 1 female) animals, with slight urothelial hyperplasia in 2 of these animals, 
and minimal focal ulcer in the urinary bladder in 1 of these animals administered 5 mg/kg/day. 
Minimal aortic mineralization was observed in 1 female animal in the low-dose group and 1 
female animal in the mid-dose group. Minimal to slight aortic mineralization was observed in 2 
female animals in the high-dose group. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for 
LX9211 phosphate, administered by [CONTACT_27176] 4 weeks to dogs, is 2.5 mg/kg/day. This 
corresponds to a Week 4 C maxof 133 and 125 ng/mL for males and females, respectively (mean 
129 ng/mL), and corresponding AUC 0-24 of 1860 and 1090 ng*hr/mL, respectively (mean 1470 
ng*hr/mL).
LX9211 phosphate was also administered by [CONTACT_27176] 13 weeks to male and female beagle 
dogs at a dose of 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg/day. No LX9211 phosphate-related clinical observations, 
ophthalmic findings, physical examination findings, or differences in body weight, body weight 
change, food consumption, heart rate, body temperature, or pulse oximetry occurred. No ECG 
changes were attributed to LX9211 phosphate, and no LX9211 phosphate-related changes in 
hematology or urinalysis (UA) test results were noted. Two minor LX9211 phosphate-related 
clinical pathology findings observed on Day 92 of the dosing phase in male beagles that received 
5 mg/kg/day were minimally increased fibrinogen and globulin concentrations; these findings 
suggested an inflammatory response and lacked microscopic correlates, exhibited evidence of 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 of 97 
reversibility, and were considered not adverse based on their small magnitude. At the terminal 
sacrifice, 1 male receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day LX9211 had minimal muscle degeneration in the 
urinary bladder. At recovery sacrifice, 1 male receiving 5 mg/kg/day also had the same finding. 
The severity in both cases was minimal. This finding occurs as a background finding in beagle 
dogs (Cain et al, 2000). The urinary bladder changes occurred at a low incidence and severity, 
similar to published data indicating no associated clinical signs or evidence of bladder 
dysfunction. The UA data from these animals was unremarkable. The relationship of the urinary 
bladder changes to treatment, if any, is not clear. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL 
for LX9211 phosphate, administered by [CONTACT_27176] 13 weeks to dogs, is 5 mg/kg/day. This 
dose level corresponded to mean C max of 506 and 515 ng/ml for males and females, respectively 
(mean 511 ng/mL), and corresponding AUC0-24 of 6,440 and 6,810 ng*hr/mL for males and 
females, respectively (6,620 ng*hr/mL).
3.2.8 Embryo-Fetal Development Study in Rats 
In the rat embryo-fetal development study, doses of LC9211 phosphate evaluated were 0, 1, 3, 
and 10 mg/kg/day. Test article-related non-adverse effects included decreased mean body weight 
and body weight gain (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day), decreased food consumption (3 and 10 
mg/kg/day), reduced adjusted fetal weight parameters (10 mg/kg/day), and unossified phalanx 
hindlimb skeletal variations (10 mg/kg/day). No test article-related effects on maternal clinical or 
macroscopic observations, reproductive performance, or fetal external, visceral or skeletal 
malformations were noted. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL for LX9211, 
administered as LX9211 phosphate by [CONTACT_153358], is 10 mg/kg/day. On Gestation Day 12 for this dose level, the C maxand AUC0-24 
were 882 ng/mL and 12,000 ng*hr/mL, respectively, for LX9211. 
3.2.9 Embryo-Fetal Development Study in Rabbits
In the rabbit embryo-fetal development study, doses of LX9211 phosphate evaluated were 0, 0.6, 
2, and 4 mg/kg/day. No test article-related effects were noted on maternal body weight, food 
consumption, clinical or macroscopic observations, reproductive performance, cesarean section 
parameters, embryofetal toxicity, or fetal development. Based on the results of this study, the 
NOAEL for LX9211, administered as LX9211 phosphate by [CONTACT_153359], is 4 mg/kg/day. On Gestation Day 13 for this dose level, the 
Cmax and AUC0-24 were 261 ng/mL and 4200 ng*hr/mL, respectively, for LX9211. 
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176947] recently completed: LX9211.1-101-NRM, A Phase 1, Randomized, 
Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Ascending, Single-dose Study to Determine the Safety and 
Tolerability of Orally Administered LX9211 in Healthy Human Participants (SAD); LX9211.1-
102-NRM, A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Ascending Multiple-dose 
Study to Determine the Safety and Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Orally Administered 
LX9211 in Healthy V olunteers (MAD); and LX9211.1-103-NRM, A Phase 1, Open-label, 
Nonrandomized, 2-part Study to Evaluate the Absorption, Metabolism, Excretion, Mass Balance, 
and Absolute Bioavailability of 14C-LX9211, Following Oral and Intravenous (IV) 
Administration in Healthy Male Subjects. A cohort of 6 male subjects were exposed to a single 
oral dose of 14C-LX9211 (nominal 50 mg free drug). Drug-related material in urine and feces 
was recovered for up to 34 days. The mean recovery percentage of drug-related material was  
adverse events (SAEs) and the adverse events (AEs) experienced, were similar to those seen in 
the SAD and MAD studies; all were mild in severity. 
In addition, a separate cohort of 6 subjects underwent an evaluation to establish the absolute oral 
bioavailability of LX9211. A single oral dose of 50 mg was administered, followed by [CONTACT_153360] (14C-9211 50 g). Again, there were no SAEs and the AEs experienced were similar 
to those seen in the SAD and MAD studies; all were mild in severity.  
Both studies included females of nonchildbearing potential and males between the ages of 18 to 
65 years. A total of 146 subjects were enrolled in the 2 studies, 112 of whom were randomized to 
receive LX9211.  
The results from the LX9211-101 study showed that LX9211 was generally well tolerated in 
healthy normal subjects at single doses up to 300 mg. Results from cohorts exposed to single 
dose of LX9211 up to 300 mg are summarized as follows: 
Adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity; there were no severe AEs, deaths, SAEs, or 
withdrawals due to AEs. The most common AEs were dizziness and headache. One subject in the 
300 mg single-dose cohort experienced orthostatic tachycardia with an onset at 1-hour postdose 
and which lasted for 8 days. This event was reported by [CONTACT_153361].  
Systemic exposure to LX9211 (C max, AUC 0-24, AUC 0-96, and AUC 0-inf) increased from 5 to 300 
mg in an apparent dose-proportional manner when examined as the log functions of dose and 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201

exposure. Median T maxof LX9211 was approximately 8-12 hours postdose and the mean t 1/2 
ranged from 143 to 197 hours (6 to 8 days).  
Based on the PK profile of LX9211 in the SAD study, subjects in the MAD study were given a 
loading dose on Day 1, followed by a daily maintenance dose on Days 2-14. This dosage 
regimen permitted steady state to be achieved quickly and then maintained for the duration of the 
study. Results from this study showed that LX9211 was well tolerated in healthy normal subjects 
receiving multiple doses (14 days) up to 200 mg loading dose. All AEs were mild in intensity; 
there were no severe AEs, deaths, or SAEs. One patient discontinued due to reported AEs: 
allergic rash, urticaria, and angioedema. All AEs were assessed as mild and resolved within a few 
days after being treated with a single oral dose of diphenhydramine. Overall, the AEs observed in 
the MAD study were similar to those reported in the SAD study. No clinically significant 
comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), UA findings, or bladder dysfunction-related AEs were 
reported in any subject treated with LX9211 in the SAD or MAD studies with LX9211,  
3.[ADDRESS_176948] tested dose (300 mg). There 
were no deaths, SAEs, discontinuations due to an AE, AEs of severe intensity, or any clinically 
significant laboratory, vital sign, physical exam (PE), or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. 
Multiple-dose administration demonstrated linear PK up to the highest tested dose (200 mg). 
There were no deaths, SAEs, discontinuations due to an AE, AEs of severe intensity, or any 
clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, PE, or ECG findings. 
Based on the observed safety and tolerability data from single doses up to 300 mg and multiple 
doses up to 200 mg for 14 days, the dose levels selected in this study, 100 mg and 200 mg 
loading doses followed by 10 mg and 20 mg maintenance doses, respectively, are expected to be 
well tolerated and represent an adequate range for dose exploration.

3.5 Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups
The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical design allows for unbiased 
comparison of efficacy and safety between 2 different dose levels of LX9211 and placebo. The 
treatment duration (6 weeks) selected for this study was chosen based on the expectation of 
seeing an efficacy signal for the doses of [ADDRESS_176949] size result is used not only to possibly increase the 
sample size, but to provide guidance in early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589]. The option of sample size 
reestimation (SSR) allows the study to maintain statistical power at the original specified value, 
and guard against its reduction due to an unexpected increase in the dropout rate or variability 
associated with the primary endpoint measure.

5. Investigational Plan 
5.1 Overall Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study in patients with DPNP.
Scheduled study visits in the clinic will occur during Screening; at the initiation of the 2-week 
single-blind placebo Run-in Period; on Day 1 (Baseline) and during Weeks 2, 4, and 6 of the 
double-blind Treatment Period, and at Week 11 (Week 5 of the single-blind Safety Follow-up 
Period). 
Male and female patients of nonchildbearing potential, age [ADDRESS_176950] 
1 month prior to Screening and are willing to maintain their doses for the duration of the study. 
Use of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_153322] 2 months prior to 
Screening is not permitted. 
The treatment schema is summarized in Figure 5.1-1 .

5.1.1 Screening Period
After signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF), all patients will enter a Screening Period of up 
to 2 weeks. Following confirmation of eligibility criteria, patients will enter the Run-in Period. 
Note:   Patients who fail Screening may be rescreened ONCE after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor. Patients who begin the Screening Period prior to this amendment and who otherwise 
would qualify for the study may be rescreened again so as to allow them to begin the Run-in 
Phase following implementation of this amendment. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_176951] the intensity of 
their DPNP over the previous 24 hours based on Question 5 of the BPI-DPN by [CONTACT_153362] “Please rate your pain due to your diabetes by [CONTACT_153363].” (0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]) in their 
daily pain diary and will rate the interference of pain with sleep by [CONTACT_153343] 9F of 
the BPI-DPN. The ADPS will be calculated using all available daily pain diary data. In order to 
qualify for randomization, patients must have completed 7 of the daily pain diary entries 
during the week prior to randomization, meet criteria for moderate to severe pain, and 
demonstrate compliance with taking the expected amount of placebo tablets during the 
Run-in Period. During the Run-in Period patients will not be allowed to use any rescue 
medication. On the morning of the Run-in Visit, patients may consume a light meal prior to the 
visit. 
Note :  Patients who fail Screening may be rescreened ONCE after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor. 
5.1.3 Randomization/Treatment Period  
Patients who successfully complete the 2-week single-blind placebo Run-in Period and meet all 
other eligibility criteria  will enter the 6-week double-blind Treatment Period. Patients will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio among the following 3 treatment groups: 
 Group 1: LX9211 100 mg* / 10 mg**, once daily (qd)  
Group 2: LX9211 200 mg* / 20 mg**, qd 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 37 of 97 
 Group 3: Placebo, qd  
* Loading dose (Day 1) 
** Maintenance dose (Day 2 – Week 6 Visit)
Implementation of the treatment randomization schedule will be centralized. A 1:1:1 ratio for 
assigning patients among the treatment groups will be accomplished by [CONTACT_153364].
On Day 1, patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 dose levels of LX9211 or placebo, based on their 
treatment assignment, to be given as a loading dose at the clinic. Patients will remain at the clinic 
for observation for 2 hours following dosing. At 2 hours, orthostatic vital signs will be obtained 
(heart rate and blood pressure) after which time patients may be released.
The loading dose will be followed by a daily maintenance dose taken at home in the morning on 
Day 2 through the Week 6 Visit. Note:   On days of clinic visits patients will refrain from taking 
their daily dose until after the visit. 
Each evening patients will rate and record the intensity of their DPNP over the previous 24 hours 
based on Question 5 of the BPI-DPN by [CONTACT_77674] “Please rate your pain due to 
your diabetes by [CONTACT_153365].” (0 [no 
pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]), record the use of rescue medication 
(acetaminophen), and rate the interference of the patient’s pain with sleep based on Question 9F 
of the DPI-PHN. The ADPS will be calculated using all available data, however, a minimum of 4 
days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) from the last week prior to each clinic visit is required for 
the calculation of weekly averages. 
On the day of randomization and at each clinic visit thereafter, patients will be provided 
individual bottles of study drug. Sufficient quantity of study drug will be provided to allow 
prescribed daily dosing until the next scheduled clinic visit. Each bottle will be labeled with a 1-
panel, double-blind label printed in black. Prior to dispensation, the Investigator/qualified 
designee will complete spaces on the study drug label to specify the Patient Number, Date 
Dispensed, and Investigator Name. In addition, the protocol number, batch number, quantity of 
tablets, route of administration, directions for use, bottle number, and storage conditions will be 
indicated.  
Except on days of clinic visits, patients should be instructed to dose with double-blind study drug 
at approximately the same time each day and before the first meal of the day. One tablet of 
double-blind study drug should be taken with [ADDRESS_176952] dose of study drug prior to the clinic visit will be recorded in the eCRF.
Blood samples for the determination of LX9211 trough levels (C trough) will be collected predose 
on Day 1, and at Weeks 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_176953] prior to the dosing of study drug on the day 
of the visit. At the Week 11 EOT/EW Visit, a final sample will be collected.
On the day of randomization, patients will also receive a bottle of acetaminophen. If a patient is 
unable to tolerate their DPNP, they are encouraged to discuss treatment options with the 
Investigator. At the Investigator's direction, the patient may be permitted to take acetaminophen 
(up to a maximum of 3 grams per day) as a rescue medication. If rescue medication does not 
provide adequate pain relief, the patient may discontinue from further participation in the study 
after consultation with the Investigator.  
Patients discontinuing the study prior to completion of the Week 6 Visit should also complete the 
Safety Follow-up Visit 5 weeks later.
5.1.4 Safety Follow-up Period
Following completion of the 6-week double-blind Treatment Period, all patients will enter the 5-
week single-blind Safety Follow-up Period and take 1 tablet of single-blind study drug each 
morning during this period. 
During the 5-week single-blind Safety Follow-up Period, patients are allowed use of rescue 
medication (acetaminophen) if needed.
5.1.[ADDRESS_176954] substudy will include approximately 30 patients for intensive blood sampling for 
determination of LX9211 plasma concentrations to allow for PK parameter estimation, and 
additional samples for possible biomarker analyses. The PK intensive sampling will occur on 
Days 1 and 2 and at the Week 6 clinic visit. These patients will be confined to a clinical research 
unit (CRU) twice during the study for intensive PK evaluation and biomarker evaluation: prior to 
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176955] dose of study drug and prior to and following their final dose of study 
drug (planned for Week 6).  
The second optional substudy, a qualitative patient interview, will include approximately 60 
patients. The telephone interview will be designed to gain insight and understanding of patients’ 
experiences with symptoms of DPNP and to assess relevance and clinical meaningfulness of 
symptom improvements (eg, reduction in pain) with LX9211 treatment.
6. Study Population

6.3 Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_153313]/Study Withdrawal 
A patient may also be discontinued from the study for the following medical or administrative 
reasons:
 Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_153366], including refusal of the study drug and/or failure to adhere to the study 
requirements as in the study protocol
 Investigator decides that, in the interest of the patient, it is not medically acceptable to 
continue participation in the study
 The Sponsor terminates the study
Note:   If a patient is discontinued from study drug before completing the entire duration of 
the Treatment Period up through Week 6 / EOT/EW, they should be encouraged to complete 
all end-of-study assessments and to agree to report any AEs, including SAEs (see Section 
9.4) for [ADDRESS_176960] the patient (or a 
previously approved designee such as a caregiver, partner, or family member) to determine the 
reason for discontinuation. At minimum, [ADDRESS_176961] to follow-up.  
6.4 Criteria for Termination of the Study 
If the Sponsor, Investigator, study monitor, or regulatory officials discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study center’s 
participation in the study should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate 
consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator. Conditions that may warrant termination of 
the study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in the 
study 
Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176962] 
Failure of the Investigator to enroll patients into the study at an acceptable rate 
Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulations 
Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the Sponsor, study 
monitor, or the FDA 
Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements 
Study termination and follow-up would be performed in compliance with the conditions set forth 
in the following sections of the Code of Federal Regulations: [ADDRESS_176963] been randomized and 
followed to the Week 6 visit, or dropped out earlier, whichever time is sooner. Enrollment will 
not be temporarily halted while data for the interim analysis is being reviewed. Details of the 
futility analysis are given in Section [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol, and in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Charter documents. 
In addition to the planned interim analysis for futility, meetings for an independent DMC data 
reviews will be scheduled to ensure proper safety assessment during enrollment and study 
conduct. Initially, proposed timelines for meeting frequency to review unblinded safety data will 
be as follows: the DMC will meet every 2 months, plus at the time of the planned interim 
analysis should this latter event fall outside the times of the reoccurring meetings. The DMC 
review meetings will occur until database lock or at earlier time deemed suitable by [CONTACT_1363]. 
This meeting schedule may be modified based on the observed patient accrual rates or signals 
seen in the safety data. DMC members will also receive unblinded summaries of serious adverse 
events on a monthly basis to review potential emerging safety trends.

6.6 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment  
Patients will be randomly assigned among 3 parallel treatment groups in a 1:1:1 manner. A 
randomization schedule will be centralized and stratified by [CONTACT_153367]-in period 
based on moderate or severe pain. The randomization schedule will also account for the optional 
PK and biomarkers substudy. The desired balances will be accomplished by [CONTACT_153364]. An Interactive V oice/Web Response System (IXRS) will be used 
as a central mechanism to assign patients to study treatment. 
6.[ADDRESS_176964] of the study will remain blinded to individual patients’ 
treatment assignments until database lock. 
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a patient is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. If the unblinding occurs without the 
knowledge of the Sponsor and/or designee, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or 
designee as soon as possible and no later than [ADDRESS_176965] be clearly documented in the source records.  
The Sponsor’s designee performing IXRS will not release the randomization schedule to any 
party except upon formal written request by [CONTACT_153368]. The request must be 
approved by [CONTACT_7251], according to the Sponsor’s standard operating 
procedures (SOPs). Details of any disclosure of the randomization schedule will be recorded in 
the site’s study files and the electronic Trial Master File (eTMF). A copy of the randomization 
schedule will also be sent to the Sponsor and/or designee. The blinding of the study will be 
broken after the database has been locked. To maintain continuous blinding and study integrity, 
analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_55467], and measures will be taken to ensure 
the validity of the data.

7.5 Dose Adjustment
Dose ad
justments of any study drug are not permitted or applicable during the stud y. For safety 
reasons, should an unacceptable risk related to study drug arise, patients may be discontinued 
from the study. In the case of tolerability issues, the investigator can consider a temporary dose 
interruption of no less than 3 days, but no more than 5 days. If  adverse event continues once 
study drug has been reinitiated then patient’s continued participation needs to be assessed.  
8. Study Procedures
A schedule of study assessments with detailed time points is provided in Appendix A .
8.1 Description of Study Assessments
8.1.1 Clinical Laboratory Assessment 
Clinical laboratory assessments will include, at a minimum, blood chemistry (albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine transaminase [A LT], amylase, aspartate transaminase [AST], total bilirubin, 
glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], calcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, creatinine, magnesium, 
phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total protein, and uric acid), lipid panel (high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine phosphokinase 
[CPK]), hematology (complete blood count [CBC] with differential, and platelet counts), and 
urinalysis (including appearance, color, glucose, ketones, nitrite, pH, protein, specific gravit y, 
occult blood, leukocyte esterase, bilirubin, and urobilinogen). Urine microscopy will only be 
performed if any of the following are present in the urine sample: occult blood, leukocyte 
esterase, protein, or nitrite. The microscopy will include analysis for the presence of WBC, red 
blood cells, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], bacteria, casts, and crystals. 
Additional assessments such as: pregnancy tests [females only]), and a urine screen (drugs of 
abuse and THC) will be done at time points specified in Appendix A. 
The incidence of clinically significant laboratory values, as well as clinically significant shifts in 
laboratory values, should be reported as an AE ( Section 9.1.1 ) and followed as described in 
Section 9.5 ; retests should be performed as frequently as clinically indicated. 
8.1.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Blood samples for the determination of plasma LX9211 trough levels (C trough) will be drawn 
predose on Day [ADDRESS_176970] prior to the dosing of study drug on the day of 
the clinic visit. At the Week 11 visit a final sample will be collected.  
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 of 97 
The PK substudy will include approximately 30 patients. These patients will be confined to a 
clinical research unit (CRU) twice during the study for intensive PK evaluation and biomarker 
evaluation: prior to and following the first dose of study drug and prior to and following their 
final dose of study drug (planned for Week 6). Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed at 
time points indicated in the schedule of events ( Appendix B ).
Plasma samples will be analyzed by a central bioanalytical laboratory (Covance Laboratories 
Inc., Madison, WI) under a separate protocol. Detailed procedures for the drawing, preparation, 
storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_153332]. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_176971] to follow-
up. In case a patient reports an AE, study drug may be held for up to 3 days to assess resolution, 
rather than discontinuing patient permanently from study participation. If the AE improves or 
resolves, study drug may be resumed. Prior to discontinuing a patient permanently from study 
participation, the Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Sign Measurements 
Measurement of vital signs will include assessment of blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse rate, 
and temperature as specified in Appendix A . Vital sign measurements should not be conducted 
within the [ADDRESS_176972] orthostatic BP and HR measured 2 hours after administration of 
loading dose while in the clinic. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examinations, Height, and Weight 
Complete physical examinations will be performed as outlined in Appendix A. A complete 
physical examination will include, at minimum, a review of the patient’s general appearance, 
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, back and extremities, skin, and 
general neurological system.  
Protocol No. LX9211.201 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 of 97 
A symptom-related brief physical exam will only occur if the patient is experiencing symptoms 
or AEs. If a symptom-related brief physical exam is required, it should include a review of all 
body systems that relate to the symptoms and/or AE the patient is experiencing. 
Height and weight (without shoes) will be measured as outlined in Appendix A . Patients may 
consume a light meal prior to the visit. All weights can be taken prior to or after the patient’s first 
meal of the da y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms
Electrocardiograms (ie, 12-lead ECGs) will be performed as specified in Appendix A.
8.1.4 Patient Reported Outcomes 
Three patient-reported outcomes (PROs), BPI-DPN, PGIC, and NPSI, measures will be assessed 
on a validated electronic device completed at the time of the clinic visit as specified in Appendix  
A.  
The BPI-DPN, is a 9-item questionnaire assesses the severity of pain and its impact on 
functioning in patients with DPN. The full questionnaire will be completed at Visit 3 
(Baseline) and at Visit 4, 5, 6, and 7. Question 5 (average pain of prior 24 hours) and 
Question 9 F (interference of pain with sleep) will be completed daily from Run-in 
through the end of the Safety Follow-up Period.  
The PGIC, a 7-point rating scale will assess patient's belief about the overall 
improvement experienced by [CONTACT_153372] 6. 
The NPSI, a 12-item questionnaire, assesses the different components of neuropathic pain 
syndromes (ie, spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain, evoked pain, 
paresthesia/dysesthesia). Ten items related to different pain descriptors (eg, burning, 
squeezing, electric-shock, stabbing, tingling) allows assessment of the different 
dimensions of neuropathic pain and 2 items on frequency and duration of pain. This will 
be completed at Visit 3 (Baseline), and at Visits 6 and 7. 
8.1.5 Qualitative Patient Interview
A telephone qualitative patient interview substudy will be conducted for approximately 60 
patients within 2 weeks following the Week 6 Visit or following premature withdrawal.  
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 of 97 
The purpose of the phone interview will be to gain insight and understanding of patients’ 
experiences with symptoms of DPNP and to assess relevance and clinical meaningfulness of 
symptom improvements. (eg, reduction in pain). 
The qualitative patient interview will be performed as specified in Appendix A .
9. Safety Reporting
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs and special situations that occur 
during the study.
Adverse events will be collected at all study visits as outlined in the Schedule of Study 
Assessments. Each AE should be recorded using the medical diagnosis; if a diagnosis is not 
established at the time of the reporting, a symptom or sign in standard medical terminology 
should be used. 
Adverse events should not be solicited with leading questions that suggest specific signs or 
symptoms. Rather, AEs should be solicited by [CONTACT_99020] a non-leading question such as: 
“Do you feel different in any way since receiving the dose or since the last assessment?” 
Adverse events that occur after the signing of the informed consent and before the first dose of 
study drug should be recorded as medical history unless the event is a serious adverse event 
(SAE) that could be associated with the trial procedures and, which could modify the conduct of 
the trial, or otherwise specified.
9.[ADDRESS_176973] dose of double-blind study drug. 
An AE includes any noxious, pathological, or unintended change in anatomical, physiological, or 
metabolic functions as indicated by [CONTACT_153373] a patient has 
provided informed consent, whether or not considered related to the study medication.  
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 54 of 97 
This definition includes an exacerbation of preexisting medical conditions or events, historical 
conditions not present prior to study treatment, which reappear following study treatment, 
intercurrent illnesses, hypersensitivity reactions, drug-drug or drug-food interactions, medication 
errors, overdose (both intentional or unintentional), drug misuse/abuse, false positive laboratory 
test, or the significant worsening of the disease under investigation. 
Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting conditions that do not represent a clinically 
significant exacerbation or worsening need not be reported as AEs.
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as any AEs reported after the first dose of double-blind 
study medication on study Day 1. 
Any treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory result should be reported as an AE if it meets 1 or 
more of the following conditions: 
 Fulfills any of the criteria for an SAE ( Section 9.1.2 ), 
 Results in discontinuation of study treatment,
 Requires treatment,  
 Is considered by [CONTACT_16426].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Special considerations for bladder dysfunction-related adverse events 
In studies with LX9211 in dogs, changes to the urinary bladder (including minimal 
inflammation, slight urothelial hyperplasia, minimal focal ulceration, and minimal muscle 
degeneration) were noted. The doses used in these animal studies were much higher than what 
will be used in this Phase 2. In the Phase [ADDRESS_176974] dose of study drug. 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 of 97 
An SAE is defined as any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death;
 A life-threatening AE - defined as an event, in the view of the Investigator, the occurrence 
of which places the patient or patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an 
AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death;
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153333]; 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; or,
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug
abuse.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153334] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This does not include an 
emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153335]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153336], or for administrative/social reasons (such as convenience, 
logistics) should not be reported as SAEs. However, if an elective procedure has to be performed 
sooner than planned due to a worsening of the underlying medical condition and the patient is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153337], the worsening medical condition should be reported as an SAE. 
Any laboratory abnormality fulfilling any of the criteria for an SAE should be reported as such. 
9.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An unexpected AE is an AE that is not listed in the Reference Safety Information (eg, the IB) or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected” also refers to the 
AEs that are mentioned in the Reference Safety Information as occurring with the class of study 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 of 97 
medication or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the study medication, but are 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study medication. 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) 
if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents.
It the responsibility of the Sponsor to assess whether an AE is expected or unexpected.
9.[ADDRESS_176975] to the severity and relationship to study drug. 
9.2.1 Severity 
The Investigator will assess the severity of each AE using their clinical expertise and judgment 
using 1 of the following 3 severity grades:   Mild : event is transient and easily tolerated, and requires no or minimal treatment
 Moderate : event causes limited interference with usual daily activity and requires simple 
therapeutic intervention
 Severe : event causes marked interference with usual daily activities and requires 
systemic drug therapy or other therapeutic intervention
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented as separate AEs to allow an assessment 
of the duration of the event at each level of severity.
9.2.2 Causality
Causality assessment is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
medication caused an AE. Factors that should be considered in causality assessment include, but 
are not limited to, temporal relationship, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or 
lack of association) with underlying disease or concomitant medication, biological plausibility, 
and previous observation or lack of with the study medication or other medication(s) in the same 
class as the study medication. 
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176976] appropriate 
description as follows:
Not related : The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship to administration 
of the study medication, or an alternative etiology (eg, underlying disease, complications, 
concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment) is much more likely
Unlikely related : The AE has an improbable temporal relationship to administration of 
the study medication, or an alternative etiology (eg, underlying disease, complications, 
concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment) is more likely  
Possibly related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal relationship to administration of 
the study medication (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), and an 
alternative etiology (eg, underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or 
concurrent treatment) is equally or less likely
 Probably related : The AE follows a reasonable temporal relationship to administration 
of the study drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), and an alternative 
explanation (eg, underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent 
treatment) is unlikely
 Definitely related : The AE follows a plausible temporal relationship to administration of 
the study medication (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) and alternative 
etiology (eg, underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent 
treatment) can be ruled out. Positive rechallenge (ie, reappearance or worsening of the 
AE after the study drug is reintroduced) or a response pattern known to be associated 
with administration of the study drug provides further evidence of a definitive causality 
assessment.
9.3 Special Situations
Unless otherwise defined, events described below should be reported in the manner and 
timeframe as SAEs ( Section 9.4 )

outcome through delivery or termination of the pregnancy. In pregnancies that progress to term, 
the infants should be followed till 6 months after birth and any congenital abnormalities/birth 
defects in the infants should be reported as an SAE.  
The outcome of a pregnancy, and the presence or absence of a congenital abnormality should be

10.4.2  Analyses of efficacy endpoints
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT Population as defined in Section 10.2.2 . 
Supportive analyses will be performed on the PP Population.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint
The primary endpoint is the change from Baseline to Week 6 in ADPS. The primary analysis 
will be based on observed data including data measured after the initiation of the rescue 
medications. 
A restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) 
approach will be used to assess the difference between LX9211 and placebo in the primary 
endpoint (ie, change from Baseline to Week 6 in the ADPS derived from data collected daily 
from Question 5 of the BPI-DPN instrument). The MMRM model will include fixed effects of 
treatment, week, treatment-by-week interaction, the randomization stratum of Baseline pain 
severity, and the Baseline score as covariate. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within-patient error. The Kenward-Roger approximation will be used to estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. Other covariance structures will be explored should 
convergence not be met. In the event that a rescue medication is used, a supplementary MMRM 
model will be applied to a dataset that excludes data collected after the initiation of the rescue 
medication. To assess the robustness of the MMRM analyses performed under the missing at 
random (MAR) assumption, and given the long half-life of LX9211, pattern mixture models 
(PMM) with copy reference-based imputation methods will be applied to both datasets (with and 
without data collected after the initiation of the rescue medication). The imputed datasets will be 
combined by [CONTACT_153350]'s rule and analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) model 
fitted for the fixed effects of treatment, the randomization stratum of Baseline pain severity, and 
the continuous fixed covariate of Baseline score.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of secondary and other efficacy endpoints 
Continuous secondary and other efficacy endpoints: BPI-DPN scores and NPSI, measured at 
multiple time points, will be analyzed using a similar modeling strategy as used for the primary 
endpoint.  
Categorical secondary endpoints: PGIC, Proportion of responders based on Question [ADDRESS_176983] 
stratified by [CONTACT_153376]. Patients with missing 
measurement at Week 6 will be considered non-responders. A nonresponder imputation (NRI) 
rule will be applied for all analyses based on categorical variables to assign outcomes to missing 
observations. The percentage of patients who need rescue medication and prematurely dropout 
 Protocol No. LX9211.201 
 
09 September 2021 CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 of 97 
will be summarized descriptively. The Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to generate statistical 
summaries of the time to loss of efficacy variable among patients who achieve reduction 
in ADPS based on Question 5 of the BPI-DPN from Week 6 and Week 11. 
The qualitative patient interview substudy will be managed by a vendor (RTI-Health Solutions, 
Research Triangle Park, NC). The data analysis methods will be detailed in a separate statistical 
analysis plan and results will be reported separately. 
Multiplicity
The 2 pairwise comparisons of each LX9211 dose levels vs placebo will be performed using 
Dunnett’s test. Testing among the secondary endpoints will not be adjusted for multiplicity, and 
hence, the analyses will be exploratory. Other endpoints will likewise not be adjusted for 
multiple testing. Adjusted and unadjusted p-values will be presented. 
10.4.3  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analyses 
If quantifiable plasma concentrations are available, PK parameters will be derived using non-
compartmental techniques, and their summarization will be based on descriptive and graphical 
methods and summarized for each dose level. 
Plasma concentrations and time deviation data will be presented in the data listings by [CONTACT_3148], 
patient, and nominal time point. Plasma concentration data will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_153377]. Individual and mean plasma concentration versus nominal time 
profiles will be displayed graphically. All PK data will be presented in the data listings. 
After the first 10 PK substudy patients complete the study, a blinded PK analysis may be done to 
confirm exposure following oral tablet administration.  
10.4.4  Subgroup Analyses 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_153378]:  Baseline pain severity moderate or severe

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events verbatim descriptions (Investigator terms from the eCRF) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities MedDRA, Version 22.1 .
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as events that first occur or worsen after 
the first dose (Day 1). Treatment-related adverse events are defined as events that are indicated 
on the CRF by [CONTACT_153379].
Incidence of TEAEs will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_153380], by [CONTACT_153381]. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
summaries will include the overall incidence of TEAEs, Incidence of TEAEs (by [CONTACT_12360] [SOC] and Preferred Term [PT]), TEAEs by [CONTACT_11196] (mild, moderate, or 
severe), TEAEs by [CONTACT_78487] (related, or unrelated). In addition, events 
leading to discontinuation of study drug, deaths, and SAEs will also be summarized and/or listed 
by [CONTACT_4676]. If a patient reports the occurrence of a particular event more than once, the most 
severe of that event will be counted in the summary of the TEAEs, and the greatest degree of 
relationship to treatment will be included in the summary of treatment-related events. Patients 
will be counted only once within a SOC and PT, even if the patient experienced more than 1 
TEAE within a specific SOC or PT. A by-patient data listing of all AEs will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Deaths, Serious and Other Significant Adverse Events 
Listings of all deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation from study treatment will be

Laboratory results will be reported in Conventional units and Systeme International (SI). Clinical 
laboratory value observed at Baseline (predose), at each time point, and changes from Baseline 
to each assessment time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented by 
[CONTACT_1570]. Additionally, each patient’s laboratory results will also be classified into Low, 
Normal, and High according to standard normal ranges and summarized using shift tables, 
comparing the Baseline and each assessment time point. Percentages will be based on the 
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176985] results will be provided. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs 
Vital signs values, and changes from Baseline to each time point will be summarized using

Physical examination findings will be listed for each patient. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
The actual values of the 12-lead ECG parameters at Baseline, at each time point, and change 
from Baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The number and percentage of 
patients with at least [ADDRESS_176986] Baseline abnormal ECG result will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics and presented by [CONTACT_1570].

respectively.  Application of the futility analysis is to serve as a guideline and is not the only 
source of information used to evaluate the trial for a negative finding. Assessment of other data 
available at the interim analysis will be used to qualify the trial for a recommendation of futility 
(eg, secondary and other efficacy variables , safety data).

A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or Study 
Manual requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the patient, the
Investigator, or the study site staff. 
Significant deviations (ie, those categorized as critical or major) will be provided as listings in 
the final report.
11. Study Management 
The Investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate eCRFs and 
source documentation. Source documentation constitutes original records, which may include: 
progress notes, medication administration records, laboratory reports, ECG tracings, discharge 
summaries, etc.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator and site staff to use continuous vigilance to identify and 
report deviations. In addition to notifying the Sponsor, protocol deviations are to be reported to 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as per applicable guidelines. The Investigator and site study 
staff are responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements.  
All data and corrections, if applicable, entered on to the eCRF must meet minimum requirements 
as specified in the case report form guidelines. All eCRFs should be completed in their entirety 
and stored in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. The Investigator must sign the Investigator’s 
statement in each patient’s eCRF indicating that the data reported are accurate.
against source documentation. Computer programmed edit checks will be run against the 
database to check for discrepancies and reasonableness of the data, and the safety database will 
be reconciled with the clinical database. All issues resulting from the computer-generated checks 
and the safety database reconciliation will be resolved according to standard data management 
practices in conjunction with the Sponsor, clinical study personnel, and the study Investigators.
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176988] to ethics, 
protocol adherence, site procedures, integrity of the data, and applicable laws and/or regulations. 
At regular intervals during the study and following completion of the study, the Sponsor’s study 
monitors will contact [CONTACT_137599], telephone calls, and/or letters in order to 
review study progress, eCRF completion, and address any concerns or questions regarding the 
study conduct. During monitoring visits, the following aspects of study conduct will be carefully 
reviewed: informed consent of patients, patient recruitment, patient compliance with the study 
procedures, source data verification, drug accountability, use of concomitant therapy by [CONTACT_1962], 
AE and SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. Records pertaining to these 
aspects are expected to be kept current.
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the clinical monitor, to other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor, and to regulatory inspectors
11.[ADDRESS_176989] (IRB) as per applicable guidelines. The Investigator and site 
study staff are responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements.

proper follow-up and remediation, as required.
In the case of certain deviations, including those that are deemed to be Critical or Major, 
corrective actions may need to be developed by [CONTACT_779] (with the input of the Sponsor/CRO), and 
implemented promptly. Prospective requests to deviate from the protocol (ie, waivers) will not be 
approved unless the approval is required to protect the health or welfare of the patients enrolled 
in the study. 
 Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_176990] of 1996 and Subsequent 
Updates 
The Investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations relating to the privacy of patient health information, including, but not limited to, the 
Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 (the 
Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act of 1996 [HIPAA] Privacy Regulation and any 
applicable updates). The Investigator shall ensure that study patients authorize the use and 
disclosure of protected health information in accordance with HIPAA Privacy Regulation and in 
a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
The Department of Health and Human Services updated a final rule to modify HIPAA. The new 
rule has been in effect since 26 Mar 2013, and strengthens the privacy and security protection for individual’s health information; modify the rule for Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected

files and made available to FDA representatives upon request. If, for any reason, subject risk 
is increased as the study progresses, a revised, IRB-approved consent form must be signed by 
[CONTACT_423]. Before the study begins, a sample of the consent form must be provided to the 
Sponsor for review. The FDA may reject otherwise scientifically valid studies if proper 
informed consent has not been obtained from all subjects. 
Only in the case of a life-threatening incident may an investigational product be used without 
prior signed consent. In such an emergency situation, separate certifications must be written 
both by a physician not participating in the study and by [CONTACT_737]. The certifications, 
along with the protocol and informed consent, must be sent to the IRB within [ADDRESS_176996] be allowed adequate time to 
consider the potential risks and benefits associated with their participation in the study. 
In situations where the patient is not legally competent to provide consent (ie, mentally 
incapacitated), written consent must be obtained from a parent, legal guardian, or legal 
representative. In these situations, the consent must be signed and dated by a witness. 
The informed consent document must have been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_153391]’s IRB prior to the initiation of the study. The document must contain the [ADDRESS_176997] include the following 8 elements:  A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purpose of the research

Rationale for Amendment 
Protocol Amendment 2.0.1 includes a number of modifications to properly outline the PK, whole 
blood for possible biomarker/target engagement, and cytokine/chemokine sample collection. Of 
note, this protocol amendment reduces the number of total samples and total volume of blood to 
be collected from a patient during their participation in the PK substudy. Additionally, the patient 
is given the option to potentially reduce the number of days they are to stay at the sites Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU). This amendment only applies to sites participating in the PK substudy for 
LX9211.201. The following is a summary of the major changes and the rationale for them. 
Attached is a detailed summary of each change included in this Amendment.  
 Provided patients participating in PK substudy the opportunity to reduce their duration of 
stay giving them the option to be admitted to the CRU either the day before the first dose 
(Day -1) or prior to the first dose of study drug (Day 1). In the same manner, patients can be 
admitted to the CRU either the day before their Week 6 or EOT/EW visit or prior to 
administration of study drug (LX9211) dose the day of their Week 6 or EOT/EW visit. 
 Modified required PK sample collection time points in the Treatment Schema to align with 
Appendices A and C 
 Removed collection of samples for PK time points: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24 hours 
postdose for Day 2 and Day 3 predose as samples will not provide added scientific benefit to 
the study 
 Appendix B: revised table to included option for predose check-in to CRU on Day 1

Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_177004] 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 2 of 27
Rationale for Amendment
Protocol Amendment 2 includes a number of modifications to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
endpoints, prior and concomitant medications, corrects a number of inconsistencies, and includes 
a number of administrative changes. The following is a summary of the major changes and the
rationale for them. Attached is a detailed summary of each change included in this Amendment is 
attached.The name [CONTACT_153400].
The Introduction was updated to include results of Segment 2 reproductive toxicology 
studies, which support inclusion of women of childbearing potential in the study 
provided they are using adequate contraception.
The primary endpoint was modified to be based on the average pain experienced by 
[CONTACT_153397] 24 hours as measured by [CONTACT_7854]-Diabetic 
Peripheral Neuropathy (BPI-DPN) scale, question 5, rather than the Numerical Rating 
Scale (NRS scale), which was a single item scale that collected the worst pain level 
over the prior 24 hours. This also changed the basis upon which the Average Daily 
Pain Score (ADPS) was defined from the NRS to the BPI-DPN. Many other 
endpoints, which had been based on the worst pain measure in the NRS scale, were 
also modified to reflect the new measure based on the BPI-DPN. This was done to 
reduce the amount of variability expected in the scores and provide a better measure 
of overall potential impact the drug on pain levels.Clarified secondary outcome measure to specify that change from Baseline to Week 6 
in interference of pain with sleep and other aspects of patients life would be assessed 
based on the BPI-DPN, rather than stating the analysis would be of “severity and pain 
interference based on the BPI-DPN”. Specified that Question 9F of the BPI-DPN 
would be administered daily to assess interference of pain with sleep. Allowed patients to be removed from Screening and then rescreened in order to begin 
the Run-in Phase under the revised protocol. This is necessary to ensure that the 
primary question being asked daily is consistent in the Run-in and randomized 
treatment period, and that patients are provided the same scales during the Run-in and 
Randomized treatment periods.
Clarified that Baseline ADPS would be based on the average scores during the second 
week of the Run-in Phase (previous protocol version implied that it was a single day 
score – day before randomization)
Modified required compliance with diary completion to qualify for randomization 
during the Run-in Phase from 80% (no more than 1 missed entry per week) to 70% 
(allowing up to 2 missed entries per week) to facilitate patient enrollment.
Protocol No. LX9211.[ADDRESS_177005] 2020 CONFIDENTIAL Page 3 of 27
Removed the exclusion criteria for high or low variability in pain scores during the 
Run-in Phase based on rereview of references and assessment that there are no data to 
support the benefit of this exclusion in patients with DPNP.
Allowed inclusion of women of childbearing potential using adequate contraception 
based on new toxicology data.
Removed upper age limit for entry to allow elderly patients greater than 75 years to 
enroll. 
Removed exclusion criterion that prevented enrollment of patients who had greater 
than 1% change in A1C value over prior [ADDRESS_177006] pain and response to study drug.
Increased allowable A1C value at randomization to 10.5% to improve patient 
recruitment. 
Revised and clarified allowed medications for DPNP prior to, and during the study 
(opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], NSAIDs, over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements, 
cannabinoids), and vaccinations prior to the study in order to better accommodate 
patient needs.
Clarified that biomarker assay was to be performed only in patients participating in 
intensive PK sampling substudy in order to ensure that samples could be collected, 
processed, and shipped under required conditions.
Added to the text that Interview Substudy would be performed in patients who 
completed the study or who discontinued treatment prematurely. In the prior version, 
this was only stated in the Schedule of Events in the Appendix.
Specified that time to loss of efficacy measure was to be analyzed among patients 
who achieved a 30% reduction in pain from Baseline in order to ensure a meaningful 
analysis.
Clarified that no adjustment for pair-wise comparisons would be applied to the 
secondary outcome measures, and hence these analyses would be considered 
exploratory.
Included analysis of percent change in the primary outcome measure from Baseline to 
Week 6 and from Week 6 to Week 11 using cumulative distribution functions.
Updated the Treatment Schema in the text and the Schedules of Events in the 
Appendices to be consistent with the design changes and administrative changes in 
the protocol.

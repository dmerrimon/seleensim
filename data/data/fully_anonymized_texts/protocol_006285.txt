Primary Endpoint  
• Determine the effect of CLEAR therapy versus placebo on the change in  percent  predicted absolute 
forced vital capacity (FVC) in participants with pulmonary sarcoidosis , comparing baseline with 
performance after completion of 16 weeks of therapy.  
 
Sample Size:   
A maximum of 128  participants will be randomized  into one of two arms: CLEAR therapy or Placebo.  
We need a sample size of [ADDRESS_498683] 90% power to detect a 5% difference 
(5% in CLEAR vs 0% in placebo) in change of FVC  percent  predicted from baseline.    To factor in a 20% 
drop-out rate, we plan to enroll 64 participant s per arm.    
        
Safety Monitoring:  
The DSMB will receive a safety analysis once [ADDRESS_498684] completed the study. Interim analysis will be pr ovided  to the 
DSMB by [CONTACT_396456]/her designee . The safety monitoring plan is described 
fully in the Safety Monitoring section of the protocol.

Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Trial  (CLEAR II)  
Vers ion 10.[ADDRESS_498685] reported molecular and immunologic 
evidence supporting a significant association between mycobacteria and sarcoidosis.   
 
Previously , we reported evidence of mycobacterial 16S rRNA or RNA polymerase B in 60% of the 
sarcoidosis granulomas and i n none of the controls (p<0.[ZIP_CODE], chi square) 2.  Sequence analysis of the 16S 
rRNA and rpoB amplicons revealed the presence of a novel Mycobacterium , genetically most similar to M. 
tuberculosis  complex  (MTB) (99% positional identity).  Song et al noted IgG antibodies to recombinant MTB 
katG in sera fr om 48% of sarcoidosis patients compared to 0% in sera from [COMPANY_003] negative controls 
(p=0.0059).  Using matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, they found 
MTB katG peptides in 75% of sarcoidosis specimens compared to 14% o f control specimens (p=0.0006); in 
situ hybridization localized MTB katG and 16S rRNA DNA to the inside the sarcoidosis granuloma [3].   
Analysis of Polish sarcoidosis lymph nodes revealed MTB complex heat shock  protein (hsp) 70, hsp65, and 
hsp16 3.  We were the first to report Th -1 immune responses to mycobacterial virulence factors, ESAT -6, 
katG, Ag85A, and superoxide dismutase A (sodA) in sarcoidosis peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 4-7. Most recently an independent group detected Th -[ADDRESS_498686] a role for mycobacteria, it is unclear 
whether this is a response to poorly degraded antige n, as is seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or persistent, 
viable Mycobacterium species.  Three clinical observations support that sarcoidosis is due to an active 
Mycobacterium :  1) Transplantation of human sarcoidosis organs leads to disease transmissi on between donor 
and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] 11, 12; 2) cellular immune responses against mycobacterial virulence factors are detected in 
sarcoidosis diagnostic BAL at presentation and are quantitatively similar to those seen in patients with active 
mycobacterial infection 13;  3) the immune responses detected thus far are directed against microbial antigens 
that are secreted during active mycobacterial replicatio n 14-16.  
 
1.2  Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of CLEAR therapy for sarcoidosis patients with 
progressively worsening symptoms .  Given that the morbidity and mortality has proven to be significant 
in patients with sarcoidosis, we believe there is real opportunity for improved clinical outcomes if the 
right interventional agent can be identified.  In choosing change in absolve FVC  as the primary outcome;

Study Title:  Investigation of the Efficacy of Antimycobacterial Therapy on Pulmonary Sarcoidosis Phase II Randomized, 
Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Trial  (CLEAR II)  
Vers ion 10.[ADDRESS_498687] recently mycobacterial 
RNA in sarcoidosis biopsies was detected, and viable mycobacteria were visualized within a sarcoidosis 
clinical specimen using reporter mycobacteriophages.  In known mycobacterial infections, antibiotic regimens 
such as macrolid es (clarithromycin or azithromycin), rifamycins, ethambutol are used17.  Macrolides and 
rifampin  inhibit protein synthesis by [CONTACT_396457]; 
ethambutol inhibits mycobacterial cell wall formation by [CONTACT_396458], and quinolones 
inhibit DNA gyrase (bacterial topolsomerase II) , an enzyme required for DNA replication, transcription, 
repair and recombination.  New regimens using quinolones have been shown to decrease the length of 
therapy18.  Both macrolides and quinolones concentrate in macrophages containing mycobacteria.   The Phase 
I Pulmonary Trial also demonstrate s improvement in T cell biologic function, as evidenced by [CONTACT_396459]1 
cytokine expression and  proliferation, as well as reversal of T cell anergy demonstrated by [CONTACT_396460] -[ADDRESS_498688] been only two peer-reviewed clinical trials of antibiotic therapy in sarcoidosis patients .  One 
demonstrated clinical benefit of antimycobacterial therapy in sarc oidosis subjects 19 ; the other reported 
improvement in FVC among sarcoidosis subjects completing an [ADDRESS_498689] as consistent with sarcoidosis.  Molecular 
analysis of 16 sarcoidosis specimens for mutations in mycobacterial rp oB (active site for rifampin ), and DNA 
gyrase (levaquin) had been previously performed.  No mutations that confer resistance were detected.  
Azithromycin was included because it concentrates in host macrophages, where we suspect viable 
mycobacteria reside.   Ethambutol was included because of its inhibition of cell wall synthesis. The patient 
was started on a regimen of levaquin, ethambutol, azithromycin and rifampin.  He experienced complete 
resolution of his lesions by [CONTACT_396461], and they did not recur dur ing the remaining six months of his life.  
Recently a clinical trial of this regimen in cutaneous sarcoidosis patients was conducted at Vanderbilt.  The 
results were compelling in that macroscopic and pathologic improvement in these lesions was observed, a fter 
completion of the regimen (Drake, Vanderbilt).  Vanderbilt has completed a Phase I Pulmonary Trial of the 
CLEAR regimen on  [ADDRESS_498690], and perception of dyspnea (Saint George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6004]).

2.  Objectives  
 
2.1 Primary Objective   
 
To assess the efficacy and safety of oral CLEAR therapy in patients with confirmed progressive 
pulmonary sarcoidosis.   
       
2.2  Hypothesis  
The CLEAR regimen  will improve absolute FVC  percent predicted  in chronic pulmonary 
sarcoidosis participant s by [CONTACT_396462] T cell responses through the normalization of p56Lck 
expression and IL -2 production.    
 
3. Endpoints  
 
3.1 Primary Endpoint  
• Determine the effect of CLEAR therapy versus placebo on the change in p redicted absolute forced 
vital capacity (FVC) in participant s with pulmonary sarcoidosis , comparing baseline with 
performance after completion of 16 weeks of therapy.   
 
3.2 Secondary Endpoints:  
• Change in  FEV1  
• Radiographic improvement   in sarcoidosis lung disease  by [CONTACT_396463] x -ray .  Local investigators 
will score chest x -rays.  This analysis correlates roentgenographic findings with physiologic 
parameters 22.  
• Change in 6 minute walk distance , oxygen saturation and level of dyspnea.  
• Change in the Saint George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ ; King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire 
(KSQ) for the assessment of health status; The Fatigue Assessme nt Scale (FAS) . 
• Necessity of escalating immunosuppressive therapy secondary to continued clinical deterioration, 
after study enrollment.  
• Safety profile of regimen as evidenced by [CONTACT_396464], tolerability and 
toxicity of the tre atment regimen  including c omparison of reported adverse events and abnormal 
laboratory values compared to placebo.  
• Increase in T cell biologic function  through normalization of p56Lck and IL -2 expression . 
• Decrease in peripheral and pulmonary T cell responses against ESAT -[ADDRESS_498692] 
affected by [CONTACT_396465] .   
 
4.2  Special Populations  
The demographic profiles of Vanderbilt show that the aggregate patient population contains 
representative proportions of minorities and women. Recruitment of minorities and women will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_23164]. If necessary, additional recru itment efforts will be made with 
collaborators to ensure that the aggregate patient sample contains appropriate gender and minority

 subsets. Pregnant women will be excluded because of the lack of safety data for antimycobacterial 
therapy use during pregnan cy. 
 
This study will not enroll prisoners.  However, it is possible that a participant will be incarcerated after 
enrollment.  If an enrolled individual is incarcerated, then study medications will be stopped and the 
participant will be treated for pulmona ry sarcoidosis  according to the standards of the institution in which 
s/he is incarcerated.  While incarcerated, individuals will not be followed in the study.  When the 
individual is no longer incarcerated, study treatment and/or study follow -up may conti nue, at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_498693] participated in previous sar coidosis studies.  The research coordinator  will screen 
research registry patient  lists to identify potential candidates for enrollment.  Permission to approach 
patients and/or their families will be requested by [CONTACT_282865].  Community physicians will 
be made aware using an IRB -approv ed recruitment  flyer.  Other recruitment methods may be used 
specific to each site  such as ResearchMatch .  Each of the participating sites have large numbers of 
sarcoidosis patients and have experienced no difficulty in enrolling participant s in the past.  All patients  
contact[CONTACT_396466]  a screening log. If the patient is not enrolled, the screening log 
will include information explaining why enrollment did not occur ( inclusion/ exclusion criteria, attending 
physician denial, patient refusal, lack of immune responses to ESAT -6, etc.).   
  
4.4 Sample Size  
A maximum of 128  participants will be randomized  into one of two arm s: CLEAR therapy or Placebo.  
We need a sample size of [ADDRESS_498694] 90% power to detect a 5% difference 
(5% in CLEAR vs 0% in placebo) in chang e of FVC  percent  predict ed from baseline.   To factor in a 20% 
drop-out rate, we plan to enroll 64 participant s per arm.

exacerbation of drug allergy or possibly drug toxicity.  Concomitant obstructive lung disease could hinder 
detection of clinical improvement.  Patients who are negative for ESAT -6 immune responses will not be 
included because Phase I trial demonstrated minimal or no improvement in FVC with the CLEAR 
regimen.   Ethambutol is associated with optic neuropathy  including optic neuritis or retrobulbar neuritis

been reported i n participants on therapy <90 days.  Levaquin can prolong the QT interval or induce 
Torsades de Pointe.  Other exclusions are related either to safety or complexity and potential for 
interfering with assessing a response to CLEAR therapy.  
 
5.  Study Design  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled, prospective investigation of the 
efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in pulmonary sarcoidosis, using Concomitant Levaquin, 
Ethambutol, Azithromycin and Rifamycin * (CLEAR) .  The objectiv e is t o assess the efficacy and safety 
of oral CLEAR therapy in participants with clinically active pulmonary sarcoidosis. We anticipate that

 CLEAR  therapy will increase pulmonary function as evidence in by [CONTACT_396470]. We anticipate that these improvements will reduce or resolve the necessity of 
immunosuppressant therapy in these participant s.   
 
* Either Rifamp in or Rifabutin, but not both, will be administered based on whether the patient is on other 
medications that are metabolized by [CONTACT_35233] P450 pathway.  Rifampin is a potent inducer of 
cytochrome P450; rifabutin is a potent rifamycin antibiotic, but has much less induction of cytochrome 
P450.   Rifabutin should be used if ri fampin drug interactions are possible. If the patient is on cytochrome 
P450 metabolized drugs the patient will receive Rifabutin. If not, the patient may receive Rifampin  or 
Rifabut in.  See Appendix A  for known drug interactions with Rifampin  or Appendix B  for known drug 
interactions with Rifabutin . If the drug in question is not listed, please use Lexi -Comp software to look up 
compatibility or contact [CONTACT_145859].  
 
5.1 Blinding and Rand omization  
Participant s will be randomized to either CLEAR therapy or placebo at a ratio of 1 to 1 stratifying by [CONTACT_396471] >[ADDRESS_498699] of the clinical trial.   The Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy will provide each site with the 
study drugs and  site-specific treatment a ssignments .  The placebos and colored capsules will be obtained 
by [CONTACT_25733].  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_396438] (each a different color) or placebo will be 
prepared and dispensed by [CONTACT_25733]’s study pharmacy.  A pa rticipant ’s treatment assignment will only be 
revealed outside the pharmacy if a clinic al emergency necessitates unblind ing their treatment  or if 
requested by [CONTACT_4318] .  Neither pa rticipants , clinical providers, nor those influencing recruitment 
decisions or interpretation of d ata will be aware of the treatment that is assigned or the order that 
treatments will be allocated.   
 
Patients will be considered enrolled  upon randomization.  Patients receiving any amount of study drug 
will be considered treated.  Patients discontinued from receipt of study drug for any reason, will continue 
to follow all other protocol requirements for the entire [ADDRESS_498700] s and the DSMB will be unblinded  to randomization assignments.  
There are safety issues associated the CLEAR regimen; for example, levaquin and prolongation of the QT 
interval.  If there i s a significant safety issue thought related to study drug, all four study drugs within the 
regimen should be stopped and the patient followed until stabilization or resolution of this issue.  Efforts 
will be made to unblind  only individuals not associated with the research and who need to know, such as 
an att ending physician. Should un -blind ing of an individual become necessary during the study, the 
investigator at the clinical site should contact [CONTACT_259373] (CCC) for 
approv al and specific unblinding  instructions.  
 
Matching placebo will be provided for each of the CLEAR therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. At the site, only the unblind ed 
pharmacist should know the randomization assignment for an individual patient. Riboflavin will be added 
to the pla cebos for Rifampin and Rifabutin to assu re participants are not unblinded  due to lack of 
discoloration of urine, tears.  
 
5.2  Study Drug Information  
 
5.2.1 Levaquin  
The mechanism of action of levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone antimicrobials involves i nhibition of 
DNA gyrase (bacterial topolsomerase II), an enzyme required for DNA replication, transcription, repair 
and recombination.  Levofloxacin is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_396439]. 
Peak plasma concentrations are us ually attained one to two hours after oral dosing. The absolute

14 
 bioavailability of a 500 mg tablet and a 750 mg tablet of levofloxacin are both approximately 99%, 
demonstrating complete oral absorption of levofloxacin. Following a single intravenous dose o f 
levofloxacin to healthy volunteers, the mean ±SD peak plasma concentration attained was 6.2 ±1.0 µg/mL 
after a 500 mg dose infused over 60 minutes and 11.5 ±4.0 µg/mL after a 750 mg dose infused over 90 
minutes. Levofloxacin oral solution and tablet form ulations are bioequivalent23.  
Levofloxacin pharmacokineti cs are linear and predictable after single and multiple oral or i.v. dosing 
regimens. Steady -state conditions are reached within 48 hours following a 500 mg or 750 mg once -daily 
dosage regimen. The mean ±SD peak and trough plasma concentrations attained fo llowing multiple once -
daily oral dosage regimens were approximately 5.7 ±1.4 and 0.5 ±0.2 µg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 
8.6 ±1.9 and 1.1 ±0.4 µg/mL after the 750 mg doses, respectively. The mean ±SD peak and trough plasma 
concentrations attained follow ing multiple once -daily i.v. regimens were approximately 6.4 ±0.8 and 0.6 
±0.2 µg/mL after the 500 mg doses, and 12.1 ±4.1 and 1.3 ±0.71 µg/mL after the 750 mg doses, 
respectively.  
Oral administration of 500 mg levaquin with food prolongs the time to peak  concentration by 
[CONTACT_3450] 1 hour and decreases the peak concentration by [CONTACT_3450] 14% following tablet and 
approximately 25% following oral solution administration. Therefore, levaquin tablets can be 
administered without regard to food.  
 
Adverse Drug reactions for Levaquin  
Common  (>3%):  in US clinical trials were nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and 
dizziness. An increased chance of problems with the joints and tissues around the joints has been 
observed in pediatric p atients receiving levaquin and the safety in pediatric patients treated for more than 
14 days has not been studied.   
 
Uncommon  (<3%):   tear of a tendon,  increased r isk of tendinitis, tendon rupture in all ages , allergic 
reaction, liver function problems, nervous system effects (tremors, anxiety, lightheadedness, depression, 
insomnia (trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]),  diarrhea, nerve problems such as numbness or tingling in your hands/feet, 
abnormal heart rhythms, changes in your blood sugar levels, sensitivity to light, nausea, headache,  
constipation and dizziness.   
 
Rare :  (<1%):  prolong ed the QT interval or induce d Torsades de Pointes  (it should not be used in 
patients with known prolonged QT intervals  or a family history of such ), increased risk of tendinitis and 
tendon rupture in all ages. This risk is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in 
patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart, or lung transplants [21] , shortness 
of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, upset stomach, rash, itching, suicidal thoughts , and swelling  in your 
arms or legs, chest pain.  
 
5.2.2  Ethambutol   
Ethambutol works by [CONTACT_396472] . Mycolic acids  attach to the 5' -hydroxyl 
groups of D-arabinose  residues of arabinogalactan  and form mycolyl -arabinogalactan -peptidoglycan 
complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by [CONTACT_396473] . Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads 
to increased permeability of the cell wall.  Ethambutol diffuses in to actively growing mycobacterium cells 
such as tubercle bacilli. Ethambutol appears to inhibit the synthesis of one or more metabolites, thus 
causing impairment of cell metabolism, arrest of multiplication, and cell death.  In regards to its 
pharmacokinet ics, Ethambutol is about 75 to 80% absorbed after an oral dose. Absorption is rapid and 
does not seem to be affected by [CONTACT_8208].  
 
Following a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg of body weight, ethambutol attains a peak serum level of 2 to 5 
µg/mL 2 to 4 hours afte r administration. No drug accumulation has been observed with consecutive single 
daily doses of 25 mg/kg in patients with normal kidney function, although marked accumulation has been 
demonstrated in patients with renal insufficiency. Serum concentrations are undetectable 24 hours after 
April 5, 2018

Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Trial  (CLEAR II)  
Vers ion 10.[ADDRESS_498701] dose except in some patients with abnormal renal function24.  
 
Ethambutol distributes widely i nto body fluids and tissues. Concentrations in erythrocytes may reach 2 to 
3 times the plasma concentrations. It also appears in the lungs, kidneys, urine, and saliva, and to lesser 
extents in pleural and ascitic fluids. Ethambutol crosses the placenta. CS F concentrations reaching 10 to 
50% of serum concentrations may occur with inflamed meninges. Ethambutol is not highly bound to 
plasma proteins. Its volume of distribution is about 1.6 L/kg.  
 
The half -life of ethambutol is about 3 to 4 hours in patients w ith normal renal function; it may be as long 
as 7 to 8 hours in patients with renal insufficiency and 18 to 20 hours in the anephric patient.  
 
Within 24 hours after oral administration, approximately 50% of the initial dose is excreted unchanged in 
the ur ine, while an additional 8 to 15% appears as inactive metabolites. The main metabolic path appears 
to be an initial oxidation of the alcohol to an aldehydic intermediate, followed by [CONTACT_186863] a 
dicarboxylic acid. From 20 to 22% of the initial dose is excreted in the feces as unchanged drug.   
 
Adverse Drug Reactions for Ethambutol  
Common (>10%):   Appetite loss; disorientation; dizziness; general body discomfort; headache; nausea, 
stomach upset, vomiting  
 
Uncommon (<3 %): Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives ; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the 
chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); chest pain or tightness; confusion; dark urine; easy 
bruising or bleeding; fever, chills, or sore throat; hallucinations; joint pain, swelling, or sever e tenderness; 
lower back pain; numbness or tingling of the hands, legs, or feet; severe stomach pain; swollen glands in 
the neck or armpit; vision loss or other vision changes; yellowing of the skin or eyes.  
 
Rare (<1%) :  decreases in visual acuity , including irreversible blindness , which appear to be due to optic  
neuritis . Optic neuropathy  including optic neuritis or retrobulbar neuritis occ urring in association with 
ethambutol therapy  may be characterized by [CONTACT_396474]: decreased visual acuity, 
scotoma, color blindness, and/or visual defect. T hese events have also been reported in the absence of a 
diagnosis  of optic or retrobulbar neuritis.   Optic neuropathy has not been reported in participant s on 
therapy <90 days.  
 
5.2.3Azithromycin  
Macrolides inhibit RNA -dependent protein synthesis by [CONTACT_396475] 50 S ribosomal subunits 
of susceptible microorganisms. Its pharmacokinetics  are as follows: The bioavailability of azithromycin 
after oral administration is a pproximately 40%. Administration with food, particularly a high fat meal, 
increases the maximum concentration, but does not affect the overall absorption of the drug. In a study of 
adults receiving a standard regimen of 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg o n days 2 -5, the maximum 
concentration was 0.24 mcg/ml, with a time to achieve maximum concentration of 3.2 hours and an 
average area under the concentration curve (AUC) of 2.1 mcg·hr/ml. Azithromycin is widely distributed 
throughout the body, with a volume  of distribution in adults of 31.1 L/kg. Protein binding is concentration 
dependent, ranging from 7 to 51%. Azithromycin penetrates well into the lungs, tonsils, and middle ear 
fluid, with concentrations exceeding those in the blood. Although azithromycin has extensive tissue 
distribution, only minimal concentrations have been measured in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872].  The primary route 
of elimination of azithromycin is through biliary excretion, as unchanged drug. Only 6 -14% of a dose is 
excreted unchanged in the u rine. Azithromycin has an apparent clearance of 630 ml/min in adults, with a 
terminal elimination half -life of 68 hours25. 
 
Adverse Drug Reactions for Azithromycin  
Common (>10%):  Diarrhea; headache; loose stools; nausea; stomach pain; upset stomach; vomiting.

 Uncommon (<3%) :  Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the

or hearing loss; chest pain; eye or vision problems; irregul ar heartbeat; muscle weakness; pounding in the 
chest; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin; ringing  in the ears; seizure; severe diarrhea; stomach 
cramps/pain; trouble speaking or swallowing; yellowing of the skin or eyes , decreased hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils and blood glucose; elevated serum creat inine phosphokinase, 
potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocy tes, neutrophils 
and eosinophils;  
 
Rare (<1%):  leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, 
basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH and phosphate. The majority of 
participant s with el evated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline.  
 
5.2.4  Rifam ycins (Rifampin or Rifabutin)  
 
5.2.4a  Rifampin   
Rifampin inhibits DNA -dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts 
with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme.  Rifampin is readily 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations in healthy adults and pediatric 
populations vary widely from individual to individual. Following a single 600 mg oral dose of rifampin in 
healthy adults, the peak serum concentration averages 7 mcg/mL but may vary from 4 to 32 mcg/mL. 
Absorption of rifampin is reduced by [CONTACT_2902] 30% when the drug is ingested with food.  
Rifampin is widely distributed throughout the body . It is present in effective concentrations in many 
organs and body fluids, including cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. Rifampin is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_396440], and an 
enterohepatic c irculation ensues. During this process, rifampin undergoes progressive deacetylation so 
that nearly all the drug in the bile is in this form in about 6 hours. This metabolite is microbiologically 
active. Intestinal reabsorption is reduced by [CONTACT_396476],  and elimination is facilitated. Up to 30% of a 
dose is excreted in the urine, with about half of this being unchanged drug.  Rifampin is about 80% 
protein bound. Most of the unbound fraction is not ionized and, therefore, diffuses freely into tissues.  
In healthy adults, the mean biological half -life of rifampin in serum averages 3.35 ± 0.66 hours after a 
600 mg oral dose, with increases up to 5.08 ± 2.45 hours reported after a 900 mg dose. With repeated 
administration, the half -life decreases and reache s average values of approximately 2 to 3 hours. The half -
life does not differ in patients with renal failure at doses not exceeding 600 mg daily, and consequently, 
no dosage adjustment is required. Following a single 900 mg oral dose of rifampin in patient s with 
varying degrees of renal insufficiency, the mean half -life increased from 3.6 hours in healthy adults to 
5.0, 7.3, and 11.0 hours in patients with glomerular filtration rates of 30 to 50 mL/min, less than 30 
mL/min, and in anuric patients, respectiv ely. 
 
5.2.4b  Rifabutin   
Rifabutin is an antimycobacterial agent. It is a semisynthetic ansamycin antibiotic derived from rifamycin 
S. Mycobutin  capsules for oral administration contain [ADDRESS_498702] with mean (±SD) 
peak plasma levels (Cmax) of 375 (±267) ng/ml (range: 141 -1033 ng/ml) attained in 3.3 (±0.9) hours 
(Tmax rang e: 2-4 hours). Plasma concentrations post -Cmax declined in an apparent biphasic manner. 
Kinetic dose -proportionality has been established over the 300 -600 mg dose range in nine healthy adult 
volunteers (crossover design) and in 16 early symptomatic human i mmunodeficiency virus (HIV) -
positive patients over a 300 -900 mg dose range. Rifabutin was slowly eliminated from plasma in seven 
healthy adult volunteers, presumably because of distribution -limited elimination, with a mean terminal 
half-life of 45 (±17) ho urs (range: 16 -69 hours). Although the systemic levels of rifabutin following 
multiple dosing decreased by 38%, its terminal half -life remained unchanged. Rifabutin, due to its high

Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Trial  (CLEAR II)  
Vers ion 10.0  
17 
 lipophilicity, demonstrates a high propensity for distribution and intrace llular tissue uptake. Estimates of 
apparent steady -state distribution volume (9.3±1.5 L/kg) in five HIV -positive patients, following IV 
dosing, exceed total body water by [CONTACT_396477]. Substantially higher intracellular tissue 
levels than thos e seen in plasma have been observed in both rat and man. The lung to plasma 
concentration ratio, obtained at 12 hours, was found to be approximately 6.5 in four surgical patients 
administered an oral dose. Mean rifabutin steady -state trough levels (Cp,mins s; [ADDRESS_498703] -dose) ranged 
from 50 to 65 ng/ml in HIV -positive patients and in healthy adult volunteers. About 85% of the drug is 
bound in a concentration -independent manner to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.05 -1 
μg/ml. Binding does not appear to be influenced by [CONTACT_396478]26. 
 
Because treatment with rifabutin may be associated with neutropenia, and more rarely thrombocytopenia, 
physicians should consider obtaining hematologic studies periodically in patients receiving rifabutin 
prophylaxis.  Urine, f eces, saliva, sputum, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], tears, and skin may be colored brown -orange with 
rifabutin and some of its metabolites. Soft contact [CONTACT_396479]. Patients to be 
treated with rifabutin should be made aware of these possibilities.  
 
Because of the structural similarity of rifabutin and rifampin, rifabutin may be expected to have some 
effect on these drugs as well. However, unlike rifampin, rifabutin appears not to affect the acetylation of 
isoniazid. When rifabutin was compared with r ifampin in a study with 8 healthy normal volunteers, 
rifabutin appeared to be a less potent enzyme inducer than rifampin.  
 
Adverse Drug Reaction for Rifa mycins (Rifampin or Rifabutin)  
Common (>10%): tired feeling; or red or orange colored urine, stools, tears, sweat, or saliva   
 
Uncommon  (<3 %): Allergic reaction (hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, 
tongue, or throat), fever, chills, body aches, flu symptoms, joint pain or swelling, easy bruising or 
bleeding, weakness, urinat ing less than usual or not at all, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, 
itching, dark urine, clay -colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), neutropenia (a low 
white blood cell count that may make it more likely for you to get infections) .  
 
Rare (<1%):  Rifampin has been shown to produce liver dysfunction. Fatalities associated with jaundice 
have occurred in patients with liver disease  and in patients taking  rifampin with other hepatotoxic agents. 
Patients with impaired liver function should be given rifampin only in cases of necessity and then with 
caution and under strict medical supervision. In these patients, careful monitoring of liver function, 
especial ly SGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST should be carried out prior to therapy and then every [ADDRESS_498704] included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemol ytic anemia, and decreased hemoglobin, 
in less than 1% of patients.  Hyperbilirubinemia and hepatitis have been reported in up to 3% of patients. 
Approximately 50% of hepatotoxicity has been observed during the first month of therapy.  
 
5.3  Study  Drug Dosing and Administration:  
The following  oral CLEAR medications or matching placebo will be introduced as follows:  
 
Day 0  Start : Azithromycin : 250mg po QD  (or 500 3 days/week if toxicity)  x 8 weeks  and  
                          Ethambutol : 1200 mg po QD for >50kg; <50kg 800 mg po QD  (or 3 days/week if   
                          toxicity ) x 8 weeks  
   Rifampin 600 mg QD or Rifa butin  300mg po QD  (or 3 days/week if toxicity)  x 16 weeks  
   Levaquin : 500 mg po QD (or 3 days/week if toxicity ) x 16 weeks  
 
Participant s will  be allowed to take their regimen three times/week instead of daily (which has been 
shown to be equally efficacious) if toxicity occurs that is thought to be drug related.  In addition, if 
toxicity warrants, one or more drugs can be  discontinued and the participant can continue to participate.

their primary care physician to  manage participant’s pain if possible, so the drug does not have to be 
discontinued.  
 
5.4.1  Drug Toxicity During 2 -drug Phase  
To avoid single drug therapy during the 8 weeks of 2 -drug therapy, the following order of replacement 
drug should be followed:  
 
If rifamycin is stopped due to toxicity:  
1st - azithromycin + levaquin  
2nd – ethambutol + levaquin  
3rd – only levaquin  
 
If Levaquin is stopped due to toxicity:  
1st - azithromycin + rifamycin  
2nd – ethambutol + rifamycin  
3rd – only rifamycin  
 
Single drug therapy should be avoided if at all possible.  
 
5.5  Assessment of Drug Adherence :   
Participants should be asked to return the pi[INVESTIGATOR_396441].  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_396442] d reconciled with quantities dispensed, and a review of medication 
diary to assess adherence to prescribed regimen and the onset of new symptoms should be conducted. If a 
participant misses a dose, they will receive guidance on making up missed dose

8. Development of an intercurrent il lness, condition, or procedural complication, which would 
interfere with the participant 's continued participation.  
 
Participants who have stopped taking study drugs may continue to participant in the study and will 
following the appropriate procedures in the protocol.   
 
Any participant  who discontinues treatment for medical reasons, e.g. because of adverse events (AEs) or 
clinical laboratory abnormalities, should be followed up at medically appropriate intervals in order to 
evaluate the course and to ensure reversibility or stabilizatio n of the abnormality or event. If a participant  
fails to return for a scheduled visit, a documented effort must be made to determine the reason. This 
information should be recorded in the study records.  
 
5.7  Premature Withdrawal from Study Participation  
At any time, participant s may withdraw from the study (i.e., withdraw consent to participate) at their own 
request.  Participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator 
and in accordance with his/her clinical jud gment. No disadvantage will arise for any participant  who 
withdraws consent for participation at any time or who is withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_737].  
 
Reasons for discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the CR F in any 
case and may include the following:  
• Participant 's request for withdrawal  
• Investigator's decision that discontinuation is in the best interest of the participant  
• Participant  is lost to follow -up 
 
Participant s who elect  to stop treatment will be asked to complete  at minimum,  follow -up spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. 
Any participant  who discontinues treatment for medical reasons, e.g. because of adverse events (AEs) or 
clinical laboratory abnormalities, should be followed up at medically appr opriate intervals in order to

fails to return for a scheduled visit, a documented effort must be made to determine the reason. This 
information s hould be recorded in the study records.  
 
Participan ts whose clinicians feel that an escalation in their baseline therapy is warranted will be allowed 
to receive up to [ADDRESS_498708] art a new therapy, they will be considered a treatment failure 
and they will be asked to come in to complete the end of study visit, which is the same as the month 4 
visit.

7. Statistical C onsiderations  
 
7.1 Statistical Methods  
 
7.1.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The comparison between CLEAR and placebo arms will be made using the Students’s  t-test.  Normality 
of the primary endpoint will be examined using Kolmogorov -Smirnov test.  If normality is violated, the 
comparison between CLEAR and placebo arms will be made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
 
The primary endpoint of this study is the a rithmetic difference between %FVC predicted value 
measured at baseline and week [ADDRESS_498710]-randomization %FVC predicted value measurement at the value closest to 16 
weeks from randomiz ation within a window of 12 weeks to 20 weeks from randomization.  This 
more accurately represents the data collected at 16 weeks on study due to the variability of visit 
schedules resulting from staggering the start of study drugs and patient scheduling.  To 
understand the trajectory of improvement with CLEAR therapy, we will also be measuring the 
%FVC predicted value at weeks 4 and 8.  If the improvement is linear in time, the rate of 
improvement (slope of change) may be reported as a secondary endpoint i n the study.     
 
This analysis is an exploratory analysis.   Mixed effect models will be used to analyze these repeated 
measures with a random subject effect and with the treatment (CLEAR versus placebo) and the time trend 
(baseline, week  4, week  8, and wee k 16) as fixed effects.  For the error covariance, we will use 
autoregressive model of order 1 [AR(1) ] or other plausible covariance structures.  The focus of this study 
will be the treatment effect and the time trend of the endpoint; however, mixed effect  models also provide 
the flexibility of controlling for and evaluating covariates such age, race, and gender.    
 
7.1.2  Approaches to the Analysis  
The following 2 approaches will be used for the analyses:  
• Intention -to-Treat All patients with a post-treatment endpoint measurement will be  
             included. This will be considered the primary analysis and performed for all endpoints.  
 
• Per Protocol This will be performed as a secondary analysis for the primary endpoint only. A  
patient who is i dentified as a major protocol violator will not be included. Protocol violators will 
be considered as follows:  1) Realize that patient did not meet Inclusion Criteria after enrolled 
into study; 2) Find an Exclusion criteria after enrolled into the study; 3) Regimen was

23 
 permanently stopped before 4 weeks; 4) Exacerbation requiring greater than 2 weeks of 
prednisone escalation.   Major protocol  violators will  also be defined based on criteria that will be 
identified  prior to unblinding the database.   
     
7.1.3 Multiplicity:  Since there is only 1 primary comparison for 1 primary endpoint for each study aim, 
and other comparisons are secondary and supportive, no multiplicity adjustment will be  applied.  
 
7.1.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
For continuous s econdary endpoints, statistical analyses will be conducted using the same methods as 
described for the primary endpoint.  For binary endpoints such as >10%  improvement on FVC, the 
Pearson chi -square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to assess them  between the two arm s. If 
imbalance on certain important covariates which might impact these binary endpoints is observed  
between the treatment arm s, logistic regression to control for these covariates may be conducted.  
The safety endpoint such as death, AE, SAE, drug -related AE, drug -related SAE, abnormal lab values, 
tolerability and toxicity of the treatment regimen, will be summarized (count and percent) by [CONTACT_396481].  Between CLEAR  and placebo comparison on these endpoints will 
be made using the Pearson chi -square test or Fisher's exact test.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_498711] whether missingness on the primary endpoint depends on covariates and whether the 
missing data mechanism is ignorable. After a good understanding about the missing data mechanism, we 
will adopt two strategies to deal with missing data. The multiple imputation method that incorporates 
predictive mean matching and flexible additive imputation models as implemented in the aregImpute  
function in the Hmisc package (Harrell, 2013, page 12) in R will be used. We will also conservatively 
impute missing data to perform sensitivity analyses. Imputing strategies could be last -value -carry -forward 
(we believe this imputation is conservative since subjects on placebo may get worse and subjects on 
CLEAR may get better if they stayed in the study, and we assume a fla t carry -forward) or we could 
assume a spontaneous improvement rate for the placebo arm estimated from the non -missing data if that 
is observed. The primary analysis is the intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis of the complete data set. These 
additional analyse s that deal with missing data are secondary and they are to corroborate study findings 
from the primary ITT analysis.  
 
7.2   Randomization  
Participants  will be randomized to either CLEAR therapy or placebo at a ratio of 1 to 1 stratifying by [CONTACT_396471] > [ADDRESS_498712] be blinded .  Randomization marks the patient’s 
official entry into the  Study .  Once a participant has been started on the assigned study treatment, efforts 
will be made to conduct all evaluations irrespective of whether the participants complete the study 
treatment reg imen or no t, or how well the participants complies with the study treatment regimen.  These 
efforts should continue until termination of the study .  Data collections will continue even if medication 
must be stopped.  
For the intention to treat analysis, par ticipant s will be considered treated  when the first study drug is 
taken , regardless of the amount of study drug they receive .  Participant s discontinued from receipt of

24 
 study drug for any reason, will continue to follow all other protocol requirements for the entire study 
period to the extent that the informed consent is still active.  
 
7.3   Sample Size Justification  
Sample size is calculated for primary endpoint;  change from baseline of FVC percent predicted.  Using  
data from [ADDRESS_498713] 90% 
power to detect a 5% difference (5% in CLEAR vs. 0% in placebo) in ch ange of FVC percent predicted 
from baseline.  To factor in a 20% dropout rate, we plan to enroll 64 subjects per arm.  This brings the 
sample size to 128 participants.  In the Phase I trial, we experienced a higher drop rate 30%, but review of 
the clinical  data demonstrates that patients with advanced disease accounted for the majority of the study 
withdraw als.  The Phase II trial will allow patients to drop one study drug, and will include a research 
nurse coordinator to encourage study participation.  W e anticipate that we will have not have as high a 
study withdraw al rate.  
 
7.4   Interim Monitoring  
The DSMB will  receive a report of adverse events  (blinded by [INVESTIGATOR_216]) after [ADDRESS_498714] 15 participant’s data by 
[CONTACT_303920].  An interim safety analysis  will also be performed  after 50 participants  complet e 
study  drug treatment .  This interim analysis will be presented to the DSMB by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_396446]/her designee .  The results will be blinded and presented on a coded study arm  
basis (i.e. A and B arm) unless the DSMB  votes to receive unblin ded data. The interim analysis 
will focus on the safety profile of the study treatments. These analyses will be conducted based 
on the methods specified in the Data Analysis Plan for the safety endpoints. Since the interim 
analysis is not designed to draw formal inference on these safety endpoints, the magnitude of the 
between -treatment differences and the p -values will be provided solely to help the DSMB to 
evaluate the safety profile. Although efficacy data will also be presented, no early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_396447] , because it is unlikely that an 
efficacy study of less than [ADDRESS_498715] (DSMB ) 
The committee will consist of three members, in addition to the study statistician.  DSMB will be 
comprised of adult specialists with extensive clinical experience in sarcoidosis/ interstitial lung disease 
and clinical trial research experience. Members will be independent and have no conflict of interests 
related to the study or drug of study. The study statistician will be an ex -officio (non -voting) member of 
the DSMB.

recruitment. The open portion of DSMB reports will be made available to participating sites. Discussions 
and actions i tems from the closed portion of the meeting will remain confidential.  In the event of slow 
patient recruitment, the DSMB will meet by [CONTACT_396483] 6 months for year one, then annually 
to review the safety analyses conducted by [CONTACT_396484] (DCC) and determine whether 
the study should be (a) allowed to continue, (b) modified, or (c) discontinued.  
 
All severe adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the DSMB as well as to all the IRBs involved in the 
study. The DSMB may choose at any time to have an additional DSMB meeting to determine if a change 
in protocol or informed consent is needed based on SEAs. Also, the DSMB will comment on the SAEs in 
their yearly report; the committee will also supervise the preparation of the interim c onfidential reports.  
 
8. Data Collection and Site Monitoring  
 
8.[ADDRESS_498718] will require careful attention to the training of 
research personnel at the Clinical Core Coordinating Center and participating sites.  Training sessions for 
the Study Coordinators and key personnel wil l be held prior to the initiation of patient recruitment.  The 
protocol, forms, and other materials will be distributed to th e appropriate personnel .  Each center’s 
personnel will be trained centrally in the study requirements, standardization measurement of height, 
weight, phlebotomy, and requirements for laboratory specimen collection including counseling on 
adherence, and in eliciting of information from study participants in a reproducible manner.  
 
Training  will be performed  by [CONTACT_396485]. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
data to be collected and the procedures to be conducted at each visit will be reviewed in detail.  Data 
collection forms and the nature of the required information will also be discussed in detail.  Entering  data

also be covered during the training session.   
 
8.2   Site  Monitoring  
Sites will be monitored on a regular basis by [CONTACT_396486] (CCC) , to ensure that all 
regulatory requirements are met and to monitor the quality of the data collected. Records of Institutional 
Review Board approvals will be faxed or sent electronically to the CCC.   REDCap database automated 
range checking may be utilized to alert data entry personnel when data out of range is entered.  Data 
quality assurance checks will be performed to assure the data are as accurate as possible prior to locking 
the database. If erroneous or inappropriately missing data are not ed from any one site, the CCC will 
develop a corrective action plan for the site(s) involved.  
9. Risk Assessment  
 
9.1 Risks of Antimycobacterial Therapy (Levaquin, Ethambutol, Azithromycin, and Rifamycin )  
Potential risks of study drugs are described belo w. All of the prescribed medications are well tolerated 
and adverse events are reports in less than 0.7% of patients.  We are using the current FDA recommended 
doses.  
 
9.1.1 Levaquin:   
Common  (>3%):  in US clinical trials were nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and 
dizziness. An increased chance of problems with the joints and tissues around the joints has been 
observed in pediatric patients receiving levaquin and the safety in pediatric patients treated for more than 
14 days has not been studied.   
 
Uncommon  (<3%):   tear of a tendon,  increased r isk of tendinitis, tendon rupture in all ages  allergic 
reaction, liver function problems, nervous system effects (tremors, anxiety, lightheadedness, depression, 
insomnia (trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]),diarrhea, nerve problems such as numbness or tingling in your hands/feet, 
abnormal heart rhythms, changes in your  blood sugar levels, sensitivity to light, nausea, headache,  
constipation and dizziness.   
 
Rare (<1%): prolong ed the QT interval or induce d Torsades de Pointes  (it should not be used in patients 
with known prolonged QT intervals  or a family history of su ch), increased risk of tendinitis and tendon 
rupture in all ages. This risk is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients 
taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart, or lung transplants [21] , shortnes s of 
breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, upset stomach, rash, itching, swelling in your arms or legs, chest pain.  
 
9.1.2 Ethambutol:   
Common (>10%):   Appetite loss; disorientation; dizziness; general body discomfort; headache; nausea, 
stomach upset, vomiting  
 
Uncommon (<3%):  Severe allergic reactions ( rash; hives ; itching ; difficulty breathing; tightness in the 
chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); chest pain or tightness; confusion; dark urine; easy 
bruising or bleeding; fever, chills, or sore throat; hallucinations; joint pain, swelling, or severe tendern ess; 
lower back pain; numbness or tingling of the hands, legs, or feet; severe stomach pain; swollen glands in 
the neck or armpit; vision loss or other vision changes; yellowing of the skin or eyes.  
 
Rare (<1%) :  decreases in visual acuity , including irreversible blindness , which appear to be due to optic  
neuritis . Optic neuropathy  including optic neuritis or retrobulbar neuritis occurring in  association with 
ethambutol therapy  may be characterized by [CONTACT_396474]: decreased visual acuity, 
scotoma, color blindness, and/or visual defect. These events have also been reported in the absence of a 
diagnosis  of optic or retrobulbar neuritis.   Optic neuropathy has not been reported in participant s on 
therapy <90 days

chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); bloody stools; changes in hearing 
or hearing loss; chest pain; eye or vision probl ems; irregular heartbeat; muscle weakness; pounding in the 
chest; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin; ringing  in the ears; seizure; severe diarrhea; stomach 
cramps/pain; trouble speaking or swallowing; yellowing of the skin or eyes ;   decreased hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, l ymphocytes, neutrophils and blood glucose; elevated serum creat inine phosphokinase, 
potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils 
and eosinophils;  
 
Rare (<1%):  leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium,  potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, 
basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH and phosphate. The majority of 
participant s with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline.  
 
9.1.4  Rifamycins (rifampin  or rifabutin):   
Common (>10%): tired feeling; or red or orange colored urine, stools, tears, sweat, or saliva   
 
Uncommon  (<3%):  Allergic reaction ( hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, 
tongue, or throat), fever, chills, body aches, flu symptoms, joint pain or swelling, easy bruising or 
bleeding, weakness, urinating less than usual or not at all, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, 
itching, dark urine, clay -colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), neutropen ia (a low 
white blood cell count that may make it more likely for you to get infections).   
 
Rare (<1%):  Rifampin has been shown to produce liver dysfunction. Fatalities associated with jaundice 
have occurred in patients with liver disease  and in patients taking rifampin with other hepatotoxic agents. 
Patients with impaired liver function should be given rifampin only in cases of necessity and then with 
caution and under stric t medical supervision. In these patients, careful monitoring of liver function, 
especially SGPT/ALT and SGOT/AST should be carried out prior to therapy and then every [ADDRESS_498719] included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, and decreased hemoglobin, 
in less than 1% of patients.  Hyperbilirubinemia and hepatitis have been reported in up to 3% of patients. 
Approximately 50% of h epatotoxicity has been observed during the first month of therapy.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_498720] blood drawn for research purposes. Risks of drawing blood are uncommon and 
include bleeding and bruising, and a rare risk of fainting or i nfection.  
 
9.3  Risks of Bronchoscopy  
Bronchoscopy is very safe, but no procedure is entirely free of potential risk. The chance of serious 
complications is reported to be less than 0.05% (5 in 10,000). Local discomfort (coughing, gagging, and 
soreness of your nose and throat) are frequently u navoidable but can be greatly diminished with 
medication. Nosebleed, wheezing (about 1% chance), a decrease in blood oxygen requiring that requires 
wearing an oxygen mask, low grade fever (less than a 5% chance), lung infection (pneumonia) in less 
than 0.1 %, and coughing up small flecks of blood for 24 hours after the procedure (as a result of minor 
trauma to the bronchial lining) may occur (less than a 5% chance). Vocal Cord spasm can result in 
hoarseness and bronchial spasm can cause wheezing or shortness  of breath. Mild bronchitis is common 
after bronchoscopy. Occasionally, antibiotics and/or a short course of corticosteroids are required if 
patients are significantly symptomatic. More serious complications such as major bleeding, lung collapse,

Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Trial  (CLEAR II)  
Vers ion 10.[ADDRESS_498721] been reported but are very rare. It is not 
expected that patients will experience all of these side effects.  
 
9.4  Minimization of Risks  
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46.111(a) (1) requires that risks to subj ects are minimized by [CONTACT_191693]. There are several elements of study design in 
the present protocol that meets this human subject protection requirement.  
 
Several of the exclusion criteria prohibit par ticipation of patients who might be at increased risk from the 
effects of antimycobacterial therapy. For example, patients who have intolerances or allergies to any drug 
in this regimen, pregnancy, and who are taking medications that may unfavorably intera ct with a drug in 
the regimen are excluded. Also, we will monitor for adverse effects to liver and muscle by [CONTACT_396487]. We will stop study medications if the ALT rises to more than [ADDRESS_498722] Involvement  
The protocol and the informed consent document s to be used in this study will  be submitted to the 
investigator’s local IRB for approval.  Written do cumentation of approval of the protocol and the 
informed consent documents must be pro vided to CC C before starting the study.   
The investiga tor will promptly report to their local IRB a ll changes in the research activity and all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others, and will not make changes in the 
research without prior IRB approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to 
human su bjects.  
 
10.2  Equitable Selection of Participant s 
The exclusion criteria for this study neither unjustly exclude classes of individuals from participation in 
the research nor unjustly include classes of individuals from participation in the research.   
 
10.3  Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the patient  or patient’s legally authorized representative  
understands the risks and benefits of participating in the study, and answering any questions the patient 
may have throughout the study and sharing any new information in a timely manner that may be relevant 
to the patient’s willingness to continue his or her participation in the trial.  Prior to a participant’s 
enrollment  in the study , the investigator will ensure that the purpose of the study is explained to the 
patient and that written consent is obtained.

 All study participants will be informed of the objectives of the study and the potential risks. The informed 
consent document will be used to explain the risks and benefits of study participation to the patient in 
simple terms before the patient is entered  into the study, and to document that the patient is satisfied with 
his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the study and desires to participate in 
the study. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent  is given by [CONTACT_92373]. This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent 
document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study 
agent.  
 
The patien t will receive a copy of his/her signed consent form.  The investigator will retain a copy of the

10.3  Confidentiality  
At the beginning of the study, each patient will be assigned a unique identification number and a study 
code.  In any individual tabulation, participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_6227].  The medical records  of 
participants in CLEAR Trial will be confidential.  All procedures will be in compliance with HIPAA 
regulations.  
 
To maintain confidentiality, evaluation forms and reports entered into the study database will be 
identified only by [CONTACT_2299]’s coded number.  The coded number will be generated at random by a 
computer, and only the study investigators will have access identity of the participant corresponding to 
the codes.  All electr onic records will be kept in a locked, password protected computer.  All computer 
entry and networking programs will be done with coded numbers only.  All source documents containing 
the participant’s identifiable information will be maintained in a locked  cabinet inside a locked office.  
Clinical information will not be released without the written permission of the patient, except as necessary 
for monitoring by [CONTACT_4707], National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the Federal 
Drug Adm inistration or other authorized Federal Agencies, and the Clinical Coordinating Center.  
 
Data will be entered into REDCap, an electronic web -based database, for storage and only research staff 
with appropriate permissions will be allowed to access the data base.  Data will be automatically 
sequestered by [CONTACT_396488]’s data, but not data 
collected at other sites.  Primary study coordinators will have no access to case report form data views, 
but will inst ead have rights to use a single export module designed to enable export of all site data.  No 
identifiable information, with the exception of dates will be collected.  To allow for remote monitoring, 
source documents containing patient identifiers may be uploaded into REDCap, a HIPAA secure, 
password protected web -based database.  
 
 
11. Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators will determine if any clinical adverse experiences occur during the period from enrollment 
through study month [ADDRESS_498724].  The investigator will 
evaluate any changes in laboratory values and physical signs and will determine if the change is clinically 
important and different from what is expected in the course of treatment of patients with s arcoidosis.  If 
clinically important and unexpected adverse experiences occur, they will be recorded on the adverse event 
case report form.

 11.1 Reportable Adverse Event  
For this trial, a reportable adverse event  is defined as:  
• Any clinically important untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study drug or 
undergoing study procedures which is different from what is expected in the clinical course of a 
sarcoidosis patient or,  
• Any clinically important, untoward medical occurrence that i s thought to be associated with the 
study drug or procedures, regardless of the “expectedness” of the event for the course of a 
sarcoidosis patient.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_498725] no later than 5 calendar days after the 
investigator discovers the event.  
 
 
The Clinical Coordinating Center will report all serious, unexpected , and study -related adverse events to 
the DSMB, by [CONTACT_6968], or telephone, within 7 calendar days of the CCC being notified of the event.  A 
written report will be sent to the DSMB within 15 calendar days,  and these reports will be sent to 
investigators for s ubmission to their respective Institutional Review Boards.  The DSMB will also review 
all adverse events during scheduled interim analyses.  The Clinical Coordinating Center will distribute the 
written summary of the DSMB’s periodic review of adverse event s to investigators for submission to their 
respective Institutional Review Boards in accordance with reporting guidelines.  
 
The Clinical Coordinating Center will also determine if the serious adverse event is unexpected for 
CLEAR therapy.  Unexpected is de fined as any event not listed in the package insert for the individual 
antibiotic.  If the Clinical Coordinating Center determines that any serious and study -related adverse 
event is unexpected, the FDA will be notified within [ADDRESS_498726] also report Unanticipated Problems, regardless of severity, associated with the study 
drug within 24 hours.  An unanticipated problem is defined as follows:  
 
11.3 Unanticipated Problem (UP):   
Unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:   
• Unexpected, in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and the characteristics of the participant  population being studied;

 • Related or possibly related to participation in the research, in this guidance document, possibly 
related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_356512] i nvolved in the research;  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
 
 
12. Study Mandated Deviations from Assign ed Treatment Medication Stop 
Points.  
 
12.1. Definition  
• A stop point can only occur after the participant is randomized and denotes the occurrence of an 
event, which necessitates altering the interventions of the study (i.e., cessation of CLEAR therapy or 
placebo). Visits and data collection continue after stop  points. Before a stop point is declared all 
possible measures will be taken to reverse the problem necessitating the stop point. If there is a 
necessary deviation from the randomized intervention, we will minimize the degree of the deviation if 
at all pos sible. If possible the participant will resume the intervention at a later time.  
• General Stop Points:  
1. Pregnancy  
2. ALT >10x upper limit of normal  
3. Intolerable medication -related toxicity  
 
12.2. Measurements at the Time of a Stop Point  
When a Stop Point has been confirmed by [CONTACT_355454], a measurement of complete metabolic profile, CBC, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_396448]  (non-contrasted CT ), if the participant  is not pregnant.  
 
12.3. Follow -Up After Stop Point  
• Following treatment f ailures, which determine the primary and main secondary outcomes, participant 
follow -up will include the following information:  
1. Labs tests including CMP, CBC  
2. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_396449]  
3.  Non Contrasted Chest CT , if the participant  is not pregnant.

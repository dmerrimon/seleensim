SPECIFIC AIMS 
 
The primary objective of this prospective, randomized, double- blinded, controll ed study is to assess 
OA progression following ACL reconstruction  (ACLR) , and to determine how the initial tension applied 
to the graft at the time of surgery may influence disease progression.   ACLR is commonly performed to 
restore joint function and to decrease the risk of post -traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) in the ACL- deficient knee. 
However, clinical studies suggest that the outcome is highly variable, and that OA often progresses  despi[INVESTIGATOR_423769]. The tension applied to the graft at the time of ACLR fixatio n (“initial graft tension”) affects knee 
kinematics and the distribution and magnitude of contact [CONTACT_174120], which in turn, is thought to influence articular cartilage  damage. The effects  of low - and high -initial graft tensions on graft healing and articular cartilage 
degeneration  following ACL R are unknown and are currently under investigation in this study. Over the past 
funding cycle, ACL- injured subjects (108 patients) and matched cont rols (60 subjects) were recruited and 
enrolled. Short -term ( ≤84 months ) post-surgical evaluations have been performed. The objective of this update  
is to prospectively obtain valuable long-term ( 15 year) follow -ups on this captured patient /control  population. 
We intend to follow these patients a minimum of [ADDRESS_535368] treatment group consists of patients whose grafts were  tensioned to 
restore the normal anterior -posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur (“ AP laxity”) at the time o f 
surgery ( i.e. AP laxity equal to that of the contralateral normal knee; the “low -tension” treatment). The second 
treatment group consists of patients whose grafts were  tensioned to over -constrain the joint ( i.e. AP laxity 2mm 
less than that of the  contralateral knee; the “high- tension” treatment). In the last funding cycle, we have shown 
that the initial joint contact [CONTACT_423779] 
39, and 
that the associated laxity differences in patients are different in vivo . The two treatment groups are being 
compared to a third matched control group. Fifty-four subjects were  enrolled into each group. With  this update , 
they will be followed 180 months after surgery. We are planning to follow these patients for a minimum of 15 
years. Significant changes in cartil age integrity are expected within this long- term time frame  in this patient 
population 26,35,50. 
 
Radiographic assessment of joint space narrowing is the only validated indicator of structural change 
used to evaluat e OA progression in clinical studies, and it will continue to be the primary outcome 
measure of cartilage damage 67. MR images of the articular cartilage and associated  knee joint  structures will 
provide secondar y structural biomarkers for the early detection of OA 31. MRI is being used to directly measure 
changes in cartilage thickness  in the load bearing regions  11,12, while joint integrity will be assessed using the 
Whole Organ Magnetic Imaging Score (WORM score) 56. Using these imaging -based outcome measures, we 
will test the primary hypothesis:  
 
● Tibiofemoral joint space width (via radiography) and cartilage thickness (via MRI) in the reconstructed 
knees of the “high -tension” treatment group will be equal to that of the control group, while the joint 
space width and cartilage thickness in the “lo w-tension” treatment group will be significantly less than 
that of the control group 15 years after surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament.  
 
Surgical outcome will also be assessed via: 1) patient -oriented outcome scores 59,76, 2) AP laxity (an 
indicator of graft integrity  6,44 and knee kinematics 23), 3) isokinetic strength (an indicator of  dynamic 
knee function 16), and 4) clinical outcome scores 48,78. Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will 
enable us to determine the l ong-term effects of initial graft tension on cartilage status and knee joint function, 
and to evaluate the relationships  between longitudinal changes that occur in tibiofemoral  (TF) joint space (x -
ray), cartilage thickness (MRI), general MRI scores (WORM score), knee laxity (KT -1000), strength (Biodex 
strength test, [ADDRESS_535369]) and patient -oriented outcome scores (SF- 36, Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score). In the past funding cycle, data  were obtained from ACL -reconstructed patients pre- operatively, 
immediately post -operatively, and after 6, 12, 36, and [ADDRESS_535370] the hypothesis that tibiofemoral (TF) joint space width (via radiography) and cartilage 
thickness (via MRI) in the reconstructed knees of the “high -tension” treatment group will be equal to that of the 
control group , while the joint space width and cartilage thickness in the “low -tension” treatment group will be 
significantly less than that of the control group 15 years after surgical reconstruction of the ACL. We intend to 
follow these patients for a minimum of 15 years. 
 Surgical outcome will also be assessed via: 1) patient -oriented outcome scores 
59,76, 2) AP laxity (an 
indicator of graft integrity  6,44 and knee kinematics 23), 3) isokinetic strength (an indicator of dynamic 
knee function 16), and 4) clinical outcome scores 48,78. Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will 
enable us to determine the long- term effects of initial graft tension on cartilage status and knee joint function, 
and to evaluate the relationships between the longitudinal chang es that occur in TF joint space narrowing (x -
ray), cartilage thickness (MRI), general MRI scores (WORM score), knee laxity ( KT-1000), thigh strength 
(Biodex strength test, [ADDRESS_535371]) and patient -oriented outcome scores (SF- 36, Knee Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score). In the past funding cycle, data were obtained prospectively from ACLR patients and matched 
control subjects f rom the time of recruitment (pre -operative) through [ADDRESS_535372] three years of the initial  
funding cycle.  It was our intent to identify patients with isolated ACL injuries while minimizing confounding 
variables. To do this, all patients who came through the s ports medicine clinics  of University Orthopaedics Inc 
between 02/09/2004 and 02/ 08/2007 were cons idered for the study . All who met the pre-operative inclusion 
criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria (Table 1) were asked to participa te and provide their informed 
consent. Additional “ intra-operative” inclusion /exclusion criteria were then evaluated at the time of surgery 
(Table 1). If the patient remained eligible, minimum likelihood allocation was used to randomly assign each 
subject  to one of the two initial graft tension groups 
1. Randomization was performed to achieve balance 
between the treatment groups for characteristics that would influence long- term outcome and cartilage health; 
age, gender, race, and activ ity level (Tegner score). The number of patients who injured their ACL and choose 
ACLR within the clinical practice was documented, and the reasons for excluding subjects were recorded.  
 60 “matched” control subjects, who had no known history of knee injury or symptoms of arthritis,  were 
recruited from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94685], local colleges, and Providence community.  They  were selected to 
match the frequency of individuals by [CONTACT_654] (± 5 years), gender, race, and activity level (Tegner score ± 1 point). 
The subjects’ knees were evaluated by [CONTACT_423780] a screening visit. Subjects were not included in the 
control group  if they have a side- to-side difference in AP laxity greater than or equal to 2- mm (KT -1000), a 
Tegner activity score less than 5 
69, or if they meet any of the other exclusion criteria ( Table 1). It was our intent 
to establish a control group that matched the characteristics of the population at risk to ACL injury.   
  
3. Research Design  
 This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double -blinded controlled trial comparing the 
outcome of two different initial tension conditions applied to the ACL graft at the time of surgery, and to determine the relationship between factors that may predict who will be risk for OA.  The project 
statistician  and the operating surgeon initially kn ew a patient ’s assignment at the time of surgery, however, the 
  
surgeon was  not allowed to review the assignment once the surgery  was completed, and the statistician was 
not allowed to review the assignments until after all the subjects were enrolled.  The patient, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_423770] -up assessments , the AP laxity and isokinetic strength testing, the engineer performing 
the radiographic joint space width  and cartilage thickness measurements, and the radiologist performing the 
WORM scor ing will continue to be blinded from the subject’s group assignment throughout the  study . An intent -
to-treat protocol is being utilized. All subjects randomized to each group are being followed, and all available 
data will be analyzed even if the graft fails, if the subject is unwilling to perform a particular follow -up test 
(missing da ta), or if a subject completely drops out of the study.

 Patients were included in the study if they were candidates for autogenous ACLR with either a bone -
patellar tendon- bone or a [ADDRESS_535374] shown that 
functional and patient -oriented outcomes are equivalent 2,3,19,33,34,41,42,49,62,64. Finally, the two graft tension 
procedures in this study produced the same AP laxity values between graft types. Other than graft type, all 
surgically related parameters were standardized across surgeons. The same surgical instrumentation within each graft type was used to ensure that intra- articular graft placement was similar between patients. “Aperture” 
fixation interference screws were used to standardize graft fixation. Another variable, which could possibly  
affect outcome, is the rehabilitation program prescribed following surgery 
8. Recent data comparing commonly 
used rehabilitation protocols has shown that rehabilitation with either an “accelerated” or “non -accelerated” 
program would produce the same clinical, functional and patient oriented outcomes 5,8. Nonetheless, all 
  
subjects were required to follow the same “accelerated” rehabilitation program, which was geared to get 
patients back to sport within 6- months.  
 4. Independent variable ( Initial graft tension condition  based on AP laxity ) 
 Two initial graft tension conditions are being compared; 1) a graft tension that resto red the AP laxity of 
the ACLR  knee to that of the contralateral ACL intact  knee (the “low -tension” treatment), and 2) a graft 
tension that reduced the AP laxity by 2mm in comparison to the contralateral ACL-intact  knee (the 
“high- tension” treatment)  at the time of surgery . Thus, a graft tensioning protocol that is based on the AP 
laxity at the time of graft fixation (“laxity -based” approach) was selected for this study instead of a “tension-
based” approach 
39. It has been shown that the graft tension immediately after fixation is dependent on the 
knee angle and magnitude of tension applied immediately prior to fixation and that an increase in graft tension 
reduces knee laxity  17,38,39,81. The laxity -based approach implies that the tension in the graft is adjusted to 
produce an AP laxity value that is equal to or less than that of the contralateral normal knee, depending on a 
subject’s group assignment. A tension- based approach (e.g. 20 N, 40 N, etc) was not used for this study 
because the amount of force required to restor e AP laxity would be subject specific 15, and prone to other 
sources of error 40,75. Although a  laxity -based tensioning approach may require a variety of tension levels to be 
applied across patients within a treatment group, the tension applied to the graft in an effort to recreate normal 
AP laxity would be less than that required to over -constrain the joint, hence the terminology of “low -tension” 
versus “high -tension”. It is known that AP laxity values are significantly less when the graft is tensioned at 30o 
in comparison to full extension (0o), thus it is easy to control AP laxity by [CONTACT_423781]. The two initial tension treatments were controlled as follows. For the “low -tension” treatment, 
the tension was applied to the graft with the knee at 0o flexion (full extension). After an initial tension level was 
selected, the knee was flexed to 20o and an AP laxity test was performed (using the KT -1000S). The tension 
was adjusted iteratively unt il the AP laxity of the ACLR knee matched that of the contralateral limb (± 1.0 mm). 
For the “high -tension” treat ment, the tension was applied with the knee at 30o of flexion. The tension was 
adjusted until the AP laxity value at 20o of flexion is 2mm ( ±1.0 mm) less than the contralateral limb. The graft 
was then fixed with an interference screw, and the laxity value rechecked to ensure that the initial tension 
condition was maintained during fixation. The difference in knee flex ion angle at which the tension wa s applied 
between the high- tension treatment as compared to the low -tension treatment assists in producing a lower AP 
laxity value at 20o. Thus , higher forces are produced in the graft across the full range of knee flexion angles 
17,38,81. Another advantage of using AP laxity at the time of graft fixation to control graft tension was that 
changes in AP laxity can be measured at the post -operative follow -up visits as well. It would not be possible to 
directly measure graft forces immediately after graft fixation and at the follow -up visits if a tension- based 
approach was utilized. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_423771] (at +/ - 90 
N shear force) and to reduce AP laxity by  [CONTACT_2669] 1.5mm (at ± 90 N shear force) compared to the normal side 
using these initial graft -tensioning protocols. For the patients enrolled in the current study, the mean ( ± 
standard deviation) laxity difference at 133 N (reconstructed knee – control knee) for the high -tension group 
was -2.1 (±0.69) and -0.3 (±1.29) mm for the high- and low -tension groups, respectiv ely, with the “manual 
maximum” test  23. The required difference in AP laxity at the time of graft fixation between tensioning 
techniques (the independent variable) was achieved. 
 
5. Outcom e Measures  (dependent variables)  
 In this comprehensive evaluation of the effects of initial graft tension on ACLR , five sets of outcomes 
are under examination: 1) Imaging  assessment of OA progression; 2) Patient -oriented outcomes; 3) 
Knee kinematics; 4) Dynamic joint function; and 5) Clinical outcome.  Within each category  (Tables 2 &3), 
at least one test will be performed. In those categories featuring two or more tests, the first will be considered 
the primary test of that category.  
 
5.1. Imaging assessment of OA progression  
 
Joint Space Narrowing (radiography) : Measurement of joint space narrowing via radiographs is the 
current validated standard for quantifying the progression of OA in clinical studies 67, and is serving as 
the primary imaging outcome measure 54. Joint space width measure ments are obtained from radiographs 
based on  the semi -flexed metatarsophalangeal (MTP) view as originally described Buckland -Wright 14. The 
  
subjects stand facing the x -ray cassette with their weight evenly distributed between both feet. A custom 
designed platform that helps standardize limb and body position is used 29,54. The first MTP joint of each foot is 
aligned with, and below, the front edge of  the digital cassette. The subjects’ feet are then rotated 15° externally 
(determined by [CONTACT_423782] 2nd ray with the A- P axis), while maintaining the correct orientation of the MTP 
joint relative to the film cassette. The subjects then flex their knees until their patellae contact [CONTACT_423783]. 
With the subjects in position for the first time, outlines of their feet were drawn on a dedicated paper to produce a foot map that is then used when repositioning the subjects for the subsequent radiographs over the long-
term. Posterior -anterior radiographs are taken of each knee. Measurements of joint space width in  the medial 
and lateral compartments are then performed on the digital radiographs. The midpoint technique, as described 
by [CONTACT_423784]. 
58, is used to determine the joint space with custom developed software 54. Vertical lines are 
drawn at the medial and lateral aspects  of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus and through the respective 
apex of the tibial spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. A third vertical line is then drawn equidistant between the two lines describing each compartment. The measurement points are selected from the two bony intersections of the midpoint lines. 
Subjects are identified as having radiographic signs of OA if they exhibit a change in the medial or lateral 
compartments greater that 0.30mm over the study period 
51.

Subjective grading (radiography) : The overall condition of the joint  via radiographs will be graded 
using the system developed by [CONTACT_423785] 26. Weightbearing A- P, lateral and tunnel radiographs of the 
knees are taken before surgery and at the final follow -up visit. A grade of 0 (normal) to 3 (severe) will be 
assigned to six different radiographic factors: osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, femoral condyle 
flattening, subchondral cysts, ligament calcification,  and joint space narrowing. Each factor will be subdivided 
within regions of the knee. For example, osteophytes will be graded according to size (0=no osteophyte; 1=1 - 
to 3-mm; 2=4 - to 6-mm, and 3=<6- mm) in eight different sites; the medial femoral and tibial condyles, the 
lateral tibial and femoral condyles, femoral notch, tibial spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], femoral aspect of the patellofemoral j oint, and 
the patella. A total radiographic score of [ADDRESS_535375] (GAT), who is blinded to the subject number and the subject’s group assignment, 
evaluates all of the films.

¥From the sagittal T2*- weighted WE -3D FLASH  sequence, additional MR images will be reconstructed in both the   
transverse axial and coronal planes.  
 
Cartilage Thickness  (MRI): Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of both knees will be performed on a 3T 
whole- body scanner (Siemens TIM Trio; Erlangen, [LOCATION_013])  using a commercially available circularly -
polarized knee surface coil  to measure temporal changes in cartilage thickness 11,12. Scans were  
obtained at the time of recruitment and after 36 and 84 months of healing and will be taken at the 144- and 
180-month follow -up visits . The cartilage thickness  calculations will be based on the sagittal water -excitation 
T1-weighted 3D FLASH  sequence ( Table 4). A trained technologist, under the direction of the radiologist, will 
perform manual segmentations on all slices (1.5mm) for each knee using Mimics software 11. MRI's will be 
segmented in pairs and blinded to sequence.  Segmented slices will then be grouped to generate a 3- D mesh 
to represent the volumetric shape 11,12,65. Once segmented, the cartilage structure will be registered between 
the multiple scans of the same subject taken at 0, 36, [ADDRESS_535376] point algorithm 20-22,53,60. This will enable alignment of the cartilage between time points (0 , 
36, 60 and 84 months) with a point -wise description of change. We will then focus our thickness 
measurements to the cartilage regions of the tibiofemoral joint with the greatest load bearing requirements. A 
cylinder will be fit to the bone- cartilage interface of the femoral cartilage of the reconstructed images. The 
notch marking the junction between the TF and patellofemoral joints on the lateral condyle is easy to identify 
on the sagittal MR view. A line will then be drawn from the notch (0o) to the center of the cylinder 12. Each 
condyle of the TF joint will then be divided at 40o, 70o, 100o, and 130o from the notch point toward the posterior 
aspect of the condyles to create 6 patches of cartilage (3 medial, 3 lateral); the width of each patc h will be 20% 
of the overall width of the femoral cartilage and centered about the midline of each condyle ( Fig. 6). Two 
patches on the tibial cartilage (1 medial, 1 lateral) will also be defined by [CONTACT_423786] (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, 
MA). The inertial axes will serve as a coordinate system, and the patch in each compartment will be defined as 
the area ±20% of the overall depth (A -P) and ±15% of the overall width (M -L) from the centroid 12. The average 
thickness of each  patch will be calculated by [CONTACT_423787].  The cartilage volume will be quantified for the 
  
tibia and femur by [CONTACT_423788] 32. The cartilage volumes will be normalized by [CONTACT_423789] 0 data set (pre- operative visit) in order to increase the construct validity of the measurement 47. Subjects 
will be labeled as having OA if they exhibit a cartilage volume loss exceeding 2.5% per year over the study 
period. This value was selected because patients without OA have been shown to have changes of 0.5% per 
year while those with OA lose approximately 4- 6% per year 43. Although the changes in the cartilage volume 
for the femur will be assessed, the focus will be on the volume changes of the tibial condyles where OA is 
easiest to detect 18, and most affected by [CONTACT_423790] 36. Note: Due to problems with artifact, this outcome 
measure was discontinued. The other imaging outcome measures were performed as originally planned.  
Whole Organ Magnetic Imaging Score (secondary MRI measure) : The general status of the  knee will be 
independently assessed by [CONTACT_423791] (G. Tung) and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_423772] -
quantitative WORM score 56,71,77. The scoring utilizes four MR sequences (Table 5). The images are sc ored 
with respect to 14 independent features 56. Cartilage signal and morphology (8- point  scale), subarticular bone 
marrow abnormality (4 -point scale), subarticular cysts (4 -point scale), subarticular bone attrition (4 -point scale), 
and marginal osteophytes (8 -point scale) will be evaluated in 15 regions (2 in the patella, 6 in the femur, 7 in 
the tibia). The regions are subdivided by [CONTACT_423792] 56. In addition, 
the menisci (5 -point s), cruciate and collateral ligaments (2 -points each), synovitis (4- points), loose bodies (4-
points), and periarticular cysts (3 -points)  are scored. A to tal of [ADDRESS_535377] assessing the WORM scores has the expertise in doing so for ACL injured patients 28,73,74. 
 
5.2. Patient -reported  outcomes  
 
The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)  and the Medical Outcomes Study Short 
Form -36 (SF- 36) will be used to assess patient -oriented outcomes.  The KOOS addresses k nee 
performance and was designed and validated to monitor changes in outcome and the progression of OA following ligament and meniscal injuries 
59. The KOOS is a self -administered questionnaire that evaluates 
treatment outcomes within 5- categories: 1) pain, 2) symptoms, 3) acti vities of daily living, 4) sports and 
recreation function, and 5) knee related quality of life. All questions within each category are scored on a 5-point scale. The scores within each category are added to produce a scoring profile (on a scale of 100 for each 
of the five categories) that can be followed over time. A 15 -point decrease in the KOOS is equival ent to the 
difference between a “mild” and “moderate” deficit 
59. Although all five scores are evaluated, those that are 
most sensitive to change after ACLR are the KOOS -quali ty of life and the KOOS -sports 59. These are expected 
to provide the greatest insight into the patient -oriented outcome of ou r patients. The SF-36 is a validated, self -
administered instrument that is commonly used to monitor general health and to evaluate treatment effects in 
clinical studies 76. It assesses physical function, role limitations due to physical health issues, bodily pain, 
vitality, social functioning, mental health, and reported health transition.  
  
5.3. Knee kinemat ics 
 A-P laxity : Passive laxity measurements  
24,27, that are obtained with the leg muscles relaxed, are an important 
outcome since they assess ligamentous and capsular function, are predictive of the graft material properties 
6,44, and correlate with radiographic change in ACL- deficient knees 26. The KT -[ADDRESS_535378] reliable of the 
commercially available knee laxity measurement devices 37,66, and is used by [CONTACT_423793] A -P laxity. For this study, A -P laxity is defined as the amount of A -P dire cted translation of the tibia 
(relative to the femur) between the shear load limits of -90 N (posterior) and 133 N (anterior). A -P laxity 
(instead of anterior laxity) was selected since variability is reduced when sagittal plane laxity is referenced to a posterior shear load rather than zero load 
23,37. 
 
5.4. Dynamic joint function  
 
Isokinetic strength testing is performed to assess the strength of the quadriceps muscles.  Isokinetic 
strength of the quadriceps has been shown to be a predictor of the peak external flexion moments that is produced during jogging (r
2 = 0.83) 16,55. The clinical coordinator administers the tests using the Biodex System 
3 (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc. Shirley NY) located in our research facility. The subjects are positioned on the 
  
device with its axis of rotation aligned with the transepi[INVESTIGATOR_423773] s of the femoral condyles. The subjects 
perform the tests at 60o/sec 16. Averaging the peak torques of five repetitions and normalizing these values w ith 
respect to bodyweight and height quantifies peak quadriceps strength. Both knees are tested.  Note: The 
isokinetic testing system failed after the 84- month follow -ups were completed. The system was not replaced 
and thus will not be used for the [ADDRESS_535379] for 
distance independently on each leg. Three trials for each are recorded and averaged. The difference in 
distance between the reconstructed and the normal knee is calculated.  
 5.5. Clinical outcome  
 
Clinical outcome will be assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee 
rating scale  23,48. The IKDC rating has been validated for ACLR 48. The IKDC scores evaluate four categories: 
1) the patient’s subjective assessment of function, 2) symptoms, 3) range of knee motion, and 4) clinical examination. The IKDC  score rates knees as normal, nearly normal, abnormal, and severely abnormal, which 
can be transformed to an ordinal scale of 1 (normal) to 4 (severely abnormal). The final IKDC rating is then 
based on the score of the worst category 
48. In a ddition, height, weight, body mass index, thigh circumference 
(6cm above joint line) and the number of recurrent injury epi[INVESTIGATOR_423774]. A sports medicine physician

examinations.  
 6. Controlled Variables  
 
Investigators have shown that the initial graft tension level required to restore normal knee laxity is 
specific to the graft material, cross -sectional area of the graft, and the free length of the graft between 
fixation sites 
15, and these were controlled in this study.  Initially, subjects undergoing ACL reconstruction 
using a bone- patellar tendon- bone autograft were recruited to control the variability due to graft type. However, 
there has been a recent surge in the popularity of the 4- stranded hamstring tendon graft. Thus , we elected to 
recruit patients who were candidates for ACL reconstruction with 4- stranded hamstring autografts  to increase 
our population base. This was justified because recent biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the 
structural properties of the patellar tendon autograft are equal to that of  the [ADDRESS_535380] on the graft elongation pattern 45. A graft that is placed to far anterior on the femur 
will cause it to get tight in flexion and slack in extension. Likewise, a graft that is placed in the “over -the-top” 
position will get tight in extension and slack in flexion. Thus, intra- articular graft position may influence the 
healing response 9,70. Howev er, all the surgeons utilized the same drill guide system and anatomical landmarks 
to standardize graft position across subjects. Although variation may still exist, we have previously shown that they are equally distributed within each treatment group 
9.  
 
Another standardized variable, which could possibly affect outcome, is the rehabilitation program 
prescribed following surgery 8. Recent data comparing commonly used rehabilitation protocols suggest 
otherwise. We have shown that rehabilitation with either an “accelerated” or “non- accelerated” program 
produces the same outcome with respect to AP knee laxity, clinical assessment, patient satisfacti on, functional 
performance, strength, and proprioception 5,8. In the current study, all subjects were required to follow the 
“accelerated” rehabilitation program. They received supervised post -operative physical therapy for a minimum 
of 16 weeks. Because the patients were randomly assigned to each treatment group, we feel that any deviation 
from the rehabilitation program (either produced by [CONTACT_102]’s inability to keep up with the program , or the 
patient’s unwill ingness to follow the prescribed rehabilitation) was equally distributed between the two groups.  
 
  
7. Protocol  Summary  
 
When a subject  (either surgical or control) consents to continue their participation in the study, 144- 
and 180- month  follow -up assessments will be performed . All patients have been previously enrolled into 
the study. However,  the lay summary consent forms were based on a n 84-month follow -up. Therefore, the 
subjects will need to be re- consented in order to participate in the extended study . The clinical coordinator will 
consent the patients after contact[CONTACT_423794] a phone call follow -up. Within the initial contact [CONTACT_31711], a 
card will be provided so that the subject can let us know if they do not want us to contact [CONTACT_136028].   
 The clinical examinations will occur at the sports medicine clinic of University Orthopaedics Inc.  At the 
first visit ( 144 month), the subject will meet  with the clinical coordinator to finalize the consent forms. Once the 
subject has granted informed c onsent, an X-ray technician will acquire the radiographs for the joint space width 
measuremen ts. These will be obtained under the direction of the clinical coordinator who will make sure all the 
necessary steps required to reposition the patient relative t o the x -ray system  are taken . A research physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_423776] (IKDC). At this time, the clinical coordinator will 
administer the questionnaires (SF -36; KOOS; Tegner), the A -P laxity exam (KT -1000) and the functional 
assessment ( One- leg hop). The clinical coordinator will also schedule the MRI examination, which will be 
performed at another site.  
 The MRIs will be performed at the MRI Research Facility at Brown University under the guidance of a 
certified MR techni cian. The scans (Table 4) will be performed using the TIMS Trio scanner . The scans will 
be WORM scored by a board- certified radiologist with expertise in musculoskeletal MR.  
 All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_423795] a visit is not 
scheduled.  The primary reason for this will be to keep all of the subjects engaged in the study.  
 
8. Statistical analyses  
 
Treatment Comparisons - Prima ry Outcome Measure:  Repeated measures analysis of variance will be 
used to evaluate differences among treatment groups with respect to temporal changes in joint space width (i.e. joint space narrowing). The statistical model will include fixed factors repr esenting treatment group (“low -
tension”, “high -tension” and “control”), limb (operative vs. contra -lateral or two controls), location (medial vs. 
lateral), time (baseline, 12- , 36-, 60-, and 84 -month), and their interactions. If significant interactions ar e 
detected, simple effects will be compared using the Student -Newman- Keuls procedure based on the 
appropriate error terms 
80. Because one of the repeated factors (i.e. time) is quantitative, orthogonal polynomial 
will be used to partition the time effect into its individual quantitative components (i.e. linear and quadratic). The 
significance of these orthogonal contrasts will be used to evaluate the linearity (or non- linearity) of the temporal 
trend associated with degeneration. Analyses will be performed usin g SAS, PROC MIXED 52 that allows for 
covariance structures other than compound symmetry (e.g. unstructured, autoregressive, spatial power law). It is expected that the variability across subjects may increase across time due to only a subset of individuals 
exhibiting degeneration, which would violate the standard homogeneity of variance assumptions. The normality 
assumption will be examined based on residuals using normal probability plots and the Wilk-Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_423777]. If 
necessary, data will be transformed prior to analysis in order t o satisfy the distributional assumptions.  
 
Treatment Comparisons - Secondary Outcome Measures:  Repeated measures analyses of variance will 
also be used to test for differences in secondary outcome measures corresponding to knee kinematics, 
dynamic function, patient reported  outcomes, and clinical outcomes. For measures that are performed on each 
limb (e.g. A -P laxity ), the statistical model  will include fixed factors representing treatment group, limb, and 
time, along with their interactions. Repeated measures analyses on secondary outcome that are not limb-
specific (e.g. KOOS and SF36) will include only treatment, time, and their interaction as factors. Post hoc analyses involving tests of simple effects and orthogonal polynomials will be similar to methodology previously 
described for joint space width. Because specific secondary outcome measures are assessed more frequently 
in the two experimental arms  than in the control group ( Tables 2&3), direct post hoc comparisons involving the 
two tension groups and  examination of temporal trend in these group will utilize the additional assessments.  
 
  
Relationship between A -P Laxity and Progression of  OA: The longitudinal relationship between A -P laxity 
and progression of OA as measured by [CONTACT_423796] (both  radiographically and using MRI) will be 
examined in the context of hierarchical linear modeling 13, also known as random coefficient modeling. Using 
data obtained from the experimental subjects, SAS PROC MIXED will be employed to examine the association 
between individual subjects' changes in A -P laxity with the ir changes in joint space width (radiography) or 
cartilage thickness (MRI) . This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_163297] A -P laxity as a covariate (predictor) that 
would potentially chang e over time with joint space width and cartilage thickness being consider ed as the 
dependent measures. Individual subjects are modeled based on unique intercepts and slopes corresponding to 
time and the covariat e. Across subject factors such as tension group, gender, graft type, and age will also be 
considered. A similar analysis will be performed to establish the relationship between isokinetic strength, KOOS, functional testing  and OA progression.  
 
Missing Visits and Subject Loss to Follow -up: Unlike traditional software used for repeated measures 
analyses (e.g. SAS PROC GLM and BMDP -2V), PROC MIXED appropriately handles incomplete data due to 
missed visits without completely excluding subjects from the analysis. The pattern of missing data is assumed 
to be random, which in- practice, is likely to be violated to some degree. We will test for differences in the rate 
of missed visits across treatment groups and across time using categorical repeated measures (SAS, PROC 
CATMOD). The proportion of subjects that are loss to follow -up will be compared across treatment and control 
arms  using a chi square test.  Though we are finding that missed visits are infrequent and most likely equally 
distributed across treatment gr oups, we will examine whether specific baseline characteristics that may be 
predictive of outcome are also associated with missed visits using logistic regression. We recruit ed [ADDRESS_535381] 46 assessable subjects per group at the three -year follow -up visit based on the 
estimated 15% dropout rate.  We have more than met this goal (3% drop out in our treatment groups and 15% 
drop out in our control group at [ADDRESS_535382] 35 patients/subjects in each group (20% drop out rate of subjects currently enrolled).  
 
Justification of Sample Size based on Primary Outcome Measure:  The estimated  sample size of 35 
assessable subjects per group through the 84- month study period will result  in having sufficient power (1-
β=0.80 using α=.05) to detect a mean difference between groups of 0.[ADDRESS_535383] 
shown that patients with primary OA exhibit an estimated 0.3 -mm change in joint space width per year 
51,63. 
Since we will be studying patients at the time of OA onset, we will assume that patients who undergo initial 
changes will exhibit an average joint space narrowing of 0.1 mm per year, or a total of  approximately  0.6 mm  
over the 84 months. This estimate was conservatively adjusted based on the study by [CONTACT_423797], who found 
that only 50% of the subjects that undergo ACL reconstruction after injury exhibit early degenerative changes 
following surgery 50. After taking into account that only a subset of subjects randomized may exhibit OA, the 
resulting mean difference is decreased to be 0.[ADDRESS_535384] to joint space narrowing. The variability estimate used in 
our computations ( σ
∆=0.35 mm) resulted from increasing the estimate derived from the liter ature for a group of 
subjects with OA in order to reflect our expected mixture of two subsets of subjects. Based on each subset having σ
∆=0.20, with 50% of the patients exhibiting narrowing a t otal of 0.6 mm and 50% showing no 
degeneration, the resulting overall estimated σ∆=0.35. Assuming joint space width at baseline is approximately 
4.5 mm 30, this detectable mean difference (0.25 mm) represents an approximate 5% change between the 
treatment groups in the mean rate of degeneration. We recruited [ADDRESS_535385] 46 
assessable subjects per group at the three -year follow -up visit based on the estimated 15% dropout rate 4,7. 
We have more than met this goal (3% drop out in our treatment groups and 15% drop out in our control group 
at 3 year s). For the proposed 180-month follow -up we expect that we will have at least 35 patients/subjects in 
each group (20% drop out rate of  subjects currently enrolled).   
 
Power for Secondary Outcome Measures:  Having determined the number of subjects needed to have 
sufficient power to detect expected differences in joint space narrowing, we computed the magnitude of the 
detectable difference for the main secondary outcome measures.  These estimates are based on our previous 
data and values found in the literature. When the estimates were based on cross -sectional data from the 
literature (i.e. isokinetic strength), moderate correlation across time was assumed ( r=0.50). The following mean 
differences correspond to the estimated power=0.80 and α=.05 with the proposed sample sizes: A- P laxity = 
  
1.25 mm (a 16% change relative to the normal A -P laxity value 72); isokinetic knee strength = 18.5 Nm (a 12% 
change relative to normal, a “mild” deficit 16); KOOS - QOL score = 10.5 (a 10% change relative to full scale, 
considered less than a mild deficit 59); KOOS -sports score = 1 0.1 (a 10% change relative to full scale, 
considered less than a mild deficit 59), and IKDC score =.50 (a 12% change relative to normal 48). 
 
Note  (9/29/2017) : The 7 year data were completed and published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine 
in January 2016 ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27159308 ). The study was extended to [ADDRESS_535386].

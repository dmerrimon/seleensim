Digital delivery of  parent tr aining for disruptive behaviors: Increasing Access to Care  
 
I. Significance  and Specific Aims : Disruptive behaviors are among the most common reason s for mental 
health referral in children, and among the most costly childhood condition s.[ADDRESS_627449] to one -half of 
children with disruptive behavior disor ders also meet criteria for ADHD, and comorbidity typi[INVESTIGATOR_488399].2,3 Parent training programs are clinically effective in the  treatment of  children’s disruptive 
behaviors , and are included in the  recommendations set forth in AACAP and AAP treatment guidelines.  
However, such behavioral treatment is inaccessible to most families in need .[ADDRESS_627450], parents’ limited time availability, lack of trained staff, stigma and skepticism of the 
pediatric mental health system .4 The underutilization of parent behavior management training for disruptive 
behaviors was identifi ed as a practice gap by [CONTACT_488406] 2017 .5 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_488400], 
children  are often prescribed psychotropic medication without  evidence -based behavioral  interventions 
such  as parent training .6 To overcome some of these barriers  to high quality care , online delivery of 
evidence -based  parent management training  (Digital Parent Training  (DPT))  has been developed .[ADDRESS_627451] demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, the majority provide  only self-
guided static content without clinical guidance, or the capacity for  ‘dose -adjustment’ or  gradual escalation of 
care based on participants’ needs .[ADDRESS_627452] a 
model of interactive  DPT (iDPT)  for disruptive behavior s and irritability in young children that augments 
traditional  digital  parent training with interactive clinic al guidance and consultation.  Content for  this iDPT 
approach closely follows  core principles and techniques of parent -training methods  that have been 
thoroughly  tested in clinical trials at the Yale Child Study Center .9-11 Through the iDPT program, clinicians  
will provide  parents with support  and guidance  through  “in-app” asynchronous messaging , scheduled 
video -conferencing and can facilitate referral to  the Yale Child Study Center Outpatient Clinic when 
necessary.  Our long -term goal  is to run a large RCT to study the clinical efficacy of  interactive  DPT for 
disruptive behaviors in children across multiple sites and populations . We must first establish acceptability 
and feasibility of this approach  with an open trial before proceeding to a larger RCT.  
 
Specific aim #1:  Examine acceptability and feasibility of  iDPT in children  with clinically significant levels of 
irritability and disruptive behavior , ages  4 to 9 years. Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_488407], completion of the online modules, and the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire 
(PSQ) .6  
We hypothesize that >80% of enrolled subject s will complete all of the online modules and attend 2 of the 3 
videoconferencing sessions. We hypothesize that  the majority of  parents will rate the iDPT  as acceptable 
based on the Patient Satisfaction Questionn aire (PSQ) , as evidenced by [CONTACT_30404] 3.0 . 
 
Specific Aim #2:  Analyze the effect  of iDPT on child disruptive behaviors  as measured with the Disruptive 
Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS) .[ADDRESS_627453] that children  whose parents complete the intervention  will demonstrate a significant decrease in 
disruptive behavi ors as assessed by [CONTACT_488408] (DBRS).    
 
III. Background and Rationale : Disruptive behavior disorders in children include conduct disorder, 
oppositional defiant disorder, and disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control approximately 3.5% of US children have a diagnosable disruptive behavior 
disorder .13 Nearly 30% of children who present oppositional defiant behaviors develop a conduct disorder .[ADDRESS_627454] Letter of Intent  Andrea Diaz Stransky (Page 2) 
health problems and relationship difficulties, even after controlling for confounding factors .2 A sub -
population that is in higher need of treatment are children with ADHD. This is because n early 50% of 
children with ADHD have co -occurring  disruptive behavior disorders, and this worsens clinical prognosis .1,[ADDRESS_627455] for prevention and treatment of behavioral problems in children is parent training, a 
systematic  approach to help parents manage their children’s disruptive behaviors .15 Nevertheless, parent 
participation in in-person treatment is estimated between 10 -34%, and those who enroll attend 35 -50% of 
sessions .[ADDRESS_627456] this intervention in a  larger  Randomized  
Control Trial.   
 
IV. Research Plan  
Participants . In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will enroll 16 children with disruptive behaviors disorder  recruited at 
Yale Health  and Yale Medicine  Pediatric Outpatient Service s.  
Inclusion criteria:  i. Child is ages [ADDRESS_627457] access to a 
mobile device  and/or computer devic e, iv. Parents speak English as native language , v. Affective Reactivity 
Index parent -report score is above  3.6, which is the mean for children with severe irritability , vi. Families 
agree not to initiate new mental health treatments for the duration of this study.  The sample will be enriched 
with children with ADHD, by [CONTACT_488409] 50% of participant s meet criteria for ADHD based on 
parent and teacher ratings above 1.8.  
Exclusion criteria:  i. Child is non -verbal or minimally verbal; or ii. Child’s tantrums or aggressive behavior 
pose significant risk of injury or property damage and require immediate treatment ; or iii. child has 
untreated medical or psychiatric disorder that requires immediate intervention ; or iv. parents have 
previously received parent -training . 
Design  This is an open , feasibility  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] o f interactive digital parent training for  children with disruptive 
behaviors . iDPT is  a novel web -based , interactive parenting intervention for disruptive behavior in children. 
Following the principles of testing feasibility and acceptability  as the first step in developi[INVESTIGATOR_488401]17, a comparison group will not be included in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]. Participants will be 
recruited through the Yale Health  and Yale Medicine  Pediatrics outpatient service s. Parents who choose to 
enroll will undergo telephone screening, and if likely to be  eligible , they will be invited to a n in-person 
AACAP Pi[INVESTIGATOR_488402] (Page 3) 
clinical characterization visit. As an incentive to participate, parents will be offered $50 upon completion of 
in-person clinical characterization visit and $[ADDRESS_627458] in the study will be contact[CONTACT_488410] (the 
Principal Investigator) . A brief description of the study will be provided, and eligibility will be determined 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria that do not require clinical assessment. I f the subject is 
deemed likely to be eligible , they will be invited to attend an in -person clinical characterization assessment 
at the Yale Child Study Center Outpatient Clinic.  At the in -person  characterization  visit, a desc ription of the 
study will be provided . Formal consent will be obtained  from the parent and assent from the child . The 
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School -Age Children -Present and Lifetime Version 
(K-SADS -PL)22, a structured  interview  will be conducted  with parent and child by [CONTACT_079], 
to establish Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM -5) diagnoses . The items, 
which are drawn directly from DSM -IV, are scored from 0 (never) to 3 (very often) and can be scor ed in two 
different ways: symptom count (number of items rated 2 or 3) and symptom severity (sum of the scores for 
the specific diagnostic subscale). Of interest in the current study are the following subscales: attention -
deficit/ hyperactivity disorder [A DHD; 18 items], oppositional defiant disorder [ODD; 8 items], pervasive 
developmental disorder [PDD; 12 items], and the [ADDRESS_627459] children whose disruptive behaviors are above  3.6, the mean for 
children with severe irritability.23,24  Parent and teacher scales of the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham 
Questionnaire (SNAP) will be used to ascertain ADHD di agnosis . This is to enrich the sample with 50% or 
more children with ADHD,  a proportion of the sample that is reflective of prevalence in children with 
disruptive behaviors .[ADDRESS_627460] Health . This 
platform  is a parent -focused  learning management system that was accepted into the Yale Entrepreneurial 
Institute Venture Creation Program. The iDPT program  comprises 8 modules  that closely adhere in content 
to evidence -based Parent Management Training (PMT. The digital platform has undergone comprehensive  
user testing with parents of children with disruptive behaviors to assess the software functioning . The 
content is delivered in parent -friendly and accessible language and the parent training principles are 
illustrated using animate d simulations of a parent and child, with voice -over from a narrator.  A demo is 
available at https://dev.mindnesthealth.com/#/demo . The modules are delivered as follows:  Week s 1-2: 
The first two modules  (“Introduction to tantrums” and “The ABC’s of Behavior”) provide background and 
foundational concepts of behavioral management .  After completion of module  2, parents will be scheduled 
for a 30 -minute videoconference with the lead cli nician to identify specific disruptive  or noncompliant 
behaviors in their child that parents want to decrease.  Week s 3-4:  Modules  3, 4, and 5 teach parents 
antecedent management skills.  Parents will be instructed to choose  different skills , one skill at  a time , to try 
out at home for 1 week, with clinician  support via in -app messaging. After 2 week s of practice, during 
videoconference #2, the lead clinician  will address any barriers to implementation and instruct parents  on 
track ing their child’s behaviors and progress.  Week s 5-6:  Modul es 6, 7, and 8 address reinforcement of 
positive behaviors.  Parents will be instructed to try out several reinforcement techniques for 2 week s.  The 
final videoconference #[ADDRESS_627461] Letter of Intent  Andrea Diaz Stransky (Page 4) 
At the end of the study, participants will be asked to complete the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire 
(PSQ)6, which is an 8 -item measure of satisfaction with treatment. Parent and child version s are available, 
and both will be administered. Items such as “how satisfied were you with the treatment you have 
received?” and “would you recommend this treatment to a friend?” are rated on a [ADDRESS_627462] 
(Hypothesis 1) that parent ratings of patient satisfaction with this iDPT  will be high as evidenced by [CONTACT_488411] 3.[ADDRESS_627463] for continuity of care, they will be referred to the 
Yale Child Study Center Outpa tient Clinic for follow -up. 
 
Data Analysis : 1. Acceptability  and Feasibility Analysis.  Feasibility will be examined with three 
measures : a) completion of 80 or more of the modules and b) attendance to two of the three 
videoconferencing sessions. Parent’s p erspective on acceptability of the intervention will be assessed 
utilizing the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire . We will deem the treatment acceptable if parents select  
responses ‘Slightly Agree’ or ‘Agree’ on the 15 Acceptability factor items.  This will be reflected as a score of 
3.0 or above on the PSQ.  We will use fixed effects analysis of variance to compare session 
attendance/online course completion and scores on the PSQ.   2. Child  Outcome. At baseline and 
endpoint, parents will complete t he DBRS . We will compute  pre-to post -treatment differences on the DBRS 
and examine the number of subjects showing clinically meaningful reduction in the DB RS total score. By 
[CONTACT_559], a DBRS score of 12 is considered clinically significant . A 35% reducti on in DBRS score is 
considered “improved” and a 50% reduction is considered “much improved.”  Given that traditional parent -
training interventions show clinically significant improvement in approximately 60% of participants, we 
predict that 10 of 16 subjects in this open study (63%) will show a clinically meaningful reduction of the 
DBRS score. Because the primary aim of this study is to determine feasibility, the data analysis for the 
second aim of estimating the magnitude of change in the continuou s outcome measure, DBRS, will be 
straightforward. We will use paired -samples t -test to examine the differences between baseline and 
endpoint DBRS scores.  Based on previous studies from our group23, we can project for a change from 
DBRS mean score of 15 (S D=5) at baseline to 10 (SD=5) and endpoint. This difference can be detected 
with statistical power > 80% and alpha level < 0.05 in a sample of 1 6 subjects.   
Feasibility :  [CONTACT_488412], t he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_488403], is a  Solnit  adult and child 
psychiatry fellow at the Yale Child Study Center who will be in her Post -graduate year [ADDRESS_627464] Mission:   The principal investigator [CONTACT_832] a talented young physician -scientist
